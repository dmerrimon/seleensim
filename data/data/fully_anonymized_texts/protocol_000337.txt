1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: 
APhase II, Open -Label, Mult i-Centre, International Safet y Study  of Durvalumab Fo llowing 
Sequent ial Chemotherapy  and Radiati on Therapy  in Pati ents wi th Stage III, Unresectable 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (PACIFIC 6)
Rationale:
This study  is being conducted to provide safet y, efficacy, and quality of life (QoL) data to 
complement the resul ts of the PACIFIC Study , which assessed treatment with durvalumab
(MEDI4736) in pat ients with unresectable Stage III non-small cell  lung cancer ( NSCLC )who 
had not progressed after con current chemoradiation therapy  (cCRT). Durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) was approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
for the treatm ent of  unresectable Stage III NSCLC in February  2018. This study  will expand 
on the data currently availa ble fro m the PACIFIC Study  by [CONTACT_72925] (MEDI4736) inpatients who have not progressed after s equent ial chemoradiat ion 
therapy (sCRT), and in patients of World Heal th Organisat ion/Eastern Cooperative Oncology  
Group Performance Status 0 to 1 and 2 (WHO/ECOG PS 0 to 1 and 2).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 14of 159Tumour assessments
Tumour assessments will be performed as per RECIST 1.1 criteria , using com puted 
tomography (CT) /magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) .  The baseline assessment is part of the 
screening procedures and should be performed wit hin [ADDRESS_78990] of 
care (SoC) within [ADDRESS_78991] dose of study  drug, butprior to si gning the inform ed 
consent form (ICF) , can be used for screening purposes if the patient consents to the use of 
those results .  Efficacy for all pat ients will be assessed by [CONTACT_72929] 
8weeks (q8w) for the first 12 months andevery 12 weeks (q12w) thereafter, until confirmed 
objective disease progressio n as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (irrespect ive of the reason for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72895]/or initiation o f subsequent therapy ).  If an unscheduled assessment is 
perform ed and the pati ent has not progressed, every  attem pt shoul d be made to perform  the 
subsequent a ssessments at their scheduled visits.  The schedule of imagi ng radi ological 
assessments must be fo llowed regardl ess of  any dose del ays wi th durval umab (MEDI4736) .
Progression during treatment
During the treatment period, patients who are clinically stable at an init ial 
RECIST 1.1‑defined radio logical PDmay continue to receive study  drug at the discretion of 
the Invest igator and patient , after re -consent ing for treatment through progression .  A 
follow-up scan is to be perform edafter the ini tial RECIST 1.1-defined radio logical PD, no 
less than 4 weeks after the prior assessment of PDand no l ater than the next regularly  
scheduled imaging visit, and this scan is evaluated using the Confirmat ion of Radio logical  
Progression Criteria.  If the subsequent scan doe s not confirm the immediate prior radiological 
PD, then the patient may  cont inue on study  drug at the discretion of the Investigator and after
the pati ent has consented to do so; imaging assessments shoul d cont inue unt il the next 
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_78992] started a subsequent

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 15of 159Steering Committee
A Steering Co mmittee (SC) will be assembled by [CONTACT_72930] n of the study .  The SC will consist of onco logy experts and a statistic ian who serve 
their role through regular scheduled meet ings or teleconferences and, if necessary, addit ional 
ad hoc meetings.
Interim analysis
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study .  However, the SC will conduct an early  
safet y evaluat ion when 10 patients in the WHO/ECOG PS [ADDRESS_78993].  At the time of the early safet y evaluat ion, safety  data for pati ents in the WHO/ECOG 
PS0to1 cohort will also be provided to the SC for completeness in the overall risk/benefit 
assessment.  If needed for publicat ion purposes, an additional early  assessment of study  data 
may be conducted when minimum 50 patients in the WHO/ECOG PS 0to1cohort or 
WHO/ECOG PS [ADDRESS_78994] had the opportunity to receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) for a 
minimum o f 6months.
Statistical methods
The primary  object ive of this study  is to assess the safet y and tole rabilit y of durvalumab
(MEDI4736) , defined as Grade 3 and Grade 4 treatment -related adverse events ( TRAEs)
observed during the init ial 6months of durvalumab (MEDI4736) treatm ent.  In addit ion, 
safet y and tolerabilit y of durvalumab (MEDI4736) will be chara cterized for the cohort sof 
WHO/ECOG PS [ADDRESS_78995] itute (NCI)Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Event 
(CTCAE ) Grade based on the safet y analysis set (ie, all pat ients who received at least 1 dose 
of study  drug).  The exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the incidence of Grade 3 and 
Grade 4 TRAEs will be reported for patients overall and separately for the co hortsof 
WHO/ECOG PS 0 to 1 and 2 pati ents.
The m edian progressi on-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) , as well as the 
median time to NSCLC -related death, together with their corresponding 95% CIs will be 
calculated using Kaplan -Meier prod uct limit methods and will be reported for patients overall 
and separately for the cohorts of WHO/ECOG PS 0 to 1 and 2 pati ents.  In addit ion, the 
objective response rate (ORR) (based on Invest igator assessment by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria), 
together with the corresponding 95% CI, will be reported for patients overall and separately 
for the cohorts of WHO/ECOG PS 0 to 1 and 2 patients.
This is a safet y study  and no form al sample size calculat ion will be done.  Between 100 and 
120patients will be enrolled in the WHO/ECOG PS 0 to 1 Cohort and up to 30 patients in the

1.2 Schedule of assessments
The procedures for the screening and treatment periods in this study  are presented in Table 1,
and the procedures for the fo llow-up peri od are presented in Table 2(Schedule of assessments 
[SoA]) .
When ever vital sign assessments and blood draws are scheduled for the same no minal t ime, 
the assessments should occur in the fo llowing order: vi tal signs and then blood draws.  
Whenever electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign s assessments , and blood draws are sc heduled 
for the sam e nominal t ime, the assessments should occur in the fo llowing order: ECG, vital 
signassessments , and then blood draws. 
Patients m ay delay  dosing due to immune -mediated adverse events (imAEs) or non -imAEs or 
for reasons other than TRAE .
In case of imAEs or non -imAE s, dosing may  be delayed per the Dosing Modificat ion and 
Toxicit y Management Guidelines (Secti on8.4.5 ).
If dosing must be delayed for reasons other than TRAEs , dosing will resume as soon as 
feasible.
One cycle of treatm ent wi th the IP is equal to 28 calendar days.
Dosing intervals of subsequent cy cles may  be shortened as clinically  feasible in order to 
gradually  align treatm ent cy cles wi th the schedule of tum our efficacy  (RECIST ) and PRO 
assessments. Subsequent time between 2 consecutive doses cannot be less than 22 days, 
based on the half -life of durvalumab (MEDI4736) (see current Invest igator Brochure [IB]).
If imaging procedures were performed for alternate reasons prior to signing consent, these can 
be used for screening purposes with consent of the patient.  However, all screening imagin g 
resul ts must have been obtained within [ADDRESS_78996] IP dose administration .
PROs and tum our efficacy  (RECIST) assessment dates are not affected by  [CONTACT_72931], as they  are based on the date of first IP administratio n (not the 
date of therapy ).
All other scheduled assessments must be performed relat ive to the start of the dosing cycle 
such that all laboratory  procedures, etc, required for dosing should be performed within 
3calendar days pri or to dosing.

Durvalumab (MEDI4736) , D4194C00006
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24of [ADDRESS_78997] commo n cancer in the world for several decades (WHO 2012 ).  
In 2012, there were an estimated 1.8 millio n new cases, representing 12.9% of all new 
cancers.  It was also the most commo n cause o f death fro m cancer worldwide , with 
1.59 millio n deaths ( 19.4% of the total).  NSCLC represents approximately 80% to 85% of all 
lung cancers (American Cancer Societ y 2016 ) and approximately 30% of  patients present with 
Stage III disease (Cancer Treatm ent Centers of America 2017) .  
Standard treatment for patients with a good performance status (PS) and unresectable Stag e III 
NSCLC has been platinum -based doublet chemotherapy  concurrent wi th radiotherapy
(chemoradiat ion therapy  [CRT]) administered with curative intent (Yoon et al 2017 ).  
However, the median PFS among pat ients who have received CRT is poor (approximately 
8months)(Ahn et al 2015) .  A meta-analysis o f cCRT versus sCRT showed better outcomes 
with cCRT , but even wi th cCRT, the 5-year OS is only approximately 15% ( Aupérin et al 
2010 ).
More recent ly, the PACIFIC Study (D4191C00001) demonstrated that the addit ion of 
durvalumab (MEDI4736) following platinum -based cCRT si gnificantly improves PFS 
(Antoni a et al  2017 ).  The median PFS with durvalumab (MEDI4736) was 16.8 months (95% 
CI 13.0 ,18.1) versus 5.6months with placebo (95% CI :4.6,7.8), and with a stratified hazard 
ratio (HR) for disease progr ession or death of 0.52 (95% CI :0.42,0.65; p<0.001).  The 
response rate was higher with durvalumab (MEDI4736) versus placebo (28.4% versus 16.0%; 
p<0.001) and the median time to death or distant metastasis was longer with durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) than with placebo (23.2 versus 14.6 mo nths; p<0.001).  Grade 3 or 4 AEs were 
similar in both groups, occurring in 29.9% of the patients who received durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) and 26.1% of those who received placebo.
The PACIFIC Study  data l ed to the approval  of durvalumab (MEDI4736) by  [CONTACT_72932]  [ADDRESS_78998] of care for patients with unresectable Stage III 
NSCLC is now ant icipated to be cCRT fo llowed by  [CONTACT_38219] (MEDI4736).
A significant proportion of pat ients are unable to receive cCRT for a number of reasons, 
including lack of immediate acce ss to radi ation therapy  facilities or poor PS.  As s uch, m any 
patients receive sCRT and this study  aims to assess the clinical profile o f durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) therapy fo llowing sCRT in patients with WHO/ECOG PS 0 to 1 and 
WHO/ECOG PS 2.
Clinical Study Protocol -4.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) , D4194C00006
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25of 1592.1 Study rationale
Prior to the PACIFIC Study , minimal  advances had been m ade f or the treatm ent of  patients 
with unresectable Stage III NSCLC.  The treatment of cho ice in pat ients with unresectable 
stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC has been cCRT ( Postmus et al 2 017, NCCN 2018 ).  If cCRT is 
not feasible, including in frail pat ients who are unable to tolerate cC RT, sequential 
chemotherapy fo llowed by  [CONTACT_72933]  (sCRT) represents an alternat ive 
(NCCN 2018 ).  Overall, around 15% of the patients with unresecta ble Stage IIIA or Stage IIIB 
disease receive sCRT in the US and these numbers might be higher in Europe.  Compared to 
sCRT, cCRT leads to better survival by [CONTACT_72934] , but cCRT does not reduce 
the risk of distant relapse (Aupérin et al 2010) .  A pooled analysis o f 41Phase II/III studies 
confirmed that consolidat ion chemotherapy  after cCRT does not improve survival for patients 
with Stage III locally -advanced NSCLC ( Tsujino et al 2013 ).
CRT induces init ial tumour shrinkage as aresul t of tumour cell death and may enhance 
antigen release and present ation, which in turn m ay aid in the priming of immune cells to 
recogni se and eliminate tumour cells .  
Chemotherapy  and radi otherapy  canalso up-regulate the expressio n of programmed cell death 
ligand 1 ( PD-L1)(Zhang et al 2008, Deng et al 2014, Do vedi et al 2014) due to the release of 
cytokines and other inflammatory  molecules.  These factors may confer greater sensit ivity to 
PD-1/L1 pathway  blockade.  The resul ts of the PACIFIC Study demonstrate that durvalumab 
added after definit ive CRT pr ovides clinical  benefit by  [CONTACT_72935] -inflammatory  
effects of the definit ive therapy .  
The PACIFIC Study only evaluated patients who had not progressed after complet ing cCRT.  
A significant unmet medical need still exists in patients who are not eligible for cCRT.  
Collect ion ofsafety, efficacy ,and QoL data for durvalumab (MEDI4736) as consolidation 
therapy after sCRT is warranted.
2.[ADDRESS_78999] used cisplat in-based sy stemic therapy  regimens 
(Aupérin et al 2006, No n-small Cell  Lung Cancer Collaborative Group 1995 ).  cCRT has been 
found to be m ore beneficial than sCRT (Fournel et al 2005, Curran et al 201 1, Aupérin et al 
2010 ).  In the Stage III unresectable setting, a combinat ion of systemic therapy and 
radiotherapy  is usually administered.  CALGB 8433 showed an improvement of survival o f 
CRT over radiotherapy  alone for these pati ents ( Dillman et al 1996 ) .  Addi tionally, the West 
Japan Lung Cancer Group has shown that concurrent cisplat in-based chemotherapy  was 
superi or to sCRT in Stage III patients ( Furuse et al 1999).  In the Radiat ion Therapy Oncology

and III NSCLC patients ( Curran et al 201 1), showing that concurrent delivery  of 
cisplatin -based chemotherapy  with thoraci c radi otherapy confers a l ong-term survival  benefi t 
compared wi th the se quent ial delivery  of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Two important meta -analys es have 
demonstrated that adding sequential or concomitant chemotherapy  to radi cal radiotherapy  
improved survival in locally -advanced NSCLC.  The HR for survival wit h the addit ion of

Cancer Collaborative Group 1995 ) and the HR with the addit ion of platinum -based 
concomitant chemotherapy  to radi otherapy  was 0.89 (95% CI :0.81,0.98) ( Aupérin et al 
2006 ); however, these data should be interpreted wit h caution since there was so me 
heterogeneit y between the studies as well as in different sensit ivity analyses.  The NSCLC 
Collaborative Group performed a meta -analysis of 6 randomised studies , which further 
confirmed the benefit in OS of cCRT compared to sequent ial therapy ( Aupérin et al 2010 ) 
(HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.95; p=0.004), mainly due to a better locoregional control, but at 
the cost of an increased acute oesophageal toxicity.  No differ ences were observed between 
cCRT and sCRT for PFS (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.01; p=0.07).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_72896] , OS rem ains l ow wi th a 5-year OS of only approximately 15% ( Aupérin et al 
2010 ).  These studies indicate that cisplat in-based systemic therapy  with concurrent 
radiotherapy  is an effective means of treatment, although relapses are st ill frequent. 
While advances have been made in improving survival fro m Stage III NSCLC by  [CONTACT_72936] , evidence suggests that cCRT or sCRT do not reduce the risk of distant relapse
(Aupérin et al 2010) .  With f ewer cy cles and, in some cases, lower doses of chemotherapy 
delivered in the concurrent setting, several studies have assessed whether delivering induct ion 
or conso lidation treatment will improve survival , with discordant results.  A Phase II study  by 
[CONTACT_72937] a possible median survival benefit in pat ients treated 
with cCRT fo llowed by [CONTACT_72938] (median survival was 26 months) (Gandara et 
al 2006 ).  Similarly, a retrospective study found that consolidat ion therapy  after cCRT resul ted
in approximately 11months longer median OS than cCRT alone ( Liu et al  2015 ).  These 
findings were not corroborated by  [CONTACT_72939] (Hanna et al 2008). The study  terminated earlier than pl anned 
after an interim analysis showed no significant differences in survival  between the 2 arms; 
median survival t ime for pati ents in the docetaxel  arm versus the observat ion arm  was21.2 
versus 23.2 months.  There was a significant increase in severe toxicit iesin the docetaxel arm .  
More recent ly, a pooled analysis of 41 Phase II/III studi es confirmed that there remains no 
evidence to suggest that consolidat ion chemotherapy  after cCRT improves survival for 
patients wi th Stage III NSCLC and current guidelines continue to recommend cCRT alone for 
the treatment of inoperable Stage III NSCLC ( Bayman et al 2014 ; Tsujino et al 2013 ).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 27of 159The sequent ial/conso lidation setting post cCRT or sCRT seems to be ideal to evaluate the 
efficacy  of immunotherapy , which is aimed at boosting the abilit y of the patient ’simmune 
system  to eliminate cancer cells.  CRT often induces init ial tumour shrinkage followed by 
[CONTACT_72940] -induced growth inhibit ion.  
The init ial tumour shrinkage observed in so me patients fo llowing CRT is the result of cell 
death and tumour damage.  CRT -induced cell death can enhance the abilit y of the immune 
system  to recogni se and respond to the tumour through enhanced ant igen release and 
presentation which, in turn, aids in the priming of immune cells to recognise and eliminate 
tumour cells (Zhang et al  2008 ; Deng et al  2014 ; Dovedi  et al  2014 ).  Therefore, triggering or 
augm enting an ant igenic ant i-tumour response wi th CRT and co mbining or fo llowing this

Tumours that are poorly immunogenic or that have beco me immunosuppressive can 
potenti ally be made immunogenic through administration of pro-immunogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72897] i ncrease ant igen release fro m the cancer cell.  Potential priming agents for 
immunotherapy  agents include chemotherapy and radiotherapy .  Som e cytotoxic therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], 
such as anthracyclines or ionising radiat ion, prom ote ‘immunogenic cell death’, which 
includes the release o f ‘danger’ mo lecules from tumour cells such as calreticulin, high 
mobility group protein B1 and adenosine triphosphate.  These danger molecules polarize 
dendrit ic cells toward a pro -inflammatory phen otype and increase priming toward T helper [ADDRESS_79000] from regulatory T cells ( Vanneman and Drano ff 2012 ).  
Addit ionally , a recent Phase II study in pat ients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC or 
extensive -disease small -cell lu ng cancer investigated whether the ant i-cytotoxi c T-lymphocy te 
antigen 4 ( CTLA -4)agent i pi[INVESTIGATOR_72898] d be given safely in co mbinat ion with standard 
chemotherapy (carbo platin–pacli taxel ) as well  as whether i t woul d be optimal to i nitiate 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_72899], or after 2 cy cles of treatm ent.  The resul ts from 
this Phase II study  showed that the combinat ion was reasonably well -tolerated, and that a 
‘phased regimen’ in which immunotherapy  began after chem otherapy resul ted in substant ially 
improved PFS compared with carboplat in–pacli taxel  alone.  While this study  did not acti vely 
investigate dosing effects, the data show that the clinical effects of adm inistering 
immunotherapy  in combination wit h chemotherapy are strongly dependent on the sequencing 
of treatm ent ( Dunn et al 2004 ).
Recent ly, the results of a landmark Phase III PACIFIC Study  (Antoni a et al  2017 ) were 
reported.  The PACIFIC Study  evaluated the role of immune checkpo int blockade in 
unresectable Stage III NSCLC.  Eligible pat ients had di sease that had not y et progressed after 
at least 2 cycles of plat inum -based cCRT at a dose of 54 to 66 Gy .  A total  of 713 pati ents 
(PS0 to 1) were randomly assigned to receive an ant i-PD-L1 ant ibody ,durvalumab
(MEDI4736) , at a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight or placebo Q2W for up to 12 months.  
Clinical Study Protocol -4.0 [COMPANY_008]

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 28of 159Pre-planned interim analysis showed that the co -primary endpo int of median PFS was 
16.8 months (95% CI :13.0, 18.1) with durvalumab (MEDI4736) versus 5.6 months (95% CI : 
4.6, 7.8) with placebo (stratified HR for disease progressi on or death : 0.52; 95% CI :0.42,
0.65; p<0.001).  The response rate was higher with durvalumab (MEDI4736) than wit h 
placebo (28.4% v ersus16.0%; p<0.001), and the median durati on of  response (DoR) was 
longer (72.8% v ersus 46.8% of the patients had an ongoing response at 18 months).  The 
median time to death or distant metastasis was longer with durvalumab (MEDI4736) than wi th 
placebo (23.2 m onths v ersus14.6 months; p <0. 001).  Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 29.9% of 
the pati ents who received durvalumab (MEDI4736) and 26.1% of those who received placebo.  
Treatment -related (as assessed by [CONTACT_72943]) CTCAE AEs of Grade 3 or 4 
were reported in 57 (12.0%) patie nts receiving durvalumab and 11 (4.7%) patients receiving 
placebo (PACIFIC Study , data on file) . 
The PACIFIC Study only evaluated patients who had not progressed after complet ing cCRT, 
and therefore a significant unmet medical need st ill exists in patient s who are not eligible for 
cCRT.  Collect ion of safet y, efficacy, and QoL data for durvalumab as consolidat ion therapy  
after sCRT is warranted.
2.2.2 Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_72900], and under 
some c ircumstances, the immune system may  control  or even eliminate tumours ( Dunn et al 
2004 ). 
PD-L1 is part of a complex system of receptors and ligands that are invo lved in controlling 
Tcell act ivation.  The PD -1 receptor ( cluster of differentiation [ CD] 279) is expresse d on the 
surface of act ivated T cells ( Keir et al 2008 ).  It has 2 known ligands: PD -L1 (B7 ho molo g 1 
[B7-H1]; CD274) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 ( PD-L2) (B7 -DC; CD273 ) (Okazaki 
and Honjo 2007).  PD -1 and PD -L1/PD -L2 belo ng to a family of immune checkpoint proteins 
that act as co -inhibitory factors, which can halt or limit the devel opment of T cell response.  
When PD- L1 binds to PD -1, an inhibitory  signal  is transmitted into the T cell, which reduces 
cytokine producti on and suppresses T cell pro liferation.  Tum our cells explo it this 
immune checkpo int pathway  as a m echanism  to evade d etecti on and inhibit immune response.
PD-L1 is const itutively  expressed by  [CONTACT_72944], dendri tic cells, and macrophages ( Qin et al 
2016 ).  Im portantly, PD -L1 is commo nly over -expressed on tum our cells or on 
non-transform ed cells in the tum our microenvironment ( Pardoll 2012 ) .  PD -L1 expressed on 
the tumour cells binds to PD -[ADDRESS_79001] ivated T cells remain inhibited in the tumour microenvironment.  
The P D-1/PD -L1 pathway represents an adapt ive immune resistance mechanism that is 
exerted by  [CONTACT_72945] -tumour activit y.

Durvalumab (MEDI4736) , D4194C00006
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 29of 159The inhibitory  mechanism  described above is co -opted by  [CONTACT_72946] -L1 as a 
way of evading immune detection and eliminat ion(Qin et al 2016) .  The binding o f an 
anti-PD-L1 agent to the PD -L1 receptor inhibit s the interaction of PD -L1 wi th the PD -1 and 
CD80 receptors expressed on immune cells (Stewart et al  2015 ).  Thi s activity overco mes 
PD-L1-mediated inhibit ion of anti -tumour immunity .  While funct ional blockade of PD-L1 
resul ts in T cell react ivation, thi s mechanism o f actio n(MOA) is different from direct agonism 
of a stimulatory  receptor such as CD28.
PD-L1 is expressed in a broad range of cancers.  Based on these findings, an ant i-PD-L1 
antibody  coul d be used the rapeut ically to enhance ant i-tumour immune responses in pat ients 
with cancer.  Results of pre -clinical and clinical studies of monoclonal ant ibodies (mAbs) 
targeting the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_79002] ivity and a manageable 
safet y profile, supporting the hypothesis that an anti -PD-L1 ant ibody  coul d be used to 
therapeuti cally enhance ant i-tumour immune response in cancer patients ( Brahmer et al 2012 , 
Hirano et al  2005 , Iwai et al 2002, Okudai ra et al  2009 , Topalian e t al 2012 ,Zhang et al 2008 ) 
with responses that tend to be more pronounced in patients with tumours that express PD-L1 
(Powles et al 2014 , Rizvi et al  2015 ,Segal  et al  2015 ).  This hypothesis has been proven 
correct in a number of Phase II and III clinical studies of NSCLC, including PACIFIC
(Antoni a et al  2017 ), KN024 (Reck et al 2016) , KN042 (Mok et al 2016) , KN189 (Gandhi et 
al 2018 ), IMPower150 (Socinski et al 2018) , IMPower130 (Papadimitrakopoulou et al 2016 ), 
CM227 (Hellmann et al  2018 ) and others .
In contrast, CTLA -4 is consti tutively expressed by [CONTACT_30962]  T cell s and upregul ated on 
activated T cell s.  CTLA -4 delivers a negative regulatory  signal to T cell s upon binding of 
CD80 (B7.1) or CD86 (B7.2) ligands on ant igen-present ing cells (Fife and Bluestone 2008).  
Blockade of CTLA -4 binding to CD80/86 by  [CONTACT_14181]-CTLA -4 ant ibodies results in markedly  
enhanced T cell activation and ant i-tumour activit y in animal models, including killing of 
established murine so lid tumours and induction of protective anti -tumour immuni ty.  
Therefore, it is expected that treatment with an ant i-CTLA -4 ant ibody  will lead to increased 
activat ion of the human immune system, increasing anti -tumour activit y in pat ients with solid 
tumours.
Interestingly , high m utation burden ( Hellmann et al 2018 )may contribute to the responses 
seen with immune therapy  and i s beco ming a bio marker of increasing interest for potential 
predi ction of efficacy wit h immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

2.2.3 Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Durvaluma b (MEDI4736) is a human mAb of the immunogl obulin G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass 
that blocks the interaction of PD -L1 (but not programmed cell death ligand -2) wi th PD-1 on 
Tcells and CD80 (B7.1) on immune cells.  It is being developed by [CONTACT_38227]/MedImmune 
for use in the treatm ent of cancer (MedImmune is a who lly owned subsidiary of [COMPANY_008]; 
[COMPANY_008]/MedImmune is referred to as [COMPANY_008] throughout this document).  The 
proposed MOA for durvalumab (MEDI4736) is interference in the interaction of PD -L1with 
PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1).  Blockade of PD- L1/PD -1 and PD -L1/CD80 interactions releases the 
inhibit ion of immune responses, including those that may result in tumour eliminat ion.  In 
vitrostudies demonstrate that durvalumab (MEDI4736) antagonizes the inhibitory  effect of 
PD-L1 on primary  human T cell s resul ting in the restored proliferat ion of interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ)(Stewart et al 2015 ).  In vivo studies have shown that durvalumab (MEDI4736) 
inhibits tumour growth in xenograft models via a Tcell-dependent m echanism ( Stewart et al 
2015 ).  Based on these data, durvalumab (MEDI4736) is expected to stimulate the patient’s 
anti-tumour immune response by [CONTACT_28738] -L1 and shift ing the balance toward an 
anti-tumour response.  Durval umab (MEDI4736) has been engineered to reduce 
antibody -dependent cellular cy totoxi city and com plement -dependent cy totoxici ty. 
To date, durvalumab (MEDI4736) has been given to more than 6000 patients as part of 
ongoing studies eit her as monotherapy  or in combin ation with other anti cancer agents.  Details 
on the safety  profile of durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy  are summarized in 
Secti on4.3.1 and Section 8.3.12 .  Refer to the current durvalumab (MEDI4736) IB for a 
complete summary  of pre-clinical and clinical info rmation including safet y, efficacy , and 
pharmacokin etics (PK). 
2.3 Benefit/risk assessment
The m ajority of the safet y and efficacy data currently  available for durval umab (MEDI4736) 
are based on the first -in-human, single -agent study (Study  1108) in pat ients with advanced 
solid tumo urs, the study  of durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy  in NSCLC (Study  
D4191C00003 [ATLANTIC]), and the study  of durvalumab (MEDI4736) m onotherapy  in 
NSCLC fo llowing com pletion of  platinum -based chemotherapy  concurrent wi th radiation 
therapy  (PACIFIC Study ).  Data from these studies have demo nstrated clinical activit y of 
durvalumab (MEDI4736) therapy  in pat ients with NSCLC.  Details pertaining to Study  1108 
and ATLANTIC are provided in the current durvalum ab (MEDI4736) IB.

2.3.1 Potential benefits
The efficacy of durvalumab (MEDI4736) was evaluated in the PACIFIC Study , a 
multi-centre, randomised, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled study  in pat ients with unresectable 
Stage III NSCLC who completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent plat inum -based chemotherapy 
and definit ive radiation wit hin 42days pri or to ini tiation of the study  drug and had a 
WHO PS0 or 1(Antonia et al  2017 ). A total of 713 patients were randomised 2:1 to receive 
durvalumab (MEDI4736) 10mg/kg or placebo intravenously every [ADDRESS_79004] 1.1 -defined progression.  The 
pre-specified interim PFS analysis based on 81% of total planned events demonstrated a 
statist ically significant improvement in PFS of 16.8 months (95% CI :13.0, 18.1) with 
durvalumab (MEDI4736) versus 5.6 months (95% CI :4.6,7.8) with placeb o (stratified HR :
0.52; 95% CI:0.42,0.65; p <0.001).  The PFS benefit in favour of durvalumab was observed 
irrespect ive of PD -L1 expressio n before CRT (PD-L1 expressio n <25%, HR: 0.59; 95% CI:
0.43, 0.82 ; PD-L1 expressio n ≥25%, HR: 0.41; 95% CI:0.26, 0.65 ).  The response rate was 
higher with durvalumab (MEDI4736) than wit h placebo (28.4% v ersus16.0%; p<0.001), and 
the median DoR was longer (72.8% v ersus46.8% of the patients had an ongoing response at 
18 m onths).  The m edian time to death or distant metastasis was longer with durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) than with placebo (23.2 months versus14.6 months; HR: 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39, 
0.69; p <0.001). The OS data wer e immature at the time of the interim analysis o f the PFS, as 
the number of events required for the planned first OS interim analysis had not been reached 
at the time of this PFS analysis.
2.3.[ADDRESS_79005] adverse drug reactions seen wit h the immune checkpo int inhibitor class of agents are 
thought to be due to the effects of inflammatory  cells on specific t issues.  These risks are 
generally events with a potential inflammatory  or immune -mediated mechanism and that may 
requi re more frequent m onitoring and/or unique intervent ions such as immunosuppressants 
and/or endocrine therapy .  These immune -mediated effects can occur in nearly any organ 
system , and are m ost comm only seen as gastrointestinal (GI) AEs such as colit is and 
diarrhoea, pneumo nitis/interst itial lung disease (ILD), hepatic AEs such as liver enzyme

In the PACIFIC Study  (Antoni a et al  2017 ) , treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs )
occurred in 67.8% of patients in the durvalumab (MEDI4736) group compar ed to 53.4% i n

was pneumo nia, which occurred in 4.4% of pat ients who received du rvalumab (MEDI4736) 
and in 3.8% of patients in the placebo group.  Pneumo nitis or radiation pneumo nitis of any 
grade occurred in 33.9% and 24.8% of patients who received durvalumab (MEDI4736) and 
placebo, respectively; pneumonit is or radi ation pneumonit is of Grade 3 or 4 occurred in 3.4%

durvalumab (MEDI4736) and placebo were pneumonit is or radiation pneumo nitis (in 6.3% 
and 4.3% of patients, respectively) and pneumo nia(in 1.1% and 1.3% of pat ients, 
respectively ).  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) of any grade were reported in 66.1% 
of patients in the durvalumab (MEDI4736) group and in 48.7% of pat ients in the placebo 
group; events of Grade 3 or higher were le ss than 10% in both groups.  The most frequent 
AESIs of any grade with durvalumab (MEDI4736) versus placebo were diarrhoea (18.3% and 
18.8%), pneumonit is (12.6% and 7.7%), rash (12.2% and 7.3%), and pruritus (12.2% and 
4.7%).  Finally, the rate of imAEs wa s 24.2% wi th durval umab (MEDI4736) and 8.1% with 
placebo.  The rates of severe imAEs , and of pneumoni tisin part icular, were not significantly 
different (any  Grade 3 or 4 immune -mediated event 3.4% and 2.6%, and Grade 3 or 4 
pneumo nitis 1.7% and 2.6%, for durvalumab and placebo, respectively).  Overall, the safet y 
profile of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in this populatio n was consistent with that of other 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_72901] y profile as m onotherapy  with NSCLC.
In monotherapy  clinical  studi es, AEs at an incidence of >20% include events such as fat igue
anddecreased appetite.  Approximately 10% of  patients di scont inued the drug due to an AE.

screening procedures and should be performed within 42days after the end of sCRT and 28days before the start of 
study  drug.  For patients who are recovering from toxicities associated with prior treatment, IP treatment initiation may 
be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 42days from the end of the sCRT .

than the next regularly scheduled imaging visit, and this scan is evaluated using the Confirmation of Radiological 
Progression Criteria outlined in Appendix F.  If the subsequent scan does not confirm the immediate prior radiological 
PD, then the patient may continue on study drug at the discretion of the Investigator and if the patient has consented to 
do so; imaging assessments should continue until the next RECIST 1.1-defined radiological PD, which in turn will 
require a subsequent scan evaluated using the Confirmation of Radiolo gical Progression Criteria outlined in
Appendix F.  For all patients who are treated through progression, the Investigator should ensure patients do not have 
any significant, unacceptable ,or irreversible toxicities that indicate continuing treatment will not further benefit the 
patient.  The patient must continue to meet those inclusion and exclusion criteria that are relevant to treatment through 
disease progression as specified in Section 6.1.3 .  Patients with rapid tumour progression or with symptomatic 
progression that requires urgent med ical intervention (eg, central nervous system metastasis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_72903], spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]) will not be eligible to continue to receive study drug.

Table 1including tumou r assessments q8w (relative to the date of IP treatment initiation) until the study drug is 
stopped.  Patients who continue to receive treatment after the DCO should receive tumour assessment scans and other 
assessments as per local clinical practice.  It is recommended that the patients continue the scheduled site visits and 
Investigators monitor the patient’s safety laboratory assessments prior to and periodically during the treatment with 
durvalumab (MEDI4736) in order to manage AEs in accordance with the durvalumab (MEDI4736) toxicity

4.2 Scientific rationale for study design 
4.2.1 Rationale for study safety endpoints
This study  is designed to further evaluate the safety o f durvalumab (MEDI4736) 
monotherapy , using a fixed -dosing regimen , in unresectable Stage III NSCLC patients who 
have not progressed fo llowing definit ive, pl atinum -based sCRT.  Thi s study  is designed to 
complement and expand the safet y database from the ongoing Phase III PACIFIC Study .  As 
the PACIFIC Study  evaluated a weight-based dosing regimen (mg/kg) for durval umab 
(MEDI4736) , expanding data on the safet y profile of the fixed -dose combinat ion is warranted, 
particularly for m ore severe AEs, and in the context of the very  recent concept of immune 
checkpoint blockade as consolidation therapy  in unresectable Stage III NSCLC patients who 
have undergone sCRT.  Given the potential for radiotherapy  to increase the likelihood of 
anti-PD-L1–mediated pneumonit is, a need for additional safet y data on the use of durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) under this context exists, including in the sub -popul ationsof WHO/ECOG PS 
0to [ADDRESS_79017] not been representatively  included in pi[INVESTIGATOR_72905].  
In the PACIFIC Study ,the majority of imAEs with durvalumab (MEDI4736) occurred during 
the first 6 months of treatment ( see the current versio n of the durvalumab [MEDI4736] IB ).  
This timing is consist ent wi th published literature using ant i-PD-[ADDRESS_79018] of  the imAEs occur within 3 to 6 months of the init iation of 
treatm ent(Topalian et al 2014 , Weber et al 2017). The PACIFIC 6 S tudy will assess the 
safet y of durvalumab (MEDI4736) within the f irst 6 m onths of treatm ent as defined by [CONTACT_27891] 
3 and Grade 4 TRAE s, including the evaluation o f the nature of toxicit ies (SAEs, AEs, AESIs, 
imAE s), intervent ionsand treatm ent, and outcome of treatment .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 40of 1594.2.2 Rationale for study efficacy endpoints
The secondar y aim of this study  is to determine the efficacy o f durvalumab (MEDI4736) 
1500 mg q4w in terms of PFS and OS.  PFS has been found to be correlated with OS in 
previous CRT studi es (Mauguen et al 2013).  Although the OS benefit has exceed edthe PFS 
benefit in other studies of immune checkpo int inhibitors in advanced -stage NSCLC ( Borghae i 
et al 2015 ), there are certain settings in which the utilit y of survival as an endpo int may 
potenti ally be confounded by [CONTACT_70124][INVESTIGATOR_014].  Specifically, there are currently  a number 
of molecules targeting the PD -1/PD-L1 pathway in late -stage development for the treatment 
offirst-, second -,and/orthird-line metastatic NSCLC.  It is ant icipated that these agents may 
be approved or beco me available for use through expanded -access m echanisms or addi tional 
clinical st udies while the PACIFIC [ADDRESS_79019] -radiat ion changes ,tumour assessment may  be 
difficult and may need to be repeated over time to reach a clear determinat ion regarding 
responses and PD (see Secti on8.1).  The tumour -based efficacy analyses will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_72955] 1.[ADDRESS_79020] igators ’ tumour data from all scans based upon

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 41of [ADDRESS_79021] igator determinat ion that the patient is no longer benefitt ing from treatm ent wi th IP, or 
until another discont inuat ion criterion is met (see Section 7.1).  Thi s guidance is supported by  
[CONTACT_72956] -153 S tudy that indicated that patients treated with nivo lumab (an 
anti-PD-1 agent) until PD showed superior PFS when co mpared to treatment with nivo lumab 
with a 1-year fixed duration (HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.76), a tr end toward improved OS, and 
no new safet y signals after 1 y ear of treatm ent (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_70048] 2017) .  In the PACIFIC Study,
although patients were treated for up to 12 mo nths with durvalumab (MEDI4736), no new 
safet y signals were observed after 6 months of treatment.  Numerous Phase 3 studies are 
currently evaluat ing durvalumab (MEDI4736) treatment until PD for patients with a variet y of 
malignancies; while the results of these studi es are not y et available, no new safet y signals 
have been ident ified as a result of the longer duration.  The 12- monthand 18 -monthPFS rates
following durvalumab (MEDI4736) treatment in Stage III NSCLC patients in the PACIFIC 
Study  were 55.9% ( 95% CI :51.0,60.4) and44.2% (95% CI:37.7,50.5), respectively , 
suggest ing that a significant number of patients had to discont inue therapy prior to disease 
progression based on the 12 -month treatment regimen . Based on these observat ions, no new 
safet y signals are expected bey ond 1 y ear of treatment with durvalumab, but there exists the 
potenti al for addi tional clinical and survival  benefit bey ond 1year of treatment.   In order to 
balance the patient burden associated with mo nthly visits until disease progressi on wi th the 
potenti al for addi tional clinical benefit with prolonged treatment duration, durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) will be administered for a maximum of 24 months in this study .
4.2.5 Timing of treatment with durvalumab (MEDI4736) relative to 
sequential chemoradiation therapy
Non-clinical data show that both chemotherapy  and i onising radi ation up-regul ate PD -L1 
expressio n (Deng et al 2014, Zhang et al 2008 ).  In addi tion, chem otherapy  and radi otherapy  
both release new antigens leaving the cancer to act as an in situ vaccine th at can elicit 
tumour-specific T cells.  Thus, starting du rvalumab (MEDI4736) as close as possible to the 
completion of the sCRT ,when ant igen release and PD -L1 expression are most likely  to be at 
their maximum, will hopefully resul t in the m ost optimal  benefi t.  The timing for durvalumab 
(MEDI4736 ) treatment init iation will be consistent withthePACIFIC Study , i.
e., 42 days after 
the end of CRT .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 42of 1594.3 Justification for dose
This study  will utilise a fixed dose for durvalumab (MEDI4736) treatment (1500 mg q4w IV).  
Based on an average body  weight of  75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg of durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) q4w is equivalent to a weight -based dose of 20mg/kg q4w. 
4.3.1 Durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy dose rationale
A durvalumab (MEDI4736) dose of 20 mg/kg q4w is supported by  [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-vitro data, non -clinical 
activit y,clinical PK/pharmacodynamics (PDx) , biom arkers, and act ivity data f rom Study 1108 
in patients with advanced so lid tumours and fro m a Phase I study  performed in Japanese 
patients wi th advanced so lid tumour (D4190C00002).
Pharmacokinetics /pharmacodynamics data
Based on available PK/PDx data from  the ongoing Study  1108 wi th doses ranging from  0.1 to 
10 mg/kg q2w or 15 mg/kg q3w, durvalumab (MEDI4736) exhibited non -linear 
(dose -dependent) PK consistent with target -mediated drug disposit ion.  The PK approached 
linearit y at ≥3 mg/kg q2w, suggest ing near complete target saturation (membrane -bound and 
sPD-L1), and further shows that the durvalumab (MEDI4736) dosing frequency can be 
adapted to a particular regimen given the linearit y seen at doses higher than 3 mg/kg.  The 
expected half -life with doses ≥3 m g/kg q2w is approximately  21 days.  A dose -dependent 
suppressio n in peripheral sPD -L1 was observed over the dose range studied, con sistent with 
engagement of durvalumab (MEDI4736) with PD- L1.  A l ow level of immunogenicit y has 
been observed.  No patients have experienced immune -complex disease fo llowing exposure to 
durvalumab (MEDI4736) .  (For f urther inform ation on immunogenicit y, please see the current 
durvalumab [MEDI4736] IB.)
Data from Study D4190C00006 ( hereafter referred to as Study  006), a Phase I study  in 
NSCLC pat ients using the combinat ion of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab also 
show an approximately dose -proporti onal increase in PK exposure for durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) over the dose range of 3 to 20mg/kg durvalumab (MEDI4736) q4w or q2w.  
(For further informat ion on PK observat ions in Study  006, please see the current durvalumab 
[MEDI4736] IB.)The observed durvalumab (MEDI4736) PK data from the combinat ion 
Study 006 were well in line wit h the predicted monotherapy  PK data (5thmedian and 95th
percent iles) for a q4w regimen. 
A population PK model was developed using the data from Study 1108 (doses=0.1 to 
10mg/kg q2w o r 15 mg/kg q3w )(Fairman et al 2014).  Mult iple simulat ions indicate that a 
similar overall exposure is expected fo llowing both 10 mg/kg q2w and 20 mg/kg q4w 
regimens, as represented by [CONTACT_72957] -time curve at steady state 
(AUC ss; 4weeks).  Median maximum drug concentration at steady  state (C max,ss) is expected 
to be higher with 20 mg/kg q4w (~1.5 fold) and median trough pl asma concentration 
Clinical Study Protocol -4.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) , D4194C00006
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 43of 159(Ctrough,ss ) is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg q2w ( ~1.25 fold).  Clinical act ivity with the 
20mg/kg q4w dosing regimen is ant icipated to be consistent with 10 mg/kg q2w with the 
proposed similar dose of 20 mg/kg q4w expected to (a) achieve co mplete target saturation in 
majorit y of patients; (b) account fo r anticipated variabilit y in PK, PDx, and clinical act ivity in 
diverse cancer populat ions; (c) maintain sufficient PK exposure in case of anti -drug ant ibody  
impact; and (d) achieve PK exposure that yielded maximal anti -tumour activit y in animal 
models.
Given the similar area under the plasma concentratio n versus time curve ( AUC )and modest 
differences in median peak and trough levels at steady  state, the observat ion that both 
regimens maintain co mplete sPD -L1 suppressio n at trough, and based on the availabl e clinical 
data, the 20 mg/kg q4w and 10 mg/kg q2w regimens are expected to have similar efficacy and 
safet y profiles, supporti ng further development with a dose of 20 mg/kg q4w. 
Clinical data
Refer to the current durvalumab (MEDI4736) IB for a complete summary o f clinical 
inform ation including safet y, efficacy, and PK at the 20 mg/kg q4w regimen.
4.3.2 Rationale for fixed dosing
A population PK model was developed for durvalumab (MEDI4736) using m onotherapy  data 
from Study 1108 and the PACIFIC Study (n=1310, d oses including 10 mg/kg q2w or 
15 mg/kg q3w or 20 mg/kg q4w; so lid tumours) .  Popul ation PK analysis indicated only minor 
impact of body  weighton the PK of durvalumab (MEDI4736) (coefficient of ≤0.5).  The 
impact of body  weight-based (10 mg/kg q2w or 20 m g/kg q4w) and fixed dosing (750 mg 
q2w or 1500 mg q4w) of durvalumab (MEDI4736) was evaluated by [CONTACT_72958] (AUC ss,0-28days , Cmax,ss, and C min,ss) using the population PK model.  
A fixed dose of 750 mg was selected to appr oximate 10 mg/kg and a fixed dose of 1500 mg 
q4w was selected to approximate 20 mg/kg q4w (based on median body weight of ~75 kg).  A 
total of 1000 patients were simulated using body  weightdistribut ion of 40 to 120 kg.  
Simulation results demo nstrate that body weight -based (10 mg/kg q2w) and fixed dosing 
(750 mg q2w) regimens yield similar median steady state PK exposures and associated 
variabilit y, supporting the potential switch of durvalumab (MEDI4736) from weight -based to 
fixed dose.  Similar considera tions hol d for the q4w dosing regimens (20 mg/kg q4w versus 
1500 mg q4w).
Similar findings have been reported by  [CONTACT_2312] ( Narwal  et al  2013 , Ng et al 2006, Wang 
et al 2009 , Zhang et al 2012).  Wang and colleagues invest igated 12 mAbs and found that 
fixed and body  size-based dosing perform similarly, wit h fixed dosing being better for 7 of 
12antibodies ( Wang et al2009 ).  In addit ion, they  investi gated 18 therapeutic proteins and 
pepti des and showed that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing the 
between -patient variabilit y in PK/ PDx param eters ( Zhang et al 2012 ) . 
Clinical Study Protocol -4.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) , D4194C00006
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 44of 159A fixed dosing approach is preferred by [CONTACT_72959] y due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors.  Given expectation of similar PK exposure and variabilit y, it was 
considered feasible to switch to fixed -dosing regimens.  Based on average body weight of 
75kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg q4w durvalumab (MEDI4736) (equivalent to 20 mg/kg q4w) 
is included in the PACIFIC [ADDRESS_79022] cCRT.  
In addit ion, non- clinical data shows that both c hemotherapy and io nising radiat ion up-regul ate 
PD-L1 expression ( Deng et al  2014 , Zhang et al 2008 ).  Therefore, PD -L1 expressio n from a 
biopsy sample prior to sCRT may not accurately reflect the state of disease at the time the 
patient enrols in this study .  In addi tion, tum ours that are poorly immunogenic or that have 
beco me immunosuppressive can likely be made immunogenic through administration o f 
pro-immunogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72906] m the cancer cell.  
Therefore, as stated, inclusio n in this study is not res tricted based on PD -L1 expressio n from 
any available tissue samples.  If it is feasib le, biopsies will be taken post CRT.  If possible 
based on the number and viabilit y of the samples collected ,it will be retrospecti vely assess ed
whether there is any corr elation between PD -L1 expressio n and response to treatment.  
Current experience with single -agent immunotherapy  studi es suggests that clinical responses 
may be restricted to a subset of any  given pat ient populat ion and that it might be beneficial to 
enric h the patient population by [CONTACT_72960].  At the time of 
the init ial wri ting of this protocol, no assay has been established/validated and no single 
approach has proven accurate for Stage III NSCLC patient enrichment for immune -mediated 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014].  However, independent data from mult iple sources using different assays and 
scoring methods suggests that PD -L1 expression on tumour cells and or tumour -infiltrating 
cells may be associated with greater clinical benefit.  For ex ample, data presented by  [CONTACT_72961]3280A suggest that PD -L1 expressio n on infiltrating lymphocy tes in NSCLC, 
melano ma, and renal cell carcino ma pat ient cohorts is associated with greater clinical benefit 
from anti-PD-L1 treatm ent(Powderly et al 2013) .  Using a proprietary  assay for PD -L1

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 45of 159immunohistochemistry , the authors found a 36% ORR in PD -L1-positive pati ents wi th 50% of  
patients who were PD -L1-posit ive having SD and 33% having a PR.  In contrast, in PD -L1 
negat ive pat ients, they  found only  a 13% ORR wi th 28% of  patients having SD and 13% 
having a PR.  Importantly, a significant portion of patients (17%) that were negative for 
PD-L1 were able to respond to MPDL 3280A treatment.
Similarly, in data presented by  [CONTACT_414] -Myers Squibb, PD-L1 staining assessed using a 
different method and scoring algorithm appeared to be associated with greater clinical benefit 
in patients treated with nivo lumab (ant i-PD-1)(Grosso et al 2013 ).  The authors found a 44% 
ORR in PD -L1-positive patients versus a 17% ORR in PD -L1-negat ive pat ients.  
Addit ionally , in their studies, PD -L1-positive pat ients had a higher PFS (9.1 months versus 
2.0months) and OS (21 months versus 12 months)than PD-L1-negat ive pat ients.
Therefore, while it appears that PD -L1 expressio n may improve the probabilit y and/or qualit y 
of response to PD -[ADDRESS_79023] ive of PD -L1 status ; furthermore, it will be difficult to ob tain post -sCRT biopsies

Patients who are receiving treatment at the time of final DCO m ay cont inue receiving IP if the 
Invest igator judges that they  are gaining clinical benefit.
All patients will receive scans and fo llow-up care in accordance wit h standard local clinical 
practi ce.  All  data will  be recorded on pati ent charts but will not otherwise be reported for the 
purposes of this study .
For pati ents who do continue to receive IP beyo nd the time o f the final DCO, Inves tigators 
will report SAEs to [COMPANY_008] Pat ient Safet y via paper case report forms (CRFs) unt il 
90days after the l ast dose of study  drug, in accordance with Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_79049] ice and in alignment with the Dosing Modification and 
Toxicit y Management Guidelines ( Secti on8.4.5 ),unless the event is considered by  [CONTACT_72968], or the patient is lost to fo llow-up . Data will not be 
captured for the purposes of this study  outsi de of being recorded in the patients’ source 
docum ents.
Following the DCO, SAE reporting applies only  to pati ents who are active on IP and within 
90days after the l ast dose; in all other cases , only  a Statem ent of Death notificat ion is to be 
sent to [COMPANY_008].
Different drug supply options will be available depending on the country, and these will be 
proposed to the patient when the most appropriate alternat ives for continued treatment have 
been agreed between AZ and the investigator.  Optio ns may include the participat ion in a new 
rollover study  or, if the study  drug has been locally approved for use in this disease indicat ion, 
patients m ay be discont inued and switched to the marketed product , in accordance wit h local 
laws.
In the event that a rollover or safet y extensio n study  is available at the end of 24 months of

The Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all IP is 
stored in a secured area, at refrigerated temperatures (2°C to 8°C) and in accordance wit h 
applicable regulatory  requi rements. A temperature log will be used to record the temperature 
of the storage area. Temperature excursions outside the permissible range listed in the clinical 
supply packaging are to be reported to the monitor upon detection. A calibrated temperature 
monitoring device will be used to record the temperature condit ions in the drug storage 
facilit y.Storage condit ions stated in the IB may  be superseded by [CONTACT_4671].

6.4.2 Durvalumab (MEDI4736) drug -drug interactions
There i s no information to date on drug- drug interactions wit h durvalumab (MEDI4736) either 
pre-clinically or in patients.  As durvalumab (MEDI4736) is anmAb and therefore a protein, it 
will be degraded to small pept ides and amino acids and will be eliminated by [CONTACT_72974].  It is therefore not expected that durvalumab (MEDI4736) will 
induce or inhibit the major drug metabo lizing cy tochrom e P450 pathways.  As a result, there 
are no expected PK drug -drug interactions.  The MOA of durvalumab (MEDI4736) involves 
binding to PD -L1, and therefore significant PDx drug interactions with the commo nly 
administered concomitant medications are not expected.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], appropri ate clinical 
monitoring in all of the planned clinical studies will be conducted to evaluate any  potenti al 
drug-drug interactions.

for discont inuat ion and the presence of any AE. The pat ient shoul d continue attending 
subsequent study  visits, and data collect ion should continue according to the study  protocol .
If the patient does not agree to continue in- person study  visits, a m odified foll ow-up m ust be 
arranged to ensure the collection o f endpo ints and safet y informat ion.This follow-up coul d 
be a telephone contact [CONTACT_10970], a contact [CONTACT_57999] h a rel ative or treating physician, or 
inform ation from medical records. The approach taken should be recorded in the medical 
records. A patient who agrees to modified fo llow-up is not considered to have withdrawn 
consent or to have withdrawn fro m the study .
Patients who are perm anent ly discont inued from further receipt of IP, regardless of the reason, 
will be ident ified as having permanent ly discontinued treatment. Patients who are 
permanent ly discont inued will enter fo llow-up assessment swith schedule relative to t he date

7.[ADDRESS_79060] has been established by [CONTACT_72977] (see Section 4.4), such that there is insufficient information to 
determine the patient’s survival  status at that time.  Patients who refuse to continue 
participat ion in the study , incl uding tel ephone contact, shoul d be docum ented as “wit hdrawal 
of consent” rather than “lo st to fo llow-up.”  Investigators should document attempts to 
re-establish contact [CONTACT_72978].  If  contact [CONTACT_29881] a 
missi ng pati ent is re -established, the patient should not be considered potentially lost to 
follow-up, and evaluat ions should resume according to the protocol.
In order to support the analysis o f the secondary  endpoints of PFS and OS, the survival status 
of allenrolled patients should be re -checked; this includes those patients who withdrew 
consent or are classified as “potentially lost to follow -up.”
Potenti ally lost to f ollow-up: S ite personnel should check hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], the patients’ 
current phy sician, a nd a publicly available death registry  (if available) to obtain a current 
survival status.  (The applicable eCRF modules will be updated.)
In the event that the patient has actively wit hdrawn consent to the processing o f their 
personal data, the survival s tatus of the patient can be obtained by [CONTACT_72979] (if available) where it is possible to do so under 
applicable local laws to obtain a current survival status.  (The applicab le eCRF modules 
will be updated .)
The following acti ons m ust be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study  
visit:
The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_72980].
Before a patient is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_72981], for example, repeat 
telephone calls, certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address, or local 
equivalent m ethods.  These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s 
medical record.  
Efforts to reach the patient should continue until the end of the study.  Should the patient 
be unreachable at the end of the study , the pati ent shoul d be considered to be lost to

contact.
7.3 Withdrawal from the study
Patients are free to withdraw from the study  at any time (IP and asses sments) wi thout 
prejudice to further treatment.
Patients who wi thdraw consent for further participation in the study  will not receive any  
further IP or further study  observat ion, wi th the excepti on of  follow-up for survival, which 
will cont inue unt il the e nd of the study  unless the pati ent has expressly wit hdrawn their 
consent to survival fo llow-up.  Note that the patient may be offered addit ional tests or tapering 
of treatm ent to wi thdraw safely.
A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about t he reason(s) for withdrawal and 
the presence o f any AE.  The Invest igator will fo llow up AEs outside of the clinical study. 
If a patient withdraws consent, they  will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent 
to:
All further parti cipat ion in the study  including any further fo llow-up (eg, survival contact 
[CONTACT_21646])
The use of any samples (see Appendix C).
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in Table 1and  Table 2. 
AWeb-Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query  
handling.  The Invest igator will ensure that data are r ecorded on the eCRF as specified in the 
study  protocol  and in accordance with the instructions provided . 
The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, legibilit y, and timeliness of the data 
recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study  
Agreement.  The Invest igator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed 
eCRFs will be archived at the study  site.
Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awa reness to determine if the patient should continue or discontinue study drug.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in Table 1andTable 2, 
is essent ial and requi red for study conduct.
Clinical Study Protocol -4.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) , D4194C00006
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 66of 159All screening evaluat ions must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential pat ients 
meet all eligibili ty criteria.  The Investi gator will maintain a screening log to record details of 
all patients screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical management (eg, blood coun t)
and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilised for screening or baseline purposes, 
provi ded that the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed within the 
time frame defined in Table 1and Table 2and the pati ent consents to the use of these results.
8.1 Efficacy assessments
The key  efficacy  endpoints are: median PFS; proporti on of  patients progressi on-free at 
12months (PFS12) and 24 months ( PFS24 ); median OS; proporti on of  patients alive at 
12months(OS12), 24 m onths (OS24), and 36 months (OS36), respectively ; and median time 
to NSCLC -related death , from first IP dose administration ; ORR and DoR.  Efficacy  
assessments of PFS, ORR , and DoR will be derived (by  [CONTACT_38227]) using I nvest igator 
assessment s according to RECIST 1.1.  
Tumour assessments utilise images from CT (preferred) or MRI, each preferably  with IV 
contrast, of the chest and abdo men (including the ent ire liver and both adrenal glands), 
collected during screening/baseline and at regular ( follow-up) intervals during study  
treatm ent.  Any other areas of disease invo lvement should be addit ionally  imaged based on the 
signs and symptoms of individual patients.  It is important to follow the tumour assessment 
schedule as closely as possible (ref er to Table 1and Table 2).  If an unscheduled assessment is 
perform ed and the pati ent has not progressed, every  attem pt shoul d be made to perform  the 
subsequent assessments at the next scheduled visit.  Treatment con tinues for a maximum of 
24months or until disease progressi on (clinical progression/deterioration ± radio logical 
progression by  [CONTACT_393] 1.1), and scanning/tumour assessments continue throughout 
treatm ent.  An addit ional follow-up scan is requested fo llowing progressi on if clinically 
feasible.
The RECIST 1.1 guidelines ( see Appendix F) provide a m ethod of assessment of change in 
tumour burden in response to treatment .  Screening/ baseline imaging should be performed no 
more than [ADDRESS_79061] 1.1 assessments of baseline
images i dentify target l esions (TLs)(defined measurable) and non -target lesions (NTLs).  On -
study  images are evaluated for TLs and NTLs chosen at baseline and for new l esions (NLs) 
when they appear.  This allows determinat ion of follow- up TL response, NTL lesion response, 
the presence o f unequivocal NLs, and overall t imepoint responses (CR, PR, SD, PD, or not 
evaluable [NE]).

In addit ion, pati ents on treatm ent or in survival fo llow-up will be contact[CONTACT_72984].  Survival calls will be made fo llowing the date of DCO for the analysis (these 
contacts should generally occur within 7 days o f the DCO). If participants are confirmed to be 
alive or if the death date is after the DCO date, then these participants will be censored at the 
date of DCO.
8.1.2 Patient -reported outcome assessments
‘Patient-reported outcome s’is an umbrella term referring to any report of the status of a 
patient’s healt h condit ion that comes direct ly from the pati ent, wi thout interpretation of 
anyo ne else .  PROs have become a significant endpoint when evaluat ing effective ness of 
treatm ents in clin ical studies.  The fo llowing PRO questionnaires will be administered in this

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 69of 1598.1.2.4 Administration of patient -reported outcome questionnaires
Patients will  perform the PRO assessments using an electronic tablet (ePRO) during clinic 
visits and will take approximately  15minutes to complete.
Each centre must allocate the responsibilit y for the administration of the PRO instruments to a 
specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study  coordinator) and, if possible, assign a 
back-up person to cover if that individual is absen t.  The PRO questionnaires must be 
administered and completed at the clinic as per Table 1and Table 2. 
It is important that the site staff explains the value and relevance of PRO data, which is to hear 
directly from patients how they  feel.  The foll owing best practice gui delines shoul d be 
followed:
PRO questionnaires must be completed prior to treatment administration.  As feasible, 
site staff shoul d ensure PRO questionnaires are completed prior to discussio n of disease 
progression and other study  procedures, such as laboratory  samples to further avoid 
biasing the patient’s response to the q uestions.
The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is 
confident ial.  Therefore, if the pat ient has any  medical probl ems, he or she should discuss 
them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the PRO assessment .  The 
PRO questionnaires must be completed in private by [CONTACT_102].
The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind patients that there are no right or 
wrong answers and avo id int roduci ng bias by [CONTACT_72985].  The patient should not 
receive help fro m relatives, friends, or clinic staff to answer the PRO que stionnaires. The 
patientsshoul d be given sufficient time to complete the PRO que stionnai res at thei r own 
speed.
The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the patient on how to use the ePRO 
device using the materials and trainin g provi ded in t he ePRO device.
All PRO quest ionnaires are to be completed using an ePRO device. If technical or other 
issues prohibit co mpletion on the device, an appropriate back -up opti on m ay be 
considered for the study  with prior approval  and instructi on from the Sponsor.
A key  aspect of study  success i s to have high PRO compliance.  Therefore ,it is essent ial to 
follow the SoA and that sites make sure the device is charged and fully funct ional at all t imes 
in order to minimi se missing data.
As a general rule, site staff should not read or complete the PRO questionnaires on behalf o f 
the pati ent(see Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_79063] mit igation during study  disrupti ons).  If the 
patient is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that patient should be 
exempted fro m completing PRO quest ionnaires but may st ill participate in the study.
Patients exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately  by [CONTACT_72986].

8.2 Safety asse ssments 
Planned timepo ints for all  safety  assessments are provided in Table 1and Table 2. 
8.2.1 Clinical safety laboratory assessments
Blood and urine samples for determinat ion of clinical chemistry , haematol ogy, and urinalysis 
will be taken at the times indicated in the assessment schedules and as clinically indicated (see 
Table 1and Table 2).  
Clinical laboratory  safet y tests, including serum pregnancy  tests, will  be perform ed in a 
licensed clinical laboratory  according to l ocal standard procedures.  Sample tubes and sample
sizes may  vary depending on the laboratory  method used and routine practice at the site.  
Urine pregnancy  tests m ay be perform ed at the si te using a licensed test (urine or serum 
pregnancy test).  Abnormal clinically significant laboratory  resul ts shoul d be repeated as soon 
as possible (preferably  within 24 to 48 hours).
Addit ional safet y samples may  be collected if clinically indicated at the discret ion of the

parameters is routinely measured, then either lipase or amylase is acceptable.
cBicarbonate (w here available), chloride, gamma glutamyltransferase, and magnesium testing are to be 
performed at baseline, on Day 1 (unless all screening laborator y clinical chemis try assessments are 
performed within 3 days prior to Day 1), and if clinically indicated.

bulleted list below. 
BP and pulse, and other vital signs (including temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will b e 
collected before, during, and after IP infusio n at the fo llowing times (based on a 60- minute 
±10 minutes infusio n):
Prior to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from approximately 30 minutes 
before up to 0 minute [ie, the beginning of the infus ion])
Approximately  30minutes during the infusio n (halfway through infusio n) 
At the end of the infusio n (approximately 60 minutes ± 10minutes)
A 1-hour observat ion peri od is recommended after the first infusio n of IP.  If no clinically  
significant infusi on react ions are observed during or after the first cy cle, subsequent 
infusio n observat ion peri ods can be at the Invest igator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes 
after each IP infusio n). 
If the infusio n takes l onger than [ADDRESS_79065] ice or as clinicall y indicated.
Subsequent IP dose administrations
BP, pul se, and other vital signs (including temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) should be

8.3 Collection of adverse events
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study  are familiar 
with the content of this Section.
The definit ions of an AE and SAE can be found in Appendix B.
AE will be reported by  [CONTACT_25034] (or, when appropri ate, by  a caregiver, surr ogate, or the 
patient’s legally  authori sed representative). 
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, document ing, and recording 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE.  For informat ion on how to follow up AEs, 
see Section 8.3.3 . 
8.3.1 Method of detecting adverse events and serious adverse events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Ope n-ended and 
non-leading verbal quest ioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.

adverse event information 
AEs and SAEs will be co llected fro m time of si gnature of informed consent throughout the 
treatm ent peri od and including the follow -up period ([ADDRESS_79067] dose of IP). If an 
event that starts post the defined safety  follow-up peri od noted above i s considered to be due 
to a late-onset toxicity to study drug then i t shoul d be reported as an AE or SAE ,as 
applicable.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_79068] igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any  time after a pati ent’s l ast visi t 
and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study  drug or study  
participat ion, the Invest igator may notify the Sponsor.
The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, a nd assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for complet ing and transmitting SAE reports are described in Appendix B.
8.3.3 Follow- up of adverse event s and serious adverse event s
During the course of the study , all AEs and SAEs shoul d be proactively  followed up for each 
patient.  Every  effort shoul d be m ade to ob tain a resol ution for all events, even if the events 
continue after discont inuat ion or study  com pletion.
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study  are f ollowed up by  [CONTACT_72989] (this may be beyo nd the [ADDRESS_79069] 
dose of IP), but without further recording in the eCRF. Any S AE or non -serious AE ongoing 
at the time of the DCO is to be fo llowed up at the discretion of the Investigator and per local 
practi ce and in alignment with the Dosing Modification and Toxicit y Management Guidelines
(Secti on8.4.5 ), unless the event is considered by [CONTACT_72990] f ollow-up.  [COMPANY_008] retains the right to request addit ional inform ation 
for any  patient wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
8.3.4 Adverse event data collection
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE:
AE (verbat im)
The date when the AE started and stopped
The m aximum  CTCAE Grade reported

Invest igator causalit y rating against the I Ps (yes or no)
Action taken with regard to I Ps

Outcom e
In addition, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
Date the AE met criteria for SAE
Date the Invest igator became aware of the SAE
Seriousness criteria fulfilled
Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913]
Date of discharge
Probable cause of death
Date of death
Whet her an autopsy  was perform ed
Causalit y assessment in relat ion to study  procedure(s)
Causalit y assessment in relat ion to other medicat ion, as explained in Section 8.3.5
Descript ion of the SAE
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE versio n 4.03 will be ut ilised for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, 
the recommendat ion in the CTCAE cri teria that converts mild, moderate, and severe events 
into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy  of the CTCAE versio n 4.03 can be downloaded 
from the Cancer Therapy  Evaluat ion Program websi te (http://ctep.cancer.gov ).
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_72991] a in Appendix B, B 2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B, B 2.  On th e other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke, but it would be an SAE if it sat isfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix B, B 2.

The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between IP and each AE, and answer “yes” or 
“no” to the question “Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable possibilit y that the event m ay 
have been caused by [CONTACT_33159]?”
For SAEs, causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures .  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any  study  procedure, the causal relat ionship 
is implied as “yes”.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix B, B 7.
8.3.6 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_72992], “Have you had any healt h probl ems since the previous visit/y ou were 
last asked?” , or revealed by [CONTACT_72993] d in the eCRF.  When 
collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, th e diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
8.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from the protocol -mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in 
the CSR.  Deterioration as co mpared to baseline i n protocol -mandated laboratory  values and 
vital signs shoul d therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are 
the reason for discont inuat ion of treatment with an IP. 
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s assoc iated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.  Wherever possible, the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather th an the laboratory  term  (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglo bin value).  
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in 
non-mandated parameters should be reported as AEs.
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value that i s unequivoc ally due to disease progression should not 
be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related to the disease under study , see Secti ons8.3.9 and 8.3.10 .

Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condit ion attributable to 
the disease for which the IP is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severit y of the 
disease under study  and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new

AESI may  be seri ous or non -serious.  The rapi d reporti ng of AESIs allows ongoing 
surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in associat ion with 
the use of this IP.
AESIs for durvalumab (MEDI4736) include but are not limited to events with a potential 
inflammatory or immune -mediated m echanism  and which m ay requi re more f requent 
monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants, and/o r hormone 
replacement therapy .  These AESIs are being closely  monitored in clinical  studi es wi th 
durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy  and co mbinat ion therapy .  An imAE is defined as an 
AESI that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immun e-mediated MOA 
and where there is no clear alternate aetio logy.  Serol ogic, immuno logic, and histol ogic 
(biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE diagnosis.  Appropriate 
efforts should be made to rule out neoplast ic, infectious, meta bolic, toxin, or other etiologic 
causes o f the imAE. 
If the Investigator has any quest ions wit h regard to an event being an imAE, the Invest igator 
shoul d prom ptly contact [CONTACT_33139].  AESIs may have addit ional clinical informat ion 
collected in th e eCRF.
AESI/imAEs observed with ant i PD-L/PD -1 agents such as durvalumab include pneumo nitis, 
hepat itis, diarrhea/co litis, intestinal perforation, endocrinopathies (hypo -and 
hyper -thyroidism, adrenal insufficiency , hypophysi tis/hypopi [INVESTIGATOR_72914]1diabetes

Guidelines ( Secti on8.4.5 ).  These guidelines have been prepared by [CONTACT_72994] r in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicit ies.  
These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to the IP/study  regimen by [CONTACT_72995].
8.3.13 Safety data to be collected following the final data cut-off of the study
For pati ents continuing to receive IP treatm ent after final DCO and database closure, it is 
recommended that the patients continue the scheduled site visits and Investigators monitor the 
patient’s safet y laboratory  resul ts pri or to and periodically during treatment with IP in order to 
manage AEs in accordance with the durvalumab (MEDI4736) Dosing Modificat ion and 
Toxicit y Management Guidelines (see Section 8.4.5 ). All data post the final DCO and 
database closure will be recorded in the patient notes but, with the exception of SAEs, will not 
otherwi se be reported for the purposes of this study .
All SAEs that occur in patients still receiving IP treatm ent (or wi thin the [ADDRESS_79073] dose of IP treatm ent) post the final DCO and database closure must be reported as 
detailed in Sect ion8.4.[ADDRESS_79074] to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP or to the 
study  procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Invest igators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day , ie, immediately but no later than 
24hours of when he/she becom es aware of it.
The designated AstraZen eca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary  informat ion is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safet y data entry  site within 
1calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately .  Investi gators or other site personnel inform 
[COMPANY_008] representatives of any  follow-up informat ion on a previously  reported SAE 
within 1 calendar day , ie, immediately  but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becom es 
aware of it.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 85of 159Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an autom ated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system  is unavailable, the Invest igator will contact [CONTACT_72996] . The Study  Representative will give guidance on how to send the SAE report,
eg, using a paper back -up SAE report, recognizing that the same reporting time frames st ill 
apply.
As soon as the WBDC system  is available again, the Invest igator must enter all SAE 
inform ation in the WBDC system  as well .
The Principal Invest igator is responsibl e for ensuring that procedures and expertise are 
available to handle medical emergencies during the study .  Amedical emergency usually 
constitutes an SAE and is to be reported as such.
For further guidance on the definit ion of an SAE, see Appendix B .
8.4.2 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to [COMPANY_008] except for 
pregnancy discovered before the study  patient has recei ved any  IP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Maternal exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study , the IP shoul d be discont inued 
immediately .
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n that the IP under study  
may have interfered with th e effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion.  Congenital 
abnorm alities or bi rth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  El ective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be f ollowed up and docum ented even if the pat ient 
was discont inued from the study.
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study ,then the Invest igator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day (ie, immediately but no 
later than 24 hours ) of when he or she beco mes aware of i t.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Inv estigator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 
1to5calendar days for SAEs (see Section 8.4.1 ) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.

[IP_ADDRESS] Paternal exposure 
Male patients should refrain fro m fathering a child or donating sperm during the study  and for 
90days following the l ast dose of IP.  
Pregnancy of the patient’s partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormalit y) occurring from  the date of the first dos e until [ADDRESS_79075] ob tain the consent of the patient’s partner. Therefore, the local study  
team  shoul d adopt the generic ICF template in line with local procedures and submit it to the 
relevant Independent Ethics Co mmittees (IECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to 
use.
8.4.3 Overdose
Use of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol is 
considered to be an overdose.  There is current ly no specific treatment in the event of 
overdose of durvalumab (MEDI4736) , and possible symptoms of overdose are not established. 
An overdose with assoc iated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study  drug oc curs in the course of the study , then the 
Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives 
immediately , or no later than 24 hours of when he /she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with th eInvest igator to ensure that all

The fo llowing general guidance should be fo llowed for m anagement of toxi cities:
Treat each of the toxicit ies with maximum supportive care (including ho lding the agent 
suspected of causing the toxicit y if required).
If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, considerat ion should be given to 
continuing the same dose of the assigned IP along wi th appropri ate conti nuing supportive 
care.  If medically  appropriate, dose m odificati ons are permitted. 
All dose modificat ions should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of 
the approach taken.
All toxicit ies will be graded accord ing to NCI CTCAE, versio n 4.03 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Specific toxicity management and dose modification information –
Durvalumab and durvalumab + tremelimumab
Com prehensive toxi city management guidelines (TMGs) have been developed to assist 
investigators with the recognit ion and management of toxicit ies associ ated wi th use of  the 
immune -checkpo int inhibitors, durvalumab [MED4736] (PD -L1 inhibitor) and tremelimumab 
(CTLA -4 inhibitor). Given the similar underlying mechanism o f toxicities observed wi th 
these two compounds, these TMGs are applicable to the management of patients receiving 
either drug as m onotherapy  or both drugs in combinat ion. Addit ionally, these guidelines are 
applicable when eit her drug is used alone or both drugs are used in co mbinat ion and, also 
other anti -cancer drugs (i .e., antineopl astic chem otherapy, targeted agents) are administered 
concurrent ly or sequent ially as part of a protocol -specific treatment regimen. The TMGs 
provi de inform ation for the m anagement of immune m ediated reacti ons, infusio n-related
reacti ons, and non -immune -mediated reactions that may be observed with checkpoint inhibitor 
monotherapy  or com binat ion checkpo int inhibitor regimens, with specific instructions for 
checkpoint inhibitor -specific dose modificat ions (including discont inuat ion) and treatment 
intervent ions. Invest igators are advised however to use local practice guidelines and consult 
local references for the management of toxicit ies observed wit h other ant i-cancer treatment.
The m ost current version of the TMGs is provided to the invest igative site as an Annex to 
Protocol  docum ent ent itled, “Dosing Modificat ion and Toxicit y Management Guidelines for 
Immune-Mediated, Infusio n-Related, and Non -Immune –Mediated Reactions (MEDI4736

Monotherapy ),” and is maintained within the Site Master File.
Patients shoul d be thoroughly  eval uated and appropri ate efforts should be made to rule out 
neopl astic, infecti ous, m etabo lic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the imAE. Serologic, 
immuno logic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE 
diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternat ive aetiology , events should be considered 
potenti ally immune -related. In addit ion, there are certain circu mstances in which durvalumab 
and tremelimumab should be permanent ly discont inued (see Sect ion7.1 of this protocol and 
the TMGs). Following the first dose of IP, subsequent administration o f durvalumab and 
tremelimumab can be modified based on toxicit ies observed as described in the Dosing 
Modificat ion and Toxi city Management Gui delines (see the Annex document to this CSP) . 
These guidelines have been prepared by [CONTACT_72997]/her clinical judgment in treatin g these ty pes of  toxicities. These guidelines apply to 
AEs considered causally related to durvalumab monotherapy  and the durvalumab + 
tremelimumab regimen by [CONTACT_33143].
Dose reductions are not permitted.  In case of doubt, the Invest igator should consult with 
the Study  Physician.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117of 159Appendix BAdverse event definitions and additional safety information
B [ADDRESS_79106] a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 
sign (eg, an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or 
disease tem porally associ ated w ith the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product. 
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i e, run -in, treatment, washout, 
follow-up), that fulfils1 or more of the following cri teria:
Results in death.
Is immediately life -threatening.
Requi res in -patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72916]. 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty. 
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth de fect.
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Adverse Events for malignant tumours reported during a study  shoul d generally be 
assessed as Serious AEs.  If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical 
Event’ criterion should be used.  In certain situat ions, however, medical judgement on an 
individual event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should 
be assessed and reported as a Non -Serious AE.  For example, if the tumour is included as 
medical history  and progression occurs during the study , but the progressi on does not 
change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumour, the AE may not fulfill the 
attributes for being assessed as serious, although reporting o f the progression of the 
malignant tumour as an AE is valid and should occur.  Also, some types of malignant 
tumours, whi ch do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that does not require 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], m ay be assessed as Non -Serious; examples include Stage 1 basal cell 
carcino ma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy.
In Onco logy studi es, the above instruction applies only  when the m alignant tum our event 
in quest ion is a new malignant tum our (i .e., it is not the tum our f or whi ch entry  into the 
study  is a cri terion and that is being treated by  [CONTACT_73009] ).
Malignant tumours that –as part of normal, if rare, progression –undergo transformation

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 118of 159(eg, Ri chter's transformat ion of B cell chronic lymphocy tic leukemia into diffuse large 
Bcell lympho ma) should not be considered a new malignant tumour.
B 3 Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s 
death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe fo rm it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
B 4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72917] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
B [ADDRESS_79107] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring IV hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcyste ine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913]
Development of drug dependency or drug abu se
B [ADDRESS_79108] version will be ut ilised for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, 
the recommendat ion in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, mo derate and severe events 
into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy  of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 119of 159Cancer Therapy  Evaluat ion Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  The applicable versio n 
of CTCAE shoul d be described clearly.
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_73010] B, B 2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B, B 2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix B, B 2.
B 7 A guide to interpreting the causality question
When making an assessment of causalit y,consider the fo llowing factors when deciding if 
there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE may  have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the suspect
drug?  Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the sam e 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72918]?
No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reason ably explained by [CONTACT_73011], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not norma lly recommend or support a re-
challenge .
Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the d rug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.

inform ation to m ake an informed judgment.   With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonabl e possibili ty.
B 8 Medication error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant 
or has the potential to cause h arm to the parti cipant. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error. 
Occurr ed
Was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that coul d have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error eg, m edicati on prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the participant
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water w hen it shoul d be taken as a 
solid tablet 
Drug not stored as instructed
Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS –including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed dru g dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging

and evaluation of Hy’s law
E 1 Introduction
This appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropri ately 
report cases of HL.  It i s not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of 
elevated liver biochemistries.  Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalit ies can be 
found in the Dosing Modificat ion and Toxi city Management Guidelines ( Section8.4.5 ).
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potenti al Hy’s law (PHL) cri teria at any  point during the study .
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL cr iteria to agree whether HL criteria are met.  
HL cri teria are m et if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver 
biochemistry  other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_33249].  
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting AE and SAE according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with 
standard safet y reporting processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s law (PHL)
AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin (TBL ) ≥2 × ULN at any  point during the 
study  following the start of IPi[INVESTIGATOR_72920] i n alkaline phosphatase (ALP).  
Hy’s law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicat ing 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug. 
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified ti me frame wit hin which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of potential Hy’s law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any  of thefollowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 129of 159ALT ≥3 × ULN
AST ≥3 × ULN
TBL ≥2 × ULN
The Investigator will wit hout delay review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] represe ntative
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_19690]
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Appendix E, E 2 for definit ion) by 
[CONTACT_33156] (incl uding both central  and l ocal 
laboratory  resul ts)
The Investigator will wit hout delay review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Appendix E, E 2 for definit ion) by 
[CONTACT_33156]
Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  CRF
E 4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s l aw criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the CSP.
E4.2 Potential Hy’s law criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria th e Investi gator will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 130of 159The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_73016]:
Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms 
and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as lo ng as medically  indicated. 
Invest igate the aetiology  of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed 
with the Study  Physician.
Com plete the 3 Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available. 
If at any  time (in consultat ion with the Study  Physici an) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures.
E 5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s law cases
The instructions in this Section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
No later than [ADDRESS_79113] and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the cr iteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF accordingly 
and fo llow the A straZeneca standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IP:
Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s law’) according to [COMPANY_008] Standard processes. 
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious criteria 
apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 131of 159If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 3 weeks in obtaining the informat ion necessary  to 
assess wheth er or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s law’) applying serious criteria and causalit y 
assessme nt as per above
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the 
review amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.
E 6 Actions required when potential Hy’s law criteria are met before 
and after starting study drug
This Section is applicable to patients with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on study  
drug having previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting Study treatment.
At the first on -study  drug occurrence of PHL cri teria being met, the Invest igator will 
determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condit ion#compared wi th the 
last vi sit where PHL cri teria were m et.#
If there is no significant change, no action is required.
If there is a significant change, notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will in form the 
central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described in Appendix E , E 5 .
# A ‘significant’ change in the pat ient’s condit ion refers to a clinically relevant change in 
any of the individual liver biochemistry  param eters (ALT, AST or TBL ) in iso lation or in 
combina tion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determinat ion 
of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion o f the Invest igator, 
this may  be in consul tation wi th the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.
E 7 Actions required for repeat epi[INVESTIGATOR_72921]’s law

RECIST 1.1 criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumours)
Introduction 
This appendix details the implementation o f RECIST 1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer et al  2009 ) 
for this study  with regard to Investigator assessment of tumour burden including 
protocol -specific requirements for this study .  Addit ional special guidance is provided for 
determinat ionof confirmat ion of radio logic progressio n.
Patients wi th measurable disease and/or non -measurable and/or NED assessed at baseline by 
[CONTACT_4654]/MRI will be entered in this study .
Definitions of measurable, non- measurable, target and non -target lesions
Measurable:
A lesio n that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥[ADDRESS_79114] di ameter 
(except lymph nodes which must have short axis1diameter of ≥15 mm) with CT or MRI and 
which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements.
Non-measurable:
All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10mm to <15 mm short axis diameter at baseline2).
Truly non -measurable lesio ns include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/perica rdial effusio n, inflammatory  breast di sease, lymphangit ic 
involvement of skin or lung, and abdo minal masses/abdominal organo megaly ident ified 
by [CONTACT_73017](manual  palpati on)that is not m easurable by  [CONTACT_462].
Brain metastasis.
Special cases:
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic–blast ic lesio ns, with ident ifiable so ft tissue com ponents, 
can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of 
measurabilit y.  Bl astic lesio ns are considered non -measurable.
Cystic met astases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measurabilit y from a radi ological  point of view, but if non -cystic lesions are present in the 
same patient, these should be selected over cy stic lesions as TLs.
                                               
1The short axis is defined as the longest axis perpendicular to long axis.
2Lymph nodes with <10 mm short axis diameter are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or 
followed as NTLs.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 134of 159Target lesions:
A maximum o f 5 measurable lesio ns (with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ), representative 
of all lesio ns involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs 
at baseline.  Lymph nodes, in any lo cation(local/regional and distant) , are coll ectively 
considered as a single organ, with a maximum o f 2 lymph nodes as TLs.  A bilateral organ 
(eg, adrenal glands), a segmented organ (eg, liver), or a mult ilobed organ (eg, lung) is each 
considered as a single organ .
A previously  irradiated l esion may be selected as a TL, provided that it fulfils the criteria for 
reproducible measurabilit y and is the only  lesion available.  
Non-target lesions:
Addit ional measurable lesio ns not recorded as TLs and non -measurable lesio ns (or sites of 
disease) shoul d be i dentified as NTLs at baseline.
Imaging modalities:
A summary  of the imaging modalit ies to be used for RECIST 1.1assessment of TL, NTL, and 
NLs is provided in Table 14.

CT and MRI
CT and MRI, each preferably with IVcontrast, are generally considered to generate the best 
currently available and reproducible anatomical images for measurement of TL, assessment of 
NTL, and i dentification o f any NLs. 
It is recommended that IV contrast -enhanced CT examinat ions of the chest and abdo men 
(including the ent ire liver and both adrenal glands) will be used to assess tumour burden at 
baseline and fo llow-up visi ts.  Any  other areas of disease involvement (eg, pelvis, brain) 
shoul d be addi tionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual pat ients.  In 
patients who are sensit ive to IV CT contrast, a n on-contrast CT examinat ion of the chest and 
an MRI wit h IV MRI contrast of the abdo men is appropriate.  In patients with severely

appropriate.  For brain lesio n assessment, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method over 
IV contrast -enhanced CT.  It is strongly reco mmended to maintain use of the same imagin g 
modality (CT or MRI), acqui sition protocol , facility and scanner across all imaging timepo ints 
per patient .
Clinical examination 
Clinical examinat ion of skin/surface lesio ns (by  [CONTACT_73018]) will 
not be used for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_79116] 1.1 assessment of tumours as it is not a 
reproducible acquisit ion method (operator dependent), is subject ive in int erpretati on and m ay

Endosc opy and laparoscopy 
Endoscopy  and l aparoscopy  will not be used for tumour assessments as they  are not validated 
in the context of tumour assessment.
Tumour markers 
Tumour markers on cy tological  or histol ogical (biopsy ) samples will not be used for tumour
response assessments as per RECIST 1.1.
Histology and cytology
Histology on tum our bi opsy  samples will not be used as part of the tumour response 
assessment as per RECIST 1.1. 
Results of cyto logical examinat ion for the neoplastic origin o f any effusi on (eg, asci tes, 
pericardial  effusi on, pleural  effusi on) that appears or worsens during the study  will not be 
used as part of the tumour response assessment in this study.  An effusio n that appears or

considered to be disease progression due to NLs or progressi on of  NTLs, respectively .
Isotopic bone scan 
Bone l esions i dentified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], MRI, or 
X-ray at baseline should be recorded as NTL and followed by  [CONTACT_73020].
Isotopi c bone scans m ay be used as a method of assessment to ident ify the presence of new 
bone lesio ns at follow -up visi ts.  N Lsmay be recorded in case posit ive hot -spots appea r on a 
bone scan that were not present on a previous bone scan; however, a newly observed 
equivocal hot -spot on a bone scan which cannot be verified with correlative imaging (CT, 
MRI, X -ray) of the same anatomical regio n shall not be the only trigger for a PD assessment 
at that timepo int.
FDG -PET/CT scan
18F-Fluoro -deoxyglucose positron emissio n tom ography/com puted tom ography  
(FDG -PET/CT) scans may be used as a method for identifying NLs, accordi ng to the 
following algori thm: NLswill be recorded where ther e is posi tive 18F-Fluoro -deoxyglucose 
uptake3not present on baseline or pri or FDG -PET scan or in a location corresponding to a 
new lesio n on CT/MRI at the same fo llow-up visit.  If there is no baseline or prior FDG -PET 
scan available, and no evidence of NLson CT/MRI scans then fo llow-up CT/MRI 
assessments should be cont inued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in order to 
verify NLs.
At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined FDG -PET/CT scan 
are of limited use i n anatomically -based efficacy assessments, and it is therefore suggested 
that they  shoul d not subst itute for dedicated diagnostic contrast -enhanced CT scans for tumour 
measurements by  [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  In except ional situations, if a study  site can docum ent tha t the 
CT performed, as part of a PET/CT examinat ion, is of ident ical diagnostic qualit y (with IV 
contrast) to a dedicated diagnostic CT scan, then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used 
for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_79117] introduces addit ional (PET) data that may bias an Investigator if it is not 
routi nely or serially performed .
                                               
3A positive FDG -PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake (eg, SUV) greater than twice that of 
the surrounding tissue or liver is observed.

Schedule of evaluation
The m ethods of assessment of tumour burden used at baseli ne CT/MRI scans o f the chest and 
abdo men (including the ent ire liver and both adrenal glands) must be used at each subsequent 
follow-up assessment.  Addit ional imaging may be performed based on the signs and 
symptoms of the patient, eg, NLs at follow-up .
Baseline assessments should be performed no more than [ADDRESS_79118] 1.1 for all patients will be assessed according to the 
schedules of assessment.  If an unscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not 
progressed, every  attem pt shoul d be m ade to perform  the subsequent assessments at their 
scheduled imaging visits . 
Target lesions
Documentation of target lesions
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns, with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ (including 
lymph nodes collectively considered as a single organ), representative of all lesio ns involved 
shoul d be i dentified as TL at baseline.  T Lsshoul d be sele cted on the basis o f their size 
(longest diameter for non -nodal lesio ns or short axis diameter for nodal lesio ns), but in 
addition shoul d be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may  
be the case that, on occasion, the larges t lesi on does not l end i tself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesio n, which can be measured 
reproducibly, should be selected.
The site and locat ion of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for 
non-n odal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in 
millimetres.  At baseline the sum o f the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum of diameters.  At fo llow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be 
calculated and reported as the follow-up sum  of diam eters .
Special cases:
For TL measurable in [ADDRESS_79119] diameter.  For 
pathol ogical lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis 
diameter.
If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at 
baseline shoul d be twi ce the slice thickness of the baseline scan.
If a lesio n has co mpletely disappeared, the diameter should be recorded as 0 mm.  If a 
lesion appears in the same location on a subsequent scan, it will be recorded as a NL.
If a TL split s into [ADDRESS_79120] the sum of the diameters of those parts.
Clinical Study Protocol -4.0 [COMPANY_008]

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 138of 159If 2 or more TLs merge then the sum o f the diameters of the combined lesio n sho uld be 
recorded for one of the lesio ns and 0 mm recorded for the other lesio n(s).
If a TL i s believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too sm all to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an est imate of the 
size of the lesio n.
When a TL has had any intervent ion eg, definit ive radi otherapy , embo lization, surgery , 
etc, during the st udy, the size o f the TL shoul d still be provided where possible and the 
intervent ion recorded in the RECIST 1.1 CRF.  If a TL has been completely remo ved 
(surgery ), the l ongest di ameter should be recorded as [ADDRESS_79121] ive tumour visit 
response for TL (see Table 15).
Table 15 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes selected as TLs must have a reduc tion in short axis diameter to 
<10mm.
Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking as 
reference the baseline sum of diameters .
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient decrease in sum of diameters to qualify for PR no r 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD .
Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the smallest previous sum of diameters (nadir) –this includes 
the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm from nadir.
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs at follow -up were not assessed or NE 
(eg,missing anatomy) or had a lesion intervention at this visit.  Note: if 
the sum of diameters meets the PD criteria, PD overrides NEas a TL 
response .
TL:Target lesion.
Non-target lesions
Evaluation of non -target lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites of di sease) not recorded as TL should be ident ified as NTL at 
baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be fo llowed 
at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be 
recorded by  [CONTACT_11856].  This sect ion provi des the definit ions of the criteria used to 
Clinical Study Protocol -4.0 [COMPANY_008]
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) , D4194C0000 [ADDRESS_79122] igational study  site at each visit 
(see Table 16).
Table 16 Evaluation of non -target lesions
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all NTLs since baseline.  All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/no n-PD Persistence of 1or more NTL.
Progression of disease (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs.  Unequivocal progression 
may be due to an important progression in 1lesion only or in several 
lesions.  In all cases the progression MUST be clinically significant for 
the phy sician to consider changing (or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) therapy.
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when 1or some of the NTLs were not assessed and, in the 
Invest igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they are not able to provide an evaluable overall 
NTL assessment at this visit.
Note: for patients without TLs at baseline, this is relevant if any of the 
NTLs were not assessed at this visit and the progression criteria have not 
been met .
NTL: Non -target lesion; TL: Target lesion.
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level o f 
substant ial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in TLs, 
the overall tumour burde n has increased sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion of therapy .  A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1or more NTLs i s usually not sufficient to qualify  for 
unequivocal progression status.
New lesions
Details o f any NLs will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of [ADDRESS_79123] appeared.
A lesio n identified at a follow -up assessment in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a NLand will indicate disease progression .
Symptomatic deterioration

for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_45806] .

Confirmation of radiological progression
A follow-up scan is performed after the ini tial RECIST 1.1 -defined PD, preferably at the next 
(and no l ater than the next) scheduled imaging visit, and no less th an [ADDRESS_79124] igator and 
patient (f ollowing consultation wit h [COMPANY_008]) can receive treatment until no longer having 
clinical benefit and will cont inue to have tumour assessments on their regular imaging 
schedule for the duration o f treatment.
Confirmation o f radiological  progressi on guidelines are set for the following reasons: 
For pati ent management and treatment decisio ns.
In the absence of significant clinical deterioration, to promote the collect ion of addit ional

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 141of 159Confirmation of Radiological P rogression Criteria
An immediate prior RECIST 1.1 -defined radio logic PD would be considered confirmed if any
of the fo llowing cri teria are m et in the subsequent fo llow-up scan (acquired preferably  at the 
next regularly scheduled imaging visit but no sooner than [ADDRESS_79126] 1.1‑defined PD scan) :
≥20% increase in the sum diameters of TLs co mpared with the nadir at [ADDRESS_79127] 5 mm in sum o f diameters com pared to 
nadir (as per RECIST 1.1 definit ion);
and/or significant progressi on (worsening) of NTLs at the fo llow-up scan timepo int 
compared wi th the i mmediate pri or timepoint (as per RECIST 1.1 definit ion);
and/or significant progressi on (worsening) of pre -exist ing NLs at the fo llow-up scan 
timepo int compared wit h the immediate prior timepoint (unique definit ion);
and/or additional (brand) new unequivoc al lesions at the follow -up scan timepo int (as per 
RECIST 1.1 definit ion).
NOTE: In order to have confirmed radio logical  progressi on, there should be 2consecut ive 
assessments meet ing the PD definit ion: the first PD by  [CONTACT_393] 1.1 and the second PD using 
the Confirmat ion of Radiological Progressi on Cri teria (above).  If the first assessment 
fulfilling the PD definit ion by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_79128] PD (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) is not confirmed by [CONTACT_73021], then the Investigator should not change the PD assessment of the 
first scan.
Specifications for anatomic al imaging
These notes are recommendations for use in clinical studies.  The use of standardized 
protocol s for CT and MRI allows comparabilit y both within and between different studies, 
irresp ective of where the examinat ion has been undertaken .

abdo men and pelvis.  Coverage should encom pass all  areas of known predilect ion for

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 142of 159metastases in the disease under evaluat ion and should addit ionally invest igate areas that may 
be involved based on signs and symptoms o f individual patients.  Because a lesio n later 
ident ified in a body part no t scanned at baseline would be considered as a new lesio n 
represent ing disease progression, careful consideration should be given to the extent of 
imaging coverage at baseline and at subsequent fo llow-up timepo ints.  This will enable better 
consistency not only of tumour measurements but also ident ificat ion of new disease .
b.IV contrast administration :Optimal visualizatio n and m easurement of m etastases in so lid 
tumours requi res consistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrast as well as timing of 
scanning.  Ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , most abdominal  imaging is perform ed during the portal venous phase 
and (optimally) about the same time frame after injection on each examinat ion.  An adequate 
volume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to 
best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ions for any  given pat ient.  
It is very  important that the sam e techni que be used at Baseline and on follow - up 
examinat ions for a gi ven pati ent.  F or pati ents who develo p contraindicat ions to con trast after 
baseline contrast CT is done, the decisio n as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or 
non-enhanced) shoul d be perform ed shoul d also be based on the tumour ty pe, anatomic 
location of the disease and should be opt imised to allow for com parison to the prior studies if 
possible.  Each case should be discussed wit h the radi ologist to determine if subst itution of  
these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered NEfrom that 
point forward .  Care must be taken in measurement of TLs on a different modalit y and 
interpretati on of  non-target di sease or NLs, since the same lesio n may appear to have a 
different size using a new modalit y.  Oral  contrast is reco mmended to help visualize and 
differe ntiate structures in the abdo men. 
If iodine contrast m edia is medically  contraindicated at baseline or at any  time during the 
course of the study ,then the recommended methods are: CT thoracic (chest) examinat ion 
without contrast and abdominal (and pelvis ) MRI wi th contrast.  If MRI cannot be performed ,
then CT wi thout IV contrast is an option for the thorax and abdo men (and pelvis) 
examinat ion.  For brain imaging, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method .
c. Slice thickness and reconstruction interval: It is recommended that CT scans be 
perform ed at 5 mm  cont iguous slice thickness and this guideline presumes a maximum 5 mm 
thickness in reco mmendat ions for measurable lesio n definit ion.  Exceptionally, particular 
institutions may  perform medically  accept able scans at slice thicknesses greater than 5 mm.  If 
this occurs, the minimum size o f measurable lesio ns at Baseline should be twice the slice 
thickness of the baseline scans.
All window settings should be included in the assessment, particularly in the thorax where 
lung and soft tissue windows should be considered.  When measuring lesio ns, the TL should 
be measured on the same window setting for repeated examinat ions throughout the study .  All

images of the apparent lesio n.
MRI scan
MRI has excellent contrast, spatial and temporal resolut ion; however, there are many  image 
acquisit ion variables invo lved in MRI, which greatly impact image qualit y, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_72922] y 
and mea surement.  Furthermore, the availabilit y of MRI is variable glo bally .  The m odali ty 
used at follow -up shoul d be the same as was used at baseline and the lesio ns should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  Generally, axial imaging o f the abdo men and 
pelvis (and other anatomies [eg, neck]) with T1 and T2 weighted imaging alo ng with 
gadolinium -enhanced imaging can be performed.  The field of view, matrix, number of 
excitat ions, phase encoding steps, use of fat suppressio n and fast sequences should be 
optimi sed for the specific body  part being imaged as well as the scanner utili sed.  CT of the 
chest is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_72923] (heart, major 
blood vessels, breathing) associated with MRI.  It is beyo nd the sco pe of this appendix to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body  parts and diseases.  
Ideally , the same ty pe of  scanner shoul d be used, and the image acquisit ion protocol should be 
followed as closely  as possible to pri or scan s.  Body  scans shoul d be perform ed wi th 
breath -hold scanning techniques if possible .
For these reasons, CT is the imaging modalit y of choi ce.

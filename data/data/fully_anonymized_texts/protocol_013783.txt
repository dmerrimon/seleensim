 INDIANA UNIVERSITY INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT FOR
Use of Low Dose Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849468] a research study tes ting the use of a low dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (Actos) to
treat polycystic kidney disease. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849469] a low dose of the same drug for the treatment of polycystickidney disease. You were selected as a possible subject because you have been diagnosed withautosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and you are in an early stage of the disease .We ask that
you read this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.
The study is being conducted by [CONTACT_6283]. Sharon Moe and Robert Bacallao of Indiana University School of
Medicine (IUSM) and [CONTACT_849498]-Yost of Indi ana University Purdue University Indianapolis
(IUPUI).
STUDY PURPOSE
The purpose of this study is to determine whet her the diabetes drug pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (Actos) is a safe and
effective treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease when treated in its early stages.Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849470]. Pre-clinical (animal) models ofpolycystic kidney disease have shown that low dose treatment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_849471]. The dosage used in the animal studies also suggest thateffective pi[INVESTIGATOR_849472].
The purpose of this study is to see if pi[INVESTIGATOR_849473]. This drug has not
previously been tested in humans with cystic kidney disease.
NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:
If you agree to participate, you will be one of up to 45 subjects who will be participating in this research.
PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY:
This is a placebo controlled study. This means for half of the study you will get the active drug and for
the other half of the study you will get a fake pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. This study involves the following visits and tests:
Screening Visits:
This visit is to determine if you are eligible to participate in the study. This visit will be at Indiana
University and you may be asked to bring previous medical records documenting your polycystic kidneydisease.
During this visit you will have the following tests and procedures:
xReview and sign consent (if you agree to participate)
xA review of your medical history
xPhysical exam

not had the same blood tests done in the last 3 months.
xIf the above indicate eligibility, you will be sc heduled to come back and undergo a magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) procedure to dete rmine the size of your kidney and liver.

RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:
While on the study, the risks, side effects and/or discomforts are:
BLOOD DRAW:
The risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and/or fainting, or rarely, infection
at the site of the needle stick.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
This test uses sound waves to look at your heart. The p erson doing the test will press on your chest with a
machine to obtain the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. The pressure may be uncomfortable.
BIOELECTRIAL IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS:
This is a test to measure your body water content to determine if the drug is causing you to retain fluid. It is performed by [CONTACT_849488] a measurement.There is no sensation or pain associated with this procedure. Patients with amputated limbs cannotparticipate in this test. The test takes less than 10 minutes
MRI:
There is no radiation associated with MRI, but pe ople who have metal devices like pacemakers cannot have 
an MRI and will not be able to participate in the study. Some people with claustrophobia (fear of being
closed in small spaces) may feel too closed in and may not tolerate MRI scanning. If you feel too confined in 
the MRI scanner you can inform the technologist and the MRI scan will be stopped. The MRI machine makes loud knocking sounds when it is scanning. Because of this you will be asked to wear earplugs while
getting your MRI scan.  The earplugs minimize discomfort from noise and keep the MRI noise within the
safety range.
PI[INVESTIGATOR_849478]:
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849479]. Subjects will be monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure after initiation andif heart failure occurs the drug will be discontinued.
Common side effects of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849480]:
xFluid retention including swelling of the ankles (edema)
xIncreased weight
xHeadache
xGastrointestinal: Diarrhea, Flatulence, Indigestion, Malabsorption syndrome (when the body
cannot fully absorb nutrients from the intestines), Nausea and Vomiting
xRespi[INVESTIGATOR_849481], si nus infection and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].
xHypoglycemia or low blood sugar. The symptoms include dizziness, sweating and decreased
ability to concentrate.
Less common but serious side effects include:
xCongestive heart failure or inability to breath due to fluid in the lungs
Protocol [PHONE_17651] IRB Approve d
Version Date 5.31.17 6Protocol # [PHONE_17651] 
 xElevation in liver enzymes (0.3%)
xMalignant tumor of urinary bladder (0.16% to 0.44% )
xPneumonia
xDiabetic macular edema (swelling and fluid retention in the eyes)
xFracture: Your risk of fracture may be lower than in  other studies because of your younger age, lower 
dose, and shorter time on the drug, but the precise risk is currently unknown.
As with all drugs, it is possible that pi[INVESTIGATOR_849482], although this has not been seen
so far. Tell your doctor immediately if you have symptoms of an allergic reaction which include:
xitching
xrash
xswelling in the mouth, tongue, face, or throat.
UNKNOWN RISKS:
During the study, tell your study doctor if you get any side effect, whether it is listed here or not. If you are
worried, contact [CONTACT_458398]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849483]. It is unknown if it will lower blood sugar levels in individuals who do not have diabetes.
BREAST FEEDING:
Available evidence and/or expert consensus is inconc lusive or is inadequate for determining infant risk
when used during breastfeeding. Women who wish to breast feed will be excluded from the study.
PREGNANCY:
The effect of pi[INVESTIGATOR_849484] a fetus (developi[INVESTIGATOR_191278]), or on a breastfeeding infant, is
unknown and may be harmful. Because of these risks, women of child bearing age may take part in this study
if they agree to use birth control and take a urine pregnancy test each month while participating in this study.Urine pregnancy tests will be given to women at each visit for them to take home and use for months in between each visit. If a woman becomes pregnant during the study, she will be removed from the study.
If you learn you are pregnant between study visits, you must notify the study staff immediately.
If you are a female and sexually active and able to become pregnant, you must agree to use one of the birth 
control methods listed below and take a monthly UPT:
Hormonal methods, such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, injections, vaginal ring, or implants
Barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a foam, cream, or gel
that kills sperm)
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Abstinence (no sex)
If you are a male and sexually active and able to father a c hild, you must agree to use one of the birth control
methods listed below:
Barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a foam, cream, or gel
that kills sperm)
Hormonal methods used by [CONTACT_849489], such as birt h control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, injections, vaginal ring,
or implants
Intrauterine device (IUD) used by [CONTACT_849489]
Abstinence (no sex)
You must use birth control for the entire study and for at least one month after your last dose of study drug.

 Blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_849490].
Heart echo will be done by [CONTACT_849491].
Earplugs minimize discomfort from noise and keep the MRI noise within the safety range.
Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of fluid retention and heart failure after initiation and if 
heart failure occurs the drug will be discontinued. If edema or swelling of the legs is observed, you will beasked to follow a low salt diet, and possibly take a water pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  If you become short of breath on the study,you will be asked to get an additional heart echo study. This will require [ADDRESS_1181159] low 
blood sugar symptoms (eg. dizziness, nauseated, or confused)) , you will be given a glucometer to test your
blood by a finger stick (using a lance, or small needle) at various time points and when you feel dizzy,nauseated or confused. You will be asked to keep a log of these symptoms and check the blood sugar for one
month. If the blood sugars are found to be repeated ly low then you will be dropped from the study. This may
require an additional visit.
While you are receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_341548], you will be questioned at each visit about possible side
effects and you will be monitored by [CONTACT_849492].
Records will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked office and subjects will be identified by a study number
and not a name.

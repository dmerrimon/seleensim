Utilizing a Lupus Patient Navigator Program (LPNP) to Address Barriers to Care Related to Access to 
Preventive and Specialty Healthcare, Medication Adherence and Health Literacy in  Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (SLE) for Minority Patients  
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  
[INVESTIGATOR_14407] C. Oates, MD   
 
 
1.0 Objectives  / Specific Aims  
To improve health care delivery to minority patients with SLE at highest risk for poor 
outcomes, utilizing patient navigators to address barriers to care related to access to preventive and specialty healthcare, medication adherence, and health literacy . 
 
2.0 Background  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_259897], minorities c ontinue to bear the greater 
burden of disease with disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality compared to white patients with SLE (1). Longitudinal studies of patients with SLE demonstrate a strong genetic component impacting the development of SLE and the risk of severe disease ( 2); however the development  of 
irreversible SLE -related and medication -related organ damage is undeniably complicated by [CONTACT_259905] ( 2, 3). Patients frequently are sent home from clinic or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259898].  In the lupus Medicaid population, a large fraction of patients have  medication non- adherence leading to 
increased risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( 4). Every year 25% of SLE patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82800] 16% of 
those are readmitted within 30 days ( 5). Other factors associated with poor outcomes include 
transportation (6) and family caregiving obligations among others.  Patients return with either 
complications of inappropriate treatment or organ failure (nephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage) from their disease.  
 Although we cannot change the patient’s genetic risk factors or socioeconomic status, we can identify and modify the barriers to SLE care that lead to poor health outcomes (such as difficulty accessing primary and specialty healthcare, low health literacy,  harmful attitudes and beliefs 
regarding SLE and its treatment). 
 
3.[ADDRESS_316053] been utilized successfully to improve health outcomes by [CONTACT_259906], including cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. A recent systematic review of patient navigator interventions found that 45 of the 67 randomized controlled trials reported statistically significant improvements in the primary outcomes  (7). Since the first patient navigation program in the 1980s 
focused on breast cancer outcomes, there has been over a decade of successful use of patient 
Version 12; 04FEB2021 
 Page 2 of 12   navigators in oncology. Consequently, for accreditation, cancer centers are required by [CONTACT_259907] 2015 ( https://www.facs.org/quality -programs/cancer
). 
 The navigator services most commonly provided include facilitation/coordination of care, practical support, including transportation and financial assistance, appointment scheduling and reminders, education and psychosocial support (7) . The most effective patient navigators address both health 
system barriers and patient barriers (examples shown in Table 1).     Targeted interventions have been proposed to address the common barriers to care among patients with SLE (8-10) , but a comprehensive patient navigator approach utilizing novel interventions based 
on evidence from prior studies, such as the one proposed, has yet to be described in the literature.

Improvement in Medication Adherence, Improvement in patient -reported lupus -specific 
disease status (measured by [CONTACT_259910]) , Improvement in Adherence with Primary Care  
/ Specialty Care Visits , Lab and other Study Appointments . 
Racial Discrimination will be measured using the validated 9 -item Experiences of Discrimination 
(EOD) measure, which includes an index of racial discrimination experiences ever experienced.  The EOD is a widely used and validated measure of racial discrimination.  This short, 
self-report instrument is based on a prior instrument used in the Coronary Artery Risk Development 
in Young Adults (CARDIA) study validated in AA and Latino participants and has been previously used for measuring experiences of racial discrimi nation in AA women with SLE. (11).

Recruitment will be enhanced by [CONTACT_259911].  
 
 
6.0 Number of Subjects  
  Sample size of n=25 patients in the Patient Navigation Group and n=[ADDRESS_316056] (see Sections 12 & 13 below) to the CCCR and  provided to study staff.  
  
7.0 Setting  
  MUSC Rheumatology clinics, MUSC inpatient setting 
 
8.0 Recruitment Methods  
 
The patient's primary rheumatologist can  refer the patient to the PI/study staff for eligibility review 
after discussing with the patient.  If needed, Epic (EMR) rheumatology- specific clinic schedules and 
charts of those patients seeing those rheumatologists  (PI/Co -I) will be reviewed weekly for patients 
with lupus and self -identified as a minority. These patients will be contact[CONTACT_205903]/Study Staff only 
if they not opted out for research contact. Additionally, outreach and advertising materials will be 
used to promote and introduce the study to potential candidates.  Material will be made available to PI/Co -I's for discussions with pts,  within MUSC Rheumatology Clinic waiting rooms for pt initiated 
access/interest, as well as hardcopy and electronic versions (email) to potential pts as appropriate following preferred communication method of the pt as noted in Epic.  Outside of any direct in-person exchange/presentation, there will be an accompanying notification that explains the contact  
(i.e. brochure ). Eligibility will be confirmed by [CONTACT_978]. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_259912]/or at their clinic visit.    
 We do not anticipate difficulty enrolling [ADDRESS_316057] 35% of the [ADDRESS_316058] two years meet the demographic (age, race, disease duration) and medication criteria.  
 
Version 12; 04FEB2021  
 Page 5 of 12   9.0 Consent Process  
 
IRB approved personnel  are authorized and qualified to obtain consent. The informed consent 
document may be sent to potential subjects prior to scheduling a screening visit, either by [CONTACT_259913], for their review.  
 Informed consent will be obtained in a private clinic room. The consent will be explained to the subjects and they may take time to read the document; subjects will be given ample time to review 
the ICF and ask questions; subject's questions will be answered by [CONTACT_1755]/or study staff. After signing, subjects will be given a signed/dated copy of the I CF. There is no wait period. 
No study procedures will be performed prior to obtaining written informed consent. 
 
To reduce barriers to enroll in the study during times of unexpected campus and/or clinic shutdowns 
(pandemics, weather occurrences, etc. ), remote consent option will be available. Participants will 
have the option to complete consent 1) via MUSC’s doxy.me system (tele consent) or 2) via REDCap electronic consent (e- consent) combined with a phone discussion. These procedures for 
consenting remote study participants are in line with the IRB approved procedures and are supported 
through MUSC SCTR Services.  A ll doxy.me signed consent forms will be saved as PDF files within 
our study records. Signatures on the consent form may be obtained electronically via REDCap/doxy.me.  To minimize concerns of errors/compliance with execution, Doxy.me  will be 
the primary mode of eConsent  with REDCap serv ing as a backup method in case there are system 
compatibility or end user concerns experienced.   Participants will be encouraged to print and/or save a copy for their resource.  If they do not have the ability to do so, a co py of the executed  ICF 
will be provided to them at their next in -person visit or mailed per their preference.  
 No undue coercion or influence will be utilized for recruitment. The amount of compensation 
subjects may receive is nominal. All possible subjects will be treated the same. All patients that may screen fail or choose not to participate in the study will not have their standard of care altered or lose access to care.

Monthly Phone Calls post signing of informed consent : 
1) Steps to Care Reassessment Form  
 
The PN will   contact [CONTACT_259914] . Contacts can be via phone, 
text, email, or MyChart as preferred by [CONTACT_3445].  These appointments are not only standard of 
care rheumatology visits but also associated to the research study in question. These contacts  will 
be completed 15 days and 2 days prior to rheumatology clinic visit. 
 
Additionally, the PN will calls  the patients one week following any changes in medications for their 
SLE ( per primary Rheumatologist or patient reported) and will ensure patient has filled in proper 
Version 12; 04FEB2021 
 Page [ADDRESS_316060]. The PN will respond to phone 
calls from participating patients for health and general questions, notifying the appropriate medical 
provider when necessary and documenting all patient -initiated calls in the EMR. The PN will assess 
whether the patients’ basic needs are being met ( i.e. are there adequate resources for food, housing, 
medications, etc.) and make referrals for support services as needed (to include referrals for dietary modifica tion, smoking cessation, exercise, obesity prevention, psychiatry, and substance abuse). 
 For each of these in -person visits with surveys, participants will be compensated $10 (for a total of 
$50.00 over 12 months of participation). Compensation will be delivered vi a ClinCard. The in-
person PN visits will be planned in conjunction with scheduled outpatient clinic visits.  
For the Usual Care Group only: As stated above, in order to properly obtain data, while minimizing 
risk to patients in this study, the study staff will only utilize data for those patients that have already enrolled in the Division of Rheumatology Core Center for Clinical Research (CCCR; Pro21985). These patients will have provided properly executed HIPAA authorization to utilize Pr otected 
Health Information through the CCCR for optional research portions of the CCCR study (see General Comments of IRB application to review CCCR HIPAA Authorization). Data on healthcare utilization and adherence to prescribed medications based on pharmacy records would be collected on the U sual Care group as part of standard quality of care monitoring, which are allowed to be 
collected through the CCCR; Pro21985. This data will be provided through a formal request process, reviewed by [CONTACT_259915], and provided to this study’s staff via this request. Note that this group of patients (Usual Care) will not have a formal informed consent 
process completed and executed as only analysis of data already collected for standard of care is necessary and falls under the HIPAA Authorization for the CCCR. 
  
11.0 Specimen Collection and Banking  
No specimens will be collected.  
12.0 Data Management   
 
The MUSC CCCR Patient Resource Core (Pro00021985)  will act as an  honest broker for the 
provision of clinical data of patients that fit criteria and are already enrolled in the CCCR study. The 
clinical data provided to the PN and PI [INVESTIGATOR_259901] 4.0 & 10.0 and will be provided to study staff de -identified. The data provided will only include 25 patient 
data sets for the “Usual Care” group that has n ot had contact [CONTACT_259916].  
 
Analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature.  Means, standard deviations, medians, inter -quartile 
ranges, and proportions will be reported on each outcome of interest, as appropriate.  These statistics will be reported at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and at 12 months for the primary outcome measure 
(Medication Adherence ) and all secondary  outcome measures. The secondary outcome measures 
are 1) Adherence with Primary Care and Specialty Care Visits , 2) Adherence with Lab and other 
Study Appointments, 3)  Healthcare Utilization , 4) Disease- related Damage, 5) Corticosteroid Use  
and 6) Patient -Reported Outcomes .   
  In addition to results reported by [CONTACT_74554], we will report results from our collaborating site, University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB), during their implementation of the LPNP protocol.  
Version 12; 04FEB2021  
 Page 9 of 12   Analyses will include estimates of site to site variability utilizing a combined MUSC and UAB 
dataset.  All data sharing will be de -identified and maintained on MUSC’s supported REDCap 
platform.  Shared data and analyses were included in the Scope of Work executed by [CONTACT_259917] 3P30AR072582- 03S1, Improving Minority Health in Rheumatic Diseases.    
 
Although this is not a randomized trial, we will use statistical methods such as propensity score 
weighting (36) to gain an understanding of how the use of PNs improves outcomes (e.g. medication 
adherence) when compared to usual care.  Generalized linear mixed models will be used in conjunction with propensity score weighting to compare treatment group outcomes and estimate 
relevant effect sizes while adjusting for relevant baseline covariates (e.g. age, SLEDAI) and 
accounting for repeated measures within patients over time. 
 
Since we will have all healthcare utilization data over the 12 -month time, calculations will also be 
performed to indicate how intervention and control patients compared monthly throughout the 
study.  These data will hel p us design a larger randomized, multi -center, clinical trial.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_259902].  
 
Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], our sample size of n=25 patients in the PN group and n=25 pa tients in the 
“Usual C are” group were selected primarily to ensure that we can  assess feasibility of providing this 
intervention in this high- risk population.  Having n=25 patients in each group will also allow us to 
estimate group -specific outcomes with relatively strong precision (i.e. within ± 0.[ADDRESS_316061] 
deviations for continuous outcomes and ±10% -20% percentage points for proportions).  All  this 
information will b e vital for designing a future, definitive randomized controlled trial. In obtaining 
preliminary estimates of effectiveness, our sample sizes will also provide sufficient power (>80%) 
to detect moderate differences in medication adherence rates between treatment groups, assuming 
2-sided hypothesis testing and an alpha level of 0.05.   
 
 
13.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of Subjects  
 
The investigator and other study personnel will keep confidential any information related to this 
study, all data and records generated during conducting the study, and will not use the information, data, or records for any purpose other than conducting the study. These restrictions do not apply to: (1) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the investigator or site personnel; (2) information that is necessary to disclose in confidence to an IRB solely for the evaluation of the study; (3) information that is necessary to disclose in order to provide appropriate medical care to a patient; or (4) study results that may be published in an aggregate fashion. 
 
All data will be stored  on MUSC Network Storage with survey results entered into a secure MUSC 
REDCap  database, only accessible by [CONTACT_259918] .  The data  from the two institutions (MUSC and UAB) will be maintained 
separately , with data entry and editing performed only by [CONTACT_1744] -approved personnel specific to each 
site.   
 
Patients will be assigned an identification number. Personal identifiers will not be accessible to individuals beyond the investigative site. Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_259919]. All study related documents  (physical paper documents, if needed)  and materials will be 
Version 12; 04FEB2021 
 Page 10 of 12   kept in secured locked file cabinets in a locked office space of the Division of Rheumatology with 
limited access by [CONTACT_105] -study personnel. 
 
 
14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
Subjects can withdrawal at any time during the 12 -month study simply by [CONTACT_259920]. 
 
15.0 Risks to Subjects  
 
Confidentiality : There is the potential risk of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to 
keep information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed. After the study is completed, the 
data may be placed in a central storage location or public database. This will include all  the 
information learned from this study and not just information specific to an individual patient. Any data will not include patients’ names or other information that can identify an individual patient. 
The purpose is  to make study data available to other researchers who must request permission to 
use it.  
 
Questionnaires/Surveys: The questions that will be asked may be sensitive in nature and make the 
patient feel uncomfortable. The patient may be asked personal questions that the patient finds distressing. The patient may refuse to answer any question(s) that they do not wish to a nswer.  
  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  or Others  
 
If having a Patient Navigator improves a patient's compliance with medication adherence, clinic and lab appointments, the patient's overall health and quality of life may improve. It may also reduce the SLE related damage to vital organs which may improve overall health and quality of life. However, this cannot be guaranteed.    
17.[ADDRESS_316062] access to data in the patient’s EMR.  Results of survey data will 
not be shared with the participants. All other data is a part of the participant’s standard of care and thus is continuously shared with them via their care providers.  
 
18.0 Drugs or Devices (if applicable)  
 
 No drugs or devices will be used in this study.

Protocol ML42492 71. BACKGROUND
1.1 BACKGROUND 
In less than five months since the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 
December 2019, millions of patients worldwide have suffered acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_14437], many 
of whom ultimately require mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. This 
disease (COVID-19) has been associated with a hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state1 
leading to a range of thromboembolic complications from pulmonary embolism to ischemic 
stroke.2,[ADDRESS_699953] in part, due to pulmonary vascular disease caused by [CONTACT_84798]- and/or macro-emboli creating 
pulmonary vascular shunting and dead-space ventilation.4,[ADDRESS_699954] caused by [CONTACT_537453][INVESTIGATOR_1421] (ARDS).6,7 
Given these observations, in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic hitting [LOCATION_001] City, 
critically ill patients with severe hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_61491]-19 were treated with 
intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). In a case series of 
four patients, rapid physiologic improvements in alveolar ventilation, oxygenation, and/or 
hemodynamics was noted.18 Wang et al8 also noted similar results with tPA in this patient 
population. In both of these case series, the physiologic effects of tPA were only temporary. It 
was only with the concomitant use of anticoagulation with heparin were these physiologic 
benefits sustained, likely because anticoagulation prevented immediate rethrombosis in this 
exceptionally prothrombotic condition.18 Given that tPA is contraindicated for concomitant use 
with heparin infusion, this protocol is created to assess tenecteplase as a thrombolytic agent in 
patients with COVID-19, as there is a very long-standing literature documenting the safety of 
tenecteplase with concomitant heparin infusion.  There is an additional logistic benefit to 
tenecteplase, in that it is given as a single bolus.  The logistic challenges of providing a 
prolonged alteplase infusion to a COVID-19 patient, wherein the IV pumps are outside the room 
and the IV tubing is in excess of 7 feet long, is quite formidable. 
1.2 CURRENT THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_537426], there is no proven therapy for COVID-19 associated respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  A recent 
publication has suggested that systemic anticoagulation may help these patients19, but the data 
is far from definitive.  Additionally, a case series and ongoing clinical trial (at other centers) is 
assessing the potential value of tPA thrombolysis in this patient population.  We believe that 
TNK is uniquely situated to be of benefit for this population.
1.3 BACKGROUND ON TENECTEPLASE
Tenecteplase (TNKase) is a modified form of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that 
binds to fibrin and converts plasminogen to plasmin.  In vitro studies demonstrated that in the 
presence of fibrin, tenecteplase conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is increased relative to its 
conversion in the absence of fibrin.  This fibrin specificity decreases systemic activation of 
plasminogen and the resulting degradation of circulating fibrinogen compared with a molecule 
lacking this property, which could potentially decrease the incidence of bleeding.

1.3.1 Approved Indication in US and Europe
In the US, TNKase® (tenecteplase) is indicated for use in the reduction of mortality associated 
with AMI.  
1.4 OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT
Tenecteplase has been previously developed in other indications and has been approved for 
the treatment of AMI.  Tenecteplase is being developed by [CONTACT_131688] a treatment for AIS 
4.5 to 24 hours after stroke onset, in patients who show a salvageable brain pattern by 
[CONTACT_537454].  
Tenecteplase has been studied extensively in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 
The ASSENT-2 trial,9 for example, analyzed 16,949 patients with AMI randomized to either IV 
bolus of tenecteplase or infusion of alteplase, followed by [CONTACT_537455] 
48-72 hours (goal aPTT 50-75). All-cause mortality was nearly identical between the two 
groups; however, the authors noted a pragmatic advantage inherent with a single bolus of 
tenecteplase compared to an infusion of alteplase. Tenecteplase is also associated with a lower 
rate of systemic bleeding compared to alteplase.  The ASSENT-3 and ASSENT-3 PLUS trials 
provide further confirmation of the safety of anticoagulation administration following 
tenecteplase,10,11 
Tenecteplase has been studied for patients with pulmonary embolism.15 In the PEITHO trial, the 
use of tenecteplase at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg with concomitant anticoagulation reduced the rate of 
hemodynamic decompensation in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism. This 
benefit, along with lower bleed rates, was particularly notable in participants younger than 75 
years old. Eight of 13 (62%) participants who suffered stroke in PEITHO were > 75 years old; 
two of the eleven (18%) participants who suffered hemorrhagic stroke were < 75 years old.
Completed and ongoing clinical studies of tenecteplase are summarized in the Tenecteplase 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.4.1 Acute Myocardial Infarction Clinical Development
Tenecteplase is indicated for use in the reduction of mortality associated with AMI and has been 
approved since 2000.  Completed and ongoing clinical studies of tenecteplase are summarized 
in the Tenecteplase Investigator's Brochure.  
1.4.2 Acute Ischemic Stroke Clinical Development
Tenecteplase is being evaluated for safety and efficacy in a Phase III in AIS stroke patients, 
4.5−24 hours after symptom onset, who show a salvageable brain pattern by [CONTACT_537456] (Study ML40787).  Study ML40787 TIMELESS (Thrombolysis in Imaging Eligible 
Late Window Patients to assess the efficacy and safety of Tenecteplase) is currently enrolling 
and plans to enroll 456 acute ischemic stroke patients in the US and Canada.  Patients with 
large vessel occlusions, with a diffusion/perfusion mismatch, in the 4.5−24 hour window may be 
eligible to receive tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or placebo in conjunction with mechanical 
thrombectomy.

Protocol ML42492 9Completed and ongoing clinical studies of tenecteplase are summarized in the Tenecteplase 
Investigator’s Brochure.
Studies have also demonstrated the benefit of tenecteplase in acute ischemic stroke. In the 
EXTEND-IA TNK trial,13 tenecteplase combined with endovascular thrombectomy was 
associated with higher probability of radiographic reperfusion as well as long term functional 
outcomes in patients with large vessel intracranial occlusions as compared to alteplase.  This 
benefit was seen at a lower dose (0.25 mg/kg) than the MI studies (0.5 mg/kg).  A subsequent 
study, EXTEND-IA TNK II, found no increased risk but no clinical benefit in stroke to increasing 
the TNK dose to 0.4 mg/kg.[ADDRESS_699955] a 
mortality rate as high as 88%.16 This dismal mortality rate has driven us to make clinical 
decisions regarding the use of off-label application of otherwise FDA approved medications in a 
hope to improve outcomes.  Therefore, we undertook the off-label utilization of tenecteplase (at 
the lower EXTEND-IA TNK dosing) with concomitant heparin administration for the treatment of 
5 refractory COVID-19 patients. We were highly encouraged by [CONTACT_537457], alveolar ventilation, and hemodynamics within 24-48 
hours. Four of the five patients had shock resolution, while the fifth patient had dramatic 
reductions in vasopressor requirements. No clinically significant bleeding was noted in any of 
these patients. As a result, we believe that a high-quality prospective Phase II, dose escalation 
trial is indicated. 
To assess the efficacy of tenecteplase on critically ill patients with COVID-19 and hypoxic 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], we propose a multi-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind, dose-
escalation trial comparing tenecteplase versus placebo. We intend to enroll 60 subjects: 40 
randomized for intervention (20 each at doses of TNK, 0.25 mg/kg and 0.50 mg/kg) and 20 for 
placebo. Planned inclusion criteria are confirmed respi[INVESTIGATOR_537427] 48 hours, or non-rebreather (NRB), high-flow nasal cannula 
(HFNC), or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for less than 96 hours, with 
confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus (PCR positive within 14 days), elevated D-dimer (2 
times upper limit of normal,17 and lack of stringent exclusion criteria. Primary efficacy outcome 
will be clinical status assessment at 28 days (proportion of patients alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518]). Primary safety outcome will be rate of ICH or major acute hemorrhage (defined as 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_537428] [such 
as replacement of fluid and/or blood products, inotropic support, or surgical treatment], or life-
threatening or fatal bleeding).  Secondary outcomes include survival, ventilator-free days, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]-free days, vasopressor-free days, improvement in PaO2/FiO2, and ICU and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].

The total length of the study, from screening of the first patient to the end of the study, is 
expected to be approximately [ADDRESS_699957]. 
3.3.1 Rationale for Tenecteplase Dose and Schedule
Tenecteplase is a triple combination mutant of alteplase, with a longer half-life, improved 
specificity for fibrin, and higher resistance to degradation by [CONTACT_537458]-activator inhibitor.22 
One practical clinical advantage over other thrombolytic drugs is the ability to bolus a single 
dose of tenecteplase, compared to longer infusions required for efficacy (i.e. alteplase). 
Tenecteplase was first studied in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the 1990s. In the TIMI 10A 
trial, tenecteplase was found to be effective for coronary reperfusion in patients with AMI and 
had a safety profile comparable to wild-type tPA.23 The follow up TIMI 10B trial randomized 886 
patients with early (≤12 hr) AMI to either bolus tenecteplase or bolus + infusion of tPA, plus 
coronary angiography and postprocedural heparin infusion.24 The study authors found that 
overall rates of TIMI grade 3 reperfusion were similar between the two groups, but this finding 
was found in patients who received higher doses of tenecteplase (50 mg versus 30 mg), albeit 
with higher risk of symptomatic bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. The risks of hemorrhage 
were reduced in both groups by [CONTACT_537459]. A further safety assessment of 
tenecteplase, relative to alteplase, was published in 1999 through the ASSENT-1 trial, in which 
a total of 325 patients were given a single bolus of tenecteplase in escalating doses (30, 40, or 
50 mg).25 Overall rates of intracranial hemorrhage were low (0.77% overall), did not depend on 
dose, and were comparable to historical data on tPA. Overall, the authors recommend a weight-
based dosing strategy for patients with AMI.
Based on these positive safety trials, subsequent trials were published directly comparing 
tenecteplase and alteplase. ASSENT-2 was a double-blind, controlled trial randomizing 16,949 
patients to either weight based tenecteplase bolus (0.5 mg/kg) or infusion with tPA, plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_537430].26 The primary outcome of all-cause mortality at 30 days was similar for the 
two groups (6.18% and 6.15% for tenecteplase and tPA, respectively). Rates of intracranial 
hemorrhage were also similar between the two groups, although the risk of other hemorrhage 
was higher for tPA.
Given the positive results in the cardiac literature, tenecteplase has also been trialed for acute 
ischemic stroke; however, there has been limited adoption compared to alteplase following the 
NINDS trial in 1995.[ADDRESS_699958] dose-escalation study was published in 2005 and 
assessed tenecteplase doses between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg.28 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_537431] (ICH) between 0.1 and 0.4 mg/kg doses, no symptomatic 
ICH were seen. However, the 0.5 mg/kg tier was terminated prematurely given a high incidence

Protocol ML42492 12of symptomatic ICH (2 of 13 patients). Overall long-term functional outcomes were similar 
between the lower dose tenecteplase and historical controls treated with tPA.
The ATTEST trial randomized 104 patients with acute ischemic stroke to receive either TNK or 
tPA.29 The primary endpoint of salvaged penumbra was identical between the two groups 
(68%), and rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were not statistically different (2% and 
4% for TNK and tPA, respectively, p=0.55). Another randomized controlled trial published in 
2012 assessed either alteplase infusion or dose-escalated tenecteplase (0.1 or 0.25 mg/kg) in 
patients with acute ischemic stroke less than 6 hours after symptom onset.30 Patients treated 
with tenecteplase had better rates of radiographic reperfusion as well as short- and long-term 
clinical improvement, with higher doses (0.25 mg/kg) performing better than lower. Rates of 
intracranial and non-intracranial hemorrhages were consistent in all three groups.
Most recently the EXTEND-IA TNK trial assessed 202 patients randomized to either 
tenecteplase bolus (0.25 mg/kg) or alteplase prior to endovascular thrombectomy for large 
vessel occlusion.31 The primary outcome of angiographic reperfusion prior to thrombectomy (or 
absence of retrievable thrombus) was significantly greater in the TNK group, compared with 
tPA, present in 22% and 10%, respectively. Tenecteplase was also associated with 
improvement in 90-day functional outcomes, and similar rates of symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage.
Tenecteplase has also been assessed for use in treating pulmonary embolism (PE). In general, 
thrombolysis for PE has been shown to have minimal evidence for clinical benefit compared 
with heparin, except in those with the highest risks of recurrence or death.32 In clinical trials, 
thrombolysis with alteplase has been associated with improvements in hemodynamic 
parameters (including pulmonary resistance and cardiac index) but have indeterminate effects 
on overall clinical outcomes given a paucity of data.33 In one randomized, placebo-controlled 
trial of tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg) plus heparin versus heparin alone, intermediate-
risk patients with PE treated with TNK had lower risk of hemodynamic decompensation or 
death.[ADDRESS_699959] increased odds of good outcome after treatment with tenecteplase, 
compared with placebo, according to a randomized trial published in 2014.35
Based on this evidence, dosing guidelines for this trial will be as follows:
Patients will be monitored in the ICU immediately post-treatment and until [ADDRESS_699960] 
passed and they are considered stable to downgrade to lower level of care.
A. For patients already on therapeutic heparin, continue heparin infusion
B. For patients not already on heparin or other anticoagulant, begin heparin with 
tenecteplase infusion starting with bolus dose of 60 Units/kg IV once (maximum dose of 
5000 Units), followed by 12 Units/kg/hr (patients will only receive one dose of 
tenecteplase in total)
C. For patients who were receiving enoxaparin at time of inclusion, tenecteplase infusion 
can be given immediately. Delay heparin to [ADDRESS_699961] recent enoxaparin 
dose, beginning at an infusion rate of 12 Units/kg/hr. Do not administer a bolus dose of 
heparin.

Protocol ML42492 154.2 METHOD OF T REATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
This trial will be a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial with an escalating-dose 
randomized design. Randomization will be completed as follows:
●Block randomization of 2:1 (treatment:control) in blocks of 15, performed twice 
per dose
●The first block of 15 patients (10 treatment at 0.25 mg/kg dose and 5 placebo 
control) will be assessed for safety trigger by [CONTACT_6802]/CEC within [ADDRESS_699967] treatment; if no safety trigger is 
met (as determined by [CONTACT_394268]/CEC), a second cohort of 15 patients will be 
enrolled (10 at the 0.25 mg/kg dose and 5 placebo control).
●If no safety trigger occurs after 30 patients enrolled (20 at the 0.25 mg/kg dose 
and 10 placebo control) then the first cohort 15 patients will be enrolled at the 
0.50 mg/kg dose with randomization of 2:1 (treatment:placebo control). If no 
safety trigger occurs, the last cohort of 15 patients will be enrolled (10 at the 0.50 
mg/kg dose and 5 placebo control).
●All SAE’s will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6802]/CEC every 15 patients enrolled and 
each death will be reviewed within 72 hrs of reporting. Safety trigger is defined as 
a greater than two patient differential in the occurrence of symptomatic 
intracranial hemorrhage or major acute bleeding event (defined below) within 72 
hours between control and treatment arms.
●Randomization will be stratified according to site. 
Tenecteplase and placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_8229]. They will be labeled accordingly, 
indicating which vials contain active drug and which contain placebo. The DCC research 
pharmacy will de-identify the drugs for distribution to each study center (with tracking of all 
product) and therefore will remain unblinded to treatment randomization and will be in charge of 
assigning the correct vials for dosing. Study staff, investigators, and subjects will remain blinded 
to treatment assignments.

Protocol ML42492 17Patients who use oral contraceptives or maintenance therapy for comorbidities should continue 
their use.
Formal interaction studies of tenecteplase with other drugs have not been performed.  Patients 
studied in clinical trials of tenecteplase were routinely treated with heparin and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  
Anticoagulants (such as heparin and vitamin K antagonists) and drugs that alter platelet function 
(such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and glycoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitors) may increase 
the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after tenecteplase therapy.  
The investigator should consult the prescribing information when determining whether a 
concomitant medication can be safely administered with study treatment.  In addition, the 
investigator should contact [CONTACT_537462].

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.1 SAFETY PLAN
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with tenecteplase in 
completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated important safety risks for tenecteplase are 
outlined below.  Please refer to the Tenecteplase Investigator's Brochure for a complete 
summary of safety information. 
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study.  
Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities.  Patients 
will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the nature, frequency, 
and severity of adverse events.  In addition, guidelines for managing adverse events are 
provided below.
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, including the 
use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of patients during the 
study.  Administration of tenecteplase, and the placebo, will be performed in a monitored setting 
in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment and medicine 
to manage potentially serious reactions.  Refer to Sections 5.2−5.6 for details on safety 
reporting (e.g., adverse events, pregnancies) during the study.
5.1.1 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_537437] 28 day follow up period, enrollment will be halted and 
DSMC/CEC review will be performed within 72 hrs of notification.  The DSMC will then issue a 
report back to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_537438]-opening the study or 
permanently closing the study. 
Should there occur, at any time during the study, a difference between the control and treatment 
cohorts of >2 intracerebral hemorrhages then the study will be halted.  Per protocol, the 
DSMC/CEC will review all ICH’s (SAE’s). Following each of these individual case reviews (after 
analysis/interpretation locked), the DSMC/CEC statistician (who is unblinded, not the study 
statistician, who will remain blinded) will provide summary data on the ICH’s according to 
cohort. If there is a greater than 2 ICH differential then the study will be halted.  Additionally, the 
DSMC/CEC will be reviewing all enrollments, with summary statistics for each cohort (provided 
by [CONTACT_6802]/CEC statistician) after each 15 patients are enrolled. They are empowered to halt 
study enrollment at each of these review points should there be safety concerns. After each of 
these planned DSMC/CEC reviews the DSMC/CEC will generate a formal report to provide to 
the study PI.

be avoided, and internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures should be avoided to 
minimize bleeding from the non-compressible sites.  In the event of serious bleeding, heparin 
and antiplatelet agents should be discontinued immediately and treated appropriately.  Heparin 
effects can be reversed by [CONTACT_537465].
[IP_ADDRESS] Bleeding
The most common complication encountered during tenecteplase therapy is bleeding. This may 
be either superficial from punctures or damaged blood vessels or internal bleeding at any site or 
body cavity.  Bleeding may result in life-threatening situations, permanent disability, or death. 
●The incidence of ICH, especially sICH, in patients with AIS is higher in alteplase-treated 
patients than placebo-treated patients in published studies (for detailed information, see the 
alteplase USPI).
The type of bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy can be divided into two broad 
categories:
●Internal bleeding, involving intracranial and retroperitoneal sites, or the gastrointestinal, 
genitourinary, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_322171]
●Superficial or surface bleeding, observed mainly at vascular puncture and access sites (e.g., 
venous cutdowns, arterial punctures) or sites of recent surgical intervention
Management of Bleeding 
Patients will be excluded for the presence of conditions related to risks of bleeding (as outlined 
in Section 4.1.2  Exclusion Criteria). 
Should an arterial puncture be necessary during the first few hours following tenecteplase 
therapy, the use of an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to manual compression is 
preferable.  Pressure should be applied for at least [ADDRESS_699982] potential risks associated with therapy.
Guidelines for management of patients who develop bleeding are provided in Table 1. 
In addition, any ICH events (symptomatic and/or asymptomatic), if not already reported as an 
SAE by [CONTACT_093], are considered non-serious adverse events of special interest for this 
study (Section 5.2.3) and should be reported and submitted to the Sponsor (Section 5.4 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Arrhythmias
Coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion.  These 
arrhythmias (such as sinus bradycardia, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular 
Effective Date: 6/15/2021
End Date: 12/7/2021

Tenecteplase⎯Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Protocol ML42492 24premature depolarizations, ventricular tachycardia, etc.) are not different from those often seen 
in the ordinary course of AMI and may be managed with standard anti-arrhythmic measures.  It 
is recommended that anti-arrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and ventricular irritability be 
available when tenecteplase is administered.
[IP_ADDRESS] Thromboembolism 
The use of thrombolytics can increase the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with high 
likelihood of left heart thrombus, such as patients with mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cholesterol Embolization
Cholesterol embolism has been reported rarely in patients treated with all types of thrombolytic 
agents; the true incidence is unknown.  This serious condition, which can be lethal, is also 
associated with invasive vascular procedures (e.g., cardiac catheterization, angiography, 
vascular surgery) and/or anticoagulant therapy. Clinical features of cholesterol embolism may 
include livedo reticularis, “purple toe” syndrome, acute renal failure, gangrenous digits, 
hypertension, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, spi[INVESTIGATOR_80557], 
retinal artery occlusion, bowel infarction, and rhabdomyolysis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Use with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
In patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, physicians should choose either 
thrombolysis or PCI as the primary treatment strategy for reperfusion. Rescue PCI if medically 
appropriate or subsequent elective PCI may be performed after administration of thrombolytic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; however, the optimal use of adjunctive antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_537439].
5.1.[ADDRESS_699983] be avoided and internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures should 
be avoided to minimize bleeding from the noncompressible sites. In the event of serious 
bleeding, heparin and antiplatelet agents should be discontinued immediately. Heparin effects 
can be reversed by [CONTACT_537465].
[IP_ADDRESS] Re-administration
Re-administration of plasminogen activators, including tenecteplase, to patients who have 
received prior plasminogen activator therapy has not been systematically studied.  Three of [ADDRESS_699984] results were considered positive for 
antibodies to tenecteplase in a radioimmunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_537440].  Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody 
positivity in an assay may be influenced by [CONTACT_282452], 
concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the 
incidence of antibodies to tenecteplase with the incidence of antibodies to other products may 
be misleading.  Although sustained antibody formation in patients receiving one dose of 
tenecteplase has not been documented, re-administration should be undertaken with caution.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity, including urticarial/anaphylactic reactions, have rarely ( 1%) been reported 
after administration of tenecteplase (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, laryngeal edema, rash, and 
Effective Date: 6/15/2021
End Date: 12/7/2021

Tenecteplase⎯Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Protocol ML42492 25urticaria).  Monitor patients treated with tenecteplase during and for several hours after infusion. 
If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, appropriate therapy should be initiated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Interactions
Formal interaction studies of tenecteplase with other drugs have not been performed. Patients 
studied in clinical trials of tenecteplase were routinely treated with heparin and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  
Anticoagulants (such as direct oral anticoagulants, heparin and vitamin K antagonists) and 
drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and GP IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after tenecteplase 
therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
During tenecteplase therapy, results of coagulation tests and/or measures of fibrinolytic activity 
may be unreliable unless specific precautions are taken to prevent in vitro artifacts.  
Tenecteplase is an enzyme that, when present in blood in pharmacologic concentrations, 
remains active under in vitro conditions.  This can lead to degradation of fibrinogen in blood 
samples removed for analysis.
5.1.4 Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Management Guidelines
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 1.
Table 1 Guidelines for Management of Patients Who Experience Bleeding
Event Action to Be Taken
Bleeding ●In the event of serious bleeding, heparin and antiplatelet 
agents should be discontinued immediately and treated 
appropriately.  Heparin effects can be reversed by 
[CONTACT_537465]. 
●Intramuscular injections and nonessential handling of the 
patient should be avoided for the first few hours following 
treatment with tenecteplase. 
●Venipunctures should be performed and monitored 
carefully.
●Should an arterial puncture be necessary during the first 
few hours following tenecteplase therapy, it is preferable 
to use an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to 
manual compression. Pressure should be applied for at 
least 30 minutes, a pressure dressing applied, and the 
puncture site checked frequently for evidence of bleeding.
Refer to Sections 5.2−5.6 for details on safety reporting (e.g., adverse events, pregnancies) for 
this study.

regardless of attribution.
This includes the following:
●AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol-specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with AMI that were not present 
prior to the AE reporting period.
●Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).
●If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatment run-in, or other protocol-mandated intervention.
●Pre-Existing medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_13655]-specified AE reporting period. 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met:
●It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).
●It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.).
●It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
●It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions).
●It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed 
to the IMP.
●It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656]

of the outcomes listed above).
5.2.[ADDRESS_699986] are required to be reported by [CONTACT_537466] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event).  Non-serious 
adverse events of special interest for this study are as follows:
●Any ICH events (symptomatic and/or asymptomatic), if not already reported as an SAE 
●The non-drug specific AESIs:
Effective Date: 6/15/2021
End Date: 12/7/2021

Tenecteplase⎯Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Protocol ML42492 27●Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law.
●Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below
–Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible 
spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered an 
infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical 
symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a 
medicinal product.  This term applies only when a contamination of the study drug is 
suspected.
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING S AFETY VARIABLES
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study, are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, 
Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports). 
5.3.[ADDRESS_699987] 
administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier.  
After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment.
5.3.[ADDRESS_699988], or other means will be 
reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to tenecteplase 
(see following guidance), and actions taken.
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:
Yes
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of 
tenecteplase, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to 
tenecteplase; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of tenecteplase or dose 
reduction.
No
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than tenecteplase (e.g., preexisting medical 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE 
has no plausible temporal relationship to tenecteplase administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_699989] dose of tenecteplase).
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the 
Package Insert (P.I) or current Investigator Brochure (I.B). 
Effective Date: 6/15/2021
End Date: 12/7/2021

Tenecteplase⎯Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Protocol ML42492 28Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the P.I. or current I.B or not identified.  This 
includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description 
in the P.I. or I.B.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the 
P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each 
protocol-mandated therapy.
5.4 PROCEDURES FOR ELICITING, RECORDING, AND REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS
5.4.1 Data Safety Monitoring/CEC
A Data Safety Monitoring Committee/Clinical Events Committee (DSMC/CEC), compi[INVESTIGATOR_537441] [ADDRESS_699990], will review safety events throughout the trial.  
Review of clinical events will be done in a completely blinded fashion.  Each event will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_537467]/CEC members and if discrepancy exists in their determinations, then 
consensus adjudication will be required.  The committee will meet to review all Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) and unexpected and related Adverse Events (AEs) every 15 patients. For each 
15 patient interval assessment, summary statistics for each cohort will be provided to the 
DSMC/CEC (after completion of all blinded clinical events review).  Following each of these 
individual case reviews (after analysis/interpretation locked), the DSMC/CEC statistician (who is 
unblinded, not the study statistician, who will remain blinded) will provide summary data on the 
ICH’s according to cohort. If there is a greater than 2 ICH differential then the study will be 
halted.  Additionally, the DSMC/CEC will be reviewing all enrollments, with summary statistics 
for each cohort (provided by [CONTACT_6802]/CEC statistician) after each 15 patients are enrolled. 
The DSMC/CEC will review SAEs, both related and unrelated, as well as unexpected and 
related AEs. If a mortality or related serious adverse event occurs, the committee will meet 
within 72hrs of reporting to review. The committee will have the power to recommend a halt in 
study enrollment, should there be a safety concern.
5.4.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse 
event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive questions 
include the following: 
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?" 
5.4.[ADDRESS_699991] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs.  
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable to 
report the information that is currently available.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it 
should be reported as follow-up information.
Effective Date: 6/15/2021
End Date: 12/7/2021

Tenecteplase⎯Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Protocol ML42492 [IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (see Section 5.2.2), 
regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties.  When recording a death, 
the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the 
single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time 
of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history.  A preexisting medical condition should be 
re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of the condition worsens during the study.  When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_13665] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537442].  If a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a 
result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be 
reported as the SAE.  For example, if a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13587], record the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].
●An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26664] a serious adverse event:
●Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33402] (e.g., for study drug administration or 
insertion of access device for study drug administration) 
●Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met:
–The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537443]
–The patient has not experienced an adverse event
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537444] 
a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event instead:
●Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_537445] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v5.0) will be used for assessing 
adverse event severity.  Table 2 will be used for assessing severity for adverse events that are 
not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2.
5.4.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding the 
event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an adverse 
event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The 
following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 3):
●Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
●Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)
●Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
●Known association of the event with the disease under study
●Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase 
the occurrence of the event
●Presence of non-treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event

Protocol ML42492 31Table 3 Causal Attribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YE
SThere is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge.
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below.  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
or concomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_699993] dose of study drug).
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each 
protocol-mandated therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies
If a female patient becomes pregnant while receiving tenecteplase or within 90[ADDRESS_699994] dose of tenecteplase, a report should be completed and expeditiously submitted to 
Genentech, Inc.  Follow-up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy should also occur.  
Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as 
serious, and expeditiously reported to Genentech as an SAE.  Similarly, any congenital 
anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to the tenecteplase should be 
reported to Genentech, Inc.  as an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-Study Adverse Events
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a patient has completed or 
discontinued study participation if attributed to prior tenecteplase exposure.  If the investigator 
should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a subsequently 
conceived offspring of a female patient who participated in the study, this should be reported as 
an SAE.
Case Transmission Verification will be performed by [CONTACT_537468].
CASE TRANSMISSION VERIFICATION OF SINGLE CASE REPORTS

6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
6.1 DETERMINATION OF S AMPLE SIZE
Assuming a total of 60 subjects enrolled with a 2:1 ratio in the tenecteplase:control arms and a 
good outcome rate of 15% in the control arm, this study has approximately 70% power to detect 
an absolute difference of 35% in the good outcome rate between the combined tenecteplase 
arms (40 patients) and the control arm (20 patients) and approximately 55% power to detect an 
absolute difference of 35% between each of the tenecteplase arms (20 patients) and the control 
arm (20 patients), at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level based on the Fisher’s exact test. Good 
outcome rate is defined as the proportion of patients who are alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_537447] 28 days. If the true rate of symptomatic ICH or major bleeding requiring transfusion is 3%, the 
chance of observing at least one of these events in [ADDRESS_700000] 45%. The chance of 
observing at least one event in [ADDRESS_700001] 70% if the true event rate is 6%.
6.2 PRIMARY EFFICACY V ARIABLE
Data will be analyzed according to clinical status at day 28.  Outcome will be the proportion of 
patients who are alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (no use of HFNC, NIPPV, Intubation). All 
other patients, those on HFNC, NIPPPV, or mechanical ventilation, or dead, will be assessed as 
Effective Date: 6/15/2021
End Date: 12/7/2021

Tenecteplase⎯Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
Protocol ML42492 38failures for the purposes of the primary analysis. In the case of missing data, a last carry forward 
methodology will be used. 
6.3 PRIMARY SAFETY VARIABLE
Data will be analyzed according to the occurrence, at any time between tenecteplase 
administration and day 28, of intracranial hemorrhage or major bleeding event (defined above).  
Outcome will be the proportion of patients who have suffered no intracranial hemorrhage or 
major bleeding event. Those patients who have suffered an intracranial hemorrhage or major 
bleeding event will be assessed as failures for the purposes of the safety analysis. 
6.4 ONGOING S AFETY ANALYSIS
Should there occur, at any time during the study, a difference between the control and treatment 
cohorts of >2 intracerebral hemorrhages then the study will be halted.  Per protocol, the 
DSMC/CEC will review all ICH’s (SAE’s). Following each of these individual case reviews (after 
analysis/interpretation locked), the DSMC/CEC statistician (who is unblinded, not the study 
statistician, who will remain blinded) will provide summary data on the ICH’s according to 
cohort. If there is a greater than 2 ICH differential then the study will be halted.  Additionally, the 
DSMC/CEC will be reviewing all enrollments, with summary statistics for each cohort (provided 
by [CONTACT_6802]/CEC statistician) after each 15 patients are enrolled. They are empowered to halt 
study enrollment at each of these review points should there be safety concerns. After each of 
these planned DSMC/CEC reviews the DSMC/CEC will generate a formal report to provide to 
the study PI.  
6.[ADDRESS_700002] deviations and frequencies with percentages respectively. Tukey’s method for pairwise 
comparison and large sample based multiple comparison of logits will be performed for 
continuous variables. Logistic regression modeling will be used for covariates adjustments and 
subgroup analyses. Survival functions will be estimated by [CONTACT_537472]-Meier method. 
Statistical testing will be performed at two-sided 5% level of significance.
7. INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS
7.1 RETENTION OF RECORDS
FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) and the ICH Guideline for GCP (see Section 4.9 of the 
guideline) require that records and documents pertaining to the conduct of clinical trials and the

Protocol ML42492 397.[ADDRESS_700004], data, and safety of this study to ensure 
that:
●Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9480]/or response are met,
●Risk/benefit ratio is not altered to the detriment of the patients,
●Appropriate internal monitoring of AEs and outcomes is done,
●Over-accrual does not occur,
●Under-accrual is addressed with appropriate amendments or actions, and
● Data are being appropriately collected in a reasonably timely manner.
Routine monitoring will be carried out via a periodic team conference among investigators 
during which toxicity data, including all SAEs, will be reviewed and other issues relevant to the 
study such as interim assessment of accrual, outcome, and compliance with study guidelines, 
will be discussed.  Monitoring will be carried out on an ongoing basis.  The severity, 
relatedness, and whether or not the event is expected will be reviewed.
7.3 STUDY MEDICATION ACCOUNTABILITY 
The Sponsor Investigator of the study will ensure maintenance of complete and accurate 
records of the receipt, dispensation, and disposal or return of all study drug in accordance with 
21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 312.[ADDRESS_700005] 
is completed in a legible and timely manner for every patient enrolled in the study, and that data 
are recorded on the appropriate forms and in a timely manner.  Any errors on source 
data should be lined through, but not obliterated, with the correction inserted, initialed, and 
dated by [CONTACT_83169].  All source documents will be available for inspection by 
[CONTACT_537473].
7.5 DATA MONITORING
The entire study will be conducted using an electronic data acquisition method where all clinical 
data on enrolled subjects will be data entered (single-keyed) by [CONTACT_449038] a web-
based data management system, REDCap. In order to provide user-friendly and easy-to-
navigate interfaces, the REDCap data capture screens are designed based upon individual 
CRFs. Prior to study start, the system is validated to ensure the data entry screens mirror the 
CRFs and that the pre- programmed data rules appropriately detect incorrect data. The data will 
be managed after data entry via data queries from the study monitor. Monitoring will be 
conducted in real time, allowing for early identification of adverse events and protocol

8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Patients who comply with the requirements of the protocol, are tolerating study treatment, and 
may be receiving benefit will be offered dosing beyond Cycle 1 at the investigator’s discretion 
after a careful assessment and thorough discussion of the potential risks and benefits of 
continued treatment with the patient.  Such patients may have the option to receive 
MPDL3280A treatment as long as they continue to experience clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_537448], symptomatic deterioration attributed to 
disease progression, or any of the other reasons for treatment discontinuation listed in 
Section 4.6.
8.[ADDRESS_700006] be signed by [CONTACT_12718]’s legally 
authorized representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history for each 
patient shall document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  A 
copy of the informed consent document must be provided to the patient or the patient's legally 
authorized representative.  If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local 
language.
Signed consent forms must remain in each patient’s study file and must be available for 
verification by [CONTACT_9534].
8.[ADDRESS_700007] also keep the IRB 
informed of any significant AEs.
Investigators are required to promptly notify their respective IRB of all adverse drug reactions 
that are both serious and unexpected.  This generally refers to SAEs that are not already 
identified in the Investigator’s Brochure and that are considered possibly or probably related to 
the tenecteplase or study drug by [CONTACT_093].  Some IRBs may have other specific AE 
requirements to which investigators are expected to adhere.  Investigators must immediately 
forward to their IRB any written safety report or update provided by [CONTACT_8229] (e.g., IND safety 
report, Investigator’s Brochure, safety amendments and updates, etc.).

Study 
Objective(s) Evaluate the effectiveness of [LOCATION_011] Scientific  (BSC) ’s LV MSP ( Left 
Ventricular MultiSite Pacing ) feature in the Resonate  family of CRT -D 
devices1 and confirm safety in a post approval study when used in 
accordance with its approved labeling.    
Planned 
Indication(s) for 
Use  The BSC Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT -Ds) 
are indicated for patients with heart failure who receive stable optimal 
pharmacologic therapy (OPT) for heart failure and who meet any one of 
the following classifications:  
• Moderate to severe hear t failure (NYHA Class III -IV) with EF ≤ 
35% and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms  
• Left bundle branch block (LBBB) with QRS duration ≥ 130 ms, 
EF ≤ 30%, and mild (NYHA Class II) ischemic or non- ischemic 
heart failure or asymptomatic (NYHA Class I) ischemic heart 
failure   
The LV MSP is a feature of the BSC’s Resonate family of CRT -D 
devices and is intended for use with subjects who are non- responders to 
conventional Biventricular (BiV) CRT -D therapy. The CRT -D device and 
the LV MSP f eature will be used within the current BSC labeled 
indications for CRT -D therapy.

  4. Introduction  
Heart failure may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_338639].  
This delay in conduction, evidenced by a wide QRS pattern on an ECG, results in an 
inefficient asy nchronous contraction pattern. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is the 
application of electrical stimuli to both ventricles with an implanted device.   
Cardiac resynchronization therapy, when combined with defibrillation (CRT -D), was f irst 
demonstrated to improve cardiac function for ICD patients with NYHA Class III -IV heart 
failure, reduced ejection fraction, and wide QRS duration  in the CONTAK CD study1. 
Subsequently, t he COMPANION study demonstrated additional benefits of CRT that 
included reduction in all- cause mortality, both alone and in combination with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864795] -causes, cardiovascular causes, or heart failure2. The study of CRT -D was extended 
in the MADIT CRT trial to ICD patients in NYHA Class I- II3. In addition to the benefits 
shown in previous studies, MADIT CRT also demonstrated significant reduction in left 
ventricular volumes and improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF) . 
The benefits of CRT -D are not conferred on every patient impl anted with a device, however.  
Patients who fail to show improvement are typi[INVESTIGATOR_864796] “non -responders”. There is 
no universally accepted  metric for defining response. Commonly used outcome measures in 
clinical practice include symptomatic relie f, quality of life, or exercise tolerance.  
Improvements in echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular dimensions/volumes and left 
ventricular ejecti on fraction) may also be used. Large scale clinical trials tend to use 
composite endpoints, of which the Clinical Composite Score  (CCS ) first described by [CONTACT_864823]4. This endpoint combines four metrics: all -cause mortality, 
heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], NYHA Class, and quality of life  as measured with the patient  
global assessment instrument. When clinical metrics are used, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_15385] -response rate 
cited is around 30% of  the patients. When echo -based measures are used, the non -response 
rate is higher and around 50% . 
The potential reasons for non- response are varied and include5: 
• Poor lead location  
• Lack of baseline dys synchrony 
• Improper programming  
• Irreversibly advanced heart failure  
• Myocardial scar  
Device -based features have been introduced that modify how CRT is delivered.  These 
include:  
• Interventricular timing (V -V timing)   
• AV Delay  
• LV-only CRT  
• Multi -site pacing

V-V Timing : The InSync III Marquis Study6 using the CCS , DECREASE HF Study7 using a 
composite of peak VO 2 and LVESD, and RHYTHM ICD V -V Optimization Study8 using 
peak VO 2 all demonstrated the safety of this feature and non- inferio rity to conventional 
sequential biventricular pacing, but none showed superiority. 
LV Only CRT : The DECREASE HF Study7 using a composite of peak VO 2 and LVESD and 
the B -LEFT HF Study9 using the CCS  demonstrated safety of LV pacing . The AdaptivCRT 
study10, using the CCS , evaluated an algorithm that provided either LV or biventricular 
pacing depending on AV conduction while also periodic ally adjusting AV delay and V -V 
timing. This algorithm was found to be non -inferior to echocardiographic -guided 
optimization. Overall, the results from these studies showed that the LV only pacing is as 
effective as conventional BiV CRT pacing. 
AV Delay : Randomized studies to determine the effectiveness of optimizing AV delay have 
been based on algorithms that use measurements of intrinsic conduction to establish an AV 
delay. These studies include FREEDOM11 (which also included a V -V tim ing optimization 
algorith m), which used the CCS , and SMART -AV12, which used LVESV to measure 
effectiveness of optimizing AV delay. Both studies  showed that these methods were non-
inferior to empi[INVESTIGATOR_338621]. The RESPOND -CRT study13, which evaluated a CRT 
system that employed a hemodynamic sensor to optimize both AV and VV timing, used a 
modified version of the CCS . This study also found that the sensor was non- inferior to 
echocardiographic optimization.  
Multi- site Pacing : Left ventricular multi- site pacing (MSP) has emerged as an option for 
addressing the non -responder issue with conventional CRT by [CONTACT_2329] a quadripo lar lead to 
pace two sites within the same coronary vein. Studies have shown that MSP improved acute 
hemodynamics and ventricular synchrony, and resulted in faster activation of myocardium 
and improved clinical responses as measured by [CONTACT_864825]14-22. Furthermore, acute studies on MSP 
have shown no ventricular arrhythmias or other adverse events during acute testing, implant 
and pre -discharge18. Among different MSP configurations discussed in the literature, paci ng 
from two sites that are farthest apart (distal to proximal) was the most common optimal 
configuration as it may recruit a larger area of the myocardium with late activation to achieve 
better ventricular synchrony15, 19. Opting for the two pacing sites that are farthest apart may 
provide a simple means for pacing  vector selection in MSP, in combination with the 
evaluation of pacing threshold and impedance, and the avoidance of the phrenic nerve 
stimulation (PNS).   
The MPP Trial23, using a modified version of the CCS , evaluated a CRT -D system that paced 
the left ventricle from two distinct sites using a quadripolar lead . The study had a 3 month 
run-in phase that identified non -responders who were then randomiz ed to MPP or 
conventional CRT. The MPP Trial provided safety data of the MPP feature. The MPP 
therapy  was found to be non- inferior to conventional CRT in converting non- responders to 
responders.

  [LOCATION_011] Scient ific’s Left Ventricular Multi -Site Pacing (LV MSP) is intended to improve the 
cardiac resynchronization therapy response by [CONTACT_864826]. It provides physicians a new set of tools that allow for 
individualized patient therapy with the goal of improving clinical response in non-responders  
to conventional CRT therapy. The objective of SMART MSP study is to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the LV MSP feature to improve CRT non- response rate and confirm the 
safety of the feature in the post -market settings .

  pacing . Each of the LV paces has its own independently programmable pacing vector and 
output (LVa vector and LVb  vector ). Depending on the pacing chamber selected, the LV 
MSP feature can deliver BiV MSP pacing or LV Only MSP pacing .  
Two features associated with the LV MSP are described below:  
[IP_ADDRESS].  SmartVector  
The SmartVector feature provides recommendations for the LV MSP pacing sequence, LV 
pacing vectors and LV pacing characteristics (amplitude and pulse width) based on data 
gathered via the LV Vecto rGuide feature and on LV electrode spacing.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  SmartOffset  
The SmartOffset feature provides recommendations for the LV MSP programmed delays 
between the ventricular paces based on data gathered via the LV VectorGuide data and the  
current LV MSP pacing vectors . 
5.1.2. LV Only Pacing   
Another  new feat ure available in these CRT -D devices is the LV only pacing feature. The 
clinician can program Pacing Chamber settings so that the system delivers CRT pacing 
therapy to both ventricu lar chambers (BiV Pacing) or just to the lef t ventricular chamber (LV 
Only).    
5.1.3. LV VectorGuide™  
The LV VectorGuide allows the clinician to quickly evaluate multiple quadripolar LV pacing 
vectors to identify the desired configuration. The following tests can be assessed in each 
pacing configuration from the LV VectorGuide screen.  
• RV sense (RVs) to LV sense (LVs) timing  
• LV lead impedance  
• Phrenic Nerve Stimulation (PNS)  
• LV pace threshold  
The LV VectorGuide feature is available in previous generations  of BSC CRT -D devices. 
5.1.4. SmartDelay™  
The SmartDelay o ptimization feature provides recommended settings for programming the 
paced and sensed AV Delay based on the measurem ent of intrinsic AV intervals. The 
objective of the feature is to recommend AV delays that provide optimally timed CRT, which 
maximizes cardiac contractile function. The AV delay optimization provided by [CONTACT_864827] . 
The SmartDelay feature is ava ilable in previous generations  of BSC CRT -D devices .

  5.2. ACUITYTM X4 Quadripolar Cor onary Venous LV Lead  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific’s  ACUITY™ X4 heart failure lead family for the Left Ventricle (LV)  
quadripolar leads is  required in this study. The ACUITYTM X4 leads are intended for chronic 
left ventricular pacing and sensing. A variety of pace/sen se configurations  are possible with 
the four electrodes that can function as cathodes (all four electrodes) or anodes (all except 
E1, the most distal electrode) when used with a compatible pulse generator. ACUITYTM X4 
leads are available in three tip configuration designs (straight tip, short tip spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585], long tip 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585])— intended to provide choices for  a variety of patient anatomies.  
The ACUITY™ X4 LV lead models are required to be used in this study but they are no t 
under evaluation. 
See Figure 5.2-1 and  Figure 5.2- 2 for images of the ACUITYTM X4 leads and the layout and 
spacing of the electrodes on the lead .

The nomenclature of the electrodes on the LV lead (E1, E2, E3, E4) is an industry standard. 
The corresponding nomenclature on the BSC PRM is as follows: LVTip1, LVRing2, 
LVRing3, and LVRing4.

8.2. Treatment Assignment  
All enrolled subjects will be programmed to conventional CRT from the point of enrollment 
visit to the 6 Month Visit . At the 6 Month Visit , the clinical composite score (CCS) will be 
calculated  for each subject to determine the subject’s respond er status to conventional CRT. 
Subjects who are responders will be in the Responder Group and complete the study  at the [ADDRESS_1206143] 93% of LV pacing are classified in the LV MSP Group , 
which is defined as meeting all of the following criteria:  
• Subjects who have  achieved at least 2 viable LV pacing vectors   
• Subjects who have the LV  MSP feature enabled  
• Subjects who have achieved at least 93%  of the LV MSP pacing   
To determine whether an LV pacing vector  is considered viable , the following criteria  are 
recommended : 
• The p acing impedance is not out -of-range  per physician’s  programmed va lue 
• No presence of PNS  - the pacing capture threshold (PCT) plus 3V of safety margin  
should be less than PNS threshold  
• LV PCT  at ≤ 4.5V or demonstrated capture at ≤ 4.5V

11.5.1. Definition and Components of the Clinical Composite Score  
The CCS  will be calculate d for all subjects at the 6 Month Visit. The CCS c onsists of the 
following components:  
• All-cause mortality  
• Heart Failure (HF) event  
• Patient Global Assessment (PGA)  
• NYHA class  
[IP_ADDRESS].  HF Event Definition  
For the purpose of the CCS calculation , HF event is defined as an adverse event with a 
primary cause of HF and either of the conditions below is met:  
• Subject is admitted and discharged with a calendar date change. 
• Subject is not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338630], inotropes, vasodilators, other parenteral therapy, or aquapheresis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  PGA Classification  
Interpretation of no change status in PGA is defined as the following:  
• A little better, no  change, and a little worse.  
Per CCS definition, a  little better and a  little worse are considered placebo effect and are 
treated as no change  in PGA status .  
The investigator will use the subject’ s response to the PGA and classify response of “a little 
better”, “no change”, or “a little worse” to the category of “no change”. Subsequently, the 
investigator will use “very much better”, “much better”, “no change”, “much worse”, and 
“very much worse”  to determine the status of PGA changes. 
See Table 11.5- 1 for a detailed description of the PGA assessment tool.

  [IP_ADDRESS].  CCS Status Classification  
Subject s will be classified  as improved, unchanged, or worse ned by [CONTACT_864833] . At the 6 Month Visit,  subjects’ status will be 
compared to their status immediately prior to receiving the CRT -D implantation . The 
following criteria  will be used :  
• Improved: Subjects are considered imp roved if they experienced a favorable change 
in at least one NYHA functiona l class or in the PGA  (or both) while remaining alive 
and free of HF event comparing to their status in the Enrollment V isit. See Table 
11.5- 1 on sele cting improved PGA status. 
• Worsened: Subjects are considered worsened if any of the followings occurs:  
o died (from any cause) or  
o experienced an HF event or  
o reported worsening of at least one  NYHA functional class or  
o reported worsening of  the PGA comparing to their status immediately prior to 
receiving the CRT -D implantation . See Table 11.5- 1 on selecting worsened 
PGA status.  
• Unchanged: Subjects  are considered unchanged if they are neither improved nor 
worse ned. 
11.5.2. NYHA Class  
NYHA Class assessment shall be performed by a site staff who is blinded to the study 
design, subject’s clinical status in the study, and the programmed device settings. The 
subject’s current NYHA Class must be determined based on Table 11.4- 1.  
11.5.3. Patient Global Assessment  
The current PGA  must be  filled out by [CONTACT_423] , as specified in the assessment tool in 
Table 11.5- 1. 
11.5.4. Physician Global Assessment  
The current Physician Global Assessment (PhGA) will be fil led out by  [CONTACT_1275]/delegated site staff  based on the evaluation of  the subject’s status from multiple 
clinical aspects. A comparison of the assessment tool for the PGA and PhGA is shown  in

11.5.11. SmartDelay Test  
It is required to perform the SmartDelay test for all subjects to obtain programming 
recommendations for the AV Delay and Pacing Chamber. It is per the investigator discretion 
whether to follow the programming recommendations. However, the Pacing Chamber that is 
selected for a subject at the Enrollment Visit must be used for that subject through the 6 
Month Visit (all subject s) or through the 12 Month Visits (for non- responders). For subjects 
in the Responder Group, there is no requirement to keep the same Pacing Chamber as these 
subjects are completing the study at the end of the [ADDRESS_1206169]. For non-
responders, it is recommended that the LV pacing vector is set to a viable vector (from the 
LV VectorGuide test) with the longest RV -LV delay before running the SmartDelay test.   
The SmartDelay test nominal Temporary Paced Lower Rate Limit ( LRL ) is set at [ADDRESS_1206170]’s intrinsic heart rate before 
conducting the SmartDelay test.  
The following values from the SmartDelay test are required  to be collected:

For the purpose of the CCS calculation, HF event is defined as an adverse event with a 
primary cause of HF and either of the conditions below is met:  
• Subject is admitted and discharged with a calendar date change.  
• Subject is not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338630], inotropes, vasodilators, other parentera l therapy, or aquapheresis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  PGA Classification  
Interpretation of no change status in PGA is defined as the following:  
• A little better, no change, and a little worse.  
Per CCS definition, a little better and a little worse are considered as placebo effect and are 
treated as no change.  
The investigator will use the subject’s response to the PGA and classify response of “a little 
better”, “no change”, or “a little worse” to the category of “no change”. Subsequently, the 
investigator will use “very much better ”, “much better”, “no change”, “much worse”, and 
“very much worse” to determine the status of PGA changes. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  NYHA Class Assessment  
See Section 11.4.4 for a detailed description of performing NYHA Class assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  CCS Status Classification  
Subjects will be classified as improved, unchanged, or worsened by [CONTACT_864838]. At the 12 Month Visit, subjects’ status will be 
compared to their status at the 6 Month Visit. The following criteria will be used :  
• Improved: Subjects are considered improved if they experienced a favorable change 
in at least one NYHA functional class or in the PGA  (or both) while remaining alive 
and free of HF event comparing to their status in the 6 Month Visit . See Table 11.5- 1 
on selecting improved PGA status. 
• Worsened: Subjects are considered worsened if any of the followings occurs:  
o died (from any cause) or  
o experienced a HF event or  
o reported worsening of at least one NYHA functional class or

The SMART MSP PAS study’s Primary Effectiveness Endpoint wil l be analyzed when the 
last 12 Month V isit is completed by [CONTACT_864843]. Subjects eli gible for 
this analysis include  all non- responder subjects who meet the definition of the LV MSP 
Group. The LV MSP Group subjects’ CCS data (NYHA class, HF event , all-cause mortality, 
and patient  global assessment) wil l be collected at the 6 and 12 Month V isit and contribute to 
the endpoint analysis. The LV MSP Group subjects with the LV MSP on for less than 6 
month duration will be included in the analysis . 
The 95% one -sided lower pointwise confi dence limit of the response rate will be calculated 
using the one -sided exact methodology for a single binomial proportion and compared to the 
performance goal of 5%. If the lower confidence limit exceeds the performance goal, then the

19.2. Risks Associated with the Study Device(s)  
There are no additional  risks associated with the stu dy devices beyond those already 
described for  BSC commercially approved and market avai lable CRT -D devices  with the LV 
MSP feature . 
19.3. Risks associated with Participation in the Clinical Study  
All subjects have previously receive d a CRT -D device  implant ation  as part of standard of 
care tr eatment. The study procedure starts at the Enrollment Visit , which is after device 
implant, and at the regularly schedule d standard of care follow -up visits .  
In the S MART MSP study, a subset of the subjects in the Non-Responder Group 
(approximately 110 subjects) will receive the LV MSP therapy from the [ADDRESS_1206202]’s heart rate and loss of AV 
synchrony due to VVI pacing during the Smart Delay test and RVp -LVs interval test. In rare 
cases, subjects may experience temporary symptoms of fatigue, chest discomfort, dyspnea, 
cough, confusion, presyncope, or syncope during these tests. The investigator may stop the 
test if  the subject does not tolerate  the testing procedure .

19.5. Anticipated Benefits  
There may be no benefit to the subject. However, subjects participating in clinical studies 
may have better outcomes than the general population . The subject may benefit from closer 
device follow up due to the clinical protocol schedule. Subjects may be followed more 
carefully and t heir status, as well as their device  and lead status, is checked by [CONTACT_864849]: i nvestigators, data coordinators, monitors and automatic warning 
systems in the clinical study database set to monitor the data as it is submitted to [LOCATION_011] 
Scientific.  
19.6. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
The risks involved with subject participation in this study ar e the same as those for patients 
not participating in the study . The LV MSP feature will only be turned on in the study for 
subjects who are determined to be non -responders to conventional CRT therapy as defined in 
the protocol  and may be turned off per ph ysician discretion . Physicians should consider 
turning the LV MSP feature off if a subject’s HF condition worsens. This study is designed 
to evaluate whether the LV MSP feature can improve clinical response to CRT in subjects 
who are not responders to conventional CRT .   
20. Safety Reporting  
20.1. Reportable Events by [CONTACT_113648] S ite to BSC 
The communication requirements for reporting adverse events, device deficiencies, failures,  
malfunctions, and product nonconformities to BSC are listed in Table 20.4- 1. Adverse 
events must always be reported through the e DC system for SMART MSP Study . However, 
in cases  where the eDC is not available, report the adverse event to BSC using 
[EMAIL_16350] . It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess and 
report  all reportable events in the following categories : 
• All S erious Adverse Events  
• All Heart Failure and Cardiac related Adverse Events  requiring IV or invasive 
therapy , including new onset of cardiac events, or worsening in severity or frequency 
of pre -existing condition(s)  
• All Adverse Device Effects 
o Events listed in the arrhythmia logbook should be reported only if determined 
to be clinical ly significant by [CONTACT_1755]/or delegated site staff (such 
events include ATR, PMT, etc.)

lead testing. 
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects/Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects 
Adverse event collection begins after th e subject signs the informed consent. Events which 
occur prior to the signing of the informed consent form, and per the investigator/delegated 
site staff are a result of the device implant procedure should not be reported. Even if such 
event requires a treatment that is executed after the in formed consent is signed. (e.g. 
hematoma that requires intervention is not an adverse event as long as it does not worsen 
after consenting; infection at the incision site is not an adverse event as long as it does not 
worsen after consenting; planned medical procedure or lead revisions are not adverse event 
as long as the event is id entified prior to the consent). These are considered preexisting 
conditions and are not reportable . If the event worsens after consenting and  meets criteria for 
a reportable event then they must be reported (e.g. hematoma that is worsened and requires 
intervention; a new infection at the incision site or an infection that is worsened and requires 
intervention). If the study subject is consented  while still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864814], and an event occurs which meets the definition of an SAE, the event must be 
reported.  
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of 
individual symptoms. Mult iple symptoms related to a single medical diagnosis should be 
report ed within one (1) adverse event with one (1) event term  (i.e. shortness of breath and 
edema are related to a diagnosis of ‘worsening heart failure’).  
If it is unclear whether or not an eve nt fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device or testing procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event 
and/or device deficiency. 
Any AE required by [CONTACT_760] , experienced by [CONTACT_864850] , 
and once considered enrolled in the study must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Death should not be recorded as an AE, but should only be reflected as an outcome of one  (1) 
specific SAE (see Section 20.2 for AE definitions).  
Refer to Section 19  for the known risks associated with the study device(s).

of similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investiga tional device or 
the procedures;  
- the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if 
the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible; 
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the re duction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;

were relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also 
be classified as possible.  
Probably Related  The relationship with the use of the investigational device seems relevant and/or the 
event cannot reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may 
be obtained.  
Causal Relationship  The serious event is associated with the investigational device or with procedures 
beyond reasonable doubt when: 
- the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of 
similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has a temporal relationship with investigational device use/application or 
procedures;  
- the event involves a body -site or organ that  
o the investigational device or procedure s are applied to;  
o the investigational device or procedures have an effect on;  
- the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known); 
- the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible);  
- other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ c linical condition 
or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;

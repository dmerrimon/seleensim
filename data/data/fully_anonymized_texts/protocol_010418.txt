3 of 17   
Category 1 :  Education (the following criteria must be met) 
 Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings and specifically 
involves normal educational practices that are NOT  likely to adversely impact students’ opportunity to 
learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.   
 
Category 2 :  Interactions (the following criteria must be met)  
 Research that includes only interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) 
[ADDRESS_506969] be met: 
 
  2i) The information obtained is recorded by [CONTACT_120816] a manner that the identity of  
      the human subjects CANNOT  readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the   
      subjects  
 
OR  
 
  2ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects’ responses outside the research would NOT   
       reasonably* place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects’  
       financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation 
 
*Reasonably defined as with fair and sound judgment; a standard used by [CONTACT_402336], rational 
person under similar circumstances.  
 
Category 3 i:  Behavioral Interventions (All  of the following criteria must be met)  
 The research involves behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the 
subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection 
 The behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely 
to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think 
the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing.   Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and 
someone else.

SECTION 3: WHAT IS YOUR RESEARCH QUESTION?  
 
1. State the hypothesis or primary objective of the research. Include a rationale for conducting the 
study.  [Maximum length = 250 WORDS]     
This study seeks to utilize our previously tested Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE) online 
community intervention to connect peer leaders with healthcare personnel and frontline essential workers 
choosing not to receive the COVID-[ADDRESS_506971]-effective platform for scaling these models. Our research team has employed our HOPE intervention 
previously , for example, in populations who are high risk for HIV/AIDS and in populations suffering from 
anxiety due to COVID -19. Following that same model, we will modify it to help combat the current low 
rates of COVID -19 vaccination, with some places experiencing as high as 50% of healthcare personnel 
refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. If we are able to increase the rates of COVID-19 vaccination, it 
will show potential as a useful tool to aid in future public heal th crises and vaccination campaigns.  
2. COVID -19: Does this research include a focus on SARS -CoV-2/COVID -19 (Coronavirus)?  
   NO   
 
   YES: Please consider whether Ancillary Committees for COVID -19 Research  apply.

 Those who do not qualify to participate in the study will see a web page that thanks them for their interest and tells them that they are not qualified to participate at this time and that their data will not be used and will 
be destroyed to protect their confidentiality . Those who are unqualified will not be able to access the 
Informed Consent Information Sheet. If eligible, potential participants will be sent a brief description of the 
study and the Informed Consent Information Sheet. If they would like to participate in the study they will be 
asked to continue with the consent process. By [CONTACT_402339], they will have implied consent to the study 
and be routed to a webpage where they can provide an email address and phone number for future contact, as well as begin the baseline survey. After survey completion, they will be instructed to friend request our HOPE Study  Facebook profile or be provided a link to join the group. 
 
After 1) consenting to the study (by [CONTACT_402339]), 2) friending us on Facebook, 3) completing a baseline 
survey, and 4) joining our  private Facebook group  (they will be randomly assigned to a group and group 
request will be sent to them ), participants will be officially enrolled in the study.

ncov/vaccines/recommendations.html  
 
As this is a time -sensitive study, peer leaders might be enrolled based on these criteria; however, if time 
permits, they might also be called and secondarily screened to see whether they are social, communicative, 
and seem to have leadership qualities based on things like past volunteer experiences. Enrolled peer leaders will be asked to participate in [ADDRESS_506976] with participants. Session 1 will focus on COVID -19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]; session 2 on 
benefits of the vaccine, as well as fears and myths surrounding the vaccine, and session 3 on the logistics of 
the study. Peer leaders who complete the training will be paid $20 per week in Amazon gift cards for 
emailing us a tracking form by [CONTACT_402340].  Methods: Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group (each group will have 
approximately 30 participants and approximately 6 peer leaders (depending on recruitment and people that 
may drop out)). There will be [ADDRESS_506977] messages to participants, attempting to promote COVID-19 vaccination through comforting and 
educational information/content of their choice. Every 2 weeks through the end of the study, participants in 
both conditions will be invited to email us to receive information about and receive related resources for 
COVID -19 vaccination, such as pamphlet on vaccination information. At the end of the 4-week intervention, 
participants will complete the final survey. Participants will be paid $15 in Amazon gift cards for the baseline 
survey, $20 in Amazon gift cards for the final survey , and $[ADDRESS_506978] about 4- 6 weeks after completing respective tasks 
before receiving compensation. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_103825]/or email to remind them to complete surveys  as discussed above for the baseline survey.  
 All analyses wil l be conduc ted in R (version 4.1.2) We will assess the effect of the HOPE intervention on the 
primary outcome (whether a participant requested vaccine information during the study), and the secondary outcome (whether a participant got the vaccine during the study). We will adjust  for race (dichotomized by 
[CONTACT_402341]), age (above vs. below 40), sex from birth, education (bachelor or below vs. grad school or above), and ethnicity (Latino vs. other). The intervention effect on the primary outcome w ill be assessed using logistic mixed effects models or 
generalized estimating equations .  
The intervention effect on the secondary outcome w ill be assessed using generalized estimating equations 
with an exchangeable correlation structure ([2]), which accounts for the clustering by [CONTACT_402342]. Engagement in the study is  defined as participants that posted, commented, voted, or reacted to anything 
within a given week.  
 
 
SECTION 6: PARTICIPANT COMPENSATION

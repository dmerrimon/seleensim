subsequent timepoints  
 
Study Design  This is a 1-year open -label study (OLS ) following the randomized 
double -blind placebo -controlled  Phase 3 studies . De novo  participants 
(adjunctive ADT or monotherapy) who have not been part of prior Phase 
3 studies with REL -1017 may also be enrolled. Participant s in the OLS 
from REL -1017 -301 or REL -1017 -302 will continue to take their 
prescribed ADT plus REL -1017.  Participants from REL -1017 -303 will 
continue to refrain from use of concomitant ADT.  
All participants who complete the REL -1017 Phase 3 studie s without any 
safety issues that would preclude participation in this OLS (according to 
the Investigator ) are eligible.  
Investigational 
Product/Reference 
Product  REL -1017  25 mg tablet s 
Study Drug, Dose 
Schedule, and Mode of 
Administration  REL -1017 25  mg tablet s once daily ( QD) for oral administration (PO)  
for up to [ADDRESS_173553] therapy participants . 
The following loading dose schedule will be used for de novo  participants 
only:   

Day 1 – loading dose:   
• Three REL -1017 25 mg  tablets  (75 mg  total)  administered at the 
clinical  study  site

Statistical Data Analysis  Study analysis populations , defined as follows : 
Screened /Enrolled  Set: The Screened /Enrolled  Set will include all 
participant s who sign ed an informed consent.  
Full Analysis Set  (FAS) : All participant s who received at least [ADDRESS_173563] -Baseline 
efficacy assessment , irrespective of any deviation from the protocol 
or premature discontinuation . The FAS will be used for analysis of 
efficacy.  
Safety Set : All participant s who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug in the OLS.  This population will be used for the analysis of 
safety.  
Safety data analysis  
Descriptive statistics  of the safety and efficacy of the participant s in the 
OLS will be presented based on the prior double -blind treatment groups: 
Double -blind place bo, double -blind REL -1017, de novo .  In general, the 
Baseline for each assessment will be the last value collected prior to the 
first open -label dose.  
Summaries of efficacy results will be presented for the FAS, and 
summaries of safety results will be presented for the Safety Set ; all will be 
summarized  by [CONTACT_150227] “REL -1017 in double -blind study, ” 
“placebo in double -blind study, ” “de novo ,” “pooled placebo and de 
novo ,” and “overall ”. 
Continuous safety and tolerability assessments (e .g., vital signs, weight,  
BMI,  body temperature, ECG parameters, and laboratory parameters) will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics for values for each visit, and 
additionally for change from Baseline of OLS.  
The time course of absolute values and change from Baseline  will be 
presented in descriptive statistics and figures.   
Categorical safety data (e .g., categorical laboratory parameters, ECG 
overall evaluation, QT/QTcF categories) and central tendency effects will 
be presented by [CONTACT_150228] s in the respective 
category for each visit.  
The number and percentage of participant s with TEAEs , serious adverse 
events (SAEs) , AEs associated with discontinuation, and TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_150229], using the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 . 
All summaries of TEAEs will be provided for the TEAEs in OLS ( i.e., 
AEs that started or worsened in severity after first dose in the OLS ). 
Comorbidities and comedications will be summarized in count and 
frequency tables . 
Exploratory Efficacy variables  
Continuous efficacy variables will be reported using descriptive statistics 
for values for each visit, and additionally for change from Baseline  of 
OLS . The time course of absolute values and change from Baseline  will 
be presented in figures.   
Categorical efficacy data will be presented by [CONTACT_150230] s in the respective category for each visit.

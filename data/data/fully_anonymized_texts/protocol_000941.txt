Original Protocol  04 Nov 2021  
 
Amendment 2,  16 Aug 2022 : Current Amendment  
This amendment is considered to be substantial  based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union . 
Main Rationale for the Amendment : 
The purpose of this amendment is to remove the Phase 2 expansion part of this study , which is 
now planned as part of  a future Phase 2/3  trial. As originally planned, the Sponsor will use safety 
and immunogenicity data from the ~[ADDRESS_788923] a dose level for Phase 2/3. The 
Phase 2 expansion part was initially planned to  provide additional safety data with potential 
immunogenicity assessment at a later time. The Sponsor considers the data from 550 participants 
in mRNA -1073 -P101 , 729 participants who received mRNA -1010 in Study mRNA -1010 -P101,  
approximately 1700 participan ts who received  mRNA -1010 in Study mRNA -1010 -P301 (as of 
16 Aug 2022) , and an estimated total of 661,128,345 doses of mRNA -1273 administered (as of 
15 Jun 2022) to be supportive of advancement to Phase 2/3. The final analysis of all endpoints 
will be performed after all participants in the revised Phase 1 /[ADDRESS_788924] completed 
Day 181/End of Study (EoS).  
The summary of changes table provided below describes the major changes made in Amendment 
2 compared to Amendment 1, including the sections modified and the corresponding rationales.

Confidential  Page 10 Background and Rationale for Study:  
ModernaTX, Inc. (the Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_518534] -1073, a custom manufactured 
lipid-encapsulated messenger RNA (mRNA) -based prophylactic vaccine encoding for 
antigens from infl uenza viruses and severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -
CoV -2). mRNA -1073 encodes for the respective antigens also encoded for by [CONTACT_46317] -1010 
and mRNA -1273 (also known as Moderna coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID -19] vaccine).  
Seasonal influenz a viruses are estimated by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) to cause 
3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths each year resulting in a severe 
challenge to public health. Influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_14258] a seasonal 
circulation pattern with increased cases during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere 
(NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH). Because influenza viruses continuously change through 
a process termed antigenic drift, the circulating viruses are actively monit ored by a worldwide 
monitoring network coordinated by [CONTACT_14300]. Based on the observed circulation patterns and 
antigenic changes, an expert panel recommends influenza virus strains to be used for vaccine 
manufacturing twice per year (once for the NH and onc e for the SH). Influenza A and 
influenza B viruses are the most relevant influenza viruses for human infection. Therefore, 
current vaccine recommendations include 1 influenza A H1N1 strain, 1 influenza A H3N2 
strain, and 2  influenza B strains (covering the  B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages).  
Currently, licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 50% overall effectiveness 
and are poorly effective during years when the circulating viruses do not match the strains 
selected for the vaccine antigen s. Influenza vaccines based on mRNA technology could 
provide several benefits compared to current vaccines, including the ability to respond to 
strain changes more quickly, avoidance of mutations that may be acquired during vaccine 
production in eggs or ce ll culture, stronger immune responses, as well as improved protection 
in older adults.  
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the 
common cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_597185]. An outbreak of a novel CoV (later designated SARS -CoV -2, the 
causative agent of COVID -19) initially emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 
December  2019. The WHO declared COVID -[ADDRESS_788933], with more than 500  million cases and 
6.2 million deaths as of  19 Apr 2022.  
The Sponsor has developed a rapid -response, proprietary vaccine platform based on an mRNA 
delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells in vivo can 
take up mRNA, translate it, and then express protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. The 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA [ADDRESS_788934] diseases caused by [CONTACT_597215]  A and  B. The proposed development candidate mRNA -1010 is a quadrivalent vaccine 
containing mRNAs that encode for the hemagglutinins (HAs) of the 4 strains recommended by 
[CONTACT_597216] - or recombinant -based vaccines. Equal amounts of mRNAs that encode for 
membrane -bound wild -type versions of each of the 4 different strains will be used for the HA 
components. The mRNA -1010 development candidate will be administered as a single 
intramuscular (IM) injection and aims to elicit protection from all seasonal influenza viruses 
covered by [CONTACT_29500].  The S ponsor is conducting a first -in-human (FIH) Phase 1/2 study of 
mRNA -1010 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a seasonal influenza vaccine, to establish preliminary safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity data that has supported the initiation of a Phase 3 program 
for this v accine  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).  
mRNA -1273 encodes for the full -length S protein of SARS -CoV -2, modified to introduce 
2 proline residues to stabilize the S  protein (S -2P) in a prefusion conformation. The CoV -S 
protein mediates attachment and entry of the virus into host cells (by [CONTACT_340085]), making it a 
primary target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that prevent infection. It has been confirmed 
that the stabilized SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_788935] prefusion conformation.  
In December 2020, mRNA -1273 was granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the US 
for the prevention of COVID -19 for individuals 18 years of age and older. In November 2021, 
the US Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) granted EUA for an mRNA -1273 booster dose 
( ) to be given at least  [ADDRESS_788936] 2021, the Sponsor filed a Biologics License Application (BLA) 
with the FDA for the full licensure of the mRNA -1273 vaccine for active immunization to 
prevent COV ID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older.  In January 2022, the US  FDA 
approved the BLA for SPI[INVESTIGATOR_340001] (mRNA -1273) to prevent COVID -19 in individuals 18 
years of age and older.  
mRNA -1073 is a custom manufactured lipid -encapsulated mRNA -based prophylacti c vaccine 
encoding for antigens from influenza viruses and SARS -CoV -2. 
The administration of mRNA -1073 vaccine, encoding for the respective antigens also encoded 
for by [CONTACT_46317] -1010 (seasonal influenza) and mRNA -1273 (SARS -CoV -2), has the potential to 
efficie ntly reduce the overall burden of acute viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_597186] -CoV -[ADDRESS_788937] influenza and SARS -CoV -2 viruses.

Overall Study Design:  
This is a Phase 1 /2, randomized, stratified, observer -blind study to evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1073 compared to co -administered mRNA -
1010 and mRNA -1273 vaccines and to the individual vaccines alone in healthy adults 18 to 75 
years of age.  
Participants in the study will participate in a Screening period (up to 28  days before Day  1), 
treatment pe riod (single dose of vaccine on Day 1), and a follow -up period (up to 6  months 
after vaccination).  
On Day 1, each participant will receive 2 injections administered IM, one in each arm, in the 
deltoid muscle. The vaccines to be tested include: 1) mRNA -1273  vaccine encoding for the 
full-length S protein of SARS -CoV -2, modified to introduce S -2P in a prefusion conformation; 
2) mRNA -1010 vaccine encoding for the HA surface glycoproteins of the 4 strains by [CONTACT_597220] 2022 SH influenza season cell - or reco mbinant -based vaccines; and 3)  mRNA -

years old and 50 to 75 years old, balanced across the 2 age groups within each vaccina tion 
group). The numbers of participants and groups are shown in the below table.  
Participants will have 6 visits and 4 safety phone calls. Vaccines (mRNA -1073, mRNA -1010, 
or mRNA -1273) and placebo (as indicated) will be administered as IM injections, one in each 
arm, in the deltoid muscle . Safety and/or immunogenicity and/or biomarkers study visits will 
occur on Days 4,  8, 29, and 181 (end of study [EoS]). Study visits will include scheduled

An independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee (CEAC) that includes pediatric and 
adult cardiologists will review suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if 
they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” events, and to assess severity (Gargano 
et al 2021). Any cases that the CEAC assesses as representing probable or confirmed cases of 
myocarditis or pericarditis will be referred to the Sponsor, who will then m ake a final decision 
on whether to suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing based on an assessment of the 
overall potential risk to study participants.  
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and 
reviewed at  the organizational meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC 
composition, responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its

Immunogenicity Analyses:  
The analyses of immunogenicity will be based on the  per-protoco l (PP) set. If the number of 
participants in the  full analysis set  (FAS) and PP set differs (defined as the difference divided 
by [CONTACT_597229]) by [CONTACT_726] 10%, supportive analyses of 
immunogenicity may be conducted using the FAS.  
For the immunogenicity endpoints, the geometric mean of specif ic antibody titers with

of quantification (LLOQ) will be replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that are greater than the 
upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ.  
For mRNA -1010, seroconversion rate from baseline will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI 
using the Clopper -Pearson method at each post -baseline time point. Rate of seroconversion is 
defined as the proportion of participants with either a pre -vaccination HAI titer < 1:[ADDRESS_788954]-vacci nation HAI titer ≥ 1:40 or a pre -vaccination HAI titer ≥ 1:[ADDRESS_788955] -vaccination HAI antibody titer.  
For mRNA -1273, seroresponse is defined as either : participants with GMFR in nAb or  
(binding antibody)  bAb titers of ≥  4-fold at Day 29 compared to Day 1 in those with baseline 
titer ≥  LLOQ, or Day 29 titer ≥  4 × LLOQ if baseline titer is < LLOQ.

2.1. Background and Overview  
ModernaTX, Inc. ( the Sponsor) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_518534] -1073, a custom manufactured  lipid-
encapsulated messenger RNA (mRNA) -based prophylactic vaccine encoding for antigens from 
influenza viruses and severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2). mRNA -
1073  encodes for the respective antigens also encoded for by  [CONTACT_46317] -1010 and mRNA -1273  
(also known as  Moderna coronavirus disease 2019 [ COVID -19] vaccine) . 
Seasonal influenza viruses are estimated by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) to cause 3 to 
5 million cases of severe  illness and up to 650,000 deaths each year resulting in a severe 
challenge to public health ( WHO  2018). Influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_14258] a 
seasonal circulation pattern with increased cases during the winter months in the Northern 
Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) ( Riedel et al 2019 ). Because influenz a viruses 
continuously change through a process termed antigenic drift, the circulating viruses are actively 
monitored by a worldwide monitoring network coordinated by [CONTACT_14300] ( Monto 2018 ). Based 
on the observed circulation patterns and antigenic changes, an expert panel recommends 
influenza virus strains to be used for vaccine manufacturing twice per year (once for the NH and 
once for the SH). Influenza  A and influenza  B viruses are the most relevant influenza viruses for 
human infection. Therefore, current vaccine recommendations include 1 influenza A H1N1 
strain, 1 influenza A H3N2 strain, and 2 influenza B strains (covering the B/Victoria and 
B/Yamagata lineages).  
Currently, licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 50% overall effectiveness 
and are poorly effective during years when the circulating viruses do not match the strains 
selected for the vaccine antigens ( CDC  2020 ). Influenza vaccines based on mRNA technology 
could provide several benefits compared to current vaccines, including the ability to respond to 
strain changes more quickly, avoidance of mutations that may be acquired during vaccine 
production in eggs or cell culture, stronger immune responses, as well as improved protection in 
older adults ( Rockman et al 2020 ). 
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common 
cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_597191]. An outbreak of a novel CoV (later des ignated SARS -CoV -2, the causative 
agent of COVID -19) initially emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December  2019. The 
WHO declared COVID -[ADDRESS_788970] , with more than  500 million cases and 6.2 million deaths as of 
19 Apr 2022  (WHO  2021 ). 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 41 The Sponsor has developed a rapid -response, proprietary vaccine platform based on an mRNA 
delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells in vivo can 
take up mRNA, translate it, and then express protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. The 
delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is 
nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently.  
2.1.1.  mRNA -[ADDRESS_788971] diseases caused by [CONTACT_597215]  A and  B. The proposed development candidate mRNA -1010 is a quadrivalent vaccine 
containing mRNAs that encod e for the hemagglutinins (HAs) of the 4 strains recommended by 
[CONTACT_597216] - or recombinant -based vaccines. Equal amounts of mRNAs that encode for 
membrane -bound wild -type versions of each of the 4 different strains will be used for the HA 
components. The mRNA -1010 development candidate will be administered as a single 
intramuscular (IM) injection and aims to elicit protection from all seasonal influenza viruses 
covered by [CONTACT_29500].  
The Sponsor is conducting a first -in-human (FIH) Phase 1/2 study of mRNA -1010 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), a seasonal influenza vaccine, to establish preliminary safety, reactogenicity, 
and immunogenicity data  and recently initiated a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) to 
evaluate the safety and immunological non -inferiority of mRNA -1010 to a licensed seasonal 
influenza vaccine in adults 18 years and older .  
2.1.2.  mRNA -1273  
mRNA -1273 encodes for the full -length S protein of SARS -CoV -2, modified to introduce 
2 proline residues to stabilize the S  protein (S -2P) in a prefusion conformation. The CoV -S 
protein mediates attachment and entry of the virus into host cells (by [CONTACT_340085]), making it a primary 
target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that prevent infection ( Corbett et al 2020 ). It has been 
confirmed that the stabilized SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_788972] prefusion 
conformation ( Wrapp et al 2020 ). 
In December 2020, mRNA -1273 was granted Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) in the

SPI[INVESTIGATOR_340001] (mRNA -1273) to prevent COVID -19 in individuals 18 years of age and older.  
2.1.3.  mRNA -1073  
mRNA -1073 is a custom manufactured  lipid-encapsulated mRNA -based prophylactic vaccine 
encoding for antigens from influenza viruses and SARS -CoV -2. 
2.2. Study Rationale  
The administration of  mRNA -1073  vaccine, encoding for the respective antigens also encoded 
for by [CONTACT_46317] -1010 (seasonal influenza) and mRNA -1273 (SARS -CoV -2), has the potential to 
efficiently reduce the overall burden of acute viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_597192] -CoV -2 viruses in a convenient dosing 
regimen. mRNA -1073  offer s greater convenience and has the potential to lead to increased 
compliance with vaccine recommendations, which has bee n frequently utilized for pediatric 
vaccines ( Kurosky et al 2017 ). Furthermore, this combined regimen could provide a public 
health benefit through synergisticall y increasing coverage rates against influenza and SARS -
CoV -2 viruses.  The Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_518534] -1073 , a custom manufactured  lipid-

with increases in globulin and/or decreases in albumin with a concomitant lower 
albumin/globulin ratios, compared with control) with or without signs of diminished 
erythropoiesi s (for example, lower reticulocyte counts that lacked corresponding changes in red 
cell mass parameters) that were considered secondary to the inflammatory/immune response.  
Test article  related, generally dose  dependent clinical pathology changes were observed at

The Sponsor is currently evaluating mRNA -1010 in the mRNA -1010 -P101 study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), the FIH Phase 1/2 clinical study to establish preliminary safety and 
immunogenicity data at 3 dose levels of vaccine (50, 100, and 200 µg) against a placebo control.

Confidential  Page 45 The study comprises 3 parts with a total of 880 participants: Phase 1/2 (placebo -controlled) , 
Phase  2 NH (active -controlled), and Phase 2 Extension (active -controlled). The Phase 1/[ADDRESS_788985] evaluated mRNA -1010 at doses of 25, 50, 100, and 
200 µg. An additional Phase 2 Extension part is intended to support shel f-life at lower doses 
(6.25, 12.5, 25  µg), and has been  initiated ; the Phase 2 Extension  will be completed in Q4 2022. 
In June 2022, the Sponsor began enrolling adult participants ≥ 18 years of age in the mRNA -
1010 -P301 study, a randomized, observer -blind,  Phase 3 safety and immunogenicity of mRNA -
1010 (50 µg) vs. an active comparator (Fluarix). The selection of the 50 µg dose level is 
supported by [CONTACT_46329]  1/[ADDRESS_788986] HAI responses for H1N1 and H3N2 
strains with Day 29 geometric mean titers (GMTs) that were higher than the licensed 
comparator.   
There is also precedence for co -administering mRNA -[ADDRESS_788987] (100 μg) and Fluzone High -Dose 
Quadrivalent vaccines in approximately [ADDRESS_788988] ered 
individually ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
2.3.1.  Potential Benefits  of Study Participation  
The following benefits may accrue to participants who receive mRNA -1010 and/or mRNA -1273 
vaccine as booster doses:  
• The mRNA -[ADDRESS_788989] 
SARS -CoV -2 and its variants.  
• Participants will have a baseline (Day 1) evaluation for respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531], including 
influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, and ongoing surveillance for influenza -like illness 
(ILI) and/or COVID -19 throughout the study.  
• The study will contribute to the development of a potentially efficacious vaccine against 
seasonal influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2 given together as a single injection.  
2.3.2.  Risks from  Study Participation and Their Mitigation  
Adve rse events (AEs) ranging from immediate mild allergic reactions (eg, urticaria) to systemic 
allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) may occur following any vaccination. Systemic allergic 
reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,000 vacc inations for vaccines that 
do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein ( Zent et al 2002 ). Since the authorization

mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 46 of the mRNA -1273 vaccine for COVID -19, the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) estimate of the rate of anaphylaxis based on reporting in the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System is approximately 2.5 cases/million doses administered ( Shimabukuro 
et al 2021 ). As a precaution, all participants will remain under observation at the study site for a 
minimum of 60 minutes after injection.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by 
[CONTACT_76859]. 
Therefore, it is important that standard precautions and procedures are followed to avoid injury 
from fainting.  
Intramuscular  injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by [CONTACT_76860] -102 (heptadecan -9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(6 -oxo-6-
(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate) lipid formulation have commonly resulted in transient and 
self-limiti ng local inflammatory reactions. These typi[INVESTIGATOR_46274], erythema (redness), or 
swelling (hardness) at the injection site, which were mostly mild to moderate in severity and 
usually occurred withi n 24 hour s of injection. Laboratory abnormalities (in cluding increases in 
liver function tests and serum lipase levels) following injection have been observed in early 
phase clinical studies with similar mRNA -based vaccines. These abnormalities were without 
clinical symptoms or signs and returned toward base line (Day 1) values over time.  
In an ongoing Phase  [ADDRESS_788990] dose (0.5 mL, ) or 
booster dose (0.25 mL, ) of the  Sponsor’s COVID -19 vaccine has not yet been 
characterized.  
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
Safety and immunogenicity data from the interim analyses of the mRNA -1010 -P101 study 
(Phase  1/2 and Phase 2 NH study portions) demonstrated no significant  safety concerns  (doses 
tested ranged from  of mRNA -1010). Vaccination with mRNA -1010 elicited

and DSMB will review and assess the safety data as described in Secti on 8.5. All participants 
will be followed up f or 6 months after the study vaccination.  
Considering the nonclinical data for the combined administration of mRNA -1010 and 
mRNA -1273 vaccines and the safety and immunogenicity data for mRNA -1010, mRNA -1273, 
and other mRNA vaccines manufactured to date by [CONTACT_597233] -

4.1. General Design  
This is a Phase 1 /2, randomized,  stratified,  observer -blind study to evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1073 compared to co -administered mRNA -1010 
and mRNA -1273 vaccines and to the individual vaccines alone in healthy adults 18 to 75 years 
of age.  
Participants in the study will participate in a Screening period (up to 28  days before Day  1), 
treatment period (single dose of vaccine on Day 1), and a follow -up period (up to 6  months after 
vaccination). The study schema is present ed in Figure  1. 
On Day 1, each participant will receive 2 injections administered IM, one in each arm, in the 
deltoid muscle. The vaccines to be tested include : 1) mRNA -1273 vaccine encoding for the 
full-length S protein of SARS -CoV -2, modified to introduce S -2P in a prefusion conformation; 
2) mRNA -1010 vaccine encoding for the HA surface glycoproteins of the 4 strains by [CONTACT_597236] 2022 SH influenza season cell - or recombinant -based vaccines; and 3)  mRN A-1073 
vaccine encoding for the respective antigens also encoded for by [CONTACT_46317] -1010 and mRNA -1273.  
The placebo and the diluent for mRNA -1073 vaccine will be 0.9% sodium chloride (normal  
commerc ial saline ) injection, which meets the criteria of the US Pharmac opeia  (USP) . 
The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_788994] COVID -19 vaccine (primary series or booster) must be  
≥ 120 days prior  (or less per local guidance)  to the randomization  visit. Participants must not 
have received a licensed influenza vaccine within ≤ [ADDRESS_788995] no 
known history of confirmed influenza infection within ≤ 180 days or SARS -CoV -2 infection 
within ≤  90 days of Screening . Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (18 to  49 years old and 
50 to 75 years old, balanced across the 2 age groups within each vaccination group). A complete 
listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Section  5. The number s of participants 
and groups are shown in Table  3.

The Schedule of Events (SoE) is provided in Table  1. 
Participants will have 6 visits and 4 safety phone calls. Vaccines (mRNA -1073, mRNA -1010, or 
mRNA -1273) and placebo (as indicated) will be administered as IM injections, one in each arm, 
in the deltoid muscle . Safety and/or immunogenicity and/or biomarkers study visits will occur on 
Days 4, 8, 29, and 181 (end of study [EoS]). Study visits will include scheduled safety phone 
calls at Days 57, 91, 121, and [ADDRESS_788996] adverse events ( AEs), medically attended AEs 
(MAAEs), AEs of special interest (AESIs), AEs leading to withdrawal, serious adverse events 
(SAEs ), and information about concomitant medications and receipt of non -study vaccinations.  
At the dosing visit on Day 1, participants wil l be instructed how to re cord solicited ARs within 
the provided electronic diary (eDiary). Solicited ARs will be collected for 7 days (the day of 
injection and the following 6  days) , and local solicited ARs will be collected  separately for each 
injection s ite. Unsolicited AEs will be collected  for 28 days (the day of injection and the 
following 27  days) after injection; SAEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, and AESIs will 
be collected  throughout the study. All participants will be tested for the presence of 
SARS -CoV -2 and influenza antigens at baseline via nasopharyngeal  (NP) swabs (Day 1) and at 
any unscheduled visits. Blood draws will be collected on Days 1, 8, 29, and 181 /EoS . There will 
be an additional visit on Day 4 at which blood will be drawn for f uture biomarker assessment. 
Optionally, blood draws for genomic analysis will be collected at Day 1 and for transcriptomic 
analysis at Days 1, 8, and 29. The collected samples will be processed and analyzed per the 
Laboratory Manual. Active surveillance fo r intercurrent or breakthrough SARS -CoV -2 infection 
will occur throughout the study and reported as AEs (confirmed symptomatic infections will be 
reported as MAAEs if not SAEs). Participants with signs and symptoms meeting the CDC case 
definition for COVID -19 ([ADDRESS_788997] recent; CDC  2021 b) will be asked to 
contact [CONTACT_597237] , which will include reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR ) testing (of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_152922]) to assess symp tomatic 
COVID -19. Participants with any clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia will also

Participants may experience AEs (including s ymptoms of COVID -19) that necessitate an 
unscheduled visit. There may also be situations in which the investigator asks a participant to 
report for an unscheduled visit following the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be 
conducted at these visits  as necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of participants during 
the study. Electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) should be completed for each unscheduled visit.  
The IST will conduct ad hoc reviews throughout the study,  as requested by [CONTACT_597238].  An independent , unblinded DSMB will be used throughout the 
conduct of this study. This committee will be composed of independent members with relevant 
therapeutic and/or biostatistical expertise to allow for the ongoing review of safety data from this 
study population. S afety data will be reviewed as needed when study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_597193], or as otherwise requested by [CONTACT_76846]/or IST  as described in the DSMB 
charter . See  Secti on 8.[ADDRESS_788999] and DSMB constituted in this study.   
An interim analys is (IA) will be performed after all [ADDRESS_789000] completed their Day 29 visit assess ments and will include the safety and 
immunogenicity data collected up to Day  29. The final study analysis will be completed for all 
participants  after Day 181 /EoS . 
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice  (GCP ), and 
all applicable regulatory requirements.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed as a randomized,  stratified,  observer -blind  study to evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1073 compared to co -administered mRNA -1010 
and mRNA -1273 and to mRNA -1010 vaccine and mRNA -1273 vaccine administered alone in 
healthy adults 18 to 75  years of age. The purpose of this Phase 1 /2 study ( mRNA -1073 -P101 ) is 
to generate sufficient safety and immunogenicity data to enable the i nitiation of a Phase 2/3 
study.  
All participants will provide NP swab samples before the injection on Day 1 for assessment of 
infection with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531], including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, as influenza or 
COVID -19 symptoms may confound reactogenicity assessments. Furthermore, NP swab samples 
for assessment of infection with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531], including influenza virus and 
SARS -CoV -2, will be collected anytime from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS if the participants 
have protocol -defined IL I or symptoms suggestive of COVID -19 or other upper or lower 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 53 respi[INVESTIGATOR_597194]’s discretion. Additionally, clinical information may be 
collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
4.3. Choice of Vaccine Dose s 
The Sponsor is currently conducting mRNA -1010 -P101, the FIH Phase 1/2 study of mRNA -
1010 to establish preliminary safety , reactogenicity , and immunogenicity data at 3 dose levels of 
vaccine ( ) against a placebo control ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). The IA1 of safety  data 
at Day  29 of 180 healthy adults (45 participants per group) in the [LOCATION_002] showed no 
significant safety concerns  for the doses tested , with the  dose of mRNA -[ADDRESS_789001] favorable reactogenicity profile . The immunogenicity data at Day 29 showed that 
mRNA -1010 elicited immune responses as measured by [CONTACT_597239] 4 strains included in the 
vaccine, across all dose levels and age groups. Encouragingly, all 3 dose levels elicited similar 
levels of immune responses . Additional information  is available in the IB . 
The mRNA -1010 -P101 study has enroll ed 498 adults in a Phase 2 NH cohor t in 4 groups:  
mRNA -1010 (n= 151),  mRNA -1010  (n=147 ),  mRNA -1010  (n=147 ), and Afluria  
(n=53 ). The IA2 of safety  data through  Day 29 demonstrated  no significant safety concerns . The 
frequency and severity of the reports of solicited ARs in the mRNA -1010 groups were 
acceptable across all dose levels.  
IA1 and IA2  data through Day 29 for both the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_789002] SARS -CoV -2. Having 
achieved the primary endpoint in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study for SARS -CoV -2 infection, mRNA -
1273 was granted EUA in December 20 20 and BLA in January 2022 for the prevention of 
COVID -19 for individuals 18 years of age and older ( Baden et al 2021 ). Given the potential for 
waning immunity, the emergence of highly transmissible SARS -CoV -2 variants, and the ability 
of some variants to partially escape immunity, the Sponsor assessed the immunogenicity and 
safety of a  booster  immunization . The FDA has authorized for emergency use the 
administr ation of a single booster dose ( ) of mRNA -1273 vaccine after completing the 
primary series of this vaccine in individuals 18 years of age and older.  Additionally, the FDA 
recently amended the EUA  to authorize a second booster dose for people 50 years of age and 
older and for certain immunocompromised individuals. Additional information is available in the 
IB.

5.3. Lifestyle Restrictions  
Participants must not eat or drink anything hot or cold within [ADDRESS_789009] chosen to receive it.  
5.4. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently assigned to treatment. A minimum set of screen failure information is required 
to ensure transparent reporting of screen failures to meet the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. 
Minimum information includes date of informed consent, demography, reason(s) for screen 
failure, eligibility criteria, and information  on any SAE that may have occurred from the time 
informed consent was obtained to the time of withdrawal.  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure)  may be 
rescreened  one time within the [ADDRESS_789010] (IP) refers to mRNA -1073, mRNA -1010, or mRNA -1273 
vaccine administered in this study.  
mRNA -1073  
mRNA -1073 is administered as a single dose and aims to elicit protection from influenza and 
SARS -CoV -2. mRNA -1073 contains mRNA coding for 4 HA antigens of the  influenza virus 
strains recommended for the 2022 SH seasonal vaccines by [CONTACT_597223]

6.3.1.  Preparation of Study Vaccine  
The IP (mRNA -1073, mRNA -1010, and mRNA -1273) and placebo preparation instructions are 
detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.2.  Study Vaccine Administration  
mRNA -1073, mRNA -1010, or mRNA -1273 and placebo (if indicated) will be administered as 
IM injec tions , one in each  deltoid muscle on Day 1 , according to the procedures specified in the 
Pharmacy Manual. Each arm (left and right) and the corresponding vaccine or placebo 
administered will be recorded by [CONTACT_597241]/personnel before unblinding is authorized.  
On Day 1, participants will be monitored for a minimum of 60 minutes after vaccination. 
Assessments will include vital sign measurements and monitoring for local or systemic ARs as 
shown in the SoE ( Table  1). 
The study site will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training/certification. Either onsite resuscitation equipment and personnel or 
appropriate protocols for the rapid transport of a participant to a resuscitation area or facility are 
required.  
Please see details  provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.3.  Study Vaccin e Delivery and Receipt  
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the following:  
• Supplying the IP (mRNA -1073, mRNA -1010, and mRNA -1273) and placebo 
(0.9% sodium chloride)  
• Confirming the appropriate labeling of the IP, so it complies with the legal requirem ents

6.3.5.  Study Vaccine Storage  
mRNA -[ADDRESS_789012] be stored at -25°C to -15°C ( -13°F to 5°F) in a secure area 
with limited access and must  be protected from moisture and light until they are  prepared for 
administration ( Section  6.3.1 ). mRNA -[ADDRESS_789013] be stored at  -90°C to -60°C in a secure area 
with limited access and must be protected from moisture and light until it is prepared for  
administration ( Section  6.3.1 ). The freezer should have automated temperature recording and a 
24-hour alert system in place that allows for rapid response in case of freezer malfunction. It is 
recommended that there should  be an available backup freezer.  It is also recommended that  the 
freezer should be connected to a backup generator. In addition, for IP accountability, staff are 
required to keep a temperature log to establish a record of compliance with these storage 
cond itions. The study site is responsible for reporting any IP that was not temperature controlled 
during shipment or storage. Such IP will be retained for inspection by [CONTACT_365132].  The 0.9% sodium chloride inject ion (USP) should be stored 
at 20 °C to 25 °C (68 °F to 77 °F) in a restricted access area.  
6.3.6.  Study Vaccine Accountability  
It is the investigator’s responsibility that the IP accountability study staff maintain accurate records 
in an IP accountability log of receipt of all IP, site IP inventory, IP dispensing, IP injections, and 
return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used and unused IP vials.

unblinded study staff and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. The qualified 
unblinded staff will confirm that the participant has received the en tire dose of IP and will record 
the inject ion site (left or right deltoid) and the corresponding vaccine or placebo administered 
and will keep the information confidential from other study documents/personnel until 
unblinding is authorized. If a participan t does not receive IP or does not receive all of the 
planned dose, the reason for the missed dose will be recorded. Data will be reconciled with site 
accountability records to assess compliance.  
The study site staff are responsible for ensuring that partic ipants comply with the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_14311] a visit within the defined visit window specified in the SoE ( Table  1). If 
a participant does not complete a visit within the time window, that visit may be classified as a 
missed visit and the participant will continue with subsequent scheduled study visits. All safety 
requirements of the missed visit will be captured and included in the subsequent visit.  
6.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
6.5.1.  Prior Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76815] (including any prescription or over -the-counter  medications, 
vaccines, or blood products) taken by [CONTACT_14312] 28 days before providing 
informed consent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be recorded in 
the participant’s eCRF.  
6.5.2.  Concomitant Medications and Ther api[INVESTIGATOR_597196], study staff must question the participant regarding any medications taken and

• All concomitant medications taken through 28 days after vaccination. Antipyretics and 
analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the absence of any symptoms in 
anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as such.  
• Systemic steroids (≥ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent),  immunosuppressants, 
immune -modifying drugs, immunoglobulins, and/or blood products administered at any 
time during the study period after the IP injection.

such as migraine headaches . 
Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded using the WHO Drug Global.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator and the contract research 
organization ’s (CRO’s ) medical monitor will make a joint decision about continuing or 
withholding further injection of the participant based on the time the medication was 
administered, the drug’s pharmacology and pha rmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication 
will compromise the participant’s safety or interpretation of the data. It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that details regarding the concomitant medications are adequately 
recorded in the eCR F. 
6.5.3.  Conco mitant Medications and Vaccines That May Lead to the  Elimination of a 
Participant From Per-Protocol Analyses 
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s evaluability in the per -protocol

7.1. Pause Rules  
Study pa use rules will be continuously monitored during all periods of the study by [CONTACT_4520], IST, and DSMB (as warranted). If the investigator, IST, or DSMB request that the 
study be paused due to a safety concern, further study vaccination will be suspe nded, but all 
other planned procedures relating to safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessments will 
continue as described in the study protocol. An unblinded statistician will support the 
determination if study pause rules have been met. The IST  will be composed of the Sponsor’s 
physicians.  The Sponsor will notify the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research within 
[ADDRESS_789016]   
The occurrence of any of the events listed in  Table  4, regardless of vaccination group , will result 
in immediate suspension of dosing and enrollment. An unscheduled DSMB will be convened to 
assess specific data concerns and to make recommendations.

abnormality.  The calculation for ≥  20% of participants in the ex pansion stage includes exposed participants in the 
initial stage  and the expansion stage  as the total number of participants in the denominator.   
3  Grading of laboratory parameters (specified in Section  8.1.5 ) will be based on the  US FDA  Guidance for Industry 
“Toxicity  Grading  Scale for  Healthy  Adult and  Adolescent  Volunteers  Enrolled in  Preventive  Vaccine  Clinical  
Trials” ( DHHS  2007 ).  
If a pause  is triggered in the study, each participant’s  study site  visits will continue until  EoS. If a  
pause  affects a participant’s Vaccination Visit, the window for that participant’s Vaccination 
Visit will be suspended until the  pause  is lifted and vaccination can resume. Once the  pause  is 
lifted, vaccination should be reinstated as soon as possible.   
If a participant is in the  Screening  period  for more than 28 da ys as the result of a  pause, the 
participant may be rescreened for study eligibility (and will receive a new screening number) as 
long as the participant continues to provide consent  to participate in the study.   
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA [ADDRESS_789021] be measured before vaccination. The following events constitute criteria 
for delay of injection , and if either of these events occur at the time scheduled for dosing, the 
participant may be injected at a later date within the time window specified in the SoE ( Table  1), 
or the participant may be discontinued from dosing at the discretion of the investigator 
(Section  7.3): 
• Acute moderate or severe  infection with or without fever at the time of dosing  
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) at the time of dosing  
Participants with a fever  ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) will be contact[CONTACT_597243]. If the investigator determines that the 
participant’s health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes injection, the visit should be 
rescheduled within the allowed interval for that visit.   
The investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, may withhold the IP 
injection if the participant meets any of the following criteria:  
1. Becomes pregnant.  
2. Develops symptoms or condi tions listed in the exclusion criteria.  
3. Experiences a clinically significant change in clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements, or general condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, requires 
withholding of vaccine.  
The reason(s)  for withholding the injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, an injection could be delayed within the visit 
window based on the joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  6.5.3 ). 
7.3. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study  
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  
A “withdrawa l” from the study refers to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the 
final visit planned in the protocol.   
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment th e participant may need to receive. The investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 68 If a participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the investigator will 
attempt to ob tain agreement to follow -up with the participant until the event is considered 
resolved or stable and will then complete the EoS eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the decision  to withdraw a participant from the study was made by [CONTACT_513293], as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• AESI (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Solicited AR or reactogenicity event (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up (LTFU)  
• Physician decision (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_3445] (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (incl uding SAEs, AESIs, 
solicited ARs, or reactogenicity events) must be clearly distinguished from participants who are 
withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will follow -up with participants who are withdrawn 
from the study as result of an AE, SAE, AESI, solicited AR, or reactogenicity until resolution of 
the event.  
A participant withdrawing from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
If the participant withd raws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent ( Section  11.1.6 ). 
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research results that have already been collected 
for the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. All 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA [ADDRESS_789022] already been  collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted by [CONTACT_427]).  
7.4. Lost to Follow -up  
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw c onsent and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_46342], counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the investigator or designee must ma ke every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_14386] (eg, dates of telephone cal ls and registered 
letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• If the registered/certified letter is signed by [CONTACT_597244] , 
the subject is considered to be noncompliant with study visits or procedu res and will be 
considered to have withdrawn from the study . 
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.

Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants will sign a n informed consent 
form (ICF) (as detailed in Section  11.1.6 ). Participants will undergo study procedures at the time 
points specified in the SoE ( Table  1). A participant can also be seen for an unscheduled visit at 
any time during the study. Reasons for an unscheduled visit may include, but are not limited to, 
reactogenicity issues, symptoms of potential ILI and/or COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. The 
site also has the discretion to make reminder telephone calls or send text messages to inform the 
participant about visits, review eDiary requireme nts, or follow  up on ongoing or outstanding 
issues.  
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency ,” investigators may convert study site visits to home visits 
or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor. Such action should be taken to protect 
the safety and well -being of participants and study site staff or to comply with state or municipal 
mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures includ e the following:  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their timing 
must be followed as presented in the SoE ( Table  1). Adherence to the study design 
requirements is essential and required for study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue participation in 
the study.  
• All Screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligib ility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• The Screening Visit and Day 1 visit will not be performed on the same day. Additionally, 
the Screening Visit assessments may be performed over multiple visits if within the 
28-day Screening wind ow. 
8.1. Safety Assessments and Procedures  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant, 
according to the SoE ( Table  1): 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section  8.4.3 ) that occur during the 7 days following 
vaccine administration (ie, the day of  study  injection s [Day 1] and 6  subsequent days ). 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 71 Solicited ARs will be recorded daily using electronic diaries ( Section  8.1.1 ). Local 
solicited ARs will be recorded separately for each injection site.  
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28 days fol lowing vaccination (ie,  the 
day of injection [Day 1] and 27 subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs are defined in 
Section  8.4.1 .  
• SAEs, AESIs, MAAEs , and AEs leading to discontinuation from study participation from 
vaccination on Day 1 through Day 181/ EoS or withdrawal from the study . 
• Results of safety laboratory tests  (Section  8.1.5 ). 
• Vital sign measurements ( Section  8.1.4 ). 
• Physical examination findings ( Section  8.1.6 ). 
• Symptom Reporting  eDiary  for ILI and COVID -19 from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS as 
described below in Section  8.1.8 . 
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be colle cted after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of their participation in the study ( Section  8.4.8 ). 
The incidence and severity of the ab ove events will be monitored by [CONTACT_597225] .  
8.1.1.  Use of Electronic Diaries  
At the time of consent, the participants must confirm they will be willing to complete an eDiary 
(for 7 -day reactogenicity). The local and system ARs that will be solicited by [CONTACT_46348]  6. Participants will also use the  Symptom Reporting  eDiary  to record any ILI 
and/or COVID -19 symptoms that they experience after vaccination from Day  1 through 
Day 181/EoS . 
On Day 1 (dosing day), pa rticipants will be instructed on thermometer usage to measure body 
temperature, ruler usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), 
and self -assessment for localized axillary swelling or tenderness on the same side as the inj ection 
arm. 
On Day 1 (dosing day), participants will record data into the eDiary starting approximately 
[ADDRESS_789023] the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as defined in Section  8.4.3 .

• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the  thermometer provided by [CONTACT_3452]. If body 
temperature is taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature reading 
should be recorded.  
• Other measurements, as applicable, for solicited local ARs (injection site erythema and 
swelling/induration) will be performed using the ruler provided by [CONTACT_3452].  
• Record whether a ny medications were taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on Day 1 or 
for the next 6  days.  
Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants durin g the Day 8 visit (Visit  3) after 
vaccination.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use  
Study sites will distribute Sponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by [CONTACT_365136], respectively, f or recording solicited ARs 
in the eDiaries. Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to those participants 
who do not have their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
8.1.2.  Safety Telephone Call  
A safety telephone call is a telephone call mad e to the participant by a trained site personnel. 
This call will follow a Sponsor -approved script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant 
safety information. Safety calls by [CONTACT_597245] (Table  1). The participant will be interviewed according to the script about 
the occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, AESIs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinu ation , concomitant 
medications associated with those events, and any non -study vaccinations ( Section  8.4.9 ). In 
addition, study personnel will coll ect information on known participant exposure to someone 
with COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on the participant’s experience of COVID -[ADDRESS_789025] results in identification of a relevant safety event.

Confidential  Page 73 8.1.3.  Pregnancy Testing   
Pregnancy testing include s the following:   
• A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit and before 
the IM injections  on Day 1. At any time, a pregnancy test either via blood or  point -of-
care urine can be performed, at the discretion of the investigator.   
• If not docum ented in a female participant’s medical records, FSH test may be performed 
at the Screening Visit, as necessary and at the discretion of the investigator, to confirm 
menopausal status  (please see Section  11.2 for details) .  
8.1.4.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and body temperature (preferred route is oral). The  participant will be seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the time points 
indicated in the SoE  (Table  1). On the day of IP administration, vital sign measurements will be 
collected once before and at least 60 minutes  after vaccination. Vital signs may be collected at 
other study visits in conjun ction with a  symptom -directed  physical examination.  
If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical abnormalities 
of Grade  3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade will be documented in the AE section of the 
eCRF (un less there is another known cause of the abnormality that would result in an AE 
classification). The investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additional 
assessments until the vital sign value has reached the reference range, returns to th e vital sign 
value at baseline, or is considered stable or until the investigator determines that follow -up is no 
longer medically necessary.   
Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) before injection on Day [ADDRESS_789026], total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine. Any clinically significant finding ( DHHS  2007 ) identified 
on the safety  laboratory testing should be reported as an AE.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 74 Additional blood samples for safety laboratory tests may be taken at the discretion of the 
investigator if warranted to ensure participant’s safety.  
8.1.6.  Physical Examinations  
A full physical examination, includ ing height and weight, will be performed at the Screening 
Visit as indicated in the SoE ( Table  1). The full examination will include assessment of skin, 
head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph 
nodes, and musculoskeletal system and extremities. At Screening, the BMI will be calculated 
using the formula weight (kg) / (height [m])2. Any clinically sig nificant finding identified during 
a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other time points at the discretion 
of the investigator. On the day of vaccination, prior to injection, both arms and associated lymph 
nodes should be examined , and any abnormalities should be documented . 
8.1.7.  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained, after [ADDRESS_789027], at Visit 
1/Day [ADDRESS_789028] 12 -lead ECG procedure. The purpose of the ECG is to serve as a 
baseline comparison , should it be necessary , for subsequent clinical evaluation of suspected 
myocarditis/pericarditis.  The ECG output should be filed in  the participant ’s binder. No 
additional action  (including review/interpretation)  is required . 
8.1.8.  Assessment for Respi[INVESTIGATOR_597197], participants might experience symptoms consistent with ILI or SARS -CoV -2 
infection.  
All participants will provide NP swab samples before the injection on Day 1 for assessment of 
infection with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531], including influenza viruses and SARS -CoV -2, as influenza 
or COVID -19 symptoms may confound reactogenicity assessment s (CDC  2021b). 
A study illness visit or a consultation will be arranged within [ADDRESS_789029] an NP swab ( Table  1) to test for presence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531] (including influenza 
viruses and SARS -CoV -2) via RT -PCR if a participant experiences:  
• Symptoms of ILI or SARS -CoV -2 infection (for definitions , see Section  8.4.5  and 
Section  8.4.6 ). 
Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the 
clinical case. All findings will be recorded in the eCRF.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 75 • Participants will be instructed to re port via Symptom Reporting eDiary  or telephone calls  
whether ILI/COVID -[ADDRESS_789030] been experienced (see Section  8.4.5  and 
Section  8.4.6  for symptoms), once  weekly from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS. If 
symptoms occur, participants will be directed to return to the study site as soon as 
possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_789031] the study participant by [CONTACT_756].  
It is important to note that some of the symptoms of ILI and COVID -19 overlap with solicited 
systemic ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA -1073, mRNA -1010, and 
mRNA -1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, 
when these solicited ARs are common, investigators should use their clinical judgment to decide 
whether an NP  swab should be collected. The collection of an NP  swab prior to the Day  1 
vaccination can help ensure that cases of influenza or COVID -19 are not overlooked. Any study 
participant reporting symptoms consistent with protocol -defined ILI ( Section  8.4.5 ) or COVID -
19 (Section  8.4.6 ) during the 7 -day period after vaccination should be evaluated for COV ID-19 
and influenza.  
If scheduled, a study site illness visit may include additional assessments such as medical history 
and physical examination. The NP swab sample may be tested by [CONTACT_76878] -PCR for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_365095] -CoV -2 and influenza  to evaluate the severity of the clinical 
case.  
All cases that meet the CDC definition of ILI and/or COVID -19 will be captured as MAAEs, 
along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, and 
outcome.  
8.2. Immunogenicity Assess ments  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in 
the SoE ( Table  1). Immunogenicity assessments will be performed for all participants. Immune 
response to influenza vaccine antigens will be using HAI assay , with potential utilization on 
microneutralization as say for influenza strains that do not perform favorabl y in the HAI assay. 
Immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 vaccine  antigens  will utilize  either  pseudovirus 
neutralization  (PsVNA ) nAb assay or multiplex bAb assay, depending on the timing of data 
delivery.  The following analytes will be measured:  
• Influenza: Serum antibody level as measured by [CONTACT_597246], Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 76 • Influenza: Serum nAb level as measured by [CONTACT_597247]   
• SARS -CoV -2: Serum nAb titers as measured by [CONTACT_597248] -CoV -2 protein s 
• Cellular immunogenicity in a subset of participants  
Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are available and that vi al 
volumes are likely to be adequate for future testing needs. The actual date and time of each 
sample  will be  collected . Unique sample identification will be utilized to maintain the blind at 
the laboratory at all times and to allow for automated sample t racking and housing. Handling and 
preparation of the samples for analysis, as well as shippi[INVESTIGATOR_76818], will be 
provided in a separate study manual.  
Measurement of antibody levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by [CONTACT_1034] . 
According to the ICF ( Section  11.1.6 ), excess serum from immunogenicity testing may be used 
for future research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further 
characterize the immune response to influenza and SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_789032] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug/vaccine 
in humans, whether or not considered related to the drug/vaccine.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the cond ition, after the IP injection.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the IP injection even though they may have 
been present before the start of the study.  
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Procedures planned before study entry (eg, hosp italization for preplanned surgical 
procedure).  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 77 • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
conveni ence admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  8.4.3 ). For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means that 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the vaccine and the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by [CONTACT_46354] a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, 7 days after vaccination).  
An incidental, asymptomatic RT -PCR confirmed COVID -19 case (ie, workplace screening) 
should be reported a s an unsolicited AE of “asymptomatic COVID -19” if occurring during the 
first [ADDRESS_789033] was performed on the NP swab 
collected prior to study vaccination (Day 1).  
8.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE (including an AR) is considered an SAE if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the investigator 
during the proto col-defined follow -up period must be reported to the Sponsor, whether or 
not it is considered related to the IP.  
• Is life -threatening   
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the investigator or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597198] e participant was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597199]/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. The 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597200]. Complications that occur 
during inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597201] s; however, if a complication/AE

mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 78 recorded as a separate SAE. Procedures planned before study entry (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597203]) are not considered SAEs.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption  of the ability to conduct 
normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle ) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Medically important event   
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriat e 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597204] l isted in the 
above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.4.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after IP injection. The eDiary will solicit daily participant reporting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  8.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an 
eDia ry during the 7 days after vaccination (ie, the day of injection [Day 1] and 6 subsequent 
days) . Local solicited A Rs will be recorded separately for each injection site.  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented in Table  6 modified from the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Trials ( DHHS  2007 ). 
If a participant reported a solicited AR during the solicited period and did not record the event in 
the eDiary, the event should be recorded on the Reactogenicity page of the eCRF.  If the event 
starts during the solicited period, but continues beyond [ADDRESS_789034] 
an end date from the participant  to close out the event on the Reactogenicity page of the eCRF.  If 
the participant reported an event after the solicited period (ie, after Day 7), it should be recorded 
as an AE on the AE page of the eCRF.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073

• Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to a healthcare practitioner (HCP), to 
be recorded as an MAAE ( Section  8.4.4 ). 
• Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study or 
the participant being withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_093] (AE leading to 
withdrawal).  
• Solicited local or systemic AR lasting beyond [ADDRESS_789037]  injecti on. 
• Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE.  
8.4.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events  
An MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to an HCP, including telephone calls. This 
would include visits to a study site for unsc heduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory 
follow -up, COVID -19 [Section  8.1.8 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent 
care, primary care physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of 
any MAAEs. Unsolicited AEs will be captured on the AE page of the eCRF.

7. Diarrhea  
A CDC -defined ILI is defined as body temperature ≥  37.8°C (100°F) accompanied by a cough 
and/or sore throat.  
An RT -PCR -confirmed influenz a infection is defined as a positive influenza result on a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_56791] -PCR done within 7 days of onset of protoc ol-defined ILI at any setting 
during the study period.  
8.4.6.  Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_597207] -CoV -2 Infection  
SARS -CoV -2 should be suspected if the participant experiences  the acute onset or worsening of 
any one of the symptoms listed below ( CDC  2021c ): 
• Fever (temperature ≥ 38.0°C [100.4°F]) or chills (of any duration)  
• Cough (of any duration)  
• Shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of any  duration)  
• Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (of any duration)  
• Fatigue (lasting ≥ 48 hours)  
• Muscle or body aches (lasting ≥ 48 hours)  
• Headache (lasting ≥ 48 hours)  
• New loss of taste and/or smell (lasting ≥ 48 hours)  
• Sore throat, congestion, or runny nose (lasti ng ≥ 48 hours)  
Symptomatic COVID -19 is defined by [CONTACT_597250] -listed symptoms 
(CDC  2021c ) and a positive RT -PCR test on a respi[INVESTIGATOR_597208]. Asymptomatic SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_789039] SARS -CoV -2 infection and are 
symptomati c or asymptomatic, the investigator will notify the participants’ primary care 
physicians of the diagnosis and the local public health authorities as required per local 
regulations.  
8.4.7.  Adverse Event of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by [CONTACT_597251] a case narrative. Such 
events may require further investigation to characterize and understand them.  
Section  11.3 (Appendix  3) provides a list of AESIs pertinent to this study.  
All AESIs will be collected through the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee immediately and in a ll circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event via the electronic data capture (EDC) system. If a site receives a report of a new AESI 
from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported AESI at a time after 
the eCRF  has been taken offline, then the site can report this information on a paper AESI form 
using the SAE Mailbox, or the SAE Fax line ( Section  8.4.13 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Anaphylaxis  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as an SAE, based 
on the criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As 
an SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponso r or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours per Section  8.4.13 . The investigator will submit any updated 
anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting 
purposes, a participant who displays signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (as 
described below) should be reported as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as 
gene ral guidance for investigators and is based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition 
(Rüggeberg et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reac tion with multi -organ system involvement that can 
present as, or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14274], a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_270503]:

− Skin/mucosal: urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, and red a nd itchy eyes.  
− Cardiovascular:  measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompensated shock, 
loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, and evidence of reduced 
peripheral circulation.  
− Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficu lty breathing, stridor, upper 
airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], persistent 
dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, and rhinorrhea.  
− Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Myocarditis/Pericarditis  
A case of suspected, probable, or confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis should 
be reported as an AESI, even if it does not meet criteria per the CDC case definition. The event 
should also be reported as an SAE if it meets seriousness criteria ( Section  8.4.2 ). The CDC case 
definition is provided in Section  11.4 (Appendix  4) as guidance.  
8.4.8.  Recor ding and Follow -up of Pregnancy  
Female participants who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test at any time during the study should receive no 
further dosing with IP but should rem ain in the study and be monitored for safety.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of their participation in the study. If a pregnancy is reported, the 
investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should 
follow the procedures outlined in this section. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) will be cons idered as 
SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within [ADDRESS_789040] 
be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of 
the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 84 and/or new born complications. This follow -up should occur even if intended duration of the 
safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms will be distributed to the study 
site to be used for this purpose. The investigator must immediately (within 2 4 hours of 
awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome according to 
the procedures described for SAEs.  
8.4.9.  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after vaccination. Other (unsolicited) 
AEs will be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after vaccination.  
The MAAEs, AESIs, AE leading to withdrawa l, and SAEs will be collected from participants as 
specified in the SoE (Table  1) until the end of their participation in the study. Any AEs occurring 
before receipt of IP will be analyzed separately from AEs occurring after receipt of the study 
vaccine(s).  
At every study site visit or telephone contact, participants will be asked a standard question to 
elicit any medically related changes in their well -being (including respi[INVESTIGATOR_597209] -19 symptoms) according to the scripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they 
have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant 
medication regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any non -study 
vaccinations.  
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings, or data relevant to 
participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is 
LTFU (as defined in Section  7.4). All contacts, or contact [CONTACT_14386], concerning follow -up of 
AEs/SAEs should be recorded in the participant’s source documentation.  
8.4.10.  Assessment of Intensity  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE ( Section  8.4.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refer s to the extent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS  2007 ) will be used to categorize local and

mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 85 systemic reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs ), clinical laboratory test results, and vital sign 
measurements observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemi c reactogenicity 
events are presented in Section  8.4.3 . 
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by [CONTACT_365141]:  
• Mild : These events do not inte rfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe : These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Study staff should elicit from the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
documentation. Changes in the sev erity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s 
source documentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of 
intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset 
and duration o f each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is 
reported once in the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
8.4.11.  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to IP is part of the documentation  process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characte rized using the 
following classification:  
• Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. Participant 
did not receive the IP OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of 
the IP is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_76881].  
• Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of 
exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration 
of the IP is rea sonable. The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_340116].  
8.4.12.  Reporting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to IP or their clinica l significance. If there is any doubt as 
to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 86 All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Information to be collected includes t ype of event, time of onset, investigator -specified 
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and relationship to IP, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and 
outcome. The unsol icited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent 
illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be 
reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_597252]. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will 
be used to code all unsolicited AEs.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time of screening  but does not deteriorate should not 
be reported as an unsolicited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the study, it 
should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
8.4.13.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_597253] a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Any AE that meets SAE criteria ( Section  8.4.2 ) must be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the EDC system. The investigator will 
assess whether there is a re asonable possibility that the IP caused the SAE  as described in 
Section  8.4.11 .  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the paper SAE/AES I reporting form provided 
by [CONTACT_597254] . 
The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE as 
outlined in [ADDRESS_789041] (IRB) directly. Regulatory reporting requi rements for SAEs are 
described in Section  8.4.18 . 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to IP or study procedures, or caused the 
participant to discontinue the  study  until they are considered resolve d or clinically stable, per the 
investigator’s  judgement . 
8.4.14.  Reporting of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following process for reporting an AESI ensures compliance with 21 CFR 312 and ICH 
GCP guidelines. After learning that a participant has experienced an AESI, the investigator or 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 87 designee is responsible for reporting the AESI to the Sponsor, regardless of relationship or 
expectedness, within 24  hours of becoming aware of the event. If the AESI meets the criteria for 
an SAE, the SAE reporting procedure should be followed . 
8.4.15.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Inf ormation  
Medical occurrences that begin before IP dosing but after obtaining informed consent will be 
recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF and not in the 
AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time after IP administration , it will be 
recorded and reported as an AE.  
Adverse event s may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant.  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant.  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and nonleading mann er. 
Solicited A Rs will be collected from the day of injection through 6  days after vaccination. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day of injection through 28  days after vaccination.  
Serious AEs (including AESIs) will be collected from the start of IP dosing until the last day of 
study participation.  
All SAEs and AESIs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately , and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC 
system. If a site receives a report of a new SAE or AESI from a study participant or receives 
updated data on a previously reported SAE or AESI and the eCRF has been taken offline, then 
the site can report this information on the paper SAE /AESI report form  provide d by [CONTACT_1034] . 
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by [CONTACT_11150] (eg, leads to study drug 
discontinuation or meets any serious criteria). If this is the case, it must be recorded in the source 
document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluation that produced the value 
or result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is stabilized and the 
participant’s  safety is not at risk.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after EoS participation. However, if 
the investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any time after a participant has 
withdrawn from or completed the study and t he investigator considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 88 Participants who develop ILI will be followed through 30 days from the onset of ILI , even if 
Day 30 is beyond Day 181/EoS.  
8.4.16.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Electronic diaries have specifically been designed for this study by [CONTACT_1034]. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recordin g of information on other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomitant 
medications/vaccinations.  
The investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of study arm or 
suspected causal relationship to IP. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue  and obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets 
the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to int roduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.4.17.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU, as defined in 
Secti on 7.4. 
8.4.18.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_597255] a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention unde r clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRBs, and investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious  ARs according to 
local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 89 An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE s) from the Sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.5. Safety Monitoring  Committees  
8.5.1.  Internal Safety Team  
An internal safety team , inclusive of , at a minimum, the Sponsor’s medical monitor , Sponsor’s 
safety physician, and a CRO medical monitor , will be formed to review interim and cumulative 
blinded safety data  on a regular basis with a remit to escalate concerns to the DSMB.  The IST 
will conduct a scheduled review of safety data after at least 55 participants (approximately 5 
participants in Group 1 and approximately 10 participants in Groups  2 to 6) (see Table  3) have 
completed the Day 8 visit. Enrollment will be ongoing while this review is conducted if no pause 
rules ( Section  7.1) have been met and the study team has not identified any safety concerns. The 
IST will also conduct ad hoc reviews as requested by [CONTACT_597256].  
8.5.2.  Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
The DSMB, composed of exte rnal/independent subject matter experts, will conduct both, a 
scheduled unblinded review of safety data and as needed reviews of safety data if any pause rule 
is met or as otherwise requested by [CONTACT_76846]/or IST  as described in the DSMB charter . 
8.5.3.  Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee  
An independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee (CEAC) that includes pediatric and  
adult cardiologists will review suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if 
they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” events, and to assess severity (Gargano et 
al 2021).  Any cases that the CEAC assesses as representing probable or confirmed cases of 
myocarditis or  pericarditis will be referred to the Sponsor, who will then make a final decision 
on whether to suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing based on an assessment of the 
overall potential  risk to study participants.   
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed  
at the organizational meeting of t he CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition,  
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.  
8.6. Treatment of Overdose  
As the study treatment is to be administered by [CONTACT_76886], it is unlikely that an overdose will 
occur. Dose deviations will be tracked as protocol deviations ( Section  11.1.8 ).

Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in thi s study . 
8.8. Pharmacodynamics  
Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.  
8.9. Biomarkers  
Immunogenicity assessments are described in Section  8.2. Samples for potential biomarker  
analysis  will be collected from all participants. Transcriptomic and genomic samples will be part 
of the optional biomarker assessment once consented by [CONTACT_87755]. Exploratory 
assessments may include assessment of biomarkers for safety, reactogenicity, and inflammat ion. 
Serologic markers of di sease severity, immune response to SARS -CoV -2 or influenza, RT -PCR 
of NP swab or saliva samples, genetic sequences of SARS -CoV -2 or influenza strains isolated 
from participants’ samples, and genomic and transcriptomic samples may also be evaluated.

This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. 
The details of statistical analysis will be provided in the statistical an alysis plan (SAP), which 
will be finalized before the clinical database lock for the study. If changes are made to primary 
and/or secondary objectives or the related statistical methods after the study has begun, then the 
protocol will be amended (consiste nt with ICH Guideline E9). Changes to other secondary or 
exploratory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, along with an explanation as to 
when and why they occurred, will be listed in the SAP or clinical study report (CSR) for the 
study. Ad  hoc exploratory analyses, if any, will be clearly identified in the CSR.  
9.1. Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses  
This is an observer -blind study. The investigator, study staff, study participants, site monitors, 
and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) w ill be blinded to the IP administered until the study 
database is locked and unblinded, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to vaccine accountability 
procedures and will prepare the IP for all participant s. These personnel will have no study 
functions other than IP management, documentation, accountability, preparation, and 
administration. They will not be involved in participant evaluations and will not reveal 
the identity of the IP to either the particip ant or the blinded study site personnel involved 
in the conduct of the study unless this information is necessary in the case of an 
emergency.  
• Unblinded medically qualified study site personnel will administer the IP. They will not 
be involved in assessmen ts of any study endpoints.  
• Unblinded site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be assigned as 
the IP accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure that sites are 
following all proper IP accountability, preparatio n, and administration procedures.  
• An independent unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the preplanned 
IA (Section  9.6). Sponsor team members will be prespecified to be unblinded to the IA 
results and will not communicate the results to the blinded investigators, study site staff, 
clinical monitors, or participants.  
• The DSMB will review unblinded safety data provided by [CONTACT_597257].  The DSMB will review unblinded statistical outputs for ad hoc 
safety reviews triggered by [CONTACT_597258], should this occur. Section  11.1.[ADDRESS_789042] with the participants. Access to the randomization 
code will be strictly controlled at the pharmacy.  
9.1.1.  Breaking the Blind  
Except in the c ase of medical necessity, a participant’s vaccine assignment should not be 
unblinded without the approval of the Sponsor. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant 
during the study, the blind will be broken only if knowledge of the vaccine assignm ent will 
affect that participant’s clinical management. In the event of a medical emergency requiring 
identification of individual vaccine assignment, the investigator will make every attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_2024]’s medical monitor, preferably via electronic protocol inquiry platform, to 
explain the need for unblinding within 24 hours of opening the code. The investigator will be 
responsible for documenting the time, date, reason for unblinding, and the names of the 
personnel involved. The investigator (or des ignee) will have access to unblind participants within 
interactive response technology (IRT). All unblinding instances will be tracked via an audit trail 
in IRT and documented in the final study report.  
If unblinding should occur (by [CONTACT_597259]) before 
completion of the study, the investigator must promptly contact [CONTACT_299912].  
In addition to the aforementioned situations where the blind may be broken, the data  will also be 
unblinded to a statistical team at specified time point(s) for analysis as outlined in Section  9.1. 
9.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
No formal hypotheses will be tested. All analyses will be descriptive and presented by [CONTACT_299892].  
9.3. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this study is not dr iven by [CONTACT_76850]. The number of proposed participants is considered sufficient to provide a descriptive

9.5.3.  Immunogenicity Analysis  
The analyses of immunogenicity will be based on the PP set. If the number of participants in the 
FAS and PP set differ s (defined as the difference divided by [CONTACT_597262]) by [CONTACT_726] 10%, supportive analyses of immunogenicity may be con ducted using 
the FAS.  
For the immunogenicity endpoints, the geometric mean of specific antibody titers with 
corresponding 95% CI at each time  point and the geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of specific 
antibody titers with  the corresponding 95% CI at each po st-baseline time point over pre -injection 
baseline at Day 1 will be provided by [CONTACT_2939], with adjustment for baseline antibody titer 
and other potential covariates , including age group  and primary vaccine type. Descriptive 
summary statistics , includi ng median, minimum, and maximum , will also be provided.

mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 96 For summarizations of geometric mean titer, antibody titers reported as below the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) will be replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that are greater than the upper 
limit of q uantification (ULOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ.  
For mRNA -1010, seroconversion rate from baseline will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI 
using the Clopper -Pearson method at each post -baseline time point. Rate of seroconversion is 
defined as the proporti on of participants with either a pre -vaccination HAI titer < 1:[ADDRESS_789048]-vaccination HAI titer ≥ 1:40 or a pre -vaccination HAI titer ≥ 1:[ADDRESS_789049] -vaccination HAI antibody titer.  
For mRNA -1273, seroresponse is defined as either : participants with GMFR in nAb or bAb titers 
of ≥ 4-fold at Day 29 compared to Day 1 in those with baseline titer ≥ LLOQ, or Day 29 titer 
≥ 4 × LLOQ if baseline titer is < LLOQ.  
The immunogenicity of mRNA -1073 will follow the same rules as mRNA -1010  and 
mRNA -1273.  
Between -group comparisons will be evaluated in terms of immunogenicity endpoints (GMR and 
SCR/SRR difference) in the PP set and will be specified in the SAP in greater detail.  
9.5.4.  Exploratory Analyses  
Exploratory analyses not addressed in Secti on 9.5.3  will be described in the SAP before database 
lock.  
9.5.5.  Subgroup Analyses  
The protocol does not define any formal subgroup analyses ; however , age specific analyses 
might be performed and will be detailed in the SAP.   
9.6. Planned Analyses

eCRF s. The study monitor’s duties are to aid the investigator and the Sponsor in the maintenance 
of complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The study monitor will 
advise the investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related monitoring, audits, IRB  
review, and inspection by [CONTACT_76893]/or documents. In 
addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the investigator all regulations 
applicable to the clinical evaluation of  an IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation 
throughout the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; 
to verify completeness, accu racy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study 
conduct to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the clinical monitoring plan. During 
the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts wit h the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are being 
accurately recorded  in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being performed.  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to th e study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm that AEs and SAEs have been properly doc umented on eCRFs , that any SAEs 
have been forwarded to the SAE Hotline, and that those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.

11.1.15.  Source Documents  
Source documents are original documents or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and include, but are not limited to, 
eDiaries, medical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], screening logs, ICFs, telephone contact [CONTACT_29543], and 
worksheets. Source documents provide evidence for t he existence of the participant and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s 
site. 
Data reported on the case report form or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source 
documents must be con sistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. 
The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on 
the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  
The Sponsor or its designe e requires that the investigator prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate records for each participant treated with the IP. Source documents such as any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],

Confidential  Page 109 The S ponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and suff icient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_23863]:  
• Continuation of the study represents a significant medical risk to participants  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB or 
local health authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093]  
• Discontinuation of further mRNA -[ADDRESS_789068] editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a 
coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].  
Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_27495].  
The clinical study p lan and the results of the study will be published on www.ClinicalTrials.gov 
in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(c). The results of and data from this study belong to the 
Sponsor.

Confidential  Page 110 11.2. APPENDIX  2: Contraceptive Guidance  
Definitions: Woman of Childbearing Potential  
Women in the following categories are considered WOCBP (fertile):  
1. Following menarche  
2. From the time of menarche until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile 
(see below)  
3. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months witho ut an alternative 
medical cause.  
o A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be 
used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception 
or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_789069] discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
4. Permanent sterilization methods (for the purpose of this study) include:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
o Documen ted bilateral oophorectomy  
o Documented bilateral tubal ligation  
o For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above,  (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis), 
investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry.  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or a thletes) and a menstrual cycle 
cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should 
be considered.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of an FDA -approved 
contra ceptive method in accordance with the product label. For example:  
• Barrier method  (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) with spermicide  
• Intrauterine device  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA 1073 -P101 Protocol Amendment 2  mRNA -1073  
Confidential  Page 111 • Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via oral (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), transdermal 
(patch ), subdermal, or IM route  
• Sterilization of a female participant’s monogamous male partner prior to entry into the 
study  
Note that periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Note: An independent Cardiac Event Adj udication Committee (CEAC) comprised of medically qualified personnel, 
including cardiologists, will review suspected cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis to determine 
if they meet CDC  criteria for “probable” or “confirmed” events, ( Gargano et al 2021 ), and provide the assessment 
to the Sponsor. The CEAC members will be blinded to study treatment. Details regarding the CEAC composition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of da ta review will be defined in the CEAC charter.  
Persons who lack the listed symptoms but who meet other criteria may be classified as subclinical myocarditis 
(probable or confirmed).  
Using the Dallas criteria ( Aretz  1987 ). Autopsy cases may be classified as confirmed clinical myocarditis on the 
basis of meeting histopathologic criteria if no other identifiable cause.  
To meet the ECG or rh ythm monitoring criterion, a probable case must include at least one of 1)  ST-segment or T -

Confidential  Page 117 11.5. APPENDIX  5: Protocol Amendment History  
11.5.1.  Amendment 1 (25 Feb 2022)  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The purpose of this amendment is to allow people who have received a coronavirus disea se 2019 
(COVID -19) booster to participate in this study. The booster is now widely available in the 
[LOCATION_002], and inclusion of individuals who received immunizations beyond the primary 
series is a protocol change for updated vaccination recommendation s. mRNA -[ADDRESS_789074] received immunizations beyo nd the primary series is consistent with the 
long-term vision for the use of mRNA -1073 as an annual vaccine.  
The summary of changes table provided below describes the major changes made in 
Amendment  1 compared to the original protocol, including the sectio ns modified and the 
corresponding rationales. As applicable, the synopsis of Amendment 1 has been modified to 
correspond to changes in the body of the protocol.  
Summary of Major Changes From the Original Protocol to Protocol Amendment 1  
Section # and Name  [CONTACT_26586]  • Removed passive surveillance 
from the protocol. Participants 
will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_597266]/COVID -19 
symptoms outside the Symptom 
Reporting eDiary period.  
• Reduced the frequency durin g the 
first month to 1 time per week 
from 3 to 4 times per week.  • To improve compliance 
with eDiary reporting: 
Passive surveillance will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_597267].  
• The reduction in frequency 
is intended to reduce 
participant fatigue and 
increase compliance.  
Global  • Added 6th arm to study design for 
Phase 1 to include 
100 participants at a  
of mRNA -1073.  
• Increased the number of subjects 
in Arms 2 and 5 from 50 to 100.  • Based on the interim 
analysis of mRNA -1010 
Phase 1/2 showi ng no 
immunogenicity dose 
response, a lower dose is 
being assessed to support 
dose selection of 
mRNA -1073. Arms 2 and 5 
increased in size improve

Sections 1.1 
(Synopsis), 
2.1.2  (mRNA -1273), 
and 4.3 (Choice of 
Vaccine Dose)  • Updated mRNA -1273 booster 
guidance to individuals 18 years 
of age and older.  • The FDA has authorized 
for emergency use the 
administration of a single 
booster dose ( ) of 
mRNA -1273 vaccine in 
individuals 18  years of age 
and older.  
Sections 1.1 
(Synopsi s), 2.1.2 
(mRNA -1273), and 4.3 
(Choice of Vaccine 
Dose)  • Added: In January 2022, the US 
FDA approved the Biologics 
License Application (BLA) for 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_340001] (mRNA -1273) to 
prevent COVID -19 in individuals 
18 years of age and older.  • This updated BLA 
approval was  added to the 
protocol.  
Sections 1.1 
(Synopsis), 
4.1 (General Design), 
5.1 (Inclusion Criteria), 
and 9.3 (Sample Size 
Determination)  • Updated inclusion criteria 
(inclusion criterion 7) to allow for 
a COVID -[ADDRESS_789075] COVID -19 
vaccine received (from the 
primary series or booster) must be 
≥ 120 days prior to the 
randomization visit (or less per 
local guidance).  • Because this amendment is 
allowing participants who 
have received a COVID -[ADDRESS_789076] vaccine (primary series 
or booster) must be 
≥ 120 days prior to the 
randomization visit (or less 
per local guidance).  
Sections 1.1 (Synopsis) 
and 5.2 (Exclusion 
Criteria)  • Deleted exclusion criterion 15 
(participant has received a booster 
dose of a COVID -19 vaccine) and 
renumbered the criteria.  • Per the main rationale of 
the amendment, this 
exclusion criterion was 
removed to allow study 
participants who have 
received a booster dose of a 
COVID -19 vaccine to 
participate in this study.  
Sections  1.1 
(Synopsis), 4.1 
(General Design), 5.2 
(Exclusion Criteria), • Exclusion criteria 14 was 
changed to the following: 
Participant has known 
history of SARS -CoV -2 
infection within ≤ 90 days.  • The time from known 
history of SARS -CoV -
2 infection was 
reduced from ≤ 180 
days to ≤ 90 days to

Sections 1.1 
(Synopsis), 
4.1 (General Design), 
and 
6.2 (Randomization 
and Blinding)  • Added: Randomization for 
Phas e 2 will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_399958] a COVID -19 booster 
(yes or no) instead of receipt of 
prior SARS -CoV -2 vaccine that is 
mRNA based.  • Per the main rationale of 
the amendment to allow 
study participants who 
have received a booster 
dose of a COVID -19 
vaccin e, this change in 
randomization scheme for 
Phase  2 is more 
appropriate.  
Sections 1.1 (Synopsis) 
and 2.2.2 (Clinical 
Studies)  • Deleted reference to a substudy to 
mRNA -1010 -P101 in the 
background sections.  • This substudy was 
cancelled and is no longer 
applicable.  
Sections 1.1 (Synopsis) 
and 5.2 (Exclusion 
Criteria)  • Exclusion criterion 13 was 
updated to the following: 
Participant has had close contact 
[CONTACT_76847] -CoV -[ADDRESS_789077] 
10 days prior to the Screening 
Visit.  • This change was made for 
clarity and to harmonize 
across Sponsor programs.  
Section 2.2.2 (Clinical 
Studies)  • Background information was 
added highlighting that an 
amendment is planned (for a 
separate study, mRNA -1010 -
P101) to assess 6. 25 µg and 
12.5 µg dose levels of mRNA -
1010 as well as 25 µg mRNA -

Sections 2.3.3 (Overall 
Benefit/Risk 
Conclusion) and 4.3 
(Choice of Vaccine 
Dose)  • Added mRNA -1010 immune 
response data to support 
benefit/risk discussion.  • IA data from the mRNA -
1010 -P101 stu dy showing 
tolerability profile and 
similar levels of anti - 
hemagglutination antibody 
responses across doses 
support the selection of 
mRNA -1073 at  
dose levels in 
Phase  1. 
Section 8.4.3 (Solicited 
Adverse Reactions)  • Modified Grade 2 and Grade 3 
solicited adverse reaction 
descriptions for injection site 
pain, axillary swelling or 
tenderness ipsilateral to the side 
of injection, and headache 
(Table  8). All of these Grade 2 
solicited adverse reactions are 
now described as “some 
interference with a ctivity” and all 
of these Grade 3 solicited adverse 
reactions are now described as 
“prevents daily activity.”  • These grade definitions 
were modified to more 
clearly differentiate 
between Grade 2 and Grade 
3 injection site pain, 
axillary swelling or 
tenderne ss ipsilateral to the 
side of injection, and

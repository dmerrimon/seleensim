To evaluate proportion of patients discharged home with a Foley catheter (i.e. failed voiding trials).  BACKGROUND  Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel; Pacira Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) is an extended release local anesthetic approved by [CONTACT_155320] [ADDRESS_179692] ambulation after surgery11.These findings reiterate the need for studies investigating a slow-release, longer-acting local anesthetic formulation for patients undergoing posterior repair and perineorrhaphy.  One that ideally can be integrated into an evidence-based, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing postsurgical pain management regimen to improve perioperative care for the steadily growing pelvic reconstructive surgical patient population.   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  This is a randomized, placebo-controlled prospective trial offered to patients undergoing posterior colporrhaphy and/or perineorrhaphy for pelvic organ prolapse at our institution.  The study will be conducted at two clinical sites:  1. Women’s Center for Pelvic Health (Mercy), Carolinas Health Care System, Charlotte, NC 2. Women’s Center for Pelvic Health Northeast, Carolinas Health Care System, Concord, NC  Human Subject Research and Informed Consent  Each participant will be required to sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent form prior to beginning any study-related interventions or assessments. The informed consent form will describe the study in detail. Additionally, the study consent form will disclose the planned uses of study data, as well as potential risks to the participants. Each prospective subject will have the objectives of the study explained to them prior to enrollment. The subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions and decide whether or not to participate. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_155289], and the originals will be stored with the research records for this study at the Mercy study center.   Subjects have the right to: • Voluntarily participate in the study 
4 • Withdraw or refuse participation in the study at any point without questioning • Understand the objectives of the study • Understand the risks and benefits of the study • Have their confidentiality maintained  Participant Screening and Point of Enrollment Participants scheduled to undergo possible posterior repair and/or perineorrhaphy will be identified and screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. If confirmed to meet the requirements for the study, they will be eligible to be invited to participate in the study.  Participants will be consented for enrollment into the study by [CONTACT_13922], fellow physicians, nurse practitioners, physician’s assistants, and/or a research nurse prior to surgery. Participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups at the completion of the surgical procedure and prior to anesthesia reversal. Provider and Clinical Staff Training  To ensure consistent infiltration technique, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_155290]-service education to all participating providers who will be performing surgery and incisional infiltration. Educational reviews will include medication pharmacology and specific infiltration protocol.  All clinical staff, including nursing and physicians, will receive in-service training about the study protocol and guidelines. Inclusion Criteria  1. Females age 18 and greater 2. Undergoing posterior repair and/or perineorrhaphy  a. Concomitant surgical procedures allowed  Exclusion Criteria   1. Planned regional anesthesia 2. Allergy or contraindication to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] a. Severe hepatic disease b. Pregnant/lactating  3. Allergy or contraindication to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 4. Allergy to contraindication to non-steroidal medications  5. Non-English speaking 6. Inability to provide consent/decisionally impaired  7. Planned laparotomy 8. Chronic pain diagnosis 9. Chronic narcotic use (daily narcotic use for ³ 3 weeks before surgery)  Study Withdrawal 
5 Participants may withdraw from the study at any point in time. Documentation of the reason for withdrawal will be captured in the data collection forms. There will be no risk to participants that choose to withdraw from the study. Preoperative Period All consecutive patients planned to undergo posterior colporrhaphy and/or perineorrhaphy will be identified, screened, and approached for participation in the study.  Concomitant pelvic reconstructive surgical procedures allowed.  Participants who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be considered screen failures. Screen failures will be captured and the cause for screen failure will be documented.   Perioperative and Surgery Period All participants will receive routine preoperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis based on standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53769].  All participants will receive standard of care induction and intraoperative analgesic medications as determined by [CONTACT_16826].  All patients will receive prophylactic antiemetic medications perioperatively as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_16826].  These medications will be documented in the patient’s medical record and available for chart review.  Intervention: Eligible subjects will be randomized using a computer-generated randomization scheme, with patients assigned in a blinded 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_155321], to either: Group 1: 20 mL liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_155291] 10 mL of injectable sterile normal saline solution (0.9%) for a total of 30 mL. Group 2: 30 mL of injectable sterile normal 0.9% saline solution (placebo). The allocation sequence will be in sealed, opaque envelopes. An envelope will be retrieved in the operating room.  The OR circulating nurse will assemble the appropriate intervention medication.  The envelope will then be disposed of while still in the operating room in a secure manner. Procedures will be performed by [ADDRESS_179693] the rectocele.  The vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_155292].  The endopelvic fascia is then plicated with a delayed absorbable barbed suture (2-0 V-Loc), a delayed absorbable non-barbed suture (2-0 polydioxanone, PDS) or a polyglactin (Vicryl) suture in either a running or interrupted fashion.  The vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_155293].  The vaginal skin is closed with a 3-[ADDRESS_179694] when possible to avoid pain caused by [CONTACT_155322].  At the completion of the procedure and prior to anesthesia reversal, the sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope will be opened by [CONTACT_155323], revealing the study group allocation. The surgeons will proceed with infiltration of either liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (intervention) or normal saline (control) depending on randomization.  Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_155294].  For this reason, surgeons injecting the study drug will not be blinded to allocation of study drug.  We feel this will not significantly impact our results as patients will remain blinded and study personnel collecting outcome data will also remain blinded.  Moreover, anesthesia will not observe the incision infiltration and will remain behind the patient drape. While the OR nursing and anesthesia team may see the difference in solution color, the subject and all other postoperative clinical staff (recovery nurses, floor nurses, and rounding physicians) will be blinded to study arm.  Furthermore, we anticipate collection of all data by [CONTACT_102]’s first postoperative visit, which is scheduled 1-2 weeks after surgery.  Therefore, data will be collected prior to patient receiving a bill for surgery so that if the bill is itemized to include the study drug, this will not interfere with study blinding.  Intervention infiltration: Subjects randomized to liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124195] (Group 1) will receive a single 20-mL dose of EXPAREL 266 mg expanded in volume with 10 mL normal saline (0.9%) for a total volume of [ADDRESS_179695] of care of infiltration of local anesthetic for this procedure but was also the technique used in prior studies evaluating the efficacy of short acting local analgesia at the time of posterior repair and perineorrhaphy11.  Injections will be performed using a 1.5” 22-gauge needle, which is consistent with EXPAREL packaging insert use.  Active control infiltration (placebo): Subjects randomized to the control group (Group 2) will receive 30 mL of injectable preservative-free sterile normal saline (0.9%), administered in an identical fashion as described above.  A placebo was used to control 
7 for anesthesia potentially induced from tissue distention3. Normal saline was chosen as placebo because pre-incisional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_155295], and we feel the addition of another common anesthetic would not likely add significant anesthesia compared to the pre-incisional bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  This is a similar study design to a prior study evaluating the efficacy of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_155296]3.   Vaginal packing is placed at the conclusion of the procedure in the operating room at the surgeon’s discretion.  Postoperative Period Following surgery patients receive a multimodal pain regimen, standardized by [CONTACT_155324].  This consists of ketorolac 15 or 30 mg every 4-6 hours; oxycodone with or without acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg 1-2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_33069] 4-6 hours as needed; or intravenous hydromorphone 0.[ADDRESS_179696] line, then metoclopramide if persistent nausea. These medications will all be documented in the patient’s medical record and available for chart review.  Participants will undergo a postoperative retrograde fill voiding trial per our division’s standard protocol prior to discharge – on postoperative day zero for outpatient procedures or on the morning of postoperative day [ADDRESS_179697] had a voiding trial. Discharge criteria will not be altered by [CONTACT_15365].  All patients are discharged home with prescriptions for ibuprofen 600-800 mg every 6-8 hours, oxycodone/acetaminophen 5mg/[ADDRESS_179698] postoperative visit. No other activity limitations are given.  Week 2 Postoperative Visit (+/- 1 week): 
8 Participants will be scheduled for a postoperative follow up visit, on average 1-2 weeks after surgery. They will be instructed to return their Patient Assessment Form including their pain medication diary, bowel movement diary, and VAS/NRS recordings at that visit.  Finally, they will complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire at this visit.  Randomization: A Carolinas HealthCare System biostatistician will generate a randomization sequence using SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).  A permuted block randomization scheme will be used to assign patients in a 1:[ADDRESS_179699] with the patients.  The commercial pharmacy will provide study medications - consisting of syringes containing either a 20-mL dose of EXPAREL 266 mg expanded in volume with 10 mL normal saline for a total volume of 30 mL or 30 mL of injectable normal saline solution (0.9%).  The study medications will be released by [CONTACT_155325].  At the completion of the procedure and prior to anesthesia reversal, the sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope will be opened by [CONTACT_155323], revealing the study group allocation. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT:  Case report forms will be developed by [CONTACT_473].  Data will be collected prospectively per the schedule in Table 1. All study data will be recorded by [CONTACT_155326].  The data flow will consist of paper data collection for eligibility assessment, baseline data, randomization, intervention group, primary and secondary outcomes, adverse events, and protocol deviations.  Data will be entered by [CONTACT_155327] a secure server at Carolinas HealthCare System.  REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing:  1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources.

Confidentiality of data  Electronic data will be stored to safe-guard confidentiality using a password protected computer.  Principal investigator, Co-investigator, Research Coordinator nurse, and statisticians will have access to harvested patient data.  Harvested patient data will be stored until final statistical analysis completed and manuscript accepted and published.  OUTCOME MEASURES  Primary Outcome Measure  The primary outcome will be assessed using visual analog scales (VAS) as well as numerical rating scales (NRS) to describe the patient’s postsurgical pain intensity.  The VAS is a validated 100 mm scale with “no pain” on the left equating to 0 mm and “worst pain” on the right equating to 100 mm. Subjects are asked to draw a vertical line on the scale that corresponds to their level of pain.  The NRS is an 11-point scale with zero being “no pain” and ten being “worst pain”.  The VAS and NRS scores will be collected by [CONTACT_155328].  The initial scores will be collected prior to patient transfer from post anesthesia care unit (PACU), then on the evening of postoperative day 0, and in the mornings and evenings of postoperative days 1, 2 and 3 – regardless of if the patient is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88072].  If the patient is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155299], their answers will be recorded by [CONTACT_127191].  If the patient has been discharged, they will fill out their scores in the Patient Assessment Form that will be given to them prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  A blinded research nurse or one of the study investigators will contact [CONTACT_155329]. We will also contact [CONTACT_155330].  The Patient Assessment Form will be explained to them at the time of study inclusion and again prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  See Figure 2.   Secondary Outcome Measures 
11  Patient satisfaction with pain control: This will be assessed using a Likert Scale. The Likert scale is a 5-point scale allowing patients to rate their overall level of satisfaction with pain control as “very unsatisfied”, “unsatisfied”, “neutral”, “satisfied”, and “very satisfied”. It will be collected at the patient’s 2-week postoperative visit.  If necessary, this can also be collected over the phone [ADDRESS_179702] opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]: This will be abstracted from the electronic medical record and recorded in minutes from the time patient arrives in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) as measured by [CONTACT_155331][INVESTIGATOR_155300].    Total inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]: This will be abstracted from the electronic medical record and recorded in morphine milligram equivalents based on the MAR.  This calculation will include intraoperative morphine milligram equivalents, as well as all morphine equivalents received in the post anesthesia care unit and inpatient floor prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].   Medication diary: Patients will be given a medication diary to complete at home as part of their Patient Assessment Form described above.  Patients will be asked to record the date and time of all pain medications taken.  We will record total milligram morphine equivalents and milligram of NSAIDs consumed at home during each of the first 3 postoperative days.  See Figure 3.   Antiemetic requirements: This will be abstracted from the electronic medical record and recorded in total number of doses received as an inpatient.   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]: The time from admission to discharge will be abstracted from the electronic medical record and recorded in hours.  Time in PACU: This will be abstracted from the electronic medical record and recorded in minutes.  Admission to PACU will be the time of first vital signs in PACU.  Discharge from PACU will be time of transfer to inpatient floor or discharge home.  First bowel movement: We will record the postoperative day during which the participant has her first bowel movement – as POD#0, 1, [ADDRESS_179703] bowel movement occurs during the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], this will be recorded by [CONTACT_127191].  Patients will record if bowel movements occur at home during the first [ADDRESS_179704] a bowel movement during this study time period. See figure 4.   Failed Voiding Trial: This will be abstracted from the medical record (voiding trial passed – yes or no). We will also record the date of passed voiding trial to determine how many days postoperatively this occurs (up until the 1-2 week postoperative visit).  If the patient 
[ADDRESS_179705] this as a voiding trial failure.  Adverse events: Any adverse event related to drug administration will be reported. Adverse events not related to medication administration will not be collected. We will however collect information on if patients are re-admitted during the study time period (yes or no).  Please refer to section on Adverse Events for details of reportable criteria.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41251]: We will record total direct and indirect hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680], including pharmacy costs for each patient in this study.  This data will come from Population Health department.   STATISTACAL CONSIDERATIONS  Statistical Methods  The data will be analyzed as intent to treat.  Descriptive statistics for all variables will be calculated by [CONTACT_2060] (intervention v. control).  The primary analysis will compare VAS at different hours postoperatively between study groups using Student’s t test if normally distributed or the Wilcoxon rank sum test if not normally distributed.  Secondary outcomes, demographics and other baseline variables will be compared between the two groups using the X2 test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data, Student’s t test for normally distributed data, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordinal data or continuous data that are not normally distributed.  Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess how participants who withdrew affect the results.  SAS® Enterprise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) will be used for all analyses. A two-tailed p-value of less than 0.[ADDRESS_179706] a 20mm difference on VAS scores between groups, assuming a power of 80% with a standard deviation of [ADDRESS_179707], it is determined that 32 subjects will be needed in each group for a total of 64 subjects.  SAS® Enterprise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) was used to calculate sample size.    Missing data may occur if subjects fail to return for follow-up. However, since study participants are undergoing surgery, they are more likely to return for their follow-up visits since these are a part of their standardized postoperative care. Therefore, this will decrease the rate of dropouts.  To account for a 10% drop-out rate, we will aim to enroll 72 subjects with 36 in each group.   STUDY DOCUMENTATION AND MONITORING  
13 Site Documentation All study documents included in this protocol that will be presented to subjects will be submitted to the IRB for review. The Mercy site will maintain a study binder for all sites that will include the following:  • Enrollment log of patients that have consented to be in the study (electronic version) • Protocol deviation log (electronic version) • Adverse event log (electronic version) • Investigator protocol and amendments • IRB submissions, modifications, and renewals • Data safety monitoring committee reports • IRB approved consent form • Data collection forms • Patient assessment forms Data Safety Monitoring The research coordinator will complete bimonthly reports detailing the study progress and subject status, any adverse events, and any protocol deviation.  The research coordinator will inform all study staff members of any unanticipated problems involving risks to study subjects or others.  The research coordinator will facilitate and participate in internal monitoring visits by [CONTACT_155332].  This will include a thorough review of research participant records, source documents, regulatory binders, and consent forms.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_155301]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_155302]’s decision to allow the trial to continue, in accordance with the IRB’s standard operating procedures and policies.  A protocol revision may be necessary for reasons including but not limited to rights, safety of participants, welfare of participants, and thus, an amendment will be required. Appropriate approvals (i.e., IRB) of the revised protocol must be obtained prior to implementation at each site.  The biostatistical team will generate periodic reports to monitor screening, enrollment, completeness of data for intervention implementation and outcomes, adverse events, and protocol deviations. Data safety monitors will serve as an independent body to review the study data on a regular basis. The data safety monitors will include an external physician and an external research nurse. Data and safety monitoring responsibilities will consist of review of the research protocol and ongoing study activities, including review of data quality and completeness, review of fidelity to the study protocol, review of adequacy of participant 
[ADDRESS_179708] ten patients are enrolled and randomized, the study statisticians will generate a report for the data safety monitors to review.  Content and frequency of the reports will be agreed upon prior to implementation of the trial.  The PI (Sarah Evans, MD) will be responsible for ensuring that the study complies with the data safety monitors’ requests.  Study Drug Information Medical Risks related to injection of local anesthetic, include but are not limited to, pain, bleeding, hematoma formation, infection, and/or lack of pain relief. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) following EXPAREL administration were nausea, constipation, and vomiting. Although these are common symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_155333]-operative period, we will monitor for excessive reporting of these symptoms.  Non-bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]-based local anesthetics, including lidocaine, may cause an immediate release of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_155303]. The administration of EXPAREL may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of [ADDRESS_179709] been reports of adverse neurologic reactions with the use of local anesthetics. These include persistent anesthesia and paresthesias. CNS reactions are characterized by [CONTACT_155334]/or depression. Toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conductivity and excitability which may lead to dysrhythmias sometimes leading to death. Allergic-type reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis and angioedema) are rare and may occur as a result of hypersensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients. The doses of medications in this study will be standardized and toxic doses of anesthetic therefore will be avoided to prevent the serious adverse reactions listed above.  Medical Benefits related to injection of local anesthetic: Improved postoperative pain control, reduced narcotic pain medication use and its related side effects, improved postoperative ambulation, possible shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], greater patient satisfaction. Protocol Deviations Protocol deviations will be documented and logged on the Protocol Deviations log (electronic version). This will be done for every protocol related deviation related to any portion of the study timeline. Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis, and, as necessary, appropriate corrective and preventive actions (including notification, re-training, or discontinuation) will be put in place. 
15 Data Safety Monitoring Data safety monitors will include an external physician and research nurse. They will be tasked to review all adverse events that occur. A semi-annual report of all adverse events will be generated and sent to the data safety monitors every 6 months. All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported to the data safety monitors via email within 2 business days of site staff being informed of its occurrence. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_155304]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_99606]-identified source documentation regarding the SAE will be included, as well as other clinically meaningful documentation. The PI (Evans) will be responsible for ensuring that the study complies with the data safety monitors’ requests. Reporting Adverse Events    Adverse events (AE) will be recorded and reported per the criteria and timeline below.   All AEs must be recorded and entered into the AE log and REDCap. An event number will be assigned by [CONTACT_155335].  The DSMB will be tasked to review all adverse events that occur. A semi-annual report of all adverse events will be generated and sent to the DSMB every 6 months.  All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported to the DSMB via email within 2 business days of site staff being informed of its occurrence. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_155305]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_99606]-identified source documentation regarding the SAE will be included, as well as other clinically meaningful documentation.  Reportable AEs include those determined to be related to the study medication. AEs not related to the study medications will not be collected. Please note that underlying diseases are not reportable AEs unless there is an increase in severity or frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be recorded as an AE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE.   Any participant that suffers an allergic reaction to the study medications will be unblinded. This will be a reported adverse event that will also be reported to the DSMB, as outlined above.   Adverse Event Definitions  Adverse Event: any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or any untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, whether or not related to study medications  
16 Serious Adverse Event: an adverse event that led to: • Death • Serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in o A life-threatening illness or injury o A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or body function  Unrelated: No evidence that the timing of the AE has a relationship to the time study medications were taken  Possibly Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the study medications, however a potential alternative etiology may be responsible for the AE  Probably Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the study medications and the causative relationship can clearly be established. No potential alternative etiology is apparent.  Severity Definitions  Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.   Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning.   Severe: Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  REFERENCES:  1.

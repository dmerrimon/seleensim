Juvenile -onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a chronic, debilitating pain condition that typi[INVESTIGATOR_604909]. Whereas medications offer limited and short -term symptom relief 
for JFM, our research group has demonstrated th at cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) is safe, effective 
and durable in reducing functional disability and depressive symptoms in adolescents with this condition. 
However, 60% of patients receiving CBT did not show clinically significant improvement in fun ctional 
disability, and pain levels remained in the moderate range despi[INVESTIGATOR_604910].  Objectively 
measured sedentary activity also did not significantly improve with CBT. Incorporation of a physical 
exercise component emerged as a logical next  step to enhance CBT, yet regular participation in any 
physical activity has been shown to be difficult to initiate and maintain in FM patients. In our prior 
research, we have documented poor movement competence, deficits in movement confidence and fear of  
physical activity as variables that likely underlie deficiencies in daily physical activity for teens with JFM. 
Our multidisciplinary team of experts in Behavioral Medicine, Rheumatology and Exercise Science has 
developed and tested the feasibility of a n ew Fibromyalgia Integrative Training program for Teens (FIT 
Teens), which enhances the established CBT intervention with a novel neuromuscular exercise training 
program derived from evidence -based pediatric injury prevention research. Innovative features i nclude - 1) 
neuromuscular training specifically designed to limit muscle soreness; and 2) seamless integration with 
CBT to enhance psychological copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], decrease fear of movement and increase physical activity 
participation. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_604911], no adverse effects and very promising 
early results indicating this treatment to have even stronger effects on disability and pain outcomes than 
CBT alone. This rigorous 3 -arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) will test whether the  FIT Teens 
intervention is more effective than CBT alone or graded aerobic exercise  (GAE)  alone and whether 
treatment effects are sustain ed over 1 year follow -up. We will also evaluate treatment mechanisms – of 
how changes in copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fear of movement, adherence, biomechanical changes  and physical fitness predict 
changes in disability and pain outcomes. Results are expected to have a significant impact on the clinical 
management of JFM.

1. PURPOSE OF STUDY  
 
A. Primary Objectives  
Aim 1 a: To test whether the combined FIT Teens intervention is more effective in reducing 
functional disability  (primary outcome) than CBT alone or GAE alone.  
H1a. The FIT Teens group will show significantly greater reduction in functional disability  at 3-
month  follow -up compared to CBT and GAE, respectively.  
 
Aim 1b: To test whether disability levels in the FIT Teens group are maintained at lower levels than 
CBT alone or GAE alone over time.   
H1b. Functional disability in the FIT Teens group will remain signifi cantly lower than CBT and 
GAE at 6 -, 9- and 12 -month follow -up.   
 
Aim 1c: To test whether more patients who receive FIT Teens achieve clinically meaningful 
improvement in functional disability compared to those who receive CBT and GAE.   
H1c.  A significantly  greater proportion of the FIT Teens group will achieve  clinically meaningful  
reduction in functional disability (defined as a ≥ 7.8 point reduction in FDI score)  at 3-month follow -up 
than CBT and GAE.   
  
Aim 2: To test whether the combined FI T Teens intervention is more effective  in reducing pain 
intensity  (secondary outcome).  
H2.  We hypothesize that  the FIT Teens group will show significantly greater reduction in pain 
intensity at 3 -month follow -up compared to CBT and GAE and that pain intensity in the FIT Teens 
group will remain significantly lower than CBT and GAE over time (6 -, 9- and 12 -month follow -
up). 
 
B. Secondary Objectives  
Exploratory Aim : To examine a mechanistic model of how treatment -related improvements in 
psychological (copin g, fear of movement, adherence) and physical factors (objectively measured 
physical activity, biomechanical changes and fitness) explain changes in disability and pain 
outcomes.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
A. Supporting Information  
 JFM is a chronic and disabling condition for which there is no cure. Pharmacotherapy has modest 
benefits and tends to be poorly tolerated by [CONTACT_604948]. Our research group 
conducted a rigorous RCT of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (R01AR050028) in which CBT was 
found to be efficacio us in reducing disability and alleviating mood difficulties in JFM.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_604912], with findings showing statistically significant improvement, when a

 higher bar of clinical significance was used, approximately 60% of patients who received CBT did 
not have sufficiently large gains in functioning to be considered treatment responders.  Also, while 
pain was significantly improved (average pain rating decreased from 5.7 to 4.9 on a 0 -10 scale), it 
remained in the moderately high ra nge. Moreover, patients did not show any increases in physical 
activity/exercise. Patients with JFM find it extremely challenging to incorporate regular exercise into 
their routines due to physical factors (e.g., deconditioning) and psychological factors ( e.g., fear of 
pain with movement). The newly designed FIT Teens program provides both the psychological 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_604913].  
There is empi[INVESTIGATOR_604914]. However, 
the benefits of exercise diminish because of poor adherence to regular exercise. In collaboration with 
experts Fin Exercise Science, we have discovered tha t specialized neuromuscular exercise training 
can be combined with CBT to offer a highly engaging way to improve adolescents’ ability and 
confidence in exercise by [CONTACT_604949]. The greatest benefit s of neuromuscular training are that it is designed to reduce muscle 
soreness and to improve strength, gait, posture and balance for teens to exercise safely. In a NIAMS 
funded study (R21AR063412), we have completed Phase 1 feasibility, acceptability and s afety 
testing of the new FIT Teens intervention which combines our established CBT program with 
neuromuscular exercise training (N =16 JFM patients). Not only is the treatment safe and highly 
engaging for patients, but initial efficacy results on disabilit y and pain are also very promising. In 
Phase 2 testing, we  are complet ed a single -site randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_604915] (N=4 0) 
comparing FIT Teens with CBT (N=20 in each group) at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Thirty -six 
patients completed treatment  (90% retention) and [ADDRESS_801141] if the combined effects of the FIT inte rvention are 
more powerful than CBT alone or a traditional exercise -only program (Graded Aerobic Exercise).  
 
B. Preliminary Work   
Randomized clinical trial of CBT in adolescents with JFM . The main objective of this completed 
4-site single -blind randomized clinical trial (R01AR050028, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_604907] -Zuck) was to test whether 
(CBT) was superior to fibromyalgia education (FE) in reducing functional disability in JFM. 
Participants were 114 adolescents (ages 1 2-17) with JFM.  After being stabilized on usual medica l 
care for [ADDRESS_801142] -treatment booster sessions (at 2 - and 4 -months). Assessments 
were conducted at baseline, immediately following the 8 -week  treatment and at 6 -months follow up. 
Retention was excellent (87.7% completing the trial per protocol) and there were no study -related 
adverse events. The results of this rigorously controlled RCT were that CBT was significantly 
superior to FE in reducing  functional disability (95% CI 1.57 -9.22; p = 0.007) with a large effect size 
for CBT (d = .85). CBT also resulted in a significant, but small reduction in pain (Mean reduction 
from 5.7 on a 0 -10 scale to 4.9 at the end of treatment; d = .22)1. This study demonstrated that CBT 
is a highly promising intervention for reducing disability in adolescents with JFM.  However, 
although the effect size for functional disability improvement was large, a secondary analysis using 
the Reliable Change Index as a cut -off for clinical significance (reduction in FDI score by ≥ 7.8 
points) showed that 60% of patients did not achieve clinically meaningful changes in disability. Pain 
reduction was also not sufficient to be considered clinica lly significant using a criterion of ≥ 30% 
improvement 2.  These findings highlighted the need for more powerful interventions to achieve 
RCT of FIT Teens for Juvenile Fibromyalgia  
Umbrella Protocol Version 15.[ADDRESS_801143] described above, we found that adolescents with JFM are 
very sedentary – mean of ~9 hours of sedentary/inactive time during daytime hours 3. Results also 
suggested that higher levels of physical activity were associated with lower pain levels and that 
older adolescents were more sedentary than younger teens. In the  trial reported above, we found 
that CBT intervention did not lead to any increase in objectively monitored moderate -vigorous 
physical activity, despi[INVESTIGATOR_397443]’ self -reported improvements in overall functioning 4. The high 
levels of inactivity found in JFM patients, even after treatment, is concerning. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_604916], these recommendations were clearly not 
being followed.  
 
Potential reasons for lack of activity engagement in JFM patients . In a recent study, we compared 
movem ent competence including gait, strength and balance in 17 JFM patients and 14 healthy 
controls (matched for age and gender) using highly sensitive biomechanical assessments including 3 -
D gait analysis. Participants completed tests of lower extremity streng th (isokinetic knee 
extension/flexion, hip abduction) and functional performance (walking at self -selected and 
prescribed speed, Drop Vertical Jump task) along with self -report measures of disability, pain 
intensity, depressive symptoms, and fear of moveme nt. Patients with JFM demonstrated mild 
deficiencies in walking gait and significantly lower bilateral knee extension and flexion strength (19 -
26% deficit), bilateral hip abduction strength (33 -37% deficit), and functional performance (Drop 
Vertical Jump: see Figure 1 for differences between JFM patients and healthy controls). Patients 
with JFM also reported significantly higher functional disability, pain intensity, depressive 
symptoms, and fear of movement relative to controls. These observations led us t o conclude that the 
levels of inactivity we previously reported were accompanied by [CONTACT_604950] (possibly due to more guarded movements and loss of strength/deconditioning) that may 
place patients at risk for pain during exercise. Their high levels of fear related to movement may also 
fuel further activity avoidance 5.

 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_604917] . Over several months in 2012, we designed the new FIT 
Teens intervention, incorporating a neuromuscular training component specifically tailored to the 
needs of JFM patients with our established CBT protocol. In 2013, we enrolled 16 adolescent s 
with JFM in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_604918], safety and acceptability of the FIT Teens intervention. 
Inclusion criteria were ages 12 -17, diagnosed with JFM and moderate or higher pain (≥ 4 on a 0 -10 
VAS). Patients were excluded if they had any other rhe umatic disease, documented developmental 
delay or any medical contraindication for exercise. We recruited ~50% of eligible patients 
approached for the study (Of the 17 refusals, 7 were due to distance, 8 due to time 
commitment/school conflicts and 2 to pur sue other treatments). Treatment was conducted in 
groups of 3 -5 patients and used an 8 -week, 16 session protocol (60 minutes per session). Adverse 
events (particularly any flares in JFM pain or other symptoms) were carefully monitored, 
attendance recorded at each session, adherence with the treatment in session and at home 
monitored via daily diaries, and difficulties with any particular exercise noted along with resulting 
modifications. At the end of treatment, patients completed a detailed individual semi -structured 
interview in which they gave feedback about the session content, format, perceived helpfulness 
and acceptability of the FIT Teens protocol. Interviews were coded for thematic content and this 
patient -oriented feedback was combined with staff an d therapi[INVESTIGATOR_604919]6. Briefly, the patien ts’ comments about the program were 
extremely positive, with patients reporting much better energy levels, feeling stronger and having 
greater confidence in physical activity, as well as improved mood and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Only one reported 
having a JFM flare which was reported as not being related to the treatment. A number of patients 
noted temporary soreness in specific muscles which they could easily distinguish from JFM pain 
and which resolved without intervention. Patients uniformly enjoyed the group format as well as 
the extensive support from the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/trainer as they progressed to new levels of challenge.  
 
Through an iterative process in Phase I testing, several changes were made to the FIT Teens 
protocol, namely, 1) later timing of sessions, i.e., after [ADDRESS_801144] with school 
times, 2) increasing the session length from 60 to 90 minutes to  allow ample time for CBT and 
exercise components, more education and review of home practice 3) several modifications to 
exercises to allow a range of fitness abilities 4) adding illustrated handouts about how each of the 
exercises related to daily functi onal abilities 5) addition of a sleep hygiene component 6) providing 
written instructions to help them remember homework exercises and 7) specific instructions for 
gradually increasing engagement in moderate -vigorous activity of their choice outside of se ssions 
to eventually build -up to [ADDRESS_801145] 2 times per week by [CONTACT_57627]. 
Patients and parents also requested periodic booster sessions to help with maintenance and to 
extend group support for continued copi[INVESTIGATOR_604920] t with the program. Of the 16 patients 
enrolled, 12 patients completed disability and pain measures before and after treatment. Mean FDI 
reduction after the 8 -week intervention was over 10 points (24.75 to 14.25) which was equivalent 
to effects seen in our  published CBT trial at the 6-month time point showing that these changes can 
be achieved much faster with the combined FIT Teens intervention. Moreover, 50% of the patients 
achieved a clinically significant reduction in disability (based on the Reliable C hange Index defined 
≥ 7.8 point reduction) at post -treatment. Based on our knowledge of CBT effects from our 
completed trial, we expect that the reduction in disability will become even larger over follow -up 
(with periodic booster sessions). Pain reduction  after treatment was small as expected (Mean VAS 
6.63 to 6.05), due to ongoing adaptation to the new exercise regime, but continued to decline over 
time as patients adapted to higher (self -reported) activity levels (based on phone -call follow -up 3-[ADDRESS_801146] FIT Teens group of 4 adolescents reported and average pain 
VAS of 4.75, a >30% reduction).  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_604921] (Connecticut Children’s). The research team 
from the Connecticut site visited Cincinnati in December 2013 for a 2 -day intensive training 
program in which they were trained in the FIT Teens protocol and biomechanical assessment 
methods. They successfully completed feasibility testing  of FIT Teens (N=12) in June 2015 with 
zero drop-out and no adverse effects. Preliminary results are consistent with the improvements 
noted above for the Cincinnati si te and a paper presenting the combined results from both sites has 
been published7. 
 
We recently complet ed a small -scale randomized trial comparing FIT Teens with group -based CBT 
(based on our standardized CBT protocol modified for group format).  Enrollment of 40 JFM 
patients using identic al inclusion/exclusion criteria as prosposed for this trial is complete and 36 
patients (N=20 randomized to each treatment arm) have completed the 8 -week treatment and 3 
month follow up (90% retention). There were no study related adverse events.  Initial results at 
post-treatment assessment suggest that the FIT group showed stronger reduction s in functional 
disability and pain than the CBT group (post -treatment FDI score = 18.7 in the FIT group and 23.9 
in the CBT group [p = .07]; and post -treatment pain 0 -10 VAS score = 4.69 in the FIT group and 
6.38 in the CBT group [p = .03].  Results have been submitted for publication. Objective 
biomechanics measures of hip strength and balance also show stronger gains in the FIT group.   
 
Aerobic exercise for adolesce nts with JFM . This small -scale RCT was conducted by [CONTACT_604951][INVESTIGATOR_175381] – Toronto 8 and informed the development of the 
(exercise -only) GAE interven tion arm for the planned U01. The study compared a 12 -week (3 
times weekly, 1 -in person and 2 at -home sessions) program for adolescents (8 -18 years old), where 
patients were randomized to an aerobic exercise (AE) or a qigong intervention. The AE program 
consisted of a range of graded low -impact aerobic movements (e.g., cardio -boxing) with a goal of 
building up to 30 minutes of exercise at or above 70% of their baseline heart rate, followed by 10 
minutes of gentle stretching. The qigong program consisted of gentle flowing motions combined 
with isometric holds and heart rate maintained at <70% of their baseline. The primary aim was to 
test the feasibility and safety of exercise interventions in JFM. In addition, assessments included 
fitness measures and self -report of pain, fatigue, functioning and quality of life. The aerobic 
program was found to be safe and well tolerated. AE was superior to qigong with respect to 
improving physical function, pain and fatigue but did not result in overall cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_604922]. This study demonstrated the feasibility of a graded AE program 
for adolescents with JFM, initial evidence of efficacy with respect to improvement in function and 
pain. However, similar to our CBT trial, daily activ ity levels did not improve even after aerobic 
exercise training and it is unknown whether patients continued to exercise after the treatment. The 
results of this study strongly suggest that an exercise -only program may be insufficient to achieve 
powerful a nd sustained improvements , likely because the psychological copi[INVESTIGATOR_604923], fear of 
movement and poor body mechanics were not directly addressed.  
 
  
RCT of FIT Teens for Juvenile Fibromyalgia  
Umbrella Protocol Version 15.[ADDRESS_801147]-treatment, 3 -, 6-, 9- and 12 -months follow -up. We will enroll up to 420 JFM patients ages 12 -
17 into this trial ( with at least N=105 randomized to each condition). Each treatment arm will 
consist of 16 in -person group -based sessions (or remote group -based sessions administered via 
video -platform during pandemic restrictions) held twice per week over [ADDRESS_801148]/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_604924]. Gr oup size will vary from 4 -6 JFM patients per group which has been found to be the 
ideal group size in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_604925]. Parents will be 
included in 6 of the 16 sessions and they will receive education about t he treatment and instructed 
in how to support the teen in their behavior change efforts outside of sessions to enhance 
generalizability to the home environment. After the 8 -week active treatment phase, participants will 
return for a total of 4 group -based “booster/ maintenance” sessions (according their group 
assignment) , or attend  booster sessions via remote video sessions , at 3 month  intervals through the 
follow -up phase in order to review their use of skills/maintenance of exercise and encourage 
continue d practice.  
 
The primary study endpoint is the [ADDRESS_801149] -treatment.  Participants randomized after 11/22/[ADDRESS_801150] 2 “booster/maintenance” sessions due to a 
reduction in the scope of work in this project  to complete the project expeditiously within the 
remaining timeframe and funding support.

criteria at the end of the screening visit (T1), they will be eligible for randomization in the 
trial. Each participant ’s parent  will be asked to voluntarily complete a brief survey about the 
family history of pain.  A waiver of documentation of consent  is included at the top of the 
survey form.  
 
The participant and their parent/legal guardian may be contacte d remotely (typi[INVESTIGATOR_244214]) 
to intiate the screening process for study. This remote communication will occur using a phone 
script which will explain and document that verbal permission is being obtained to collect the 
patient or parent/caregivers’s  email address and set up an online account  for collecting daily 
pain information used to determine study eligibility.  This online account will be used to collect 
daily pain diaries for 7 days leading up to the baseline assessment appointment. In these 
instanc es, informed consent will be obtained at the subsequent baseline assessment visit  (or 
electronically during pandem ic restrictions)  before initiation of randomization or 
commencement of any study interventions.  This process will increase study flow and redu ce 
burden on the participant/participant’s family  while determining study eligibility by [CONTACT_604956] a separate visit to obtain informed consent.  
 
D. Study Interventions  
Common Treatment Format:  To ensure equivalence of session frequency, session  format and 
contact [CONTACT_604957], each treatment arm will consist of 16 in -person  (or remote)  
group -based sessions held twice per week over [ADDRESS_801153]/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_604928]. Group size will 
vary from 4-6 JFM patients per group. Parents will be included in 6 of the 16 sessions and they will 
receive education about the treatment and instructed in how to support the teen in their behavior 
change e fforts outside of sessions to enhance generalizability to the home environment.  In instances 
where it is deemed necessary (e.g. COVID -[ADDRESS_801154] ), 
the treatment sessions will be conducted via  a remote visit  using a secure video platform  (e.g. Skype, 
Zoom , MS Teams ) with appropriate safeguards to ensure participant safety.   Treatment manuals 
have been specifically modified  so that participants can receive the same components of treatment 
but attend the group -based sessions in a home/private setting .  For remote sessions, psychology and 
exercise trainers from the local study site will conduct the sessions.  Back -up trainers from the 
primary Cincinnati site will be able to provide coverage for remote session/s i f a local trainer is not 
available.  W e will ensure that a parent or  other adult  caregiver  is physically present at the location  
in case any safety issues arise . If sessions are being conducted via remote format, participants will be 
provided with handouts  and basic supplies (Bos u balance trainer or portable heart rate monitor as 
needed)  following randomization .

 CBT: The CBT intervention will consist of training in psychological copi[INVESTIGATOR_604929]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_604930], 
behavioral strategies such as muscle relaxation and activity -pacing, and cognitive strategies 
including distraction, problem -solving and using calming self -statements. This group -based CBT 
protocol was used in the completed  R21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_604931].  
 
FIT Teens : Sessions will include training in pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_604932]. Participants learn to apply the CBT skills (e.g., breathing 
relaxation, activity pacing, distrac tion, calming statements) in -vivo as they learn new exercises and 
progress through increasing levels of challenge in the neuromuscular training program. The 
neuromuscular training begins with an introduction to the specific exercises with education about 
proper form and technique, the benefits of each of the exercises and relationship of each exercise 
with improved ability for performing daily activities – e.g., climbing stairs, walking briskly, sitting 
in class, waiting in line, bending to pi[INVESTIGATOR_604933] t. Exercises follow a specialized progressive 
resistive protocol that employs phasic progression based on the different muscle actions and their 
associated propensity for induced muscle pain and soreness during and after exercise. The four 
phase protocol i s systematically progressed from Level 1: Holding Movement Exercises, Level 2: 
Creating Movement Exercises, Level 3: Resisting Movement Exercises to Level 4: Functional 
Movement Exercises. The prescribed exercises, sets and repetitions will be individualiz ed so that 
they are attainable for each patient, and also modified as needed. Beginning Session 4, all 
adolescents are given instructions to gradually increase moderate -vigorous physical activity of 
their choice – walking, playing a sport, outdoor play, sw imming etc. beginning with 10 minutes 1 
X per week and working up to the recommended JFM guidelines of 30 minutes 2 X per week by 
[CONTACT_57627].   
 
GAE : This protocol was modified from a published study7 on the efficacy of aerobic exercise for 
JFM. W e will utilize a circuit -training approach (using an elliptical machine, stationary bicycle, 
treadmill and cardio/dance movements in rotation) with short intervals of exercise interspersed 
with brief (~60 second) rest breaks. If delivered remotely, partici pants will  be trained using a 
variety of floor -based  aerobic exercises that do not require  gym equipment.  Participants will be 
given a continuous heart rate monitoring device  during training sessions  and taught how to 
calculate their own “cardio -zone” for training. We will set the target heart rate to 50% -70% above 
baseline heart rate. These modifications were made based on feedback from authors of the original 
study that JFM patients had difficulty keepi[INVESTIGATOR_126580] a sustained [ADDRESS_801155]/motivation. The circuit approach with built -in rest breaks and 
slowly increasing the level of challenge is more suitable for this population because it has a more 
gradual and varied approach that is better adapted to t heir needs.  
 
Make -Up Sessions : If a participant misses a session, he/she will be asked to attend a make -up 
session immediately preceding the next regularly scheduled session (e.g., if the participant misses 
the first session of the week, they will be asked  to come early to the second session of the week). 
Make -up sessions will last for approximately 15 minutes; during which study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_604934]/or demonstrate exercises (when applicable) that were taught during the missed 
session  and shar e the handouts for the missed session . Attendance at make -up sessions will count 
towards attendance at a regularly scheduled session.

Umbrella Protocol Version 15.0  
 
   
15 
  
Maintenance Phase: After the 8 -week active treatment phase, participants will attend  a total of 4 
group -based “booster/ maintenance” sessions (according their group assignment) at 3 month  
intervals through the follow -up phase in order to review their use of skills/maintenance of exercise 
and encourage continued practice.  In instances wher e it is deemed necessary (e.g. COVID -19 
pandemic), the group based “booster/maintenance” session may be replaced with a remote visit 
(e.g. Skype, Zoom , MS Teams ) where the trainers  will contact [CONTACT_3445] s and review the use of 
skills/maintenance of exerc ise and encourage continued practice. Participants randomized after 
11/22/22 will complete only 2 group -based “booster/maintenance sessions due to a reduction in the 
scope of work in this project.  
 
E. Treatment Integrity  
Sessions will be video -recorded and an  independent evaluator will review  20% of randomly 
selected treatment sessions from each condition and complete a treatment integrity checklist to 
ensure there is no “therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332326]” or contamination of treatments.  Regular reviews of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_604935]  (held via conference -call format)  will be held to prevent 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_332326]. We have experience with this method of treatment integrity checking in our 
complete d trials with resulting high levels of treatment fidelity.   
 
F. Concomitant Interventions  
Patients will be asked not to begin any new treatments for JFM during the active treatment phase of 
the study and up to the 3 -month primary study end point. Medication c hanges during this time will 
be allowed if medically necessary and will be documented.  
 
At baseline, patients will provide self -report data on any JFM treatments (e.g. CBT, physical 
therapy, acupuncture, or aquatic therapy) and the dose received in the yea r prior to enrollment in the 
study .  The same information will be documented at each visit during the maintenance phase.  
 
Changes in prescription medication will be coded as a binary indicator of whether or not a 
medication change occurred. Non -pharmacolog ic treatments will be coded as a count variable 
computed as the product of frequency and duration. For example, if a participant reports receiving 
massage therapy twice a week (frequency) for a period of one month (duration), that participant 
would receive  a non -pharmacologic treatment variable value of 8. For the statistical analyses that 
test for maintenance of treatment gains following the 3 -month study intervention period, both the 
binary medication change variable and the non -pharmacologic treatment co unt variable will be 
entered into the longitudinal analysis model as time -varying control covariates.  
 
G. Adherence Assessment  
a. Atttendance at treatment sessions , including make up sessions,  will be recorded.  
b. Attendance to 12 out of 16 regularly scheduled sess ions (i.e. 75%) will be considered 
receipt of full treatment per protocol.  
c. Home practice of copi[INVESTIGATOR_604936]/or exercise will be recorded by [CONTACT_604958] a smart phone based application which will be modified 
to inclu de these items or a paper diary, in the unlikely even that they do not hav e a 
smartphone.

4. STUDY EVALUATIONS  
 
A. Study Assessments  
The following validated and developmentally appropriate measures will be used to assess physical 
and psychological functioning at baseline (T1), mid -treatment (T2) immediately post -treatment 
(T3), primary study endpoint (3 -month follow -up, T4) and 6 -, 9- and 12 -month follow -up (T5, T6 
and T7).  Participants randomized after 11/22/22 will not complete the 9 - and 12 -month follow up 
(T6 and T7). Specific time table for assessments is as below with X marks indicating when the 
measures will be administered.  
Self-report questionnaires (with the exception of the CDI -2 which will be administered in -person 
or via video -platform) will  be collected via REDCap data capture  to minimize need for in -person 
contact [CONTACT_604959].  Fitness, biomechanics and ac tigraphy assessments  will be 
completed only when it is deemed safe – based on each participating institution’s guidelines.

**Accelerometry   
Participants will be given a hip mounted accelerometer (Actigraph) for activity mo nitoring at 3 
timepoints during the study (T1, T3, and T4).  Prior to each assessment, participants will be asked to 
wear the device for [ADDRESS_801161] weekly treatment sess ion, and for T4, the 
Actigraph will be mailed to participants then collected at T4. The Actigraph is a small, non -
obtrusive, objective and sensitive measure of physical activity.  We successfully used the identical 
procedures for activity monitoring in our  completed clinical trial of CBT for juvenile fibromyalgia.  
 
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
A. Data Entry and Management  
The main study database will be housed at the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at the Cincinnati 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_604939] a centralized electronic database into which site coordinators will 
directly enter data from Case Report Forms  (collected either in paper -pencil format or via 
RED Cap). Medidata Rave® is a robust electronic data capture (EDC) platform for capturing, 
managing and reporting clinical research data that has been customized and built for th is trial. As a 
single platform, Medidata Rave® combines easy -to-use EDC and advanced clinical data 
mana gement capabilities.  Medidata Rave’s® extensive capabilities including wide support of 
industry data standards, flexibility to implement any data management workflow and a rich set of 
on-demand data extraction and ad hoc reporting tools provide a robust p latform to manage site -, 
patient - and lab -reported data from EDC and other third party systems.  
 
Databases for accelerometry and biomechanical assessments, which are both extremely data 
intensive and involve specialized software associated with the equipme nt will be stored in separate 
databases in a centralized location at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Once the data is cleaned, and 
pre-processed for analysis, the relevant variables will be merged with the final database for 
analysis at the close of the tr ial. 
 
 
RCT of FIT Teens for Juvenile Fibromyalgia  
Umbrella Protocol Version 15.[ADDRESS_801162] missing data including proper staff training 
and monitoring, as well as automated query resolution procedures for missing/inappropriate values 
in Medi -Data Rave® which wil l minimize missing data. However, we understand the importance of 
being responsive to missing data issues, and realize that the handling of missing data, including 
missing data due to differential drop -out raises some special considerations. We will try to  obtain 
as much information as possible to account for missingness including reasons for drop -out. 
Depending on the nature of missing data, we will use strategies consistent with best statistical 
practice, including but not limited to multiple imputation a nd maximum likelihood estimation 
methods with auxiliary correlate variables included to make a missing at random (MAR) 
assumption more plausible. For example, we will use a multiple -group comparison approach with 
an updated estimation algorithm (i.e., MLR or WLSMV) in the most current version of MPlus that 
enables the proper handling of missing variable data prior to analysis. The primary analysis will be 
intent -to-treat analysis.  However, in the case of differential attrition, if missing data not at rando m 
are suspected, sensitivity analyses under varying assumptions will also be conducted to reduce the 
potential for bias.  
 
C. Analytic Plan  
Analyses will be carried out on the full intent -to-treat sample as the primary analysis. Data analysis 
will begin with a review of all relevant variables  in the dataset. For continuous variables, 
parametric as well as nonparametric measures of central tendency, variability, and association, will 
be computed. Distributional properties of potential outcomes will be evaluated  and tested for 
normality where appropriate. Those differing markedly from normality will be considered 
candidates for transformation or alternative modeling techniques. Unless otherwise noted, α = 0.05 
(two-sided) will serve as the criterion for statistic al significance for all analyses.   
 
D. Rationale for analytic approach  
The design of this study is a multi -site RCT with 3 treatment arms (FIT, CBT and GAE). The main 
scientific focus of this trial is the efficacy of the treatments and maintenance of treatmen t effects 
over time. The treatments are designed to be group -based and patients will be randomized to 
receive treatment in small groups (clusters of 4-6 patients per group). We will recruit at multiple 
sites to ensure feasibility of achieving the necessary  sample size. There will be  equal numbers of 
patients in each of the treatment arms across sites (60 patients per site, 20 in each arm). Although 
site effects and effects of being assigned in particular “clusters” are not the primary focus of this 
study, we recognize the statistical issues that arise due to the nested nature of the design. The 
particular concern is of non -independence in outcomes among patients within the same group 
(cluster) and within the same sites regardless of treatment assignment. To handle the longitudinal 
design while also addressing potential bias that may influence results due to clustering, w e 
considered 2 approaches for analyzing the continuous outcome of functional disability – multi -
level modeling using a hierarchical linear mo del (HLM) approach and latent growth curve 
structural equation modeling (SEM). Both approaches can address the issue of clustering but an 
SEM approach was selected for several reasons -1) Longitudinal SEM & HLM have been shown 
to be equivalent analysis mod els, 2) a ‘group * time’ effect in HLM can be equated to ‘slope on 
group’ effect in SEM, and 3) although equivalent analysis models, research has shown SEM to 
have the greater statistical power.  
 
RCT of FIT Teens for Juvenile Fibromyalgia  
Umbrella Protocol Version 15.[ADDRESS_801163] whether the combined FIT Teens intervention is more effective in reducing functional disability  
than CBT alone or GAE alone. H1a. The FIT Teens group will show significantly greater reduction in 
functional disability  at 3-month follow -up compared t o CBT and GAE , respectively.  
Significant  changes in continuous FDI scores from baseline to 3 -month follow -up between the FIT, 
CBT, and GAE groups will be tested via a longitudinal SEM approach using the current version of 
MPlus  software. Groups will be d ummy -coded with FIT as the reference class; we hypothesize 
significant and positive ‘slope on group’ coefficients for CBT and GAE indicating a significantly 
lower FDI for FIT vs. CBT & GAE. Non -independence of FDI scores within participant clusters and 
within sites  will be addressed in three steps: 1.) declaring site as the complex clustering variable, and 
2.) estimating a saturated patient cluster -level model (i.e., estimating all possible covariances among 
FDI repeated measures variances at Level 2 so tha t, 3.) unbiased parameter estimates and 
significance tests can be obtained from the longitudinal SEM growth model specified at Level 1.  
The primary analysis will be intent -to-treat analysis.  Sensitivity analy ses may also be conducted to 
explore the impac t of the COVID -19 pandemic  (those who completed treatment prior to when 
enrollment was susp ended on March 12, 2020  and those who completed treat ment after enrollment 
was re -initiated in Fall, 2020 with treatment delivered via  remote format ). 
 
 
F. Aim 1b  
To test whether disability levels in the FIT Teens group are maintained at lower levels than CBT alone or 
GAE alone over time. H1b. Functional disability in the FIT Teens group will remain significantly lower 
than CBT and GAE at [ADDRESS_801164] whether group differences on FDI scores are maintained over time, a longitudinal SEM 
approach will again be used. Groups will be dummy -coded with FIT as the reference class. 
Significant and positive ‘intercept on CBT’ & ‘intercept on GAE’ coe fficients will indicate 
significantly lower FDI scores for FIT vs. CBT & FIT vs GAE at 6 -, 9-, & 12 -month assessments. 
Significant and positive ‘slope on CBT’ & ‘slope on GAE’ coefficients would indicate worsening 
FDI scores for CBT & GAE over time relativ e to FIT scores that have stayed the same or further 
improved. Any new treatments (medications or non -pharmacologic treatments) initiated during the 
follow -up phase will be entered into the longitudinal analysis model as time -varying control 
covariates . Nesting of clustered participants within sites will be again handled with the SEM model 
in Mplus described above.  
 
G. Aim 1c  
To test whether more patients who receive FIT Teens achieve clinically meaningful improvement in 
functional disability compared to those  who receive CBT and GAE. H3. A significantly greater 
proportion of the FIT Teens group will achieve clinically meaningful reduction in functional disability at 
3-month follow -up than CBT and GAE.  
 
Clinically meaningful reduction in disability is defined as a 7.[ADDRESS_801165] changes in the dichotomous (improved vs not improved) 
endpoints of functional disability from baseline to [ADDRESS_801166] of FIT Teens for Juvenile Fibromyalgia  
Umbrella Protocol Version 15.0  
 
   
21 
 independent proportions analyses for FIT vs. CBT & FIT vs. GAE testing H0: 50% of participants in 
the three study arms will achieve a reliable FDI decrease versus HA: 55% of participants in the FIT 
arm, and 35% -40% of participants in each of the CBT and GAE arms, will achieve a clinically 
significant FDI decrease.  
 
H. Aim 2  
To tes t whether the combined FIT Teens intervention is more effective in reducing pain intensity  
(secondary outcome). H2a. The FIT Teens group will show significantly greater reduction in pain 
intensity at 3 -month follow -up compared to CBT and GAE; and H2b. pain  intensity in the FIT Teens 
group will remain significantly lower than CBT and GAE over time (6 -, 9- and 12 -month follow -up). 
A similar longitudinal SEM approach as described in Aims 1a and 1b will be used to examine changes in 
1) the continuous pain inten sity VAS scores at the 3 -month primary endpoint and 2) VAS scores at 6 -, 9- 
and 12 -month follow -up to assess maintenance.  
 
I. Exploratory Aim  
To examine a mechanistic model of how treatment -related improvements in psychological (copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fear 
of movement, adherence) and physical factors (objectively measured physical activity, biomechanical 
changes and fitness) explain changes in disability and p ain outcomes.  
 
Tests of the mechanisms that influence functional disability and pain intensity outcomes will be 
conducted using a multiple path mediation analyses. 1) All possible indirect pathways between 
psychological mechanisms (copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], decrease d fear of activity, adherence) and physical 
assessments (biomechanics, physical activity and physical fitness) with the outcomes of  functional 
disability and pain intensity will be tested for statistical significance within each of the three (FIT, 
CBT & G AE) groups via bias -corrected bootstrap testing of all indirect pathways, and 2) The 
magnitudes of the indirect effects will be tested for statistically significant differences between the 
three treatment groups via a multiple -group analysis. The False Dis covery Rate will be used to 
maintain the nominal Type -[ADDRESS_801167] tests.  
 
J. Sample size and rationale (Power calculation)  
The primary outcome for this RCT is reduction in functional disability .  As such, the power 
calculations provided below are for the ability to detect whether FIT Teens results in significantly 
greater reduction in disability for Aims 1a, 1b and 1c.  
 
Aim 1a. Differences between groups at the [ADDRESS_801168], 5000 dataset replications of hypothetical FDI scores were generated in a multiple group SEM 
format assuming: 1.) standardization of FDI scores, 2.) no differences in the three groups at baseline  
due to randomization ( d = 0), 3.) group differences in FDI scores at [ADDRESS_801169] 
sizes from prior studies as follows: GAE ( d = 0.40), CBT ( d = 0.52), & FIT ( d = 0.90), and 4.) N = 
420 minus 20% attrition makes N = 336 ( n = 112 per gro up) available for analysis assuming proper 
missing data handling. Second, the 5000 Monte Carlo replications were then analyzed using a 
longitudinal SEM assuming linear trend (i.e., slope loadings coded 0, 2, & 3) with dummy -coded 
CBT & GAE groups (FIT = re ference). Results showed power > 0.80 if the standardized ‘slope on 
group’ coefficient for either CBT or GAE is β > 0.12 assuming proper handling of cluster by [CONTACT_604960].  With a revised sample size of  N=315 (n=105 per group), our re -

SEM format assuming: 1.) standardization of FDI scores,  2.) maintained differences between the 
three groups at 6 -, 9-, & 12 -months as follows:  GAE ( d = 0.40), CBT ( d = 0.52), & FIT ( d = 0.90), 
and 3.) N = 315 randomized (n = 105 per group) available for analysis assuming proper missing data 
handling. Second, the 5000 Monte Carlo replications were then analyzed using a longitudinal SEM 
assuming an  intercept -only model (i.e., slope fixed and random effects both = 0) with dummy -coded 
CBT & GAE groups (FIT = reference). Results showed power > 0.80 if the standardized ‘intercept 
on group’ coefficient for either CBT or GAE is β > 0.38 assuming proper handling of cluster by [CONTACT_604960].  
Aim 1c. Proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful change . 
We anticipate that the FIT Teens intervention will result in a greater proportion of patients achieving 
the binary outcome of clinically meaningful reduction in FDI compared to CBT and GAE. This 
difference is expected to be between 15% -20% based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_604940] ~55% of FIT and 35 -
40% of CBT groups achieving clinically meaningful change. The proportion of GAE patients 
achieving this binary outcome is expected to be similar to CBT. Power was calculated via G*Power3 
assuming 20% attrition and proper handling of missing data making n = 105 within the three arms 
available for analysis. Results showed power w ill be > 0.[ADDRESS_801171] 17% or greater (False 
Discovery Rate Type -1 error control will be used to evaluate results from both tests). A difference in 
proportion of ≥17% between FIT Teens and CBT or GAE will provide useful information for 
patients and providers about the relative efficacy of the interventions.  
 
K. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
This project is a Phase III multi -site randomized clinical trial  and a comprehensive data and safety 
monitoring plan is required. Th is project will be monitored by [CONTACT_604961] (DSMB) set up by a third party ( Navitas Clinical Research, “NCR” ) appointed 
by [CONTACT_4530] (NIAMS). Th e DSMB include s a panel of national experts completely 
independent of the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCHMC)  and collaborating sites and include s a 
physician, a psychologist, a biostatistician, and a safety officer. The DSMB Chair was appointed 
by [CONTACT_39129] .  
 
The DSMB Charter serving as a written agreement to guide roles and responsibilities of the DSMB 
members and the study team,  include s plans for 1) a DSMB meeting at study initiation to approve 
the Manual of Operating Procedures, Study Protocol, Case Report Forms, and monitoring of study 
progress (recruitment, randomization, drop -outs etc.) and safety and adverse event/serious adverse 
event (AE/SAE) reporting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. The DSMB will meet at least once every [ADDRESS_801172] NIAMS templates.  
 
Monitoring of Adverse Events (AEs) : During treatment, adverse events, whether or not they are 
thought to be treatment -related will be monitored and documented in seve ral ways.

 1. For the FIT Teens and GAE group, trainers will make note of any reports of increases in pain 
that persists for more than the expected temporary soreness with neuromuscular or aerobic 
training. These training logs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_604962]. In instances of  any reports of pain 
lasting >48 hours deemed to be beyond the expected temporary soreness or discomfort 
associated with initiating a new exercise , the study coordinator will be contact[CONTACT_604963] b e recorded as an adverse event.  If deemed necessary, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
primary site rheumatologist will be informed of the event.  
2. For patients in all groups, the study coordinator in consultation with the study physician will 
conduct a patient safety assessment at the mid -point of trea tment ( T2), the end of treatment 
(T3) and at the follow -up assessments, to document global assessment of s ymptoms and any 
adverse events.  
3. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (Exercise Physiologist and Psychology Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/Fellow) will be trained to note 
signs of increased pain  behavior and/or psychological distress.  In addition, any adverse events 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_604964] . The site coordinator will be made aware of the AE and will doc ument  
the occurrence as an adverse event. If deemed necessary, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or primary site 
psychologist will be informed of the event.  
 
Safety Reporting : Case report forms for AEs and SAEs have already been developed.  An AE 
documentation form will be completed by a clinician at every assessment time point, whether or 
not an adverse event has occurred and throughout the trial if any AEs/SAEs are spontaneously 
reported by [CONTACT_4317]. AEs include new events not present during the pre -intervention period  or 
events that were present during the pre -intervention period but have increased in severity. AEs will 
be re corded by [CONTACT_6764], preferred term, severity and relationship to the study.  The primary 
study team will meet weekly to monitor the progress of  the study and safety of participants in 
blinded fashion.   
 
Resolving Adverse Events  
Coordinators (CRCs) will complete Form V. Adverse Event Query Form prior to and during each 
assessment visit. Prior to the visit, the CRCs will document the ongoing AEs on  Form V. During the 
visit, the CRCs will prompt the participant/family on any updates, including inquiring if the event is 
resolved.  
 
The lead coordinator at the CCC will review all AEs on a bi -annual basis in preparation for DSMB 
meetings. Events which are ongoing will be reviewed with the site staff to review status for accuracy. 
Events which are considered “likely” or “definitely” rel ated to the study and are ongoing at study exit 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_604941] -up will be made on a case -by-case basis.  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) : If an AE is d eemed as a Serious Adverse Event, addition al 
details will be  compl eted on the  Adverse Event Detail CRF . The site investigator must notify the 
CCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the SAE occurrence or as soon as the SAE is discovered. The CCC PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_604942] (as appropriate) to review the SAE.  The 
DSMB Safety Officer and NIAM S will be notified of all SAEs through the Executive Secretary, 
Navitas Clinical Research Group (NCR) within [ADDRESS_801173] of FIT Teens for Juvenile Fibromyalgia

6. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION  
 
A. Potential Risks and Discomforts  
Injury, Pain, or Fatigue : During neuromuscular testing, the primary risks are related to potential 
injury from the measurement of isokinetic leg strength. Participants may also be at risk of injury 
from a fall or improper landing during the dro p vertical jump task (DVJ). Although the risk of 
injury during testing is real, ongoing studies utilizing these testing procedures in our laboratory 
have occurred over the past [ADDRESS_801174] reviewed and approved the neuromuscular and aerobic training protocol and provided 
their input to ensure that it is safe for use in this population.  
 
Emotional Distress : Asking the adolescent participants to complete self-report measures about 
their symptoms, physical and psychological functioning typi[INVESTIGATOR_604943] i n distress. 
However, given the risk of elevated depressive symptoms in some JFM subjects, some responses 
on the depression measure may reveal depressive affect and/or suicidal thoughts. The CBT 
intervention used in this study has been well -tested in past studies and has not been associated with 
any adverse effects.  
 
Confidentiality : There is a minimal risk that the data collected for each subject may be viewed by 
[CONTACT_230417].  The group -based treatment also presents a small risk t o 
confidentiality if participants share personal information outside of the group sessions.   Remote 
delivery via video -format also may  pose some concerns about confidentiality  if participants are not 
in a private location . 
 
     Note: Due to the COVI D-[ADDRESS_801175] Risks  
Injury,  Pain, or Fatigue : The minimal risk of injury involved in neuromuscular testing will be 
further reduced by [CONTACT_604965] -I’s who are 
experts in exercise science research and an active warm -up and stretching period prior to the tests. 
In the unlikely event of an injury during the testing, a physician will be on site to supervise and 
take appropriate action. Designated lab space and exam rooms will be used to protect each 
subject’s individual privacy throughout  the testing procedures. Exercise difficulty for both the FIT 
RCT of FIT Teens for Juvenile Fibromyalgia  
Umbrella Protocol Version 15.0  
 
   
25 
 and GAE treatment protocols can be modified to the participants’ abilities to minimize soreness 
and fatigue. Participants will also be allowed to take rest breaks during sessions. A study 
physic ian will be available at each site throughout the study to respond to any reports of JFM 
symptom flares or adverse events requiring medical attention, e.g., reports of severe pain beyond 
the expected muscle soreness related to initiating a new neuromuscula r or graded aerobic exercise.  
 
Emotional Distress/Suicidal Ideation : In the event that a participant reveals severe depressive 
symptoms or suicidal ideation (e.g. on the Children’s Depression Inventory), a licensed 
psychologist co -I at the site will be imm ediately notified. A risk assessment, including detailed 
information about suicidal ideation, intent and/or plans, access to means to hurt themselves, major 
stresses, availability of social supports, access to treatment, and plans for safety will be discus sed 
in detail with the patient and their parent. The assessment will be conducted by a PhD level 
psychologist. If the CDI is administered remotely (via video platform) due to pandemic 
restrictions, the site psychologist or institutional safety hotline ment al health worker will be 
available to join the video call for further assessment.  A referral to the ER (if necessary), and/or a 
referral to the Psychiatry Division or outpatient Psychology clinic, as appropriate, will be made. 
All actions taken will be do cumented in the participant’s confidential folder and documented on an 
AE form. The cognitive -behavioral component of FIT Teens will be delivered by a trained licensed 
psychologist or postdoctoral fellow. Our extensive experience using CBT for JFM over the  past [ADDRESS_801176] occurred.  
 
Confidentiality : All study staff are trained and certified in human subjects’ protections including 
protection of confidentiality. Confidentiality will be maintained through the use of subject 
identification numbers on all case report forms. All consent forms, contact [CONTACT_604966] a secure location within the PI’s research lab on a password -
protected computer. The primary study database will use the Medi -data Rave® platform which is 
the industry standard clinical trials software and will be customized to this study. This platform 
follows all the most updated good clinical practi ce guidelines for protecting subject information. 
All study data in the trial database will be entered with a Subject ID number only. The subject 
codebook and randomization schedule will be held confidentially by [CONTACT_15282] ([CONTACT_604971]) and the Regulatory Manager and will not be released until the data is locked down for 
analysis. Site coordinators will upload the video recordings on a restricted access server managed 
by [CONTACT_565124].  Site investigators will not have acces s to these videos no r 
will videos be linked to study data or a participant’s PHI.  Video recordings of the sessions will be 
destroyed every six months, once they have been reviewed and rated . Before they begin the group -
based sessions, adolescents and paren ts will be informed about the importance of confidentiality 
and will sign a confidentiality contract which affirms that they will not share any personal or health 
information about other study participants outside of the study group (including on any socia l 
networking sites).  
 
Note:  for the duration of the COVID -19 pandemic, group -based in -person sessions  will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_604967].  A ssessments will be minimized to brief  in-person  study 
visits (with most outcome measures collected el ectronically via REDCap surveys)  and only include 
procedures allowable by [CONTACT_133032]’s institutional policies.  At the beginning of each 
treatment session, a “safety check” will be performed which will include ensuring that participants

Umbrella Protocol Version 15.0  
 
   
26 
 are in a private location.   
 
C. Informed Consent  
The parent/legal guardian of each patient will provide written informed consent and the adolescent 
will provide written assent  with the option of obtaining consent on an IRB approved paper consent, 
or via REDCap e -Consent using a computer, electronic tablet, or smart phone . When e -Consent is 
used, consent and/or assent will be collected by a typed signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_604968]’s electronic signature [CONTACT_604970], a mouse, or a stylus, depending on the 
resources available to the family. Once the e -Consent form is signed, the parent or legal guardian 
will be able to download a PDF version and/or receive a n e-mail with a  PDF attachment of the 
signed consent form. This will all be conducted before any study measures and interventions are 
undertaken. If the adolescent turns 18 in the course of the trial, they will be re -consented using an 
adult Consent Form.  The parent of each participant will be asked to voluntarily complete a brief 
survey about the child’s family history of pain.  A waiver of documentation of consent is included 
at the top of the survey form.  
 
In instances where it is necessary to consent a parent/legal guardian and child remotely using a paper 
form, the child and parent/legal guardian will be provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_604944] (if applicable) to review prior to the call . Both the child and parent must be present 
remotely to participate in the remote consenting process. Study staff will review the consent (and 
assent, if applicable) documents with the family and provide time for the parent and child to ask 
questions and r eceive answers. The parent and child will sign and date the consent document(s) 
during the call. A copy of the entire  consent (and assent if applicable) documents must be returned to 
study staff (either electronically, digitally, or via postal mail). The c onsentee will sign and date the 
documents using the same date of the call. Documentation that the consent was obtained remotely 
will occur on the informed consent/assent and the informed consent process note.  
 
D. Participant Compensation  
Participants will be reimbursed $15 for transportation/mileage /effort  for each study visi t 
(participants residing greater than 25 miles from the treatment location  will receive $25 if they 
need to travel to the site for an in -person visit ) and $40 for each assessment. Those in the FIT 
group will receive a BOSU Balance Training Ball to facilitate  exercise training at home. The CBT 
group will receive a gift basket of relaxation CDs/software, squishy stress balls etc. to facilitate  use 
of relax ation and distraction strategies at home. The GAE group will receive a user -friendly 
activity monitor  and heart -rate monitor  to facilitate participation in aerobic activity.  
 
E. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Subjects and Others  
Based upon our prior work with CBT and exercise interventions, we expect that all adolescents 
(CBT, FIT, and GAE) will experience direct benefit including better ability to cope with their pain, 
as well as improved mood and functioning. We have published a rigorous rando mized clinical trial 
showing the benefits of CBT in reducing disability and mood difficulties in JFM. The enhanced 
protocol of CBT integrated with neuromuscular exercise training (FIT Teens) has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_604945] a safe and highly en gaging way to improve adolescents’ ability and 
confidence in exercise by [CONTACT_604949]. FIT Teens provides both the psychological copi[INVESTIGATOR_604946].  Graded aerobic e xercise has also been found to be feasible, safe and beneficial for 
RCT of FIT Teens for Juvenile Fibromyalgia  
Umbrella Protocol Version 15.[ADDRESS_801177] if the combined effects of the FIT 
intervention are more powerful than CBT alone or a traditional exercise -only program (GAE).  
 
G. Risk Benefit Analysis  
There is minimal risk  associated with participation in this study. The benefits to research participants 
include receiving an established evidence -based CBT intervention (in 2 of 3 groups) which is known 
to reduce disability and improve mood. Exercise interventions (neuromuscu lar training and aerobic 
exercise) have also shown early evidence of increasing strength, providing greater confidence in 
movement and improving daily functioning. Meeting and receiving support from other adolescent 
patients with JFM and obtaining more inf ormation about their pain condition have been uniformly 
reported as being highly beneficial by [CONTACT_604969]. Potential risks for injury 
during exercise testing are very small.  Although there is some risk for exercise induced/delayed 
onset muscle soreness which may be temporarily uncomfortable for some of the participants, the 
benefits of increased fitness, strength and longer -term pain reduction outweigh this risk. Information 
obtained from this relatively low -risk study will be extre mely valuable to establishing the evidence 
for behavioral and exercise -based interventions for the treatment of adolescent JFM patients and 
potentially impact the clinical care for adolescents with this chronically painful condition.

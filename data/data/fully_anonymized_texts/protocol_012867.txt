eliminate the PF-06700841 (brepocitinib)
active and corresponding ( brepocitinib )
placebo arms. Section 9.1: updated to 
provide power for comparison of PF-
06651600 (ritlecitinib) to combined placebo
only. 
Rationale: A strategic decision on the part of 
the 
sponsor to prioritize future development 
of PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib ), a JAK3/TEC 
inhibitor currently
 in development for a 
number of additional autoimmune diseases 
namely  ulcerative colitis, alopecia area ta and 
vitiligo .The decision to eliminate the 
PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )cohort 
from this 
study  B7981007 is not due to any  specific 
safet y, efficacy  or qualit y concerns that 
would negativel y affect the overall 
benefit/risk for patients in this trial or in
other t rials.
Protocol S ummary , Section 2 ,
9.1and9.2.1 
and 9.2.2: updated to change the primary  
endpoint during induction from CMEI  to

Page 23PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rationale:
The Janus kinase ( JAK)family  of kinases mediate ssignal transduction via interactions with 
typeI and t ypeII cytokine receptors.  Upon binding of the cy tokine to its receptor, the 
associated JAKs are activated and phosphory late each other and the receptor.  The 
phosphory lated receptors serve as docking sites for the signal transducers and activators of 
transcription (STAT )family  (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and 
STAT6) of transcription factors.  The STATs are then phosphory lated by  [CONTACT_22888] -localized 
JAKs, which stabilize homo -or heterodimeric STAT complexes that translocate tothe 
nucleus where they  bind to specific gene promoters and activate transcription of a range of 
target genes.
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) is a potent, selective, covalent inhibitor of JAK3/TEC .  It is an 
orally bioavailable small molecule that selectivel y inhibit sJAK3 /TEC by [CONTACT_168035] y 
blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP ) binding site,
without significant lyinhibiti ngthe 
other three JAK isoforms (JAK1, JAK2, and tyrosine -protein kinase 2 (TYK2 )).  
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) also inhibits irreversibly the ty rosine kinase expressed in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC )kinase family  (BTK, bone marrow t yrosine kinase on 
chromosome X (BMX), ITK (IL-2inducible T -cell kinase ), TEC, and ty rosine kinase 
expressed in T cells (TXK)) , with high selectivity over the broader kinome. The selective 
inhibition of JAK3 /TEC will lead to modulation of -common chain cy tokine pathway s, such 
as interleukin -7 (IL-7), IL-9, IL -[ADDRESS_195976] been implicated in the 
pathophy siology  of Crohn’s disease (CD).   Furthermore , invivo PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib )
will spare signaling of key immunoregulatory  cytokines, such as IL -10, IL -[ADDRESS_195977] CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells 
cytotoxic functions, which play  a role in the pathogenesis 
of intestinal bowel disorder ( IBD).
Taken together, it is hy pothesized that selective inhibition of JAK3 /TEC could be efficacious 
in treatment of CD.
PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) is an orally  bioavailable, small molecule, potent dual inhibitor of
human TYK2 andJAK1.   
JAK1 inhibition will impact the signaling of pro -inflammatory
cytokines such as Interferon ( IFN)-gamma and cytokines signaling through the -common 
chain receptor such as IL -7, IL -9, IL -15 and IL -21, while the inhibition of TYK2 will block 
the production of pr o-inflammatory  cytokines such as IFNand IL -17 through upstream 
inhibition of the IL -
12/T helper 1 ( Th1)and IL -23/Th17 pathway s
.  Taken togeth er, it is 
hypothesized that selective andcombined 
inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1 could be efficacious 
in treatment of CD.
Both PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) and PF
-06700841 (brepocitinib) are under development as 
induction and long-term therap y for the treatment of CD.

Page 24The original objectives of this study  were to evaluate the efficacy  [(based on clinically  
meaningful endoscopi c improvement (reduction of ≥3 points from baseline in SES -CDscore)
at Week 12 as assessed by  [CONTACT_18014] ], safet y, tolerability , PK, and PD of 200 mg for 
8weeks followed b y 50 mg for 4 weeks of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib )dosed once dail y and 
60mg of PF
-06700841 ( brepocitinib) dosed once daily  during an induction period of 
12weeks, followed b y a
n open label extension period at doses of 50 mg and 30 mg of 
PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib )and PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) , respectivel y, for 52 weeks.  
Amendment 5 of Protocol B7981007 revises the original design to eliminate the 
PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )and placebo arms and to change the primary  endpoint during 
induction from CMEI  to SES -CD 50 (to enable efficient comparison with c ontemporary  and 
emerging trials in Crohn’s disease). Therefore, upon approval of Amendment 5 by [CONTACT_168036], Protocol B7981007 will be conducted as a 
Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, paralle l group study  focused on the 
evaluation of the efficacy and safet y profile of the PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib )in subjects with 
moderate to severe active CD. All eligible participants that have been randomized to 
PF-06700841 (brepocitinib)/ PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib) placebo or currently  actively  
receiving PF- 06700841 (brepocitinib)/ PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) placebo under previous 
protocol amendments will continue to receive PF 06700841 (brepocitinib) through to 
completion. This study  modification is solely  a strategic decision on the part of the sponsor 
to prioritize future development of PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib ), a JAK3/TEC inhibitor 
currentl y in development for a of number of additional autoimmune diseases namely  
ulcerative colitis, alopecia areata and vitiligo. The decision to eliminate the PF -06700841 
(brepocitinib) cohort from this study  B7981007 is not due to any  specific safety, efficacy  or 
quality  concerns that would negatively affect the overall benefit/risk for patients in this trial 
or in other trials.

Page 29Study Design and Treatments:
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, multicenter 
study  in subjects with moderate to severe active CD.  The entire stud y consists of: 1) a 
screening period of up to 6- weeks, 2) a 12-week induction period, 3) a 52- week open label 
extension (OLE) period, and 4) a 4- week follow up period.  Approximately 230-[ADDRESS_195978].   Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria at the baseline visit will be 
randomly  assigned to receive either active or placebo treatments.   In the induction period, 
200mg QD (one a day )for 8 weeks followed b y 50 mg QD for 4 weeks of PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib )and matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio and for subjects enrolled prior to 
implementation of PA5, 60mg QD for 12 weeks of PF -06700841 ( brepocitinib )and 
matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio will be investigated.   The h ybrid dosing regimen for 
PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib) during the 12-week induction period is a consequence of available 
nonclinical long- term toxicity  data supporting 200 mg treatment for only up to 8weeks.   For 
analysis, placebo groups will be combined .
After the completion of the i
nduction period, subjects will enter the 52 -week OLE period.  
There will be no re -randomization at the beginning of the OLE period.   
Subjects will receive 
the same study  drug that they were randomized to receive during the induction period, and 
there will be no placebo arm s.  Placebo subjects from the induction period will also receive 
active drug in the OLE period. The matching placebo subjects from the double -blind 
PF-06651600 
(ritlecitinib) treatment /placebo induction period will receive 50 mg of 
PF-
06651600 (ritlecitinib) , while the corresponding placebos from the double- blind 
PF-06700841
(brepocitinib )/placebo induction period will receive 30 mg of PF-06700841
(brepocitinib )for 52 weeks. 
After completion of the OLEperiod, subjects w ill enter the 4-week follow up period.  An y 
subjects, who discontinues early from the double -blind period prior to theWeek 12 visit,
should undergo the procedures for an Early Term ination (Induction) visit on the last day  the 
subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possibl e thereafter.  For subjects who 
discontinue earl y from the 
OLE period (after the W eek12 visit, but prior to the Week 52

Page 391. INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory  bowel disease ( IBD)is a chronic inflammatory  condition of the gastrointestinal 
tract that affects five million people worldwide.  IBD presents as one of two major forms, 
ulcerative colitis ( UC)or Crohn’s disease (CD).  UC is characterized by  [CONTACT_168046].  CD is characterized b y discontinuous 
inflammation that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus and may be 
associated with long-term debilitating sequelae, such as fistulae and intestinal strictures.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_167992] , there still remains a significant unmet medical 
need ,as subjects can suffer from primary  or secondary  non- response s, as well as, 
development of intolerance to treatment regimens.   Because of the significantly  reduced risk 
for immunogenicity  and the potential for oral administration, small molecule inhibitors have 
emerged as an attractive therapeutic modality .  Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor with broad 
specificit y, mainly targeting JAK1 and JAK3 /TEC, with lesser effects on JAK2, and 
therefore affects multiple cy tokine signaling pathway s.  Tofacitinib has been approved for 
use in rheumatoid arthritis and has demonstrated significant differences in clinical response 
and remission between tofacitinib and placebo in subjects with UC (NEJM, 2017).[ADDRESS_195984] multiple selective kinase inhibitor assets simultaneously  in the CD setting, which 
in this trial will include a JAK3 /TEC -specific inhibitor and a TYK2/JAK1 -specific inhibitor
(enrollment into the TYK2/JA K1arm will conclude upon implementation of P A5)inthe
context of a single clinical study .  Each arm of the study  will address a biologicall y distinct 
question.  The JAK3/TEC -specific arm will address the involvement of cytokine s that signal 
through JAK3/TEC in CD , and the TYK2/JAK1
-specific arm address the involvement of 
cytokines that signal through TYK2 and JAK1 in CD .
Both PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib ) and PF- 06700841 (brepocitinib) avoid specific targeting of 
JAK2, thus reducing the risks of undesired side effects, such as anemia.
1.1. Mechanism of Action/ Indication
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib )is a potent, selective, covalent inhibitor of JAK3/ TEC that is 
currentl y being investigated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, UC, and 
CD. 
PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) is a potent dual inhibitor of human TYK2 and JAK1 that is 
currentl y being investigated in patients with psoriasis, alopecia areata, UC, and CD. 
1.2.Background and Rationale
The JAK family  of kinases mediate ssignal transduction via interactions with ty peI and 
typeII cytokine receptors.  Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, the associated JAKs 
are activated, and phosphory late each other and the receptor.  The phosphory lated receptors 
serve as docking sites for the STAT family  (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, ST AT5a, 
STAT5b, and STAT6) of transcription factors.  The STATs are then phosphory lated by  [CONTACT_42020]-localized JAKs, which stabilize homo -or heterodimeric STAT complexes that translocate
tothe nucleus where they bind to specific gene promoters and activate tr anscription of a 
range of target genes.

Page 40PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib )is a potent, selective, covalent inhibitor of JAK 3/TEC .  It is an 
orally  bioavailable small molecule that selectivel y inhibit sJAK3 /TEC by [CONTACT_168035] y 
blocking the ATP binding site without significantly inhibiti ngthe other three JAK isoforms 
(JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2).  PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib) alsoinhibits irreversibly  the TEC
kinase fa mily (BTK , bone marrow t yrosine kinas eon chromosom e X(BMX), ITK, TEC, 
and 
tyrosine kinase expressed in T cells (TXK)) , with high selectivity  over the broader kinome .
The selective inhibition of JAK3/TEC will lead to modulation of -common chain cy tokine 
pathway s, such as IL-7, IL -9, IL -[ADDRESS_195985] been implicated in the 
pathophy siology  of CD.  Furthermore , invivo PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) will spare signaling 
of key  immunoregulatory cytokines, such as IL -10, IL -[ADDRESS_195986] CD8+ T and NK cells cy totoxic functions, which play  a role in 
the pathogenesis of IBD. Taken together, it is hy pothes ized that selective inhibition 
of 
JAK3 /TEC could be efficacious in treatment of CD.
PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) is an orally  bioavailable, small molecule, potent dual inhibitor of 
human TYK2 andJAK1.   
JAK1 inhibition will impact the signaling of pro -inflam matory
cytokines such as IFN -gamma and cy tokines signaling through the -common chain receptor
such as IL -7, IL -9, IL -15 and IL -21, while the inhibition of TYK2 will block the production 
of pro -inflammatory  cytokines such as interferon-gamma and IL- 17 thro ugh upstream 
inhibition of the IL -12/Th1 and IL -23/Th17 pathway s.  
Taken togeth er, it is hypothesized 
that selective and combined inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1 could be efficacious in treatment 
of CD.
Both PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) andPF-06700841 (brepocitinib )are under development as 
induction and long-term therap y for the treatment of CD.
Additional information for these compounds may
 be found in the single reference safet y 
document (SRSD), which for this study  is the individual Investigational B rochure ( IB)for
each compound. 
Banked biospecimens will be collected for the purpose of conducting research; specific uses 
are described in the Banked Biospecimens section.  Comparing the deoxy ribonucleic acid 
(DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein, and metabolite variation patterns of subjects who
respond well and those who respond poorl y to treatment may help to better define the most 
appropriate group of subjects in which to target a given treatment.  Collecting biospecimens 
for exploratory  pharmacogenomic/genomic/biomarker anal yses and retaining them in the 
Biospecimen Banking S ystem (BBS) make it possible to better understand the investigational 
product’s mechanis m of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, 
exposure, tolerability , safety , and/or efficacy  not anticipated prior to the beginning of the 
study . 
Banked biospecimens retained in the BBS also can be used in research on IBD and othe r 
inflammatory  diseases.

1.3.Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism 
1.3.1. Non-Clinical Pharmacok inetics and Metabolism of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib)
Single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) were conducted 
after intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) administration to mice, rats, and dogs. Absorption was 
rapid and bioavailabilit y ranged from 61- 100%. PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) exhibited a 
clearance (CL) of 45 mL/min/kg in mice, 69 mL/min/kg in rats, and 13 mL/min/kg in dogs.  
The stead y
-state volume of distribution (V ss) was 0.8 L/kg in mi ce, 1.4 L/kg in rats, and 
1.1L/kg in dogs, resulting in terminal half -lives (t ½) of 1.3, 0.3, and 1.1 hours, respectively .
Systemic exposures of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) as measured b y maximum concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the concentration
-time curve (AUC 24) in repeat dose oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_167993], rabbits, and dogs. No sex -related differences 
and no significant accumulation was observed. In vitro, PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) showed 
high apparent passive permea bility  and preliminary  studies indicated that PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) was a substrate for P -glycoprotein 
(P-gp; also known as multidrug resistance 
(MDR )1)and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) efflux transporters.
  However, oral 
bioavailability  was high in rat and dog and a dose proportional C maxwas observed in clinical 
studies (between 5 and 800 mg) indicating minimal influence of efflux transporters on 
intestinal absorption. 
Fraction unbound of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) to plasma proteins was 0 .22(mouse), 
0.67 (rat), 0.29 (rabbit), 0.82 (dog), and 0.86 (human) across species.   Given the 
species -related differences in plasma protein binding, in vivo exposure -based safet y margins 
were calculated using unbound concentrations.   Following an oral do se of [14C]PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) to rats, radioactivity  was widel y distributed throughout the body with the highest 
concentrations in the uveal tract of the ey es, blood, and aorta.   The brain to plasma AUC 
from zero to the last timepoint (AUC t) ratio 
of [14C]PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) was 0.04, 
indicating minimal distribution of [14C]PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) -related radioactivity  to the 
brain, consistent with the drug being a substrate for P- gp/BCRP.
  Elimination of radioactivity  
was nearly  complete , since the majorit y of tissues were below the limit of quantitation at 
332or [ADDRESS_195987] -dose.   [14C]PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) showed high recovery (98.4%) 
when incubated for 4 hours with human hepatocy tes in vitro, indicating limited nonspecific 
interaction.
In vitro and in vivo metabolite profiling indicated that the primary  clearance mechanisms for 
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) were glutathione related conjugation and cy tochrome (CYP) 
450-mediated oxidation.  Renal excretion of parent PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) was limited in 
the rat and dog. Biliary  excretion of parent PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) was limited in the rat.
No unique human metabolites were observed clinically  compared to metabolite profiles in 
mouse, rat, and dog.   Initial metabolite pro filing in steady -state first in human (FIH) human 
samples based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption indicated PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) as the 
major circulating species at ~64%, with 3 glutathione remnant metabolites detected 
(~21% cysteine -, ~9.1% N -acety l cysteine -, and ~6.3% N -acetyl cysteine

mechanism.   The respective ratio of circulating cy steine, N -acetylcysteine, and 
N-acety lcysteine sulfoxide in rat:human was estimated at ~28:1, 22:1, and 0.74:1 comparing 
the 6- month good laboratory  practice (GLP) toxicity  study  no-observed-adverse effect 
(NOAEL) level of 200 mg/kg/day  to a top human daily  dose of 200 mg.  
The respective 
urinary  rat:human ratios of excrete d cysteine, N -acetylcysteine, and N -acety lcysteine 
sulfoxide were ~2.7:1, 19:1, and 6.4:1 indicating exposures of these metabolites in rats 
exceeded those in humans.  No evidence of chiral inversion of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) was 
detected in human plasm a following oral administration.   Reaction phenot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_167994]3A4 as the predominant CYP450 isoform 
responsible for the oxidative metabolism of PF- 06651600 (ritlecitinib) , with minor 
contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP3A 5.In addition, Glutathione -S-Transferase
(GST) -conjugate was formed in a time dependent manner in Recombinant 
Glutatione -
S-Transferase ( rGST) Mu 1- 1 (M1 -1) and Pi 1- 1 (P1- 1) incubations. 
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) showed a low risk of causing a drug -drug interaction (DDI) due to 
reversible inhibition of the major CYP450 enzy mes (unbound C max/50% inhibitive 
concentration [I C50] ≤0.04) as well as the major uridine 5' -diphospho- glucuronosy ltransferase 
(UDP) -glucuronos yltransferase (UGT) enz ymes (unbound C max/IC50≤0.07) at a maximum 
clinical daily  dose of 200 mg (unbound C max3.8 µ M).  However, in the presence of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) showed 
evidence of weak time- dependent inhibition of CYP3A4.  
PF-06651600 
(ritlecitinib) (caused 
>4-fold induction of CYP3A4 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels and >2-fold 
induction of CYP2B6 mRNA levels at 50 to 100 µ M, while no CYP1A2 induction was 
noted.  
Clinically , PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) showed no signifi cant changes in 
4-hydroxy cholesterol/cholesterol ratio relative to baseline controls following 14 days of 
dosing up to 400 mg once daily  (QD), indicating the lack of potent CYP3A modulation.   
Further clinical studies are planned to better understand DDI r isk. 
Based on in vitro transporter DDI assessments compared to exposure following a maximum 
clinical dose of 200 mg daily , PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) showed a low potential to inhibit 
organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, bile salt ex port pump 
(BSEP), organic cation transporter (OCT)2, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, and OAT3 at 
clinically  relative concentrations.   However, PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) has the potential to 
inhibit P -glycoprotein (P -gp) (s ystemicall y and in the gastrointestinal ( GI)tract), breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (s ystemicall y and in the GI tract), organic cation 
transporter (OCT)1, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)1, and MATE2K at clinically  
relative concentrations. Clinically , no significant changes in creatinine clearance 
(OCT2/MATE1/2K) from baseline were noted in multiple dose studies at doses up to 
800mg. PF-
06651600 (ritlecitinib) is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.

This Section is no longer applicable to newl y enrolled participants under PA5.
A single -dose PK study  with PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )was conducted after per os (PO)
andintravenous (IV) administration to male rats.  PF-06700841 (brepocitinib )was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y 
absorbed with high oral bioavailability  (approximately  100%).  After IV administration, 
PF-06700841
(brepocitinib )demonstrated a steady  state volume of distribution (V ss) of 
approximately  1.7L/kg and a moderate plasma CL (approximately  31mL/min/kg), relative 
to rat liver blood flow.  Systemic exposures (C maxand AUC 24) of PF-06700841
(brepocitinib )
after repeat oral dosing in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_167995].  In 
vitro, PF -06700841 ( brepocitinib )showed high apparent passive permeability  and 
preliminary  studies indicated that PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )was a substrate for MDR1.  
The mean fraction unbound values in plasma for PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib ) were 0.51 in 
mouse, 0.69 in rat, 0.36 in rabbit, 0.73 in monkey , and 0.61 in human. 
In vitro and in vivo metabolite profiling suggested that the primary  clearance mechanisms for 
PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib ) were through CYP450- mediated oxidation.  Renal and biliary  
excretion of parent drug was limited in the rat.  No unique human metabolites were observed 
in vitro compared to metabolite profiles in rat and monkey .  In vitro studies using human 
recombinant CYP450 enzy mes suggested that CYP3A4 was the primary  enzy me responsible 
for clearance of PF-06700841 (brepocitinib ), with minor contributions from CYP1A2, 2C19, 
and 2D6. PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )did not significantly  inhibit the m ajor CYP450 
enzy mes b y competitive inhibition or time -dependent inhibition in the presence or absence of 
NADPH (IC 50values >100 µM).  PF -
06700841 (brepocitinib )did not cause significant 
induction of CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4 enzy me activity  or mRNA expression at concentrations 
up to 100 µM.  PF -06700841 (brepocitinib )also did not inhibit the major 
UDP -glucuronos yltransferase (UGT) enzy mes (IC 50values >100 µM).  These results 
indicated that the risk of PF-06700841 ( brepociti nib)to mediate a CYP450 and/or UGT drug 
interaction at clinicall y relevant exposures was low (stead y state C max, u722nM at 
60mgQD).  PF -06700841 (brepocitinib )did not significantl y inhibit the organic anion 
transporting pol ypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (IC [ZIP_CODE] µ M) or OATP1B3 (IC 50>300 µM).  
However, PF -06700841 ( brepocitinib )did inhibit MDR1 (I C507.8 µ M), organic cation 
transporter (OCT) 2 (IC 501.1
µM), multidrug and toxin extrusion ( MATE) 1 (IC507.7 µ M) 
and MATE2K (I C5017 µM).  SimCYP®modeling indicated a low/small risk of a transporter 
mediated drug interaction with digoxin (MDR1; C max/AUC ratios: 1.17/1.08) or metformin 
(OCT/MATE1; C max/AUC ratios: 1.19/1.21) following a top dose of 60 mg PF-06700841

Page 63Following attainment of C max, the disposition of PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) generall y showed 
a monophasic decline at the lower doses of 5 to 200 mg (mean t ½of 1.1 to 1.8 hours) while a 
biphasic decline was observed at doses of 400 and800mg (mean t ½of 2.2 and2.5hours , 
respectivel y).  An apparent trend toward longer t ½values at higher doses (400 and 800 mg) is 
proba bly due to concentrations remaining above the quantifiable limit for a longer period of 
time at the higher doses and defining a later terminal phase.  In general, PF-06651600 
(ritlecitinib) AUC infincreased in a dose related manner over the 5 to 800 mg dos e range with 
a slightly  greater than proportional increase observed over the 200 mg to 400 mg dose range.  
Cmaxincreased with dose in an apparent dose proportional manner. 
The PK parameters following administration of 50, 200 and 400 QD and 100 mg and 
200mgBID for 14 days are summarized below in Table 2.
On Day 14 of multiple -dose administration, PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_168004] T maxvalues of 1 hour or less across the entire range of doses, from a total dail y 
dose of 50 mg (50 mg QD) up to 400 mg (200 mg BID or 400 mg QD).  Following 
attainment of C max, the disposition of 
PF-06651600 
(ritlecitinib) was consistent with that 
observed following single -dose administration, show ing a monophasic decline for the lowest 
doses and a biphasic decline following the 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD dosing regimens and 
a mean terminal t ½of about approximately  1.3 to 2.3 hours.  In general, plasma PF-06651600

Urinar y recovery  of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) was low, with approximately  <8% of the dose 
recovered unchanged in urine on Day 14 across all doses (geometric mean Ae % of 4.1% to 
7.0%).   Renal clearance ranged from 42.9 mL/min to 63.1 mL/min.
The relative bioavailability  of 50 mg PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) tablets was compared to 
50mg oral suspension in Study  B7981003.  The ratio (90% CI) of adjusted geometric mean 
was 93.4% (87.8, 100) for AUC infand 90.4% (72.2, 113) for C maxunder fasted conditions.  
When the 50 mg tablets were administered under fed conditions, T maxwas slightly  delay ed 
with a median value of 1.0 hours, compared to a median T max0.5hours under fasted 
conditions.   For the 50 mg tablets fed vs. fasted, the ratio of adjusted geometric mea ns for 
AUC infand C maxwas 102% (95.2, 109) and 61.5% (48.5, 77.8), respectively .
Pharmacod ynamic biomarkers response wasbest described b y an indirect response PK/PD 
model indicating that AUC rather than C maxis the important parameter to modulate disease 
response hence the recommendation is to administer the IP with no requirement regarding 
food in the current study . 
Following the first morning oral dose of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) 200mg to healthy  
Japane se subjects (B7981008) under fasted conditions 
on Day 1, PF- 06651600 (ritlecitinib) 
absorption was rapid with a median Time at which C maxoccurred (Tmax)
of 0.525 hours and a 
range of 0.500 -1.00 hours. Overall, exposures as measured b y Area under the 
conc entration -time profile from time 0 to time tau (A UC tau) based on geometric mean were 
3779 ng•hr/mL and for C maxof 1803 ng/mL on Day 1 after a single dose. Mean t ½was 
1.69 hours and it was calculated based on a 24 -
hour sampling. Mean appearanT clearance
(CL/F)was 53.0 L/hr and apparent volume of distribution ( Vz/F)was 129L.
Trough (predose) concentrations on Day s 4, 6, 8 and 10 for all subjects were below the lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ) (<1.00 ng/mL).
Following multiple oral dosing on Day 10,AUC tauincreased slightl y while C maxwas similar 
to Day 1. The geometric mean values for AUC tauand C maxwere 4983 ng•hr/mL  and 
1790 ng/mL, respectively . Median T maxwas similar to Day 1 with a value of 0.500 hours 
with no range for Day 10. Following t he attainment of C max, concentrations appeared to 
decline in monophasic fashion.  A short mean t ½was observed with an estimate of 1.8 hours. 
Based on AUC taucalculation, mean CL /F was 40.1 L/hr and mean Vz/F was 103 L.
Plasma PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) accumulation was 1.3 –fold for 
AUC tau(observed 
accumulation ratio ( Rac))and 0.99–
fold for C max(observed accumulation ratio for C max
[
Rac,Cmax]).  The steady  state accumumation ratio ( Rss)compares AUC taufor multiple -dose 
administration to AUC inffor single -dose administration.  The geometric mean R sswas 
1.3 (close to 1), suggesting linear increases in PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) exposure with 
multiple -dose administration. 

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196028] variability  in plasma PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) exposure on Day 1 and 
Day 10 based on geometric percent coefficient of variation (%CV) , ranged from 35% to 
43% for C maxand from 23% to 25% for AUC tau. 
Urinary  recovery  of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) was low, with <7% of the dose recovered 
unchanged in urine on Day 10 (geometric mean percent of dose recovered unchanged in 
urine up to 24 hours [
cumulative amount of drug recovered unchanged in urine up to 
24hours (A etau%)]of 6.89%).  Renal clearance was approximately  46.1 mL/min.
Study B7981017 is a Phase 1, randomized, open label, 2- way crossover study  to estimate the 
effect of multiple dose PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) on the pharmacokinetics of single dose 
midazolam and efavirenz in healthy  participants. Co-administration of multiple doses of 
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) increased midazolam exposure (AUC inf) and peak exposure (C max) 
by 2.7 and 1.8 fold, respectively . Efavirenz exposure ( AUC 0-72) and peak exposure (C max) 
were similar following coadministration with multiple doses of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) 
and single dose of midazolam and when administered with midazolam only .
Study B7981018 is a Phase 1, randomized, [ADDRESS_196029] of multiple dose PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) (200 mg QD) on single dose OC PK 
in healthy post-menopausal female volunteers. PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) decreased the 
adjusted geometric mean AUC and C maxof ethiny l estradiol around 18% and 12%, 
respectivel y. Systemic exposure of levonorgestrel did not show any  clinically  significant 
changes. The clinical significance of this decrease in ethiny l estradiol is unknown; however, 
efficacy  of estrogen
-containing contraceptives may  be decreased, and the concurrent use of 
an additional barrier method of contraception is required.  Female subjects who participate in 
clinical studies with PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) must agree to use contraception as defined in 
each protocol ( Section 4.4.1 ).

doses of itraconazole increased PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) total exposure (AUC inf) by 
[CONTACT_3450]  15% while peak exposure (C max) was similar relative to a single 30 mg

Inthe CO period: There were no deaths during the CO Period. Noparticipants discontinued
from the study or discontinued study drug due to TEAEs. Two participants (1 participant in 
each treatment group) had temporary discontinuation due to TEAEs (moderate bronchitis in 
the PF -06700841 ( brepocitinib )COtreatment group; moderate influenza likeillness and
moderate torticollis in the PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) CO treatment group). One participant

Study  B7931022 was a Phase 2b, POC, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled,
parallel group, dose ranging stud yto assess the efficacy , safet y and PK of PF-06700841
(brepocitinib )cream applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_168008]. Participation in this study  was for approximately 16 
weeks which included up to a 6 -week screening period, a 6-week treatment period, and a
4-week follow -up period.   Blood for determination of PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )plasma 
concentrations was collected prior to dosing at each visit.  In order to observe at least
224participants with 6weeks of data, 292 participants were randomized and treated at
70sites across 10 countries
.
The safet y population included 292 partic ipants with atopic dermatitis involving ≤20% BSA. 
73 participants were treated with vehicle and 219 participants were treated with PF-06700841
(brepocitinib ).
Treatment -Emergent AEs by [ADDRESS_196054] common reported AE in the 
study  was in the SO C Skin and Subcutaneous disorders and was worsening of atopic 
dermatitis. The majority  of the AEs were mild. 
Summary of Safety Results in Adolescent Population
Six male adolescents were enrolled in the stud y. Two were in the vehicle QD group and 
1each i n the vehicle BID, 0.1% QD, 0.3% QD and 1% QD groups.  
Out of 6 adolescents that were enrolled in the study, 3developed AE’s, which were all mild 
in severity . One adolescent participant developed neutropenia of 890/mL absolute neutrophil 
count at D ay 64 in 0.3% QD active group. The neutrophil count, which was borderline low 
at baseline level consistent with presumed diagnosis of benign ethnic neutropenia, 
subsequently  returned to the previous level. 
Two participants in vehicle QD group had AEs, 
one o f worsening atopic dermatitis from D12 to D19 requiring use of concomitant 
medication, and one burning with application of IP from D1 to D27, which spontaneously  
resolved. 
There were no deaths in the study .
There were no cases of malignancies.
Hematologic al disorders and other clinical lab results
Except for 1 adolescent participant who experienced decrease in neutrophil count to less than 
1000/mm3, there were no other hematologic abnormalities reaching discontinuation criteria.

131U/L (in 0.3% QD group, and the other 106 U/L in 1% BID dosing group (ref range 
9-34 U/L). Eight participants (5 in active and 3 in vehicle treatment groups) had m ild 
Creatine Kinase (CK) elevation >[ADDRESS_196056] and <[ADDRESS_196057], except for one participant in 
vehicle treatment group who had CK >[ADDRESS_196058], and there was no temporal or dose dependent trend. There were no clin ically  
significant trends in platelet, ly mphocy te, neutrophil counts, or hemoglobin, bilirubin, 
aspartate, alanine transaminase and creatine kinase levels .
Skin tolerability
Overall, the drug was well tolerated. The skin tolerability  is based on anal ysis o f AEs and 
skin tolerability  assessments. The study assessments were performed by  [CONTACT_168062] [INVESTIGATOR_168009], immediately before and after 
IP application. Reported AEs are presented in Results section above (SOC category : General 
disorders and application site reactions). The assessment of tolerability  at site of I P 
applications before and after the treatment showed that majority  of the participants had no 
evidence of local intolerability  after IP applicati on, with small number of participants having 
mild or moderate intolerability . The numbers of participants with mild and moderate 
intolerability  are comparable through different dosing groups. 
There were [ADDRESS_196059] documented severe intolera bility  to IP application that 
led to earl y termination. One participant in vehicle QD group developed severe intolerability  
to IP application on D ay 1, 1 in 3% QD group on Day  
4 and 1 participant in 1% QD group.
The study  met the primary  efficacy  endpoint . At Week 6 the percentage change from 
baseline based on the EASI  score was statistically  significant compared to vehicle with 
multiplicity  adjustment in 1 of 4 active QD treatment groups (1% QD) and in 1 of 2 active 
BID treatment groups (1% BID). The highest percentage change from baseline (75.0%) was 
observed in the 1% BID treatment group. Key secondary  endpoint results for the response 
rates based on IGA (clear [0] or almost clear [1] and a reduction from baseline of ≥2points) 
were statisticall y significant in all 4 QD treatment groups (0.1% QD, 0.3% QD, 1% QD and 
3% QD) and in 1 of 2 BID treatment groups (0.3% BID).

Page 84With the implementation of PA5, the aim of the study  is revised .  The study  modifications 
are based on: 
1.A strategic decision the part of the sponsor to prioritize future development of 
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib), a JAK3/TEC inhibitor currentl y in development for a 
number of additional autoimmune diseases namely  ulcerative colitis, alopecia areata 
and vitiligo ;and 
2.A desire to ena ble efficient comparison with contemporary  and emerging trials in 
Crohn’s disease. 
The decision to eliminate the PF -06700841 (brepocitinib) cohort from this study B7981007 is 
not due to any  specific safety , efficacy  or qualit y concerns that would negative ly affect the 
overall benefit/risk for patients in this trial or in other trials.
The total induction period for both assets is 12 weeks.  The 12- week PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) hybrid induction dosing is a consequence of available nonclinical long -term 
toxicity  data supporting higher 200 mg treatment for only  8weeks (a lower 50 mg dose is 
being used for the remainder of the 12 week induction period). 
Dermatologic rashes have been observed in the Phase 1 PF-
06651600 (ritlecitinib) studies.  
As the more severe rashes were associated with twice a day  administration, dosing has been 
limited to once a day  in this study .  The availability  of dermatology  consultation in this study  
is purely  a precautionary  measure.
Increases in serum creatinine have been obser ved in the Phase 1 PF-06700841 (brepocitinib )
studies.  However, nonclinical data suggest that this could be due to inhibition of a creatinine 
transporter in the proximal tubule rather than an indication of renal toxicity .  Parallel 
cystatin C assessments 
in the Phase [ADDRESS_196065] auditory  function were observed in the chronic dog 
toxicology  studies with PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) .  As the translation of this finding to 
humans is unknown at this time, a dose of PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) is being used for 
treatment after [ADDRESS_196066] been observed with drugs that inhibit 
IL-6 signaling.
  Therefore, lipid profiles will be assessed in the clinical programs.
Simvastatin is highly  metabolized in the gut and modeling based on in vitro data suggests 
that PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) time dependent inhibition of CYP3A may  result in a clinically  
relevant increase in simvastatin plasma levels.   Thus, simvastatin use with PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) is currentl y prohibited.  Since PF -0665 1600 (ritlecitinib) is metabolized by  
[CONTACT_097]3A 
moderate to potent inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A are prohibited ( Appendix 10).

All endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_168012] b y a central reader who will be blinded to study treatment.  
During the endoscopic evaluations, intestinal biopsies will be obtained and subsequently  
interrogated to provide evidence for pharmacological modulation of the JAK pathway s and to 
define parameters that might be used to enable a precision medicine strategy in future clinical 
trials.  Furthermore, the peripheral blood and stool may be profiled to provide correlative 
peripheral biomarkers that could complement the pre cision medicine discovery  in intestinal 
biopsies.
By [CONTACT_168063] a single study , the respective placebo groups can 
be combined, resulting in fewer subjects being exposed to placebo and a smaller overall 
study  size.  The inclusion of these two investigational drugs is appropriate as the target 
population and efficacy  outcome measures are identical for both.
1.6.2. Dose Rationale
The dose selection strategy  was designed to balance pharmacology  and safety  for this study  
with a [ADDRESS_196067] response modeling.  The magnitude of change in these markers 
required for efficacy  and/or safet y is poorl y understood.

healthy  subjects (B7981001) and under fasted and fed conditions (B7981003).   The predict ed

The predicted exposure during the induction period at the top dose of 200 mgQD for 
8weeks is projected to maintain 12 -and 14- fold safet y margins for C maxand AUC tau, 
respectivel y.  During the remaining 4 weeks of the induction period at 50 mg QD and the

AUC tau of 5-and 7 -fold, respectivel y.
In human whole blood lymphocy tes, PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) inhibited JAK1/JAK3 /TEC
dependent STAT5 and STAT3 phosphory lation by  [CONTACT_8668]-15 and IL -21 respectively , with IC 50
values of 56.5 ng/mL  and 103 ng/mL, respectively .  All other pathway s were inhibited at 
IC50values >571 ng/mL .  The inhibition (1 8-42%) of I P-10 is indicative of modulation of 
interferon gamma.  The predicted mean percent (%) inhibition of IL-15 was 44 and 81, 
respectivel y for the 50 mg and 200 mg. The corresponding values for IL -21 mean percent 
inhibition were 30 and 71, respectivel y for the 50 and 200 mg.
Pharmacological modulation of the target can be inferred from the predicted inhibition of 
IL-15 and IL -21.

The predicted exposure during the induction period at the top dose of 60 mgQD for 
12weeks is projected to maintain 7.2 -and 3.9- fold safet y margins for C maxand AUC tau, 
respectivel y.  During the chronic dosing period the 30 mg dose administered QD for

controlled, multi -center study  to assess the efficacy  and s afety profile of 200 mg QD dose of 
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) compared to placebo after 8 week treatment in seropositive 
subjects with moderate to severe active RA and an inadequate response to methotrexate.  
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) appeared to be gener ally safe and well tolerated in this study . No 
deaths or SAEs were reported. TEAEs were numericall y higher in the active group 
compared to placebo and were generally  mild in severit y. The most common TEAEs by  
[CONTACT_168065] I nfestations, Skin a nd Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders, Blood and 
Lym phatic S ystem Disorders and Gastrointestinal Disorders. There was one mild case of 
herpes simplex in the PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) group that was considered to be treatment 
related with no cases in the place bo group.
The Phase 2a stud y in subjects with AA is ongoing. However, draft data from an interim 
analysis at 24 weeks has been reported in this IB. The study  is a 
Phase 2a, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi- center study  with an extension period to evaluate the 
efficacy  and safet y profile of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) and PF-
06700841 ( brepocitinib )in 
subjects with moderate to severe active AA.  PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) appeared generall y 
safe and well tolerated. There were no deaths in the study .There were no subjects with 
SAEs in the PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) group. The number of AEs was higher in the placebo 
group relative to the PF -06651600 
(ritlecitinib) group.   The most common AEs were in the 
Infections and Infestations, Gastrointestinal Disorders, and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue 
Disorders categories, and the majority  of events were mild.
  No serious infections or cases of 
herpes zoster were reported in the study .  Hematological changes were observed in 
both 
active groups during the induction and maintenance periods, but were not associated with 
clinically  relevant adverse events.
Thesafet y profile observed during the Phase 1program for PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )
appears to be acceptable at dosages up t o 175 mg administered orall y as multiple doses over 
10daysin healthy  volunteers.
  A 28 daydosing duration was explored in psoriasis patients, 
who received the maximum PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )dose level of [ADDRESS_196070] treated with 100 mg PF-06700841 (brepocitinib )
for 4 weeks.  As with other immunomodulators, t he risk of infection is potential concern due 
to the i mmunosuppressive effects of PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib ).  To limit this risk, a 
maximum daily  dose of 60 mg will be used in this Phase 2 trial.  A chronic therap y dose of 
30mg was selected since this dose has demonstrated anti -inflammatory  activity  resulti ng in 
clinical efficacy in patients with psoriasis. 
Additional information for these compounds may
 be found in the single reference safet y 
document (SRSD), which for this study  is the individual IB for each compound. 
Banked biospecimens will be collected for the purpose of conducting research; specific uses 
are described in the Banked Biospecimens section.  Comparing the deoxy ribonucleic acid 
(DNA), ribonucleic acid ( RNA), protein, and metabolite variation patterns of subjects who
respond well and those who respond poorl y to treatment may help to better define the most 
appropriate group of subjects in which to target a given treatment.  Collecting biospecimens 

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196071] oratory  pharmacogenomic/genomic/biomarker anal yses and retaining them in the 
Biospecimen Banking S ystem (BBS) make it possible to better understand the investigational 
product’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, 
exposure, tolerability , safety , and/or efficacy  not anticipated prior to the beginning of the 
study . 
Banked biospecimens retained in the BBS also can be used in research on IBD and other 
inflammatory  diseases.
Providing these biospecimens is a required st udy activity  for study  sites and subjects, unless 
prohibited by  [CONTACT_168047] (EC) decision.

3.STUDY DESIGN
3.1.Study Overview
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, multicenter 
study  in subjects with moderate to severe active CD.  The entire stud y consists of: 1) a 
screening period of up to 6- weeks, 2) a 12-week induction period, 3) a 52- week open label
extension ( OLE) period, and 4) a [ADDRESS_196072].   Subjects who meet the elig ibility  criteria at the baseline visit will be 
randomly  assigned to receive either active or placebo treatments.   In the induction period, 
200mgQD for 8 weeks followed by  50mg QD for 4 weeks of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib)
and matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio and for subjects enrolled prior to implementation of PA5, 
60mg QD for 12 weeks of PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )and matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio 
will be investigated.   The hy brid dosing regimen for PF-
06651600 (ritlecitinib) during the 
12-week induction period is a consequence of available nonclinical long- term toxicity  data 
supporting 200 mg treatment for only 
up to 8weeks .  For anal ysis, placebo groups will be 
combined. 
After the completion of the induction period, subjects will e nter the 52 -week OLE period.  
There will be no re -randomization at the beginning of the OLE period.  Subjects will 
receive 
the same study  drug that they were randomized to receive during the induction period, and 
there will be no placebo arm s.  Placebo subjects from the induction period will also receive 
active drug in the OLE period. The matching placebo subjects from the double -blind 
PF-
06651600 (ritlecitinib) treatment/placebo induction period will receive 50 mg of 
PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) , while the corres ponding placebos from the double -blind 
PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )/placebo induction period will receive 30 mg of PF-06700841
(brepocitinib )for 52 weeks.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 94After completion of the OLE period, subjects will enter the 4-week follow up period.  An y 
subjects, who discontinue searly from the double -blind period prior to the Week 12 visit,
should undergo the procedures for an Early Term ination (Induction) visit on the last day  the 
subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possibl e thereafter.  For s ubjects who 
discontinue earl y from OLE period (after the W eek12 visit, but prior to the Week 52 visit), 
the procedures scheduled for an Early Term ination (OLE) visit will be performed on the last 
day the subject takes the investigational product or as soo
n as possible thereafter. These 
early withdrawal subjects, along with subjects who complete the induction period but are not 
willing to participate in the OLE period , will be asked to complete the Follow -up visit
approximately  4weeks after the last dose of study drug.
The original objectives of this study  were to evaluate the efficacy  [based on clinically  
meaningful endoscopic improvement (reduction of ≥ 3points from baseline in SES -CD score) 
at Week 12 as assessed by  [CONTACT_18014] ], safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, and PD of 200 mg for 
8weeks followed b y 50 mg for 4 weeks of PF -06651600 ( ritlecitinib )dosed once dail y and 
60mg of PF-
06700841 ( brepocitinib )dosed once daily  during an induction period of 
12weeks, followed b y an open label extension period at doses of 50 mg and 30 mg of 
PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib )and PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib ), respectivel y, for 52 weeks.   
Amendment 5 of Protocol B7981007 revises the original design to eliminate the 
PF-
06700841 ( brepocitinib )and placebo arms and to change the primary  endpoint during 
induction from CMEI  to SES -CD 50 (to enable efficient comparison with contemporary  and 
emerging trials in Crohn’s disease). Therefore, upon approval of Amendment 5 by [CONTACT_168036], Protocol B7981007 will be conducted as a 
Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group study  focused on the 
evaluation of the efficacy and safet y profile of the PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib )in subjects with 
moderate to severe active CD. All eligible participants that have been randomized to 
PF-06700841 (brepocitinib)/ PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) placebo or currently  actively  
receiving PF- 06700841 (brepocitinib
)/PF-06700841 (br epocitinib) placebo under previous 
protocol amendments will continue to receive PF 06700841 (brepocitinib) through to 
completion. This study  modification is solely  a strategic decision on the part of the sponsor 
to prioritize future development of PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib), a JAK3/TEC inhibitor 
currentl y in development for a of number of additional autoimmune diseases namely 
ulcerative colitis, alopecia areata and vitiligo. The decision to eliminate the PF -06700841 
(brepocitinib) cohort from this study  B7981007 is not due to any  specific safety, efficacy  or 
quality  concerns that would negatively affect the overall benefit/risk for patients in this trial 
or in other trials.

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196073] eligibility should be reviewed and documented by  [CONTACT_4653]’s stud y team before subjects are included in the study.

teratogenicit y/fetotoxicity  in animals (more details inthe IB) . 
Subjects who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  
with their partner(s) must agree to use 2 methods of effective contraception (at least 1 highly  
effective method) throughout the study  and for at least [ADDRESS_196089] andhis/her partner(s) from the list of permitted contraception methods 
(see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in their consistent and 
correct use.  At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities, the investigator or 
designee will inform the subject of the need to use 2methods of effective contraception 
(atleast 1 highly  effective method) consistently  and correctly  and document the 
conversation, and the subject’s affirmation, in the subject’s chart.  In addition, the 
investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately  if [ADDRESS_196090] or partner. 
Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1.Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation.

5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorizati on when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33). 
For this study , the investigational product(s) are PF -06651600 (ritlecitinib) and PF-06700841
(brepocitinib )tablets.
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology  (IRT) sy stem (interactive Web -based response [IWR]).  The site 
personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select 
information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the 
protocol number, and the subject number.  The site personne l will then be provided with a 
treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number 
when investigational product is being supplied via the I RT s ystem.
  The IRT sy stem will 
provide a confirmation report containing the su bject number, randomization number, and DU 
or container number assigned.   The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. 
The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact [CONTACT_110275]. 

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196092].  I f an investigator believe sthat 
immediate unblinding is necessary and time and circumstances allows, he/she is encouraged 
to discuss unblinding with a member of the study team.  Howe ver, discussion with a member 
of the study  team in advance of unblinding is not required.  When the blinding code is 
broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered on the case report form (CRF).
5.3.Subject 
Compliance
IP accountability  and compliance will be assessed by  [CONTACT_168070] 64.  Subject compliance will be verified b y 
the accounting of investigational product at each visit.   When investigational product is 
administe red at the research facility , it will be administered under the supervision of study  
personnel. 
Compliance of the IP will be monitored by  [CONTACT_168071] I P returned by  [CONTACT_168072].  Compliance will be documented on the 
CRF and source document.  Non -compliance is defined as taking less than 80% or more than 
120% of IP during the double -blind study  treatment and/or chronic therapy period(s) and as 
directed b y the dosing instructions, regardless of reason.   Subjects are to bring the blister 
cards and/or bottles with any  remaining study  drug to each visit for review.  The investigator 
has the discretion to withdraw any subject from the study  for reasons of non -compliance with 
the dosing regimen.  Investigato rs should indicate on appropriate CRF page non -compliance 
with study  treatment and provide an explanation.  Inventory  control of all IP must be 
rigorousl y maintained throughout the duration of the study  until all IPhas been accounted for 
and/or returned t o the sponsor.  Any  discrepancies noted between drug dispensing records 
and drug inventory  must be reported to [COMPANY_007].
5.4. Investigational Product Supplies
5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging
For the induction phase, blinded PF -
06651600 (ritlecitinib) and matching placebos will be 
provided as tablets in blister cards for oral administration.  For the induction phase of 
subjects enrolled prior to implementation of PA5, blinded PF -
06700841( brepocitinib )and 
matching placebos will be supplied as tablets in bottles for oral administration. The

requirements. 
For the open label extension period, PF- 06651600 (ritlecitinib) tablets will be supplied in 
blisters. For the open label extension period, PF -06700841 ( brepocitinib )tablets willbe 
supplied in bottles.
5.5.Preparation and Dispensing
The investigational product will be dispensed using an IRT drug management sy stem at each 
visit from baseline visit through Week56.  A qualified staff member will dispense the 
investigation al product via unique container numbers in the blister cards or bottles provided, 
in quantities appropriate for the stud y visit schedule .  The subject should be instructed to 
maintain the product in the blister cards or bottles provided throughout the cour se of dosing 
and return the blister cards or bottles to the site at the next study  visit. Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_196093] dispensing during public e mergencies if applicable.
5.6.Administration
Subjects will receive IP as outpatients.  PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) and PF-06700841
(brepocitinib ) tablets and matching placebo for oral administration will be dispensed in 
blister card s or bottles as described above inSection 5.4.1.  Subjects will be dispensed an 
appropriate number of blister cards or bottles sufficient for administration until the next 
dispensing visit and given clear dosing instructions. 
Sites will be trained on how subjects should take tablets at home through an I P manual and/or 
other vehicle(s).  Sites are responsible for communicating this information.
Subjects should take the IP orally  for [ADDRESS_196094] whenever possible even though 
IP may  be taken with or without food; howeve r, for study  visit day s, subjects are to be 
instructed to refrain from dosing at home, bring their blister cards or bottles to the site, and 
are to take the dose in the clinic from their current blister card or bottle . 
If a dose is missed and the interval to the next dose is less than 8hours, the missed dose 
should not be administered. 
During the induction phase, if subjects require discontinuation of investigational product for 
medically  mandated reasons (eg, following instructions from investigator ) for more than 
7consecutive day s at any time during the study , they  will be discontinued from treatment and 
should undergo the procedures for an Early Term (Indu ction) visit.
  During the OLE period, 
if dosing is missed for more than [ADDRESS_196095] should be considered for 
discontinuation following consultation with the sponsor and 
should undergo the procedures
for an Early Term (OLE) visit. Also, the subject will be asked to complete the Follow -up 
visit approximately  [ADDRESS_196096] be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including refrigerated, and/or room -temperature produc ts).  This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensur e that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations f rom the storage 
requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007]. 
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a 
protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational product after the 
temperature excursion.   Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Spec ific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site.
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where 
the products are briefl y out of the temperature range des cribed in the labeling are not 
considered excursions.
Site staff will instruct subjects on the proper storage requirements for take home 
investigational products. 
5.8.Investigational Product Accountability 
The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product supplies.  All investigational products will be 
accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record.

5.8.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational 
product (eg, at the site).  If destr uction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
[CONTACT_4618], and a ll destruction must be adequatel y documented.
Returned test article can be destro yed onl y after the sponsor monitor has verified the 
accuracy  of the dispensing and inventory  record.  The monitor must verify that site staff 
follows instructions regarding th e return of investigational product to the Supply  Chain 
Organization or vendor for destruction.
5.9.Concomitant Treatment(s)
All concomitant medication(s) and treatment(s) administered/taken during the study must be 
recorded with indication, daily  dose, and st art and stop dates of administration.  All subjects 
will be questioned about concomitant medication at each site visit.
A subject who is receiving metformin as concomitant medication must allow at least two 
hours after taking either medication and before t aking investigational product .
Medication(s) administered/taken following the first dose of I P will be documented as 
concomitant medication(s).
5.9.1. Oral Corticosteroids
Any oral corticosteroids taken during the screening and treatment periods of the study  will be 
captured on the appropriate CRF .
5.9.2. Permitted Medications
Subjects will be allowed to use the following medications as detailed below:
Concomitant use of oral 5- ASA or sulfasalazine.  Dose must be stable for at least 
4 weeks prior to baseline and through end of study  (Week68).  If oral 5- ASA 
treatment has been recently  discontinued, it must have been stopped for at least

(based o n their s ymptom’s) until the dose of prednisone or equivalent is 10 mg/day , 
then reduce the daily dose of prednisone or equivalent by 2.[ADDRESS_196097] to revert back to the 
preceding dose in the taper schedule (ie, “step up”). The signs or s ymptoms leading 
to this change (e g, increased stool frequency , increased rectal bleeding) must be 
recorded on the CRF. Study subjects with signs or sy mptoms attributed to 
corticosteroid taper are permitted to step up their corticosteroid dosage one time
during stud y participation and then resume corticosteroid taper to achieve steroid -free 
status.  Subjects requiring a second step up in corticosteroid usage will be required to 
discontinue the study .See Appendix 11for guidance on steroid equivalency.

section.
6.4.Subject Withdrawal
Withdrawal of consent :
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment wi ll remain in the study  and 
continue to be followed for protocol specified early  term procedures.  The only  exception to 
this is when a subject specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact [CONTACT_168075].  Subjects should 
notify  the investigator in writi ng of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up, 
whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical 
records b y the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is onl y from further receipt of 
investigation al product or also from stud y procedures and/or post treatment study follow -up, 
and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status (whether the subject is 
alive or dead) is being measured, publicl y available information should be used to determine 
vital status only  as appropriately  directed in accordance with local law.
Any subjects, who discontinue searly from the double -blind induction period prior to the 
Week 12 visit, should undergo the procedures for an Early Term (Induction) visi t on the last 
day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possibl e thereafter.   For 
subjects who discontinue earl y from theOLE period (after the W eek12 visit, but prior to the 
Week 68visit), the procedures scheduled for an Early  Term (OLE) visit will be performed on 
the last day  the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter.
After an y discontinuation, subjects will be asked to complete the 
Follow -up visit 
approximately  [ADDRESS_196103] to f ollow -
up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow -up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084].  Lost 
to follow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_168076] a minimum of [ADDRESS_196104]’s medical records.  If it is 
determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally  permissible methods to obtain 
the date and cause of death.  I f the investigator’s use of a third -party representative to assist 
in the follow -up portion of the study  has been included in the subject’s informed consent, 
then the investigator may use a sponsor- retained third -party representative to assist site staff 
with obtaining the subject’s contact [CONTACT_168077]-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196105]’s medical records.
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sp onsor for safety  (see also the 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the 
inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_168078]’s medical record.  In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational 
product(s), req uest that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with 
the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs).
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no furthe r evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
6.5.Guidelines for Monitoring and Discontinuations
The following laboratory abnormalities require monitoring and re -testing ideally  within 
3-5days, except as noted below when a shorter re- testing period is required :
Absolute neutrophil counts <1.2 x 109/L (<1200 /mm3).
Hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL.

7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However ,it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessar y to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject. When a protocol -required test cannot be performed ,the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
heor she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner .

7.1.2. Creatinine and Cystatin C
Serum creatinine is the best known standard test for monitoring renal function.  However, 
serum creatinine based estimates of glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) may  be affected b y 
factors other than renal function, including chronic and acute illness.   Cystatin C is a test that 
can be used either as an adjunct to or as a replacement for serum creatinine.  The most 
reliable estimates of GFR use both test results .[ADDRESS_196111] ion.3,4  While use of cystatin C has been limited, its independence of demographic 
factors (eg, race) has made it an interesting means of determining changes in renal function 
in clinical settings an d it is included in the 2012 Kidney  Disease: Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.  Estimated GFR may  be calculated via the 2012 CKD -EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_10426], cy statin C, or creatinine -cystatin C equations.5
Serum creatinine will be measured and creatinine based eGFR will be calculated at times 
specified in the Schedule of Activities . Serum cy statin Cwill be measured and cy statinC 
based eGFR will be calculated at times specified in the Schedule of Activities. 
7.1.3. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate
Serum creatinine and serum cy statin -
C based estimated GFR (eGFR) will be calculated at 
times specified in the Schedule of activities , in order to facilitate calculation of eGFR at these 
time points.  Corresponding serum creatinine and cystatin -C based eGFR will be determined 
to assess renal function. 
The estimated GFR (eGFR) will be calculated using the 2 sets of equations developed by  [CONTACT_95480][INVESTIGATOR_8849] (CKD -EPI), which utilize serum 
creatinine (SCr) and serum Cy statin C (S Cy statin C) respectivel y.[ADDRESS_196112] 25 mIU/mL  and must be performed by  a certified laboratory .  For female subjects of 
childbearing potential, [ADDRESS_196113] ([ADDRESS_196114] administration).  Fo llowing a negative pregnancy  
test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and the second 
negative pregnancy  test result will then be required at the baseline visit before the subject 
may receive the investigational product.  In the absence of regular menstrual bleeding, the 
study  candidate should have used [ADDRESS_196115] has not become pregnant during the stud y.  Pregnancy  tests 
will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed and when potential pregnancy  is 
otherwise suspected, and may  be repeated if requested by  [CONTACT_110453] 
(IRBs)/ethics c ommittees (ECs) or if required b y local regulations.  In the case of a positive 
confirmed pregnancy , the subject will be withdrawn from administration of investigational 
product but will remain in the study  in follow -up. 
7.1.5. Interferon Gamma Release Assay Tuberculin Test
Subjects may  be screened for TB using an IGRA per local guidelines.   IGRA will be used 
locally  (where feasible) during screening or within [ADDRESS_196116] for 
active/latent tuberculosis (TB ).  The following are acceptable assay s: QuantiFERON®-TB 
Gold test (QFT -G), QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In -Tube test (QFT -GIT) and T -SPOT®TB 
test. Covance tests that replace the above specified tests are permitted .  Blood sampling may  
include [ADDRESS_196117], used should 
comply  with local country -specific guidelines.
  The ty pe (name) and results of the IGRA TB 
test must be known and located in source documenta tion. 
Subjects with a documented positive I GRA TB test performed within [ADDRESS_196118] that determines low risk of 
infection (ie, subject would be acceptable for immunosuppr essant (eg, anti -TNF) treatment 
without additional action).
The sample(s) will be analy zed by  [CONTACT_779]’s local laboratory .  Refer to local lab for an y 
additional processing information and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].
7.1.6. Screening for Clostridium Difficile
C.difficile testing is performed at screening and during the stud y when there is a suspected 
disease flare or gastroenteritis.  C.difficile infection in these settings requires treatment as 
determined b y the PI. Subjects with Clostridium difficile infection may be treated and 
re-tested or re -screened at the discretion of the Investigator.
Highl y sensitive screening tests, with high negative predictive value, should be employ ed in 
evaluating subjects for eligibility  for the study .  The detection of C.difficile by [CONTACT_168079] (stool culture followed b y detection of toxin) is considered the gold standard for 
the diagnosis of the colonization or infection with pathogenic C.difficile .  Comparable

(GDH) antigen on a card.  Use of the card for point of care screening is encouraged where 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1295].  Molecu lar techniques such as pol ymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) for detection of toxin RNA are also acceptable alternatives. 
Refer to the lab manual for further guidance and instruction for C.difficile screening.
7.1.7. Infections
Subjects will be monitored for development of any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal).  
Infections will be classified as either treated or non -treated infections.  All treated infections 
occurring during the study should be cultured if feasible and the results (eg, any  identified 
organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Treated infections are infections that:
Require antimicrobial therap y by [CONTACT_110454]; 
Require an y surgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage).
Treated infections will be further classifi ed as serious or non- serious.  Serious infections are 
treated infections that:
Require parenteral antimicrobial therap y and present with positive pre -treatment 
culture ;
AND EITHER
Require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476] ;
OR
Meet other criteria that requir e the infection to be classified as a SAE.
A subject who experiences a serious infection should be discontinued from the study .  A 
serious infection should be reported as a SAE and should be listed as the reason for 
discontinuation in the CRF.  All serious infections occurring during the study  should undergo 
appropriate laboratory investigations, including culture, and the results (eg, any  identified 
organisms or absence of growth) be recorded in the CRF.
Subjects who experience non- serious infections that require treatment may  have their study  
drug temporaril y discontinued during treatment at the investigator’s discretion.  Consultation 
with the [COMPANY_007] medical monitor is available.  Temporary  discontinuation of study  drug 
should be recorded in the CRF.

Blood samples for the analy sis of viral load for Cy tomegalovirus ( CMV ), Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV ), 
Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV1 ), HSV2 and Varicella Zoster Virus ( VZV ) will be 
collected according to the times outlined in the Schedule of Activities .  Additional sample 
collection instructions will be provided in the lab manual. 
Note: Due to long turnaround time, the reporting time of these labs could be quite delay ed.
In addition to time points specified, a plasma sample for viral surveillance sample may  also 
be taken at the time of an adverse event , as clinically  appropriate.
7.1.9. Vital Signs (Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, and Temperature)
Blood pressure will be measured in the subject’s dominant arm and recorded to the 
nearest mmHg.  It is preferred that the same ar m be used throughout the study .  The same 
blood pressure cuff, which has been properl y calibrated, should be used to measure blood 
pressure each time.  When the timing of these measurements coincides wi th a blood 
collection, blood pressure , temperature and pulse rate should be obtained first.
Single sitting blood pressure ( BP), pulse rate, and temperature will be measured at times 
specified in the Schedule of Activities .  Additional collection times or changes to collection 
times will be permitted, as necessary  to ensure appropriate collection of safety  data. 
The use of automated devices for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable, although, when 
done manuall y, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least 
30seconds. 
It is preferred that bod y temperature be collected using t ympanic, oral, or axillary  methods 
and that the same method be used consistently  throughout the study .
Vital signs (incl uding blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature) and ECG should be 
performed before laboratory  blood collection and endoscopic procedure.
7.1.10. Medical History, Physical Examination, Height and Weight
Medical history ,including CD history , history  of illegal dr ug, alcohol, tobacco use, skin rash, 
skin infection, and any abnormalities that may predispose the subject to infection will be 
collected at the Screening visit.   Smoking status and average weekl y alcohol consumption 
(units/week) will also be collected.
Complete Phy sical Examination :
A standard ph ysical examination will be performed at the visits identified in Schedule of 
Activities.  The following parameters and bod y systems will minimally  be examined and any  
abnormalities described: General appearance, skin (presence of rash), head, ey es, ears, nose 
and throat (HEENT ), lungs (auscultation), heart (auscultation for presence of murmurs, 
gallops, rubs, peripheral edema), abdomina l (palpation and auscultation), neurologic (mental 
status, station, gait, reflexes, motor and sensory  function, coordination) and, lymph nodes.

An abbreviated ph ysical examination will be performed at the visits identified in Schedule of 
Activities.  The following parameters and bod y systems will minimally  be examined and an y 
abnormalities described : Skin, lungs, heart, abdomen and l ymph nodes.  Additional organ 
systems may  be examined at the investigator decision.  Any clinically  significant changes 
from the baseline examination should be recorded as AEs.  Bod y temperature also will be 
collected at these visits.
Both full and targeted phy sical examinations must include a full body  skin examination.  
Skin examinations should include a visual inspection of the breasts and external genitalia to 
assess for rashes , even if a subject does not w antto have an examination of the breast and/or 
external genitalia (these are optional) done as a part of the ph ysical examination .
Complete and Targeted phy sical exa minations are performed at specified timepoints (See 
Schedule of Activities).
Additional targeted PE may  be performed during the study  at the investigator’s discretion.
Height and weight will be measured without the subject wearing s hoes.  Height (inches or 
centimeters) will be measured and recorded at the Screening visit only  and weight (lbs or kg) 
will be measured and recorded at various timepoints (See 
Schedule of Activities).
Note: Elbow c ircumference will only  be measured for male subjects with height ≤163 cm.

should be taken from adjacent uninflamed ileocolonic mucosa for RNA 
analysis.  All inflamed pre -treatment biopsies should be obtained in a targeted manner 
from the most affected are a.  During post -treatment endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], samples should be 
obtained from inflamed mucosa at approximately the same anatomic location as the 
baseline assessment. If no inflammation is observed, post- treatment biopsies should 
be obtained at approximately  the same anatomic location as the baseline assessment
based on the investigator’s discretion.
Frankl y ulcerated areas should be avoided.   For all biopsies collected, record the colonic 
segment and approximate distance from the anal verge for each sample in the source 
document s.  If 19biopsies cannot be collected during the endoscopy , then samples from 
inflamed tissues should be prioritized in the order of histology , RNA analy sis, protein 
analysis, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_168021]/or cy tometry /microbiome anal ysis. 
Due to the rejection of t
he Import L icense for the Fetal Bovine Serum required for the 
processing of 1 tissue sample for cy tometry , this sample will not be collected for subjects in 
South Africa. Therefore in South Africa, 18 tissue samples will be collected instead of the 
protoc ol defined 19 samples.
Histological, gene expression (RNA), protein analysis and epi[INVESTIGATOR_168021]/or 
cytometry /microbiome analy sis may  be conducted on the biopsy  samples that are obtained.  
[COMPANY_007] and the central laboratory  vendor will provide sites with instructions for collection,

based on diary
 data obtained on 7 consecutive days prior to two (2) days of bowel 
preparation (if applicable), including an y dietary  modification as part of the bowel 
preparation.  For example, subjects should have their SF and AP scores calculated based on 
7-consecutive diary  data prior to two (2) day
s of bowel preparation for colonoscopy .For all 
remaining visits that do not require an endoscop y, the CDAI calculations including SF/AP 
scores will need to be calculated based on the 7 days prior to the stud y visit. For more details

7.2.6. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) for Health Outcomes Assessment
Patient reported outcomes (PRO ) assessments are self -administered during the study . Refer 
to Appendix 12for Alternative Measures During Public Emergencies if applicable.
It is important to note that the PRO measurements are collected and evaluated in a different 
manner than the observed or volunteered adverse events.  Given those differences, no attempt 
will be made to resolve any  apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered adverse 
events and PRO data collected from subjects.  Adverse event incidence rates will not be 
calculated from these solicited data but rather from the information recorded on the AE pages 
on the CRF.
The following PROs will be completed as specified in the Schedule of Activities.  Subjects
should be encouraged to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study  visit 
prior to an y clinical assessments.  A member of the staff should be available if a subject

8.1.Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety  events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; 
(2)non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under 
study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. 
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety Within [ADDRESS_196135] 
under study  during 
pregnancy  or 
breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), 
except occupational 
exposureExposure during pregnancy , 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposur e 
(regardless of whether 
associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safet y on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_196136] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (foll ow-up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information rele vant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196137] SAE
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determi ned b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details On Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF .  It 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medic al 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously
reported b y the stud y subject.  In addition, each study subject will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal Section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. 
When a subject withdraws fr om the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before th e subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_196138] after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being re lated to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator , and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_168087] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the inve stigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196139] or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying diseas e;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objecti ve test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or

and/or
Test result l eads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator o r sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disabil ity/incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whethe r an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.   Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a

Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_43038] y 
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg , for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject;
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.

Page 1438.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes 
of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  by [CONTACT_74096], and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database. 
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign o f liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outc ome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug -induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elev ations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, by [CONTACT_168088], AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (ass essed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196140]’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laborato ry values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 ×ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. 
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_196141] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/ international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for furthe r testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a co formulated product in prescription or over
-the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196142]/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be r eported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR
In the PF-06700841 ( brepocitinib )FIH stud y B7931001 , serum creatinine elevation was 
reported across dose levels in both healthy  volunteers and psoriasis patients.  The proposed 
mechanism for the observed serum creatinine increases in study  B7931001 is inhibition of 
creatinine transport in the kidney  (ie, t ransporter -mediated rather than direct nephrotoxicity ) 
(See Section [IP_ADDRESS].1).
Abnormal values in serum creatinine concurrent with ab sence of increase in blood urea 
nitrogen ( BUN )that meet the below criteria, in the absence of other causes of kidney  injury , 
are considered important medical events. 
All subjects will have serum creatinine based and serum cy statin -C based eGFR calculated at 
times specified in the Schedule of Activities. If an individual subject demonstrates a 
CONCOMITANT serum creatinine based AND serum cystatin C based eGFR decline 
of ≥30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR, then the subject 
should not be further 
dosed and adequate, immediate, supportive measures including immediate evaluation b y a 
nephrologist (preferabl y within 24 hours) with appropriate management.  If the subject 
cannot be seen b y a nephrologist within [ADDRESS_196143] or weekly at a minimum until the eGFR returns to baseline ±15% or the 
renal parameters are deemed to be stable b ythe nephrologist and/or PI.
eGFR results will be communicated to the treating phy sician. 
Subjects should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 24 to 48hours from awareness of the abnormal eGFR ( CONCOMITANT 
serum creatinine based AND serum cy statin C based eGFR decline of ≥30% compared to the 
subject’s baseline eGFR ) result for a safet y follow -up visit.  This evaluation should include 
laboratory  tests, detailed history , and ph ysical assessment.  I n addition to repeating serum 
creatinine and serum cy statin C, laboratory  tests should also include: serum BUN, serum CK, 
serum electrol ytes (including at a minimum potassium, sodium, phosphate/phosphorus, 
calcium), in addition to urine dipstick, urine mic roscopic examination, and urinary  indices.  
All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the above pre- set laboratory  criteria, with no 
other cause(s) of laboratory  abnormalities identified should be considered as important 
medical event irrespective o f availabilit y of all the results of the investigations performed to 
determine etiology  of the abnormal serum creatinine. 

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196144] under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 2 4hours of investigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) t o the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occ urred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrity of the ter minated fetus should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).

Page 147If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_196145].
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the so urce documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated S AE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administer ed in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, duri ng the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  withi n 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a cop y of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.5. Medication Errors 
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administratio n or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. 
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the 
CRF.
Medication errors should be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within [ADDRESS_196147] SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE .
9.DATA A NALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a s tatistical analysis plan(SAP) , which will be 
provided prior to the un -blinding of the trial and maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may 
modify  what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate ; however, an y major modifications 
of the primary  endpoint definition s or their anal yses will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendme nt.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
Using a 2-sample test of proportions and assuming that the true SES-CD 50 rate is 12
% for 
the placebo group and 29% for PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib )at Week 12, a sample size of 
approximately  70completed subjects in PF-0665160 0 (ritlecitinib )arm and [ADDRESS_196148] about 80% probability  to statistically  detect a

PF-06700841 ( brepoci tinib) compared to placebo at the end of stud y with a local type -I error 
5% 1- sided.  This takes into account that the first interim analy sis didn’t stop for early  
efficacy  or futility .Since the probability  for the trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_168022] y efficacy  at first 
interim based on CMEI is 3% when there is no treatment effect, the t ype-Ierror for the 
comparison of each active arm to placebo is controlled at 8%. More details on the past
interim analy ses are described in Section 9.6.
In order to evaluate the primary  endpoint of SES-CD50, we expect that 83 subjects in 
PF-06651600 ( ritlecitinib )arm and 71subjects in combined placebo arm to be randomized 
and dosed into the primary  study  population , assuming a 15% drop out rate. Including 
subjects alread y randomized to the PF-06700841
(brepocitinib )arm prior to amendment 5, a 
total of approximately  [ADDRESS_196150] -baseline measurement (after taking randomized study  
medication) will be included in the efficac y data analyses.
  All the comparisons during the 
induction period will be to placebo.   There will be no comparisons between the two active 
treatment s PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) and PF-06700841 (brepocitinib ).
9.2.1. Analysis of 
the Primary Endpoint During 
Inductio n
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is proportion of subjects achieving SES-CD 50 defined as 
≥50% reduction in SES -CD from baseline change from baseline in SES -CD at Week 12.  The 
SES-CD 50 data comparing active treatment group and placebo group will b e anal yzed using 
the Cochran Mantel Hanzel ( CMH )test, adjusting the stratification factors, ie, status of 
previous treatment of anti TNF therapy .  Treatment differences in the SES-CD 50 response
and the corresponding 2 -sided 90% confidence intervals adju sted for stratification factors 
will be computed using the methods proposed b y Cochran12with the minimum risk weights 
proposed b y Mehrotra and Railkar.11It is anticipated to have small numbers in each 
investigation site, so the investigation site effect will not be anadjust ment factor . 
The observed risk rate and the associated confidence interval of the risk differences will be 
presented.  The unconditional exact method as described by  [CONTACT_24543] (1999)13will be 
used to compute the confidence intervals.   
More details will be documented in the Statistical 
Analy sis Plan.  The primary  anal ysis population will be based on a modified intent -to-treat
(mITT)analy sis set , which is def ined as all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose of randomized treatment.   Treatment failure approach will be used for missing value 
imputation from drop out subjects. Additional sensitivity  analy ses for the primary  endpoint 
will be described in the SAP.

Page 1509.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints During Induction
The binary  secondary  endpoints are p roportion of subjects achieving SES- CD 25
(≥25% reduction from baseline), and CME I (≥
3 points reduction from baseline), endoscopic 
remission (SES -CD ≤ 2) and mucosal healing (complete absence of ulcers) at Week 12.  
These endpoints will be analy zed similar to the primary  efficacy  endpoint using the CMH
test comparing the treatment differences b y adjusting the stratification factor, status of 
previous treatment of anti TNF therapy .  Point estimation of difference and 90% CI  will be 
provided using the 
same methods proposed for the primary  endpoints.  The continuous 
secondary  endpoint for change from baseline in SES -CD at Week 12 will be anal yzed using 
an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )model which will include terms for treatment group, 
the stratification factors (if there are a sufficient number of subjec ts in each stratum, 
otherwise, the stratification factors will be dropped from the model), and the baseline 
SES-CD score.
The anal ysis population will be on the mI TT analy sis set.   The anal yses on continuous 
secondary  endpoints will not account for missing values, ie, it will be based on the Data As
Observed (DAO) approach without explicit imputation to handle the missing data.   
Treatment failure approach will be used for missing value imputation for binary  endpoints
.
9.3.Analysis of Other Endpoints During Indu ction
9.3.1. Pharmacokinetic Analysis
The PK concentration population is defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one 
dose of PF -
06651600 (ritlecitinib) or PF-06700841 (brepocitinib ) and in whom at least one 
concentration value is reported.
PK concentrations will be summarized and presented with summary  statistics.  A population 
PK model may  be developed for the purpose of estimating PK parameters.  Any  population 
PK model developed to characterize the PK data will be reported separately .
9.3.2. PK/PD Unblinding Plan
A PK/PD unblinding plan approved b y the clinical lead, clinical pharmacology  lead and 
statistical lead will be in place to describe the procedures to be employ ed in safeguarding the 
study  blind for members of the study  team.  These procedur
es will be in accordance with 
applicable [COMPANY_007] standard operating procedures (SOPs) for releasing randomization codes 
and breaking the stud y blind.  Under this plan a group of statisticians, PK/PD data provider, 
PK/PD analy st and PK/PD support would be un blinded in order to initiate the building of 
statistical models of the PK, dose/response as well as exposure/response analy sis models and 
conduct associated simulations.  The aim of this work would be to facilitate a fuller 
interpretation of the study  upon completion of the induction period.  This group will not 
serve on the stud y team during the period of earl y unblinding.  The unblinding may  occur 
after the last subject has been randomized to the induction period.  The details of the 
procedures will be de scribed in the PK/PD Unblinding Plan for Modeling and
Simulation for study  B7981007 which will be finalized prior to the start of the PK/PD 
unblinding.

group and placebo group.   The primary  anal ysis population for the health outcomes will be 
based on a mITT anal ysis set.   The anal yses on continuous endpoints will not account for 
missing values, ie, it will be based on the Data asObserved (DAO) approach without explicit 
imputation to handle the missing data.   Treatment failure approach will be used for missing 
value imputation for binary  endpoints from drop out subjects.
9.4.Safety Analysis During Induction
All clinical AEs, SAEs, TEAEs, withdrawal due to AEs, ECGs, vital signs and safet y 
laboratory  data will be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the s tudy to 
evaluate the safet y of subjects.

9.6.
Interim Analysis 
This protocol may  include 2 interim anal yses using CMEI for both active treatments.  Details 
regardi ng the anal ysis procedures to be used for the interim anal ysis will be provided in the 
interim analy sis plan (IAP).  The first interim analy siswill be performed when approximately  
60% of subjects have completed or had the chance to complete the Week 12 visit.  The 
objective of this interim anal ysis is to determine if there is evidence of lack of differentiation 
(“futility ”) or significant efficacy  for the active treatments compared to placebo.  The 
non-binding futility  decision at this interim analy sis isbased on conditional power evaluated 
on a total of approximately  150 subjects who complete or had the chance to complete 
Week 12.  
The study  will be stopped for futility  for that active treatment arm if conditional probability  
of claiming efficacy  by [CONTACT_168094] <10% for that active arm.  If the non- binding 
futility  condition is met for both active arms, the study  may  be stopped at this 
interim point .  
Efficacy  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_168023] -Shih-DeCani gamma family16of
spending function, with parameter 0, at each interim. The study  may  
be stopped for eff icacy ,
if efficacy  condition is met by  [CONTACT_168095]. 
Second interim anal ysis may  be performed when approximately  80% of the subjects have 
completed or had the chance to complete the Week [ADDRESS_196154] of individuals will be provided 
in the interim analy sis plan/charter.  The results of the interim anal yses will not enable 
individuals directly  involved in running the stud y (such as investigators) to identify  treatment 
assignments for individual subjects still in the study . 
During theseinterim analy ses, some members of the stu dy team may  be unblinded and 
replaced with blinded colleagues.   The subjects, investigators, and individuals from the 
sponsor (or designee) who interact with the investigators and monitor safet y will co ntinue to 
be blinded to individual study treatments th roughout the follow up period of the study .
9.7.Data Monitoring Committee 
This study  will use an external data monitoring committee (E
-DMC ). 
The E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the
safet y of subjects in the study 
according to the charter.  The E-DMC will review accumulating renal safety  data and 
propose changes to the protocol as needed to ensure subject safety .  The recommendations 
made b y the E -DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to [COMPANY_007] for final 
decision.  [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate 
analyses of endpoint events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, to regulatory 
authorities, as appropriate.   Additional inf ormation can be obtained in the E -DMC charter.
An internal r eview committee (I RC) will be formed to assess the interim anal yses as 
described in Section 9.6. Details on the I RC will be included in the interim analysis charter.
9.8.Safety Adjudication Committees
Suspected opportunistic infections , neuroaudiometry andcardiovascular events (eg ,
thrombotic and embolic events) will be subject to review by [CONTACT_168096]. These 
events will be forwarded for adjudication either b y the study  team or by  [CONTACT_168097]. Event 
documents may  be requested from sites and may  include (but not be limited to): hospit al 
discharge summarie s, operative reports, clinic notes, diagnostic tests, pathology  reports, 
autopsy  reports and death certificate information, as applicable. Obtaining and submit ting 
this documentation will be the responsibility  of the study  site. Additional events of interest 
may be adjudicated by [CONTACT_168098].
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monit oring visits during stud y conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will al low [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196155] and/or after study completion, the investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the IRB/EC, and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
The investigator(s) will not ify [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject's medical records.  The investigator will promptl y provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process .
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electron ic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].   The investigator shall ensure that the 
CRFs are securel y stored at the study  site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will 
be password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access b y unauthorized third 
parties.
The invest igator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring ,and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs aretrue. Any correcti ons to ent ries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these 
cases ,
data collecte d on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 

PF-06651600, PF -[ADDRESS_196156] Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,
letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines , according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the c linical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer. The 
investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so long as they are 
retained.
If the investigator becomes unable for any  reason to continue to retain study  records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_196157] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study

the COVID -19 pandemic globall y and will become effective for other public eme rgencies 
only upon written notification from [COMPANY_007]. 
Use of these alternative study  measures are expected to cease upon the return of business as

Not Applicable.
Appendix 12.2. TeleHealth Visits
In the event that in -clinic study  visits cannot be conducted, every  effort should be made to 
follow up on the safet y of study participants at scheduled visits per the Schedule of Activities
or unscheduled visits. 
Telehealth visits may  be used to continue to assess participant safety  and collect data points, 
(if permitted b y law or local guidance). Telehealth includes the exchange of healthcare 
informatio n and services via telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, 
video- conferencing software) remotel y, allowing the participant and the investigator to 
communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, reminders, education, and 
safet ymonitoring. The following assessments must be performed during a telehealth visit .
Review and record stud y intervention(s), including compliance and missed doses.
Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8
. 
Review and record an y new concomitant medications or changes in concomitant
medications since the last contact.
Review and record contraceptive method and results of pregnancy  testing (as 
available ). Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) 
required in the protocol. Refer to Section 4.4.1 and Section 7.1.4.

Page 200In situations where participants are unable to attend sites f or protocol requ ired 
pregnancy  testing, the participant should ,if possible ,visit a local labor atory for 
pregnancy  testing (whereallowable by [CONTACT_168103] ).If this is not 
possible, the study  site should make every  effort to develop a plan to provide a 
home urine pregn ancy testing kit with a sensitivity of at least 25 IU/mL to be 
performed b y the participant at home. The site should document the pregnancy  
test outcome in a source document and enter the result into the study  database 
and/or CRF as required.
Study  participants must be reminded to promptl y notify  site staff about an y change in their 
health status. 
Appendix 12.3. Alternative Facilities for Safety Assessments
Appendix 12.3.1. Laboratory Testing
If a stud y participant is unable to visit the site for protocol -specified safety  laboratory  
evaluations, testing may  be conducted at a local laboratory  if permitted by  [CONTACT_427]. 
Thelocal laboratory  may be a standalone institution or within a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The following 
safet y laboratory  evaluations may  be performed at a local laboratory : See SoA.
If a local laboratory  is used, qualified study  site personnel must order, receive, and review 
results. Site staff must collect the local laboratory  reference ranges and 
certifications/accreditations for filing at the site. Laboratory  test results are to be provided to 
the site staff as soon as possible.  The local labor atory  reports should be  filed in the 
participant’s source documents/medical records. Relevant data from the local laboratory  
report should be  recorded on the CRF.
If a participant requiring pregnancy  testing cannot visit a local laboratory  for pregnancy  
testing, a home urine pregnancy  testing kit with a sensitivity  of at least 25 IU/mL  may  be 
used by  [CONTACT_22860], if compliant with local regulatory  
requirements. The pregnancy  test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source 
documents/medical records and relevant data recorded on the CRF. Confirm that the

participant also to go to a similar setting in which the study  participant’s safety , 
privacy and ability  to complete the assessment and provide accurate data without 
interruptio n or third party input or influence is adequate;
Read the full text including all instructions, questions, and response choices 
verbatim and mark the response choice selected by [CONTACT_2299]; site staff can 
read the PCOA from the paper source or provisi oned site -based device, but the 
site staff must read exactly  as that specific PCOA appears on the paper source or 
site provisioned device;
Speak clearly  and at a comfortable pace;
Let the stud y participant know that the instructions, question, or response options 
can be re -read at any  time if needed;
Not interpret an y part of the questionnaire for the study  participant. If the study

or feeling?” ;
Confirm the study  participant’s response selection before you record the answer 
(eg,you would like me t o select “moderate pain,” is that right?;
Indicate that the PCOA was administered via telehealth ;
For the telehealth administration of a paper PCOA, indicate this on the participant 
worksheet (ie, the participant facing source document). Include the name [CONTACT_168106] ;
For PCOAs that are collected via telehealth, the PCOA CRF must be completed. 
Document the administration and completion date in the CRF.

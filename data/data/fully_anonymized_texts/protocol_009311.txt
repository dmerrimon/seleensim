 14 1 INTRODUCTION: BACKGR OUND INFORMATION AND  SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
 
1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common baseline comorbidity and the commonest arrhythmia in patients with aortic 
stenosis (AS) undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). AF is a known risk factor for stroke during 
or aft er TAVR, associated with  stroke, bleeding complications, worse outcomes and increased mortality1. The TAVR 
population is at increased long -term bleeding risk, with cognitive impairment, high risk of falls, history of 
spontaneous bleeding, etc. Standard medical therapy for emboli prev ention in AF, long term oral anticoagulation 
(OAC),  carries risk of hemorrhagic stroke, as well as major bleeding complications2. Anti -platelets prescribed after 
TAVR, combined with OAC, worsen bleeding risk further3. Left atrial appendage closure is an alternative to OAC, 
which obviates the need for regular medication and frequent monitoring. The WATCHM AN Left Atrial Appendage 
Closure (LAAC) System is the only device that has been approved by [CONTACT_87467] -embolic events 
in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF)4. Non -valvular AF is defined as atrial fibrillation in the absence of 
rheumatic mitral valvular heart disease5. The WATCHMAN de vice has shown improved safety compared to OAC, 
with reduced event rates for hemorrhagic stroke an d major bleeding in patients receiving the implant6,7. There are 
only small reports of feasibility of the procedure8. Randomized trials with the WATCHMAN device have excluded 
patients with valvular heart disease. As a result, data on safety and efficacy  of the device in TAVR patients with AF is 
lacking9.

1.3 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
1.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
Potential surgical risks associated with the WATCHMAN implant procedure are similar to those encountered peri - 
and postoperatively for many routine catheterization procedures . 
In addition to the general surgical risks, additional risks specifically associated with the WATCHMAN implant are as 
follows:   
WATCH -TAVR Clinical Study  
Protocol V4.4  
July 9 2020   
 15  Additional surgery if the device is not placed in the correct position  
 Allergic reaction to the implant materials  
 Device misplacement  
 Device embolization  
 Device fracture or extrusion  
 Excessive bleeding    
 Hypertrophic scarring or thrombosed veins  
 Inability to move or retrieve device   
Patients who receive the WATCHMAN implant should stop warfarin  therapy at the 45 -day follow -up visit; therefore, 
at that time, patients may be at an increased risk of stroke. Warfarin  is the proven standard of care for r educing the 
risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation.   
Risks associated with long term warfarin  therapy are:  
 Fatal or nonfatal hemorrhage from any tissue or organ  
 Bleeding which occurs when PT/INR is within the therapeutic range warrants diagnostic investig ation since 
it may unmask a previously unsuspected lesion, e.g., tumor, ulcer, etc.  
 Necrosis of skin and other tissues.  
 See ADVERSE REACTIONS section of warfarin  tablets  package insert . 
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_95334] excluded any patient with an Aortic Valve Area < 1.[ADDRESS_95335] high frailty scores, increasing risks of bleeding further. Device based thrombo -
embolism preventio n will avoid these increased bleeding risks and possibly improve quality of life. It will also obviate 
the need for regular medication, decrease drug -drug interactions in a population already on multiple medications, 
and reduce the need for regular monitor ing of INR levels.

2 OBJECTIVES  AND  PURPOSE  
The WATCH -TAVR study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of left atrial appendage occlusion with 
the WATCHMAN device in the prevention of stroke and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).  
The efficacy of the WATCHMAN device has been previously demonstrated in patients with non -valvular AF who are 
eligible for warfarin  therapy. Until now , trials with the WATCHMAN device h ave excluded patients with aortic 
stenosis (AVA <1.0cm2). There is no conclusive evidence of the benefit of the device in patients with severe AS. A 
large portion of patients with severe AS who undergo TAVR are known to have AF. This increases stroke risk 
dramatically after the procedure and is associated with worse outcomes. Standard medical therapy, i.e. 
anticoagulation is associated with increased risks of bleeding, including major bleeds and intra -cranial hemorrhage. 
There is a lack of clear consensus g uidelines regarding the use of anticoagulation in AF after TAVR. In addition, many 
patients are unsuitable candidates for long term anticoagulation and need an alternative approach to stroke 
prevention. This study aims to establish the efficacy and safety of the WATCHMAN device in preventing stroke and 
bleeding in patients with AF undergoing TAVR.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN AND ENDPOINTS  
 
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY DESIGN  
The WATCH -TAVR study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to be conducted at approxi mately  33 centers

patients must be evaluated for adverse events using an assessment of history and physical exam .  NIHSS Stroke 
Assessme nt Worksheet and MRS Stroke Assessment Worksheet should be completed at each visit.  
For patients who suffer a stroke or TIA following randomization, the following assessments should be completed:  
 Complete evaluat ion by [CONTACT_87471], AND  
 Brain Imaging (CR/MR I) 
Patients who received a WATCHMAN implant are required to undergo a TEE examination during the procedure and 
45-days post -implant.  TEE imaging must be performed in accordance with standard protocol , using color Doppler 
technology and possibly ECHO contra st within the LAA to confirm the absence of blood flow AROUND and/or 
THROUGH the  WATCHMAN implant.  Patients randomized to WATCHMAN who have intracardiac thrombus 
visualized during the procedure are contraindicated from receiving the device per labeling gui delines, but will remain 
in the trial as intent to treat and should be followed for all study visits.  
 Completion of the following assessments must be documented on the Follow -Up Case Report Form:  
 The presence or lack of flow in the LAA;  
 Residual atrial se ptal shunt;  
 Thrombus on the device surface;  
 Device position  
Patients randomized to the TAVR alone group are to remain on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy  at the discretion 
of the treating physician  indefinitely  if possible . If the patient i s on warfarin, d osage should be adjusted such that 
patients maintain a therapeutic INR of 2.0 – 3.0. According to ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines on Management of Patients 
with Atrial Fibrillation, INR is to be monitored per site standard of care guidelines while  patients are on warfarin 
therapy.  
All patients should continue to undergo routine post -TAVR follow -up as per accepted standard s of care.

7.[ADDRESS_95345] event that affects the patient’s health or safety. When reporting an adverse event, 
the investigator will complete the AE report form.  
Adverse experiences that require reporting include any adverse event with clinical sympt oms that could possibly be 
contributed to any of the following:  
• The WATCHMAN device  
• The TAVR device  
• The WATCHMAN implant procedure (including pericardial effusion, device embolism, stroke)  
• The TAVR implant procedure (including pericardial effusion, devic e embolism, stroke)  
• Any study required procedures (i.e., clinical complications from protocol required TEE , etc.)  
The following adverse events will also be reported regardless of relationship to the device(s) or procedure(s):  
• Any event with an outcome of  death  
• Stroke (ischemic and/or hemorrhagic) and TIA  
• Any events associated with bleeding  
• Arterial or venous thrombosis or  embolism  
• Rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_87461]  
• Any potential Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (see definiti on below)  
Each adverse event will be evaluated by [CONTACT_87475].  
i) Relatedness  
The relatedness of an adverse event to the study, WATCHMAN Device, TAVR device, WATCHMAN procedures or 
TAVR procedure will be assessed by [CONTACT_87476].  
• Device Related : An adverse event that results from the presence or performance of the device or any other 
component of the system.  
WATCH -TAVR Clinical Study  
Protocol V4.4  
July 9 2020   
 27 • Procedure Related : An adverse event that occurs due to the system i mplantation procedure. Adverse 
events that are contributable to the anesthesia or contrast media given during the implant procedure will 
be considered procedure related.  
• Unknown : An adverse event that cannot be determined to have a causal relationship with either the system 
or procedure will be classified as unknown.  
• Not Related : An adverse event that is determined to not have a causal relationship with either the system 
or proc edure.  
ii) Seriousness  
Adverse events as described above will b e evaluated for serious injury.  Adverse events resulting in death or serious 
injury are to be reported to the sponsor  within 24 hours of learning of the event. Serious injury is an injury or illness 
that:  
• Is life -threatening, or  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or  
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or 
permanent damage to a body structure. Permanent means irreversible impairment or damage to a body 
structure or function, excluding trivial impairment or damage [21 CFR 803.3]  
 Note: Not all cosmetic damage is considered trivial.  Furthermore, a life -threatening injury meets the  definition of 
serious injury, regardless of whether the threat was “temporary.”  It should also be noted that a device does not 
have to malfunction for it to cause or contribute to a serious injury. Even though a device may function properly, it 
can still  cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Caused or contributed  to means that a death or serious 
injury was or may have been attributed to a medical device or that a medical device was or may have been a factor 
in a death or serious injury, includ ing events occurring as a result of [21 CFR 803.3]: 1. Failure; 2. Malfunction; 3. 
Improper or inadequate design; 4. Manufacture; 5. Labeling; or 6. User error  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
Per 21 CFR 812.3(s) “an unanticipated adverse device  effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or 
any life -threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_1282], a device, if that effect, problem, or death was 
not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the  investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of patients.”

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
9.1 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
All statistical analysis will be “intent -to-treat”, with each patient being considered as part of their  randomized  group 
irrespective of the actual treatment received. Patients not having an event, or lost to follow -up will be censored at 
the time of their last documented follow -up visit  or phone call.  
The study is designed to demonstrate the non -inferiority of the WA TCHMAN device compared to the control group, 
with regards to the primary endpoint (composite of all-cause mortality, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic),  or 
bleeding  (major and/or life -threatening)).  Non -inferiority will be assessed using the 1 -sided 97.5% c onfidence 
interval around the hazard ratio  (WATCHMAN -TAVR : TAVR only ).  Non -inferiority will be demonstrated if the 1 -sided 
97.5% upper confidence limit for the difference in proportions is less than 1.5. If the non -inferiority objective  is met, 
additional analyses to assess superiority of the WATCHMAN group to the control group will be performed. The 
composite primary endpoint will also be summarized as events per [ADDRESS_95346] deviation (SD), median, interquartile 
range (Q1, Q3) and range (minimum and maximum). General linear models will be used t o compare continuous 
variables across treatment groups. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentage of subjects  
and compared using the standard Chi -square statistic or  Fisher’s Exact test , as appropriate.  
In general, missing data w ill not be imputed and will remain missing, unless otherwise indicated.  
 
 
9.2 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
The study is designed to demonstrate the non -inferiority of the WATCHMAN device compared to the control group, 
with regards to the primary endpoint ( compos ite of all-cause mortality, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), bleeding  
(major and/or life -threatening) ).  
The following null hypothes es will be tested:  
 H01:  The hazard ratio for WATCHMAN + TAVR relative to TAVR is ≥1.5 (non -inferiority)  
 H02:  The hazard ratio for WATCHMAN + TAVR relative to TAVR is ≥1.0 (superiority)  
If H 01 is rejected, then H 02 will also be tested.  If the null hypothesis for non -inferiority is not rejected, H 02 will not be 
tested.

9.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
Intention -to-Treat Population (ITT):  The primary analysis will be based on the ITT population.  All randomized 
subjects will be analyzed according to their original randomization assignment (WATCHMAN+TAVR or TAVR)  
regard less of treatment received.  
Per-protocol populat ion: The per -protocol population is defined as patients in the WATCHMAN group s who received 
both the WATCHMAN and the prosthetic valv e. In the TAVR only group, it is defined as pati ents who had the 
prosthetic valve placed.

rates, hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals and a p -value associated with the non -inferiorit y hypothesis will be 
provided. If the non -inferiority objective is met, a p -value for the superiority hy pothesis will also be provided.  
Secondary endpoints  will be summarized using event rates, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals.  Nominal p -
values for comparisons between treatment groups will be provided for descriptive purposes only.  
All patients should be followed until the termination of the study, regardless of adherence to the treatment strategy.  
Available information on patients lost to follow -up will be included in the analyses.  Patients not reaching a primary 
endpoint by [CONTACT_87477].

within one year following randomization. Estimates  of the hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals will be based 
on the Cox proportional hazards model, under the assumption of proportional hazards.  Comparison of cumulat ive 
hazard functions will be based on the log -rank test.  
The upper bound of the confidence interval will be generated from the Cox proportional hazards model with 
treatment  group as a facto r.

9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECO NDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Secondary endpoin ts will include the following:  
 Time from randomization to each component of the primary endpoint:  
o All-cause mortality  
o Any stroke  
o Any occurrence of major or life -threatening bleeding  (as per VARC2 definition of bleeding)  
 
 Time to death from cardiovascular causes  
 Time to ischemic stroke  
 Time to hemorrhagic stroke  
 Arterial or venous thrombosis or  embolism  
 Rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_87462].  
 Procedural costs related to the initial TAVR procedure and WATCHMAN device implantation.  
Analysis of time -to-event endpoints for the components will be analyzed similarly to that of the primary endpoint, 
except there will be no testing of t he non -inferiority hypothesis. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will 
be derived from a Cox p roportional model with treatment group as a factor. Descriptive frequencies of the endpoints 
and Kaplan -Meier curves will be presented. P-values may be provided for descriptive purposes, but should not be 
considered informative.  The frequency of procedure related complications, device/implant failure or systemic 
embolism will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Costs  directly related to the  initial TAVR procedure and WATCHMAN  device implantation will be collected .  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_95349] the WATCHMAN 
implantation procedure performed simultaneously with  TAVR. The primary endpoint is a composite of a ll-cause 
mortality, stroke, life -threatening or major bleeding. The objective of the study is to demonstrate non -inferiority of 
the TAVR plus WATCHMAN  device compared to the TAVR only group.  
Data from the PARTNER1 trial, along with the SOURCE -XT10 and FRANCE -211 registries show all -cause mortality rates 
in TAVR patients with AF vary  from 19 -30%, stroke rates from 6 -10% and major/life -threatening bleeding from 17 -
22% . The PROTECT -AF trial for the WATCHMAN d evice  in non -valvular atrial fibrillation patients  reported a risk 
reduction of nearly 40% for the primary composite endpoint of stroke, systemic embolization or cardiovascul ar or 
unexplained death (RR 0.61 , 95%C rI 0.4 2-1.07)4. 
WATCH -TAVR Clinical Study  
Protocol V4.4  
July 9 2020   
 31 The following assumptions were used to  determine the sample size needed to assess the non -inferiority hypothesis 
for the composite primary endpoint of all -cause mortality, stroke or major or life -threatening bleeding:  
o One-sided α =0.025  
o Primary event rate in the control population (TAVR only) of 35% at one year  
o Non -inferiority margin of 1.[ADDRESS_95350] 80%  
o Lost to follow -up rate 10%  
 
Assuming level of significance ( α) to be 0.05 (or α =0.025 one -sided) and aiming for a study power (1 -β) of 80%, we 
estimate  191 primary events will be needed to rule out an upper limit of the one -sided 97.5% confidence interval of 
1.5.  Assuming an enrollment  duration of 18 months, follow -up period of 24 months, and 10% drop out rate per 
annum, the minimum total sample size required is 350  (175per group) .

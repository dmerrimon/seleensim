Stemnion, Inc. 
Name [CONTACT_791]:  
ST266 [ Amnion- derived Cellular Cytokine Solution (ACCS)]  
Name [CONTACT_3261]:  
ST266 (ACCS) is a novel secretome d erived from proprietary cells. ST266 is composed of a complex 
mixture of cytokines, growth factors, nucleic acids , and undefined cellular components produced by 
[CONTACT_176996]- derived multi -potent p rogenitor (AMP) Cells in Iscove’s Modi fied Dulbecco’s 
Medium (IMDM). It contains at least 75 cytokines and growth factors in physiological concentrations 
and 2 proteins  (0.5% human serum albumin and epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] ) that are added to support the 
growth of the cells.  
Title of Study:  
A randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study to evaluate the safety, efficacy , and treatment 
regimen of ST266 in subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis.  
Study C enter(s):  Multi -center (approximately 5 to 7 clinical sites in the [LOCATION_002] ) 
Phase of D evelopment: Phase 2 a 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
To determine the efficacy of ST266 to reduce pocket depth ( PD) adj unctive to scaling and root pla ning 
(SRP) . 
Secondary:  
To determine safety and changes in:  
• Clinical attachment l evel (CAL)  
• Bleeding on probing (BOP)  
Study Design:  
The study is a 9- month, ran domized, double -blind, parallel -design study of subjects with existing 
moderate to severe periodontal disease randomly assigned to one of three groups. The primary endpoint 
of PD  change will be evaluated following 9 months of treatment. Subjects will be fo llowed for 
9 months for safety and radiographic evaluations.  
Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of three treatment groups. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_176997] (never smoked or quit smoking more than 
two ye ars ago vs. has smoked within the last two years ). Randomization will be  blocked such that 
assignment to treatment groups both within sites and within smoker status will be approximately even 
(1:1:1). Treatment will be initiated after SRP.  
All subjects will be evaluated at baseline and Days 1, 15, 30, 60, 90, 180 , and 270. 
Number of S ubjects  (Planned): A total of [ADDRESS_207162]:  Each subject will be enrolled in the study  for 9 months.

    Investigational produc t, dosage and mode of administration: 1 X ST266 applied in a dose of 
20 microliters per tooth. Total daily dose will be less than 1 milliliter. ST266 will be applied directly to 
the marginal gingiva around each tooth (buccal and lingual) using sterile packaged pi[INVESTIGATOR_176974] M4 device.  
Duration of T reatment:  
Group 1: ST266 dosed daily on Days 1 -5, 8-12, 22, and 30, and then monthly for 7 months (Days 60, 
90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240).  
Group 2: ST266 dosed 2x/ week (with at least one day  between t reatment s) for the first 3 months and 
monthly for 5 months thereafter  (Days 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240).  
Group 3: Placebo dosed at the same frequency as Group 1.  
Placebo , Dosage, and Mode of A dministration: Sterile saline (0.9%  NaCl ) will be applied in the 
same manner and in the same volume as the investigational product, ST266.  
Criteria for E valuation:  
Efficacy:  The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is t he average change in each patient between the 
PD at baseline and the PD at 9 months (Day  270)  for those pockets  ≥6 mm at baseline.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints of this study are: (1) change from baseline in CAL at 9 months  (Day 
270); (2) change from baseline in BOP at 9 months  (Day 270) ; and (3) change from  baseline in PD at 9 
months (Day 270) using all tooth- sites.  
Exploratory endpoints of this study are: (1) Pro -inflammatory mediators, enzymes , and bone markers 
will be measured in gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) and serum  at the baseline, D ays 15, 90, 180, and 
270; (2) microbial analysis of periodontal  flora will be perfor med at baseline and at Days 15, 90, 180, 
and 270 ; and (3 ) change  from baseline in radiographic bone levels ( RBL ) at Days 90 and 270;  (4) 
FMPI [INVESTIGATOR_176975] s 90, 180 and 270; and (5)  change from baseline in PD, CAL  and BOP  will be 
analyzed on Days 90 and 180. 
Safety:  The safety endpoints are frequency and pattern of adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ). 
Planned Sample Size:  The sample size for the study is based on the sample size requi red to reject the 
null hypothesi s for the primary efficacy endpoint . 
The number of subjects was estimated based on 2 meta -analysis studies that reviewed 50 and 
72 articles respectively  (Bonito, 2005 ) to reach a significant difference in PD  reduction at 9 months 
compared with  placebo.  
Using the normal approximation for sample size determination for 2 independent samples, t -tests, and 
assuming a PD reduction of 0.5 mm on average (difference in means) wi th a standard deviation of 
0.7 mm, alpha=0.05 (0.025 per comparison) , and 85 % power, a sample size of 44  per group will be 
required. The expected dropout  rate is 20 % based on previous experiments; hence 50 subjects will be 
enrolled per group.  G eneralized estimating equations ( GEE ) analyses will be performed and therefore, 
the actual power will be between 85 and 90%.  
Statistical methods:  Analysis of the clinical efficacy data will consist of modeling endpoints, 
including change from baseline in PD, CAL, BOP, and FM PI, with treatment group  as a main effect 
and adjusting for baseline  values of a given endpoint . Post -baseline treatment comparisons will be 
modeled through a GEE method (with a linear link and exchangeable covariance matrix), adjusting  for 
the baseline value. Methods of analysis for periodontal flora, inflammatory cytokine levels in GCF and 
in serum, and RBL will be described in separate statistical analysis plans. Results will be considered 
significant if p<0.05.

Amendment #3   
  Version: [ADDRESS_207173] been used with limited long -term success. Antibio tic therapy may 
provide a short -term benefit without a long -term solution. ST266 offers a novel alternative 
mechanism for treatment of periodontal disease.  
5.1. Trial Rationale  
Resolution of inflammati on may reduce injury, promote healing, and return tissue homeostasis. 
Rapid elimination of the invading leukocytes from a lesion is the desired outcome following an inflammatory event. This task becomes more formidable when the acute inflammatory response progresses to chronic inflammation with destruction of the cellular matrix, scarring, and fibrosis. 
Thus, an essential goal for intervention in inflammatory disease is the return of tissue 
homeostasis  (Serhan, 2011) . Interventions in the management of peri odontitis such as root 
planing offer some benefit in removing etiologic agents associated with inflammation and thereby [CONTACT_176998]; however, such procedures do not resolve 
the inflammation and restore tissue homeostasis. Without restoration of tissue homeostasis, inflammatory cells having pro -inflammatory products, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), persist 
causing swelling, irritation, pain, collagen destruction, and ultimately bone resorption ( Kantarci, 
2006).  Agents that stimulate the resolution of inflammation may offer some therapeutic 
advantage in the treatment of periodontitis compared with more traditional pharmacologic 
interventions. 
5.2. Experience with ST266  
ST266, in some ways, may be ideally suited for treating periodontitis. ST266 has been shown in 
in vitro  experiments to reduce the amount of inflammatory cytokines, spec ifically PGE2 . In 
in vivo  experimental model s of periodontitis in rabbits, employed to evaluate the effect of ST266 
on periodontal disease, there was a marked reduction in the inflammation with the use of ST266. Furthermore, there was restoration of lost bone with histological evidence of resolution of the 
inflammatory infiltrates.  
In a phase 1 study of gingivitis, a related disease, 54 subjects (18 per  arm) were treated . Subjects 
had a modified gingival index score of 2.0 or greater and >40% bleeding sites at initial presentation. Three (3) cohorts were tested: Two (2) different ST266 concentrations (1X and 
0.3X ST266) were compared with  the saline placebo control cohort. Subjects received daily 
20 µL topi[INVESTIGATOR_176977] 10 days administered over 2 weeks  (560 μL maximum 
dose) . A follow -up visit was conducted at Day 42 for clinical measurements and safety analysis.  
Protocol ST266- PERIO -201 [Stemnion, Inc. BB-IND# 15,825]  
Amendment #3   
  Version: 08 September 2017

    Efficacy results of the p hase 1 study are summarized in  Table 2. Statistically significant changes 
in clinical attachment level (CAL) and pocket  depth (PD) were observed relativ e to placebo for 
both the 0.3X and 1X ST266 treatment groups at Day 42 (p <0.05). Furthermore, 
pro-inflammatory cytokine biomarkers, interleukin ( IL)-1ß and IL -6, were significantly 
decreased in both the 0.3X and 1X ST266 treatment groups r elative to place bo at Day 12 
(p <0.05). These findings suggest that ST266 has a beneficial effect in subjects with gingivitis 
and supports prior studies demonstrating anti -inflammatory properties of ST266 mediated via 
modulation of pro- inflammatory cytokines.  
Table  2: ST-04-13 Efficacy Outcomes  
 
No significant safety issues were identified in the  phase 1 study. Safety parameters were 
compared for both ST266 treatment groups (1X and 0.3X) relative to placebo using appropriate 
statistical methods. This included adverse events  (AEs) , vital signs, and oral cavity examination 
results. One serious adverse event ( SAE; assault -fractured cheek bone, laceration) occurred 
during this study that was clearly not related to  the study protocol or st udy product. There were 
125 AEs /oral cavity exam findings reported during the entire study, all of which were 
categorized as mild. Out of 125 events, 3 (2.5%) were categorized as related, 5 (4%) were 
categorized as possibly related , and 5 (4 %) were categorized as unlikely re lated. All related and 
possibly related events were reported by [CONTACT_176999], both of wh om were assigned to 
placebo. These results suggest that ST266 was  safe and was well tolerated by [CONTACT_177000] n administered at the 0.3X and 1X concentrations for at least 10 days of treatment.  
Periodontitis with severe bony destruction remains the primary cause of tooth loss. ST266 has been shown to be profoundly anti -inflammatory in both in vitro  and in vivo  preclinical 
experiments including an accepted rabbit model of periodontitis. These findings, coupled with 
the excellent safety profile for ST266 in both animal testing and a phase 1 clinical trial as well as 
use of ST266 in topi[INVESTIGATOR_176978] 90 subjects, support the 
proposed clinical investigation of ST266 in the treatment of periodontal disease.

in CAL at 9 months  (Day 270)  with baseline PD ≥ 6mm; (2) change from baseline in BOP at 9 
months  (Day 270) using whole -mouth average, and (3) change from baseline in PD at 9 months 
(Day 270) using all tooth -sites.  
Baseline refers to the initial measurement of the endpoint, which may occur at the screening or baseline visit according to the schedule of assessments.  
Safety Endpoints: The safety endpoints are frequency and pattern of AE s and SAEs. 
Exploratory Endpoints: Pro -inflammatory mediators, enzymes, and bone markers  will be 
measured in GCF and serum  at baseline and on Days 15, 90, 180, and 270. Microbial analysis of 
periodontal  flora will be performed at baseline and on Days 15, 90, 180, and 270.  C hange from 
baseline in RBL will be measured at Days 90 and 270. All x -rays for RBL will be read at a 
central location using predefined criteria.  PD, CAL and BOP will also be analyzed at Days 90 
and 180. FMPI [INVESTIGATOR_176980] 90, 180 and 270. 
7.2. Number of Subjects  
One hundred and fifty (1 50) subjects will be enrolled. The sample size for the study is based on 
the sample size requir ed to reject the null hypothesis  for the primary efficacy endpoint  which 
contains two comparison s. Using the normal approximation for sample size determination for 
two independent samples, t -tests, and assuming a PD reduction of 0.5 mm on average (difference 
in means) with a standard deviation of 0.7 mm, alpha=0.05 ( Bonferroni corrected, alpha 0.025 
per comparison), and 85% power, a sample size of 44 per group will be required. The expected 
dropout rate is 20% based on previous experiments  and current enrollment trends  hence 50 
subjects will be enrolled per group.  GEE analyses will be performed and t herefore, the actual 
power will be between 85 and 90%.   
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Group 1: ST266 dosed daily on Days 1- 5, 8-12, 22, and 30 and then monthly for 7 months  
(Days  60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240).  
Group 2: ST266 dosed 2x/week (with at least one  day between treatment s) for the first 3 months 
and monthly for 5 months thereafter  (Days 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240).  
Group 3: Placebo dosed at the same frequency as Group 1.  
7.4. Rescue Therapy  
If at Day [ADDRESS_207176] experiences progression  of perio dontitis in any tooth , rescue 
therapy will be p rovided. Progression of periodontitis is defined as an increase of 2 mm or more 
in PD  or CAL  from the baseline measurement  (Goodson, 1982) . Rescue therapy will consist of

Amendment #3   
  Version: [ADDRESS_207177] of care therapy.  
Subjects that receive rescue therapy will continue to participate in all remaining study visits 
through study completion. 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Safety assessments will be performed throughout the course of the study. Any potential safety 
issues that arise will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor’s Medical Monitor in consultation with the 
study investigators to identify the appropriate course of actio n. If the sponsor elects to terminate 
the study for any reason, the investigator will be responsible for notification of the institutional review board ( IRB) and will withhold further treatment of study participants.

fails to return for visits, the investigator should determine the primary reason for a subject’s 
premature withdrawal from the study and record the reason in the subject’s study records.  
All subjects prematurely discontinuing from the trial, regardless of cause, should be scheduled as soon as possible for a follow -up safety visi t, which will include all assessments planned for 
Day 270 ( end of study).  
For subjects who are lost to follow -up (i.e., those subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the i nvestigator should 
document all steps taken to contact [CONTACT_423], e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, 
etc. 
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study after beginning treatment will not be replaced.

Use of concomitant treatment must be recorded in t he subject’s medical record and the electronic 
case report form ( eCRF ), including treatment/drug name, dose, indication, and start/stop dates . In 
addition, no homeopathic remedies  (such as treatment with coconut oil) may be used during the 
study.  
9.3. Treatment  Compliance  
Every treatment application of study drug will be performed in the dental clinic by [CONTACT_984]/investigator  (dental professional) ; therefore, non- compliance can be assessed easily by 
[CONTACT_093].  
Treatments that are missed may be completed if done within the number of days indicated in Table 5 from the original scheduled date.

    9.4. Randomization and Blinding  
A randomization scheme will be generated via interactive web response system ( IWRS ). 
Subjects will be ra ndomize d at the site  after  SRP  is complete . Randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_176997] (never smoked or quit smoking more than two years ago vs. has 
smoked within the last two years ). Randomization will be blocked such that assignment to 
treatment groups both w ithin sites and within smoker status will be approximately even (1:1:1). 
Any subjects that are discontinued after randomization and prior to treatment may be replaced. Examiners will be blinded to the treatment assignment.  
A list of all subjects who have been treated will be maintained at the trial site , including each 
subject’s identity, date of enrollment , and corresponding subject ID , so that any subject may be 
identified if required for any reason. The list is kept by [CONTACT_177003] . The electronic data collection system (EDC) will assign a screening ID number 
when a subject’s data is entered at the screening visit. The subject will be identified only by [CONTACT_177004]/she is either randomized or withdrawn from the study. Upon randomization, the subject’s screening ID number will be converted to a randomization ID number. Subjects will be 
identified only  by [CONTACT_177005]. 
Treatment assignments will be blinded to the  examiner, treatment administrator, and the subjects . 
Only in case of medical emergency or occurrence of AEs  that warrant unblindi ng in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_176983], will the treatment assignment be unblinded and made available to the 
investigator and the Medical Monitor. In the event of study unblinding, a non- study statistician 
will be assigned as the “unblinded statistician”  to assist in unblinding and any safety review.  
If the i nvestigator feels it is necessary to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment after an 
emergency situation, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_177006]. Only after consultation wit h the Medical Monitor will a decision be made as to whether the treatment for 
the subject should be unblinded. The treatment assignment will be revealed on a subject -by-
subject basis, thus leaving the blinding on the remaining subjects intact. 
9.5. Treatment Vi sits 
Treatment visits will consis t of a review of the subject’s medical and dental history, including 
recording concomitant medications. Additionally, the study medication will be applied to the 
buccal and lingual surfaces of the teeth.  Following the appl ication of the study medication an 
assessment of AEs will be performed.  Subjects will be given oral hygiene instructions prior to 
the end of the visit.

    10. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Study Drug  
ST266 (ACCS) is a novel secretome derived from proprieta ry cells. ST266 is composed of a 
complex mixture of cytokines, growth factors, nucleic acids , and undefined cellular c omponents 
produced by [CONTACT_176996]- derived m ulti-potent progenitor (AMP) Cells in Iscove’s Modified 
Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM). It contai ns at least 75 cytokines and growth factors in very low or 
physiological concentrations and 2 proteins ( 0.5% human serum albumin and epi[INVESTIGATOR_47339] ) that are added to support the growth of the cells. 
10.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
ST266 will be  provided to the clinical site in two container  types: frozen in sterile, single -use 
glass vials  and in refrigerated liquid form provided in single -use plastic ampoules . Eppendorf 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_176984]266 will also be provided 
to the site. The dispensing vials and pi[INVESTIGATOR_176985] -use and will not be re -used.  
10.3. Study Drug Storage  
ST266 must be stored per container type.  
• ST266 in single -use glass vials must be stored  frozen (- 20±5°C) until the day of  use. 
• ST266 in single -use plastic ampoules must be stored refrigerated (2 -8°C) until the 
day of use.  
10.4. Study Drug Preparation  
The study staff assigned and trained for “product handling” will transfer ST266 to a 5 mL tube  
(RNase, DNase and p yrogen free) that is then provided to the dental clinic.  
• ST266 in single -use glass vials must be thawed prior to dispensing 1.5 mL of ST266 
to a 5 mL tube.  
• ST266 contained in a single -use plastic ampoule is ready to use. Approximately, 
1.3±0.2 mL of ST266 is transferred t o a 5 mL tube . 
10.5. Administration  
In the dental clinic, the Eppendorf pi[INVESTIGATOR_176986] 1 mL  of ST266. Twenty (20) microliters (10 μL to buccal surfaces and 10 μL to 
lingual surfaces) of ST266 will be appl ied directly to each tooth at the gingival margin  by [CONTACT_177007]. The t otal daily dose will be less than [ADDRESS_207183] handling and accountability.

drug accountability has been performed by [CONTACT_177008]. Unopened containers  of 
study drug will be returned to Stemnion  after accountability is performed at the end of the study 
for each site.  
10.8. Placebo  
Commercially available sterile saline (0.9%  NaCl ) will be supplied to the clinical site by [CONTACT_177009] (treatment for G roup 3) for the study. Sterile saline is stored at 
room temperature as indicated by [CONTACT_177010]. Sterile saline will be 
applied in the same manner and in the same volume as the investigational product, ST266. 
Accountability, handling , and disposal procedures are the same as for the study drug.

    11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
11.1. Criteria for Primary and S econdary Efficacy Endpoint Evaluation s: 
a. Pocket  Depth (PD): Periodontal pocket depth will be determined with a UNC -15 
periodontal probe at 6 sites per tooth , and rounded to the next lower whole millimeter.  
b. Clinical Attachment Level (CAL): The measurem ent of the position of the soft tissue 
in relation to the cemento -enamel junction (CEJ) that is a fixed point, using probing 
depth and the distance from the gingival margin to the CEJ.  
c. Bleeding On Probing (BOP): Dichotomous score of 0 or 1 indicating whether the site 
bleeds upon probing is performed independently of the gingival index  measurement. 
Bleeding on probing will be measured from the 6 sites of the tooth as a secondary periodontitis variable:  
0 = No bleeding 
1 = Bleeding within 15 seconds following  probing 
11.2. Exploratory Evaluations  
a. Cytokine/Chemokine Analysis: In order to detect the changes in local (GCF) and 
systemic (blood serum) levels of pro- inflammatory mediators, enzymes, and bone 
markers that are known to play a role in the tissue destruction a nd bone 
resorption/formation, analysis will be analyzed in the of GCF and serum specimens. 
For this purpose, pro -inflammatory mediators including, cytokines /chemokines 
(IL-1b, IL -6, IL -8, IL -17A), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including MMP -1, 
MMP -8, and MMP -9, and bone markers (RANKL , Osteoprotegrin) will be analyzed. 
Crevicular fluid sampl es will be obtained from up to [ADDRESS_207185] dose of 
ST266, and before dosing on Days 15, 90, 180, and 270, if applicable. Cytokine analysis will also be o btained from serum samples collected at baseline and on 
Days  15, 90, 180, and 270. 
b. Microbial Analysis: To detect subgingival microflora, subgingival plaque samples from the [ADDRESS_207186] PD will be collected at baseline and on Days 15, 90, 180, and 270, and analyzed using a DNA -DNA hybridization technique to provide a 
qualitative and semi- quantitative assessment of oral bacteria including: Treponema 
denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Centruroides gracilis, Campylobacter re ctus, Campylobacter showae, Eubacterium nodatum, 
Fusobacterium periodonticum, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorph, Fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum vincenti, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococ cus constellatus, Streptococcus 
gordonii, Streptococcus intermedia, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eik enella 
corrodens, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Actinomyces israelli, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, 
Eubacterium saburreum, Gemella morbillorum, Leptotrichia bucallis, Neisseria

    mucosa, Propi[INVESTIGATOR_176987], Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus 
anginosus, Selenomonas noxia, and Treponema socranskii. Results will be compared 
with known probe standards and scored on an ordinal scale of 0 to 5 as follows:  
0 = No signal detected  
1 = <105 bacteria  
2 = ~105 bacteria  
3 = >105 bacteria  
4 = ~106 bacteria  
5 = >106 bacteria  
c. Radiographic Bone Level (RBL): Up to four vertical bitewing x -ray radiographs will 
be obtained at baseline and Days 90 and 270. For each time point, a total of two ( 2) 
radiographs wil l be taken from each side of the mouth. Crestal bone levels will be 
measured in mm relative to the CEJ, and changes in bone levels at Days 90 and 270 will be calculated relative to the baseline measurement. This procedure will be standardized for all sites , and radiographs will be interpreted by a central reading 
center.  
d. Full-mouth Plaque Index (FMPI, Turesky modification of Quigley -Hein): Disclosing 
solution will be applied to the teeth and then plaque will be measured at 6 sites of each tooth .  
0 = No plaque  
1 = Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth. 
2 = A thin continuous band of plaque (up to 1 mm) at the cervical margin of the tooth. 3 = A band of plaque wider than [ADDRESS_207187] of the crown 
of the tooth. 
4 = Plaque covering at least one -third but less than two- thirds of the crown of the 
tooth. 
5 = Plaque covering two -thirds or more of the crown of the tooth. 
11.3. Standardization and Calibration of Procedures  
Clinical assessments of PD, CAL, and BOP will be us ed to assess the efficacy of the therapy. 
Radiographic procedures , GCF , FMPI,  and microbial sampling will also be performed.  All of 
these procedures are prone to technique -sensitive sources of variability and require 
standardization and/or  calibration exe rcises to minimize measurement variability. Such training 
exercises at each site will occur prior to the start of screening at each respective site. A dedicated 
oral examiner at the primary clinical center will serve as the “gold standard” examiner for 
calibration sessions. Details of the training protocols  are provided in the Clinical Procedures  
Manual .

    12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
12.1. Safety Parameters  
The scope  of safety monitoring is to assess the potential risks to the participants and ensure the 
safety of the participants during this trial. In order to monitor the data and safety, all necessary 
data including AE/SAE reports, safety reports (from Stemnion), subjects ’ medical/medication 
history, concomitant medication reports, review of subject conduct/compliance, soft and hard tissue evaluations at every visit, and dropout rates will be used and reviewed throughout the study. Serum chemistry including liver and kidney function, complete blood count, and 
urinalysis  will be done at screening , Day  90, and Day 270. I n women of child- bearing potential, 
a pregnancy test will be performed prior to enrollment and again at the last study visit (Day 270).

This section defines the types of AEs and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting them. Information in this section complies with Title 21 C ode 
of Federal R egulations (CFR) Part  312, International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) 
Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and ICH Guideline E 6: Good Clinical Practice : Consolidated Guidance . 
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of AEs regardless o f 
treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE 
and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE requiring  immediate 
notification to the s ponsor or its designated representative . 
12.2.2. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not cons idered related to the subject’s 
participation in the research. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is 
screened will be considered as medical history and not recorded as an AE; however, if the 
condition worsens at any time dur ing the study, it will be r ecorded and reported as an AE.  
All AEs that occur after any subject signed consent , before treatment, during treatment, or within 
[ADDRESS_207191] be recorded.  
12.2.3. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the s ponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)):  
Protocol ST266- PERIO -201 [Stemnion, Inc. BB -IND# 15,825]

    • Death: A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the 
investigator during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be reported to the 
Sponsor whether it is considered treatment related or not . 
• Is life -threatening: An AE or suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is considered 
“life-threaten ing” if, in the view of either the investigator or the s ponsor, its 
occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an 
AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176989], but should be documented in the subject’s medical record. Additional 
details further defining hospit alization criteria can be found in the Clinical Procedures  
Manual . 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
Or 
• Is a medically important condition , i.e., e vents that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176990]. Examples are intensive treatment  in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm , blood dyscrasias , and convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of drug dependency , or drug abuse.  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has signed consent , before treatment, during treatment, or 
within [ADDRESS_207192] be reported to the s ponsor as described in 
Section  12.5.1. 
12.2.4. Severity of AEs/SAEs  
The study site will grade  the severity of AEs experienced by [CONTACT_177011]:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with  inability to perform normal activities)  
• Life-threatening  
Note:  The terms serious and severe are not synonymous. Serious criteria as defined in 
Section  12.2.3 above serve as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obl igations. The term 
severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
Protocol ST266- PERIO -201 [Stemnion, Inc. BB -IND# 15,825]  
Amendment #3   
  Version: 08 September 2017

    or severe headache); the event itself, however, may be of relativ ely minor medical significance. 
This is not the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Therefore, an AE of 
severe headache might not be considered serious, but a moderate infection for which a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176991].  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug and Expectedness  
An investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
invest igational product for each AE ( not related, possibly  related , or definitely  related). The 
investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused b y the investigational product. If no valid reason 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related.” If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship 
between the investigational pr oduct and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “related.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational produ ct is determined to be 
“possibly ” or “definitely ,” the event will be considered to be related to the investi gational 
product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
The s ponsor’s determination of attribution will be used for reporting to the appropriate health 
authorities. The relation of an AE to study participation will be determined using the desc riptors 
and definitions provided in Table 6. Additionally, in this study there are no suspected SAEs and 
all SAEs will be considered s uspected unexpect ed serious a dverse r eactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  
Table  6: Attribution of Adverse Events  
Not related  The AE is clearly not related.  
Possibl y 
related  The AE has a reasonable possibility to be related; there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
Definite ly 
related  The AE is clearly related.  
12.4. Collection and Recording Adverse Events  
12.4.1. Period of Collection  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the end of 
the study. All AEs and SAEs that occur after any subject has signed consent, before treatment, 
during treatment, or within [ADDRESS_207193] be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Methods of Collection  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant  
Protocol ST266- PERIO -201 [Stemnion, Inc. BB -IND# 15,825]  
Amendment #3   
  Version: 08 September 2017   
32 
    • Questioning the participant in an unbiased and non- leading manner  
• Receiving an unsolicite d complaint from the participant  
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by [CONTACT_20616] r to be clinically significant.  If this is the case, it must be 
recorded in the source docum ent and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluation 
that produced the value or result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is stable , establishing a new baseline and the participant’s safety is not at risk. 
An abnor mal lab oratory  value recorded at screening is not considered an AE, but is treated as a 
preexisting condition and should be recorded in the subject’s medical history.  
12.4.2. Recording Method  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, the investigator will record AEs on the appropriate eCRF regardless of their severity or relation to the study product. The investigator will treat participants 
experiencing AEs appropriately and observe them at suitable intervals until their symptoms 
resolve or their status stabilizes.  
Once recorded, an AE will be followed until  it either; resolves with or without sequelae , the 
subject ends study participation, [ADDRESS_207194] prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the 
study, whichever occurs first.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events will be recorded on the AE eCRF and on the SAE eCRF, and health 
authorities will be notified as outlined in Section  12.5.2. 
12.5. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
After learning that a participant has experienced an AE, the investigator or designee is 
responsible for recording  the AE  in the eCRF , regardless of relationship or expectedness . If the 
AE is determined to be s erious, expedited reporting is required per Section 12.5.1. 
12.5.1. Reporting SAEs  to the Sponsor  
The following process for reporting a n SAE ensures compliance with [ADDRESS_207195] include the following: 
• Reporter  
• Subject ID  
• Serious AE term  
• Relationship to study m edication(s)  
Protocol ST266- PERIO -201 [Stemnion, Inc. BB -IND# 15,825]  
Amendment #3   
  Version: 08 September 2017   
33 
    • Reason why the event is serious  
Supplemental eCRF pages should be current at the time of SAE reporting: medical history, 
concomitant medications, demographics, and death as applicable. If an SAE is related or possibly 
related, unblinding may occur per Section  9.4. 
Unavailable details of the event should not delay submission of the known information. As additional details become available, the SAE eCRF should be updated and re -submitted via the 
EDC  system. Every time the SAE eCRF is submitted, it should be signed by [CONTACT_177012]-investigator.

12.5.2. Reporting SAEs to Health Authorities  
The Sponsor will report Investigational New Drug (IND) Safety Reports to the F ood and D rug 
Administration (FDA)  and investigators in accordance with the FDA regulations detailed in 
[ADDRESS_207197] be reported by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor to the appropriate 
health authorities within 15 calendar day s; fatal or life -threatening events must be reported 
within 7 calendar days.  
12.5.3. Reporting SAEs to IRB(s) or Ethics Committee(s)  
It is the responsibility of the investigators to promptly notify their respective IRB(s) or 
independent e thics c ommittee(s)  (IECs)  of IND Safety reports or other matters involving risk to 
patients as mandated by [CONTACT_1026]/ IECs.  
S[LOCATION_003]Rs are to be reported to the investigators and to the IRBs/IECs when the following conditions occur:  
• The event must be an SAE. 
• There must be a certain degree of probability that the event is an adverse reaction 
from the administered drug.  
• The adverse reaction must be unexpected, that is to say, not foreseen in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.

the subject will be withdrawn from the study and followed unti l the pregnancy comes to term.  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all available pregnancy information within 
[ADDRESS_207199] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Any pregnancy complication or premature terminations including miscarriage, spontaneous 
abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical  reasons will be reported as an SAE, 
as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. Elective abortions for no medical reason and without 
complications should not be handled as AEs. Should the pregnancy result in a congenital abnormality or birth defect, a separate SAE report must be submitted. Furthermore, all neonatal 
deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_207200] to causality. In addition, any infant  death that occurs after the 30 -day reporting period that the 
investigator suspects is related to the in utero  exposure to the study treatment shoul d also be 
reported .

treatment comparisons will be modeled through a generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) 
method (with a linear link and exchangeable covariance matrix), adjusting for the baseline value. 
Methods of analysis for p eriodontal microbial flora profiles , inflammatory cytokine levels in  
GCF and in serum and RBL will be described in separate statistical analyses plans.  Results will 
be considered significant if p <0. 05. 
13.1. Analysis Populations  
Statistical analyse s will be based on the analysis populations as defined below:  
• Safety population:  All randomized subjects who use at least one dose of study drug, 
regardless of whether or not they undergo any study assessments. 
• Intention- to-Treat ( ITT) population:  All randomized subjects . 
• Per Protocol ( PP) population:  All subjects who use at least one  dose of study drug and 
do not deviate from the protocol  as per the statistical analysis plan .  
Further details regarding the specific analyses associated with each study population are provided in the statistical analysis p lan. 
13.2. Prevention and Treatment of  Missing Data  
Efforts will be made by [CONTACT_23638] i nvestigators to maximize subject compliance with the 
study protocol. Previous studies of adjunctive treatments for periodontitis reported subject 
completion rates >90% (Paquette, 2004). Because this st udy requires a significant number of 
in-office  treatments, a more conservative estimate of a 20% dropout rate  has been made , which is 
reflected in the  sample size calculation (Section  7.2).  
Missing data in this study will be treated according to standard practices based on published 
recommendations of the National Research Council Panel on Handling Missing Data in Clinical Trials ( National Research Council, 2010) . Methods for imputation of missing data are provided 
in the statistical analysis plan.

Amendment #3   
  Version: [ADDRESS_207202] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study, a representative for the sponsor  
will visit the investigational study site to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Stemnion  or its representati ves. This will 
be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Stemnion  and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor  or representative for the sponsor will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountabili ty checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the subject ’s medical records at the clinical site , and other records relevant to 
the study. T his will require direct acces s to all original records for each subject  (e.g. , 
clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the sponsor . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on case report forms, any SAEs 
have been forwarded to Stemnio n and SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been 
forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Quality control and quality assurance may be performed before, during, and after the study  by 
[CONTACT_177013]. Regulatory authorities in certain countries reserve the right 
to audit study sites following submission of data i n regulatory applications. The i nvestigator may 
be given due notice of any intended audit by a regulatory body. By [CONTACT_177014] 1572, the i nvestigator acknowledges that these inspection procedures may take place 
and agrees to provide access to the required subject  records and other stud y documentation. 
Furthermore, the i nvestigator agrees to inform the sponsor  immediately of any known or 
suspected inspection by [CONTACT_177015]. If the investigator does not comply with the protocol, GCP, or regulations, Stemnion, Inc. reserves the right to di squalify the i nvestigator and/or site from the 
current or future protocols.

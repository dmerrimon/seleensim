Study Title (ID)  Effect of Curved Design Soft -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]® on Plaque Accumulation on Patients 
with Signs of Gingivitis  
Project   
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new interdental cleaning 
device called Soft -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]® Advanced, as compared to a leading brand floss; 
and, how ease of use can promote the establishment of a hygienic routine of 
cleaning interproximal spaces. The Soft -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]® Advanced has a new design 
allowing a user to easily access to difficult interdental s ites, such as spaces 
between premolars and molars. As compared to conventional Soft -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]®, it 
has a unique handle design with an increase in thickness.  This study is a single 
center with parallel design, single blinded, which will randomize eligible 
subjects into two treatment groups.  
 
Subjects  
 
  
It is planned that 53 subjects will be enrolled and randomized with 15% 
dropout, in order to complete with a minimum of 44 subjects (22 subjects per 
treatment group) which is eligible for statistical analysis .   
Subjects must:  
• be age 18 -70 years  
• be routine manual toothbrush users  
• have no or little[1] experience with interproximal cleaning devices, such as 
floss or interdental brush  
• have signs and symptoms of gingivitis, defined by: [CONTACT_368508] ≤4mm and BOP 
≥10% but ≤50% of sites.  
 
Subjects must not: 
• have participated in an oral care study in the previous 90 days  
 
Subjects may not: 
• have any tooth site with  >5mm PD or  >3mm attachment loss

Introduction & Product Description  
 
Product Description:  
 
In order to maintain good gingival and periodontal health, the most effective approach is 
to regularly remove bacterial biofilm, which poses threats to develop gingivitis and likely 
periodontitis, if unremoved. The biofilm is removed by [CONTACT_368510], a most known 
method; however there is still a risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_368489], especially in interproximal spaces. Interproximal spaces are naturally 
difficult to reach for plaque removal. The teeth contours are different among people;  
therefore there has been need of interproximal cleaning devices, such as floss and 
interdental brushes. Along with such product development, there have been many clinical 
studies which succeeded in showing that the combination of using a toothbrush and 
interproximal cleaning devices improve the reduction in biofilm accumulation. This 
practice  is recommended by [CONTACT_368511] (ADA)[3]: 
 
The ADA recommends brushing twice a day and cleaning between teeth with 
floss (or another interdental cl eaner) once a day.  
 
According to the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) survey[4], 27% of US 
adults have admitted they have provided false information regarding their flossing routine 
to their dentists. In addition, the survey shows that 36% of Americans would rather do an 
unpleasant activity, such as cleaning the toilet, rather than f lossing. This indicates that 
establishing a routine to floss regularly is difficult and challenging, yet it has been 
recommended that with regular brushing, interproximal cleaning is an important aspect to 
maintain good gingival and periodontal health.  
 
In order to overcome such patient compliance problem, different types of interproximal 
cleaning devices have been developed and released in the market. Since their release, 
interdental brushes have gained popularity because they are easy to use. Soft -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]®  by 
[CONTACT_368512] G·U·M is one of the many types of interdental cleaning devices in the market; 
however, it has a unique design that is different from other devices. It has an 
advantageous design which uses gentle rubber bristles (small ridges), as compared to 
regular nylon bristles, which can potentially cause gingival irritation and trauma.  
 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new interdental device called Soft -
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]® Advanced, as compared to a leading brand floss, and how ease of use can 
promote the establishment of a hygienic routine of cleaning interproximal spaces. The 
Soft-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]® Advanced has a new design allowing a user to easily access difficult 
interdental spaces, such as spaces between premolars and molars. As compared to 
conventiona l Soft -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]®, it has a unique handle design with an increase in thickness and 
curvature.

examinations, dental prophylaxis, tooth brushing and use of manual interdental oral 
hygiene devices. R isks are not limited to but may include the following:  
• Gingival inflammation, irritation, bleeding or abrasion from tooth brushing and/or 
use of the investigational (interdental) devices.  
• Minor pain, discomfort and bleeding may be present during periodont al probing.  
• Gingival and/or tooth pain or sensitivity, loosened or damaged dental restorations 
may occur as a result dental prophylaxis  
• Jaw soreness may occur as a result of opening the mouth for examinations and

Justification of Treatment Periods and Regimens  
 
Visit 1 : Screening and enrollment    
Study participants are consented and selected based on a standard set of eligibility criteria 
in order to limit exposure to subjects who may experience undue risk by [CONTACT_368513], 
and to select a panel exhibiting moderate levels of plaque accumulation and mild level of 
gingival inflammation, in whom a response may be evaluated over time.  
 
Visit 2 : Baseline    
This is a baseline assessment following 21 days from the screen ing and enrollment visit. 
The randomization and assignment of home use treatment regimen are defined.  
 
Visit 3 : Two (2) weeks follow -up   
This is the first efficacy assessment following 14 days of the assigned home use regimen, 
as well as the mid -point saf ety visit.  It was selected as a point in time deemed sufficient 
to elicit responses in both the clinical and sub -clinical manifestations of change in oral 
health status, should any changes occur.  
 
Visit 4 : Four (4) weeks follow -up   
This is the secondary efficacy assessment following [ADDRESS_461214] signs and symptoms of gingivitis. Complete 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  are provided in Section 4.0.  
 
 
Statement of Compliance  
This study is being conducted according to the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practices 
(GCPs).  All study materials are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_368514] 
(IRB) prior to enrollment of any subject or dispense of any test article. The eth ical 
 
Protocol Version   V6  
October 20, [ADDRESS_461215] completed Human Subjects Protection 
Training and Good Clinical Practice Training. A copy of each person’s completion 
certificate is maintained in the GO Health Center and will be added to the Study Master 
File. All study staff will receive training on all aspects of the protocol. Study personnel 
will ensure that the research study is conducted, r ecorded and reported in accordance with 
the protocol, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and 
the applicable regulatory requirements. The study coordinator will monitor source 
documentation daily to ensure that data fields ar e complete and accurately reflect study 
activities.  
 
Study Objective(s)  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the possible difference in interproximal 
plaque accumulation between lead -brand floss users and Soft -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]® Advanced (non -
wired interdental brush) users  
 
Secondary Objective(s)  
The secondary objectives focus on the relationship between a user and a product. This is 
important due to the fact that periodontal preventative care is mostly accomplished by a 
public he alth approach; therefore the secondary objectives of the study are:  
 
 
Also the secondary objective of the study contains evaluation of the possible difference in 
gingival inflammation between lead -brand floss users and Soft -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483]® Advanced (non -
wired interdental brush) users

A summary of activities and evaluations at each study visit is outlined in Sec tion 5.0.   
 
Controls to Minimize Bias  
In order to minimize bias, all study participants will be randomly allocated to a treatment 
assignment.  Additionally, applicable staff member(s) who are performing efficacy 
assessments will be blinded to the treatment assignment of the study subjects.    
 
Subjects shall be allocated to the treatment groups according to a pre -defined 
randomization schedule.  Randomization will be blocked by [CONTACT_368517].  
  
The blinded staff member(s), e.g., Examiners, shall be blinded to the treatment 
allocation of the study subjects at the time of randomization and efficacy 
evaluation period.  All other personnel involved with the conduct of this study 
will not be blinded.  If the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_368490] a capacity that 
requires that he/she directly assess an efficacy endpoint, he/she shall be blinded 
until all efficacy endpoint evaluations are completed.  
 
Product allocation shall be reported in a database so that compliance and 
randomization can be monitored for accuracy.  H owever, the blinded staff 
member(s) shall not have access to the database until all efficacy evaluations are 
completed.

Efficacy Assessments  
Parameters of Efficacy  
The primary efficacy measure for this study is reduction in interproximal plaque 
accumulation from baseline as evaluated by [CONTACT_368531] -PI [CONTACT_43638] 14 (2 weeks) and 28 
days (4 weeks) of home -use. MQH -PI [INVESTIGATOR_368499] (Visit 2) to post 14 days (Visit 3) and 28 days (Visit 4) of home 
use in plaque index score. A designated site plaque assessment shall be performed u sing 
the Lobene - Turesky Modification of the Quigley -Hein Plaque Index. Plaque removal 
will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_11338] (i.e. anterior interproximal and posterior 
interproximal).  Overall and for each region, plaque score will be calculated as the  total 
number of sites classified as having plaque present divided by [CONTACT_368532].  
 
Secondary efficacy parameter is reduction in gingival inflammation from baseline as 
evaluated by [CONTACT_84041] -GI, [COMPANY_003] and BOP following 28 days (4 weeks) of home -use.  
UNC -GI score will be calculated as the sum of scores of all evaluable sites divided by [CONTACT_368533]. UNC -GI score will be expressed as the raw average score for a 
subject, as a reduction from baseline (baseline score minus post -baseline score), and as 
percent reduction calculated as the reduction in UNC -GI score divided by [CONTACT_368534] -GI score times 100. Same score evaluation will be performed for [COMPANY_003] and BOP, 
which is baseline score minus post -baseline score, and as for cal culating percent 
reduction, the reduction in [COMPANY_003]/BOP score will be divided by [CONTACT_368535]/BOP 
score times 100.  
 
 
 Methods and Timing of Assessing and Analyzing Efficacy Variables  
MQH -PI, UNC -GI, [COMPANY_003] and BOP will be assessed at baseline (i.e., Study Vi sit 2), post 
[ADDRESS_461243] 28 days for all other indices, of home use (i.e., 
Study Visits 3 and Visit 4).  Participants will be instructed to abstain from brushing [ADDRESS_461244] signs the Informed 
Consent Form until conclusion of the study.  Any event, however, that is a UADE (see 
Section 7.2) in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_368500] (see  
Section 7.6).  Subject safety shall be monitored to detect any deviations in the 
medical/dental status present at baseline.   
 
 
Protocol Version   V6  
October 20, [ADDRESS_461245] 02883244  31 Concomitant Medications  
At Visit 1, baseline concomitant medications shall be source documented and reviewed 
by [CONTACT_737] /Examiner against eligibility criteria.  Only changes to baseline 
medications (i.e., changes to amount, frequency, etc.) or new medications require 
reporting in the CRFs.  Changes shall be reviewed with the Investigator/ and study 
coordinator for ‘reportab le’ Adverse Events.  
 
Adverse Events   
At Visit 1, a medical/dental history form is provided to each participant and is reviewed 
with the participant by [CONTACT_737]/Examiner to establish baseline health status.  
Relevant historical and current health i nformation is noted.  Additionally, an oral exam 
further identifies baseline dental status.  At all subsequent study visits, adverse changes 
from the baseline medical/dental status of each participant is assessed via participant 
interview, diary review, or al exams, etc.  The subject may report adverse events and 
changes to con meds by [CONTACT_368536].  
 
The following adverse changes from baseline require reporting  as Adverse Events in the 
eCRF s: 
 
• Any adverse change that has either of the following relations to the test 
products or study procedures:  ‘possibly related’ or ‘related’  
• Any adverse change which occurs in/around the oral cavity, regardless of 
relationship status  
• Any event that is an U nanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE, see section 
7.2) 
 
An adverse change that does not meet any of the above does not require reporting to the 
Sponsor (or the CRFs).   
 
 
Protocol Version   V6  
October 20, [ADDRESS_461246] 02883244  32 Examples of reportable AEs and non -reportable AEs include, but are not limited to:  
 
Reportable AEs  Non-reportable AEs  
• abrasion in /around the oral cavity  • broken bone  
• lost tooth  • cold symptoms  
• tooth sensitivity  • headache, if it isn’t at least possibly 
related to study participation  • mucosal fibroma  
• noticeable increase in gingival inflammation  • infection, if it isn’t at least possibly 
related to study participation  • oral ulceration  
• palatal burn  • cold sore  
• gum irritation / soreness  • cheek bite  
• papi[INVESTIGATOR_368501] / trauma  • linea alba  
• damaged restoration  • loosened filling  
 • dry or cracked lips  
  
   
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
A UADE is defined in the [LOCATION_002] 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 812.3(s) as 
“any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan 
or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects”.  
 
Other important medical events which may not result in any of the outcomes above, but 
which may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above, may in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574], be considered a UADE.  
 
Any UADE requires immediate reporting to the Sponsor upon discovery:

E-mail: [EMAIL_7088]  
Tel:  [PHONE_7614] 
 
 
Parameters of Safety  
Parameters of safety include reportable (see Section 7.1) adverse changes in the medical 
and/or dental status of the subject from the time of assignment of investigational products 
until completion of the study or resolution of the event, as appropriate.  Additional 
parameters of safety include review of concomitant medications and deviation or 
violations from the protocol for each participant.  
 
Methods and Timing of Assessing and Analyzing Safety Variables  
Safety v ariables are assessed in a verbal interview and examinations at each follow -up 
study visit in which the participant’s current medical and dental status is reviewed 
compared to baseline, and a determination is made about the relation of any events to the 
study participation.  In addition, the oral examination conducted at these visits is also 
used to screen for adverse events with relevant safety information recorded.  Lastly, any 
 
Protocol Version   V6  
October 20, [ADDRESS_461247] in between visits is assessed upon reporti ng as 
described above.  
 
Procedures for Reporting Safety Events  
Reportable Adverse Events, as described in Section 7.1, shall be recorded in the eCRFs, 
and an assessment shall be made by [CONTACT_079]/designee of the following 
metrics for each event:  severity, serious, anticipated (if serious), relation (to study 
participation and device), action taken and outcome.  Options for each of these metrics 
can be found in the Source Document Template Adverse Events Log form.  
 
All a dverse events that are serious and occurring in the mouth; or serious and at 
least possibly related to the study, as well as all UADEs (see Section 7.2) are to be 
reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_461248] :  Akane Takemura  
E-mail:  [EMAIL_7088]  
Tel:  847 -794-4276  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_368502]/EC as dictated by [CONTACT_368538]/EC.   
 
All other safety events that do not meet the expedited reporting criteria as 
described above are collected at the time of reporting by [CONTACT_2299], or 
detection by [CONTACT_093].  They are recorded and maintaine d as part of the 
study record and reported to the Sponsor via the eCRF.    
 
The disposition of all safety events, assignment of relatedness, seriousness is the 
responsibility of the Principal Investigator.   
 
Disposition and Follow -up of Adverse Events  
An adverse event that is present at the time of study completion is to be designated as 
ongoing on the eCRF (i.e., ‘Recovering/Resolving’ or ‘Not Recovered/Not Resolved’).  
However, all ongoing events that require expedited reporting, as described in Section 7.5, 
or other important medical findings, per the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are to be 
followed until resolution.  
 
 
Statistical and Analytical Plan  
Determination of Sample Size  
The primary endpoint of this study is to distinguish the difference in measured 
interproximal plaque indices between two treatment groups after 14 -day and 28 -day of 
using a different kind of interproximal cleaning device. Therefore the determination of 
sample size is based on the following equation and parameters [1]:

Participant compliance will be listed by [CONTACT_1570]. If applicable, comparabili ty 
between the treatment groups will be evaluated using a Chi -square or Fisher’s exact test 
as appropriate for categorical variables, and one way ANOVA for continuous variables. 
A listing of all deviations will be presented.  
 
 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy measure for this study is reduction in plaque index as evaluated by 
[CONTACT_368515] -PI [CONTACT_43638] 14 days (2 weeks) and 28 days (4 weeks) of home use.  MQH -PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_368503]. MQH -PI [INVESTIGATOR_368504] a participant, as a reduction from baseline 
(baseline score minus post -baseline score), and as percent reduction calculated as the  
reduction in MQH -PI [INVESTIGATOR_368505] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_368506] 100.  
 
The following hypothesis will be tested:  
Ho: U MQHPI -SP – UMPI-floss = 0 
HA: U MQHPI -SP – UMPI-floss ≠ [ADDRESS_461253] baseline efficacy evaluation as follows:   
Yij = µ + b i + λj + ε ij  
 
Where:  
Yijk denotes the overall change (or percent reduction) in MQH -PI [INVESTIGATOR_368507] e participant i, 
treatment j, i = 1,2,…, N; j = 1,2,3,4.  
 
µ denotes the overall mean.  
bi denotes the baseline efficacy level corresponding to ith subject.  
λj denotes the fixed effect corresponding to the jth treatment.  
 
Protocol Version   V6  
October 20, [ADDRESS_461254] 02883244  36 εij denotes the unexplained or residual variation.  
 
In addition, the following assumptions will be made:  
εij ~ N(0,σ2) for all i=1, 2,…,N; for all j = 1,2,...M; where N denotes the total number of 
participants , M  denotes the total number of treatments.  
 
Analysis of the statistical model above will be performed using Mixed model.  If the 
required assumptions for the mixed model are violated, transformation of the data or non -
parametric procedures may be used.  Superiority will be declared based on the F -test.   In 
addition, least square means (LSM) and 95% confidence interval for the means will be 
presented.  
 
Supplementary analyses will be performed with sex as a covariate in the model.  Least 
squares means, SEs of the least square means, and two -sided 95% CIs  will be presented 
by [CONTACT_368541].  
 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The secondary efficacy measure for this study is the reduction from baseline for UNC -GI 
and BOP (after 28 days). UNC -GI will be calculated as described above.  BOP will be 
calculat ed as the number of sites classified as having bleeding present divided by [CONTACT_368533].  BOP score will be expressed as the raw average score for a 
participant, as a reduction from baseline to post 28 days of home use, and as percent 
reduction calculated as the reduction in BOP score divided by [CONTACT_368542] 100. Additionally, the number and percent of bleeding sites will be evaluated. Any 
site with a BOP score =1 will be counted as a bleeding site. The percent of sites blee ding 
will be calculated as the number of sites with BOP score =[ADDRESS_461255] square means, and 
two-sided 95% CIs. In addition, [COMPANY_003] will be analyzed using [ADDRESS_461256] 
squares means, SEs of the means, and two -sided 95% CIs will be presented by [CONTACT_368543]. In addition all primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed using 
a repeated measure appro ach.

 SYNOPSIS 
Title of Study:  Safety and Performance of Q - -Suture Anchor System  
Study Design:  A retrospective, multi -center, case series  
Study Type:  Observational ,  post-market ,  clinical follow -up study  
Study Product:  Q- -Suture Anchor System  
Model Specification 
72290123 1.8MM MINI 
25-1800 1.8MM 
25-2800 2.8MM  
Study Purpose:  Post -market clinical f ollow -up needed to address existing clinical dat a 
and gaps on the existing Q-Fix   device and meet existing 
MDD/MEDDEV requirements  
Primary Objective:  To assess the  safety and performance data  of the Q - -Suture 
Anchor System. 
Statistical Rationale: The study sample was decided based on the feasibility of recruitment, 
enrollment and follow-up considerations. Based on the results of a 
1.8% failure rate for the Q-Fix  Suture Anchor in the study conducted 
by [CONTACT_248305]25, it is reasonable to estimate a success rate of 95% for 
the Q-Fix  Suture Anchors in this study. The proportions of clinical 
success as defined in this study will be displayed with a confidence 
interval.  
Sample Size: A total minimum sample size of 90 subjects is proposed with a 
maximum of 450 subjects (depending on market share) for approved 
joint indications. Please see table below for enrollment distribution

 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 BACKGROUND  
Bone anchor fixation devices are typi[INVESTIGATOR_693959] a variety of repairs in the shoulder, elbow, 
hand/wrist, hip, knee and foot/ankle. There are numerous alternative therapy options associated with 
these indications including conservative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693960], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs  (NSAIDs), injection of steroids with lidocaine, and physical therapy. Several clinical studies were 
identified that reported higher clinical outcomes, or the ability to return to previous level of activity 1,2 , 
or lower complication/reinjury rate 2,3 in patients that were treated surgically rather than conservatively. 
When conservative therapy does not offer relief of symptoms for the patient, surgical intervention is 
often recommended. One method of surgical intervention is to repair using an implant such as an 
interference screw or suture anchor. Interference screws provide a press fit between bone to bone, or 
bone to graft/tendon whereas suture anchors approximate soft tissue with an implant embedded in the 
bone. The use of suture anchors may provide advantages such as reduced operative time, ease of access 
to the site of implantation, improved suture material, decreased stress along the suture line, greater 
repair strength, and improved consistency of load-to-failure characteristics 4-7. Patient bone density, 
repair location, potential allergies, the operation being performed and surgeon preference determine 
the size, type and composition of the anchor needed to secure the soft tissue to the bone 8.  
 
Non-absorbable, soft suture anchors have recently been introduced for use in arthroscopic or open soft 
tissue to bone reattachment. Soft suture anchors or all-suture anchors are completely suture-based 
implants. The anchors usually come with single or double loaded suture options. Soft anchors are 
usually smaller than hard anchors; hence the volume of bone removed is less, which is especially helpful 
should subsequent revision be necessary9-10. Additionally, the small size enables placement of anchors in 
very close proximity to each other allowing multiple sutures/fixation points per unit area of soft tissue9. 
The few studies that have investigated all-suture anchor biomechanics, such as cyclic loading and pullout 
mechanics, suggest that they are comparable to traditional anchors10-13. Soft anchors have also been

Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], manufacturers of anchor systems market suture anchors preloaded with suture(s) that the 
anchor has been designed and tested wit
will specify the type of suture and how many strands may be used with an anchor. Suture anchors are 
continuously evolving to improve anchor strength and to facilitate arthroscopic or open procedures. Soft 
suture anchors are the newer anchors on the market that have pursued fixation differently with the all-
suture design. The JuggerKnot 1.[ADDRESS_941328]-market clinical follow-up needed to address existing clinical data and gaps on the existing Q-Fix

suture loaded) sizes; is manufactured from braided polyester with ultra-high molecular weight 
polyethylene (UHMWPE) suture; and is pre-loaded into a disposable tool designed to facilitate direct 
insertion into a pre-drilled or pre-punched bone hole. Table 8.1-[ADDRESS_941331] description of the Q-Fix- Suture Anchor System.  
 
The Q-FixMINI Suture Anchor minimizes bone removal by [CONTACT_693970] 5mm. 
This drill depth of 17.1mm is approximately 23% shorter than the existing Q- Fix 1.8mm anchor.

relationship to study device and outcome. Incidences and number of subjects reporting device 
deficiencies will also be summarized. Further summaries of safety data may be described in the SAP. 
 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION 
 Precision Analysis will be used to assess the overall proportion of success for the Q-Fix All-Suture 
Anchor System. Then assuming a 5% lost to follow-up rate after the first year, a minimum of 90 subjects 
will be enrolled (based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria) in order to complete 84 evaluable subjects. 
The 90 subjects will be enrolled to allow a minimum of 28 patients with each of the following indications 
to be recruited: Shoulder, Hip and Knee. Based on the results of the By[CONTACT_26753]25 study which showed an 
failure rate of 1.6% in the use of the Q-Fix -Suture Anchor System, this number of subjects is 
sufficient to estimate the proportion of success rate to within 11% by [CONTACT_693974]-sided 95% 
confidence interval (based on an estimate of the rate of clinical success being 95%). 
 ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES 
Adverse Events (AE) related to the study implant, or procedure including Adverse Device Effects (ADE), 
Serious Adverse Device Effects (SADE), Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), and Device 
Deficiencies (DevD) occurring from the time of the surgery until revision or study completion must be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF and reported. If the event is known to have been previously reported 
to Smith & Nephew, this must be noted on the CRF.  After consent, in addition to all events related to 
the implant or the procedure, all serious adverse events (SAE), regardless of causality, must be recorded 
on the appropriate CRF and reported to the Sponsor and IRB if necessary. Events leading to a revision 
should be reported at all times regardless of causality.   
 
Adverse Device Effects (ADE) occurring after study completion will be handled as product complaints 
reportable by [CONTACT_573367].

Related    An AE is considered to be related to the use of an IP or the procedure when there is a 
POSSIBLE, PROBABLE, or DEFINITE relationship between the AE and the use of the IP or the 
procedure. 
An ADE is further categorized depending on whether the criteria in section 14.1.3 and 14.1.4 are met. 
14.1.3 Serious Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Device Effects  
An AE or ADE is considered a SAE or SADE if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, it: 
 Results in death. 
 Is life-threatening ( NOTE -
event/reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it 
does not refer to an event/ reaction which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe). 
 Requires in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316886]. 
 Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Is a medically important event or reaction. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be 
considered serious such as important medical events that might not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693961]. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

TMP-[ADDRESS_941361] (ASADE) is a serious ADE that does not meet the criteria 
for a [LOCATION_003]DE.  
14.1.5 Severity  
The severity of every AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_693975]. AE should be 
classified as mild, moderate, or severe, regardless of whether or not the AE are considered to be serious 
or non-serious. The classification should be based on the following definitions: 
Mild   -  An event is mild if the subject is aware of, but can easily tolerate the sign or symptom; 
Moderate - An event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant enough to  
Severe -    An event is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the inability 
to work or engage in their usual activities. 
14.1.6 Device Deficiency 
A Device Deficiency (DevD) is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety or performance. DevD includes malfunctions, use errors and inadequate 
labelling.  
14.2 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
AEs of any kind and DevDs will be recorded in the applicable CRF and source notes. The Investigator will 
evaluate all AEs for relationship to the device and procedure, if applicable, seriousness, and severity.

23.3   PROTOCOL AMENDMENT #1 
 General Purpose 
The purpose for this amendment is to:   
1) Decrease age limit to >13 years to include adolescents as it was determined that the Q-Fix  anchor is 
being used by [CONTACT_693981]; it is important to obtain information on the safety and performance in 
the adolescent population as well as in adults. A secondary objective is added so that an analysis may be 
done on adolescents and young adults ages 13-21 years of age. As this retrospective study is granted a 
waiver of informed consent for adults, it is requested for adolescents as well. 
2) Increase enrollment maximum to 450 subjects to allow for the enrollment of adolescents and 
additional Q-Fix  MINI subjects (150 maximum per joint type.) 
3) Revise the timeline to account for the enrollment of adolescents; this amendment is not expected to 
affect the overall study duration.  
4) Include both open and arthroscopic surgeries in the study as it was determined that sites used the Q-
Fix  anchor in both arthroscopic and open soft tissue repair surgeries; it is important to obtain safety 
and performance data for both types of surgery. Also clarified that as the study is collecting real world 
safety data, use in knee, shoulder, and hip may be collected beyond the indications for use. 
5) Clarify that another enrollment date may be used if agreed upon by [CONTACT_693982], as long as a 
bias is not introduced using this date. In addition, the enrollment start date for Q-Fix  MINI may be 
different than the start date for the 1.8 and 2.8mm Q-Fix  anchors to ensure that the data is collected 
on all 3 sizes of the Q-Fix  anchor. 
 Rationale 
The rationale for the changes is as follows: 
1) From the screening and enrollment logs provided by [CONTACT_693983], individuals <18 
years old are receiving Q-Fix  anchors, but this population is not included per the current

contents be disclosed by [CONTACT_125174] & Nephew, nor shall anyone make any use of it that

TMP-[ADDRESS_941375]-market study is to determine the safety and performance of 
the Q-Fix  anchor in populations that are receiving the Q-Fix  anchor, so by [CONTACT_693984], this study is unable to analyze whether the anchor is safe and performs well in a 
population that physicians are already using the Q-Fix  anchor in: individuals aged 13 to 17 
years old. A secondary exploratory analysis will be conducted on adolescents and young adults 
ages 13-21 years of age. Given that the current processes for this retrospective study will not 
change, it is requested that a waiver of consent be extended to include the adolescent 
population as well the adult population.    
2) In order to enroll adolescents, as well as Q-Fix  MINI anchors, the study maximum is increased 
from 360 to 450 subjects (150 subjects per indication).  As the sites will be enrolling subjects that 
were originally excluded, this number is enough to include all adolescents that were previously 
excluded per the site Screening Logs.     
3) In order to enroll adolescents, data collection is increased from 12 to 16 months.  Follow-up is 
expected to take shorter than originally planned; therefore, the overall timeline for the study 
remains at 2.5 years. 
4) Physicians are already using the Q-Fix anchor in both open and arthroscopic surgeries.  In order 
to adequately describe the safety and performance of the Q-Fix  anchor post-market, it is 
important to include both surgery types.  A protocol waiver to include these individuals was 
already granted by [CONTACT_693985]; therefore, the protocol is being revised to capture this information, 
as well as clarifying that the Q-Fix  is indicated for use in soft tissue repair (not just instability). 
Additionally, clarified that as the study is collecting retrospective real world safety and 
performance data, sites may provide data on use in the shoulder, knee, or hip that is not listed in 
the indications for use.   
5) The wording on the statement for enrolling subjects is not clear and there has been confusion in 
interpreting this line by [CONTACT_693986], Investigators will 
consecutively screen subjects by [CONTACT_693987], starting with subjects that have undergone 
arthroscopic tissue repair with Q-Fix  All-Suture Anchor system in the past 12 months as of the

continue to be activated. Vorapaxar is a novel, orally active, competitive and slowly reversible 
protease -activated receptor (PAR) -1 inhibitor, which exerts potent inhibition of thrombin -mediated 
platelet aggregation. It is approved for clinical use by [CONTACT_458142] a history of MI or with peripheral 
arterial disease. A large -scale clinical trial showed that the use of vorapaxar (2.5 mg once/daily) in 
addition to standard antiplatelet therapy (including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196532] a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor ) was 
effective in the s econdary prevention of recurrent thrombotic events in patients with previous

 Background and Significance  
Dual antiplat elet therapy (DAPT) with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] a P2Y [ADDRESS_585148] of care for the long -term secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events  in patients with 
myocardial infarction (MI) [1]. Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_458127] P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor and the 
use of DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458128] (ACS)  [2]. However, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_458129] a prodrug characterized by [CONTACT_458143]  [3]. The novel P2Y 12 receptor 
inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor are characterized by [CONTACT_458144], potent, and predictable 
antiplatelet effects compared with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_458130] a greater reduction of 
ischemic events in ACS patients, at the expense of an increase in major bleeding [4,5]. However, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_458131] -1 (COX -1) and ADP P2Y 12-receptor blockade, rates of ischemic 
recurrences remain high, which may be in part due to the fact that other pl atelet signaling pathways, 
such as thrombin -induced platelet aggregation, continue to be activated and can thus contribute to 
thrombus formation  [2,6,7 ]. In particular, the serine protease thrombin is one of the most potent 
platelet activators and the surf ace of activated platelets is the main source of circulating thrombin, 
especially  following an ACS [6-8]. Vorapaxar  is a novel, orally active, highly selective, competitive 
and slowly reversible protease -activated receptor  (PAR) -1 inhibitor , which  exerts potent  inhibition  
of thrombin -mediated platelet activation and aggregation  [9,10]. After oral administration vorapaxar 
is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_458132] (>90%)  and is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 ( CYP ) 
3A4. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that vorapaxar has a dissociation half -life as long as 20 
hours which leads to consistent pharmacodynamic (PD) effect s [9,10]. Importantly, the re is an

 interplay between purinergic  and thrombin mediated platelet signaling pathways which may result 
in enhanc ed P2Y 12 inhibition when vorapaxar is added to DAPT  [11].  
Recently, vorapaxar (2.5 mg once daily) has been approved for clinical use by [CONTACT_43747] (FDA) for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients 
with a hist ory of MI or with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and must be used in addition to 
standard -of-care antiplatelet therapy with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]  [12]. Vorapaxar has been also 
approved by [CONTACT_458145]  [13]. 
These indications are largely attributed to the findings of the TRA 2P -TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor 
Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events - Thrombolysis in 
Myocardial Infarction 50) trial  [14]. In part icular, the trial showed that the use of vorapaxar (2.5 mg 
once/daily) in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy [including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (94% of patients), a 
thienopyridine, or both (DAPT in 58% of patients; the thienopyridine was clopi[INVESTIGATOR_60467] 99.3% of 
patients)] was effective in the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombotic events (cardiovascular 
death, MI, or stroke) in patients with previous atherothrombosis, in particular in patients with prior 
MI, at the cost of increased bleeding  [14,15 ]. However, the effects of vorapaxar in combination with 
state-of-the-art antiplatelet therapy in the post -MI setting, including prasugrel or ticagrelor,  is 
largely unexplored .  
 
Study Rationale  
To date clinical trial experience with vorapaxar has been almost exclusiv ely with the P2Y [ADDRESS_585149] -MI setting, including prasugrel or ticagrelor, is largely unexplored.

 This may indeed represent a limitatio n for the uptake of vorapaxar in modern day clinical practice 
where these agents are being more broadly utilized [1,2]. This knowledge gap represents an 
important area for exploratory  research as it represents how vorapaxar  could potentially  be used in 
daily clinical practice . Further, given the potent and comprehensive antiplatelet effects achieved 
with the novel P2Y [ADDRESS_585150] been 
questioned [16,17 ]. Prasugrel and ticagrelor are effective in  inhibiting both ADP P2Y 12-dependent 
and thromboxane A2 -dependent pathways of platelet aggregation  [16,17 ]. In particular, the platelet 
inhibi tion achieved by [CONTACT_458146][INVESTIGATOR_34251] a potent P2Y12 -receptor blocker was shown to be no 
greater than that produ ced by [CONTACT_941] P2Y12 -receptor blocker alone in healthy volunteers [16,17 ]. 
Therefore, the role of vorapaxar as part of a dual antithrombotic treatment regimen  including 
prasugrel or ticagrelor and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_458133], represents another important area of clinical  interest  as 
it has the potential to maximize ischemic protection whil e reducing the risk of bleeding . 
 
Study Aims  
 To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of vorapaxar in addition to antiplatelet therapy with 
a novel P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor (prasugrel or t icagrelor) with and without aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458134] a real -world 
setting of post -MI patients . Exploratory assessments on the safety will also be evaluated.

Research Design  
The proposed investigation will be a prospective, randomized, parallel -design, open label , 
PD study conducted in a real world clinical setting of post -MI patients. Patients will be required to 
be on DAPT for at least [ADDRESS_585151] been stabilized after their index MI  [18]. The rationale for the 
exclusion of elderly patients (aged >75 years) and patients with a low body weight (<60 kg) is that 
prasugrel is generally not recommended  in these patient populations  [1,2] . 
The study will be performed at the University of Flori da Health Science Center at UF Health 
Jacksonville - Division of Cardiology. Patients will be recruited in the Cardiology Clinics of our 
institution and will be screened by [CONTACT_8288], who will verify that all candidates 
meet inclusion and e xclusion criteria. Results from blood tests performed within the last 90 days 
will be considered valid for screening purposes. If these are not available, a blood sample will be 
collected for the screening phase.  Although the study has an open -label design , laboratory personnel 
performing PD testing will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
Patients on DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458135]/ ticagrelor as part of their standard of care  for at 
least 2 weeks and who are meeting study entry criteria will be randomly as signed in a 1:1:1 fashion 
to one of the following 3 treatment regimens: 1) DAPT (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458135]/ticagrelor) plus 
Protocol version:  June 30, 2018  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
10 
 vorapaxar 2.5mg od; 2) prasugrel/ticagrelor plus vorapaxar 2.5mg od; 3) continue DAPT with 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458135]/ticagrelor. Randomized treatment will be administered for 30 ± 3  days; 
prasugrel and ticagrelor will be administered at their standard maintenance dose (10mg od and 
90mg bid, respectively).  Randomization will be stratified according to type of P2Y [ADDRESS_585152] 35% of patients on prasugrel. The rationale for predicting a higher number 
of randomized patients on ticagrelor derives from the more broad clinical indications of ticagrelor 
compared with prasugrel.  Patient who entered the study before being on  DAPT for 2 weeks will be 
required to complete 2 weeks of DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458135]/ticagrelor before randomization.  
Blood sampling for PD testing will be conducted at 3 time-points: a) baseline (while patients 
will be on standard DAPT prior to initi ating randomized treatment);  b) after 7 -10 days of 
randomized study treatment; c) after 30 ± 3days of randomized study treatment . At each time point, 
blood will be collected before the morning dose of prasugrel/ticagrelor and vorapaxar, in order to 
measure  trough levels of platelet inhibition. During study treatment in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_458136] (death, MI, stroke, and urgent revascularization proce dures) and serious adverse 
events (bleeding and other adverse events) will be collected. Bleeding will be defined by [CONTACT_458147] 
(Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) definition  [19]. 
After study completion, patients will resume antiplatelet treatment regimen at the discretion 
of the treating physic ian. A flow diagram of the study design is illustrated below.

Laboratory assessments  
Peripheral venous blood samples (20 mL) will be drawn through a short venous catheter 
inserted into a forearm vein and collected in citrate, EDTA, and serum tubes as appropriate for 
assessmen ts. The first 2 -4 mL of blood will be discarded to avoid spontaneous platelet activation. 
Blood sampling for PD will be performed at 3 time points as indicated above in the study design 
section. Various PD assays will be performed as described below. Given  the potential interplay 
between PAR -1 and P2Y 12 mediated signaling, assessments specific for both pathways will be 
conducted  [11]:

 1. Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA)  
2. Thrombelastograph Coagulation Analyzer TEG 6s Series system  (CORA® system)  
3. Whole bloo d vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)  
4. Serum thromboxane B2  
 
Description of laboratory assays  
1) Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA):  Platelet aggregation will be performed using LTA 
according to standard protocols. Blood will be collected in ci trated (3.8%) tubes. LTA will be 
assessed using platelet rich plasma (PRP) by [CONTACT_8294] a 2 -channel aggregometer 
(Chrono -Log 490 Model, Chrono -Log Corp., Havertown) as previously described [ 20,21 ]. Platelet 
agonists will include AA (1 mM) , collagen (3µg/ml), ADP (5 and 20 µM), TRAP (15 μM), and a 
combination of 2 µg/ml collagen -related peptide + 5 µM ADP + 15 µM TRAP (CAT). The reagent 
cocktail CAT will allow to assess the overall platelet response to a combination of agonists that 
leads t o activation of multiple platelet pathways. PRP will be obtained as a supernatant after 
centrifugation of citrated blood at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. The isolated PRP will be kept at 37° C 
before use. Platelet poor plasma (PPP) will be obtained by a second centrifugation of the blood 
fraction at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes. Light transmission will be adjusted to 0% with the PRP and to 
100% for the PPP for each measurement. Curves will be recorded for 6 minutes and platelet 
aggregation will be determined as the m aximal percent change (MPA) in light transmittance from 
baseline using PPP as a reference.  
2) TEG 6s Series system (CORA® system) : the TEG 6s system (Haemonetics Corporation, 
Braintree, MA, [LOCATION_003]) will be used according to manufacture instructions  [22]. In b rief, the CORA® 
Protocol version:  June 30, 2018  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
[ADDRESS_585153] received platelet inhibiting drugs. The 
PlateletMappi[INVESTIGATOR_8264] a set of agonists, ADP and arachidonic acid ( AA) platelet 
agonists together with Act ivatorF, which can measure the inhibition of platelet function. This assay 
specifically determines the MA (Maximum Amplitude, a measure of clot strength) and the 
reduction in MA due to antiplatelet therapy and reports it as a percentage of reduction in clo t 
strength. The assay uses AA and ADP agonists to generate test results that reflect the inhibiting 
effects of antiplatelet agents such as TxA2 Inhibitors (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) and ADP P2Y 12 inhibitors (e.g., 
ticagrelor). Since thrombin (present in blood samples ) is the primary and most potent activator of 
platelets, its activity must be inhibited with heparin so that the platelet activating effects of ADP and 
Protocol version:  June 30, 2018  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
[ADDRESS_585154] thrombin’s role in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa. 
Thus, with this cross -linked fibrin network as the foundation, additional clot strength due to 
platelet -fibrin bonding related to ADP and AA platelet receptor activa tion can be measured. The 
HKH reagent , a combination of kaolin and heparinase, generates test data for the uninhibited MA 
resulting from thrombin activation of the blood sample, while the heparinase neutralizes the effects 
of heparin. The HKH test provides  measures of R (Reaction time; the amount of time between the 
start of the test and the beginning of coagulation), K (the speed of formation of the clot from R time 
to a specific clot strength), Angle (the speed of clot strengthening), LY30 (Percent lysis 30 minutes 
after MA is finalized) and MA parameters; The activatorF test provides the contribution of fibrin to 
the overall strength of the clot.  This test value is used in the calculation of aggregation/inhibition 
for MA ADP and MA AA. T he AA and ADP tes t provide measures of MA, percent inhibition and 
percent aggregation.  
3) Whole blood vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) : VASP phosphorylation (VASP -P) 
is a marker of P2Y [ADDRESS_585155] protocol 
using labeled monoclonal antibodies by [CONTACT_458148] -FCM kit (Biocytex 
Inc., Marseille, [LOCATION_009]) as previously described [23]. PGE1 increases VASP -P levels by [CONTACT_458149]. Binding of ADP to P2Y12 leads to Gi -coup led inhibition of adenylate cyclase. 
Therefore, the addition of ADP to PGE1 -stimulated platelets reduces PGE1 -induced VASP -P 
levels. If P2Y12 receptors are successfully inhibited by [CONTACT_8292], addition of ADP will not reduce 
the PGE1 -stimulated VASP -P lev els. The platelet reactivity ratio (PRI) will be calculated after 
measuring VASP -P levels after stimulation with PGE1 (MFI PGE1) and also PGE1 + ADP (MFI 
Protocol version:  June 30, 2018  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
15 
 PGE1 + ADP). The P2Y12 reactivity ratio = ([MFI PGE1] – [MFI PGE1 + ADP]/[MFI PGE1]) x 
100%.  
4) Serum thromboxane B2 : The concentration of serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) will be measured 
by [CONTACT_8296]2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the 
instructions of the manufacturer, as previously described [24]. Briefly, samples will be d iluted with 
EIA buffer to bring their concentrations within the range of the standard curve. No other 
purification will be performed on any of the samples. A standard curve will be established by [CONTACT_458150]2 between 1000 pg/mL and 7.8 pg/mL usi ng EIA buffer as the matrix. The 
concentration of TXB2 in the samples will be calculated from a logistic [ADDRESS_585156] concentrations versus percentage bound/maximum bound.  
 
Study endpoints and sample size calculation  
The primary end poin t of our study is the comparison of CAT -induced MPA between DAPT 
and DAPT plus vorapaxar after 30 ± 3 days of treatment. We hypothesize that adjunctive vorapaxar 
will result into a significant reduction of platelet aggregation. Assuming a 10% absolute redu ction 
in CAT -induced MPA with a common standard deviation of 13%, [ADDRESS_585157] a significant difference between DAPT and DAPT plus vorapaxar with a 90% 
power and 2 -sided alpha=0.05. Considering a possible 30-35% rate of in valid results due to 
hemolysis or drop -out and the three arms of treatment up to 146  patients will need to be 
randomized. Since there are no preliminary data in this particular setting, the sample size of our 
study was calculated based on previous data of vorapaxar in addition to DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458137] [ 21]. This approach is in agreement with recommendations for pi[INVESTIGATOR_8265] [2 5]. 
Protocol version:  June 30, 2018  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
16 
 Our secondary outcome will be the comparison of CAT -induced MPA between vorapaxar in 
addition to a new genera tion P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor) and vorapaxar in 
addition to standard DAPT (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_458135]/ticagrelor) . We hypothesize that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_458138] -induced MPA  after 30 ± 3 days of tre atment.  
Other objectives will include the comparisons among the 3 groups of all PD parameters 
measured by [CONTACT_458151] , as well as intragroup comparisons of PD 
parameters in order to evaluate the variability over time of vorapaxar PD  effects , as well as how PD 
measures will be affected by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_458139] .  
 
Statistical analysis plan  
Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be presented as mean ± SD  or median [IQR] . Continuou s variables will be analyzed 
for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. Comparisons between categorical 
variables will be performed using two -tailed Fisher’s exact test or the Pearson's chi -square test. 
Student´s t test, Mann -Whitney U -test and Wilcoxon test will be used to compare continuous 
variables when appropriate.  An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method with a general linear 
model, using baseline variables significantly different between groups as covariates, will be used to 
evaluate the overall difference between groups and all between -groups comparisons, in line with 
other PD studies [23]. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to evaluate intragroup 
comparisons.  A 2-tailed p value of < 0.05 is considered to indicate a statistical ly significant 
difference for all the analyses performed. Statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_458152] v22.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).

Publication Strategy/Additional Information   
Study subjects will be identified first (months 1-24): we expect to enroll approximately 5-6 
subjects monthly and complete enrollment in 24 months (total: 126 subjects enrolled). Months [ADDRESS_585158] prospective study and is based on well -established methods. However, since there is limited 
exper ience with vorapaxar to define platelet function, variability may be higher than expected and 
we cannot currently perform a detailed sample size calculation. We anticipate adding this to the 
protocol after inclusion of the study population has been complet ed. If the sample size after one 
year is estimated to be too small, additional patients will be included. This approach is in agreement 
with recommendations for pi[INVESTIGATOR_8265] [25]. 
 
Possible Discomforts and Risk  
In clinical trials, the most common c linical side effects of vorapaxar were anemia  (5%) , 
depression  (2.4%)  and rash  (2.2%)  [14, 18 ]. The most important adverse effect associated with the 
use of vorapaxar is bleeding. The risk of TIMI clinically significant  bleeding with vorapaxar  is 
15.8% and 11.1% with placebo (HR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.36 -1.57, p<0.001) ; the risk of TIMI non -
CABG -related major bleeding with vorapaxar is 2.8% and 1.8 % with placebo (HR 1.46; 95% CI, 
1.22-1.75, p<0.001) ; the risk of intracranial bleeding (intracerebral, subdural or ep idural) with 
vorapaxar is 1% vs 0.5% with placebo (HR 1.94; 95% CI 1.39 -2.70; p <0.001)  [14]. However, such

 bleeding prevalence occurred in the setting of long -term ( 3 years ) trial, while our study is limited to 
only approximately [ADDRESS_585159] also excluded from the study patients at 
increased risk of bleeding complications  [12-14]. Moreover, the use of vorap axar in this study is 
limited to the intended for use population at low risk of bleeding.  All clinical events described 
above,  if they were to occur, as well as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and urgent 
revascularization procedure with PCI or coronary artery by[CONTACT_458153]. Bleeding 
data will be collected using BARC  definitions [20]. Clinical events will be evaluated by a local 
committee, comprised of 2 faculty members (2 cardiologists), not directly involved in the research. 
In the event of a report of a serious adverse event (major bleeding – defined as life -threatening: 
fatal, symptomatic intracranial h emorrhage, leading to a drop in hemoglobin of at least 5 g/dL, 
significant hypotension requiring intravenous inotropes, requiring surgical intervention, or requiring 
transfusion of 4 or more units of blood; non –life-threatening: substantially disabling, in traocular 
bleeding leading to vision loss, or requiring at least 2 units of blood; thrombocytopenia <50,000 ) 
the local committee will meet and antiplatelet treatment management will be managed according to 
physician recommendation.  
 
Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any unintended or undesirable experience that occurs during the course 
of the clinical investigation whether or not it is considered to be therapy related.  This includes any 
newly occurring event or previous condition that has i ncreased in severity or frequency since the 
initiation of study treatment.  Adverse events will be followed until resolution while the patient 
Protocol version:  June 30, 2018  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
19 
 remains on -study.  Once the patient is removed from study, events thought to be related to the study 
therapy will  be followed until resolution or until the patient starts a new treatment regimen.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE): An adverse event occurring while on study and considered 
related (reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused the adverse experience ) to the study 
treatment that results in any of the following outcomes:  
- Death  
- A life -threatening adverse experience.  
- A persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or is  a congenital anomaly, or birth  
defect.  
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
The definition of serious adverse event also includes ‘important medical event’.  Medical 
and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate 
in other situations , such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8266]/or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the defi nition above.  These 
should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or developmen t of drug dependency or drug abuse.

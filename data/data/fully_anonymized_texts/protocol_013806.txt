A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial on Safety and Efficacy of 
Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma for Treatment of Erectile Function
2. Background
2.1 Platelet-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_821169]-derived therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22920] a growing trend across multiple medical and surgical 
specialties including dermatology, ophthalmology, cardiology, colorectal surgery, plastic 
surgery and mainly orthopedics [1-2]. One of the most well described platelet-based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_821170]-rich plasma (PRP) [3]. PRP is derived from the 
centrifugation of whole blood with a separator gel to remove the red and white blood cells. 
The resulting supernatant has a greater than four-fold increase in platelets and other 
plasma proteins [1]. This concentrate is then administered via injection. PRP has been 
frequently used for orthopedic conditions such as bone and soft tissue trauma, 
inflammatory conditions, and chronic pain syndromes [3-4]. Evidence suggests that 
platelets play an important role not only in coagulation but also in regulation of body 
metabolism, promotion of the wound healing, tissue regeneration, vascular remodeling 
and inflammatory/immune responses through secretion of growth factors, cytokines and 
chemokines [4-5]. These biologically active proteins include transforming growth factor-
β, platelet-derived growth factor, platelet-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_66512], insulin- like 
growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, as well as 
many others [6]. When platelets are activated, they release these growth differentiation 
factors, facilitating even nerve repair and regeneration [7-8]. Growth factors act locally 
and are implicated in many aspects of natural wound healing, including chemotaxis, cell 
proliferation, cell differentiation and angiogenesis. They also control and conduct 
synthesis, modification and degeneration of extracellular matrix proteins. Coordination of 
these cellular and molecular processes is integral to proper wound healing and tissue 
regeneration [9]. The key role of platelets in these processes makes them an attractive 
candidate for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_821171], as well as tissue 
regeneration.
Autologous blood-based biomaterials are promising therapeutic options for varied 
pathology. Rapid generation of therapeutic material following collection allows for point-
of- care therapy [10]. Furthermore, an autologous therapy avoids the need for 
immunosuppression and eliminates concerns of rejection. Newer strategies to prolong 
the anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties of platelets have focused on creating 
a fibrin matrix (platelet rich fibrin matrix, PRFM) to bind the platelets and prevent 
extravasation from the site of injection, thereby [CONTACT_821179] [11]. In addition, PRFM offers a potential scaffold for tissue ingrowth and may 
allow continued release of platelet-related factors for a longer duration. Across multiple 
disciplines, PRP has been used both as a primary treatment modality and as a 
supplement to other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_821172], tissue 
regeneration, and angiogenesis. Although most of the studies focusing on PRP injections 
have been relatively small and heterogenous, they largely support the concept of 
administration in terms of safety, while efficacy remains uncertain. Finally, the concept of

Protocol Version: 1.3 Version Date: 23 JAN 2023 Page 8 of 23autologous therapy has be shown in the real world that it is particularly attractive to 
patients [10].
2.2 Platelet-rich plasma treatment for erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects as many as 1 in 4 men, and evidence indicates that 
incidence is rising [12-13]. The pathophysiology is multifactorial, but the most common 
pathophysiology, vasculogenic erectile dysfunction, has as first sign endothelial 
dysfunction secondary to inflammation [14]. The most common treatments for ED aim to 
improve endothelial function through augmentation of the nitric oxide pathway [15]. 
Return of potency after surgical injury of CNS partially depends on axon regeneration in 
the remaining neural tissue [16]. The process of regeneration and functional recovery of 
peripheral nerve is slow and is influenced by [CONTACT_537695] [17] such as extracellular 
matrix, neurotrophic factors, and cellular components [18]. Recent advances in the 
understanding of molecular pathways and their physiological role demonstrate that 
growth factors are an important part of the development, maintenance, and regeneration 
of the nervous system [19]. Various growth factor neuromodulatory strategies, including 
insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and neurotrophic factors, are investigated to identify 
agents that may have neuroprotective and regenerative function after the occurrence of 
peripheral nerve injury. Accumulating evidence indicates that neuroimmunophilin ligand 
(such as FK506) plays a significant role in neural regeneration and upregulation of 
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), as well as in the recovery of erectile function after 
CN injury occurrence [20-21]. FK506 neuroprotection after CN injury is mediated by 
[CONTACT_821180]/nitrosative and anti- apoptotic pathway [22]. When platelets are activated, 
they release many kinds of growth differentiation factors and a few types have been found 
to facilitate nerve repair and regeneration. Moreover, corporeal dysfunction due to smooth 
muscle atrophy or other inracavernosal pathology can lead to corporo-venous occlusive 
erectile dysfunction despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a normal arterial inflow. Rejuvenating the Corporeal tissues 
with PRP, which is well known for its growth and healing factors, is a possible modality 
as a potential treatment for erectile dysfunction according to Alkhayal et al [23]. In their 
retrospective study examining the efficacy of one intra-cavernosal PRP injection to 40 ED 
patients, they reported that mean IIEF-5 score before treatment was 13 (5-20) and post 
treatment IIEF-5 = 17 (7-24), (p < 0.001). Other studies have shown similar results with 
minimal side effects, no serious adverse reactions and potential efficacy (Table 1) [23-
26].

To date, there are no treatments that address the underlying cause of endothelial 
dysfunction, although LIST treatment for ED has shown promising results. Platelet-
derived therapi[INVESTIGATOR_821173]/nerve regeneration and 
may represent a potential treatment option towards this direction. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_821174], no randomized placebo-controlled studies exist.

initiation, however each of these recruitment methods will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_70647].
Pre-screening of subjects includes reviewing medical records and imaging studies for 
inclusion/exclusions prior to consent. From the review of subjects’ medical records and 
imaging studies on file, subjects who are determined to have a diagnosis of erectile 
dysfunction of organic origin, and have mild-moderate erectile function as assessed by 
[CONTACT_612246]-EF, as stated in Section 6.1, and also do not have evidence in their medical record 
of study exclusions stated in Section 6.2, are eligible to be consented to the study.
Investigators will inform research staff of potential participants who have been identified 
through pre-screening so the subjects can be approached to discuss the study and 
conduct the informed consent session. No study procedures will take place prior to the 
subjects signing of the informed consent form.

form (ICF) will be given to each subject. The ICF will contain all [LOCATION_002] federally 
required elements, all International Conference of Harmonization of Technical 
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) required 
elements, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Authorization (HIPAA) 
information in language that is understandable to the subject. The informed consent 
includes descriptions of all study related procedures, all possible risks to participant, and 
the time commitment involved with participating. All consent forms will have IRB approval. 
The ICF and review must be in a form understandable to the subject. Translation of ICFs 
will be done in accordance with local IRB procedures.
Potential participants will be approached by [CONTACT_821182]. Information regarding study participation will be provided to the potential 
participant prior to consent. Subjects will be given ample time to review the ICF and ask 
questions before signing. The Investigator or designee and the subject must both sign 
and date the ICF after review, and before the any study procedures are performed. The 
subject will receive a copy of the signed and dated form, and the original will be retained 
in the site study files. The research staff member obtaining consent will document the 
informed process in the subject’s chart for monitoring purposes. The Investigator or 
his/her designee must emphasize to the subject that study participation is entirely 
voluntary and that consent regarding study participation may be withdrawn at any time 
without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.

and sexual history, as well as necessary lab tests (testosterone, prolactin, hematology, 
chemistry), if not available during the last [ADDRESS_1138541] injection. Refer to table 1 for 
procedures to be performed at the Screening visit.
8.3.2 Visit 2-3: Injection Visits (Day 0 & Day 28)
All participants will complete the IIEF questionnaire, and SEP diaries will be evaluated. 
Upon evaluation of eligibility, subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 parallel study 
groups, using an online program, and initiate treatment on the same day. 
There will be 2 treatment visits for all Groups with 28 ± 7 days treatment interval for all 
subjects. Subjects will complete a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score after the end 
of each treatment. Refer to table 1 for all procedures to be performed at the Intervention 
Visits.
8.3.3 Visit 4-6: Follow Up Visits (Week 4, 12, 24) Post-Injection
Follow up visits will occur within 30 ± 7 days of final injection (V3). Refer to table [ADDRESS_1138542]
9.1 Preparation of IP
Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is prepared by [CONTACT_41680] 120 mL aliquots of 
anticoagulated blood (120 mL whole blood and 16 ml anticoagulant citrate dextrose 
formula A) obtained from each treatment subject by [CONTACT_48571]. Each aliquot is 
processed by [CONTACT_821183] (Arthrex Angel, Arthrex Inc., Naples, 
[LOCATION_012]) to yield 3-[ADDRESS_1138543]. Platelet poor plasma (PPP) can be 
added to PRP to achieve the desired injection volume. This system is FDA approved by 
501k for “clinical laboratory or intraoperatively at the point of care for the safe and rapid 
preparation of platelet poor plasma and platelet concentrate (platelet rich plasma) from a 
small sample of whole blood or a small mixture of blood and bone marrow”. For patients 
randomized to the control arm, they will still have their blood drawn, however it will not be 
processed to make PRP.
9.2 Administration of IP
The patient will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. A sterile field will be developed with Betadine prep 
of the genitalia, sterile gloves and a sterile extremity drape. A total of 20 ml of 1% lidocaine 
will be drawn up using an 18-gauge needle and will be subcutaneously administered 
using a 27-gauge needle into the subcutaneous tissue at the base of the penis to obtain 
a dorsal nerve block. A 1/4-inch Penrose drain will be used as a tourniquet by [CONTACT_821184] a sterile clamp. A 
maximum of 5mL  of PRP will be infused steadily over a two-minute period – 
approximately 2.5 ml each into the right and left corpus cavernosum. The infusion will be 
performed at this slow speed (each side over 2 minutes of infusion) to minimize injury to

10.Data Management
Data will be entered from source documents into eCRFs which are maintained in an online 
research database. The investigator will ensure data integrity by [CONTACT_821186]’s 
are attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete.
10.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs)
The Investigator or designee must record all required subject data, and an explanation 
must be documented for any missing data. This study will use electronic case report forms 
(eCRF) for data entry and database storage.
10.2 Source Documents
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. 
Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, 
and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_16213], and records kept at medical technical departments involved in the clinical trial.

12.1 Adverse Events (AEs)
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study. The 
event does not need to have a causal relationship with treatment. 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5 
(CTCAE) will be used for describing AEs. All urological and/or 
reproductive system AEs will be recorded. For all other AEs, only 
events greater than grade 2 will be recorded.
We anticipate there to be few adverse events related to the study. 
Based on the four published studies and abstracts, including 75 
men, only minor adverse events were reported (Bruising 1, Mild 
Pain 4). No serious adverse events were observed [23-26] (Table 2)
12.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE which, in the view of the Investigator 
results in: 1) Death; 2) a life-threatening event (i.e. an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe); 3) inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] > 24 hours 
or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 4) a significant disability/incapacity; or 5) a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Other important medical events may be considered 
SAEs if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], they jeopardize the subject or require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Based on prior 
investigations, we do not anticipate any SAEs related to the study procedures [23-26]
Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TE-SAEs) 
A treatment emergent serious adverse event (TE-SAE) is defined as any serious adverse 
event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused 
the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, “a reasonable possibility” means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product/procedures 
and the adverse event.

a surgeon monitor ([CONTACT_821199]) who is not directly involved in the study, and 
has been delegated by [CONTACT_821189]. The 
investigators will conduct continuous reviews of the safety data, keep track of SAEs and 
TE-SAEs, which will be discussed at research committee meetings once every 3 months.

committee meetings. In addition, all SAEs will be entered into research database and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_821190]. If a death occurs within 30 days 
of investigational therapy, and is determined to be related to the study, the investigators 
will notify the Urology Department Chair ([CONTACT_98823]) within 1 business day. If an 
increase in the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events is noted in the study, a report 
will be submitted to the Department Chair at the time the increased rate is identified. If at 
any time the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_821178], the Department Chair will be notified within 1 business day and a formal letter will 
be sent to the Department Chair to be received within 10 business days.
13.  Statistical Considerations
13.1 Data Analysis Plan
Analysis plan: Continuous data will be analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measures, 
or student’s T-Test (where applicable) in order to compare differences between the 
treatment and control groups. For categorical data, Fisher’s Exact test to determine 
differences between groups. Statistical significance will be evaluated using α=0.05. 
13.2 Sample Size
Inclusion Criteria are men with IIEF scores >11 which includes men with mild (IIEF 16-
21) and mild/moderate (12-16) Erectile dysfunction. Minimal clinically important 
differenced (MCID) for these groups are an increase of [ADDRESS_1138549] of placebo show about a 15% improvement in men with 
mild to moderate ED. Therefore, 15% of the placebo group is expected to meet MCID. 
Results from the PRP safety study by [CONTACT_821191]. 2018, which showed a mean 
improvement in IIEF of 4.[ADDRESS_1138550] 50% to meet MCID. At 80% power, we will therefore need 
[ADDRESS_1138551] a difference of 35% between treatment and placebo 
arms.
28.08 = (2*(1.96+0.84)2 * (0.25*(1-0.25)) / (0.352)
Assuming attrition of approximately 20%, an additional 6 participant slots will be added 
to each group for a total sample size of 80 subjects.
14.  Risks to Subjects
We anticipate there to be few adverse events related to the study. Based on the four 
published studies and abstracts, including 75 men, only minor adverse events were 
reported (Bruising 1, Mild Pain 4). No serious adverse events were observed [23-26] 
(Table 2). After literature review, we believe this product to be of non-significant risk to 
patients (NSR) and for investigational use in a clinical study protocol. 
Based on published studies, we will record anticipated adverse events to patients include: 
local injection cite reaction, penile plain and penile bruising. Additionally, we anticipate

reported in previous studies) and will record them at every visit systematically.
15.  Potential Benefits to Subjects
The potential benefits for men randomized to the treatment arm will include improvement 
in erectile function and sexual performance.
16.  Privacy & Confidentiality
Each subject’s protected health information will remain strictly confidential and shall be 
excluded from the database. Patients deemed eligible to participate in the study following 
evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a unique study participant 
identifier number (ex.: 01-PRP01-001). The first two characters indicate the enrolling site, 
next 5 characters describe the study and phase, and final 3 characters are the unique 
identification number assigned to subjects in sequential order. Only each participant’s 
initials, assigned study participant identifier number, and date of birth may be documented 
in the database. The Investigator will retain a cross-referencing record of each subject’s 
name [CONTACT_821198]. All study data and results will be stored in the 
electronic database. Each study subject will give explicit consent for representatives of 
the IRB/IEC and regulatory authorities to inspect and verify each subject’s medical 
records and collected information. In turn, each study subject will be assured that all their 
personal information will be maintained in the strictest of confidence, and in compliance 
with HIPAA, and all other federal and local laws regulating privacy and data protection.
17.  Ethical Considerations
17.1    Regulatory Authority Approval
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
requirements described in the current revision of International Conference on 
Harmonization of Technical Requirements of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) 
Guidelines and all applicable regulations, including current [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), Title 21, Parts 50, 54, 56, and Title 45, Part 164. Compliance with 
these regulations and guidelines also constitutes compliance with the ethical principles 
described in the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki.  This study will also be 
carried out in accordance with local legal requirements. 
According to FDA guidance issued to institutional review boards and investigators, we will 
use PRP for ED (an indication not approved on the labeling) while simultaneously 
“bearing the responsibility to be well informed about the product,  base its use on firm 
scientific rationale and on sound medical evidence, and to maintain records of the 
product’s use and effects.”
We believe that according FDA regulation, the clinical investigation of PRP for ED does 
not require submission of an IND / IDE since all six of the following conditions are met:
i. it is not intended to be reported to FDA in support of a new indication for use or to 
support any other significant change in the labeling for the drug;
ii. it is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product;

population, or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the 
acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product;
iv. it is conducted in compliance with the requirements for IRB review and informed 
consent [21 CFR parts 56 and 50, respectively];
v. it is conducted in compliance with the requirements concerning the promotion and 
sale of drugs [21 CFR 312.7]; and
vi. it does not intend to invoke [ADDRESS_1138553] the study in compliance with the protocol, current good 
clinical practices, and all applicable (local, FDA) regulatory guidelines and standard of 
ethics.
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that, prior to initiating this study, this protocol 
is reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_821192]/or external IRB.  The composition 
and conduct of this committee must conform to the [LOCATION_002] CFR. The IRB/IEC must 
also review and approve the site’s informed consent form (ICF), other written information 
provided to the subject.
If it is necessary to amend the protocol or the ICF during the study, the Sponsor-
Investigator will be responsible for ensuring that the IRB/IEC reviews and approves these 
amended documents. An IRB/IEC approval of the amended protocol and/or ICF must be 
obtained in writing before implementation of the amended procedures and before new 
subjects are consented to participate in the study using the amended version of the ICF.

Investigation Purpose  Post -market clinical follow -up for continued assessment of safety and 
performance of the InterStim basic evaluation lead  and foramen 
needle (s) used during a therapy evaluation.  
Intended Study Population  The study will enroll patients with overacti ve bladder.  All subjects 
implanted must be candidates for sacral neuromodulation.  
Primary Objective  To characterize proportion of subjects who demonstrate motor or 
sensory response(s) during lead placement using the InterStim Basic 
Evaluation Lead.  
  
  
 
   
 
 
Safety Assessment  To characterize safety during the basic evaluation lead implant and 
therapy evaluation.  
 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_731405]. Any adverse eve nt meeting the definition of: serious, device 
related, therapy related and/or procedure related will be considered 
reportable for this study.  
 
Device deficiencies will be collected and reported.  
Study Design  This is a prospective, multicenter, post market clinical follow -up study 
to characterize the clinical performance and safety of the InterStim 
basic evaluation lead with the commercially -approved foramen 
needle and b asic evaluation kit. The study is intended to be 
conducted at approximately [ADDRESS_1207191]- Market Clinical       
Follow -up (PMCF) Clinical Investigation Plan  
  
MDT19002 Version  1.[ADDRESS_1207192] is approximately three weeks , 
depending on when the basic evaluation  lead implant procedure is 
scheduled . 
Sample Size  Subjects will be enrolled to obtain a sample size of approximately 100 
subjects who complete a basic evaluation with motor or sensory 
threshold testing to confirm clinical performance.  The sample size of 
approximately 100 subjects is driven to obtain preci sion of the 
primary endpoint.  
 
Assuming that motor or sensory response is able to be obtained in 95% of subjects during the basic evaluation lead placement, with 100 subjects, this produces a two -sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI ) of

  4. Introduction  
4.1. Background  
Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM) delivered by [CONTACT_865379] a guideline 
recommended advanced therapy option for the treatment of overactive bladder.1,2 Prior to receiving an 
implanted system for chronic therapy, a patient can undergo a therapy evaluation  in order to assess 
response to the therapy.  A therapy evaluation can be conducted  with either a temporary  trialing lead, 
connected to  an external neurostimulator  for a temporary trial  (also known as the basic evaluation)  or a 
chronic lead  can be used with the same external neurostimulator for a longer duration trial , known as an 
advanced evaluation .  Both approaches are designed to deliver stimulation  to the sacral nerves  in order 
to assess whether the patient responds to therapy, thus allowing patients  the ability to  “test drive” SNM 
prior to committing to an implanted system.  This protocol uses  the term basic evaluation to indicate the 
therapy evaluation period .   
The predicate temporary trialing lead  obtained CE mark in 199 8, was approved by [CONTACT_13229] 1998 and was 
licensed by [CONTACT_865380] 1999 . Since that time, this lead has consistently been used for Medtronic’s 
basic evaluations as this is the only temporary trialing lead that is market release d for the InterStim  
system .  Safety  and performance have  been reported in the literature  for many years3-10, along with 
twenty years of clinical experience tracked in Medtronic’s post-market surveillance reporting  system .   
Temporary  trialing leads are intended to deliver temporary sacral neuromodulation for the duration of 
the therapy evaluation period.  Sacral nerves are mixed nerves containing both motor and sensory 
fibers. In order to ensure appropriate lead placement , motor and/or sensory responses such as bellows, 
movement of the perineum, plantar flexion of the great toe or sensation in the rectum, scrotum or 
vagina11 are assessed during the temporary trialing lead  implant . The temporary trialing  lead, now 
referred to as basic evaluation (BE) lead,  foramen needles and procedure kit have been updated and the 
aim of this study  is to evaluate the performance and safety of the recently market -released InterStim BE 
lead, foramen needles and BE kit  (includes the updated lead and foramen needles). See Table [ADDRESS_1207197]- Market Clinical

  5. Objectives  
5.1. Objectives  
5.1.1.  Primary Objective  
To characterize  the proportion of subjects who demonstrate motor or sensory response(s) during lead 
placement using the InterStim basic evaluation lead. 
   
  
  
  
   
  
5.1.3.  Safety Assessment  
To characterize safety during the basic evaluation lead implant and therapy evaluation.  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_731405]. Any adverse event meeting the 
definition of: serious, device related, therapy related and/or procedure related will be considered 
reportable for this study.  
Device deficiencies will be collected and reported.  
6. Study Design  
This is a prospective, multicenter,  global , post market clinical follow -up study to characterize the clinical 
performance and safety of the InterStim basic evaluation lead with the commercially -approved foramen 
needle and b asic evaluation kit.   Commercial devices will be used within their intended  use as described 
in approved instructions for use for which approval  has been obtained . 
Eligible subjects,  who are already candidates for sacral neuromodulation, will sign a study -specific 
informed consent form (ICF).  All eligible subjects will complete baseline procedures, including a urinary voiding diary and assessment of medical history, prior to the BE  lead implant  procedure.   Subjects will 
be considered enrolled at the time of  the BE lead procedure.  During the BE lead implant procedure, a n 
assessment of motor or sensory response will be completed.  Subjects will be discharged for the t herapy 
evaluation  and instructed to start completing a daily urinary voiding diary.  Subjects will return for a 1-

Following the BE lead implant, subjects will be required to return for the  1-week follow-up visit (no later 
than 7 days following the lead implant procedure).   
The estimated study duration, from first subject enrollment to last subject visit, is expected to last 
approximately [ADDRESS_1207199]- Market Clinical

  9.3. Concomitant Medications  
OAB medication use will not be restricted during the trial; ho wever, all OAB medication will be collected 
on a study -specific medication log.  
9.4. Subject Consent  
The informed consent process will be performed in accordance with the ethical principles that have  
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, 21CFR§50 Protec tion of Human Subjects (US only), SOR/98 - 
282 (Canada only) and in accordance with local regulatory requirements. No vulnerable patients will be  
allowed to be consented to participate in the study. Data will be collected and treated in accordance  
with appl icable Data Privacy Legislation. With regard to the EU this includes Directive 95/46/EC and  
subsequent legislation.  
Prior to entering the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_865365], procedures, expected study duration, available alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the benefits and risks involved with study participation and the potential treatment. The  
person obtaining consent will avoid any coercion or undue improper influence on, or inducement of, the  
subject to participate and the ICF will not waive, or appear to waive, any legal rights. Subjects will be  
given a copy of the IRB/EC approved ICF and will have ample time to review the document and to ask  
questions and will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice;  
ICFs will be provided in a language understandable to the subject. After this explanation and before any  
study -specific procedures have been performed, the subject will voluntarily sig n and personally date the 
ICF. Prior to participation in the study, the subject will receive a copy of the signed and dated written  
informed consent and any other written information provided to the subject.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_550434] (delegat ed) designee will document the informed consent  
process, including the date of consent and name [CONTACT_865404]’s medical record. A copy of the signed ICF will also be placed in the subject’s medical record.  
Thro ughout study participation, any significant new information will be provided to the subject as  
outlined in the informed consent form. As appropriate, the ICF may be revised based on new  
information that becomes available.  
9.5. Assessment of Efficacy   
Motor and sensory response 
A motor or sensory response will be determined at the time of lead placement with the foramen needle 
and confirmed with the BE  lead.   Amplitude will be titrated up from 0 until a response is reported 
and/or observed.  A s ensory response is defined as the lowest amplitude where the subject first 
perceives sensation of the stimulation.  A motor response is defined as the lowest amplitude of 
electrical stimulation where a motor response (e.g. bellows response, anal wink and/o r plantar flexion of 
the big toe) is observed.

  Urinary Voiding  Diary  
Symptoms related to OAB will be evaluated using paper voiding diaries. Subjects will be trained to  
complete the urinary voiding diaries for 3 -days as part of the baseline procedures. The urinary voiding 
diaries will be completed daily following the BE  lead implant until the 1-week follow -up visit.  Every 
effort should be made to remind subjects of the importance of real -time  diary  completion.  
 
Diaries will be used for comparison from the 1-w eek follow-up visit to baseline for the additional study 
measure of characterizing changes in bladder symptoms . 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
9.6. Assessment of Safety  
All reportable adverse events (see Section 11.1) and device deficiencies will be collected throughout the 
study once the informed consent form is signed.  
9.7. Recording Data  
This study will be conducted using a remote data capture system. The Oracle Clinical Remote Data  
Capture (RDC) system which allows the study centers to enter study data into the sponsor’s database  
over a secure internet connection, will be used to capture study required Case Report Form (CRF)  
information. Data reported on urinary voiding diaries and subject questionnaire will be entered to the  
database by [CONTACT_330932]. Subjects will complete the study questionnaire confidentially on paper  
forms without site personnel consultation and these data will be entered to OC/RDC by [CONTACT_8786].

  Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be provided by [CONTACT_456]; required data will be taken from source  
documents and directly entered into the study database via the CRFs by [CONTACT_14523], in  
accordance with applicable regulations.  
 
Device interrogation (programming) data may be transmitted using either Medtronic’s programming upload system  or by [CONTACT_865382] a programming CRF.  
 Urinary voiding diaries  are to be completed only by [CONTACT_423]. Representatives 
from the research site may not make entries to the diaries  except for  
data fields confirmed by [CONTACT_865383].   
 
The Principal Investigator, Sub -Investigator, or an individual delegated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_865366], are responsible for documenting and enterin g data for  
the study on the eCRFs. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator is required to approve all data on  
CRFs via electronic signature. 
9.8. Deviation Handling  
Protocol deviations are digressions from the written protocol defined as an event where t he clinical  
investigator or site personnel did not conduct protocol -required procedures according to the study  
protocol. The investigator or delegated site personnel should contact [CONTACT_865384]. Site personnel should work 
with subjects to ensure subject follow-up visits are  scheduled within the visit window; however, any 
visits completed outside of the visit window will require a protocol deviation to be reported. All protocol 
deviations must be reported on the Protocol  Deviation eCRF  promptly  after the site’s awareness of the 
deviation and submitted to the IRB/EC (as required).  
 Deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_865385]. The sponsor may choose to terminate the study at a site for failure to follow the written protocol and  investigator agreement. If this occurs, 
the Investigator, IRB/EC and governing regulatory authority (i f applicable) will be notified in writing of 
the reasons for the termination.  
9.9. Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation  
Subjects are free to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. All implanted  
subjects will be followed until the 1-week f ollow-up visit, unless withdrawn from the study. Withdrawn  
or exited subjects will be followed under normal medical practice.

  Examples of reasons for study discontinuation include, but are not limited to, those listed below: 
− Subject death  
− Subject lost to follow -up 
− Subject voluntarily withdraws from the study  
− Investigator terminates the subject’s participation in the study due to lack of 
compliance, violation of/change in eligibility criteria  
− Any clinical laboratory abnormality, current illness, or other medical condition or situation  occurs such that con tinued study participation would not be in the best 
interest of the subject.  
− Normal study completion  
 
Prior to deeming a subject lost to follow -up, telephone calls must be documented in the subject’s 
medical record. If a minimum of three attempts to contact [CONTACT_731413] (e.g. phone and mailed letter), and no response is received, the site should exit the subject and complete the Study Exit eCRF. 
When a subject is withdrawn from the study, the Study Exit eCRF is to be completed and should include  
detailed notes as to why the subject was withdrawn from the study (e.g., discomfort, lack of efficacy,  
diary too burdensome). Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.  
Once a subject completes participation in the study, follow -up will continue in accordanc e with the site’s  
standard of care. No study specific medical care will be provided for a subject after discontinuation  
from the study, unless outlined in the Clinical Trial Agreement and Informed Consent Form.  
10. Risks and Benefits  
10.1.  Potential Risks  
The risks outlined below are the same risks found in commercial use of the BE lead and foramen needle . 
No study specific risks are present.  
 
The clinical investigation has been designed to involve as little pain, discomfort, fear and any other foreseeable risk as possible for the subjects, and both the risk threshold and the degree of distress are 
specifically defined in the clinical investigation plan and constantly monitored.  
10.1.1.  
Risks Outlined in the Instructions for Prescribers (IFP)  / 
Instructions for Use (IFU)  
Refer to the appropriate Instructions for Prescribers (IFP) and  Instructions for Use (IFU)  for the InterStim 
System components for an updated list on contraindications, precautions, warnings, adverse events, 
directions for use and other product specific de tails on the InterStim System .

  Patients should be appropriate candidates for therapy evaluation and for potential surgical  
implant of a SNM system. Patients are contraindicated for therapy evaluation if they are  
unable to properly operate the handset, external neurostimulator (ENS), and accessories.  
In addition to the risks normally associated with surgery, the following adverse events may  
occur with use of the BE  lead and accessories.  
▪ Tissue damage 
▪ Infection  
▪ Technical device problems  
The following  adverse events may occur with implantation or use of a neuromodulation system for 
sacral  neuromodulation.  
• Adverse change in voiding function (bowel and/or bladder)  
• Allergic or immune system response to the implanted materials that could result in  device rejections  
• Change in sensation of stimulation which has been described as uncomfortable (jolting or shocking) by 
[CONTACT_541270]  
• Infection  
• New pain  
• Pain at neurostimulator and/or lead site  
• Seroma, hemorrhage, and/or hematoma  
• Suspected lead or neurostimulator migration or erosion  
• Suspected nerve injury  
• Suspected technical device problem  
• Transient electric shock  
The risk level for the devices and implant procedure is the same if the subject is in this clinical trial or 
not. Certain  adverse events may necessitate surgical intervention.  
10.2.  Potential Benefits  
Subjects will not receive any direct medical benefit from participation in this study. Participation in this 
study will not provide greater benefit than if the subject was receiving a therapy evaluation with the BE 
lead, foramen needles or procedure kit  outside of the study. Information from this study might help 
researchers further understand the BE lead  implant procedure and therapy evaluation. The benefit to 
subjects participating in this study, and to future patients, resides in the knowledge gained from this study.  
10.3.  Risk-Benefit Rationale  
Participation in this study will not expose the subject to great er risks than if he/she were receiving a BE  
lead implant procedure and therapy evaluation outside of the study. There might be other discomforts and risks related to a BE  lead implant and therapy evaluation and/or this study that are not foreseen at 
this time.

The risks associated with a BE lead implant and therapy evaluation are minimized in this study by 
[CONTACT_865386], selecting an appropriate 
patient population via inclusion/exclusion screening, and monitoring subject progress  and events 
reported for this study. The review and minimization of the potential risks to the patient and the potential benefits to the patient support the conduct of this study.  
11. Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies  
11.1.  Definitions/Classifications  
Any adver se event meeting the definition of: serious, device related, therapy related and/or procedure  
related as well as all device deficiencies will be considered reportable for this study. The term  
“investigational device” is part of ISO  [ZIP_CODE] definitions. The term “investigational device” refers to any  
device used in the study including market released devices. Adverse events and device deficiencies are  
defined as follows: 
− Device Related: An adverse event that results from the presence or performance (intended o r otherwise) of the BE lead, foramen needle or BE  kit 
− Procedure Related: An adverse event that occurs due to any procedure related to the implantation or surgical modification of the BE lead. The procedure is defined as the lead placement / implant procedure and surgical modification (explant 
procedure). 
− Therapy Related: An adverse event related to therapy delivery by [INVESTIGATOR_16897] e.g. device 
stimulation issue (normally therapy -related events resolve when the device is 
turned off or reprogrammed).  
 
Adverse  events that are classified as possible, probable or causal are considered to be related.

belongs to or of similar devices and procedures, generally is considered “not 
related”. Yet, the unexpected effect shall not be excluded from evaluation and 
reporting.  
2If an investigational device gives an incorrect diagnosis, the patient might, for 
example, receive an unnecessary treatment and incur all the risks that accompany 
that treatment, or might be incorrectly diagnosed wi th a serious disease. In other 
cases, the patient might not receive an effective treatment (thereby [CONTACT_865388] ) or might not be diagnosed with the

Unlikely  The relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can 
be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be 
obtained.  
Possible  The relationship with the use of the investigational device is weak but cannot be 
ruled out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or 
concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or 
treatment). Cases were relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be cl assified as possible. 
Probable  The relationship with the use of the investigational device seems relevant and/or 
the event cannot reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information

other supporting data  
Medtronic  MedDRA term assigned based on the data 
provided by [CONTACT_865390]’s medical record and on an Adverse Event  eCRF and promptly reported to Medtronic based on Table 11 -2.  IRB/EC reporting must be completed in 
accordance with the policies of the governing IRB/EC.   Governing regulatory authority reporting along with safety and vigilance reporting  will be completed in accordance with applicable local regulations.  
Reports of adverse events will include the following information, at a minimum:  
• Date of event  
• Diagnos is or description of the event  
• Assessment of the seriousness and relationship to the product(s) under study  
• Treatment  
• Outcome and date of resolution  
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to identify the occurrence of reportable adverse events and t o 
ensure the required information is accurately documented on the eCRF.   
The clinical course of each adverse event must be followed until resolution or subject discontinuation 
from the study, whichever comes first.  “Ongoing” adverse events must be assessed at each protocol 
required visit, and new or updated information must be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and promptly reported to Medtronic and if applicable to the IRB/EC.   Commercial medical device reporting 
processes will be followed for complaint handling.  
If necessary, the Investigator may report to the sponsor initially by [CONTACT_731415] -up 
with completed eCRFs and, if possible, copi[INVESTIGATOR_731393] (e.g., 
physician/nurse notes or summaries).    
Medtronic study personnel will promptly review all reported adverse events and if necessary request 
clarification and/or additional information from the Investigator.  If Medtronic disagrees with the 
Investigator’s assessment of the adverse event relationship to device, therapy and/or procedure,

  Medtronic study personnel will document the disagreement and report or ensure reporting of both 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_534526]/EC as necessary.  All reported adverse events will be reviewed by a Medtronic Medical 
Advisor to ensure  consistent reporting . 
9.1.1.  Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency (DD) is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, misuse or use errors, and inadequate labeling. All device deficiencies must be documented and submitted to 
Medtronic on the Device Deficiency eCRF. In addition, the Investigator must also determine and document on the eCRF device deficiencies that did not lead to adverse event but could have led to a 
serious adverse device effect:  
• if either suitable action had not been taken,  
• if intervention had not been made, or  
• if circumstances had been less fortunate  
9.1.2.  Deaths 
All subject deaths must be reported to Medtronic and the IRB/EC  as soon as possible, but no more than 
[ADDRESS_1207215]’s death, regardless of whether or not the death is related to the device system or therapy. If limited information is known, the Adverse Event eCRF must be 
completed with ava ilable information as soon as possible. As information becomes available, the eCRF 
will be updated. If the death occurs at a location remote from the study site, it is the study site’s 
responsibility to make every attempt to retrieve all pertinent informat ion related to the subject’s death 
and submit the investigator’s death summary of the known events surrounding the death to Medtronic or its designee.  The Investigator should also attempt to determine, as conclusively as possible, whether 
such deaths are related to the device system, therapy, and/or procedure.   In addition, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_865367]. The principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_865368] a s possible for deaths:  
• Death certificate  
• Death summary/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], if allowed by [CONTACT_54443]/local law 
• Autopsy report, if allowed by [CONTACT_54443]/local law  
All device system components that were being used at the time of the death should be returned to Medtronic for analysis, if applicable. Any subject death will be reported on the Adverse Event and Study 
Exit CRFs.

  12. Data Review Committees  
This study will not use a Clinical Events Committee or Data Monitoring Committee. Instead, all reported  
adverse events and device deficiencies will be reviewed by a Medtronic Medical Advisor to ensure  
consistent reporting as defined in Section 11.2.  
13. Statistical Design and Methods  
13.1.  General Statistical Considerations  
Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_13735] -employed statistic ians or designees. A validated statistical 
software package will be used for the analyses of the study results (e.g. SAS version 9.4 or higher).  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed prior to data analysis and will include a 
comprehensive description of the statistical methods to be included in the final study report. Any 
change to the data analysis methods described in the CIP will require an amendment only if it changes a 
principal feature of the CIP. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the CIP, and the 
justification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report.

  13.3.  Primary Objective – Motor or Sensory Response  
To characterize proportion  of subjects who demonstrate motor or sensory response(s) during lead 
placement using the InterStim BE  Lead.  
Hypothesis  
There is no formal hypothesis. The objective is to estimate the proportion of subjects who demonstrate 
motor or sensory response(s) during lead placement using the InterStim BE  Lead.  
Experimental Design  
During the lead placement procedure using the InterStim BE lead , subject’s motor and/ or sensory 
response will be collected as spec ified in Section 9.5. Subject s may be implanted with more than one  BE 
lead.  In this case  subject’s motor and/or sensory response from all implanted BE  leads will be recorded. 
In case more than one BE lead is implanted, t he subject is considered as demonstrating a response if 
motor or sensory response is obtained from at least one  BE lead.  
Analysis Methods  
Subjects who had the BE  lead placement and provide data (completers) will be included in the primary 
analysis. The  primary analysis will report the  proportion of subjects who obtain motor or sensory 
response and its two -sided exact binomial 95% CI among those who had lead placement .  
In cases w here surgical modifications for BE leads are needed, motor or sensory response from the 
initial lead placement will be used for the primary analysi s 
In cases where  subject’s motor or sensory response is not tested, or response data are lost during lead 
placement, or other reasons where missing data occur, a sensitivity analysis will be performed by 
[CONTACT_865393] s on the potential impact of missing data  by [CONTACT_865394] a response t o none of the missing values as not obtaining a 
response.   
In addition to the subject  level analysis described above, a lead level supporting analysis will be 
performed by [CONTACT_865395](s) during 
initial lead placement. The leads that have motor or sensory responses during replacement  BE lead 
implant will be summarized separately.

 1 BACKGROUND  
 
CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has long recommended annual influenza 
vaccination for all persons aged ≥[ADDRESS_28645] contraindications.  In June 2018, ACIP voted 
to reaffirm this core recommendation for the 2018- 2019 influen za season.  Specifically, ACIP stated that: 
For the 2018-19 season, immunization providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-
appropriate, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). LAIV4 is an option for those for whom it is otherwise appropriate
1.  Influenza vaccination is particularly important for persons at high risk for 
medical complications attributed to severe influenza.1  It is anticipated that the recommendations will be 
similar for the 2019- 20 season. ACIP designates persons with asthma t o be at higher risk for severe 
influenza.1  
 Asthma, a chronic, inflammatory disease of the pulmonary airways, can be life- threatening if not 
adequately managed.
2 According to the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), in 2016, 8.4 
million children <18 years (9.3%) had (current) asthma, with increased prevalence of asthma among older, compared with younger children [0- 4 years ( 3.8%); 5 -11 years ( 9.6%); 12 -17 years (10.5%)].
[ADDRESS_28646] asthma ( 10.7%) than 
children in families that were not disadvantaged (6.7 %).[ADDRESS_28647] 5 5%, up from 32% in 2004-2005, yet, this 
proportion still falls short of the Healthy People 2020 influenza vaccination goal of 80% for children with 
asthma (aged 6 months- 17 years).6-8    
 Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)  is administered intranasally , and replication of the vaccine 
virus occurs primarily in nasopharyngeal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] . This replication can lead to sym ptoms of nasal 
congestion.
9,10   Since 2013, all LAIV formulations used in the [LOCATION_002] ha ve been quadrivalent 
LAIV (LAIV4) ( FluMist® Quadrivalent ).  The Warnings and Precautions section of the FDA package 
insert for LAIV 4 states that , “persons of any age with asthma may be at increased risk of wheezing 
following the a dministration (of LAIV)” .10  Similarly, ACIP considers a sthma in persons aged ≥5 years a 
precaution for LAIV use.1  Because of the potential  for increased risk of wheezing after LAIV,  the use of 
LAIV in persons with asthma has been an area of vaccine safety research for many years; the  safety  issue 
remain s unresolved . Broadening the LAIV recommendation to include persons with asthma could have 
several advantages: 1. Ease of program implementation, especially in busy clinic or school-based vaccination settings; 2. Ease of implementation and greater options for influenza pandemic preparedness; and 3. Grea ter options for children with needle phobia. A clinical study to assess the safety of LAIV4 in 
children with asthma could expand the evidence base and inform clinical decision-making and public 
health policy.  Below we present a summary of the safety data of LAIV in children and recent changes in 
ACIP recommendations for use of LAIV.  
 
Review of Safety Evidence for LAIV in Children .  In 2014, after completing a review of available 
evidence, ACIP concluded that for healthy children aged 2- 8 years, risks for harms assessed (including 
fever, wheezing, and serious adverse events) appeared to be similar for LAIV and IIV.[ADDRESS_28648] a prior history of asthma and wheezing.12 However, data 
regarding LAIV safety in persons with a history of asthma or wheeze were less clear.12-14 One study of 
LAIV safety specified in the methods that children with severe asthma were included; no safety concerns 
were identified, but the small study (N=48) conducted in one season limited the ability to draw 
conclusions.13 There is even less information about the safety of LAIV4 in persons with asthma when 
compared with trivalent LAIV ; LAIV4 has been the only live influenza vaccine product available in the 
[LOCATION_002]  since the 2013-[ADDRESS_28649] decade. These will be briefly summarized to provide a context for the prop osed study. 
Redding et al. assessed the safety and tolerability of LAIV in children > 9 years of age with moderate to severe 
asthma.13 They enrolled 48 subjects (24 participant s and 24 controls) into a randomized, double blind, placebo-
controlled study; spi[INVESTIGATOR_29331] a baseline forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_29332] (FEV1) and once 2 to 5 days thereafter. The primary outcome was the percent change in percent -
predicted FEV1 before and after vaccination; a reduction of ≥15%  was the prespecified endpoint . Peak flows, 
clinical asthma symptom scores and n ighttime awakening scores were also measured daily from [ADDRESS_28650] -vaccination. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure (percentage  change in 
percent predicted FEV1) between the treatment and placebo groups (P = 0.78). Secondary outcomes did not 
differ between the two groups either; these included the number of participant s with a decrease in FEV1, 
reductions in peak flows, use of beta- adrenergic rescue medications, asthma exacerbations and clinical asthma 
symptom scores befo re and after vaccination. The same proportion of participant s in each group experienced 
post-vaccination symptoms within 10 days (92% and 91%, respectively; P = 1.0). No serious adverse events 
occurred. These data were reassuring for the safety of LAIV in asthmatic children but were of small sample 
size.13  
 
To further evaluate the safety of LAIV in children and adolescents, a larger randomized, double blind, 
placebo- controll ed safety trial in healthy children age 12 months to 17 years was conducted by [CONTACT_29360]., in a large health maintenance organization.15 Children were randomized 2:1 to receive either LAIV or 
placebo. Children <[ADDRESS_28651] 
dose. Enrolled children were followed for 42 days after each vaccination for all medically att ended 
events. A total of 9689 evaluable children were enrolled in the study. Of the 4 pre- specified diagnostic 
categories (acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_29333], systemic bacterial infection, acute gastrointestinal tract events, 
and rare events potentially associ ated with wild -type influenza), none was associated with vaccine receipt. 
However, a significantly increased relative risk (4.06; 90% confidence interval, 1.29 to 17.86) of reactive 
airway disease was observed in children 18 to 35 months of age.15  
 
Given these concerns regarding the triggering of asthma by [CONTACT_29361], Pi[INVESTIGATOR_29334] . conducted an even larger 
open- label, non -randomized, community-based trial of LAIV in children 18 months to 18 years of age 
over a four -year period.16 In the four years of the study 18,780 doses of LAIV were administered to 
11,096 children. Medical records of all children were surveyed for serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
health care utilization was evaluated for medically attended acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_29335]. No 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.[ADDRESS_28652] a significantly higher risk for asthma events 15 to 42 days after vaccination (RR 2.85; 95% CI: 1.01-8.03), but this was not seen 
in year 2. The authors concluded, “…although the possibility for a true increased risk for asthma was 
observed in one of the four years of the study in children who were [ADDRESS_28653] because of the 190 comparisons made without adjustment for multiple comparisons.” They also concluded that LAIV was 
safe and not associated with an increase in asthma events in children who are younger than [ADDRESS_28654]-dose LAIV recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], including those aged 1.5-4 years, and those 
receiving 2- 4 consecutive annual  doses had no increased risk. Children with parental report of intermittent 
wheezing and those with administrative database codes for asthma during the two prior years had no 
increased risk of wheezing. In addition, during the 4 years of the study, 2,952, 3,092, 2,953, and 2,478 
children without history of wheezing, respectively, had no increased risk of new- onset asthma. The 
authors concluded that “LAIV administration in children aged 1.5- 18 years with a history of intermittent 
wheezing was safe, and was not associated with increased risk for medically -attended acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_29336], including acute asthma exacerbation during any of the study years.”17  
 
Ashkenazi et al. compared the safety of LAIV and trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV)  in young 
children with a history of recurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014].18 Children 6 to 71 months of age were 
randomized to receive 2 doses of LAIV (n = 1101) or TIV (n = 1086), 35 +/ - 7 days apart before the start of the 
2002- 2003 influenza season. They were followed for vaccine effectiveness and safety. Overall, 52.7% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 21.6% -72.2%) fewer cases of influenza caused by [CONTACT_29362][INVESTIGATOR_840]. Greater relative efficacy for LAIV was observed for the antigenically similar A (H1N1 ) (100.0% ; 95% CI = 42.3% -100.0%) and B (68.0%; 95% CI = 37.3% -84.8%) 
strains but not for the antigenically similar A (H3N2 ) strains ( -97.1%; 95% CI = - 540.2% to 31.5%). Relative to 
TIV, LAIV reduced the number of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29337] 8.9% (90% CI = 
1.5% -15.8%) and missed days of school, kindergarten, or day care by 16.2% (90% CI = 10.4% -21.6%). Rhinitis 
and rhinorrhea, otitis media, and decreased appetite were the only events that were reported more frequently in LAIV recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (monitored for 11 consecutive days after vaccination). There was no difference between groups 
in the incidence of wheezing after vaccination (during the 42 days after vaccination). LAIV was well tolerated 
in these children and demonstrated superior relative efficacy compared with TIV in preventing influenza illness.
18  
 Given the concern about the safety of LAIV administration in patients with asthma, a large open -label study was 
conducted among 2,229 asthmatic child ren aged 6 to 17 years by [CONTACT_29363] . during the 2002-2003 
influenza season.
4 Children receiving high-dose systemic corticosteroids were excluded from the study, 
but the study did not quantify the level of severity of the underlying asthma among study participants. 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0

 Nearly 70% of children were on inhaled corticosteroids.  No significant differences were reported between 
the LAIV and TIV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29338] a exacerbations (during 42 days after 
vaccination), mean peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_29339], asthma symptom scores, or nighttime awakening scores. 
Rhinorrhea and nasal congestion were common ly reported symptoms among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29340] 15 
days after stu dy vaccination ; injection site reactions were the most commonly reported symptoms among 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29341]. Overall, there was no evidence of a significant increase in adverse pulmonary outcomes 
for LAIV compared with TIV. LAIV had a significantly greater r elative efficacy of 35% compared with 
TIV in this high-risk population.[ADDRESS_28655] of the proposed trial.   
More recently, t he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vaccine Safety Datalink published a 
study assessing the safety of LAIV in persons with asthma.
19  They assessed medically -attended 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_29342] 14 days after LAIV (trivalent LAIV and monovalent 2009 H1N1 pandemic 
LAIV) compared with the 29 to 42 days after vaccination among persons 2 through 49 years over three 
influenza seasons (2008 -2009; 2009-2010; 2010-2011).  Most patients had intermittent or mild persistent 
asthma. Medically -attended upper or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (outp atient or inpatient) were not 
significantly increased after LAIV. This was true for younger children 2- [ADDRESS_28656]- licensure clinical study data, ACIP recommendations for live attenuated 
influenza vaccine (LAIV) use in healthy children aged ≥[ADDRESS_28657] changed over recent years. During 
2007-2008 thro ugh the 2013-2014 influenza seasons, ACIP recommended that either live attenuated 
influenza vaccine (LAIV) or IIV could be used for these children.9 In 2014, after completing an evidence 
review, ACIP concluded that data supported the superior efficacy for LAIV versus IIV in children aged 2-8 years; in response ACIP recommended a preference for LAIV over IIV in this age group during the 
2014- [ADDRESS_28658] superior efficacy over IIV.20 Therefore for the 2015-16 influenza 
season, ACIP removed the preference and recommended that either LAIV or IIV could be used in  healthy 
children aged ≥2 years.20  Due to concerns regarding lack of effectiveness of quadrivalent LAIV 
(FluMist ® Quadrivalent; LAIV4; MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) during the 2013-[ADDRESS_28659] use of LAIV4 
during the 2017- 2018 influenza season .1   The manufacturer (MedImmune/[COMPANY_008]) identified that a 
more immunogenic strain of post- pandemic A(H1N1) was  needed to improve the immune response to 
LAIV4. The manufacturer changed the vaccine formulation and carried out clinical studies of viral 
shedding and antibody response to the new LAIV4 formulation in young children.  Results of these studies were presen ted at the February 2018 ACIP meeting.
22  Based on results of these studies and 
additional investigations, the ACIP voted on F ebruary 21, 2018, to recommend inclusion of the updated 
quadrivalent formulation of LAIV (FluMist®; LAIV4) among vaccines eligible for use during the 2018-2019 influenza season.
22,23  On June 8, 2018, CDC published the updated recommendation for use of the 
Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4) during the 2018- 2019 influenza season : “For 
the 2018–19 U.S. influenza season, providers may choose to administer any licensed, age- appropriate 
influenza vaccine (IIV, recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV], or LAIV4). LAIV4 is an option for those for 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.[ADDRESS_28660].”23  It is 
anticipated that the recommendations will be similar for the 2019 -20 season. 
 
In September 2015, CDC’s Immunization Safety Office- Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment 
(CISA) Project awarded [ADDRESS_28661] a clinical study to assess the 
safety of LAIV versus IIV in children 5-11 years diagnosed with persistent asthma.  This study intended 
to enroll participants during the 2016-2017 influenza season; however, these plans were postponed 
temporarily during the 2016-[ADDRESS_28662] use of LAIV.  ACIP’s vote in February 2018 to recommend use of LAIV4 and express ed no 
preference for use of LAIV or IIV in children  during the 2018- 19 influenza season .  This vote ma de it 
feasible for this CISA vaccine safety study to proceed, and it is anticipated that the recommendation s will 
be similar for the 2019-20 season.

2.2  Study Outcome Measures   
2.2.1 Primary Outcome Measure  
1. Comparison of the proportion of participants experiencing an asthma exacerbation during the 42 
days after LAIV4 vs. IIV4 (until day 43).  
 
According to the 2007 Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma , asthma exacerbations, “ are acute or subacute epi[INVESTIGATOR_29344], cough, wheezing, and chest tightness ( or some combination of these symptoms ). 
Exacerbations are characterized by [CONTACT_29367][INVESTIGATOR_29345] n be documented and 
quantified by [CONTACT_29368] [spi[INVESTIGATOR_29346] (PEF)]”.
24   For  
this study, asthma exacerbation will be defined as :  any acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_29347]  (dyspnea), cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_29348] d uring 
the 42 days (until day 43) after influenza vaccination for which the patient seeks unscheduled medical 
attention (e.g., healthcare provider office  or Emergency  Department visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  or 
receives a new prescription for systemic corticosteroids.   
2.2.2  Secondary Outcome M easures  
1. Comparison of the proportion of participants experiencing an asthma exacerbation during the 14 days 
after LAIV4 vs. IIV4. 
For the purposes of this outcome me asure, t he above definition of asthma exacerbation (section 
2.2.1) is modified to include the time period of 14 days after receipt of influenza vaccine (LAIV4 
or IIV4)  
 
2. Comparison of the proportion of participants with asthma symptoms and unscheduled albuterol use 
during the 14 days after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4 (each is assessed separately).

 4   STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES  
 
4.1  Recruitment  
 
This is a prospective randomized, open label clinical trial in approximately 300 children aged 5-17 years , 
inclusive, with a physician diagnosis of persistent asthma.  The study will be conducted at three sites: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Lead site), Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349] 
(contributing site), and Duke University Medical Center (contributing site) during the 2018-2019 and 
2019-2020 influenza season s. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a single intranasal 
dose of LAIV4 or an intramuscular injection of IIV4, stratifyin g by [CONTACT_29371] (mild vs. moderate-
to-severe)  and by [CONTACT_551] (5-11 years vs. 12- 17 years of age).  Vanderbilt will enroll approximately  100 
participants , Cinc innati will enroll approximately 110 participant s, and Duke will enroll  approximately  90 
participants.  All sites will begin enrolling when study vaccines become available.   Recruitment will 
occur at various clinics at the three study sites.   At all sites, study participants will be compensated for  the 
initial clinic visit at enrollment , and  for each study visit follow-up (excluding reminder -only 
communications), as outlined in Section 4.3.  A social security number will be requested for the parent, 
legal guardian, or  child who receives monetary compensation for participating in  this study.   A child may 
participate in this study even if their parent or legal guardian chooses not to provide a social security 
number; however, the study  will not be able to provide compensation to the parent, legal guardian, or 
child  if a social security number is not provided.  
 
4.2  Enrollment  and Randomization 
 
Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either a single intranasal dose of licensed quadrivalent LAIV4 or an intramuscular injection of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), stratifying by 
[CONTACT_29371] (mild vs. moderate- to-severe) and age (5-11 vs. 12- 17 years of age) . Asthma severity 
level will be assessed at Visit 1 (see Table 2, section 4. 4).  Randomization will be done separately for 
each site. Each site may have more than one clinic to recruit participants, and proportions of participants 
with mild or moderate -to-severe asthma can vary by [CONTACT_29372]. Randomization will be accomplished using 
the REDCap System, hosted at Vanderbilt, or a back -up method if REDCap is temporarily unavailable . 
REDCap is a web-based system  that is easily accessible to the other collaborating sites. This study will be 
open label and study staff and participant s will not be blinded to treatment arm assignments .

 4.4  Assignment of Asthma Severity  
 
After the informed consent  process , asthma severity will be assessed for each child according to the 
classification schema described  on Table 2, section 4.4.1.    
4.4.1  Characterizing Asthma Severity  
Prior to randomization, it will be necessary to characterize asthma severity in each patient (see Table 2). 
For this study, we will only recruit participants with persistent asthma and will recruit within the full clinical sp ectrum of asthma severity described in Table 2 (mild, moderate, and severe).  For this study, we 
have created distinct  categories of asthma severity levels, using existing literature and clinical judgement. 
Study staff should use these definitions at time of enrollment to identify if the children have mild -, 
moderate -, or severe -persistent asthma.   For the purposes of our study, the categories of asthma severity 
reflect the intensity of medical treatment needed to: 1) obtain op timal control of asthma, and 2) minimize 
impairment and risk resulting from asthma. 
 This categorization was adapted from the National Asthma 
Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 that was issued in September 2011 and the associated Quick Reference Guide https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/media/docs/asthma_qrg_0_0.pdf

4.6  Individual Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_29330] (PEFR) Evaluations 
 Participants will be trained on the “at home” performance of PEFR using a digital hand held device 
purchased by [CONTACT_29378] s will get to keep after completing the study . The device is 
easily learned, and it can provide an objective measure of control of asthma symptoms. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a participant ’s PEFR is measured while standing by [CONTACT_29379] 3 efforts. These measurements should be 
completed in the evening, before taking daily controller medication, to minimize variations that may be 
influenced by [CONTACT_29380]. Additionally, the PEFR maneuver should be attempted after completion of the two surveys that assess asthma control (c- ACT/ACT  and PROSE) to avoid b ias in the recording of 
daily symptoms. All efforts will be made to minimize variation in technique; training in proper digital peak flow meter use will be accomplished at study enrollment and reviewed  at each study call .  
 
For this study, all sites will p rovide participants with a digital peak flow meter. This device has an 
automatic memory for peak flow measurements and each entry is marked  with a time stamp; thus, 
participants will be instructed to  record their daily PEFR data measurements on their memor y aid  until 
day 15.

4.7  Vaccine Delivery  
 
Only U.S.-licensed vaccines will be used in this study. These vaccines will be used according to the 
approved FDA package insert . The vaccines will be obtained from the study site pharmacies and will be 
administered by a licensed provider (RN, NP, PA, MD) from the study team. Both of the vaccines will be quadri valent . The  summaries from the package inserts of the two proposed vaccines are shown below.  
The influenza vaccines formulated for use during the 2018-[ADDRESS_28677]® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal)  
FluMist® Quadrivalent is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the pre vention of influenza 
disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine. FluMist® 
Quadrivalent is approved for use in persons [ADDRESS_28678]® Quadrivalent is not contraindicated for asthmatics, although persons of 
any age with asthma may be at increased risk of wheezing following the administration of this vaccine.  In 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0 
03July 2019  
  25 
 the [LOCATION_002] there is only one licensed formulation of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4; 
FluMist® Quadrivalent ; [COMPANY_008] ), and this will be used in all sites for the study.   
4.7.2  Fluzone® Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (suspension for intramuscular injection)  
Fluzone® Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4; [COMPANY_011]  Pasteur) is a vaccine indicated for active 
immunization for the prevention of influenza disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype viruses and type B 
viruses contained in the vaccine .28  Fluzone® Quadrivalent is approved for use in persons [ADDRESS_28679] using Fluzone
® Quadrivalent in persons with asthma.   In the event of lack of 
availability of Fluzone® Quadrivalent, another U.S.- licensed age-appropriate quadrivalent IIV product 
may be used according to the FDA package insert.29  
4.7.3  Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Single and 2- Dose Considerations for Participants aged 5 -8 years 
Evidence from several studies indicates that children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine (administered a min imum of 4 weeks apart) during their first season of vaccination for 
optimal protection.
[ADDRESS_28680] been received during the same season or consecutive seasons. See Fig 2, (Influenza vaccine dosing 
algorithm for children aged 6 months through 8 years- Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, 
[LOCATION_002], 2018. ). 
20  If a child needs two doses, it is acceptable for one dose to be LAIV4 and the 
other dose to be IIV3 or IIV4.  
 
Among participants 5 through 8 years otherwise eligible for enrollment into this study, Vanderbilt, 
Cincin nati, and Duke will assess during the pre- enrollment process and at the time of enrollment whether 
one or two doses of seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for each of these potential study 
participant s. For study participant s in the 5- to-8year age ca tegory who are recommended to receive two 
doses of seasonal influenza vaccine during 2018-2019 or 2019-2020 influenza season s, the following 
guidance will be used:   
• For those receiving dose #1 of influenza vaccine at Visit #1 during the study, t he parent (s) or legal 
guardian (s) will be educated to seek the second dose from their usual healthcare provider; 
administration of the second dose will not be a study procedure . Study staff may facilitate, but will 
not be responsible for , making the appointment for the child to receive the second dose of the 
seasonal influenza vaccine at the healthcare provider office.  The parent (s) or legal guardian(s)  must 
also be informed that the child wou ld be eligible to receive Dose #2 beginning 4 weeks after Dose #1, 
but that the study will request that Dose #2 be administered after Day #43 to allow for the study to 
assess asthma symptoms during a complete 6 -week timeframe after the vacc ination. If during the 
study a parent (s) or legal guardian(s)  changes their mind, and the child receives the second dose 
before day #43, the parent or legal guardian will be instructed to inform the study staff .  In addition, if 
there is widespread circulation of influenza virus in the local community  at the time of enrollment (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_29381] (s), in consultation with local public health experts ), this request 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0 
03July 2019  
  26 
 to postpone D ose #2 will be removed.  In  74% of influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2015–16, 
peak influenza activity did  not occur until January or later, and in 59% of seasons, the peak was in 
February or later.1  
• For children aged 5-[ADDRESS_28681] already received dose #1 during the 2018-2019 or 2019-2020 
influenza season s before enrollment in this study, and who are recommended to receive Dose #2, 
study staff will ensure that at least [ADDRESS_28682] elapsed since Dose #1 before administering Dose #2 during this study.  Study staff will document if Dose #1 or Dose #2 was administered during this study (at Visit #1)

In addition to the two questionnaires  above, several predefined events that could occur after vaccine 
administration will also be recorded for 14 days after vaccination (through day 15). These will include 
fever (oral temperature ≥100.4°F) , asthma symptoms , and other respi[INVESTIGATOR_19256] . 
Medication receipt, new prescriptions for asthma medications,  and any previously unscheduled healthcare 
utilization (medical office visits, ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) will also be documented on the reaction 
form. To ensure compliance with the reaction assessment, parents will be called , emailed through 
REDCap , or receive text messages on Days 4, [ADDRESS_28684] 14 days (until day 15) after vaccination, if the participant  
reports an increase in their symptoms and an increase in the need for medications for their asthma, the family will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_5984], so medical records can later be collected , if needed. If 
at any point a st udy participant is experiencing symptoms of any asthma exacerbation, the participant or 
their parent will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_29383] (PCP ) and inform study staff of this 
encounter.   
 
4.9  Extended follow -up for days 16 -43 
 After the initial 15 -day follow up after vaccination, there will be an extended surveillance period for 
safety assessment from day 1 6 after vaccination for a total of 42 days (Day 43). This will be 
accomplished by a telephone call , text messaging,  or email  through the REDCap system to the parents of 
the participants, depending on their preference and their availability, at day [ADDRESS_28685]/ACT  score will also be completed at day 44. 
 During the extended follow up period, parents/legal guardian  will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_29384] a new asthma 
medication prescribed. 
 
4.10  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded on the memory aid  and will include the need for new prescription 
or nonprescription medications for the control of asthma, an unscheduled healthcare provider visit or consultation within 42 days (until day 43) after vaccination, any other clinically significant event occurring at any point during the study period. Serious AEs (SAEs) will also be monitored through 42 
days (until day 43) after vaccination and will include events that result in death, were life threatening, 
result in participant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29350], result in persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity. Additionally, important medical events that may not have resulted in 
death, were not life threatening, or did not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29351], according to appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the patient or participant  and require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Medical records will be requested 
and reviewed to evaluate SAE and assess relatedness of SAEs to receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4

 5  RISKS  
 
5.1  Vaccines  
 
All participants will receive the CDC Vaccine Information Statements (VIS ) 
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current- vis.html ) before vaccination. With any medicine, 
including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions. These are usually mild and go away on thei r own, but 
serious reactions are also possible. Any medication or vaccine can cause a severe allergic reaction, 
including anaphylaxis. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million 
doses, and would happen within a few minut es to a few hours after the vaccination. As with any 
medicine, there is a very small chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death. 
5.1.1  Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV)  
ACIP routinely recommends IIV for children with asthma9,11,[ADDRESS_28686] any problems with it. Minor problems following a flu shot may include:  soreness, redness, or swelling where 
the shot was given, hoarseness, sore, red or itchy eyes, cough, fever, aches, headache, itching, fatigue. If 
these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1 or 2 days.  More serious problems 
following a flu shot can include the following: There may be a small increased risk of Gu illain -Barré 
Syndrome (GBS) after inactivated flu vaccine. This risk has been estimated at 1 or 2 additional cases per million people vaccinated, primarily in adults.  This is much lower than the risk of severe complications from flu, which can be prevented by [CONTACT_29385]. Problems could happen after any injected vaccine: People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about [ADDRESS_28687] difficulty moving the arm where a shot was given. 
5.1.2  Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) 
ACIP considers use of LAIV as a precaution for children aged ≥5 years with asthma.
1 In addition to the 
usual risks as described in the VIS  (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current-vis.html ), children with 
asthma might experience higher rates of asthma exacerbations after LAIV than with IIV.9,11,[ADDRESS_28688] been reported following LAIV in children and 
adolescents 2 -17 years of age are runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, fever, headache, 
muscle aches, wheezing, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea .10  
 There is also the potent ial risk of loss of confidentiality about the  information obtained as part of this 
study (see section 9) .

 6  REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Parent (s) or legal guardian(s) who at any time express any concern about symptoms or serious unsolicited 
events will be encouraged to follow up with their child’s health care provider. 
Serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be reported to CDC and all participating IRBs according to 
institu tional requirements.  
If indicated, adverse events will be reported to CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS). The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires healthcare providers to report:  
• Any adverse event listed by [CONTACT_29386] a contraindication to further doses of the 
vaccine; or 
• Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination 
(https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf ) 
[link accessed 5/2/2019 ) that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination. 
In addition, CDC encourages reporting of any clinically significant adverse event that occurs in a patient following a vaccination, even if there is uncertainty regarding if a vaccine caused the event.  
 
As noted in section 4.10, a SAE is an AE meeting one or more of the following criteria 
• Life-threatening illne ss  
• Death  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - An event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  
 
Additionally, important medical events that may not have resulted in death, were not life threatening, or 
did not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29351], according to appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the patient or participant  and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above.  These will be reported to the IRBs. SAEs will be assessed for 
relatedness to vaccine: related  or not related.  
 
Participants who report severe solicited AEs or SAEs or express any concern about symptoms, and/or 
unsolicited events will be encouraged to follow up with their pediatrician or primary care provider. Severe 
solicited or unsolicited adverse events are those that prevent daily activity and/or require a doctor’s office 
visit or a missed day of school or daycare.

8  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1  Sample Size Calculations  
 
This study aims to enroll approximately 300 participants (at least [ADDRESS_28690] 90 from Duke). We assume that the proportion of asthma exacerbations in 42 days (until day 43) after vaccination is 12% after LAIV4 and IIV4.
4 We also assume that ~10% of the children 
may drop out, yielding a total sample of at least 270 (135 LAIV4 and 135 IIV4).    We expect the proportion of asthma exacerbation in LAIV4 (experimental group) will be at least as high as IIV group (control group).  The power estimate is shown below, given delta of 10% and one-sided 
alpha is set at 5% level.

The null hypothesis will be rejected (and delta margin non-inferiority claimed) when the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the PE- PC is less than 10%.  IBM SPSS SamplePower

and interquartile range. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages. Explanatory figures will be generated to evaluate the data distribution.  Comparisons of demographic characteristics between LAIV4 and IIV4 groups will be conducted using Pearson Chi- square and 
Wilcoxon tests appropriately.   We will prepare three datasets for analyses populations for main analysis of the p rimary and secondary 
objectives.  These are defined below. 
 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:  
 
The ITT Population includes any participant that was enrolled, randomized into the study, and received a 
study vaccine at Visit 1.   
 
Per Protocol Population fo r 43 Days:  
 
The Per Protocol Population for [ADDRESS_28692] of major protocol violations for analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 In the ITT and Per Protocol populations, participant s will be analyzed according to randomization 
assignment, rather than treatment group.  If applicable, sensitivity analyses on primary and secondary objectives will be done on datasets defined by [CONTACT_1570].  For example, if a participant was 
assigned to LAIV4 and inadvertently received IIV4 that participant  would be reassigned to the IIV4 
treatment group in the sensitivity analyses.  
 
Adjustments for enrollment site and/or other covariates for study ob jectives will be described in the 
comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The analysis methods for the exploratory objectives, as 
well as sensitivity analyses, will be also be detailed in the SAP.  
 
All analyses will be performed using R 3.5.0 (r-project.org), SAS version 9.4, or STATA version 15, or 
updated software from these programs.  
8.2.1  Primary Objective  
1. To compare proportions of asthma exacerbations during the 42 days (until day 43) after LAIV4 
versus IIV4 in children with asthma aged 5 -17 years.  
 
The hypothesis for this primary objective is that the proportion of asthma exacerbations after LAIV4 is 
non-inferior to the proportion of asthma exacerbations after IIV4 (proportion of asthma exacerbations is NOT higher in the LAIV4 group vs. the IIV4 group). 
8.2.[ADDRESS_28693] -
vaccination (until day 43).  
 
The asthma exacerbation proportion within 42 days (until day 43) post-vaccination will be calculated for children receiving LAIV4 or IIV4 influenza vaccine.  For this calculation a child with an asthma

 exacerbation (as defined earlier in the protocol) on one or more days during day 1-[ADDRESS_28694] had an asthma exacerbation (dichotomous yes or no).  We propose a one- sided test for 
non-inferiority of asthma exacerbation in children receiving LAIV4 vs. children receiving IIV4.  More 
precisely , we hope to reject the null hypothesis H0 indicating a higher proportion of children with asthma 
exacerbation (above an acceptable margin DELTA=10%) in the experimental (LAIV4) group as 
compared to the control (IIV4) group. Namely, PE is the true probability of event (asthma exacerbation) in the experimental group, PC is the true probability of event in the control group, and DELTA indicates 
maximum clinically acceptable absolute increase in the probability of event in the experimental group 
over probability of event in the control group. We hope to reject: H0:  PE >=  PC + DELTA in favor of 
alternative hypothesis H1: PE < PC + DELTA.  The null hypothesis H0 will be rejected (and DELTA margin non-inferiority claimed) when the upper limit of the 95% one- sided  confidence interval for the 
PE-PC is less than DELTA. More explicitly, if pe is the estimated event proportion in the experimental 
group; pc  is the estimated event proportion in the control group; ne  is the number of children in the 
experimental group; and nc  if the number of children in the control group, then H0 is rejected if

8.2.3  Secondary Objectives and Secondary Outcome Measures (SOM)  
1. The first secondary objective (SO 1) is to compare the proportion of participants with asthma 
exacerbations during the 14 days (until day 15) after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4.  
 
Outcome measure:   Comparison of the proportion of participant s experiencing an 
asthma exacerbation during the [ADDRESS_28695] with 
the alpha level set at 0.05 and non-inferiority margin of 10% though asthma exacerbation proportions during the [ADDRESS_28696] ive (SO 2) is to compare the proportion of participants with asthma 
symptoms and unscheduled albuterol use during the 14 days after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4.   
 
Outcome measures:    
 
SOM 2a: Proportions of participants with asthma symptoms of cough after LAIV4 vs. 
IIV4 during the [ADDRESS_28697]-vaccination.  SOM 2b: Proportions of participants with asthma symptoms of wheezing after LAIV4 vs. 
IIV4 during the [ADDRESS_28698]-vaccination. 
 SOM 2c: Proportions of participants with asthma symptoms of tightness in chest after 
LAIV4 vs. IIV4 during the [ADDRESS_28699]-vaccination. 
 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.0

 SOM 2d: Proportions of participants with asthma symptoms of nighttime awakening after 
LAIV4 vs. IIV4 during the [ADDRESS_28700]-vaccination.  
SOM 2e: Proportions of participants with unscheduled albuterol use to treat asthma 
symptoms after LAIV4 vs. IIV4 during the [ADDRESS_28701]-vaccination.
 
Proportions of participant s with each asthma symptom (yes or no) along with 
unscheduled albuterol use to treat asthma symptoms (yes or no) will be compared 
between two treatment groups using Chi- square tests.  Proportions and difference of 
proportions between two treatment groups will be reported along with their 95% CIs.  No 
adjustments will be made to the alpha level (two -sided alpha=0.05) for this secondary 
objective. 
 
3. The third secondary objective (SO 3) is to compare the proportion of participants who experience a 
clinically significant decrease in Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_29330] (PEFR) from baseline during the 14 days 
after receipt of LAIV4 or IIV4.  
 
Outcome  measure:   Proportions of participants that experience a clinically significant 
decrease in peak flow measurement from baseline (≥ 20% in PEFR from baseline) after 
LAIV4 vs. IIV4 during the [ADDRESS_28702]- vaccination  
 
Proportions of participant s with a clinically significant ( ≥ 20%) decrease in PEFR from 
baseline (yes or no) will be compared between two treatment groups using a Chi- square test.  
Proportions and difference of proportions by [CONTACT_29388] 95% CIs.   No a djustments will be made to the alpha level (two -sided alpha=0.05)

11.[ADDRESS_28708] obtain 
and document the permission of the child’s parent (s) or legal guardian(s) , in accordance with the 
requirements of  45 CFR 46 and the local IRB. 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual agreeing to participate in a trial and 
continuing throughout the individual’s trial participation.  Before any study procedures are performed, 
participants ’ parent(s)  or legal  guardian(s) will receive a comprehensive explanation of the proposed 
study procedures and study intervention, study products (influenza vaccines), including the nature and 
risks of the trial, alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], any known AEs, and the other elements that are part of obtaining 
proper informed consent.  Participant s’ parent(s)  or legal  guardian(s) will also receive a detailed 
explanation of the proposed use and disclosure of their protected health information.  Participants’ 
parent(s)  or legal  guardian(s) will be allowed sufficient time to consider participation in the study, after 
having the nature and risks of the study explained to them, and have the opportunity to discuss the trial 
with their family, friends or legally authorized representative or think about it prior to agreeing to participate.  
Parental permission  forms describe in detail the study intervention, study products, study procedures, 
risks and possible benefits that are given to participant s. Parental permission  forms will be IRB -approved 
and the participant ’s parent (s) or legal guardian (s) will be asked to read and review the appropriate 
document.  Upon reviewing the appropriate document, the site principal investigator (or designee) will explain the research study to participant s and their parent(s)  or legal  guardian(s) and answer any questions 
that may arise.  If the participant’s parent (s) or legal guardian(s)  agrees, he, she , or they  will be asked to 
sign the parental permission document.  W ritten documentation of parental permission  is required prior to 
CISA Protocol LAIV-Asthma   Version 5.[ADDRESS_28709]  (seasonal influenza vaccine) . The parent (s) or legal guardian(s)  will be given 
a copy of all parental permission  forms that they sign. 
By [CONTACT_29395], parent (s) or legal guardian(s) give permission on behalf of their 
children to participate in all aspects of the study.  
The rights and welfare of participant s will be protected by [CONTACT_29396] s that the quality of 
their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in or withdraw from this 
trial. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_28710] practice for obtaining and documenting assent.  During the  consent/ assent process, 
study staff will discuss the study with both the parent and child. For children who require assent based on 
local IRB policies, study staff  will actively solicit the assent (affirmative agreement) of the child .  A 
child’s failure to object will not will not be sufficient to demonstrate assent.

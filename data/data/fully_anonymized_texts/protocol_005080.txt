SECTION  I: RESEARCH PLAN 
 
1. Statement of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.   
Our principal aim  is to determine whether a novel biopsychosocial intervention  following opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]  
(OD)  affects 1) the frequency of secondary opi[INVESTIGATOR_821903] 2) the proportion of individuals who remain  
engaged in treatment  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD)  or are in remission  at [ADDRESS_1139251] 
consent . We define remission  as engagement in daily medication -assisted therapy (MAT) —typi[INVESTIGATOR_821904]/naloxone (BUP)  or methadone — and/or a reco very capi[INVESTIGATOR_821905] ≥ 27.5.[ADDRESS_1139252] 1 opi[INVESTIGATOR_821906] , if offered , with 1) treatment 
with BUP, 2)  methadone maintenance, intensive outpatient,  or residential treatments,  or 3) education 
materials from the Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery (CCAR). Enrolled participants may 
switch from 1) -3) throughout. To carry out the intervention, a n addiction r ecovery c oach from CCAR and a  
health educator (research)  paramedic will form a team (RCP team)  and perform remote  (including over- the-
phone) and/or electronic follow- up visits after a  participant has experienced at least [ADDRESS_1139253] n Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s 
(YNHH) medical record system.  If the sources of information appear to conflict, then what is entered in EPIC 
will take precedence.  
 
Our secondary aim  is to determine whether the intervention affects 1) the frequency of positive -urine tests 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942] 2) the frequency and proportion of subjects self-reporting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. (We recognize that, due 
to constraints on in- person follow -up imposed by [CONTACT_25963] -[ADDRESS_1139254] likely 
to get urine tests are those who are in treatment and those who might subsequently present to the emergency 
department ( ED) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related complaints.) Our hypothesis is that our intervention will decrease both . As 
in the previous aim, data will be collected remotely/electronically from self- report and EPIC. If the sources of 
information were to conflict, then what is entered in EPIC will take precedence.  
 Data from our entire cohort will be compared in aggregate with patients who were started on BUP in the ED 
over the same time period and with historic controls  who received only printed resources addressing OUD as 
reported in D’Onofrio et al.
[ADDRESS_1139255]: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow- up and data 
analysis activities.   
The probable duration of the project is 2 years (from 09/2019-09/2021). There is  potential for extension after 
this time , depending on availability of funding. 
 
3. Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide  references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.  
Importance of problem.  
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_821907] (OUD) prompted a presidential declaration of a public health emergency in October, 2017, and it was extended in January, 2018.
2 In 2016, an unprecedented 63,632 deaths in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) were attributed to drug overdose; 2/3 of these involved opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].3 The deaths due to drug 
overdose in [ZIP_CODE] exceeded the number of traffic fatalities during the peak year of 1972,5 the number of HIV 
deaths at their peak in 1995, the final year before the introduction of triple antiviral therapy,6 and the peak 
year for gun violence in the US, which was 1993.7,8 Nonfatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_821908]. One study reviewing emergency medical service (EMS) records of 
Page 4 of 27  
 164 persons with fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_821909] 62% had been treated for at least one previous overdose, 
while 17% had 3 or more prior overdoses.9 In another large study involving a single health system, nearly 
10% of patients presenting with nonfatal drug overdoses were deceased within [ADDRESS_1139256].   
Buprenorphine/naloxone- based (BUP) treatment for OUD .  
It is known that MAT of OUD with BUP is associated with decreased risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], improved engagement in treatment at 30 days, and less self -reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_821910] a 
brief negotiated interview (BNI) or referral for counselling.
11,12 As a result of this previous research at our  
institutions, patients in our ED who are successfully resuscitated with naloxone following an opi[INVESTIGATOR_821911] (MINI)
 13,14 for OUD. Those 
who screen positive for moderate to severe OUD are offered initiation of BUP treatment in the ED, with outpatient primary care clinic referral for ongoing medical monitoring and treatment. At the time of the ED 
visit, however, fewer than half of these patients will consent to initiation of BUP.
15 Those who decline are 
offered overdose education and naloxone (OEN) by [CONTACT_175302]. A safety net that includes tailored linkage plans 
to effectively engage opi[INVESTIGATOR_821912], intensive psychosocial support, and follow-up counseling in the community is needed. To gain a better understanding of the motivations of those who 
decline the offer of BUP, we have purposively sampled 16 opi[INVESTIGATOR_821913] a qua litative research study looking at their knowledge and understanding of OUD 
(unpublished). Predominant themes included the following : ambivalence regarding the effectiveness of 
treatment for OUD, concerns about concurrent social supports such as housing an d mental health services; 
lack of appreciation for the risks associated with OUD (even with multiple prior overdoses); strong, but 
abstract desire to discontinue use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], despi[INVESTIGATOR_821914]; and limited understanding of how to 
prevent or emergently manage overdoses. These perceptions from the patient population with OUD declining 
treatment directly informed our proposed research strategy, which connects affected participants with community resources such as treatment with BUP.  
 
Peer support and recovery in OUD . 
In 2012, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) established a working definition of recovery from mental health and substance use disorders: a process of change through which individuals improve their h ealth and wellness, live self -directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential.
16 
The definition identifies 4 dimensions that support recovery: 1) health, including both management of the  disease and decision making associated with physical and em otional wellbeing; 2) home, e.g., a stable place 
to live; 3) purpose, e.g., meaningful daily activities; and 4) community, e.g. , supportive relationships and 
social networks. One of the interrelated guiding principles of recovery promulgated by [CONTACT_821942]. Peer recovery support services are delivered by [CONTACT_821943] g.
17 Since 1998, SAMHSA has sponsored Recovery Community Services grant 
programs, and in 2002 the program changed its focus to emphasize the use of peers for recovery support services.
18 This funding now targets recovery community statewide networks. The Connecticut Community 
for Addiction Recovery (CCAR) was established in 1998, with initial funding by [CONTACT_941] S tate’s Department of 
Mental Health and Addiction Services and one of the original SAMHSA grants. Since then, it has grown to its 
current size with a st aff of 28 recovery centers located in major cities, an ED recovery coach program, and 
308 volunteers who donated 28,841 hours in 2017 alone. CCAR recovery coaches are peer experts; many 
have been in recovery themselves. They have experiential knowledge and  training. More specifically, CCAR 
describes a recovery coach as a motivator who exhibits bold faith in an/a  individual/family’s capacity for 
change, and who encourages and celebrates achievement. The recovery coach is an ally and confidant who 
genuinely c ares, listens, and can be trusted with confidences, as well as a truth teller who provides a 
consistent source of honest feedback regarding self -destructive patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting. He or 
Page 5 of 27  
 she is also a role model and mentor who offers his/her life as living proof of the transformative power of 
recovery and provides stage- appropriate recovery education and advice. The recovery coach is trained to 
serve as a problem solver who identifies and helps remove personal and environmental obstacles to recovery. 
He or she serves as a resource broker, linking individuals/families to formal and indigenous resources such as 
sober housing, recovery-conducive employment, health and social services, and other recovery support. The 
recovery coach advocates b y helpi[INVESTIGATOR_821915], 
responsiveness, and protection of rights. The recovery coaches may also be community organizers to help 
develop and expand available recovery support resources, lifestyle consultants t o assist individuals/families to 
develop sobriety-based rituals of daily living, and friends, providing companionship.19 Coaches receive 
training at the CCAR Recovery Coach Academy, a 5-day intensive training program that focuses on 
providing individuals with the necessary skills to mentor, support, and guide any person who would like to enter or sustain long-term recovery from addiction.
 20,21 At this training, prospective CCAR recovery coaches 
learn about the roles and functions of a recovery coach, core values and guiding principles of recovery, relationship enhancement and  crafting skills, appropriate attitudes about self -disclosure, stages of recovery, 
addressing stigma, awareness of culture, power, and privilege, and addressing ethical and boundary issues. This Academy also teaches how to practice newly acquired skills.
20,21 CCAR recovery coaches’ style of 
treatment is generally informal, a nd they assist the individual affected by [CONTACT_821944], in addition to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_821916]. Reports suggest that fostering a support ive and positive treatment environment is 
critical.
[ADDRESS_1139257] of the available reports 
are in EMS trade journals, organization newsletters, public news releases, and other “gray” literature. For 
example, a Fairfield County, Ohio initiative called Project Fairfield Overdose Response Team (FORT) , 
dispatches a community paramedic and a law enforcement officer to meet with patients after opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178]. This is a community outreach model program that contacts patients, within 1-[ADDRESS_1139258] FORT had pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] 12 patients. Of these, 1 was known to be in an inpatient treatment program, and another had been admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_821917].
25 The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 
is collaborating with Baltimore City Fire Department ’s paramedics and the Behavioral Health System of 
Baltimore in a program that trains the par amedics to perform a screening test for OUD, followed by a BNI 
after responding to opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178]. At the time of their report, patients with OUD were being referred by 
[CONTACT_821945] a community -based research center within the Bloomberg School for counseling, 
motivation, and discussion of barriers to treatment. HIV (+) patients were preferentially referred to a medical 
facility for treatment with BUP along with management of their HIV disease. Their longer- term plan was to 
eventually transport clinic ally stable patients after overdose directly to a sobering center, similar to the 
protocol used in the City of San Francisco.[ADDRESS_1139259] other studies, early discontinuation of BUP is 
associated with poorer short - and long- term outcomes, and increased risk of nonfatal and fatal overdoses.

 The PRIDE program at Yale .  
We prev iously demonstrated that 1/3 of all seniors who activated the local 9-1-1 system due to inability to get 
up after a fall at home would activate 9 -1-1 again within the ensuing 30 days. Furthermore, 2/3 of all calls to 
EMS for a “lift assist” were repeat cal ls to the same address within the previous 30 days.27 We therefore 
hypothesized that by [CONTACT_821946], and by [CONTACT_821947]’ needs, many unplanned health care encounters could be prevented, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_821918]. Thus, a collaborative program between 
health educator (research) paramedics and home health care nurses was established at Yale by [CONTACT_8355] -
PIs of the current proposal. The program was funded by a Health Care Innovations Award from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2014. The overarching goal of Paramedic Referrals for Increased 
Independence and Decreased Disability in the Elderly (PRIDE)
[ADDRESS_1139260] or feel they are at risk for falling, 
reside within a 15 -town area in South- Central Connecticut, and reside at home or in an assisted -living facility. 
The program’s intervention involves home  visits by [CONTACT_821948]. R esearch paramedics record results of 
balance and other agility tests, participants’ medications, vital signs, and perform safety assessments of the 
living space. The home health care nurses evaluate gait, posture, cardiovascular health and medications, 
requirements for durable medical equipment, and ongoing care needs, such as physical or occupational therapy. All participant data are entered into a HIPAA -compliant, encrypted database: Research Electronic 
Data Capture (REDCap ®). Additionally, if needed, an appointment is made with the participant’s primary 
care provider, and a ride in a medically appropriate vehicle to and from the appointment is included at no 
charge. Subsequent unplanned health care utilization is tracked using the electronic medical record system , 
EPIC,  at YNHH. PRIDE has been operating for the last 4 years and has enrolled over 5,600 participants. Our 
interim data to date demonstrate that there are significantly fewer ED visits and less EMS utilization (Tables 1 
& 2) among those who received PRIDE servi ces, compared with participants who enrolled but declined visits 
by [CONTACT_821949]. These data suggest that PRIDE’s intervention is effective in decreasing unplanned health care utilization.  
 
 
Proposed adaptation of PRIDE to serve persons with OUD. 
We propose to adapt the PRIDE program infrastructure to provide a safety net for patients who 1) have been resuscitated from an opi[INVESTIGATOR_821919], 2) have screened positive for OUD using the MINI
29,30 

Page 7 of 27  
 and 3) refused to initiate treatment with BUP in the ED , if offered . We may also include  and accept  referrals 
from CCARproject a lcohol & substance abuse services, education, and referral to treatment  (ASSERT)  
(whose recruiters work  in the YNHH ED) , staff working in the Yale EDs and with American Medical 
Response (AMR)  units, the Community Health Care Van (created by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Frederick Altice), and from 
locations within the Elm City Communities (The Housing Authority of the City of New Haven).. For this 
program, the composition of the field teams will b e changed, pairing recovery c oaches from CCAR with 
experienced PRIDE research paramedics, to form RCP teams. For those affected by [CONTACT_60142]- severe OUD, 
we expect that engaging with the RCP teams will create a more robust linkage of care with community 
resources and treatment options. . Importantly, these teams will motivate interest in treatment, facilitate 
access to BUP or methadone, assist with other community -based recovery strategies, help address acute 
psychosocial issues, and provide ongoing education and counselling. The requirements for these capabilities were derived from our previous qualitative studies of persons with OUD who declined ED -
initiated treatment.
[ADDRESS_1139261] people with recovery support services, and help to build recovery capi[INVESTIGATOR_821920], optimism, and healthy living.
19 The speci fic mission of the  research  paramedics on 
the teams is to facilitate access to BUP, and help monitor patients’ responses to the drug. They will assess for evidence of withdrawal, for resolution or persistence of craving, and for signs of opi[INVESTIGATOR_821921], or 
intercurrent illness. From our previous experience with PRIDE, we believe that this team approach will have a 
synergistic effect on the missions of both members of the team, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for the patient. Fully integrated treatment with BUP along with individualized, sustained support by [CONTACT_821950]. Most 
research has focused on comparative effectiveness of individual treatment modalities. Importantly, in our study, the RCP teams will  assist the patients with self -assessment and dynamic goal setting, so that MAT can 
be initiated whenever a patient is ready, and there is no set duration of BUP or any MAT. Premature tapering 
of MAT , regardless of other support services, is uniformly associated with high rates of relapse.  
Page 8 of 27  
  
The RCP teams ’ support of persons with OUD will increase participant privacy and autonomy while working 
toward  clinical remission and multi- dimensional recovery. Medical literature continues to support promoting 
these ideals across disciplines.34-[ADDRESS_1139262] 
participants  in changing into any other treatment option in the safety net cohort. 
 
4. Research Plan:  Summarize t he study design and research procedures  using non- technical language that can 
be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times 
and lengths . Describe the setting in which the research will take place.  
To date, there is no standard of care for individuals with OUD who have overdosed on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], have been 
resuscitated by [CONTACT_161187], and have refused BUP treatment. As noted in the previ ous section, YNHH typi[INVESTIGATOR_821922] . However, follow -up care remains variable. Hence, we seek 
to determine whether individuals with OUD might benefit significantly from a  novel, team -based intervention 
encouraging biopsychosoci al and medical interventions. Our  intervention will connect participants with 
important community resources that we expect  will facilitate progress toward long -term recovery . 
Specifically, we will link indi viduals with moderate -severe OUD, who have experienced at least 1 opi[INVESTIGATOR_821923] , if offered , with 1) treatment with 
BUP, 2) methadone maintenance, intensive outpatient, and/or residentia l treatment,  or 3) education materials 
from CCAR. Enrolled participants may switch from 1)-3) throughout.   
We wish to assess whether our intervention connecting participants to community resources  affects 1) the 
frequency of secondary opi[INVESTIGATOR_821903] 2) the proportion of individuals who remain  engaged in 
treatment  for OUD or are in remission  at [ADDRESS_1139263] consent . We define remission as 
engagement in daily medication- assisted MAT —typi[INVESTIGATOR_821924]— and/or a recove ry capi[INVESTIGATOR_821925] ≥ 27.5. Our hypothesis is that the intervention by [CONTACT_821951]. We also seek to determine  whether the intervention affects 1) the 
frequency of positive- urine t ests for opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942] 2) the frequency and proportion of subjects self-reporting 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Our hypothesis is that our intervention will decrease both. 
 
We will conduct our study as follows  (Figure s 1 & 2  below ):  
To prepare for the intervention, health ed ucator paramedics  and key study staff are required to attend [ADDRESS_1139264] a brief negotiation interview (BNI) and a brief assessment of recovery capi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BARC-10) interview. Training also will prepare all staff to respectfully  ask questions about potential 
overdose events and the possibility of creating and/or implementing a wellness plan. 
 
After resuscitation from opi[INVESTIGATOR_821926], affected individuals in the EDs at the York St . and 
Chapel St. campuses of YNHH will be screened  for OUD using a MINI. As noted above, this is a n evidence -
supported, standard practice at our institution. Upon screening positive for OUD, individuals  should be 
offered BUP treatment by [CONTACT_3655] . Those who screen positive for OUD, but who decline BUP, are offered 
overdose and naloxone kits. In addition, by [CONTACT_821952] / EMS 
Page [ADDRESS_1139265], our study team will screen for resuscitated, OUD -
positive individuals , who  refused BUP , if offered , and may  approach these individuals  in the ED  to ask 
whether they might be interested in research participation . To be clear, due to limitations imposed by [CONTACT_821953] 2020 , as of 06/02/ [ADDRESS_1139266] in study participation, then the  study team members 
would set up an appointment to meet remotely  (by E PIC telehealth functions (if applicable), phone, Zoom 5.0, 
or other encrypted, HIPAA-compliant electronic modality) at a time  of the prospective participant’s choosing. 
Informed consent may be obtained by [CONTACT_821954], although the 
latter is more likely given the constraints of ED accessibility at this time . In addition, ED providers and 
affiliates from AMR , staff from CCAR,  P roject ASSERT, Elm City Communications, and the Community 
Health Care Van  may refer interested individuals  to study participation, providing that at some time in the 
previous [ADDRESS_1139267] social distancing and will don face coverings when using the office at  470 
Congress. Personal protective equipment (PPE) — masks, gloves, gowns, and sanitizers as required by [CONTACT_821955]—will be worn whenever appropriate.. All individuals who might work in the ED will undergo 
training in  proper use, including donning and doffing the designated PPE.  
 Consent may be obtained at the ED,  during community outreach events, electronically in a Yale School of 
Medicine version of R EDCap®, or remotely  (e.g., via email or pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]), in accordance with University 
guidelines issued on 05/21/2020 from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation. After consent and study initiation, either at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_821927], the RCP team will perform a BNI — whose goal is to 
employ motivational techniques to help those with substance abuse consider their reasons for wanting to 
address dependency. Electronically, t he RCP team will perform psychosocial and medical evaluations . (Please 
see the document, Survey T ool and Handbook , for details . It is included in our submission materials. ) The 
RCP team will enter  all data into a secured, encrypted database,  REDCap ®. To obtain consent or 
approximately 30 days after consent , the RCP team will schedule an electronic/remote (including by [CONTACT_648]) 
Meeting [ADDRESS_1139268] and enter 
data into REDCap ® based on discussions with and evaluations of participants. During an electronic /remote 
(including by [CONTACT_648]) Meeting 2, which should occur no more than [ADDRESS_1139269] and enter data into REDCap® based on discussions with and evaluations of participants. The 
study team will also enter  data from participants’ medical record s at all time intervals.  It is important to 
underscore that, due to the coronavirus pandemic, electronic and remote (including by [CONTACT_648]) modalities will 
be utilized to the greatest extent possible.   Data from the entire cohort will be compared in aggregate with patients who were started on BUP in the ED 
over the same time period and with historic controls.

9. Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, di scomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research.  
Overall risks: Because the procedures involve accepted forms of treatment interventions, interviews, and self -
report questionnaires, we foresee no special hazards. The principal risk to participants is that of ongoing illicit 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]—including the potential for over dose. The instruments have been used in similar projects in the 
past with no ill effect. However, another important risk is the possibility that sensitive, confidential information obtained during the study will be disclosed. Given the social and legal san ctions associated with 
the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , it is critical to obtain a certificate of confidentiality, which the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention ( CDC ), our funding agency, has granted per section [ADDRESS_1139274], 
and risk of harm to self and others, and advise subjects that continued drug use alone does not require reporting to child protection services.  
 
Page 13 of 27  
 Nonspec ific Risks : Risks from qualitative interviews, counseling, electronic medical record review, and rating 
scales are not beyond usual clinical procedures in drug treatment. Confidentiality of these results are 
specifically protected by [CONTACT_81918], and all r ecords will be identified by [CONTACT_120467], with the master 
file kept under lock by [CONTACT_978]. The psychosocial interventions used in the study are based on principles of 
motivational interviewing and have been used in clinical programs without adverse eff ects. Any potential 
risks (e.g., discussion of upsetting events), however, will be minimized through the use of trained, 
experienced recovery coaches. Women of childbearing age will be included in the study. We have assessed 
the proposed study as one of mi nimal risk . Nevertheless, because of the study population,  the potential exists 
for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur, since it is not possible to 
predict with certainty the absolute risk in the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for 
monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study.  
Also, as mentioned previously, the RCP team will respect all safety precautions, especially those pertaining to 
the coronavirus pandemic, at all times. The tea m will respect social distancing and will don face coverings 
when using the offices at 470 Congress. PPE— as required by [CONTACT_821957]—will be worn throughout all 
study engagements. . All individuals who might work in the ED will undergo training in proper use, including 
donning and doffing of PPE , in addition to maintaining mandated  hand hygiene and disinfection practices. 
There is limited possibility for in -person contact [CONTACT_52701], so risks associated with the 
pandemic are minimized.  
 
10. Minimizing Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above -mentioned risks will be minimized.  
(Please see above.) 
11. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on 
the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to 
subjects.)  Please see below  for details.  
 a.  What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this study? Minimal risk  
b. If children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the children participating in this study? N/A  
c. Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan . Examples of DSMPs are   
available here  
http://your.yale.edu/policies -procedures/forms/420 -fr-01-data- and-safety -

This study is  characterized as a clinical trial. Monitoring for data integrity and safety will be the responsibility of 
the investigators and the Yale Human Investigation Committee (HIC) (Yale’s Institutional Review Board (IRB)). 
The principal investigators (PIs) will be responsible for monitoring data, assuring protocol compliance, 
conducting the safety reviews, and monitoring the specified frequency of the reviews at a minimum of every 2 
months. During the r eview process, the PIs will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require 
modification/amendment, continue, or close to enrollment. Either the PIs or the HIC has the authority to stop or 
suspend the study or require modifications. Adverse e vents will be monitored for each subject participating in the 
research and attributed to the study procedures/design by [CONTACT_54852] ( Daniel Joseph, MD and 
Michael Pantalon, PhD) according to the following categories: 1. Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to 
study involvement. 2. Probable: Adverse event is likely related to study involvement. 3. Possible: Adverse event 
may be related to study inv olvement. 4. Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to study involvement. 
5. Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to study involvement.  
 
Plan for Grading Adverse Events:  
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study: 1. Mild adverse 
event 2. Moderate adverse event 3. Severe adverse event.  
 
Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events: 
Page 14 of 27  
 In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_170560] a 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE). An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 1. Death; 2. A life -threatening experience, in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; 3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.   
Plan for Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including Adverse 
Events) to the IRB : 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria: 1. Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures descri bed in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved protocol and informed 
consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 2. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research . (Possibly re lated means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and 3. Suggests that 
the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, legal, 
or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the Yale IRB 
in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the appropriate Yale forms. All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting requirements described in IRB Policy [ADDRESS_1139275] to oversight by a DSMB (or other monitoring entity that is overseeing  the study).  
 
Plan for Reporting Adverse Events  
For this study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified: all co-Investigators 
listed on the protocol, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board, the Yale HIC, and the Centers for Disease C ontrol. 
The principal investigators ( Daniel Joseph , MD, and Michael Pantalon, PhD) will conduct a review of all adverse 
events upon completion of every study subject. They will evaluate the frequency and severity of the adverse events and determine if modifications to the protocol or consent form are required. The risks associated with 
participating in this study can be categorized as m inimal . The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) template 
of the Yale University School of Medicine includes provisions for data review and performance of safety reviews, as de scribed below. Data and safety monitoring procedures in this study include secure computerized data 
collection and monitoring systems and an organizational structure of clearly defined tasks assigned to all research 
and clinical personnel involved in the c onduct of this study. The computerized study tracking system consists of a 
data base system that records research activities including enrollment and follow -up activities (assessments, urine 
collection, and treatment clinic attendance) and allows monitoring of drug use through inclusion of the results of 
urine toxicology testing. The PIs will use this database to monitor ongoing subject participation. The organizational structure used to ensure quality of data in this project include extensive training and close 
supervision of clinical staff and research paramedics in data collection, and preliminary review of collected data 
by [CONTACT_821958]. Research paramedics will computerize collected study data 
using encrypted tablets wit h specialized software ( Zoom 5.0. R EDCap®, EPIC telehealth, SPSS Data Entry , etc. ) 
facilitating efficient data entry and allowing elimination of out-of-range values and double entry of data for detection of key punch errors. All error corrections will be f ully documented in the research records of the study. 
All research personnel are required to successfully complete the Yale Human Investigation Committee initial and 
ongoing training in protection of human subjects and the responsible conduct of scientific research. All clinical 
aspects of the study that take place in a YNHH ED, such as treatment delivery and monitoring of subjects’ 
progress, are also fully documented and supervised by [CONTACT_941] P Is. Drs. Fiellin and  D’Onofrio  will meet monthly to 
review the over all progress of the patients receiving BUP treatment. All members of the research team are 
familiar with procedures for identifying and reporting possible adverse events.

12. Statistical Considerations:  Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design.  
Study design 
Primary outcomes  
The primary outcomes will be 1) percentage of individuals with repeat opi[INVESTIGATOR_821933] , identified using YNHH ’s electronic medical record system (EPIC) , and 2) percentage of individuals 
engaged in any treatment for OUD or who are in remission. Data will be recorded at baseline and at 30 and 180 
days after consent to participate in the research.  
 
Secondary outcomes 
The secondary outcomes will be 1) frequency and percentage of individuals with positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_821934] (urine) 
recorded in their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_821935], and 2) frequency and percentage of subjects with self -reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Data will be recorded at baseline and at 30 and 180 days after consent to 
participate in the research.  
 
Statistical analyses  
We will document demographics (sex, race/ethnicity, age, education, em ployment status, etc.) and clinical 
characteristics (e.g., heroin use, non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_40476] 6 months, lifetime treatment for addiction etc.) among 
all cohorts. Χ2 tests (2 df) will be employed to detect statistically significant differences.

For primary outcomes, “X” is % of repeated overdose events or % of treatment engagement. For secondary outcomes, 
“X” is frequency or % positive testing for opi[INVESTIGATOR_821936] % (self -reported) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554].  
 
Sample size determination  
We estimate that data from approximately 100 individuals will be used. Recent data from American Medical 
Response (AMR) suggest that in 2017, [ADDRESS_1139276] small -to-moderate (f=0.2-0.4) and moderate (f=0.5), respectively, effect sizes for these practices. 
Statistical power (1 -β) will be 80%, and significance level (α) will be 5%.

3.  Recruitment Procedures:   
a. Describe how potential subjects will be identified.   
Recruiters will review chief complaints in  EPIC from an office at  [ADDRESS_1139277] (an office that is 
close to the York Street ED).  Our study team also will accept referrals from ED providers  and affiliates such 
as the American Medical Response (AMR) transportation company, qualified mental health care professionals  
and trained recovery coaches at the CT C ommunity  for Addiction Recovery, and from individuals engaged 
with project ASSERT, who work  regularly in Yale EDs. In addition, we will accept referrals from Elm City 
Communities (The Housing Authority of New Haven) and from Yale’s Community Health Care Van.  
b. Describe how potential subjects are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Prospective subjects will be contact[CONTACT_821961]/or electronically at a later time (depending on 
when someone might wish to consent to participation) of the prospective participant’s choosing and by [CONTACT_821962] a referral.  Referrals from community outreach initiatives (see 3.a.) also will be accepted by [CONTACT_17881], who then will reach out, typi[INVESTIGATOR_821937]/electronic modalities and/or by [CONTACT_648], to prospective 
participants.  
c. Who is recruiting potential subjects?  
The study team —health educator  (research)  paramedics, recovery coaches, a research associate, and trained 
mental health care professionals and counselors— will participate in recruitment. Staff from Chapel and York Street ED  campuses , CCAR, Project  ASSERT, Elm City Communities, and Yale’s Community Health Care 
Van  may refer eligible patients to the study team in real time  when appropriate.  
  
4. Assessment of Current Health Provider Relationship for HIPAA Consideration:  
Does the Investigator or any member of the research team have a direct existing clinical relationship with any 
potential subject?  
☐Yes, all subjects  
☒Yes, some of the subjects 
☐No  
 
If yes, describe the nature of this relationship.  One of the co- investigators, [CONTACT_148011] chael  Pantalon, may refer 
patients from time to time. It is also possible that, if working in the ED, [CONTACT_495349] niel Joseph  would refer a patient.   
 
5. Request for  waiver of HIPAA authorization:  (When requesting a waiver of HIPAA Authorization for either the 
entire study, or for recruitment purposes only.  Note: if you are collecting PHI as part of a phone or email screen, you must request a HIPAA waiver for recruitment purposes.)  
Choose one:  
☐ For entire study  
☒ For recruitment /screening  purposes only   
☐ For inclusion of non -English speaking subject if short form is being used  and there is no translated HIPAA 
research authorization form  available on the University’s HIPAA website at hipaa .yale.edu.  
 
i. Describe why it would be impracticable to obtain the subject’s authorization for use/disclosure of this data: Yale’s EDs are fast -paced environments where new facts constantly emerge about any given 
case. The optimal and most practical way to identify  prospective participants in this environment 
would be to scan for chief complaints on display boards and ED charts in EPIC. Obtaining prior 
authorization would not be practical. This is also true for all other referrals.  
Page [ADDRESS_1139278]’s signed authorization for use/disclosu re of this data : Write here  
 
The investigator assures that the protected health information for which a Waiver of Authorization has been 
requested will not be reused or disclosed to any person or entity other than those listed in this application, except 
as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of this research study, or as specifically approved for use in another 
study by [CONTACT_2717].  
 
Researchers are reminded that unauthorized disclosures of PHI to individuals outside of the Yale HIPAA -Covered 
entity must be accounted for in the “accounting for disclosures log”, by [CONTACT_20911], purpose, date, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 
and a description of information provided.  Logs are to be forwarded to the Deputy HIPAA Privacy Officer.  
 
6. Process of Consent/Assent:  Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will be obtained, 
including parental permission or surrogate permission and the steps taken to ensure subjects’ independent 
decision -making.  
Depending on  preference informed consent may be obtained by [CONTACT_821963] , in the community, 
or remotely at the first outpatient visit.  All consent must be documented and given in writing. Consent may be 
documented electronically in a Yale School of Medicine version of REDCap ®, or remotely (e.g., via email or 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]), in accordance with University guidelines issued on 05/21/[ADDRESS_1139279](s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent:  Indicate how the personnel obtainin g 
consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being proposed.  
To assess capacity to consent, participants will be asked to answer several basic questions: e.g., the date, 
location, current President of the U nited States, etc.  If consent cannot be obtained, then recruiters will ask 
permission to set up a meeting time when the research might be discussed  further . During this meeting, the 
RCP team may consent the participant.  
 
8. Non-English Speaking Subjects:  Explain provisions in place to ensure comprehension for research involving 
non- English speaking subjects. If enrollment of these subjects is anticipated, t ranslated copi[INVESTIGATOR_20885].  
Eventually, we expect to enroll individuals who speak Spanish only and thus will  add a translated consent 
form.   
 
As a limited alternative to the above requirement, will you use the short form* for consenting process if you 
unexpectedly encounter a non- English speaking individual interested in study participation and the translation of 
the long form is not possible pr ior to intended enrollment?   YES ☐  NO ☒ 
 
Note * If more than [ADDRESS_1139280] speaking that 
language is to be enrolled.  
 
Several translated short form templates are available on the HRPP website (yale.edu/hrpp) and translated HIPAA 
Research Authorization Forms are available on the HIPAA website (hipaa.yale.edu) . If the translation of the short 
form is not available on our website, then the translated short form needs to be submitted to the IRB office for 
approval via modification prior to enrolling the subject.    Please review the guidance and presentation on use of 
the short form available on the HRPP website.

 from Elm City Communities ( the New Haven Housing Authority) may have access to de-identified data 
(including the number of residents from Housing Authority locations who either enroll in the study or are 
referred to other agencies (e.g., CCAR), and the number of program successes).  
1.  
 
2. How will the research data be collected, recorded and stored? Participants may sign hardcopy documents  or 
consent via REDCap ®. Study team members will enter participants’ data into REDCap ® (online database) .  
 
3. How will the digital data be stored? ☐CD  ☐DVD  ☐Flash Drive  ☐Portable Hard  Drive    ☒Secured Server  
☐Laptop Computer  ☐Desktop Computer  ☐Other  
 
4. What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of  the identifiable 
study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
Consent documents will be kept in a locked, secured cabine t in the Department of Emergency Medicine at [ADDRESS_1139282]. All data will be entered  into REDCap ® (noted above) only. This is an acceptable platform 
for entering and storing sensitive information, including protected health information (PHI) . Data will be 
entered into this site via iPads , laptops, and desktop computers. 
 
All portable devices must contain encryption software, per University Policy 5100.  If there is a technical reason a 
device cannot be encrypted please submit an exception request to the Information Security, Policy and Compliance 
Office by [CONTACT_20912]://its.yale.edu/egrc or email [EMAIL_364]  
 
5. What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable 
data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If no, describe how the data and/or 
identifiers will be secured.  
Once the data are entered and all analyses are completed , eventually all data  and consents will be destroyed 
after a maximum of 6 years from the study’s completion (see HIC’s investigator  manual).  
 
6. If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality been obtained?  
Our research is funded by [CONTACT_1629] R01 through the CDC, which no longer issues hardcopy Certificates of 
Confidentiality (CoCs) . However, as noted above, per section [ADDRESS_1139283], a CoC 
“automatically” has been issued by [CONTACT_334369].

SECTION  V: POTENTIAL BENEF ITS 
 
 Potential Benefits:  Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to 
the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.)  
Participants are expected to  directly  benefit from the educational, counseling, and medical resources and contacts. 
We expect that this will provide better outcomes in the short - and possibly long- terms. 
 
         SECTION  VI: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS  
 
1. Alternatives:  What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research?  
Participants may decline study participation or participate in another study. B UP can be started in the ED for 
individuals willing to accept it at the time of an OD. Other resources for harm reduction and treatment are 
routinely provided at the time of an ED visit, but are seldom associated with positive short- term outcomes . 
Page 24 of 27  
  
2. Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations):  Describe any payments that will . made to subjects , 
the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.  
Participants will receive 3 payments of $25 (for a total of $75) after  consent and after the first and second 
meetings. Each payment is given as a $[ADDRESS_1139284]  to Stop & Shop. Initial p ayments may be obtained upon 
consent in the ED; subsequent payments will be mailed or provided electronically, according to subjects’ 
preference s.  
 
3. Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations):  Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with 
participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost 
to subjects.   
The research will not generate any costs to participants, as we expect that  study personnel will meet with them 
at settings and times of participants’ choosing and convenience . All medical and laboratory testing is part of 
participants’ routine care and is not directly  a feature of the research itself. Additionally, for those ele cting to 
receive BUP, grant funding will cover its cost.  
 
4. In Case of Injury:  This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk, and for minimal 
risk research that presents the potential for physical harm (e.g., research involving blood draws). 
 
a. Will medical treatment be available if research -related injury occurs?  Yes.  
 
b. Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? Members of the RCP team (research 
paramedics and recovery coaches) are well trained in recognizing and handling a wide variety of 
medical concerns. Emergencies will be managed by [CONTACT_484738] 9-1-[ADDRESS_1139285] ED.  
c. Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? No. 
d. Who will pay for this treatment? The participant’s insurance provider or equivalent  
e. How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? As above . 
 
IMPORTANT  REMINDERS  
 
Will this study have a bi llable service?  Yes ☐   No☒ 
 
A billable service is defined as any service rendered to a study subject that, if he/she was not on a study, would 
normally generate a bill from either Yale -New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57171]’s

[CONTACT_20917]-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20888] (examples include x -rays, MRIs, CT 
scans, specimens sent to cen tral labs, or specimens sent to pathology). Notes: 1. There is no distinction made 
whether the service is paid for by [CONTACT_20918] (Standard of Care) or by [CONTACT_1758]’s funding 
mechanism (Research Sponsored). 2. This generally includes new  services or orders placed in EPIC for research 
subjects .

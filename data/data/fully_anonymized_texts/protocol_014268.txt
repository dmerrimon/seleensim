 1 HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES 
The underlying hypothesis is that the infusion of bone marrow (BM) or umb ilical cord 
blood (UCB) from a healthy unaffected donor will correct the collagen, laminin, integrin, 
keratin or plakin deficiency and reduce the skin fragility characteristic of severe forms of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_108631] (EB).  A secondary hypothesis are that fludarabine-based  
reduced intensity preparative regimen will be well tolerated and sufficient for  donor 
engraftment, and that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from a healthy donor wi ll 
enhance the safety and effectiveness of the allogeneic hematopoietic ste m cell (HSC) 
transplant as well as serve as a source of renewable cells for the treatment of fo cal 
areas of residual blistering.

2 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Dystrophic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_81490] (DEB) 
2.1.1 Clinical Manifestation and Natural History of DEB   
Dystrophic EB (DEB) is a group of heritable mechanobullous skin 
diseases characterized by [CONTACT_291747], blister formation, and scarring.  
The BMZ is characterized by a paucity or diminutive size of AF (Figure 1)1-
3.  The most severe form of DEB is generalized recessive DEB, 
characterized by [CONTACT_291748], blisters (up to 70-80% of the body 
surface), joint contractures, strictures of the esophagus, corneal erosions, 
renal disease and aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 
 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, [ADDRESS_356001] growing, multiple appearance and early metastasizing of the SCC in 
DEB patients, but the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_291702]. 
SCC can appear as early as 13 years of age and by [CONTACT_291749] 40 yea rs, one 
in every two patients will suffer and die from SCC. At 60 years, the 
cumulative risk of SCC is 76.5%, a much higher cumulative risk than the 
average person in [LOCATION_003] (4-14%). The prognosis of a DEB patient with 
SCC is poor with death in most before age 304, 5. 
 
Recently a study conducted with the National EB Registry showed that 
renal failure was a significant cause of mortality among DEB patients.  
Patients with severe form of DEB have a 12.3% incidence of renal failure 
by [CONTACT_654] [ADDRESS_356002] common cause o f 
mortality among adult patients surpassed only by [CONTACT_291750]5. 
 
Patients with severe DEB are also affected by [CONTACT_291751].  Daily activities 
(toileting, feeding, bathing, walking, etc.) are major challenges for these 
patients with many requiring complete assistance. For example one study 
demonstrated that only 24% of children with DEB can walk without 
assistance 6. The quality of life of children with DEB worsens with age. 
One third of the parents of a DEB patient based their marriage relationship 
exclusively to the day to day care and logistic of the affected child.  In 
addition, the majority of divorced families with DEB children blame the 
family disintegration on the disease7.    
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2 Recessive Dystrophic EB (RDEB )  
As shown in Figure 1, RDEB is due to a deficiency of collagen type VII 
(Col7).  Col7 is synthesized and secreted by [CONTACT_291752]. Arch Dermatol.  2001;137:1458-1461 (3). Lamina Densa 
Anchoring 
Fibrils Figure 1 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 10 of 61 proprietary document 
 and fibroblasts.  It is secreted within the basement membrane zone (BMZ) 
lying between the epi[INVESTIGATOR_291703]6.  Col7 is the major 
component of  BMZ attachment structures known as anchoring fibrils 
(AFs), which provide epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915]-dermal adherence1, 2, 3.  Genetic defects in 
the Col7 gene, designated COL7A1 result in RDEB8, 9, 10. 
 
DEB can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive 
pattern. The most severe form of recessive disease (referred to as RDEB-
severe generalized) is associated with extensive scarring and blistering. 
The skin blistering is usually present at birth and scarring starts within the 
first few months of life. The blisters and scarring are present at birth or 
become visible the first days after birth. The blisters in the neonate can 
cover the whole body, including oral and esophageal mucosa11. The 
blistering and scarring continues throughout life, resulting in disfigurement 
of both hands and feet, hallmarks of the disease. Other complications 
develop over time that contribute to the clinical profile including growth 
retardation, anemia, osteoporosis, renal dysfunction, lung and cardiac 
problems6, 12- 14.  
 
Ultrastructural and genetic evidence identified the cause of the clinical 
symptoms profile through life. Is known that mutations in the COL7A1  
gene result in abnormal morphology, low numbers or absence of the AFs2, 
3 which in turn result in cleavage or detachment of the sublamina densa to 
the underlying dermis with subsequent extreme skin fragility2, 3. 
 
2.1.3 Junctional EB (JEB)   
As shown in Figure 1, J JEB is due to a deficiency of laminin 332 (LAM5) 
caused by [CONTACT_291753]3 , LAMB3 , or 
LAMC2 genes (encoding the 3, 3 and 2 polypeptides of laminin 332, 
respectively),. Alternatively, some forms of JEB result from mutations in 
collagen type XVII (Col17) encoded by [CONTACT_291754]17A1 .  In all forms of 
JEB, there is splitting within the lamina lucida of the basal keratinocytes. In 
the Herlitz subtype, the hemidesmosomes are reduced in number and a re 
hypoplastic and anchoring filaments may also be reduced or absent.  In 
the non-Herlitz type, hemidesmosomes may be reduced or hypoplastic., IF 
staining reveals abnormal or absence of laminin 332 (LAM5) or collagen 
XVII depending on the underlying gene pathology in individual cases 15. 
 
All forms of JEB are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The 
most severe form is the Herlitz type which manifests at birth with severe 
blistering with little or no trauma and granulation tissue involving the 
trachea.  Congenital malformations of the urinary tract may also occur.  
Blistering and scarring continues throughout life, resulting in early death in 
many affected children.  In contrast, the non-Herlitz type may be less 
severe although it can be severe and often life-threatening in neonates. 
 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 11 of 61 proprietary document 
 Some forms of JEB can also be caused by [CONTACT_291755]6  and 
ITGB4  genes encoding the hemidesmosome-associated protein 6[ADDRESS_356003] been reported in 9 different desmosomal proteins, several of which 
can involve severe skin fragility (e.g. desmoplakin and plakophilin 1). Of 
particular interest, mutations in desmoplakin can also be associated with 
extracutaneous abnormalities such as cardiomyopathy which may start in 
childhood or in young adult life. Thus, if BMT is able to correct an inherite d 
disorder od desmoplakin, there is the potential to carry our therapeutic 
BMT in the clinical window between onset of skin fragility (at birth) and the 
later development of life-threatening cardiomyopathy. Although less 
common than RDEB and JEB, inherited disorders of desmosomes and 
keratins represent a subtype of EB that, in some cases, may also warrant 
consideration for BMT.

2.2.[ADDRESS_356005] been limited by [CONTACT_291757] .  
 
The main allogeneic skin graft used to treat RDEB patients is Graftskin 
(Apligraf, Organogenesis Inc., Canton, MA) approved by [CONTACT_13229] [ADDRESS_356006] cultures in a 
collagen matrix19. Apligraft provides the proper environment, growth 
factors, and components to stimulate healing and reconstitution of antigen 
expression in cases of DEB skin treatments in newborns20 and children 
with severe DEB21. In the latter study 79% of the wounds healed as early 
as [ADDRESS_356007] 
decreased itching and pain at the Graftskin treatment sites. However milia 
formation and erythema occurred for up to one year at sites prone to 
mechanical friction like the elbows, knees and ankles22.  In general the 
quality of life improved but what is not clear is the long-term survival of the 
graft and health outcome of treatments.  
 
In an attempt to enhance skin graft survival, combined use of allogene ic 
skin and BM transplantation has been performed23.  A 4-month-old child 
with Herlitz type JEB was treated with BM transplant followed by 
[CONTACT_291758]. In this case, peripheral 
blood stem cells obtained from the child’s haploidentical father 
(mismatched at 3 HLA antigens) were infused after conditioning with 
cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg, melphalan 140 mg/m2 and anti-
thymocyte globulin (ATG) 60 mg/kg.  Four weeks after BM transplant, 
rapid progression of skin blistering occurred, resulting in loss of 2/3 of the 
total epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  While GVHD was not proven, excess sensitivity to 
melphalan as well as the natural course of Herlitz type-JEB likely resulted 
in the intensified loss of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_291704].  Skin transplant was 
performed using split thickness skin grafts (2 mm) from the thigh of the 
father.  Grafts were placed on the dorsal trunk and gluteal region of the 
child.  The remaining wounds were covered with glycerolized allogeneic 
skin to reduce fluid and protein losses.  One week and 2 weeks 
afterwards, temporary grafts were replaced with donor skin grafts.  All skin 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 13 of 61 proprietary document 
 grafts healed completely with excellent biomechanical and cosmetic 
results.  Presence of skin derived from the donor was verified 17 and 67 
days after skin grafting, supporting the use of this strategy for permanent 
large scale skin exchange in the setting of allogeneic BM transplantation.  
While engraftment was successful, presence of Pseudomonas 
colonization prior to transplantation, excessive chemosensitivity to 
melphalan and/or delayed immune recovery after HLA mismatched BM 
transplantation contributed to the development of systemic opportunistic 
infection and death. 
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_356008] of allogeneic fibroblasts is to increase 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]' own COL7A1 mRNA levels leading to greater deposition of 
mutant Col7 resulting in the formation of additional rudimentary AF and 
partial functional improvement.  Nonetheless these results provide the 
‘proof of principle’ that allogeneic fibroblasts can have a positive effect and 
may be useful in particular for treating local areas that are repeated ly 
traumatized. 
 
Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells (MSC) .  Clinical investigation with 
MSC is expanding exponentially.  MSC are a well-characterized 
population of adult stem cells found in the BM, capable of forming fat cells, 
cartilage, bone, tendon and ligaments, muscles cells, nerve cells and skin 
cells. M SC have been studied in great detail and have been used in 
hundreds of patients worldwide administered both systemically and 
locally24-30. Importantly data suggest that MSC can repair damaged skin 
even in humans30. 
MSCs can be obtained in quantities appropriate for clinical applications, 
making them good candidates for use in tissue repair. Techniques for 
isolation and amplification of MSCs in culture have been established and  
the cells can be maintained and propagated in culture for long periods of 
time, without losing their capacity to form all the above cell types.   
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 14 of 61 proprietary document 
 Furthermore, MSC can be frozen and when thawed they function normally,  
thus allowing for future "off-the-shelf" therapy approaches.  At a dose  of 1-
5 x 106/kg (the MSC dose range used in most reported series) toxicities 
have rarely been reported28. 
BM-MSC are the most advanced population of MSC with regard to clinical 
development.  Osiris (Columbia, MD) has launched multiple clinical trials 
using MSC for enhancing engraftment and prevention and treatment of 
acute GVHD after allogeneic HSC transplantation.  In addition, Osiris has 
trials in the treatment of myocardial diseases and type I diabetes among 
others27.  The safety profile is established with few reports of toxicity.  
While theoretical, there have been no reports of ectopic tissue formation31-
33.  Notably, there has been one report of malignant transformation (MSC 
derived sarcoma) observed in one animal model 34. 
2.[ADDRESS_356009] is an established approach for the correction 
of various metabolic diseases, such as mucopolysaccharidoses (ie, 
Hurler, Maroteaux –Lamy, and Sly syndromes), leukodystrophies (ie, 
childhood and adolescent cerebral X-adrenoleukodystrophy, globoid cell 
leukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy), fucosidosis, 
mannosidosis, Gaucher disease, Niemann –Pi[INVESTIGATOR_285382] B, and malignant 
infantile osteopetrosis36.  The mechanism of action is through the transfer 
of lysosomal and perioxisomal  proteins from BM-derived cells into other 
cells missing the critical protein.  Together, these observations led to the 
possibility that allogeneic HSCT might correct the dermatological 
manifestations of DEB and serve as a treatment of other diseases due t o 
defects of secreted matrix proteins. 
 
2.3.1 Preclinical Studies- “Proof of Concept”  
Animal Model of EB.  With the information on the molecular culprit of 
DEB, the next logical step was to develop a DEB animal model in which 
the experimental hypothesis about pathological mechanisms and possible  
therapeutic approaches can be tested.  
 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, [ADDRESS_356010] readout for the cellular interventions. As 
BM has previously been shown to seed various organs, including skin, we 
reasoned that a Col7 producing cell may be present in BM 
compartment.  To prove this in vivo , we tested multiple BM candidate 
populations for cellular therapy of DEB in the animal model.  Populations 
tested were: total BM epi[INVESTIGATOR_193338], multipotent progenitor cells, 
MSC, lineage positive and lineage negative BM cell fractions, and 
transitional epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].  All cell populations tested failed to provide 
phenotypic correction, even when used at varying time points after birth, 
varying dosing regimens and varying routes of administration 
(intravenously or intrahepatically). 
Recently identified SLAM positive populations in the BM have been shown 
to have a significant pluripotentiality38-40.  Therefore, we tested 
CD150+/CD48- BM cell populations at multiple dose levels and infused the 
cells either in utero  (into preterm pups) or early postnatally into 
unconditioned DEB mutant mice.  CD150+/CD48- BM cells at a dose [ADDRESS_356011], all 3 mice were confirmed 
to be mutants, not only by [CONTACT_291759], but also 
by [CONTACT_7631], using PCR typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The weights of these animals were lower 
than that of their normal litter mates and they were weaned two  weeks 
later than usual.  The blisters on the paws of these animals healed with 
contractures, but there was no re-blistering noted.  Chimerism (presence Col7 at DEJ

of donor cells) was confirmed in 
the peripheral blood (mean: 3%) 
and BM (mean: 12%).  Tissue 
analyses showed that the 
adoptive transfer of donor SLAM 
CD150 selected BM resulted in 
production of VII collagen mRNA, 
as assessed by [CONTACT_291760].  BM cells 
explanted from the 3 surviving 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_291705]7 producing 
cells (Figure 2).  Remarkably, we 
were able to show AFs, structures in the skin that require Col7 protein, on 
electron microscopy, showing 
conclusively that adoptive transfer 
of wild-type BM cells resulted in, at 
least partial, functional correction 
of collagen synthesizing defect 
(Figure 3). Collectively, these data 
demonstrate the proof of principle 
of BM transfer for correction of 
DEB defect in the murine model41 . 
2.3.2 “First in Human” Clinical 
Trial    
Allogeneic BM transplantation is a 
standard treatment option for an 
increasing number of malignant 
and non-malignant disorders , 
including metabolic disorders 
where missing proteins/enzymes that can be replaced by [CONTACT_270730]-
derived cells from healthy related or unrelated donors36. To reconstitute 
hematopoiesis after an intensive myeloablative therapy, the 
transplantation of pluripotential HSC, such as from BM or UCB, is 
required. 
       
Between October [ADDRESS_356012] 28, 2009 , 7 children aged 9 months to 
14 years were enrolled in a clinical trial to receive BM and/or UCB after 
high dose chemotherapy (Table 1). All had more than 50% body surface 
area (BSA) covered with blisters and erosions before transplantation.  
They were conditioned with busulfan (BU, 12.8-16 mg/kg), fludarabine 
(FLU, 75 mg/m2) and CY (200 mg/kg) followed by [CONTACT_291761] (n=5) or unrelated donor UCB (n=1) on day 0.  Patient 2 who 
presented with significant renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 26 
mL/min/1.73 m2) secondary to perinatal cardiac arrest necessitated a 50% 
FLU dose reduction.   Figure 3

November 21, 2016 Page 20 of 70  proprietary document 2.3.4 Transplantation of HSC and MSC for Severe EB: Preliminary 
Results 
Thus far, 9 children (7 with RDEB and 2 JEB-Herlitz variant) have been 
treated on this protocol using BU, CY, FLU followed by [CONTACT_291766] ([ADDRESS_356017] blood donor).  As of 
March 31, [ADDRESS_356018] scheduled evaluation.  In all patients with hematopoietic 
engraftment, chimerism (6-33%) was also present in the skin with 6-33% 
of skin cells derived from the HSC donor.  Notably, one patient had 
chimerism in the skin from the MSC donor (4%) at day 100.  Three 
patients with increased protein had improved wound healing, and 
resistance to blister formation.  In the one evaluable patient with JEB, 
blistering markedly decreased. 
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_356019] included: 
hepatic veno-occlusive disease (n=3), acute renal failure (n=6) requiring 
hemodialysis (transiently in most), severe cutaneous toxicity (n=1), 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (n=8) requiring ventilatory support.  Therefore, we 
propose to evaluate a reduced intensity conditioning regimen, consisting 
of CY 50 mg/kg, Flu 200 mg/m2, TBI 200 cGy and ATG 90 mg/kg; a 
regimen used at the University of Minnesota since 2000 in older patients 
with malignant disease or those with pre-existing comorbidities excluding 
them from a full myeloablative therapy47.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Experience with CY50/FLU200/TBI200 +/-
ATG AM90 
In 2000, the reduced intensity conditioning regimen of 
CY50/FLU200/TBI200 was developed as a strategy for reducing 
the risk of regimen related toxicity and consequent TRM specifically 
for patients >45 years of age or younger patients with preexisting 
co-morbidities or active opportunistic infections, undergoing UCB 
transplantation.  Due to the finding that absence of recent prior 
chemotherapy (i.e., within 3 months of transplant) was associated

years) treated for malignant diseases. 
 
Engraftment 
Compared to historical controls in whom there was no recent 
chemotherapy, addition of ATGAM improved engraftment (83% 
versus 64%) in an interim analysis performed in 2007.   
 
In a more recent analysis using this treatment plan where ATGAM 
is added only for those without recent chemotherapy, engraftment 
is good whether the graft is composed of a one (90% [95% CI: 80-
97%]), n=43, median=16 days) or two UCB units (94% [95% CI: 91-
96%]), n=277, median=14 days). Multivariate analysis reveals low 
UCB graft cell dose (and not absence of recent chemotherapy) as 
the only risk factor for graft failure, suggesting that the addition of 
ATGAM has reduced the risk.     
 
GVHD 
The cumulative incidences of grades II-IV and grades III and IV 
acute GVHD at day 100 were 59% (95% CI, 49%-69%) and 22% 
(95% CI, 14%-30%), respectively.  
 
Twenty one patients had grade III and 3 had grade IV GVHD. In 
multivariate analysis, patients who received double-unit UCB grafts 
and those not receiving ATG AM had a higher relative risk of GVHD. 
The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 23% (95% CI, 
15%-31%) at 1 year with no factor identified as predictive of chronic 
GVHD.  
 
EBV Reactivation 
Among 95 patients who received an NMA preparative regimen, the 
incidence of EBV viremia or PTLD was 7% (95% CI, 2%-14%).   
However, there was a significantly higher risk among patients who 
received ATG (21% vs 2%, p=.01). Among 30 patients who 
received ATG, 5 developed EBV PTLD and 1 developed EBV 
viremia.  Patients who received an NMA preparative regimen with 
ATG were more likely to be older, male, weigh more, and be a

Due to the toxicity profile with a myeloablative regimen, a new conditioning 
regimen was developed that was non-myeloablative.  It has been better 
tolerated with less renal and hepatic complications.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Experience with the Nonmyeloablative 
Regimen In Patients With Severe EB 
 
Engraftment 
Thus far 12 patients were treated on with the non-myeloablative 
regimen.  Engraftment was good.    By [CONTACT_136866]:3 of 4 with a 
sibling marrow donor engrafted (one graft failure); 6 of 6 with a 
matched unrelated marrow donor engrafted (no graft failure) and 1 
of 2 with a mismatched unrelated UCB donor engrafted (one graft 
failure).  However, one patient (RDEB6) had primary engraftment 
but experienced a late graft failure after a viral like illness and 
underwent second transplant successfully. 
 
Importantly, while engraftment was documented in all , 3 patients 
(RDEB9, RDEB12 and RDEB15) required donor lymphocyte 
infusions to enhance the proportion of donor cells.   Two of the three 
responded; the other died from infectious complications prior 
complete evaluation.    
 
GVHD 
GVHD was uncommon occurring in one patient thus far.  Whether 
this is related to the immunosuppressive properties of the MSC 
infusion, differences in GVHD targets in the mucosa and skin of 
children with EB or some other factor, is as yet not known.   
 
EBV Reactivation 
Among 12 patients who received the non-myeloablative regimen , 
no patient demonstrated EBV reactivation or PTLD. 
 
2.3.7 Rationale for TBI 300 cGy 
 
Delaney et al 49 recently reported on the efficacy of TBI 300 cGy in 
reducing the risk of graft failure in patients considered to be high risk for 
graft failure. In a study where a ll patients received an identical treatment 
except for TBI dose, ie fluda rabine and cyclophosphamide as part of the 
conditioning and CsA and MMF for GVHD prophylaxis (exactly as in 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 23 of 70  proprietary document patients with EB), TBI 300 cGy resulted in high engraftment rates with no 
increase in toxicity.   
Specifically, in this study, 48 patients median age 59 years (range 25 - 73) 
and comorbidity index = 3 (range 0 - 8) with high risk hematologic 
malignancies received TBI 200 cGy if there was no risk factor for graft 
failure and TBI 300 cGy if the patient was considered high risk for graft 
failure.  High risk for graft failure was defined as receiving < 2 cycles of 
multiagent chemotherapy or no multiagent chemotherapy within the 3  
months prior to UCB transplant .  Forty-seven of 48 patients received 2 
UCB units (one patient received a single UCB) with a median cell dose of 
4.[ADDRESS_356022]-thaw median CD34+cells/kg 
of 1.75 x 105. UCB grafts (98%) were 1-2 HLA antigen mismatched with 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Twenty-six patients were assigned to Arm 1 (low risk for 
graft failure) and 22 patients were assigned to Arm 2 (high risk for graft 
failure) .  
All evaluable patients engrafted (n = 46). Patients on Arm 1 achieved 
neutrophil recovery (ANC > 500 x 3 days) at a median of 12 days (r ange 6 
- 38) versus 23 days (range 7-46) in patients on Arm 2 (p = 0.01). Day +28  
chimerism values were evaluable for 23 patients on Arm 1 and 20 patients  
on Arm 2. Median chimerism in the CD3+ compartment was 100% (57 - 
100) and 100% (0-100) on Arm 1 and Arm 2 respectively (p = 0.5 8). 
Median chimerism in the CD33+ compartment was 98% (15-100) and 
100% (44-100) on Arm 1 and Arm 2 respectively (p =0.26). Median 
chimerism in the bone marrow was 98% (15-100) and 100% (4-100) on 
Arm 1 and Arm 2 respectively (p = 0.84). This was maintained at Day +80. 
Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) grades II - IV was seen in 84% (n 
= 21) and 68% (n = 15) of patients on Arm 1 and 2 respectively with 5% 
and 12% grade III-IV GVHD in the respective arms. Chronic GVHD was 
seen in 40% of patients on Arm 1 (8 mild, 2 moderate) and 23% on  Arm 2 
(3 mild, 1 moderate, 1 severe). Overall survival at 1 year in Arm 1 was 
43% (95% CI: 22-62%) and Arm 2 was 46% (95% CI: 20-69%).  
2.4 The goal of this study was to assess engraftment rates by [CONTACT_291767] +28 chimerism in patients at low versus high risk of graft 
rejection. Although time to neutrophil recovery was significantly faster in 
patients with low risk of graft failure treated with TBI 200 cGy, patients at 
high risk of graft failure treated with TBI 300 cGy achieved a similar 
incidence of completer chimerism at Day +[ADDRESS_356023] increase in the TBI dose from 200 cGy to 
300 cGy in an attempt to enhance the proportion of patients with co mplete 
chimerism without the need for ATG or donor lymphocyte infusions .  While

The use of a FDA-licensed unit is preferred; however an unlicensed UCB unit 
that meets the required cell dose and HLA matching criteria (as define d in 
section 4.3) may be used if an ‘equivalent’, licensed UCB unit is not available.  
UCB units will be selected using the current University of Minnesota UCB Graft

November 21, 2016 Page 28 of 70  proprietary document fields, with the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_72301] a specially designed couch.  TBI will be 
delivered with a linear accelerator using 6, 18, or 24 MV X-rays.  Based on 
measurements of transverse thicknesses, aluminum compensators may 
be used to ensure that the dose homogeneity across the field is within 
10% of the prescribed dose.  Usually head/neck, leg and lung 
compensators are used (although based on calculated midmediastinal 
doses, lung compensators are often not needed).  A beam “spoiler” will be 
used to ensure a full skin dose.  Half value layer lung and kidney blocks 
will not be utilized.  Testicular boosts are not needed.    
 
6.2 Immunosuppressive Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_291710]. 
All patients will receive GVHD prophylaxis with 2 drugs as follows: 
 
Cyclosporine (CSA ) 
Patients will receive cyclosporine (CSA) therapy beginning on day - 3 
maintaining a level of > 200 ng/mL.  For children < 40 kg the initial dos e 
will be 2.5 mg/kg IV over 2 hours every 8 hours.  For children > 40 kg, the 
dosing is 2.5 mg/kg/dose IV q 12 hours. 
 
Dose adjustments will be made on the basis of toxicity and CSA levels 
with a targeted trough level of 200-400 mg/L (Supportive Care, Appendix 
5).  Once the patient can tolerate oral medications, CSA will be converted 
to an oral form suggested at 5 mg/kg PO twice daily. CSA dosing will be  
monitored and altered as clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_169879] D or physician.  
 
Patients with an HLA matched sibling donor will receive CSA until day 
+100.  If no GVHD, the dose will be tapered 10% per week beginn ing on 
day 101, to discontinue 10 weeks later.  Patients with an alternative (non 
HLA matched sibling) donor will receive CSA until day +180.  If no GVHD, 
the dose will be tapered 10% per week beginning on day 181, to 
discontinue 10 weeks later.  
 
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 
All patients will begin mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on day -3.  Patients 
<45 kilograms will receive MMF at the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 
hours (max dose 1 gm/dose) (PO or IV).  IV route will be used between 
days –3 and +5, then, if tolerated, may change to PO between days +6 
and +30. Patients >45 kg will receive MMF 1.5gm IV/po every 12 hours.  
Levels will be modified if clinically indicated. 
 
Stop MMF at day +30 or 7 days after engraftment or 7 days after control of 
acute GVHD, whichever is later. (Definition of engraftment is 1st day of 3 
consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 0.5 x 109 /L).

November 21, 2016 Page 29 of 70  proprietary document 6.3 Processing and Infusion of HSC 
6.3.1 HLA identical related donor BM 
• No T cell depletion 
• Infuse fresh, unirradiated with filtration of bone fragments 
• May be supplemented with cryopreserved UCB if available as 
source of HSC to supplement marrow if available 
• 30 mL of BM will be removed for potential future manufacture of 
MSC should residual focal areas of blistering be identified. 
 
6.3.2 HLA 8/8 allele matched unrelated donor BM 
• No T cell depletion 
• Infuse fresh, unirradiated with filtration of bone fragments 
• 30 mL removed for potential future manufacture of MSC 
 
6.3.3 HLA matched or mismatched related or unrelated UCB 
• Thaw, wash and infuse without further manipulation 
 
6.3.4 HSC infusions (regardless of ABO match) will be infused with: 
• Twice maintenance fluids initiated 12 hours prior to scheduled 
transplant and maintained for 24 hours. 
• Premedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, anti-
emetic (if cryopreserved product is infused). 
• The product is infused via IV drip directly into the central line 
without a needle or pump. 
• UCB products will be infused as soon as the product arrives on 
the PCU and within 30 minutes .   
• After the product bag empties (regardless of HSC source or 
prior processing), the bag and IV tubing will be flushed with 
sterile normal saline.  Saline may be either injected directly into 
the bag or a [ADDRESS_356028] tested negative for 
HIV-I, HIV-II, HTLV-I/II, hepatitis B and C, CMV, syphilis, CJD and 
tuberculosis, and free of active infection at the time of BM harvest, in go od 
health.  For unmatched, ‘off -the-shelf’ MSC, [ADDRESS_356029] for HSC collection.  BM from the HSC donor 
will be cryopreserved and stored until the time it is needed.

November 21, 2016 Page 30 of 70  proprietary document    
6.4.2 MSC Manufacture and Storage  
BM MNC ’s are cultured under standardized conditions.  After expansion 
culture, cells are removed for testing with the remainder cryopreserved in 
aliquots for future use.  MSC’s will be banked prior to use and will  not be 
released to patient until results of all quality control assays (sterility, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_291711]) satisfy lot release criteria (as 
defined in the IND).  Details on the manufacturing procedure, including lot 
release testing and specifications can be found in the Chemistry, 
Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) section of the Investigational New 
Drug (IND) application.  Only MSC lots meeting lot release will be 
available for clinical use. 
 
All patients who are enrolled onto this trial are eligible to receive “ off-the-
shelf” MSC. 
 
6.4.3 Administration of U nmatched “ Off-the-S helf” MSC ( dose of 2 x 
106/kg) 
1. Infuse 4 hours after BM or UCB infusion.    
2. Premedication with acetaminophen , diphenhydramine, anti-emetic; if 
infused as scheduled additional hydration is not required beyond that 
described for HSC infusion in section 6.[ADDRESS_356030] is infused via IV drip directly into the central line without a 
needle or pump at 4-6 mL/minute. 
5. While adverse events are rare based on substantial past experiences 
with MSC, infusional toxicity will be evaluated by [CONTACT_291770]’s vital signs and O2 saturation by [CONTACT_291771].  Infusional toxicity 
will be based on a decrease in oxygen saturation during the infusion 
period.  If there are signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (oxygen saturation 
below 90% off oxygen or shortness of breath), the infusion will be 
discontinued.  Such event will count toward the study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] 
(refer to section 10.4.1). 
6. After the product bag empties (regardless of HSC source or prior 
processing), the bag and IV tubing will be flushed with sterile normal 
saline.  Saline may be either injected directly into the bag or a [ADDRESS_356031] infusion assessments will be done per section 8.2 
 
6.5 Supportive Care 
Supportive care is not specific to patients with EB but to transplant patients in 
general.  For this study, patients will receive Neupogen (G-CSF) 5 mcg/kg/day IV 
based on the actual body weight IV beginning on day +1 after HSC infu sion 
regardless of HSC source.  Neupogen will be administered daily until the ANC 
exceeds 2.5 x 109/L for three consecutive days and then discontinued.  If the 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 31 of 70  proprietary document ANC decreases to <1.0 x 109/L, G-CSF will be reinstituted.  Supportive care 
guidelines, including the management of graft failure and EBV reactivation  with 
or without post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) are detailed in 
institutional SOPs and summarized in Appendix  5. 
 
However, in the event that focal blistering persists, patients may be eligible to 
receive HSC donor derived MSC infusions in an attempt to reduce further 
blistering.  Eligibility and treatment plan are shown below:

biopsies maybe completed as clinically indicated. Standard procedures for these evaluations 
are briefly described below: 
Skin Biopsy  
▪ Alcohol swab is applied to the skin. 
▪ Lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] [1-3 mL] is injected SQ for anesthesia.  
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 35 of 70  proprietary document ▪ 3-4 mm punch biopsies are performed around skin erosions.  
▪ Each of them is closed with a 4- 0 Prolene suture; alternatively 5 mm x 5mm gelfoam “plugs” 
are used for hemostasis. 
▪ Dressings are applied in a manner usual for each patient.  
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Mucosal Biopsy 
• Antibiotics are given before procedure. 
• General anesthesia is introduced. 
• Endoscopic evaluation of stomach and esophagus is performed up to the superior 
esophageal sphincter via a previously placed gastric tube; alternatively oral route may be 
used.  
• 1-2 mm mucosal biopsies are collected from esophagus and stomach (if clinically r equired). 
• Dilatation of esophageal strictures is done using a balloon technique (if indicated).  
1 If clinically indicated  
2 If lab draw outside of window due to blood volume limitations, this will not be considered a deviation from protocol  
3 If patient began protocol prior to incorporation of iscorEB, quality of life survey will continue to be collected; if patie nt began protocol after iscorEB 
added to protocol, this will be collected in place of the quality of life survey (iscorEB is considered standard of care, qua lity of life questionnaire is 
research; iscorEB will be given to patient/parent any  time a skin biopsy is done as standard of care as well)

November 21, 2016 Page 40 of 70  proprietary document 7.6.1 Assessment of Chimerism (also day +28 and +60)  
Skin biopsies will be sent to the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory and the 
proportion of cells derived from the HSC and MSC donors will be 
determined.  Standard methods will be used to distinguish DNA 
polymorphisms unique to the two stem cell donors and host.  In cases 
where there is a sex mismatched HSC or MSC donor, a histological 
section will be further evaluated for the presence of XX and XY by 
[CONTACT_187044]. 
 
7.6.2 Biochemical Assessment 
Protein expression (collagen, laminin, integrin, keratin or plakin) will be 
assessed using standard IF and Western blot assays on biopsy sections 
or cell preparations.

7.6.4 Physical Assessments 
• Assessment of Skin Fragility.   Using negative pressure, time to 
blister formation before and after transplant will be determined.  
As shown in Appendix 6, the device permits an objective 
assessment of blister formation resistance. 
• Photographs.  Total body photographs will be obtained to 
assess changes in degree of blistering and surface area 
involved.  In addition photographs of mouth, stomach and 
esophagus will be obtained at the time of endoscopy via the G 
tube if possible.

overall acute GVHD score based on extent of skin rash, volume of diarrhea and  
maximum bilirubin level.  Patients will be rescored at [ADDRESS_356038] criteria (Appendix 9). 
 
7.9 Sample Storage 
Residual skin biopsy and blood specimens will be cryopreseved for future 
molecular analyses.  Skin biopsy samples and blood samples will be stored at 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 41 of 70  proprietary document the University of Minnesota (Laboratory of Jakub Tolar).  Samples will be stored 
indefinitely.  Samples will only be used for additional analyses to verify correction 
of the EB and engraftment of donor cells, presence of antibody to fe tal calf 
serum, MSC HLA antigens, new protein (collagen, laminin, integrin, plakin), and 
further studies of skin architecture. 
 
 
8 ADVERSE EVENT DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING  
 
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI's Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE).  A copy of the CTCAE can be downlo aded 
from the CTEP home page. 
  (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40 ) 
 
Note:  throughout this section the generic term “drug” refers to the study treatment. 
 
8.1 Definitions 
The following definitions are based on the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 
Part 312.32 (21CFR312.32(a)). 
   
Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction:  Any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  
 
Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reaction:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -
threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurren ce 
places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  
   
Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction :  An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the  
view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse event 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, o r 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropria te 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, [ADDRESS_356039] be evaluated by [CONTACT_291774] 
(21CRF 312.32(a)).  
 
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction : An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severi ty 
that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the ge neral 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.   Thus, 
adverse events that occur as part of the disease process or underlying med ical 
conditions are considered unexpected; however, they will not be reportable per 
section 8.3. 
  
Unanticipated (unexpected) problems/events  as defined by [CONTACT_291775], not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or not part of an underlying 
disease. 
 
Note:   The major discord between the FDA and IRB definitions is whether or not 
the underlying disease is included when considering expectedness. 
 
 
FOR UNLICENSED UCB UNITS ONLY:  Selected expected adverse 
reactions  determined to be caused by [CONTACT_291776]-[ZIP_CODE] (C. Brunstein, MD, PhD – 
sponsor/investigator). Included are the following: 
• The unit is mislabeled or failure to pass local lot release 
• Serious infusion reaction within first 24 hours after infusion 
• Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186185] a 
contaminated UCB within 24 hours after infusion 
 
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]: Federal regulations [45CFR46.103(b)(5) and 21CFR56.108(b)(1)] 
require the IRB to ensure that researchers promptly report “any unanticipated 
problems involving risk to subjects or others” (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104]).   The University of 
Minnesota IRB defines a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_291715], reflects new or increased risk to the 
subjects and at least possibly related  to the research procedures .  
 
In addition, the IRB has defined the following problems/events as reportable  
within 5 working days using the UPRITSO form found on the IRB website: 
MT 2009- 09:  Stem Cell Transplant for EB  
 
   
November 21, 2016 Page 43 of 70  proprietary document • Any accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved protocol that 
increases risk or has the potential to recur  
• Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to a research subject  
• Any publication in the literature, safety monitoring report (including Data and  
Safety Monitoring Reports), interim result or other finding that indicates an 
unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio of the research  
• Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others  
• Any complaint of a subject that cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_16133]  
• Any other possibly related event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_291716] (Rapid) Reporting: Certain events may require rapid notification to 
entities providing patient safety oversight (e.g. IRB, FDA) as detailed in section 
8.3.  For the IRB this is [ADDRESS_356040] of targeted adverse 
events is found in appendix 10. 
 
The targeted toxicity form (appendix 10) will be completed at the foll owing time 
points: 
Day 0:  pre HSCT 
Day 0: pre MSC infusion 
Day 0: [ADDRESS_356041] the worse grade of any targe ted 
toxicity since the MSC infusion, in addition to any unexpected toxicity observed.  
After 4 hours, targeted adverse event data collection will not be done h owever; 
standard of care post-transplant adverse event assessments will continue per 
7.1.1.  From these assessments through day 100,  events deemed unexpe cted, 
regardless of grade, and/or meet the definition of serious will be recorded on the 
study’s case report forms.   
 
Patients also will be closely monitored for excessive toxicity as measured by 
[CONTACT_291777], graft failure and treatment related 
mortality by [CONTACT_4475] 100.  While these events may not necessarily cons titute an

For patients receiving donor MSC infusions > [ADDRESS_356042] the targeted 
toxicity form will be completed at the following time points: 
• pre MSC infusion 
• [ADDRESS_356043] MSC infusion assessment, unless an  
event meets the definition of requiring expedited reporting per section 8.3.  
Transplant related outcomes will continue to be collected as routine by [CONTACT_291778]. 
 
8.3 Required Reporting: IRB, FDA, and MCC SAE Coordinator 
Monitoring and documenting of adverse events will end at day 100; howev er 
after this time point the investigator is obligated, upon knowledge of,  to report 
any adverse event requiring expedited reporting as defined in section 8.1 .  An 
exception to this is the short time frame around the MSC infusion given mo re 
than 6 months after transplant.

[ADDRESS_356045]  
The DSMB is composed of the three External Advisory Panel members 
(appendix 2) who are considered experts in EB, in addition to an expert in 
pediatric blood and marrow transplantation.  The Board members will review the  
clinical and histopathological data at the following specified time points:  
• weeks after first [ADDRESS_356046] been treated 
• weeks after first [ADDRESS_356047] been treated within a specific stratum (ie., 
sibling donor, unrelated marrow donor, unrelated UCB donor) 
• Annually (all strata) 
 
The Board will be asked to assess the safety and efficacy endpoints.  The  DSMB 
will make a recommendation at each time point regarding the appropriaten ess of 
study continuation and whether enrollment should be staggered as defined in  
section 5.[ADDRESS_356048] 5 patients in each stratum. 
 
The DSMB reports will be submitted to the IRB and FDA along with the

• Probability of survival at [ADDRESS_356051] party MSC donor cells in the skin  
and acute GVHD, treating non-event deaths as a competing risk. Ninety-five  
percent confidence intervals will be calculated for all estimates. Descriptive 
statistics will be applied to the quality of life assessments to determine wheth er 
there has been any positive or negative change compared to the pretransplant 
assessment.  Endpoints will be estimated separately for the three different d onor 
types.    
  
10.3 Sample-Size Justification 
A minimum sample size of 25 patients per group (n=75 total) is sufficient t o 
maintain an overall type I error of 5% while providing 80% statistical power. The 
sample size calculation is based on the Simon method using an optimum two -
stage (44). The two-stage design uses a two-step enrollment procedure with  
early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_291721].  
Using 50% event-free survival as unacceptably low and 75% as a rate worthy of

oxygen or shortness of breath), the infusion will be discontinued.  If 3 
patients cannot obtain the complete MSC infusion, the study will be 
stopped. 
 
10.4.2 Graft Failure 
Given a hypothesized graft failure (defined as failing to achieve an ANC 
>500/uL of donor origin by [CONTACT_4475] 42) rate of 10%, a maximum tolerated rate 
of 25% and a maximum sample size of 10 patients, the trial will be 
stopped if: 4/8, 5/14, 6/20 or 7 patients fail to engraft. This has a type I 
error rate of 5% and a power of 80%.

The EAP is composed of three members who are considered expert in EB.  The panel 
members will review the clinical and histopathological data for each prospective patient 
and assess the severity of the EB.  Patients considered to have severe EB, based  on 
biochemical and clinical data as well as self- or parental-assessment of quality of life, 
will be offered therapy. 
 
In addition, panel members will review the clinical and histopathological data for all 
patients annually at the time of the annual IRB review.  Patient demographics and 
identifiers will be removed. 
 
Panel Members: 
John A. McGrath ([EMAIL_5717]) advisory panel chair

November 21, 2016 Page 56 of 70  proprietary document Appendix 5 – Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
1. Anemia  
Transfusions of packed red blood cells are indicated for symptomatic management of an emia.  An 
attempt will be made to maintain the hematocrit >24% and hemoglobin >8 g/d l.  Irradiated (1500-3000 
cCy) blood products will be used.  If CMV negative patient, CMV negative blood products or leukocyte 
poor blood products will be administered.   
 
2. Thrombocytopenia 
Prophylactic platelet transfusions should be given to maintain the platelet count >10,000 m l or above 
the level at which signs of bleeding are known to occur, whichever is greater.  When available,  
autologous stored platelets may be used.  All aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]-containing drugs are to be a voided.  The 
patients should receive no IM nor SQ injections.  Irradiated (1500-3000 cCy) blood produ cts will be 
used.  If CMV negative patient, CMV negative blood products or leukocyte poor blood p roducts will be 
administered. 
 
3. Fever 
Aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic management of fever in the neutropenic patient is mandatory.  
At the onset of fever, the patient will be thoroughly examined and cultured, after wh ich empi[INVESTIGATOR_132327]-
spectrum antibiotics will be initiated. Anti-mold antibiotics should be considered for patients fa iling to 
respond to antibiotics.  Granulocyte transfusions may be given at the investigator's discreti on.  
Irradiation (1500-3000 cCy) of blood products is required. 
 
4. Nutrition 
All patients will be candidates for total parenteral nutrition 
 
5. CSA dose modifications 
To minimize the risk of CSA toxicity, the serum creatinine/BUN will be determined daily for the first 3 0 
days after transplantation.  Subsequently, the frequency will be determined by [CONTACT_42036]'s clinical 
status.  Trough CSA levels will be determined twice weekly for all inpatients with levels obtained on 
the basis of the patients clinical status thereafter.  CSA dose adjustment on the basis of toxicity o r low 
trough level.  The goal is to achieve a CSA trough level of at least 200-400 mg/L witho ut significant 
renal toxicity.   
 
Adjustment of CSA should be based on CSA levels in conjunction with clinical observations of the 
biological effects of the drug, i.e., renal and neurologic toxicity, and the physician's asse ssment of the 
patient's need for immunosuppression.  As a guideline, if the serum creatinine exceeds 2x baseline or 
is >2.0 mg/dL, then the CSA dose should be decreased by 50%; if the serum creatinine exceed s 3x 
baseline or the patient requires hemodialysis, then the CSA dose should be held.  As a  guideline, if 
the patient becomes disoriented or develops visual disturbance, paresis, aphasia or seizure, th e CSA 
dose should be held during the evaluation of the neurological disturbance.  CS A should be 
reinstituted as soon as possible. 
 
6. G-CSF 
All patients will receive G-CSF 5 ug/kg/day IV based on the actual body weight IV beginn ing on day 
+1 after HSC infusion.  G-CSF will be administered daily until the ANC exceeds 2.5 x 109/L for three 
consecutive days and then discontinued.  If the ANC decreases to <1.0 x 109/L, G-CSF will be 
reinstituted.

November 21, [ADDRESS_356065] previously observed an increased incidence specifically in adult 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_291734]50/FLU200/TBI20048.  In 
response to this observation, we monitor patients for EBV reactivation with planned earl y intervention 
using Rituximab, anti-CD20 antibody, to eradicate the infected B cell population.  W hile the incidence 
of this complication has been lower than in this initial report48, Rituximab is a generally accepted 
treatment strategy when rising titers of EBV are detected or PTLD has been diagnosed. 
 
 Monitoring .  EBV PCR is assessed every 2 weeks between days 30 and 180 after transplant.   
If PCR is positive (>  1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_291735] ) the patient will be 
evaluated for adenopathy by [CONTACT_291784], abdome n and 
pelvis.   
 
Treatment . If the diagnosis is EBV reactivation only with PTLD, the patient will receive 
Rituximab with frequent monitoring thereafter according to institutional practice.  If there is a 
adenopathy, the patient will receive Rituximab with or without chemotherapy depending  upon 
the extent of disease, results of the lymph node biopsy, and other active problems relate d to 
the transplant.

To assess skin fragility after transplant, gentle negative pressure is applied to the skin.  
In normal individuals, blister formation takes up to [ADDRESS_356066] mutations in both alleles.  It is 
hypothesized that biochemical correction of severe EB will result in increasing 
resistance to the negative pressure and a prolongation in time before blister formatio n 
occurs.

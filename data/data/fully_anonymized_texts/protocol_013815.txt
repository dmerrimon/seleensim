1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Reduction of Risk Factors for ACL Re -injuries using an Innovative 
Biofeedback Approach   
Study Des cription : ACL injuries are common among athletes and due to residual 
muscle weakness, limited knee motion and asymmetrical 
movement patterns after surgery many of these athletes will 
sustain secondary ACL injuries following return to sports. This 
project seeks to determine if a novel biofeedback -based 
rehabilitation approach can decrease a known risk factor for 
secondary injuries to the ACL. The project specifically focuses on 
correcting asymmetric movement patterns, a known risk factor for 
secondary injury that is not directly addressed by [CONTACT_760013] a 6 week therapy based biofeedback 
intervent ion.

 Primary Objective :  Determine the impact of a biofeedback training 
program on decreasing asymmetrical vertical ground reaction 
forces, frontal plane knee range of motion and the peak knee 
extension moment, known risk factors for secondary ACL injuries.   
  
 Secondary Objectives :   To demonstrate our ability to recruit, retain 
and determine patient compliance in completing a biofeedback 
retraining program.   
Endpoints:  Primary Endpoint  for Objective 1 : 
Peak Knee Extension Moment Symmetry  
 
Secondary Endpoints  for Objective 1:  
Peak Vertical Ground Reaction Force Symmetry  
Vertical Ground Reaction Force Impulse Symmetry  
Frontal Plane Knee Range of Motion 
Peak Knee Flexion Angle Symmetry  
Peak Knee Flexion Angle

Primary Endpoints for Objective 2:  
Number of intervention sessions attended (compliance)  
Number of missed biomechanical assessment time points 
(retention)   
Study Population:  The target sample for this study will include patients between the 
ages of 14 and 21, who had a primar y ACL reconstruction by [CONTACT_760014] (Southwest Virginia) and plan to return 
to sport participation. We will be recruiting both men and women 
for this study with no specific gender breakdown.    
Phase:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_759981] /Facilities 
Enrolling Participants:  This is a single site study for the intervention and testing of 
enrolled subjects.  Four referring physicians will be referring 
potential participants from a 60- mile radius around Blacksburg, 
Virginia.    
Description of  Study 
Intervention:  This will be a randomized controlled Phase 1, pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833].  
Patients will be assigned to one of two study arms:  1) Biofeedback 
Intervention, 2) Attention Control.  All participants in the study will 
continue with any other usual medical care they receive for their 
ACL reconstruction.  
 
BIOFEEDBACK INTERVENTION  
The 6- week biofeedback training program is focused on altering 
loading and movement asymmetry during biweekly sessions on 
non-consecutive days (12 sessions). The biofeedback training 
program will provide sensory (visual and tactile) feedback to the 
subject  to heighten awareness of asymmetrical movement 
strategies (e.g. load shift, movement asymmetry) during a squat. 
The two exercises that will be completed during the biofeedback 
training program will be a visual feedback squat and a resisted 
squat (tactile feedback).  Each of these tasks will be completed 30 
(3 sets of 10 repetitions) times per session.  We will provide a [ADDRESS_1040729] between trials, and a 10 minute break between the

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_1040730] of 
fatigue.  
 
ATTENTION CONTROL  
The 6- week attention control group program will focus on providing 
educational information to the participants related to the clinical 
and sports expectations as they are released to return to sport.  
These participants will be asked to  meet 6 times during the 6- week 
intervention time period.  Three of these visits will be completed in 
person and three will be completed using an online educational 
module (6 sessions).  The online sessions will be completed in 
week 1, week 3, and week 5 w hile the in person sessions will be 
completed during week 2, week 4, and week 6.  The content of 
these sessions will focus on providing information on ACL 
reconstruction, athlete expectation as they return to sport, 
incidence and risk factors for secondary  ACL injuries, as well as 
some suggestions on the gradual progression back into sport.   
Study Duration:  The estimated study duration is [ADDRESS_1040731] patient until the completion of data analysis.   
Participant Duration:  All pa rticipant visits will be completed in approximately 3 months 
(12 weeks) from the date of enrollment until all study visits are 
completed.

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
Nearly 1 in 60 adolescent athletes will suffer an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury1,27, at 
an estimated annual cost of $[ADDRESS_1040732] been ineffective at returning athletes to sport while decreasing re -tear rates. This is 
confirmed in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons’ A CL return to sport 
guidelines, which state a need for restoration of movement, but do not provide objective 
measures of assessment. 5,16,[ADDRESS_1040733] been associated with an increase in 
secondary ACL injury risk following return to sport. Thus, to decrease the risk for secondary 
ACL injuries, there is a pressing need to evaluate novel interventions that improve lower 
extremity movement patterns and restore movement and loading symmetry prior to release to 
return to full sport participation.  
 
Our preliminary data indicate that through the use of a biofeedback intervention we can 1) 
reduce risk factors for secondary ACL injury (reduce asymmetrical ground reaction forces, 
joint angles, and joint moments) one week after the completion of the intervention and 2) 
subjects are willing  to attend biofeedback training sessions. This intervention provides 
simultaneous visual and tactile biofeedback as patients complete a single body weight task 
(squat) to alter landing mechanics.  Retraining the single body -weight task allows for training 
in a less ballistic, more controlled environment to restore neuromuscular function. We will 
complete a randomized trial (control versus biofeedback) using adolescent ACL patients and 
three -dimensional motion capture (1) to determine the impact of a novel biofeedback training 
program on decreasing secondary ACL injury risk factors (movement and loading 
asymmetry32), and (2) to establish our ability to recruit and retain patients while assessing 
intervention compliance and the psychometric characteristics of the outcome measures.  
 
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
ACL Injury and Re- injury:  As many as 200,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are 
diagnosed annually in the [LOCATION_002]1,27, and almost all affected patients (94%) seek to 
restore joint stabilit y by [CONTACT_760015][INVESTIGATOR_560903] 1.0 
Protocol <IRB# 17 -007>  27 October 2020 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   7 of $[ADDRESS_1040734] patients receiving ACL reconstruction are adolescents 
between the ages of 15 and 3033, many seek to return fully to sports after rehabilitation.  
Unfortunately, doctors’ return -to-play decisions do not usually rely on objective measures of 
function5,6; instead, the decision is most often based on time, typi[INVESTIGATOR_759982]4-6,16,30. We and others have shown that athletes who are returned to spor t based 
on current guidelines have residual muscle imbalances, muscle weakness, and altered lower 
extremity mechanics, and these deficiencies can be detected up to two years post -
surgery14,16,30.  
 
Athletes returned to sport prior to appropriate restoration of function are at a greater risk for 
secondary ACL tears, defined as tears of the ACL graft or contralateral intact ACL. 
Secondary tears of the ACL are surprisingly common: despi[INVESTIGATOR_759983]- injury sport participation, up to 29% of all ACL r econstruction patients suffer a 
secondary tear. In slightly different terms, one study has shown a [ADDRESS_1040735] been returned to full sport participation. Thus, 
secondary ACL injuries are a significant problem that is largely influenced by [CONTACT_760016].  
 
The Biofeedback Approach to Recovery: Our proposed biofeedback approach has its 
foundation in retraining programs that were developed and implemented for primary ACL 
injury prevention. These retraining programs are designed to alter lower extremity mechanics 
through retraining landing mechanics, a very dynamic and complex task.[ADDRESS_1040736] proven effective for primar y ACL tears: they decrease the risk factors for injury,20,28,29,[ADDRESS_1040737]: it will provide 
the first retraining program that directly targets and effectively decreases known risk factors 
for secondary ACL injury risk factors.  
 
Significance of our Approach: With the large proportion and increased incidence of ACL tears 
in adolescent athletes, it is imperative that we develop interventions to decrease the risk of 
secondary injuries and improve outcomes. Therefore, the goals of the proposed study  are 
to determine the immediate impact of a biofeedback training program on decreasing risk 
factors for secondary ACL tears and determine if the impact is retained [ADDRESS_1040738] -operative rehabilitation paradi gm to include the assessment and normalization of

ultimately decrease both health care costs associated with ACL injuries and the number of 
patients suffering secondary ACL tears.  
 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
There is a potential risk that participants  could injure his/her  foot, ankle, or knee or feel off 
balance while completing these tasks; however, the study team  will ensure that the testing area 
is clean and free of debris.  The risk again will be no greater than if the participant  were 
performing these tasks on his/her  own and are no more difficult than the sporting tasks that the 
participant’s  physician has allowed you to start doing during sport participation or what the 
participant  would be doing at this point during physical therapy.  There is a potential risk to the 
participant’s  confidentiality.  Every effort will be made to maintain his/her  confidentiality, 
however this cannot be guaranteed.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1040740] benefits to the participant  if he/she decides  to participate in this 
research project. The participant will receiv e additional one- on-one exercise training as well as 
an explanation of his/her  movement mechanics at the completion of the last day of testing if the 
participant is  interested. Research c onducted on these data may help researchers to better 
understand how visual and tactile biofeedback change the way that ACL reconstruction patients  
move and if these exercises are able to decrease the risk factors for secondary ACL injuries 
after patients  return to sport participation.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1040741] not been approved by [CONTACT_5657]/her treati ng orthopaedic surgeon and that are not appropriate for 
the participant’s current stage in rehabilitation. The results from this study could alter post -
operative rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction leading to a decrease in the number of 
secondary A CL injuries following return to sports.

biofeedback training program on 
decreasing asymmetrical peak knee 
extension moment.   
 
 Peak Knee Extension Moment 
Symmetry  
 
  
 Peak knees extension moment 
asymmetry between the operative and 
non-operative side is a known risk 
factors for secondary ACL injuries  and 
is therefore being used as the primary 
outcome to determine the ability of the 
biofeedback intervention to decrease a 
risk factor for secondary ACL injury 
risk.    
Secondary    
To demonstrate our ability to recruit, 
retain and determine patient 
compliance in completing a 
biofeedback retraining program.  
 • Number of intervention sessions 
attended (compliance)  
 
• Number of missed 
biomechanical assessment time 
points (retention)  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_759984] a future multi -
center clinical trial.  
Tertiary/ Exploratory    
Determine the impact of a 
biofeedback training program on 
decreasing asymmetrical vertical 
ground reaction forces, frontal plane 
knee range of motion and the 
association between each of these 
measures and the change in the 
peak knee extension moment 
symmetry.   
 Exploratory Endpoints :  
• Peak Vertical Ground Reaction 
Force Symmetry  
• Vertical Ground Reaction Force 
Impulse Symmetry  
• Frontal Plane Knee Range of 
Motion  
• Peak Knee Flexion Angle 
Symmetry  
• Peak Knee Flexion Angle  
• Peak Knee Valgus  The peak knee extension moment is a 
known risk factor for secondary ACL 
injury risk, however, it is challenging to 
collect this measure in a clinical setting 
as it requires the collection of 
synchronized three- dimensional 
kinematic and kinetic data.  Therefore, 
these exploratory endpoints will be 
assessed to determine their 
association with the change in 
symmetry in the peak knee extension 
moment.  Through this analysis we 
hope to be able to identify additional 
measures to use in assessing this 
biofeedback intervention that will be 
more easily implemented in the clinical 
setting.

(immediately following training (efficacy), and 6 weeks after (durability)) the biofeedback training 
program ( Aim 1 ; Figure 1).  
 
40 adolescent ACL patients (20 control, 20 intervention) will be recruited. Subjects will be block 
randomized into either the control arm or the intervention arm at baseline.  All intervention 
subjects will complete an in- person (no home exercises) biofeedback retraining program for 6 
weeks (2 times per week) with a foc us on improving both load and movement symmetry through 
the use of tactile and visual feedback ( Figure 1 ), which has been reported to be an effective

engage them in the novel biofeedback program, and retain them until study completion.  The 
outcomes from Aim 2  will inform future study designs.

5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Recruitment:  
The target sample for this study will include patients between the ages of [ADDRESS_1040748] -operative 
physical therapy and be released by [CONTACT_5657]/her treating orthopaedic surgeon to return to full sport 
participation.  
 
Based on our prior and ongoing studies, we are confident that [ADDRESS_1040749] 
an ACL reconstruction with any of the referring orthopaedic surgeons. The medical records will 
be used to determine eligibility based on study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The parents, if 
the patient is a minor, of all potentially eligible patients will be approached by [CONTACT_760019]’s clinical staff. If the patient is over the age of 
18, he/she will be approached directly by [CONTACT_760020]. The three referring 
physicians have been working with the research study team on the r ecruitment and enrollment 
of ACL reconstruction patients for the last [ADDRESS_1040750]’s interest in 
participation.  
 
Retention:  
All participants will be treated with respect, and we will be consider ate of the time and energy 
that is involved with participation in this study.  Participant retention will begin with the 
recruitment process.  Based on medical records and release of information consent forms from 
the treating physician, only those patient s who do not actively opt out will be contact[CONTACT_760021] -up information about the study and assess their interest in participating.  Once 
enrolled in the study, all participants will have contact [CONTACT_760022] (baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks). In addition, based on group randomization the 
participants will also have contact [CONTACT_760023] a week for six weeks or 
once a week for six weeks. Based on our prior experience, this level o f contact [CONTACT_760024].  Calls to participants will also be scheduled at times that are preferred 
and convenient for each participant.  We will also use telephone calls to remind participants 
about all in- person study visits.  Partici pants not assigned to patient intervention arm will be

Participant recruitment and retention statistics will be collected and monitored on a regular basis 
such that any problems or negative trends can be identified early and appropriate measures 
taken and/or procedures modified.  
 
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
 
This will be a randomized controlled Phase 1, pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833].  Patients will be assigned to one 
of two study arms:  1) Biofeedback Intervention, 2) Attention Control.  All participants in the 
study will continue with any other usual medical care they receive for their ACL reconstruction.  
 
BIOFEEDBACK INTERVENTION  
The 6- week biofeedback training program is focused on altering loading and movement 
asymmetry during biweekly sessions on non- consecutive days (12 sessions). The biofeedback 
training program will provide sensory (visual and tactile) feedback t o the subject to heighten 
awareness of asymmetrical movement strategies (e.g. load shift, movement asymmetry) during 
a squat. The two exercises that will be completed during the biofeedback training program will 
be a visual feedback squat and a resisted squat (tactile feedback).  Each of these tasks will be 
completed 30 (3 sets of 10 repetitions) times per session.  We will provide a [ADDRESS_1040752]  of fatigue. Prior to the biofeedback intervention session, each participant will 
complete a 5 -minute warmup on a stationary bike as was described during the biomechanical 
assessments.  
 
Visual feedback : The simplest way to provide biofeedback during a squat is through visual 
feedback of load. Under this approach, subjects are asked to stand on force plates, which 
measure the ground reaction forces (load) beneath each foot. Shoulder width for each 
partic ipant will be measured as the distance between acromioclavicular joints.  This distance will 
then be measured on the force plates and 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_759987] 
(one on each force plate) and participants will be asked to stand with  one heel on each pi[INVESTIGATOR_759988].  Stance width will be recorded on the data collection sheet and then entered into REDCap 
so that this distance can be used during each subsequent training and testing session and foot 
position can be measured and marked pr ior to participant arrival.  Participants  face a projection 
screen that displays two bar graphs of the vertical ground reaction force, depi[INVESTIGATOR_759989]’s

plate) with their hands in front on them with the shoulder flexed to [ADDRESS_1040753]’s  thigh will be parallel to the ground if they sat down (stool will be 
placed at the height of the popliteal fold) , so that the subject will know the deepest position they 
have to achieve. If the subject is able to achieve a squat position where the thigh i s parallel to 
the floor they will be instructed to squat until they barely touch down on the bench and then 
slowly stand back up without transferring any weight to the bench. Subjects are asked to squat 
down and watch the change in load beneath each foot. After completing the first squat, subjects 
will be asked to complete all subsequent squats with the goal of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_759990] a LSI ≥ 90% (symmetric) load on both feet. This process will 
be completed a total of  30 times (3 sets of 10 repetitions each) during each of the training 
sessions with the same goal each time of maintaining the bars at an equal level. This is a simple 
measure that subject can easily understand and that can be altered through biofeedback.24  
 
Tactile feedback:  The second set of exercises at each biofeedback session will be resisted 
squats. A subject will be asked to squat while an external force is applied to the side of the knee 
(Figure 3) requiring the subject to work against this resistance to maintain balance and complete 
the squat. The band will be placed on the surgical limb of each patient and will be pulled at 
approximately a [ADDRESS_1040754] the 
non-operative limb (one that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_759991]) will require the subject to pull 
toward the surgical limb and maintain good frontal plane position by [CONTACT_760025]. This is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_759992]. The squat position that will be used during these exercises will be the same as 
the squat position used in both the visual biofeedback task as well as during the biomechanical 
testing. The subjects will be asked to stand with their feet at the standardized width and again 
squat until they make contact [CONTACT_760026]. Subjects will be asked to complete 30 tactile feedback squats (3 sets of 10 
squats) during each of the biofeedback sessions.  
 
ATTENTION CONTROL  
The 6- week attention control group program will focus on providing educational information to 
the participants related to the clinical and sports expectations as they are released to return to 
sport.  These participants will be asked to m eet 6 times during the 6 -week intervention time 
period.  Three of these visits will be completed in person and three will be completed using an 
online educational module (6 sessions).  The online sessions will be completed in week 1, week 
3, and week 5 whi le the in person sessions will be completed during week 2, week 4, and week 
6.  The content of these sessions will focus on providing information on ACL reconstruction, 
athlete expectation as they return to sport, incidence and risk factors for secondary A CL injuries, 
as well as some suggestions on the gradual progression back into sport.    
6.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
 
The dose for each participant will be dependent on the group to which he/she is randomized.  
However, the dose will be the same for all partic ipants in the Biofeedback Intervention as well 
as being the same between all participants in the Attention Control arm of the study.

DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
Discontinuation from the ACL Biofeedback intervention does not mean discontinuation from the ACL 
Biofeedback Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_17143].   If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from 
baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in 
participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be repo rted as an adverse 
event (AE).  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• At the time of discontinuation an AE or SAE report will be completed and submitted to the IRB 
as well as to KAI per the information included in the MOOP (Section 10.0 Safety Reporting).  
 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUDY  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participa nt from  the study for the following 
reasons : 
 
• Pregnancy  
• Significant study intervention non-compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), or other medical condition or situation occurs such 
that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation 
• Study participant sustains an ACL tear of either limb  
• Participant unable to  attend the ACL Biofeedback intervention session for 2 days/weeks  
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the 
Case Report Form ( CRF) (MOOP Appendix K) . Subjects who sign the informed consent form

visit: 
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_760028] t within 1 
week of the missed visit  and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue 
in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls  will 
be made to the participant ). These contact [CONTACT_760029].  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of  lost to follow -up. 
 
[ADDRESS_1040760] -operative recovery (physician release letter) as well as providing the patient's 
confirmation that they approval the release of their information (patient release of information) 
so that they are able to be contact[CONTACT_760030]’s interest in 
participating in the study.  
 
Based on our prior and ongoing studies, we are confident that 40 participants can be enrolled 
within the 24 month recruitment period. Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_5657]/her treating orthopaedic 
surgeon as being appropriate for study enrollment at approximately 4.[ADDRESS_1040761] in study participation and the patient has provided signed consent for 
release of information, the medical records will be reviewed by a member of the study team to 
determine enrollment eligibility based on study inclusion and exclusion criteria. All potentially 
eligible patients (parents if the patient is a minor) will be approached by [CONTACT_760031]’s clinical staff. If the patient is over the age of 18, he/she will 
be approached directly by [CONTACT_760020]. During this discussion, the treating 
surgeon will explain the activities to be completed during the study and will provide the patient 
with documentation that the surgeon believes the patient is medically appropriate for study 
enrollment. The referring physicians have been working with the research study team on the 
recruitment and enrollment of ACL reconstruction patients for the last year on an industry 
ACL Biofeedback Pi[INVESTIGATOR_560903] 1.0 
Protocol <IRB# 17 -007>  27 October 2020 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_1040762].  
 
Prior to the start of the study, all participants (and parents will complete parental permission and 
patient will complete ascent if participant is <18 years old) will complete informed consent in 
person in the lab. The consent form will be sent to the potential participant by [CONTACT_760032]'s preference prior to study enrollment. Potential participants (parents if the 
potenti al participant is a minor) will be allowed to review the consent form prior to his/her first 
visit to the lab. Each participant will be allowed ample time to review the consent form and 
determine if he/she is interested in participating in the study. All questions will be answered prior 
to the consent form being signed and the study being initiated. If a consented subject becomes 
18 during the course of the study he/she will be consented as an adult at the next study visit.  
 
Following administration of the consent and HIPAA authorization, we will measure height and 
weight and determine BMI. If female participants become pregnant, their active involvement in 
the study will end because later stage pregnancy will alter movement mechanics due to 
increased joint  laxity.  In addition, weight gain would also likely confound study results.  As part 
of the telephone screening process, women will be excluded if they self -report being pregnant or 
planning to become pregnant.  
 
We will aim to ensure that subject selecti on is equitable and all relevant demographic groups 
have access to study participation by [CONTACT_760033] / exclusion 
criteria, regardless of demographic characteristics.  We have also aimed to produce recruitment 
and intervention materials that are appropriate for individuals with low literacy or education 
levels.  We will continue to recruit patients until we reach our sample size goal of n=40.  
 
Screening questionnaire data will be entered directly into the study database.  We w ill have 
paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_759995].  We anticipate this will be rare.  However, if paper forms are needed, data will then be 
entered as soon as possible.  Any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_759996] w ill be stored in the subject’s 
individual study folders which are kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office of a study team 
member.  
 
Subject data for all subjects enrolled in the study will be entered into a secure computerized 
enrollment log.  This  data will be accessible only to study personnel needing access to fulfill 
their study related duties.  
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1040763] will be asked to 
complete an initial biomechanical assessment in the Kevin P. Granata Biomechanics Lab at 
Virginia Tech. All subjects will be asked to wear form fitting shorts and a shirt, plus a pair of 
athletic shoes (Nike Pegasus, Nike Inc, Beaverton, CO) all of which will be provided for them to 
use during testing (Figure 2). Previous literature has shown that differences in footwear can 
alter the ground reaction forces.35,[ADDRESS_1040764] design comparing two

warm up by [CONTACT_244260] a stationary bike at a comfortable pace for [ADDRESS_1040765] retro-
reflective markers attached at specific locations on both lower extremities to track segmental 
motion during both squatting and landing.  Three -dimensional coordinate data will be collected 
using a 10- camera motion capture system at a sampling rate of 120 Hz (Qualysis, Sweden). 
Ground reaction forces will be collected using 2 embedded force plates at a sampling rate of 
2400 Hz (AMTI, Watert own, [LOCATION_005]). Each subject will be asked to complete a standing 
trial followed by a series of squatting and landing trials as described below:  
 
Squatting trial : Subjects will be asked to complete 15 bilateral squats.  Subjects will be asked to 
stand with their feet shoulder width apart (one foot on each force plate) with their hands in front 
on them with the shoulder flexed to [ADDRESS_1040766]’s thigh will be parallel to the 
ground if they sat down  (the stool will be placed at the height of the popliteal fold) , so that the 
subject will know the deepest position they have to achieve. The stool will be placed within 0.[ADDRESS_1040767] same setup and protocol will 
be used for the biofeedback training program and obtain a baseline measure of skill during a 
squat.  Upon completion of the squatting trials, subjects will be asked to complete 10 vertical 
stop- jump tasks. The stop- jump task was selected based on its game -like nature. The stop -jump 
task is a good simulation of a basketball jump -shot or heading a soc cer ball and therefore could 
produce loads and movements that are closely related to those seen during game play.       
 
Landing trial:  Subjects will be asked to complete [ADDRESS_1040768] for up to 5 steps taking off on 1 foot, 
landing on 2 feet (one foot on each force plate), and taking off agai n on 2 feet.16,18,20,21 Prior to 
testing maximum jump height will be determine using a vertec. During testing, a ball will be hung 
above the force plates at 75% of the subject’s maxmum jump height to provide a target during 
jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Subjects will be instru cted to jump up and grab the ball and then come down bilaterally 
on the two force plates.   No instructions will be provided on how to land or what to do with their 
arms to initiate the jump. The stop- jump task will be used to determine if the biofeedback 
intervention is effective at decreasing secondary ACL risk factors as these risk factors were 
determined during landing. Subjects will be allowed to practice the task between 3 and 5 times 
until they are comfortable with the movement. A minimum of 5 minutes’ rest will be given 
between conditions to minimize the effects of fatigue.  If the results of the baseline jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_759997] a limb symmetry index (LSI) of greater than or equal 
to 90%, which is indicative of limb symmetry  during hoppi[INVESTIGATOR_759998], he/she will be

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
 
Adverse Event (AE) – Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a clinical researc h 
study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the 
research, whether or not considered related to participation in the r esearch.  
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
 
An adverse event ( AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards  
 
Impor tant medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following 
guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s 
daily activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a l ow level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Sever e events are usually potentially life- threatening or

• Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibi lity means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Probably Related –  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time 
after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
diagnosis.  
• Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The study clinician and the principle investigator in consultation will be responsible for 
determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk information previously described for the study intervention.  
 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT  AND FOLLOW- UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE)  may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured 
on the case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study  product (assessed by [CONTACT_106492] ), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must 
be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate 
resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The study principle investigator and either of the research assistants  will record all reportable 
events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non-
serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study partici pation.  At each study visit, 
the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be 
followed for outcome information unt il resolution or stabilization.

All AEs are collected, analyzed, and monitored by [CONTACT_514513] ( MOOP 
Appendix G). AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities identified in the protocol as critical to 
participant safety will be reported to the NIAMS and the safety officer. All AEs experienced by a 
participant during the time frame specified in the protocol (from the initial day of testing as well 
as the initiation of the biofeedback program through the end of the study) will be reported, as 
outlined in the protocol (Section 1a of the MOOP).  
 
The procedure for col lecting and reporting AEs will be detailed in the following sections.  This 
information will include the role of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_117404] ([CONTACT_760053] K. Miller) in assigning severity and defining the relationship between the AE and the 
study intervention.  A sample AE form can be found in Appendix G.  Requirements for reporting 
AEs to the NIAMS and the study’s independent Safety Officer (SO)) is described below.  
 
The Principal Investigator (PI) and study staff members will be responsible for the safety of 
study participants.  It is not anticipated that there will be any significant physical or psychological 
risks associated with this study.  However, federal regulations require prompt reporting to the 
Virginia Tech Institutional Rev iew Board (IRB), all injuries, adverse events, or other 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others that occur in the course of a 
subject’s participation in this research study.

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all  of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or pos sibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places par ticipants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
 
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB). The UP  report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB 
project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following 
timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs)  will be reported to the IRB, the Safety 
Officer a nd the NIAMS, through the NIAMS contractor within 48 hours of being reported 
to the Investigator.  The immediate reports will be followed by [CONTACT_12908], written reports as 
soon as possible as follow up information may be required before a written report can be 
provided.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_760001]’s 
NAIMS safety officer on a biannual basis.   
• Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB and the Safety Officer and the NIAMS, through 
the NIAMS contractor within 10 business days if a protocol deviation/violation, or other 
unanticipated problem .  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_8706]’s written reporting procedures), the Safety Officer and the NIAMS, t hrough the

9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
 
The following populations will be included in the statistical analysis : 
 
• Modified Intention- to-Treat Analysis Dataset ( participant s who completed at least 50% of 
the intervention visits in the Biofeedback Arm of the study and who attended at least one 
of the post -intervention assessment visits)  
• Safety Analysis Dataset: defines the subset of participant s for whom safety analyses will 
be conducted ( participant s who completed at least intervention visit ) 
• Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset: defines a subset of the participant s in the full analysis 
(ITT) s et who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data would be 
likely to represent the effects of study intervention according to the underlying scientific 
model ( participant s who completed at least 80% of the study intervention visits ) 
• Other Datasets  that may be used for sensitivity analyses  
 
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
• For descriptive statistics  the results will be reported as percentages as well as means 
and standard deviations as appropriate for the measure.  C ategorical  data will be 
reported as percentages while continuous data will be reported as  means with standard 
deviations  as well as data ranges .  
• For inferential tests, indicate the p -value and confidence intervals for statistical 
significance (Type I error) and whether one or two -tailed.  
• Checks for the assumption  of normality will be performed prior to additional statistical 
procedures .  If this assumption is not met then corrective procedures  will be applied  
such as transformation or nonparametric tests  as appropriate .

be the knee extension moment l imb symmetry index (LSI).  The previously established 
movement asymmetry risk factors32 and therefore the primary measures of interest are the knee 
extension moment, vertical ground reaction force, and frontal plane knee range of motion. 
Symmetry between the operative and non- operative limbs in this study will be determined by 
[CONTACT_760036] (LSI). Asymmetry in the peak knee extension moment has 
been identified as significant predic tors of secondary ACL injuries (therefore reduction in this 
asymmetry will decrease the risk for secondary ACL injuries).[ADDRESS_1040776] repeated measures assessment (ANOVA), as 
implemented under mixed models , will be used to determine if a clinical (LSI>90%) and/or 
statistical difference exists between the pre - and the two post -intervention time points (efficacy 
and durability) for the primary outcome of interest  (knee extension moment asymmetry) . Post -
hoc tes ting will be completed for any variable that is determined to be statistically different.

session (baseline, immediately following intervention (intervention)/6 weeks after baseline 
(control), and then 6 weeks after training (intervention) or 12 week after the  baseline (control). 
Proportion retention will be computed by [CONTACT_760037].  Compliance with the 
intervention will be defined as a subject who attends at least 80% of the biofeedback training 
sessions during the six weeks of the intervention.  Proportion adherence will be computed by 
[CONTACT_760038] (number of 
training sessions n= 12).

Monthly reports will describe target and actual enrollment by [CONTACT_166351], individuals 
screened with reasons for screen failure, and enrollment status (enrolled, active, completed, 
discontinued treatment, and lost to follow -up). Monthly reports w ill also list or summarize AEs 
and SAEs. Administrative reports will list the forms completed, entered, and missing, and/or 
erroneous data and forms. The NIAMS has requested a monthly study update to be provided on 
the fifth of every month by [CONTACT_9154].  Reports to the Safety Officer (SO) will be completed

[IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of 
the principle  investigator . The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data.  Most of the source data for this clinical trial will be collected directly in an 
electronic REDCap database to avoid issues with data entry and imp rove speed of data 
collection for the participants.

the data recorded on the source documents .  
 
Clinical data (including a dverse events ( AEs), concom itant medications, and expected adverse 
reactions dat a) will be entered into REDCap , a [ADDRESS_1040787] protection and internal quality 
checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, 
or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1040788] approval of a 
marketing application in an International Conference on Harminosation ( ICH) region and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least [ADDRESS_1040789] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study 
intervention . These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by 
[CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the NIAMS , if 
applicable. It is the responsibi lity of the NIAMS  to inform the investigator when these documents 
no longer need to be retained.  
 
10.1.10  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International 
Conference on Harmonisation G ood Clinical Practice ( ICH GCP) , or Manual of Operations and 
Procedures  (MOOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the 
participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions 
are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP :  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.[ADDRESS_1040790] (IRB)  per their 
policies . The site investigator  is responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB 
requirements. Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the 
MOOP.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1040791] regarding baseline measures, as these become availabl e.  We will perform regular data 
cleaning throughout the study so that analyses of main study outcomes may begin very shortly 
after these assessments are completed.  The study team will follow guidelines for authorship as 
recommended by [CONTACT_410014] C ommittee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).  We expect

Protocol <IRB# 17 -007>  27 October 2020 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   36 that manuscripts describing main study outcomes will involve authorship of all study co -
investigators (as long as ICMJE criteria are met).  Other manuscripts must be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_760046], at minimum, before 
submission.  
 
In compliance with the current NIH policy to ensure public access to NIH funded research all 
publications will be submitted in an electronic format upon acceptance fo r any publications that 
result from research supported, in whole or in part by [CONTACT_760047]. The final 
manuscript is defined as the final version accepted for journal publication, and includes all 
modifications from the publishing peer revi ew process.  
 
In compliance with the NIH policy, electronic submission will be made directly to the NIH 
National Library of Medicine's (NLM) PubMed Central (PMC): 
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov. PMC is the NIH digital repository of full -text, peer -review ed 
biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research journals. It is a publicly -accessible, stable, 
permanent, and searchable electronic archive.  
At the time of submission, the author will specify the timing of the posting of her final manuscript 
for public accessibility through PMC. Posting for public accessibility through PMC is requested 
and strongly encouraged as soon as possible (and within twelve months of the publisher's 
official date of final publication).  
 
The publisher may choose to furnish PMC with the publisher's final version, which will 
supersede the author's final version. Also, if the publisher agrees, public access to the 
publisher's final version in PMC can occur sooner than the timing originally specified by [CONTACT_760048]'s final  version.

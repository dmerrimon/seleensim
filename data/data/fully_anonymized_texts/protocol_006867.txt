  INTRODUCTION  Myofascial pain is a common disorder affecting individuals across the general population and in specific populations, such as athletes, resulting in compromised function, performance, and productivity (Muller et al., 2014).  It has been associated with many pain conditions including tension-type headache, spi[INVESTIGATOR_481283], and neck and shoulder pain (Muller et al., 2014; Simons &  Travell, 1981). Myofascial pain characteristically results from hyperirritable nodules of muscle (trigger points or tender points) associated with pain in affected regions of the body (Jafri, 2014).  These areas within the muscle are subjected to continued contraction of muscle fibers due to “too much” calcium resulting in compromised oxygenation of the muscle tissue (Dommerholt et al., 2006). These hyperirritable nodules often occur in fatigued muscles that are subjected to imbalanced postural positions, such as the forward head and rounded shoulders postures (JG &  SH, 1983). It can also occur from repetitive movements commonly seen in athletics, and individuals performing manual work (Borg-Stein &  Simons, 2002).  Positional release therapy (PRT) and therapeutic massage (TM) are methods used to treat trigger or tender points (D'Ambrogio &  Roth, 1997; Knight &  Draper, 2013; Wong, 2012). Separate studies on each method have shown efficacy in reducing pain (Aboodarda et al., 2015; Mohammadi Kojidi et al., 2016) muscle tightness (Kelencz et al., 2011) and improving joint mobility (D'Ambrogio &  Roth, 1997).  PRT is a manual therapeutic technique that first locates tender points within a muscle. Once identified, the practitioner places the muscle in a passively shortened position, while applying slight pressure (D'Ambrogio &  Roth, 1997). TM involves the manipulation of soft tissue using techniques such as effleurage and petrissage, to restore blood flow and oxygenation of the muscle tissue (Tessier, 2005; Yang et al., 2012).   
Various methods have previously been used to find and assess severity of tender or trigger points. Among those commonly used are the pressure pain algometer with pressure pain threshold (PPT), range of motion electromyography and visual analog scales (VAS) (Aboodarda et al., 2015; Buttagat et al., 2012; Draper, 2015; Ghanbari et al., 2012; Kelencz et al., 2011; Nagrale et al., 2010; Simons &  Travell, 1981; Sweety et al., 2014; Wong, 2012). Some studies have also utilized B-mode (two-dimensional) ultrasound imaging (US) to locate, define, trace, and quantify myofascial trigger points after palpation providing a useful means of quantification (Cojocaru MC, 2015; Kumbhare DA, 2016; Muller et al., 2014). Shear wave elastography ultrasound (SWE) has been used to calculate the elastic modulus (tissue stiffness) of muscle reliably, (Brandenburg et al., 2014; Eby [CONTACT_2297]., 2013; Gennisson et al., 2010; Kumbhare DA, 2016; Muller et al., 2014), but has not been used quantify changes within trigger points following treatment.   Objectives  The purpose of our study was to quantify the effectiveness of PRT or TM at reducing pain, trigger point tenderness, and muscle stiffness in the upper trapezius muscle by [CONTACT_2329] a combination of the visual analog scale, PPT, B-mode US and SWE to assess changes within triggers points.  
  METHODS    Participants  We recruited 60 healthy Participants, 24 males and 36 females, (age=27.1±8.8 years, wt=75.2±17.9 kg, ht= 172.8±9.7 cm) to participate in the study. Many of the participants participated on a University dance team. Participants admitted into the study were required to 

have upper trapezius pain, during palpation, of at least [ADDRESS_618223] 6 days, were undergoing current treatment for their upper trapezius, or were unable to lie on their stomach for an extended amount of time were removed from the study.    The study was approved by [CONTACT_77842]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB#[ZIP_CODE]) before participant recruitment. All participants provided written informed consent before individual data collection began.   Instruments   We used a GE LOGIC S8 ultrasound machine (4MDMedical, Lakewood, NJ) with the 9L soundhead to measure muscle thickness and stiffness. Muscle thickness was measured using B-mode ultrasound and SWE measured stiffness of the tissue.   In order to quantify subjective perception of pain we used PPT algometer (Jtech Medical Commander Echo pressure algometer, Jtech Medical, Midvale, UT) with a .[ADDRESS_618224] visit participants underwent screening for presence of inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as palpation for trigger points, following guidelines by [CONTACT_481285], Travell and Speicher (Simons &  Travell, 1981; Speicher, 2016). Each side was examined and pain produced during palpation was measured with previously published methods using the VAS (Crichton, 2001). The side that was to be treated was determined by [CONTACT_481286]. Trigger point location, found through palpation, was marked so that all measurements were taken in the same location. All baseline measurements were taken 
according to the methods listed below. The participants were then randomly assigned into one of two treatment groups, one being positional release therapy, the other therapeutic massage.  The same order of measurement was used for all participants since we felt that pressure from the PPT algometer could act as a treatment and influence the visual analog scale or elastography measures. Measurements were taken at rest with the participant in prone position, with their arms at their sides for all measurement series, before and after treatment.   Pain Pressure Threshold   Pain pressure threshold was determined by a digital pressure algometer on the same point identified during screening. The area was measured once by [CONTACT_481287]. The peak force measured was then recorded in kg.  Ultrasound and Elastography  The ultrasound machine with a 9L sound head was used to measure two different variables of muscle tension; 1) muscle thickness (B-mode) and tissue stiffness via SWE over the same spot found and marked during screening. Using B-mode on the ultrasound machine, two images aligned with the muscle fibers obtain were taken to obtain muscle thickness. Internal software was used to measure muscle thickness and the 2 images were averaged and recorded in cm. The elastography measure used a 3 cm2 box positioned over the area containing the trigger point. Nine sample circles of .5cm dimeter were set within the box side by [CONTACT_481288] (shown in figure 1). (source?) Each circle registered a strain modulus reading in kPa.  The average of the 9 sample circles was used to represent the stiffness of the muscle in the data 
analysis. 
 Treatment groups  Therapeutic Massage  Participants in the TM treatment group received a timed massage for 5 minutes by [CONTACT_481289].  A combination of effleurage and petrissage techniques were used in an organized pattern. Treatment started with effleurage (1-1.5 minutes) and proceeded to petrissage (2.5 to 3 minutes) again followed by [CONTACT_481290] (1 minute) over the marked area of the trigger point, but also in some surrounding areas. The pressure applied by [CONTACT_481291]. After the treatment was completed, the same dependent variable measurements were taken.    Positional Release Therapy  Participants in the PRT group received three successive treatments or releases in the marked area. The researcher located the marked trigger point and while maintaining contact, a light pressure with the clinician’s fingertip was applied creating slight dimpling of the skin and blanching of the clinician’s fingernail bed. Following palpation, the researcher moved the participant’s shoulder into passive abduction and scapular upward rotation and retraction until a position of comfort was achieved with no pain reported by [CONTACT_2299], as directed by [CONTACT_481292], “Clinical Guide to Positional Release Therapy” (Speicher, 2016) (Figure 3). The participant was instructed to remain completely relaxed during the [ADDRESS_618225] one, as recommended by [CONTACT_481292] (Speicher, 2016). Following treatment, the same dependent variable measurements were taken.   Posttreatment measurements   Each participant returned [ADDRESS_618226] session, over the examined trigger point, was still visible at the second visit for all participants and was used to determine the location for performing dependent measurements.  
Statistical Analysis  A mixed-models analysis of variance was performed for each of the dependent variables (VAS, US, elastography, and PPT). The covariates considered in the analysis were the participants’ sex, side of treatment, height, weight, and age. A step-wise regression was used to determine significant covariates for each of the dependent variables. Following the step-wise regression the primary variables of interest, treatment and time of measurement were added along with their interaction for each of the dependent variables. Post hoc t-tests were used to evaluate differences in the measurements. All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (Chapel Hill, North Carolina) and alpha was set at p<0.05.

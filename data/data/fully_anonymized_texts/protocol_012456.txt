Study Termination  The study will end when its enrollment, regulatory and study drug exposure 
objectives have been met.  Consequently, not all enrolled patients will receive 53 
weeks of treatment.  
Study Drug  Plecanatide 6 mg tablets  
Rescue Medication  Bisacodyl (Dulcolax®) 5 mg tablets  
Treatment Duration  Up to 53 weeks (1 year)  
Study Design  This is a phase 3, multicenter, open -label, long -term safety  and tolerability  study 
of [ADDRESS_188051] dose of study drug in SP304203 -04 or SP304203- 05 or , for 
eligible screen failures, on the day of or within 4 weeks of the end of their

Final Version 3.0  5 of 54  July 21, 201 6   participation in  SP304203 -04 or SP304203 -05 study  (Short Interval Patients) .  
If the patient is plecanatide study -naive, participated in the SP304- [ZIP_CODE], or more 
than 4 weeks  has elapsed since the patient’s last dose of study drug in the 
SP304203- 04 or SP304203- 05 study , or more than 4 weeks has elapsed since 
the end of an eligible screen failure’s participation in SP304203- 04 or SP304203-
05, the patient will need to undergo additional screening assessments in order to 
be considered for enrol lment into this trial  (Long Int erval Patients) . 
Beginning on Day 1, patients will take an oral dose of study drug QD for up to 53 
weeks.  Dose adjustments of study drug are not permitted in thi s study.  Patients 
who interrupt study treatment for adverse events, intercurrent illness or other  
issues may continue in the study with the approval of the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_162025] . 
 
Bisacodyl (Dulcolax®)  5 mg tablets will be supplied as rescue medication (RM) for 
the study.  
 
Safety and tolerability assessments  and patients’ self -assessment of disease 
severity  will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments.  
 
Patients who discontinue early from the study will undergo an Early Withdrawal 
(EW) visit within 5 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743].  Patients who prematurely withdraw from study treatment will not be eligible to participate in this or any other plecanatide study in the future.   Upon study termination by [CONTACT_1034], patients 
will undergo an End of Treatment (EOT) visit.  
 
Criteria for Evaluation  
Safety  and 
Tolerability   Evaluation of the safety of once daily (QD) plecanatide over up to 53 weeks of 
dosing will be based on the occurrence of treatment -emergent adverse events  
(TEAEs ) and assessment of: vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, physical 
examinations and electrocardiograms .  Tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_162045], AE -free days, and continued 
participation in the trial. 
 
Statistical Methods  A formal Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) will be written and include details of all 
statistical methods to be used to analyze the long- term safety and tolerability of 
plecanatide.

In addition to assessment of safety and tolerability of the once- daily 6 mg oral dose of plecanatide, 
patient s’ self-assessment of disease severity and adequacy of treatment will be performed. The desire for 
treatment continuation will be assess ed for each patient at their last visit in the study.  
This clinical trial will b e conducted in approximately [ADDRESS_188058] dose in the core studies  (Short Interval Patients) . 
For plecanatide study -naive patients, SP30 4-[ZIP_CODE] patients, and any patient that needs a colonoscopy 
(as outlined in Appendix 3), or when more than [ADDRESS_188059] study drug dose in 
the core studies, the patient will need to undergo additional screening assessments in order to be 
considered for enroll ment into this trial  (Long Interval Patients) .

For Study Completers ---after completing the requirements of the end- of-study visit (Visit 6) in the core 
studies , qualifying patients will be given the option to enter the SP304203- 06 Study, ideally enrolling into 
SP304203- 06 on the same day, where they will receive treatment with 6 mg plecanatide in an open- label 
fashion for up to 53 weeks . 
For Eligible Screen F ailure patients  and patients that withdrew early due to lack of efficacy from 
SP304203- 04 or SP304203- 05 (the core studies) - sites will be notified  of eligible patients who meet 
eligibility criteria through IWRS or Medical Monitor or designee for possible enrollment into the study .  
Sites should also request notice of eligibility.  
Short Interval Patients: Patients enrolling from the core studies (a) less than or equal to [ADDRESS_188060] dose of study drug  or (b) less than or equal to 4 weeks from Visit 2 for patients that are Eligible 
Screen Failure patients : The patient’s participation in this trial will start at the  Baseline/Day 1 Visit, as per 
the schedule of  assessments in Table 3.   After written informed consent is obtained, patients will receive Core Studie s:

single oral dose of study drug once daily for up to 53 weeks.   
Long Interval Patients: All patients enrolling that are (a) plecanatide study -naive, (b)  SP304 -[ZIP_CODE] 
(Phase 2) patients , (c) greater than [ADDRESS_188062] dose of study drug in the core study or (d) 
greater than 4 weeks  from Visit 2 for patients that are Eligible Screen Failure patients in the core study : 
These patients will additionally require t he Screening Visit, as per the schedule of assessments in     
Table 4.   Written informed consent will  be obtained at the screening visit.  Consented patients will then 
undergo screening procedures to determine eligibility for further participation.  Patients eligible to continue 
on to Day [ADDRESS_188063] dose at the clinical site.  
Patients will continue to take a single oral dose of study drug once daily for up to 53 weeks.   
If there is doubt about whether a patient is a Short Interval Patient or a Long Interval Patient, they should be considered a Long Interval Patient and a Screening Visit performed.  The performance of a Screening 
Visit, even if not strictly required, will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
Safety and tolerability assessments and patients’ self -assessment of disease severity and adequacy of  
treatment will be performed  at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 53, as specified in the schedule of assessments 
(Table 3 or Table 4, as applicable).  The desire for treatment continuation will be assessed for each 
patient at their last visit in the study.  
Dose adjustments are not permitted during this  study.  Bisacodyl (Dulcolax®) 5 mg tablets will be 
supplied as rescue medication (RM).  
 
Patients who interrupt study treatment for adverse events,  intercurrent illness or study drug supply issues 
may continue in the study with the approval of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_162026] . 
 
2 INTRODUCTION 
 
2.1 Background 
 
2.1.1  Overview of Irritable Bowel Syndrome  
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is characterized by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_162027].  The altered bowel habits may include diarrhea, constipation or a mixed pattern of diarrhea and constipation.  Abdominal discomfort or pain is a universal feature required for the diagnosis of IBS , and the presence of the predominant abnormal bowel pattern leads to 
the subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_162028]: diarrhea- predominant (D -IBS), constipation- predominant (C -IBS), or mixed IBS (M -
IBS).  Of the approximately [ADDRESS_188064] experience constipation during epi[INVESTIGATOR_162029] [ 1].  The 
remaining patients are equally subdivided among the other two subtypes [ 2].  IBS is a chronic condition, 
and may start in adolescence with a 2- 3:[ADDRESS_188065] 3 days/month in the last 3 months associated with 2 or more of  the 
following:  1) improvement with defecation, 2) onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, and 3) 
onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.  The IBS -C subtype is further characterized 
by [CONTACT_162046] ≥ 25% of defecations are hard or lumpy stools and < 25% of defecations are 
loose or watery stools [ 3].  This study focuses on patients with IBS -C.   
Several underlying mechanisms have been implicated in the pathophysiology of IBS, although much 
remains poorly understood [ 3, 4].  The pain that patients with IBS experience is believed to be due to

Protocol SP304203 -06  CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
Final Version 3.0  15 of 54  July 21, 201 6   visceral hypersensitivity.  In these patients visceral stimuli which are usually normal or not bothersome (in 
non-IBS patients) are perceived as painful.  Psychosocial stressors, genetic factors, altered intestinal 
microbiota, and altered brain- gut interaction have been theorized to exacerbate or lead to symptoms of 
IBS.  Infection and post -infectious inflammation have also been postulated to lead to the development of 
IBS or symptoms of IBS [ 5].  According to the Rome III criteria, a patient has to have continuous or 
intermittent symptoms of abdominal discomfort for at least 6 months before the diagnosis of IBS can be considered [ 6].
 
IBS-C is a multi- symptom disease and the goal of therapy is to provide treatment that alleviates its 
multiple symptoms.  Currently, in clinical practice, treatments are typi[INVESTIGATOR_162030]- C.  If a patient has predominantly constipation symptoms, the patient is 
usually prescribed a fiber supplement or a laxative.  If bloating and distension occur, the patient may be 
prescribed an antispasmodic or dietary modification.  If a patient complains of abdominal pain, the patient may receive t ricyclic anti- depressants although there is no FDA approved treatment for pain associated 
with IBS -C.  
2.1.2  Plecanatide Mechanism of Action  
Plecanatide, a synthetic hexadecapeptide designed to mimic the actions of uroguanylin, is currently being 
developed by [CONTACT_95843]. (Synergy) for treatment of IBS-C and CIC . 
Uroguanylin (UG) and guanylin (GN) are endogenous peptide agonists of receptor guanylate cyclase- C 
(GC-C) that is expressed on the luminal surface of epi[INVESTIGATOR_162031] (GI) tract 
mucosa.   These receptor agonists, including plecanatide, bind and activate GC -C receptor to stimulate 
the intracellular production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in decreased Na
+ 
reabsorption through Na+/H+ exchange and activation of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane 
Conductance Regulator (CFTR).  Activation of CFTR and the subsequent enhancement of transepi[INVESTIGATOR_162032] [ 7]. This fluid 
secretion is expected to facilitate bowel movements.  
In addition to being a secretagogue, plecanatide has demonstrated anti -inflammatory activity in the 
mouse DSS colitis model [ 8, 9]. This anti -inflammatory activity may be beneficial for treatment of IBS -C.    
2.1.3  Clinical Experience  
In a recently completed double- blind trial, plecanatide has been shown to increase significantly the 
frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) and to improve symptoms in patients with IBS -C; it was safe and well -tolerated.  Plecanatide has also been shown to increase the frequency of 
bowel movements (BMs) in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) in a double- blind trial.  
Effects on stool consistency and reduction of the time to first bowel movement were also seen.   
Four clinical studies have been completed with plecanatide to date. They are summarized in Table 1.

The Phase I study (SP304 101-08) was a single dose escalation study in 71 healthy subjects receiving 
doses of 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, 2.7, 5.4, 8.1, 16.2, 24.3, or 48.6 mg plecanatide (n=53) or placebo (n=18).  The 
study reported no systemic absorption at any dose and no serious adverse events (SAEs) or withdrawals 
due to adverse events (AEs).  Diarrhea was the most common AE in the study reported by 8 of 53 (15.1%) plecanatide subjects and 3 of 18 (16.7%) placebo subjects.  The occurrence of diarrhea did not appear to be dose- related.  Other AEs occurring in 2 or more subjects included: abdominal discomfort, 
nausea, and vomiting [ 10]. 
The Phase 2a study in patients with CIC ( SP30420 1-09) was a 14- day, repeat -dose, placebo- controlled, 
oral dose- escalation study to determine the safety of plecanatide.  Seventy -eight patients were enrolled in 
this study and randomized to receive one of four plecanatide doses: 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, 3.0 mg, and 9.0 mg 
or placebo.  Each dose cohort consisted of 20 patients (15 active; 5 placebo).  After each cohort was 
completed, a safety review was conducted prior to initiating the next dose cohort.  There were no SAEs  or 
withdrawals due to AEs for any of the patients who received plecanatide during this study.  Adverse events occurring in 2 or more subjects included: headache, flatulence, and elevated lipase.  None of the [ADDRESS_188066] udy had diarrhea.  The majority of AEs were mild or 
moderate in severity and transient in nature [ 11]. 
The Phase 2b st udy in patients with CIC ( SP30 4-[ZIP_CODE]) was a large, 12- week, multicenter, dose- ranging 
study [ 12].  This randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study was initiated in October 2011 (first 
dose) and completed in December 2012 (last patient, last visit).  A total of 951 patients were randomized at 113 clinical site in the US.  Randomization was 1:1:1:1 to plecanatide (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg) or placebo.  In this study, 948 patients received study drug (712 plecanatide) and [ADDRESS_188067] one study assessment and were included in the modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population.  In the high (3.0 mg) 
dose group (n=237), the proportion of patients who were Overall Responders  (19%) was statistically 
significantly greater than in patients treated with placebo (10.7%) (p=0.009).   
Among secondary endpoints there were statistically significant changes from baseline (as compared to placebo) that were dose- related in the frequency of CSBMs, stool consistency (higher Bristol Stool Form 
Scale (BSFS) score), and straining with the greatest change and degree of statistical significance at the 
3.[ADDRESS_188068] SBM were statistically significantly shorter for all doses of 
plecanatide compared to placebo (27.3 hours) with the shortest median time to first SBM of 12.5 hours at the 3.0 mg dose. Statistically significantly different (from placebo) changes in patient global assessments and the PAC -SYM and PAC -QOL sca les were also seen over the [ADDRESS_188069] common adverse event, which increased with increasing dose to an incidence of 
9.7% in the 3.0 mg dose group. Of the cases of diarrhea in patients treated with plecanatide, 0.7% overall 
were considered severe and in patients receiving 3.0 mg, only one case (0.4%) was considered severe. The other most common TEAEs occurring in at least 2% of patients were headache, abdominal pain, nausea, abdominal distension, urinary tract infection, flatulence, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].  SAEs were uncommon, occurring in only nine study patients, and none were considered related to study drug.  
Overall, approximately 5.5% of patients on 3.0 mg of plecanatide withdrew due to adverse events 
compared to 3.4% on placebo.  Three percent of patients at the 3.0 mg dose withdrew participation due to diarrhea compared to 0.4% on placebo.  There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory tests, ECGs, or vital signs. Further details can be found in the Investigator's Brochure that contains additional information on plecanatide.  
The most recently completed study was a 12- week, multicenter, dose- ranging study ( SP304- [ZIP_CODE]) in 
patients with IBS -C [Data on file, Synergy Pharmaceuticals].  This randomized, double- blind, placebo-
controlled study was initiated in January 2013 (first dose) and completed in March 2014 (last patient, last 
visit) at 94 sites in the [LOCATION_002].   In this study, 428 patients received study drug (342 plecanatide) 
and [ADDRESS_188070] one study assessment and were included in the modified Intent -to-Treat 
(mITT) population. The mITT population was the primary analysis population for all efficacy parameters.  Randomization was 1:1:1:1:1 to plecanatide (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 or 9.0 mg daily) or placebo.  
The plecanatide 3.0 mg dose was selected as one of the doses for phase 3 based on achieving statistically significant improvement in the study’s primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints assessed in the topline analyses, which included change from baseline versus placebo over 12 weeks in: CSBM frequency (1.29 placebo vs. 2.74, p=<0.001), worst abdominal pain intensity ( -1.4 [ -24.5%] 
placebo vs.-2.0 [ -33.9%], p=<0.05) and stool consistency (BSFS) (1.01 placebo vs. 2.49, p=<0.001). 
Importantly, plecanatide 3.0 mg dose also showed a statistically significant difference from placebo in the overall FDA responder endpoint (21% placebo vs. 41.9%, p=<0.05). An Overall Responder for the FDA endpoint fulfills both ≥30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥1 complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) from baseline in the same week for at least 50% of the weeks 
(i.e. 6/12 weeks).The tr eatment effects of plecanatide occurred within the first week. Plecanatide was safe 
and well tolerated with no treatment -related serious adverse events. The most common event was 
diarrhea, which occurred in 9.3 percent of the 3.0 mg plecanatide- treated pat ients.  
Three large Phase 3 clinical trials with plecanatide in patients with Chronic Idiopathic  Constipation (CIC) 
have been completed: (SP304203- 00, SP304203- 01, SP304203- 03), and two Phase 3 studies  in Irritable 
Bowel Syndrome with Constipation ( IBS-C) a re ongoing: (SP304203- 04, SP304203- 05). 
2.[ADDRESS_188071] that it is well -tolerated and may improve bowel frequency while decreasing abdominal 
pain.  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long- term safety and tolerability of plecanatide 
administered once daily for the treatment of IBS -C.  In addition, patients’ assessments of disease severity 
and adequacy of treatment will be collected.  Desire for treatment continuation will be assessed for each 
patient at their last visit in the study.

Final Version 3.0  18 of 54  July 21, 201 6   2.2.1  Rationale for the Dose Selection  
The once a day 6 mg dose of plecanatide selected for this study is based upon observations from  prior 
plecanatide studies. Doses of  3 and 9 mg/day given for [ADDRESS_188072] intended dose in this indication.  
2.3 Risk- Benefit Assessment  
Based on previously completed clinical studies in patients with IBS -C and CIC, the anticipated benefits of 
treatment with 6 mg/day of plecanatide for 53 weeks are expected to outweigh the potential risks.  
Plecanatide has demonstrated no detectable systemic absorption (with a 1 to 10 ng/ml limit of detection).  
Moreover, the safety profile for 9 mg plecanatide administered daily for 12 weeks was quite acceptable; a 
dose of [ADDRESS_188073] as safe and well tolerated.  Study patients will be carefully monitored for TEAEs at scheduled study visits.  
2.4 Criteria for Evaluation of the Study  
The safety , tolerability and exploratory endpoints are described below.  For information concerning the 
analyses of these endpoints, see Section 8.   
2.4.1  Safety and Tolerability Endpoints  
Safety and tolerability will be measured by [CONTACT_162047] -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) , treatment 
interruptions due to diarrhea or other AEs, AE -free days, and the percentage of patients remaining in the 
study at each week .  Other clinically  significant changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, 
physical examinations and ECGs  will be assessed.    
2.4.2  Exploratory Endpoints  
Patients’ assessments of disease severity and adequacy of treatment will be collected by [CONTACT_6270]-
administered questionnaire s completed by [CONTACT_162048], ideally  prior to any other study 
assessments  (see Appendix 1 for details) . 
2.5 Study Design  
An open- label, single -arm design with up to 53 weeks of treatment with plecanatide 6  mg QD (the highest 
dose being evaluated in the core studies) was chosen in accordance with the ICH E1 exposure guideline 
for drugs intended for chronic use.  This study will provide additional data related to the chronic use of 
plecanatide at the dose intended f or clinical use in patients with IBS-C. (See Figure 1)

Final Version 3.0  19 of 54  July 21, 201 6   3 STUDY POPULATION  
The study population consists of male and female adult patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome with 
Constipation (IBS -C).  Patients must meet all of the study entry criteria listed below to be enrolled . 
Every effort should be made to ensure that the patient’s participation in this trial begins as soon as 
participation in the plecanatide (“ core”) study  SP304203- [ADDRESS_188075] 
visit of this trial ( SP304 203-06) will occur on the same day as the core study’s  end-of-study visit ( Visit 6 ) 
for patients completing the study. For qualifying screen -failure patients , the first visit of this trial will also 
ideally occur on the same day as the core study’s Visit 2.  For qualifying patients that withdrew early due 
to lack of efficacy, the first visit of this trial will also ideally occur on the same day as the core study’s EW 
Visit.  In addition, plecanatide study -naive  patients and patients that participated in the Phase [ADDRESS_188076] meet ONE of the following:  
1. Completed plecanatide study SP304203- 04 or SP30420 3-05, were compliant with the previous 
study’s requirements, and did not experience any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) deemed related to 
study drug during the course of the previous study.  
2. Failed screening in study SP304203- 04 or SP304203- 05 due to diary noncompliance (exclusion 
criterion 24 of the core study)  or due to another reason , and in all cases,  is allowed to enter this study 
by [CONTACT_162049]; confirmation of active IBS -C via ROME III modular 
questionnaire is required.  
3. Withdrew early from SP304203- 04 or SP304203- 05 due to lack of efficacy and completed an early 
withdrawal visit (Visit EW) in the core study.  
4. Completed plecanatide study SP304- [ZIP_CODE]  
5. Completed an early withdrawal visit in SP304- [ZIP_CODE] study and reason for withdrawal was not a drug 
related AE  
6. Never participated in a plecanatide study (plecanatide study -naive  patient) 18 to 85 years of age 
(inclusive) with IBS-C as defined by [CONTACT_6945] (See ROME III modular questionnaire for IBS in 
Appendix 2).  
 
Note:  Details of how to use the Rome III questionnaire and the scoring system is provided in Appendix 2. 
At the clinical site patients will be given simple instructions on how to complete the form only; authorized personnel will review them for completeness only, to ensure that all questions have been answered. At no 
time will study staff correct or suggest changes of patient entries. The patient -reported responses to the 
questionnaire will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1719], who will use the scoring table provided in 
Appendix 2 for documentation of patients’ eligibility.  The questionnaire and the scoring chart will be kept 
as part of the patient’s source documents.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
For patients entering from one of the core studies presence of any of the  following will exclude the patient 
from enrollment:  
1. Patient is unwilling or unable to: participate in the study for the required duration, understand and 
sign the informed consent form (ICF) and undergo all protocol related tests and procedures 
throughout  the study.

11. Patient has any pre- existing medical condition (based on medical history or PE or laboratory 
evaluations ) that is considered clinically significant enough to potentially interfere with study 
assessments or the patient’s  participation in and completion of the study. The Investigator must get 
approval from the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee before randomizing any patient who has what the Investigator considers clinically -significant medical history, signs, symptoms, or test results 
during the Screening Period of the study.  These include but are not limited to:  
a. History of or current clinically significant cardiovascular, nervous system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine or gastrointestinal disease.   Gastrointestinal diseases and conditions include 
inflammatory disorders ( e.g., ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s Diseases), familial adenomatous 
polyposis , structural abnormality of the GI tract that can affect GI motility or defecation, surgery to 
remove or by[CONTACT_162051]

recorded in the eCRF.  
3.3.1  Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
All prescription, non- prescription, or herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_162034] , except the Sponsor -supplied rescue medication (see Section 
3.3.2) .   
The following concomitant medications and supplements  are prohibited during the study :  
• Resolor

Final Version 3.0  22 of 54  July 21, 201 6   • Lactulose  
• Laxatives, except the Sponsor -supplied rescue medication (RM)  
Note: There is no indication of any specific safety risk when these generally prohibited agents are used 
concomitantly with plecanatide; however, appropriate medical caution should be exercised when agents 
that may aggravate underlying constipation are taken or when agents with similar physiological outcomes (i.e., increased BM frequency) are used together.   
3.3.2  Permitted Concomitant Medications  
Bisacodyl (Dulcolax ®) 5 mg tablets will be supplied as rescue medication (RM) for the study.  Patients 
must only use the Dulcolax ® supplied by [CONTACT_162053].  See Sections 4.4.7 and 6.2 
for more information on RM.  Drugs given to treat AEs will be allowed.  
4 VARIABLES AND METHODS OF ASSESSMENT  
 
4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
 
Demographic data, medical history  (including ongoing AEs ) and previous/ concomitant medications 
recorded in the eCRF of the previous plecanatide core study will be replicated in the eCRF for this open-
label study when the patient signs the informed consent and is enrolled into this open- label study .  New 
informat ion or clinically -significant changes since the core trial will be solicited from all patients for 
appropriate updates to the eCRF for this open- label study.  
 4.1.1  Disease and Medical History 
 
A complete medical history and GI disease history will be recorded for all plecanatide study -naive  and 
SP304-2 0212 patients. Source documentation for previous treatment, diagnosis, and interventions, where 
available, should be included in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source documentation 
verification.  The outcome of the medical history assessment may be recorded as part of the worksheet for evaluation of eligibility and can be added to the patient’s medical records.  
 
4.2 Colonoscopy  
A colonoscopy is not required to make a diagnosis of IBS or IBS -C.  However, there are two clinical 
settings where a colonoscopy is required during the screening period: 
 
 
1) If a patient has not completed a recommended colonoscopy based on the colon cancer s creening 
and surveillance colonoscopy intervals outlined by [CONTACT_162054], then a study -related eligibility 
colonoscopy can be authorized (see note) but must be completed within first 21 days following  
screening ( Visit 0).   See Appendix 3 for a brief summary of the AGA guidelines for colonoscopy 
screening and surveillance for prevention of colorectal cancer.  
OR, 
2) If the patient satisfies all other Inclusion/Exclusion criteria at Screening Visit and has an 
unexplained and clinically significant “alarm” sign(s) or symptom(s) at Visit 1 and the Investigator determines that a colonoscopy is required to adequately assess the “alarm” sign or symptom, 
then a study related eligibility colonoscopy can be requested (see note) but must be completed 
within 21 days following  screening ( Visit 0).    
 
Note: If a colonoscopy is to be conducted as part of this study under either of the clinical scenarios outlined 
above, it will require sponsor or Medical Monitor approval, via the colonoscopy approval form.  O nce 
sponsor/medical monitor approval has been received, the procedure must be completed within 21 days following screening ( Visit 0) and results must be reviewed and all findings must be negative for the presence 
of cancer or any of the GI conditions detai led in the exclusion criteria before the patient can be enrolled into 
the study.

Final Version 3.0  23 of 54  July 21, 201 6   4.3 Patient Reported Outcomes  
The following patient questionnaires will be administered at the scheduled study visits:   
• Patient Rating of Relief of IBS Symptoms  
• Treatment Satisfaction Assessment  
• Treatment Continuation Assessment  
The self-administered questionnaires will be conducted during the scheduled study visits  (as specified in  
Section 5.2), preferably prior to any other study assessments.  Completion of the questionna ires takes 1 
to 5 minutes .  The items of the questionnaires are depi[INVESTIGATOR_162036] 1.  
4.4 Safety Variables  
4.4.1  Collection of Adverse Events  
Adverse event (AE) collection for the study will begin immediately after the ICF is signed. All AEs 
occurring prior to first dose of study drug are considered medical history (MH).  It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator to ensure that all serious and non -serious AEs are collected.  For details on the 
assessment, reporting, recording and follow -up of adverse events, see Section  7. IBS-C is characterized 
primarily by [CONTACT_162055]; however, several additional symptoms are often associated 
with IBS -C including abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, incomplete evacuation and straining with 
bowel movements.  Because IBS -C is the condition under study in this clinical trial these IBS -C related 
symptoms are expected over the course of a patients participation in the trial; therefore, when reported as related to IBS -C, these symptoms should not be recorded as adverse events.      
4.4.[ADDRESS_188079] of Study 
Personnel  and Vendors .  The Laboratory Manual provided to investigative sites include s detailed 
instructions regarding the collection, processing, and handling of laboratory samples, including those for immunogenicity testing.  
6 to 12- hour fasting is recommended before laboratory assessments  are performed.  The laboratory 
variables presented in  Table 2 will be assessed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 
3 or Table 4, as applicable ). 
Approximately 2.0 mL of blood will be drawn for each hematology sample, 5.0 mL for each serum chemistry sample, and 3.5 mL for each immunogenicity sample. The total blood volume collected  from 
each patient  for laboratory tests, not including possible repeat tests, over the course of 53 weeks will be 
approximately 60 mL.

Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304203 -[ADDRESS_188090] be completed and 
documented.   When a patient is found to be eligible to enter the study, the investigator or designee will 
document enrollment of the patient in the site enrollment log.  The Patient ID number will be the same as 
the 6-digit Patient ID used in the previous plecanatide study, except in rare circumstances when an 
administrative change to the Patient ID, pre- approved by [CONTACT_1034], is required . The Patient ID number 
is also reflected as same in the eCRF.  
Plecanatide study -naive  and SP304-2 0212 patient numbering: A unique 6- digit patient number will be 
assigned consecutively for each patient using the site enrollment log selection after he or she signs the 
ICF.  Unique patient numbers will begin with the clinical site number, e.g., 001 followed by a 3- digit 
number such as 601. The unique patient numbers will be assigned sequentially by [CONTACT_19826].  
For example, for clinical site number 002, the unique patient numbers might be as follows: 002- 601, 002-
602, 002- 603, etc.  The patient will keep this unique patient number for the duration of the study.  
Depending on the length of time elapsed since  participation in the core study  (SP304203- 04 or 
SP304203- 05) and whether patient is plecanatide study -naive  or from SP304-[ADDRESS_188091] initial enrollment requirements:  
1) Patients who either completed the core study, withdrew early,  or screen failed ≤4 weeks  earlier

5.2.5  Early Withdrawal  (EW) – visit performed ideally within [ADDRESS_188097] study drug intake 
Patients are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time.  Investigators may choose to discontinue a patient’s participation in the study if they believe it is in the patient’s best interest clinically. 
Patients unwilling or unable to maintain compliance with study drug administration or protocol procedures may be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator.  
The following qualify as adverse events (AEs) due to which study participation may be terminated:  
- Changes in laboratory values, PE findings or other assessments considered by [CONTACT_16426]  
- Clinically significant TEAEs including clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities or SAEs regardless of relatedness to study treatment that cause the patient, Investigator or Sponsor to 
feel it is not in the patient’s best interest to continue.  
A patient may also be withdrawn from study drug/study by [CONTACT_1034], Regulatory Authorities, or the IRB/IEC . Since the study will end when its enrollment, regulatory and study drug exposure objectives 
have been met, patients may complete at the time of study termination even if they have not received 53 
weeks of therapy .  Patients will also be withdrawn if the entire study is terminated prematurely as 
described in Section 9.10.

patient will be assigned to 6 mg plecanatide open- label treatment for the duration of their participation in 
the trial.  
Study drug will be administered for up to 53 consecutive weeks.  Except on Day 1, when patients will take 
the study drug at the clin ical site, patients will be instructed to take the study drug once daily at home - 
one (1) tablet every morning (preferably at the same time each day) with approximately 240 mL (8 
ounces) of liquid, with or without meals.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_188101] been administered without medically important consequence.  
6.4 Packaging, Labeling and Storage  
6.4.1  Packaging  
The investigational drug kits will be supplied to the clinical sites by [CONTACT_95861] (Allentown, 
PA) for Synergy .  Sites will manually order additional kits with the Manual Shipment Request form  
The Investigator or qualified designee will disp ense/administer  the study drug only to patients eligible for 
participation and enrolled in this study , following the procedures described in this protocol.   
Each investigational drug kit will contain a 4- week supply (28 tablets) in blister packaging with four extra 
tablets (total of 32 tablets) to allow for window extension for a study visit.  Individually blister packaged 
tablets will be provided in four connected 1- week strips as a 4- panel key -pack that folds into a carton. The 
two bottom panels fold up into the two top panels, nesting blister cavities. Instructions for releasing a tablet from the blister dome are printed on the outside of the carton.   At each dispensing visit, each 
patient will be given a numbered drug kit(s). The patient’s unique number will be written in the designated area of the kit label; the tear -off portion of the label will be kept in the clinical site’s source records.  
Study drug will be dispensed to the patient as follows:  
• Visit 1  (Day 1 , Week 1 ): one (1) study drug kit for dosing from Day 1 to end of Week 4, inclusive.  
• Visit 2  (End of Week 4): two (2) study drug kits for daily dosing from Week 5 to end of Week 12,

Four (4) drug kits will be dispensed at Visit 5 (End of Week 36). This supply will include 128 tablets (28 
days plus 4 extra tablets per carton).  
At Visit 6 (End of Week 53) or Early Withdrawal , document the patient’s End of Treatment or Early 
Withdrawal visit date.   The patient’s reported last dose of study drug will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.4.[ADDRESS_188102] a unique yellow label  containing the following information:  
protocol number, drug kit number, contents, directions for use, storage conditions,  identification of 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. as the Sponsor  and the statements: “Caution: New Drug - Limited by 
[CONTACT_162060].  Investigational Drug – To be used by [CONTACT_95865].  For 
Clinical Trial Use Only.  Keep Ou t of Reach of Children.”   
The label will include the following fields to be completed by [CONTACT_8786]: Investigator name [CONTACT_162080], subject identification number and treatment weeks.  There will be a smaller label on the carton spi[INVESTIGATOR_162037].  When dispensing a kit to a patient, complete the 
required information and retain the tear -off portion of the label in the source documents. At each 
monitoring visit, the source document records will be verified against the drug accountability logs . 
6.4.3  Storage  
The Investigator, or qualified designee, is responsible for the proper storage of the study medications according to the Sponsor’s recommendations and all applicable Federal/State regulatory guidelines.  At 
the clinical  site, plecanatide must be stored at controlled room temperature 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F) in a 
secure area with restricted access and with Min- Max temperature monitoring. Deviations from Sponsor ’s 
recommendations/ guidelines should be reported, as directed in the Temperature Excursion Reporting 
Form.   
Patients will be instructed to store their blister -packs at room temperature defined for this study as 20 to 
25°C (68 to 77°F).  
 
The Investigator must agree not to dispense or store investigational drug at any l ocation other than that 
listed on the Form FDA 1572.  
 6.5 Drug Accountability  
Distribution of all investigational drug kits and acknowledgement of receipt of drug shipments will be 
recorded in an IP shipment distribution tracker maintained by [CONTACT_162061].  
In addition, accurate records of study drug dispensed to patients will be kept by [CONTACT_737], or 
qualified designee, specifying the kit number on the drug kit, the patient number assigned, the amount 
dispensed to each patient  and the date dispensed, using the appropriate eCRF page for the patient.    
At each visit after Baseline (Day 1), the patient is asked to return their previously dispensed drug kit and 
the number of remaining tablets is entered into the eCRF for drug accountability.  
 
A drug accountability log must be available for inspection at each monitoring visit and at the completion of the study.  At the completion of the study, the Investigator will provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_162038].  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304203 -[ADDRESS_188103] party in accordance 
with the Sponsor’s (or designee’s) written instructions.   The Investigator must verify that all unused or 
partially used study drug supplies have been returned by [CONTACT_162062]’s possession.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_188104] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug- related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of an 
investigational product or study procedure whether or not considered related to the product or procedure.  
All AEs, including intercurrent illnesses  and regardless of the source of identification (e.g., PE, laboratory 
assessm ent, ECG, reported by [CONTACT_4676]) , occurring during the study will be documented in the eCRF.  
Concomitant illnesses, which existed before entry into the study, will not be considered AEs unless they 
worsen (increase in intensity or frequency ) during the treatment period.  
Adverse events occurring from the time of ICF signing up to the intake of the first dose of study drug will 
be classified as pre- existing conditions for this study.   Serious AEs (as defined below) occurring from the 
time of ICF signing up to the intake of the first dose of study medication will be collected and reported as 
such.  A TEAE is defined as an AE that begins or that worsens in frequency and/or severity after at least one dose of study drug has been administered.  
Minor fluctuations in laboratory values for standard monitoring (abnormal values) that the Investigator 
does not consider clinically significant or related to study drug will not be recorded as AEs.  However, if the laboratory abnormality is associated with a diagnosis, then the AE term for that diagnosis will be reported (see Section 7.4 for recording of AEs).  
7.[ADDRESS_188105] - Diarrhea  
An increase in the frequency of BMs and loosening of the stool consistency from baseline are expected pharmacodynamic effects of plecanatide.  These same attributes (increased stool frequency and looser stool consistency) are often used to define “diarrhea’; however, in light of significant inter -patient 
variability in bowel habit “phenotype” and wide differences in the perception of a “normal” bowel habit there is no standard definition of “diarrhea” for this patient population.  An increase in frequency o r 
consistency for one person is a welcome event , while for another patient it might be bothersome 
“diarrhea”.  
One mechanism to introduce a level of consistency across patients, sites and the trial is to code an event as diarrhea only if it is characterized by a specific patient -reported and clinically relevant attribute such as 
“bothersomeness”.  Therefore, for this trial, for any event associated with a significant increase from baseline in BM frequency and/or loosening of BM consistency -  that would otherwise be coded as 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304203 -[ADDRESS_188106] it as an AE only if the patient reports that it was bothersome (as 
defined by [CONTACT_6904]).   
7.[ADDRESS_188107] medical occurrence that , at any dose, is one of the following:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening; (an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life 
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the 
patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions ; 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect ; 
• Is a medically important event (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48802])  
The FDA has defined additional “Medically Important Events”  that should also be reported as SAEs  
[13].
 These include cases where:  
• Aminotransferases (ALT or AST) are ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with an 
associated elevation of Total Bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_188108] without evidence of hemolysis or with 
alkaline phosphatase < [ADDRESS_188109] or not available OR  
• ALT or AST activity that is greater than [ADDRESS_188110] bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, and related laboratory assessments of albumin, PT and PTT, creatinine kinase, and GGTP or 5’nucleotidase.   Hepatitis A, B, and C, hemolysis, and biliary obstruction should be ruled out. A detailed medical and drug use history should be taken to exclude all potential causes.  
The Medical Monitor should be consulted prior to withdrawing a patient early due to elevated ALT or AST .   
7.3.2  Intensity (Severity)  
The Investigator will assess the intensit y/severity of AEs according to the following general categorical 
descriptors:  
Mild:    Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated

Severe:    Medically significant but not immediately life- threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living e.g., bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas 
seriousness is a regulatory definition as per Section 7.3.1.  An AE of severe intensity may not necessarily 
be considered serious (by [CONTACT_108]) or a mild AE ( e.g., mild stroke) may be considered as an SAE.  
7.3.3  Causality  
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug , or study procedure, and 
the AE and record that assessment in the eCRF.  
The causal relationship of the AE to study drug will be described in terms of:  
Reasonable Possibility:   There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE (e.g., AE is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
drug exposure or is uncommon in the study population, but not commonly associated with drug exposure)  
No Reasonable Possibility:  There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and 
the AE.  
The study conduct relatedness for AEs and SAEs will also be assessed and documented.  The most 
likely cause of an AE or SAE (e.g., disease under treatment, concomitant disease, concomitant 
medication, other) will be recorded in the eCRF with details of the concomitant disease or medication or 
other cause.  
7.[ADDRESS_188111] within 24 hours.   
All SAEs and deaths (as SAE or as outcome of SAE) must be reported whether or not considered 
causally related to the study medication.  Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of the study 
(i.e., beyond [ADDRESS_188112] study drug dose), which the Investigator considers to be related to study 
medication, must be reported to the designated safety contact. SAE forms will be provided to each clinical 
site.  The information collected will include a minimum of the following: protocol number, Investigator information, patient number, event term, a narrative description of the event including its start date, and an assessment by [CONTACT_162063].  A 
sampl e of the SAE form can be found in the study manual. The Medical Monitor or Synergy may request 
follow up infor mation regarding the SAE.  
The Investigator will prepare or directly oversee preparation of each SAE report and the Medical Monitor will evaluate and confirm the seriousness and the causal relationship of the event to study treatment. In 
addition, the Investigator and Medical Monitor will evaluate the expectedness according to the reference document (Investigator Brochure).  Based on the Medical Monitor’s and Sponsor’s assessment of the event, a decision will be made concerning the need for further action.  
All SAEs will be collected and reported from signing of ICF until the end of the study. Serious AEs occurring after the end of the study and coming to the attention of the Investigator must be reported only if 
they are considered (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]) causally related to the study drug.

• Patient identification (randomization number, initials, NOT patient name)  
• Protocol number  
• Description of S AE 
• Causality assessment, if possible  
However, as far as possible all points on the SAE form should be covered in the initial report, or the 
completed SAE form itself must be faxed to the designated Safety Contact.  In addition, the event must be documented in the eCRF.  
After receipt of the initial report, the Safety Contact [CONTACT_162064], if necessary, contact [CONTACT_737], to obtain further information for assessment of the event.  
All SAEs must be reported by [CONTACT_95873]/IEC in writing, as well as appropriate regulatory authorities as required by [CONTACT_2371].  The CRO Safety Center will be responsible for all information processing and reporting according to local legal re quirements.  
7.6 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs experienced by a patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until :  
• the AE (including abnormal laboratory values) has resolved or have returned to baseline or 
stabilized at a level acceptable to the Investigator and Medical Monitor , 
• there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed , 
• the patient is lost to follow -up, or  
• the patient has died.  
7.7 Pregnancy  
Every effort should be made to avoid pregnancy in this study. Female patients should be reminded at every visit to use appropriate birth control methods. However, if a female patient should become pregnant 
during the study (i.e., from the date the ICF was signed until the patient’s last visit), the Investigator (or 
authorized delegate) should notify the designated Safety Contact [CONTACT_162065] 24 hours  of the Investigator (or authorized delegate) first becoming aware of the pregnancy.   
The notification of pregnancy should be submitted using the initial Pregnancy Report Form.  The initial 
Pregnancy Report Form should be completed with study patient’s details (e.g., patient number, initials, 
date of birth, investigational product information, etc.).  Whenever possible, the initial notification of pregnancy should include detailed information on the pregnancy, including last menstrual period and/or expected date of delivery.  If pregnancy is to be terminated, the anticipated date of termination should be provided.  If a maternal AE is reported during the initial notification of pregnancy, the details of the AE 
should also be described in the narrative field of the initial Pregnancy Report Form.  
The Sponsor, Medical Monitor, or designated Safety Representative will request permission to follow the 
patient’s progress with the doctor medically responsible for the pregnancy.  If additional information on 
the progress of the pregnancy and/or any maternal AE is received by [CONTACT_977], the Investigat or (or 
designee) should also submit a pregnancy outcome report form to the designated Safety Contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information.  If the outcome of the pregnancy is reported as premature birth, or as elective termination due to a medical reason or as spontaneous or accidental miscarriage, the details of the outcome should be described in the narrative section of the pregnancy outcome report form.

Protocol SP304203 -06 CONFIDENTIAL  
  
 
Final Version 3.0  40 of 54  July 21, 201 6   
 The pregnancy outcome will generally be reported as a follow -up report.  Details of bi rth/delivery, 
including date of birth, weight and sex of the fetus/new born should also be described in the narrative field 
of the Pregnancy Report Form.  
Pregnancy itself is not an AE, unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_162039] a contraceptive medication. Pregnancy reports, however, are tracked and reported in the safety (SAE) database.  Pregnancy occurring in the patient between start of 
study drug until [ADDRESS_188113] dose will fall under the expedited reporting procedure for serious adverse events.  The pregnant patient will be immediately discontinued from the study but will be followed for the duration of the pregnancy.  Details of the outcome of the pregnancy (e.g., full -term normal delivery, 
stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and miscarriage) will be collected and reported by [CONTACT_779].  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Complete a new SAE Report Form if the delivery outcome meets the criteria for  a SAE (e.g., congenital anomaly/birth defect, still birth, some other 
sickness, etc.). The SAE Report Form should be completed with study patient’s details (e.g., patient number, initials, date of birth, investigational product information, etc.) and the details of the fetal SAE should be described in the narrative field of the SAE Report Form.  The initial SAE Report Form must be faxed by [CONTACT_162066] [ADDRESS_188114] on the pregnancy outcome report form within 30 days after he/she has gained 
knowledge of the normal delivery or elective abortion. 
8 STATI STICAL METHODS  
Evaluation of the safety of once daily (QD) plecanatide over up to 53 weeks of dosing will be based on 
the occurrence of TEAEs (treatment -emergent adverse events) and assessment of: vital signs, clinical 
laboratory tests, physical examinations and ECGs.  Tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_162067], AE -free days, and continued participation in the trial.   
A formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and include details of all statistical methods to be 
used to analyze the long- term safety and tolerability of plecanatide. The SAP will supersede the protocol 
with respect to the analyses specified, although the general approach described in this section will remain 
unchanged.  
8.1 Treatment Assignment  
This is a  long-term safety and tolerability study that will be conducted at approximately 250 clinical study 
centers.  Approximately  1500 patients will be assigned to receive plecanatide ( 6 mg QD).

 8.3 Analysis Populations  
The following populations will be assessed:  
• Safety:  All enrolled patients who have received at least one dose of the study drug.  All safety 
analyses will be based upon the Safety Population.  
• Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT): All enrolled patients who have had at least one dose of study 
drug and who have at least one post -baseline PGA assessment.  This will be the main population 
for assessment of patient -reported outcomes .   
If considered necessary, further populations may be defined in the SAP.  
8.[ADDRESS_188116] deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum values.  Where data are collected over time, both the observed data 
and change from baseline will be summarized at each time point.  For all analyses, data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_31463]- label treatment.  
8.5 Missing Data Conventio ns 
In general, data will not be imputed.  Details of the missing data methodology will be provided in the SAP.  
8.6 Baseline Definition  
Baseline values will be defined from the assessments collected at  Visit 1 ( Day 1; B aseline visit) . 
8.6.1  Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data and other baseline characteristics, medical history  (ongoing AEs from previous trial) , 
and concomitant medication will be summarized by [CONTACT_64161].  
8.7 Patient -Reported Outcomes  
8.7.1  Patient Questionnaire s  
Three patient self -reported questionnaires will be administered during study visits to assess the patient’s 
overall IBS symptoms, treatment satisfaction and desire for treatment continuation. These patient 
questionnaires (see Appendix 1 ) will be administered preferably prior to any other study assessments.  
• Patient’s Assessment of Relief of IBS symptoms, collected at all visits, will be rated on a 5-point 
scale where 2=Significantly Relieved, 1=Moderately Relieved,  0=Unchanged,  -1=Moderately worse, 
-2 =Significantly Worse.  
• Patient’s Treatment Satisfaction Assessment , collected at all visits except Visit 1, will be 
measured on a 5- point scale where 1=Not at all satisfied, 2=A little satisfied, 3=Moderately satisfied, 
4=Quite satisfied, 5=Very satisfied. 
• Patient’s Treatment Continuation Assessment, collected at the last study visit (Visit 6 or Early 
Withdrawal), will be measured on a 5- point scale where 1=Not at all likely, 2=A little likely, 
3=Moderately likely, 4=Quite likely, 5=Very lik ely 
The change from baseline will be summarized for each post -baseline assessment.

 All assessments will be summarized using descriptive statistics on observed data.  Additional exploratory 
analyses such as linear mixed- effects  models may be performed on the above assessments. Full details 
will be provided in the SAP.  
8.8 Tolerability  
Tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_162067], AE -free days, and 
continued participation in the trial .  Full d etails will be provided in the SAP.  
8.9 Safety Analyses  
Evaluation of the safety of once daily (QD) plecanatide over 53 weeks of dosing will be based on the 
occurrence of TEAEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, physical examinations  and ECGs  as 
recorded in the clinical database.   The safety analyses will use the Safety Population defined in Section  
8.3. 
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classifications 
with reference to system organ class and preferred terms.  While all AEs will be listed, only TEAEs will be included in summary tables. Summaries of TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_162068].  Tabular summaries will include frequency of TEAEs overall and by [CONTACT_162069].  Incidence rates by [CONTACT_9702]- time will also be presented. TEAEs leading to treatment 
interruption, withdrawal from treatment, and SAEs will be presented separately.  
Out of range laboratory tests, ECGs and vital signs of potential clinical importance will also be summarize d.  A listing of patients with at least [ADDRESS_188117].  
Hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis absolute values and, where applicable, changes from baseline for each of the laboratory assessments will be presented over time.  An additional listing will be produced of clinically significant laboratory parameters. Shift tables will also be produced.  
Changes in vital signs and ECG evaluations will be presented. Absolute values and changes from 
baseline for each parameter will be presented, where applicable.  
Concomitant medications will be auto- encoded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
(WHODD ) coding system with reference to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification 
System text and preferred terms. Summaries of concomitant medication will be presented by [CONTACT_95891].  Prior and concomitant medications will be presented separately.  
All physical examination findings will be presented in the data listing.  
8.10 Interim Analys es 
No interim analyses are planned.  
9 ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPEC TS 
 
9.1 Data Quality Assurance  
 
The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee will inform the Investigator of responsibilities and the procedures for 
ensuring adequate and correct documentation.  
 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to 
record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant.  All information 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304203 -[ADDRESS_188118] be consistent with the patients’ source documentation (i.e., 
medical records).  
9.1.1  Database Management and Quality Control  
All data generated by [CONTACT_162070].  Data from external sources (such as laboratory  data) will be imported into the database.   Once 
the eCRF  clinical data have been submitted to the central server at the independent data center, 
corrections to the data fields will be captured in an audit trail.  The reason for change, the name [CONTACT_162081], together with the time and date will be logged to provide an audit trail.  
Computerized data check programs and manual checks will identify any clinical data discrepancies for resolution.  If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or data manager will raise a 
query in the electronic data capture (EDC) application.   The appropriate staff at the clinical site will 
answer queries sent to the site.  The name [CONTACT_95904], and time and date stamp will be captured to provide an audit trail.  Once all source data verification is complete and all 
queries are closed, the data manager will freeze the eCRF page.  
The specific procedures to be used for data entry and query resolution using the EDC  will be provided to 
investigative sites in a manua l e.g., eCRF Completion Guidelines. In addition, clinical site personnel will 
receive training on the EDC  system, including the eCRF.  
9.2 Electronic Case Report Forms and Source Documentation  
All data obtained during this study should be entered in to the EDC system promptly.  All source 
documents from which eCRF entries are derived should be placed in the patient’s medical records.  
Measurements for which source documents are usually available include laboratory assessments and ECG recordings.   
Data that are entered directly into the EDC system (i.e., for which there is no prior written or electronic 
record of data) are considered to be source data.    
All eCRF entries for each patient may be checked against source documents at the clinical site by [CONTACT_162071].  Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be discussed with the Investigator or 
designated site staff for resolution.  
9.2.1  Data Collection  
The Investigators (and appropriately authorized staff) will be given access to an online, web- based EDC  
system which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant.  This system is specifically designed for the collection of the 
clinical data in electronic format.  Access and rights to the EDC  system will be carefully controlled and 
configured according to each individual’s role throughout the study.  In general, only the Investigator and 
authorized staff will be able to enter data and make corrections in the eCRFs.  
The eCRF should be completed for each patient included in the study and should reflect the latest 
observations on the patients participating in the study.  It is recommended that a patient’s CRF is created 
in EDC as soon as the patient completes informed consent to reserve the patient’s assigned Subject ID in the system.  Then, all applicable eCRF pages are to be completed as soon as possible, i.e., during or 
immediately after the patient’s visit or assessment.  The expectation is that sites will complete data 
entry within 48 hours of a patient visit.

Final Version 3.0  44 of 54  July 21, 201 6   
 For patients who do not qualify for the study, only the following eCRF pages need to be completed in 
EDC: Informed Consent/Demographics , Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  and disposition page.  All other forms 
are not required and should be marked as “Not Collected” in EDC , although sites are expected to have all 
source documentation supporting the patient’s status  available on site for review by [CONTACT_2037].   
The Investigator must attest that all data entries in the eCRF are accurate and correct.  If some 
assessments  cannot be done, or if certain information is unavailable, not applicable, or unknown, the 
Investigator (or designee) should indicate this in the eCRF.  
Computerized data- check programs and manual checks will identify any clinical data discrepancies for 
resolution.  Corresponding queries will be loaded into the system and the clinical site will be informed 
about new issues to be resolved on- line.  All discrepancies will be solved online directly by [CONTACT_162072].  Data managers and clinical site monitors will be available to assist 
sites in resolving queries.  Offline edit checks will be done to examine relationships over time and across panels to facilitate quality data.  
After completion of data entry and cleaning, the Investigator  will be required to electronically sign off on 
the clinical data collected in the eCRF.  
9.3 Access to Source Data  
During the study, a site monitor will visit clinical site s to review protocol compliance, compare eCRF 
entries and individual patient medical records, assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is 
being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.   eCRF entries will be verified with source 
documentation.  The review of medical records will be carried out giving due consideration to data 
protection and patient confidentiality.   
Checking of the eCRF entries for completeness and clarity, and cross -checking with source documents, 
will be required to monitor the progress of the study.  Moreover, regulatory authorities, IRBs, and/or the Sponsor’s Quality Assurance Group (or designee) may wish to carry out such source data checks and/or 
on-site audit inspections.  Direct access to source data will be required for all monitoring visits,  
inspections and audits ; they will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical 
confidentiality .  The Investigator and authorized staff assure monitors, inspectors or auditors and the 
Sponsor  of full access to study data and files and the necessary  support of site personnel at all times.   
9.4 Data Processing  
All data will be entered by [CONTACT_162073]/eCRF as detailed in Section 9.2.1 .  
The Data Management Plan for the study includes specifications for consistency and plausibility checks 
on data and also includes data- handling rules for obvious data errors.  Unresolved queries will be shared 
with the study monitors for resolution with the Investigator or designated site personnel.  The database will be updated on the basis of electronically -signed corrections.  
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the WHODD, which employs the ATC classification system.  Medical history/current medical conditions and AEs will be coded using the MedDRA terminology.   
The versions of the coding dictionaries will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and the Clinical Study Report (CSR).

 9.5 Archiving Study Records  
According to International Conference on Harmoni sation (ICH) guidelines, essential documents should  be 
retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_188119].  Ten 
years is the recommended storage duration to ensure compliance with ICH requirements.  However, 
these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_162074].  
9.6 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and Investigator abide by [CONTACT_162075]. The study also will be carried 
out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_162040] . 
9.7 Informed Consent  
Before each patient is admitted to the study, informed consent will be obtained from the patient (or his/her legally authorized representative) according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country.  The informed consent form (ICF) must be dated and retained by [CONTACT_138984].  The Investigator will not undertake any investigation specifically required only for the 
clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.  The terms of the consent and when it was obtained 
must also be documented in the EDC  system.  
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the 
protocol.  If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_19821], and signed by 
[CONTACT_162076] y participating  in the study.  
9.8 Protocol Approval and Amendment 
Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will be approved by [CONTACT_5040], in accordance with local legal requirements.  The Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal 
requirements have been met before the first patient participates  in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly.  To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, receive 
approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive IRB approval prior to implementation (if 
appropriate).  Following approval, the protocol amendment(s) will be submitted to the Investigational New 
Drug (IND) application under which the study is being conducted.  
Administrative changes (not affecting the patient benefit/risk ratio) may be made without the need for a formal amendment  but must be submitted to the applicable IRB/IEC .  All amendments will be distributed 
to all protocol recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with appropriate instructions.  
9.9 Duration of the Study  
Once enrolled (on Day 1), the planned duration of the patient’s participation in the study is 53 weeks  or 
371 days  (378 including the permitted window) .  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304203 -[ADDRESS_188120] to patients if the study continues, the study may be terminated after 
appropriate consultation between the relevant parties.  The study may also be terminated early at the Sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a finding.  
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to enrolled patients . 
• Failure to enroll  patients at an acceptable rate.  
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the study 
drug.  
Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue, terminate or suspend the study upon submission of the New 
Drug Application to the FDA. If discontinued, terminated or suspended Sponsor will inform (1) the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_162041], (2) the FDA and (3) the IRB of the discontinuation, termination or 
suspension and the reason(s) therefore.  
The Sponsor may also terminate the study when its enrollment, regulatory and study drug exposure 
objectives have been met.  Consequently, not all enrolled patients will receive 53 weeks of treatment.  
9.11 Confidentiality  
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential.  The Investigator and members of 
his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor.  
The anonymity of participating patients must be maintained. Patients will be identified on eCRFs and other documents submitted to the Sponsor (or designee) by [CONTACT_95898], initials, and/or birth date, not by [CONTACT_2300].  Documents not to be submitted to Sponsor (or designee) that identify the patient 
(e.g., the signed informed consent) must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_737].  
9.12 Other Ethical and Regulatory Issues  
If a significant safety issue is identified, either from an individual case report or review of aggregate data, 
then the Sponsor will issue prompt notification to all parties: Regulatory Authorities, Investigators and 
IRBs.  
A significant safety issue is one that has a significant impact on the course of the clinical study or program 
(including the potential for suspension of the development program or amendments to protocols) or 
warrants immediate update of informed consent  and the Investigator Brochure.

 Appendix 3: Summary of American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Guidelines for Colon 
Cancer Screening1 and Surveillance2  
 
The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) colon cancer screening and surveillance guidelines recommendations as they apply to the study protocol:  
 
Patients of average risk aged [ADDRESS_188137] had polyps identified (and removed) on a previous screening colonoscopy should undergo surveillance at an accelerated interval (i.e., <10 years) depending on the number, size and histology of the identified polyps. For example, a patient who had >3 and <10 tubular adenomas identified 
should undergo a follow -up colonoscopy 3 years from the initial colonoscopy during which the polyps 
were identified (See AGA publication for further details).  
  Patients who have a first -degree relative with colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps diagnosed before 
age [ADDRESS_188138] had a 
colonoscopy with negative findings during the 5 years before the Screening Visit. This applies to patients 
who are ≥ 40 years old and to patients < 40 years old who are ≤ [ADDRESS_188139] had 
a colonoscopy with negative findings during the 10 years before the Screening Visit. This applies to 
patients who are ≥ 40 years old and to patients < 40 years old who are ≤ [ADDRESS_188140] had a colonoscopy with negative findings after the onset of the alarm symptoms and during the five years before the Screening Visit. Alarm symptoms 
include lower GI bleeding (rectal bleeding or heme- positive stool), iron- deficiency anemia, unexplained 
clinically -significant weight loss, and systemic signs of infection or colitis.

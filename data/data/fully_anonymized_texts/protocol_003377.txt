develop clusters of training sites geographically removed from the primary teaching facilities at FHC in 
Brooklyn, NY, thus ensuring educational equity across geography .  
 
In addition to the traditionally low -income, racial/ethnic minority, and immigrant patient populations of 
community health centers (CHCs), the Division of Dental Medicine  places dental residents in Indian Health

as part of the didactic training program, in addition to clinical experiences at each specific training site. 
Currently, distance learning is delivered through both synchronous (e.g., live interactive video 
teleconferencing) and asynchron ous (e.g., on -line educational modules) methodologies.   
 
Tele-dentistry . Dental provider  shortages, remoteness, funding challenges , and decreased  costs, coupled 
with advances in technology , have increased interest in the use of tele -medicine applications.[ADDRESS_306349] also made it possible to achieve partial or 
complete management remotely, even at distances of thousands of miles from  health care centers or dental

Cancer risk s in low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and  immigrant communities.  Cancer risks are 
compounded in  low-income, racial/ethnic minority, and  immigrant communities by [CONTACT_251974], cultural, economic, and social barriers. Acculturation also plays 
a key role in health status and promotion , as immigrants who have lived in the [LOCATION_002] for longer 
periods of time and possess higher degrees of acculturation may have different lifestyles than those who 
report fewer years of US residence or lesser degrees of acculturation.6,[ADDRESS_306350] of group welfare.8 
Friends, neighbors, and family members are often accessed and consulted before turning to formal health 
care services ,8 which may delay the identification and diagnosis of oral lesions, e specially in remote CHCs 
which often lack oral pathology expertise.

The SOPROCARE is intended for clinical practice of general dentistry, as an aid in the diagnosis of pit and 
fissure caries, as an aid to highlight d ental plaque and gingival inflammations (restricted to gingival 
inflammations which lead to bleeding upon probing) and as intra -oral camera to visualize anatomical details 
that are invisible to the naked eye or with a mirror (thanks to its magnification). In CARIO mode, the camera 
helps the dental practitioner to highlight carious warning on pi[INVESTIGATOR_251963]. In DAYLIGHT mode, the camera enables you to visualize anatomical details invisible to the naked 
eye or with a mirro r (thanks to its magnification). In PERIO mode, the camera helps the dental practitioner

of integrating a tele -mentoring component into the identification of oral lesions at the  6 dental clinics of 
Family Health Centers at NYU Langone (FHC), a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Brooklyn, 
NY.  
 
The tele-mentoring intervention involves  training dental faculty member  subjec s and resident  subjec ts to 
use intraoral cameras  to take photographs of oral lesions and place them in the Dentrix electronic health 
record (EHR), along with descriptions of the lesions. This information will then be sent via Dentrix EHR to 
Robert B. Bowe, DDS, the Director of Oral Pathology at NYU Lang one Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – Brooklyn, and an initial 
dummy code entry will be placed in the Dentrix EHR. For each patient with a detected lesion, [CONTACT_251993] will 
then review the Dentrix EHR chart and the uploaded photograph(s) of the lesion(s) found and place his 
observa tions in the Dentrix EHR. Next, [CONTACT_251993] will discuss his findings with the involved dental faculty 
member / dental resident via secure NYU Langone Health e -mail. The dental provider will then enter an apt 
comment in the Dentrix EHR, using the following te mplate: “Reviewed entry and contact[CONTACT_251978]. Follow -
up appointment needed / not needed (+ date) for an appointment on (date).” A second dummy code entry 
will then be placed in the patient chart in the Dentrix EHR. Once a week, [CONTACT_251993] will receive a Den trix 
EHR report with the 2 affiliated dummy codes for the tele -mentoring pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and assure that entries for 
both codes are entered, and the loop is closed.  
 
Using a mixed -methods approach, we will evaluate and enhance  the feasibility and acceptability of 
integrating a tele -mentoring component into the identification of oral lesions at the 6 FHC dental clinics . 
This will be achieved through:  
 
1. Administering p rovider surveys (n=12) that consist of a checklist of [ADDRESS_306355] s at each of the 6 FHC 
dental sites if each one was covered.  
 
2. Conducting s emi-structured interviews (n= 6) with dental resident  subject s at each of the 6 FHC 
sites to assess specific barriers to sustaining the intervention and strategies for addressing th ese 
barriers to facilitate integration of the intervention into the routine workflow of the dental clinics. 
The interviews will be informed  by [CONTACT_251979] 
(CFIR)1 and the Implementation Outcomes Framework (IOF).2 
 
3. Administering brief exit interviews (n= 30) with patient  subject s at each of the 6 FHC dental sites 
regarding the acceptability of the int ervention. The survey will assess patient satisfaction with the 
use of intraoral cameras at chairside to screen for and  refer patients with oral lesions and 
identification of these oral lesions via tele -mentoring with an oral pathology expert ([CONTACT_251993]) .

provider will th en enter an apt comment in the Dentrix EHR, using the following template: 
“Reviewed entry and contact[CONTACT_251978]. Follow -up appointment needed / not needed (+ date) for 
an appointment on (date).” A second dummy code entry will then be placed in the patient chart in 
the Dentrix EHR. Once a week, [CONTACT_251993] will receive a Dentrix EHR report with the [ADDRESS_306358] items (80%) by [CONTACT_251980] s will be considered as the feasibility criterion. 
Specifically, we will estimate the average checklist endorsement score across all providers with its 
associated 95% confidence interval (CI); if the upper bound of the CI exceeds 80%, we will consider the 
process feasible.  
 
Moreover, we will allow for open -ended collection of feedback on the feasibility of using the intraoral 
cameras for identification of oral lesions as part of the te le-mentoring intervention . Semi -structured 
interviews will also be condu cted with dental resident  subject s. We anticipate conducting 6 interviews before 
obtaining data saturation. The questions will be informed by [CONTACT_251981].  
4.2.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
Acceptability will be assessed using patient exit interviews (PEIs)  conducted right after the dental visit is 
completed .

five statements on patient satisfaction with the intraoral cameras and the overall tele -mentoring 
intervention  that will constitute the PEI. Patients will be asked the extent to which they agree with each 
statem ent (e.g., “ Dentists should discuss with me ways to prevent and screen for oral cancer. ”) (strongly 
agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). The acceptability criterion of the intervention will be that 80% 
or more of patients rate all five administered acceptability questions as “strongly agree” or “agree.” We will 
evaluate acceptability as described above for feasibility.

Procedural Intervention   
 
The SOPROCARE is intended for clinical practice of general dentistry, as an aid in the diagnosis of pit 
and fissure caries, as an aid to highlight dental plaque and gingival inflammations (restricted to gingival 
inflammations which lead to bleeding upon probin g) and as intra -oral camera to visualize anatomical 
details that are invisible to the naked eye or with a mirror (thanks to its magnification). In CARIO mode, 
the camera helps the dental practitioner to highlight carious warning on pi[INVESTIGATOR_251968]. In DAYLIGHT mode, the camera enables you to visualize anatomical details invisible to 
the naked eye or with a mirror (thanks to its magnification). In PERIO mode, the camera helps the dental 
practitioner to see the presence of dental plaque but also to highlight gingival inflammations  
(restricted to gingival inflammations which lead to bleeding upon probing). This mode offers to the dentist 
and/or hygienist a tool for an improved communication, motivation and education of his/h er patients, who 
will then become aware of their oral health condition.  
 
MORE INVENTIVE. PATENTED AUTOFLUORESCENCE TECHNOLOGY.  
The ACTEON® imaging team has patented a technology based on the principle of autoﬂuorescence.  
ACTEON® intraoral cameras provide a  real-time ﬂuorescence signal of the tooth superimposed on its 
anatomical image, revealing invisible tissues.  
 
SELECTIVE CHROMATIC AMPLIFICATION.  
Due to the combination of blue light absorption by [CONTACT_251982]ﬁcation, 
SOPROCARE® improves visibility of all areas of tissue inﬂammation.

6.2 Study Procedural Intervention(s) Description  
The tele -mentoring intervention involves training dental faculty members and residents to use intraoral 
cameras to take photographs of oral lesions and place them in the Dentrix electronic health record (EHR), 
along with descriptions of the lesions. This information will then be sent via Dentrix EHR to Robert B.  
Bowe, DDS, the Director of Oral Pathology at NYU Langone Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – Brooklyn, and an initial dummy 
code entry will be placed in the Dentrix EHR. For each patient with a detected lesion, [CONTACT_251993] will then 
review the Dentrix EHR chart and the uploaded phot ograph(s) of the lesion(s) found and place his 
observations in the Dentrix EHR. Next, [CONTACT_251993] will discuss his findings with the involved dental faculty 
member / dental resident via secure NYU Langone Health e -mail. The dental provider will then enter an 
apt comment in the Dentrix EHR, using the following template: “Reviewed entry and contact[CONTACT_251978]. 
Follow -up appointment needed / not needed (+ date) for an appointment on (date).” A second dummy 
code entry will then be placed in the patient chart in the  Dentrix EHR. Once a week, [CONTACT_251993] will receive 
a Dentrix EHR report with the [ADDRESS_306366]  subjects  will administer the study during participating patient routine dental 
visits.

dental clinics (n=12)  after screening at least [ADDRESS_306369] reached our target of 30 patient participants ( 5 
patient  participants at each of the 6 FHC dental sites) , we will engage 6 dental residents (1 at each of the 
6 FHC dental clinics)  in a semi -structured interview to assess specific barriers they have enc ountered to 
sustaining the intervention and strategies for addressing those barriers to facilitate integration of the tele-
mentoring intervention into the routine workflow of the dental clinics.  
 
Acceptability of the integrated intervention will be assesse d through brief patient exit surveys. Consented 
participants will be asked to complete a brief patient exit survey at the end of their dental appointments after 
being screening for oral cancer lesions using an intraoral camera .

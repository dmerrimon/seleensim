Investigator(s): Karen M. Winkfield, MD, PhD; Doris Brown, MD, PhD 
Study Period: Estimated screening expected to start March 2018; Expected completion September 2018 
Phase of Development: Design & Development (Phase 3 of Design Control) 
Objective(s): 
Primary: 
• To assess feasibility (compliance ofuse) 
• Collect data for designing a larger future trial evaluating KeraStat Cream 
Secondary: 
• To assess the safety and tolerability ofKeraStat Cream in subjects at risk ofradiation dermatitis 
• To assess the effectiveness of KeraStat Cream compared to standard of care to manage the symptoms of 
radiation dermatitis in subjects being treated with radiation therapy 
• To estimate amount ofKeraStat Cream used per patient and coverage on skin 
Methodology: This is a randomized, open label study. 
Number of Subjects: 
Sufficient subjects will be screened and enrolled such that 24 total subjects, 12 subjects per treatment group, will 
complete the study through the Follow-Up Visit. With 12 participants in each treatment group, we will be able to 
calculate a 95% confidence interval around the compliance rate in each group with a maximum margin of error of 
0.283. Comparisons between groups for effectiveness will have [ADDRESS_78102] effectiveness. 
Study Overview: 
Study Periods: 
The length of study participation for a subject is about 8-12 weeks, depending on the length of radiation 
treatment. The study will extend 4-6 weeks beyond the end of radiation therapy. The study will begin with a 
Screening Visit during treatment planning followed by [CONTACT_72018], and a follow 
up visit 4-6 weeks after completion of therapy . There is a total of 5-7 visits. 
Study Assessments: 
At the Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit 1, Week 0), following informed consent, initial eligibility will be verified 
per the inclusion/exclusion criteria and demographics and brief medical history will be collected. Subjects will 
be randomized to receive standard of care or KeraStat Cream. A physical exam and photograph of the area to be 
irradiated will be obtained, and subjects will complete the De1matology Life Quality Index. 
During the course of radiation therapy (4-6 weeks) and for the duration of the post RT treatment period (4-week 
follow up), subjects will complete a daily diary detailing symptoms and treatment details. Weekly from week [ADDRESS_78103] for radiation dermatitis by [CONTACT_72019]-Induced Acute Skin Toxicity scores and taking photographs. The same evaluation will be

4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background Effective Date: 
.Ol Ql 2QHr .3-1 -.10 l<a" CWo?3Mad8' 
Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective intervention for treating breast cancer. The primary 
mechanism of action of RT is to create enough DNA damage within each tumor cell to prevent 
replication and ultimately induce programmed cell death. This mechanism extends beyond the targeted tumor to normal surrounding tissue. This field effect can be visualized by [CONTACT_72022] a treatment portal. Approximately 85% of patients undergoing RT experience a moderate-to-severe skin reaction 
1• The disturbance of the cutaneous barrier 
function can significantly impact both health-related quality of life and the course of treatment2• 
If the skin reaction is severe enough, a treatment break may be recommended3. Managing the 
symptoms associated with skin reactions is important for ensuring completion of RT in a timely 
ma~er and increasing patient self-esteem2• Current skin care recommendations typi[INVESTIGATOR_72004]-fragrant, hypo-allergenic moisturizers2. 
KeraStat Cream is a non-sterile, non-implantable, emulsion-based wound dressing intended to 
act as a protective covering in the management of a variety of minor skin wounds and first and 
second degree (partial thiclmess) burns as well as skin undergoing radiation treatment. KeraStat 
Cream uses human hair-derived keratin proteins and is applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_72005], provide a moist environment, and create an environmental barrier supportive of 
healing. 
All ingredients have been used in FDA-approved products. A biological safety profile has been 
established for the keratin protein ingredient in KeraStat Cream. Biocompatibility studies were 
chosen and performed in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE]-1 :2007, "Biological Evaluation of Medical 
Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing ." This testing included a full toxicological risk 
assessment per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_78112] (RIPT) to evaluate the 
irritation/sensitization potential of the product when applied to uncompromised skin. No adverse 
skin reactions were observed in [ADDRESS_78113] (SPT). The results 
of the SPT demonstrated that there 
was no humoral immune response to keratin and supported pre-clinical testing, which determined that the product would not elicit an immune response. 
The current study is considered a nonsignificant risk (NSR) device study according to Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) guidance and does not require an Investigational Device Exemption 
(IDE) in advance of study conduct. NSR device studies must follow the abbreviated 
requirements presented in 21 CFR 812.2(b) related to label\ng, Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
approval, informed consent, monitoring, records, rep01is, and prohibition against promotion.

Although well tolerated by [CONTACT_72023], about 30% of patients undergoing RT develop a Grade 
2 or worse early adverse skin reaction (EASR). One study in Taiwan showed 23% of patients 
undergoing chest wall or whole breast irradiation developed moist desquamation based on the 
RTOG scale5• This scale described grade [ADDRESS_78114] desquamation / moderate erythema; Grade [ADDRESS_78115] desquamation, as defined by [CONTACT_72024] 2, from 48% to 31 % of patients, suggesting that even with advanced treatment 
techniques, a significant number of patients experience skin toxicity4• 
For this study, we will classify grade 2 or 3 skin toxicity (per the RTOG scale) as an EASR. 
Beyond the discomfort patients may experience, EASRs may result in poor patient outcomes . 
Severe EASRs can require a ''treatment break" which, in some cancers, may result in incomplete 
tumor control and greater chance of local recurrence and lower survival rates. In addition to the 
potential impact on cancer outcomes, EASRs may affect patients' self-esteem due to the 
appearance of their skin and recovery time after treatment. Standard skin regimens often include 
routine application of creams or lotions in an effort to combat the dryness, prevent intenuption of 
the skin's natural barrier (e.g., cracking or flaking), and reduce the appearance of inflammation. 
Patients often begin using these creams/lotions at the start of RT. Providing patients with a 
product that moisturizes and reduces the appearance of inflammation may improve patients' 
satisfaction with their appearance as they progress tlu· ough RT treatment. 
KeraNetics has determined that this study is a non-significant risk study under 21 CPR 812.3(m). 
This device is not intended as an implant. It is not for use supporting or sustaining human life. It 
is not for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating , or treating disease or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health, and it does not otherwise present a serious 
risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Furthermore, KeraStat Cream is classified as a 
wound dressing; wound dressings are classified as nonsignificant risk devices in FDA's 
"Information Sheet Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors: Significant Risk 
and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies" published January 2006. 
5. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 
5.1. Objectives 
The primary objectives of the proposed research are to evaluate the feasibility of the use of 
KeraStat Cream and collect data to inform a larger future trial. 
The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of KeraStat Cream in subjects 
at risk of radiation dermatitis, to assess the effectiveness of KeraStat Cream and how that 
compares to the current standard of care, and to estimate the amount of KeraStat Cream used per 
patient and coverage on skin.

baseline pre-RT assessments can be completed during the radiation treatment-planning process. 
Patients are generally treated with RT Monday through Friday, with weekends and holidays off, 
for approximately [ADDRESS_78117] weekly in clinic to 
review the patient's treatment course, monitor the skin's appearance after application of KeraStat 
Skin Cream or standard of care, and answer questions. Breaks in the treatment schedule should

procedures. 
10. SCREENING ASSESSMENTS 
The following assessments will be used for screening purposes only and taken after informed 
consent is obtained. 
10.1. Demographics 
Basic demographic information will be collected from the subject. This information includes age, 
gender, and race/ethnicity. 
10.2. Medical History 
Each subject will provide a brief medical history ( e.g. history of allergic reactions to ensure they 
meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria). Study personnel will review the completed medical 
history form prior to enrolling the subject in the study. Study personnel may ask the subject for 
additional information, as necessary. 
11. STUDY ENDPOINTS

Coverage will be calculated using the compliance rate, the number of tubes of KeraStat Cream 
used, and the estimated surface area (bra size). 
11.5. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
EASR will also be assessed at four time points from the start of radiotherapy through [ADDRESS_78128] ( or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative). We will also estimate the incidence of EASR of any grade, and for 
grades [ADDRESS_78129] 
RT-induced EASR present and also calculate a 95% confidence interval around this estimate. 
11.5.1. Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure, 
body function, laboratory result ( e.g., chemistry, ECG), or worsening of a pre-existing condition 
associated temporally with the use of the test product, whether or not considered related to the 
test product. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs irrespective of 
study treatment assignment, if it satisfies any of these criteria: results in death; is life-threatening; 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]; results in persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions; or if the event results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect. All SAEs should be 
reported to the study sponsor within [ADDRESS_78130] is in the research center. All AEs/SAEs will be recorded in the 
source document and the case report form (CRF).

11.6. 
11.6.1. Relationship to Study Device 
Assessment of Causality 
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study device and the occurrence 
of each AE/SAE. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study device will be considered and 
investigated. 
The Investigator will assess causality based on the following definitions: 
• Not Related (the AE was more likely explained by [CONTACT_72028]). 
• Related (the study treatment and AE were closely related in time and the AE may be 
explained by [CONTACT_72029]: e.g., known adverse effect or recunence on re-
challenge). 
11.7. Recording Adverse Events 
When an AE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation (e.g., 
medical progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The 
Investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE in the CRF. 
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the AE based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the 
AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
11.7.1. Eliciting Adverse Event Reports 
At each visit, subjects will be asked about AEs by [CONTACT_3553] a non-leading question, such as 
"how have you been since your last visit?" or "how has the treatment been?" In this way, 
possibly milder, but clinically important, side effects of the study device can be detected. SAEs 
will be reported promptly to KeraNetics as described in the following table once the Investigator 
determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a SAE. 
11.7.2. Assessment of Intensity 
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE/SAE reported during the 
study. The assessment will be based on the Investigator's clinical judgment. The intensity of 
each AE/SAE recorded in the CRF should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities. 
• Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities. 
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities.

.o ~ 91-201s 3 , 1-,;io ,~ cwa.3 f..farl&' 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. 
11.8. Reporting Adverse Events 
An unexpected event is one that is not consistent with the subject's past medical history and is 
not evident from previous clinical experience with the test product or reasonably anticipated 
from information known about the test product. Events that are deemed serious, related, and 
unexpected involve special handling and reporting requirements to the IRB. All SAEs will be 
followed until stabilization or improvement. 
11.8.1. SAE Reporting Procedures 
Once an Investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, she/he will 
report the information as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event to the 
Sponsors within [ADDRESS_78131] all information regarding an SAE, 
he/she will not wait to receive additional information before notifying Sponsor of the event. The 
information regarding the event will be updated when additional information is received. The 
Investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial event report 
as described in Section 11.6.1. An email is the preferred method to transmit this information 
regarding a SAE to the project contact [CONTACT_72030]. In rare circumstances and in the absence 
of email equipment, notification by [CONTACT_72031], with a copy of the event details sent 
by [CONTACT_9338]. Initial notification via the telephone does not replace the need for the 
Investigator to complete the SAE report via email within 24 hours. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt 
notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_72032]. 
11.8.2. Reporting Safety Information to the IRB 
The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) / Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). 
11.8.3. Protocol Deviations Due to an Emergency or Adverse Event 
Any subject experiencing an emergency or adverse event requiring immediate medical attention 
will receive appropriate medical management by [CONTACT_72033]. These events will be reported to Sponsor as soon as possible. If the medical 
management results in departure from the study protocol, the Sponsor will be responsible for 
granting permission for the subject to continue in the trial if the subject is able to return to study 
protocol adherence in a timely fashion. If the subject cannot return to the study protocol in a 
timely fashion, then the subject will be discontinued from the study.

11.9. Follow-up of Adverse Events Effective Date: 
02a0l -201S- 3-hWl8 Cl,J:l3 Mac I'? 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject 
and provide further information to Sponsor on the subject's condition. All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_72034], will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits/contacts. 
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event 
is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow-up. Once resolved, the appropriate 
CRF entries will be updated. 
12. 
12.1. STATISTICS 
Description of Statistical Methods 
Descriptive statistics will calculated and used to inform additional device development and to 
inform a power calculation for a follow on study, if required. The completion rate will be used 
as a measure of feasibility, with participants with an average of 10 or more applications per week 
being classified as compliant. A 95% confidence interval will be calculated around the estimate 
of compliance. After summary statistics are calculated by [CONTACT_19313], at-test will be used to compare 
the two treatment groups for the effectiveness outcomes of DLQI score and RTOG score. A 
Fisher's exact test will be used to compare skin appearance issues between the groups. The 
counts for each type of adverse event will be summarized by [CONTACT_72035]. For the 
KeraStat treatment group, the mean coverage will be calculated per square centimeter. 
12.2. Sample Size 
Up to [ADDRESS_78132] 24 subjects. 
The expected accrual rate is four per month with accrual lasting approximately six months. 
Participants will be randomized equally (n=12 per group) to standard of care or KeraStat Cream. 
With 12 participants in each treatment group expected to complete the study, we will be able to calculate a 95% confidence interval around the compliance rate in each group with a maximum 
margin of error of 
O .283. Comparisons between groups for effectiveness (RTOG scale and 
DLQI score) will have [ADDRESS_78133] any completed assessments included in the data

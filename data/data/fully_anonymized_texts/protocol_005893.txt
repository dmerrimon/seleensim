Title: Virtual reality for outpatient management of cancer pain: a dosing study
BACKGROUND
Palliative care (PC) provides expert symptom management and communication skills for patients 
and families facing serious life-limiting illness. Many such patients experience negative quality of life 
(QOL) due to moderate-severe pain or other symptoms and require strong pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] – often 
controlled substances such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_54234] – to alleviate associated distress. A major 
tenet of quality supportive care is the combination of many types of therapy, both pharmacologic and 
non-pharmacologic. Patients with cancer are often interested in non-pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54235].1,2,3 
However, accessing non-pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54236]

but medications remain the mainstay of treating pain and other symptoms for patients with cancer. 
Virtual reality (VR) is a non-pharmacologic intervention that continues to demonstrate 
effectiveness in pain management. VR is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_54237] a calm, pleasant environment, providing distraction from pain and lowering pain sensation. To 
experience VR, subjects use a specially-designed headset (somewhat similar in size/structure to ski 
goggles) and equipment that introduces computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image 
or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by [CONTACT_28024]. Integration 
of interactive visual, auditory, and haptic stimuli creates a sense of “immersion” such that users feel 
they are present in the virtual environment. Early clinical research in patients undergoing painful 
procedures such as burn wound care or dental procedures shows that brief VR sessions (e.g. 3-30 
minutes) can lower self-reported pain scores, lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_54238], and improve satisfaction with pain 
management. 8,[ADDRESS_57980] RL, Christianson JB, Dusek JA. Referrals to integrative medicine in a tertiary

seem to modulate pain by [CONTACT_54259], thereby [CONTACT_54260]. 10,11 When used in addition to usual care 
(opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], with or without non-interactive distraction therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), VR has been shown to provide 
clinically and statistically significant reduction in subjective pain score ratings. 12,13 The immersive nature 
of VR makes it a more engaging form of distraction therapy compared to playing a video game or 
listening to music (e.g. rather than watching a video of a beach, one visually and acoustically experiences 
being at the beach). Additionally, VR is becoming increasingly portable and affordable with growing 
availability of thematic content such that patients may select VR experiences that interest them.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_54243], no research has yet 
elucidated its role in outpatients with cancer-related pain.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality therapy on mitigating 
moderate to severe cancer pain in outpatients. 
 
AIMS and HYPOTHESES
Specific Aim 1:  To collect and compare pi[INVESTIGATOR_54244] a VR intervention against standard 
care (pre-enrollment analgesic regimen) on pain management measures for outpatients with cancer 
who have a baseline pain self-rated at least 4/10 (0=no pain, 10=worst pain).
Hypothesis 1: Patients with cancer receiving a virtual reality (VR) intervention will have 
significantly larger improvements in self-reported pain scores, satisfaction with pain management, lower 
distress, greater well-being, and lower as-needed opi[INVESTIGATOR_54245].
Specific Aim 2: To evaluate frequency of utilization of a VR intervention in a real-world setting.
Hypothesis 2: Patients who use VR more in the setting of cancer-related pain will report lower 
self-reported numeric pain scores compared to baseline. 
Specific Aim 3: To evaluate patient satisfaction with VR intervention and overall pain management, and 
end-user VR content preferences.
Hypothesis 3: Patients who engage in VR distraction therapy will report greater acceptance of 
the intervention and satisfaction with the impact on pain experience.
STUDY SETTING
Patients who are receiving outpatient cancer care at the Washington Cancer Institute at MedStar 
Washington Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246] (MWHC). This center serves one of the most culturally diverse areas of the 
[LOCATION_002], acting as a significant healthcare resource. This site’s patient population is predominantly 
African American (>70%), with most living in low-income areas of the District and half of the patients 
with Medicaid or Medicare as their primary insurance. These populations traditionally have little to no 
access to integrative or non-pharmacologic analgesic strategies.

7/26/2022 - 7/4/[ADDRESS_57981] twice monthly to 
discuss and address potential problems, ensure timely communication with the IRB if needed, and 
monitor study accrual. Two forms of recruitment materials will be generated: 1) patient-facing 
advertisement and recruitment material that are eye-catching and written to an 8th-grade reading level. 
Content will describe the study purpose, key eligibility criteria, and contact [CONTACT_54261]. Materials will be posted in WCI clinic and community areas where patients and caregivers 
are likely to be circulating; i.e., cafeteria, lobby, waiting areas and clinic rooms; 2) provider-targeted 
correspondence summarizing key study objectives and clearly outlining eligibility criteria, period of 
enrollment, study coordinator contact [CONTACT_3031], and highlighting the ongoing nature of the study. 
These materials will be distributed to WCI faculty and hematology/oncology medical fellows. The study 
coordinator will contact [CONTACT_54262]-referral or referral by 
[CONTACT_54263]. The coordinator will screen the electronic health record to confirm eligibility, then 
schedule a time to meet with the participant. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects will be 
considered for enrollment in this study if able to provide consent, at least 18 years old, and report 
moderate-severe pain (at least 4 out of 10 where pain is rated on a Likert scale between zero and 10) in 
the previous 7 days as a result of either cancer or cancer treatment. Palliative care consultation and/or 
referral to palliative care is not required for eligibility or participation. Additionally, participation will not 
be limited by [CONTACT_54264]-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54247]. Subjects will be excluded if they already use VR for personal use, have intractable 
nausea/vomiting, history of motion sickness, history of seizures or epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], have cranial structure 
abnormalities that prevent use of VR headset, or are currently enrolled in a palliative care or pain 
management study. Subjects will also be excluded if they have limited vision or vision defects that are 
not corrected with prescription eyeglasses, or if participants are unable or do not wish to wear required 
corrective eyeglasses with the VR headset. Informed consent will be conducted before enrolling each 
patient.
This is a non-randomized, unblinded dose-titration study. After consenting to participate, in 
addition to usual pharmacologic pain management, participants will receive 1 week of VR daily for 10 
minutes per session, then 1 week of VR twice a day for 10 minutes per session, then 1 week of VR use as 
desired by [CONTACT_3038]. 
VR sessions will be administered using the Facebook (Facebook Inc., Menlo Park, CA) Meta 
Quest 2 VR and Touch controllers. This equipment was selected because it is portable, has built in audio, 
and has clear graphics at a lower price than VR setups that require a computer to generate graphics. The 
headset has an optional eyeglass spacer to allow participants to wear corrective eyeglasses during the

VR session if appropriate. The hand controllers facilitate immersive, interactive VR experiences. Of note, 
we considered using smartphone-based VR technology for this study; however, although technology 
continues to evolve, smartphone-based VR technology has not yet evolved enough to provide an 
adequately immersive VR experience to assure accurate results. The VR software, Nature Treks VR 
application (https://naturetreksvr.com ) that features ten non-violent, nature-based experiences in 
peaceful environments (e.g. forest, river, beach, etc.) that can be played in a seated or fixed position. A 
Facebook/Meta account is currently required to login to the Quest 2 device; to protect patient privacy 
and ensure access to the Nature Treks application, the research team will activate the device with a 
dummy Meta account that does not contain any patient-specific information or payment information 
prior to distribution to participants. Participants will be provided with information on resetting the 
device to factory settings at the end of the study period if they wish to remove the dummy account and 
access the device using a personal Meta account for future, personal use of the device. Participants will 
not be prevented from searching for or downloading other VR programs onto the device during the 
study period, but will not be able to purchase software while logged into the dummy account. 
Because of the nature of the compared interventions, subjects and researchers cannot be 
blinded to intervention. Our primary outcome measure will determine the impact of VR on self-reported 
pain score in the last week (numeric rating scale, collected weekly). Self-reported pain experience 
remains the standard for clinical pain research. Secondary outcomes will measure pain interference 
(PROMIS Pain Interference Short Form, collected weekly), as-needed opi[INVESTIGATOR_54248] (self-reported using medication administration form), 
satisfaction with VR intervention and overall pain management (collected weekly), and survey of 
preferences for VR thematic content (collected after Week 4). 
Following consent, subjects will complete baseline outcome assessments including self-reported 
pain score in the last week, the PROMIS Pain Interference Short Form, as-needed opi[INVESTIGATOR_54249], and satisfaction with overall pain management. Subjects will then be provided with a 
VR headset and paired Touch controllers to bring home for the duration of the study and instructions on 
the frequency of use for each week. A member of the research will educate the patient on the 
technology and assure comfort with use. The research study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_54265], collect 
self-reported pain score in the last week, the PROMIS Pain Interference Short Form, as-needed opi[INVESTIGATOR_54250], and satisfaction with the VR intervention and overall pain 
management. Additionally, participants will be surveyed on preferences for VR thematic content at the 
end of Week 3. 
Participants will be monitored for adverse effects and harm for the duration of the study. 
Although well tolerated in previous studies of patients with cancer and advanced heart failure, potential 
risks may include dizziness, nausea, eye strain, and loss of confidentiality if data security is breached. 
Participants are instructed to only utilize the VR device while in a seated or reclined position and to 
never use the device when standing or ambulating due to the risk of potentially serious injury from 
falling.     
Participants will be compensated for their time and participation in this research; participants 
may keep the VR headset assigned to them for the study, and will receive a $[ADDRESS_57982] or damaged during the study period; a replacement device will be 
provided by [CONTACT_5051]. Participants who wish to return the device may do so at their next 
scheduled appointment for usual care at MedStar Washington Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246], where a member of the 
research team will collect it. Participants will not be required to schedule an appointment or return to 
MWHC for the purpose of returning the device. Participants who wish to return the device and are

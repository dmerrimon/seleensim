 Movement and Music Intervention for Dementia  
Deb Kegelmeyer, Anne Kloos, Douglas Scharre    
Dementia impacts 5% -7% of individuals >60 years old.[1] It impacts the 
individual’s ability to perform work, care for him/herself and ultimately leads to physical 
disability. There is a high caregiver burden associated with dementia and many 
individuals end their lives in a long -term care facility . Overall caring for individuals with 
dementia is a psychological, physical and financial burden on their loved ones and society. Average total cost of care per person with dementia ($287 038) is greater than that of person’s with cancer ($173 383).[2] Alt hough Medicare expenditures were similar 
across groups, average out -of-pocket spending for patients with dementia ($61 522) 
was 81% higher than that for individuals without dementia ($34 068).[2]   
  Best care for individuals with dementia currently involv es the use of 
cholinesterase inhibitors to slow cognitive decline. There is no curative therapy and most treatments are implemented to manage behavioral symptoms. There is evidence in both animal and human studies that exercise modifies metabolic, structur al and 
functional dimensions of the brain, even in older adults.[3] Emerging evidence points to a protective effect of exercise on cognitive function in those with mild to moderate dementia but studies are limited in design and scope and while some show benefit 
others show no impact of exercise on cognition.[3, 4]   
  Neuroplasticity requires that the correct type and dosage of exercise be applied. 
Research to date has demonstrated that individuals with mild to moderate dementia retain the ability to underg o neuroplasticity but the type of exercise and dosage needed 
are not yet clear. Studies have shown that exercise in individuals with dementia can lead to improved balance[5], strength and aerobics[6, 7] and function[4- 6]. Studies 
showing improved cognitive function included a combination of exercise and an activity 
that was cognitively challenging.[4, 5, 8] Cheng et al. (2014) demonstrated cognitive 
improvement through the use of a cognitively challenging game, Mahjong.[9] In their 
study the group who parti cipated in Tai Chi [ADDRESS_1234953] a 
slower rate of global deterioration.[9] Two studies demonstrate that optimal benefit may be obtained through the use of an exercise intervention that includes cognitively challenging activities.  Law et al. (2014) had individuals with mild cognitive impairment 
participate in functional task training or in cognitive training alone.[4] Both groups demonstrated improved cognitive function but only the functional task training group improved in functi onal status and everyday problem solving activities.[4] Lam et al. 
(2015) compared exercise, cognitive activity or both to demonstrate that the use of both exercise and cognitive training is superior to either one alone.[8]   
  It is recommended that exerc ise programs be structured, individualized, higher 
intensity, longer duration and multicomponent to bring about improvement in cognitive

 function in those with dementia.[3] Due to the current reimbursement market in the 
insurance industry individualized pr ograms are only feasible for a short duration unless 
the individual can pay out of pocket for the program. Compliance can be an issue with 
higher intensity, longer duration programs as demonstrated by [CONTACT_882676]. study in which 25% of the participants dropped out before the one year intervention ended.[8] 
This study included one hour of exercise 3 times a week for a year which was effective 
but a 25% drop out rate is concerning. The other studies demonstrating improvement in cognitive performance in indi viduals with dementia ranged from 6 –  48 sessions.[4, 5, 9] 
Exercise session length was typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 60 minutes.   
  Dance is increasingly becoming a popular form of exercise intervention for 
individuals with Parkinson disease (PD)[10- 12] and dementia[13- 16]. Dance is an 
aerobic exercise that challenges balance and involves functional transitions. In addition 
learning dance sequences is cognitively challenging. Dance is a structured, 
multicomponent exercise that can be higher intensity and thus fulfills the cr iteria laid out 
by [INVESTIGATOR_560384] -Sanchez et al. (2014) of qualities of an exercise program likely to bring about 
change in cognitive function.[3] In individuals with Parkinson disease and dementia it 
has been shown to improve motor function.[10- 12, 14- 16] In indivi duals with PD studies 
have shown improvement in cognitive function as measured by [CONTACT_243060][11, 12], the 
Brooks spatial task[12], reverse corsi block test of working memory,[12], frontal assessment battery at bedside and mental rotation task[10]. The only study  examining 
impact of dance on cognition in individuals with dementia showed slight improvement in 
mini- mental status exam scores.[16]   
  Music is an integral part of dancing and as such its impact on cognitive and 
behavioral function must be considered. S tudies show that listening to music activates 
specific areas of the brain, most associated with emotional behaviors.[17] Areas activated are the insular and cingulate cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex.[17] Listening to music  has been shown to impact behavior and 
evoke reminiscing in individuals with dementia.[18] Given its potential impact on neural 
function we propose to include a control group who will listen to live music 
performances in a group setting. The control group is proposed to elucidate potential benefits of group socialization and music and differentiate these from the potential benefits of the dance training.   
  We hypothesize that a structured dance program involving novelty and learning 
of sequences will impr ove both motor and cognitive function in individuals with mild to 
moderate dementia greater than a control intervention of social music listening. Aims of this study are to investigate the impact of dance training on 1.) Functional movements such as sit to  stand transfers and walking; 2.) Balance; and 3.) Cognitive function in 
individuals with mild to moderate dementia.   
METHODS  
PROTOCOL    IRB Protocol Number:  2016H0211  
 IRB Approval date:  04/05/2017  
  
  
 Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia will be recruited to take 
part in the study. Participants will be equally distributed into a dance training group or a 
control group who will listen to music in a group setting. Group placement will alternate unless the participant expresses a strong preference to be in a specific group.   
Inclusion Criteria  Exclusio n Criteria  
Diagnosis of dementia (mild to moderate) 
MMSE equivalent score ≥ 10  Unable to walk 10 feet unassisted  
Age > 60 years old  Presence of orthopedic disorder that 
impacts walking  
Able to follow simple instructions  Presence of other neurologi c diagnosis 
that impacts cognitive or motor function 
such as stroke, Parkinson disease or 
traumatic brain injury  
  
Enrollment  
Participants will be recruited from local neurology clinics, support groups and senior 
living communities. Potential participants will be told about the study and screened to 
determine if he/she meets inclusion/exclusion criteria using the screening form administered by a researcher. After screening the participant will be consented and then 
given the Mini Mental State Exam Equivalent (MMSE equivalent). Individuals with a 
score < 10 (severe dementia) will be disqualified and will not continue in the study.   
Outcome Assessment :  
Participants will be recruited and enrolled until there are 15 participants completed in 
each group. Baseline measures will be assessed by a trained assessor prior to start of the intervention (0- 2 weeks), intermediate assessment at [ADDRESS_1234954] -intervention 
assessment 0 -2 weeks after completing the intervention. Assessment will take 60 
minutes and will  be conducted either at a senior living community center, or at the 
MEND laboratory in Atwell Hall, Ohio State University.    
Primary Outcome Measures   
• Motor: Timed up and Go cognitive   
The timed up and go cognitive assesses the ability to stand up, wal k, turn and sit back 
down while doing a cognitive task. The individual is timed first while doing the task without a secondary cognitive task and then while doing the task and counting 
backwards from 100 in increments of 3. It is valid and reliable measure of mobility and 
dual task ability.[19]  
Cognitive: MoCA  
PROTOCOL    IRB Protocol Number:  2016H0211  
 IRB Approval date:  04/05/2017  
  
  
 The Montreal cognitive assessment is a valid and reliable screening tool for dementia 
that assesses the major cognitive domains. [20] It is a paper test that takes 5 to 10 
minutes to administer.  
Secondary Outcome Measures   
• Balance - miniBESTest   
The mini BESTest is a clinical balance assessment tool that aims to target and 
identify 6 different balance control systems that has been shown to be valid and reliable in the elderly[21]. It takes 10 –  15 minutes to administer and involves 
tests static and dynamic balance and includes the TUG cognitive.   
• Activities and Function -  Functional Rating Scale of Symptoms of Dementia (care 
partner fills out)   
A scale in which the caregiver rates the ability of the  individual with dementia 
to perform daily care activities, memory and sleep.[22]  
• Caregiver burden – Caregiver Burden Scale   
A survey tool that is a valid and reliable measure to assess perceived 
burden among people caring for others with disabilities.[23]   
  
  
Intervention:  
The dance class will be a [ADDRESS_1234955] opportunity to socialize with 
other study participants as well as members of the senior care community. Music style and type varies week to week and is chosen to be appropriate to individuals over 65 years of age.   
Statistical Analysis:  
We calculat ed the number needed based on previous studies and arrived at 15 per 
group. Given there is an expectation that some subjects will be found to not meet the

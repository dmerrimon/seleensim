Study Title: A One Year, Open -label, Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Risperidone
Implants as a Maintenance Treatment in Patients with Schizophrenia
Principal Investigator:
[INVESTIGATOR_283948], Ph.D.
Study Centers: Up to 15 centers
Countries: [LOCATION_002]
Study Period: Phase of Development:
Estimated date first subject enrolled: 15-Mar-[ADDRESS_346839] completed:  Oct -2017Phase 3
Objectives:
The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the 48-week safety and tolerability of Risperidone
Implants as maintenance therapy in subjects with schizophrenia. Safety and tolerability will be
measured by [CONTACT_283967]/impending relapse, PANSS, CGI -I,
CGI-S, adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory, physical exam and ECG findings, Abnormal
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akath isiaRating Scale (BARS), and Simpson -Angus
Scale (SAS) and Investigator assessments.
Study Design: Open -label maintenance study of two consecutiv ely administered 6 month Risperidone
Implants in the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia.
Methodology
The study consists of a Screening Period, a Conversion Phase, a 48-week Maintenance Treatment
Phase and a Follow -up Visit.
Screening Period (Up to Six Weeks):
Eligibility for the study will be determined during the Screening period. The Screening period will
include psychiatric and medical evaluations, screening tests, physical examination/medical history and
other assessments to establish whethe r the patient meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.
During the Screening period, subjects will be washed out of all prohibited concomitant medications.
Subjects receiving an antipsychotic other than oral risperidone ( 4 mg/day ), long actin grisperidone
injection (37.5 mg/dose), Invega® (6mg/day) or Invega® Sustenna® (156 mg dose) will be required to
enter the Conversion Phase.
To enter the 48-week Maintenance Treatment Phase, subjects are required to be taking only one
antipsychotic medicat ion:risperidone.  Subjects who are receiving oral risperidone (4 mg/day), long -
acting risperidone injection (37.5 mg/dose), Invega® ( 6mg/day) or Invega® Sustenna® (156 mg dose)
at the time of Screening will be eligible to directly enter the 48-week Maint enance Treatment Phase.
All other eligible subjects will enter the Conversion Phase.

Conversion Phase ( Two toSixWeeks):
During the weekly visits in the Conversion Phase, subjects will cross -titrate from other antipsychotic(s)
to oral risperidone therapy over a minimum of 2 -6weeks. The objective of the oral conversion Phase
is for all subjects to achieve an oral risperidone dose of 4 mg by [CONTACT_283968] 6of the Conversion
Phase.
Maintenance Phase ( 48Weeks):
At the beginning of the 48-week Maintenance Treatment Phase, all subjects will receive Risperidone
Implants (two , 360 mg or three , 300 mg 6-month implants ,each containing risperidone). Oral dosing
with risperidone will continue for one day after the subject has received the Risperidone Implants.
During the Maintenance Phase, subjects will be evaluated in the clinic and at any unscheduled visits
for signs of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse as defined in Section 9.3.1 .
Subjects (or their caregiver) will be contact[CONTACT_283969] -in on
the subjects in between on -site visits . The appearance of any clinically significant signs of exacerbation
of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse criteria will result in withdrawal from the trial. A dditionally,
any subject withdrawn for lack of efficacy in the Maintenance Phase per the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_283949] t he criteria for exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse.
Number of Subjects (Planned):
Screening Phase –approximately 250subjects.
Conversion Phase –It is anticipated that approximately 120subjects will enter the Conversion Phase.
Main tenance Phase –approximately 140 subjects will be implanted .
Study Population: Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined by [CONTACT_2681] -5 criteria.

Version: Final 4.0,15JUL [ADDRESS_346850] 1% of the United Sta tes (US)
population (Diagnostic , 2000). Men and women are equally affected by [CONTACT_283973] 20s whereas women usually present 10
years later in their late 20s or early 30s ( Schultz et al., 2007). The neurotransmitter dopamine is
thought to play an important role in the disease as drugs that increase dopamine
neurotransmission induce psychosis similar to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia; almost
all of the treatments for schizophrenia act to decrease dopamine neurotransmission (Freedman,
2003) .Schizophrenia is characterized by [CONTACT_283974] i s manifested in patient ’s speech and behaviors (Diagnostic, 2000) .Positive
symptoms include hallucinations, voices that converse with, or about the patient, and delusions.
Negative symptoms include lack of emotion, loss of will or drive, and social withdr awal.
Disorganized behaviors may lead to difficulty for patients to live normal lives, which includes
preparing meals, maintaining employment, or interacting with friends, family, and colleagues
(Diagnostic, 2000) .The life -long nature of schizophrenia req uires long -term treatment and
usually involves pharmacological, psychological, and psychosocial treatment strategies. The aim
of long -term treatment is to maintain symptom stability, adequately treat any increases in
symptoms, maintain or improve daily fun ction and quality of life, and to prevent relapse
(Harrison, Goa, 2004) .Patients with schizophrenia generally have impaired insight and do not
recognize that they have the illness. This lack of insight leads to poor or partial compliance with
prescribed m edication, which in turn results in reduced treatment efficacy (Urquhart, 1994) ,
earlier relapses, higher psychiatric admissions (Valenstein et al., 2002) ,reduced quality of life,
increased suicide rates (Herings, Erkends, 2003) ,and a shortened life expe ctancy ( Schultz et al.,
2007) .
One of the patient -driven reasons for noncompliance is the patient ’s inability to adhere to daily
dosing on a long -term basis. Current depot formulations of antipsychotic sonly provide
medication coverage up to one month.  A formulation such as Risperidone Implant provides
therapeutic dose levels of risperidone over [ADDRESS_346851] marketed by
[CONTACT_283975]® (IND 20 -272) and was approved
in the [LOCATION_002] in 1993 and in Europe in 2008 to treat schizophrenia (Van Peer et al., 1996 ).
The mechanism of action of risperid one is believed to be through blockade of both the serotonin
5-hydroxytryptamine receptor type 2 (5 -HT2) and dopamine type 2 receptor (D2) (Page et al.,
2010 ).
For adults with schizophrenia, the effective dose range of oral risperidone tablets is 4 to 16
mg/day with a target dose of 4 to 8 mg/day. Extensive experience with risperidone supports
favorable efficacy and tolerability with relatively little weight gain, less extrapyramidal side

Culhane, 1999) .
Risperidone Implant utilizes a novel drug delivery implant technology (polyurethane polymer
technology), that was developed by [CONTACT_283976]. in order to deliver a
wide range of drugs and s mall molecules for an extended period of time. The Risperidone
Implant is a subcutaneous implant composed of 300mgor 360 mg USP grade risperidone,
National Formulation (NF) grade croscarmellose sodium, NF grade stearic acid, and biomedical
grade polyuret hane (Tecoflex® EG -80A). Tecoflex EG -80A is an aliphatic, polyether -based
polyurethane membrane that controls the rate of risperidone release. The dimensions of the
implant are approximately 38mm long with an outside diameter of approximately 4 mm.
Risper idone is delivered systemically via passive diffusion at an anticipated release rate of 1.2 to
1.5 mg/day (based on 6 -month dog data) for a period of up to 6 months (RISI -TR-10-007, Endo
Pharmaceuticals, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, 2010 ).This release rate i s expected to result in
achieving similar steady -state trough levels from a 4 mg/day oral dose of risperidone.
The Risperidone Implant is a reservoir -type drug delivery system in which risperidone pellets are
enclosed within a sealed, cylindrical polymer m embrane, made of Tecoflex EG -80A. The
polymer membrane controls the rate of diffusion of the drug substance to provide the release
appears superficially to be a pseudo -zero-order however a more detailed analysis of models
development is presented in a separate report. The polymer membrane is not intended to exert
therapeutic effects although it acts to improve product delivery via controlled release of the drug
substance.
The proposed initial indication for the Risperidone Implant is maintenance treatment of
schizophrenia in adults. The Risper idone Implant may offer significant advantages over
risperidone oral tablets and long -acting depot formulations of antipsychotics ( i.e., Risperdal®
Consta®) including: 1) reduced pain, anxiety, and risk of infection associated with frequent IM
injections; 2) ability to remove the implant if treatment needs to be discontinued urgently, which
is not possible with the depot injectable formulation; 3) improved patient compliance, which is
expected to lead to improved functional outcomes and reduced relapse rate s and EPS; 4)
improved convenience for patients and healthcare providers due to less frequent clinic visits; and
5) reduced healthcare costs because of improved functional outcomes, reduced relapse rates,
reduced clinic visits for drug dosing, and reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].
Study EN3342 -[ADDRESS_346852] in human study of Risperidone Implants and investigated the
pharmacokinetics of a single dose strength implant (375 mg total risperidone; estimated to
deliver 1.2 -1.5 mg risperidone daily). Patients with sch izophrenia participating in the study (n=6)
were required to receive a stable [ADDRESS_346853] patient ’s implant was removed [ADDRESS_346854] -implantation and subsequent patient (n=5)
implants were left in place for 3 months.
Plasma concentration of risperidone and its active metabolite 9 -OH-risperidone were measured
at various time points to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the active moiety
(risperidone +9 -OHrisperidone) responsible for risperidone ’s clinical effects.
Safety was assessed as were pharmacodynamics measures including the Clinical Global
Impressions scale and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia.

Version: Final 4.0,15JUL 2016 Page 20of67week Maintenance Treatment Phase, subjects are required to be taking only one antipsychotic
medication: risperidone.  Subjects who are receiving oral risperidone (4 mg/day), long -acting
risperidone injection (37.5 mg/dose), Invega® ( 6mg/day) or Invega® S ustenna® (156 mg dose)
at the time of Screening will be eligible to directly enter the 48-week Maintenance Treatment
Phase.  All other eligible subjects will enter the Conversion Phase with the goal of the stabilizing
subjects on 4 mg oforal risperidone .
Subjects who achieve stability during the 2-6week Conversion Phase are eligible to enter the
Maintenance Phase and will receive Risperidone Implants (two or three 6-month implants each
containing risperidone ).
The Risperidone Implant has the ability to improve patient compliance and cantherefore
decrease the time to relapse and frequency of relapse by [CONTACT_26129] a therapeutic dose of
risperidone. Two 360 mg Risperidone Implants (720 mg total dose) will deliver, over 24 weeks ,
comparab leCminplasma levels of oral risperidone 4 mg/day. Three 300 mg Risperidone
Implants (900 mg total dose) will deliver, over 24 weeks, comparable C avgplasma levels of oral
risperidone 4 mg/day. Risperidone 4 mg/day is considered a therapeutic dose in the long term
treatment of schizophrenia.

6.1. Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the 48-week safety and tolerability of
Risperidone Implants as maintenance therapy in subjects with schizophrenia. Safety and
tolerability will be measured by [CONTACT_283967]/impending
relapse, PANSS, CGI -I, CGI -S, adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory, physical exam and
ECG findings, AIMS, BARS and SAS rating scales and Investigator assessments.
6.2. Overall Study Design and Plan
This is an open -label maintenance study of two consecutively administered 6 month Risperidone
Implants in the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia.
The study consists of a Screening period, a Conve rsion Phase, a 48-week Maintenance Treatment
Phase and a Follow -up Visit.
Screening Period (Up to Six Weeks):
Eligibility for the study will be determined during the Screening period (a maximum of 45days).
The Screening period wil l include psychiatric and medical evaluations, screening tests, physical
examination/medical history and other assessments to establish whether the patient meets the
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. During the Screening period, subjects will be washed
out of all prohib ited concomitant medications.
Subjects receiving an antipsychotic other than oral risperidone (4 mg/day), long acting
risperidone injection (37.5 mg/dose), Invega® (6mg/day) or Invega® Sustenna® (156 mg dose)
will be required to enter the Conversion Pha se.
To enter the48-week Maintenance Treatment Phase, subjects are required to be taking only one
antipsychotic medication: risperidone. Subjects who are receiving oral risperidone (4 mg/day),
long-acting risperidone injection (37.5 mg/dose), Invega® ( 6mg/day) or Invega® Sustenna®
(156 mg dose) at the time of Screening will be eligible to direct ly enter the 48-week Maintenance
Treatment Phase .All other eligible subjects will enter the Conversion Phase.
Conversion Phase (Two to Six Weeks ):
During the weekly visits in the Conversion Phase, subjects will cross -titrate from other
antipsychotic(s) to 4 mg/day of oralrisperidone therapy over 2 -6weeks. The objective of the
oralConversion Phase is for all subjects to achieve an oral risperidone dose of 4 mg/day by[CONTACT_283978] 6of the Conversion Phase.
Maintenance Phase (48Weeks):
At the beginning of the 48-week Maintenance Treatment Phase ,all subjects will receive
Risperidone Implants (two , 360mg or three , 300mg 6-month implants each containing
risperidone). Oral dosing with [ADDRESS_346859] has

Version: Final 4 .0,15JUL 2016 Page 23of676.3. Discussion of Study Design
Thestudy design is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability for Risperidone Implants in
patients with chronic schizophrenia who would benefit from long -term treatment. Two or three
Risperidone Implants are inserted every 24 weeks anddeliver comparable plasma exposure level
of oral risperidone 4 mg/day.
This is a multi -center, open -label study. Screening procedures will be completed during a period
of up to 45 days, after which, eligible subjects, aged 18 -70 years, will enter into a Conversion
Phase or the Maintenance Treatment Phase. Subjects will receive Risperidone Implant stwice for
24 weeks each. The second implant will occur in the opposite arm of the originally implanted
arm.  If the risperidone implants are expelled from the subjects ’arm, the subjects will have the
risperidone implants removed from the arm and new risperidone implants will be placed into the
opposite arm.  When the subjects return for their second implant, the subjects will have the
risperidone implants impla nted into the originally implanted arm. Subjects will be seen per the
schedule of events for the duration of the study.

prescription, excluding marijuana, will be discussed with the medical monitor. If the
subject has a second positive drug screen during the Screening Phase, the Conversion
Phase or at Maintenance Baseline , the subject will be excluded from th e trial.
18.The following laboratory test, vital sign, and ECG results are exclusionary:
a.Platelets ≤75,000/mm3
b.Hemoglobin ≤ 9g/dL
c.Neutrophils, absolute ≤1000/mm3

NOTE: Consultation with the medical monitor may allow for retesting. In addition,
subjects are excluded if they have any other clinically significant abnormal laboratory
tests, vital sign results, or ECG findings that, in the Investigator ’s judgment, are
medically significant or would impact the safety of the subject or the interpretation of the
trial results. Criteria are provided in the protocol to assist Investigators in their
assessments of results that are potentially medically significant, depending on the
subject ’s medical history and clinical presentation. Abnormal results for laboratory
parameters or vital signs will be repeated to ensure reproducibility of the abnormality
before excluding a subject based on the criteria noted above. If a repeated ECG has a
triplicate corrected QTc <470 msec for females on the correction that was initial ly >470

7.3. Qualification Criteria
Each subject will receive a subject identification number after they have signed informed
consent. The number will consist of seven digits, where the first two digits are the country
number, thesecond set of two digits isthe site number, and the third set of three digits is the
patient number. Every subject must sign informed consent prior to any study procedures being
conducted. All subjects who are consented will also have their data entered into the electronic
data capture (EDC) system. Subjects who ar e screen failures will only need to have informed
consent information, demographics, and reason for screen fail entered.
Subjects will enter either the Conversion or Maintenance Phase after all screening procedures
have been performed and eligibility to co ntinue in the study is confirmed.  Eligibility will be
assessed again at the Baseline Visit for the Maintenance Phase (the end of the Conversion Phase
Visit can also serve as the Baseline Visit for the Maintenance Phase).  Once eligibility is
confirmed, al l subjects will receive two or three Risperidone Implants on entry into the
Maintenance Phase.
7.4. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
A subject is free to withdraw his/her consent and discontinue participation in the study at any
time for any reaso n.
A subject should be considered for withdrawal from the study in the instance of occurrence of
psychotic symptom exacerbation/impending relapse in the 48-week Maintenance Treatment

to provide such a reason.
Inthe event that a subject is discontinued while at the clinical site, the early termination
procedures shown in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3)should be performe d prior to
discharge from the study site. For any case of early discontinuation (whether or not the subject is
at the clinical site), the Investigator should ask the subject to return for the Follow -up visit
procedures, provided that the subject has not wi thdrawn consent for those procedures. If a
subject refuses to complete early termination procedures and/or the Follow -up visit, this
information will be recorded. The implants should be removed whenever possible from all
subjects who discontinue in the stu dy

8.1. Treatment Administration
Following confirmation of a signed informed consent document, eligibility and entry into the
Conversion Phase or Maintenance Phase:
Conversion Phase -Subjects will be converted from their current antipsychotic to oral
risperidone 4 mg/day over a minimum of 2and a maximum of 6weeks.
Maintenance Phase –approximately 25% of the s ubjects will receive 2 -360mgand
approximately 75% 3-300mgRisperidone Implants atBaseline (Implant Day) and week
24.
Subjects meeting the criteria to enter the Maintenance Phase will receive Risperidone Implants
twice for up to 48weeks of treatment total.
8.1.1. Implant Insertion and Removal Procedures
AllRisperidone implants will be implanted and removed by [CONTACT_44753] . The Sponsor will
institute the Risperidone Implant Clinical and Procedure Training and Evaluation program to
ensure that clinicians who perform the implant insertion and removal procedures meet
competency standards. The Sponsor will also provide an Implant Insertion/Removal Instruction
for Use slide deck and live training on the instructions for asepti c sub dermal insertion and
removal of Risperidone implants. Following each implantation thephysician willcomplete a
User Input Survey toassess theperformance oftheinvestigational Insertion Tool.
Prior to Maintenance Phase, Baseline (Implant Day ), subjects willtake their oral antipsychotic
thatday as prescribed and for one day after . In addition, subjects should discontinue any non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory (NSAID) or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -containing medications one week prior to and
bathe the day of inser tion and removal of implants.
Details on Insertion/Removal procedures and training will be provided in the Instructions for
User (IFU) andlive implant training .Subjects should be monitored closely for AEs and vital
signs for at least [ADDRESS_346876] to ensure the implants can be removed .Implant removal procedures are described in
detail in the IFU. If, upon removal, the Implanting Clinician has difficulty locating the implants,
ultrasound may be used to facilitate their localization.

The Risperidone Implant is a sterile subcutaneous implant composed of 6, 60 mg USP grade
risperidone pellets ([ADDRESS_346878] ant) or 5, 60 mg USP grade risperidone pellets (300 mg
implant) , Tecoflex EG -80A, an aliphatic, polyether -based polyurethane membrane that controls
the rate of risperidone release. The dimensions of the implant are approximately 38 mm long
with an outside diameter of approximately 4 mm.  The release rate of two 360 mg Risperidone
Implants (720 mg total dose) is expected to result in comparable Cminsteady -state trough levels
from a 4 mg/day oral dose of risperidone. The release rate of three 300 mg Risperi done Implants
(900 mg total dose) is expected to result in comparable C avgsteady -state trough levels from a 4
mg/day oral dose of risperidone.
Each implant is individually packaged in a foil -lined, heat -sealed pouch. Pouched implants are
labeled and pack aged into an individual Subject Kit (Box).  All Implant Kits used in the
Maintenance Phase will contain 2 , 360 mg or 3, 300 mg Risperidone Implants. Commercially
available oral risperidone 2 mg and 4 mg will be provided to subjects in the Conversion Phase.
All containers/packages /boxes of study drug will be clearly labeled with study -specific
information meeting all the applicable regulatory/institutional requirements.
8.2.1. Handling, Storage, and Accountability
All study drugs will be transported, received, sto red, and handled strictly in accordance with the
container or product label, the instructions provided to the research site, and applicable
regulations.
All Subject Kits should be stored at room temperature (15–25°C /59–77°F) in a secured area and
in acc ordance with applicable laws, regulations and institutional requirements.
Detailed drug accountability records must be maintained, including the dates shipments are
received, the quantity of material received, the dates dispensed, the running inventory, a nd the
unused quantities returned to the Sponsor ’s drug supply vendor at the end of the trial. All unused
supplies will be checked against the drug accountability records during the study and/or at the
end of the study. Subjects will be instructed to retur n all unused study drugs to the clinical site
(oral risperidone; Conversion Phase).
Following implant removal, appropriate disposal of all implants is outlined in the Study IFU.
8.2.2. Dispensing and Administration
The study drug will be dispensed or administer ed according to applicable standard operating
procedures. Details regarding the preparation and administration of the study drugs will be
outlined in a study -specific procedure. Only eligible subjects participating in the study will
receive the study drug. Only authorize d research site staff may supply or administer the study
drugs. Once dispensed, s tudy drug may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by [CONTACT_23837].

Version: Final 4 .0,15JUL 2016 Page 33of678.3. Selection of Doses
Approximately 25% of the total number of subjects enrolled will have two, 360 mg Risperidone
Implants inserted. The approximate remaining 75% of the total number of subjects enrolled will
have three, 300 mg Risperidone Implants inserted. Two 360 mg Risperidone Implants (720 mg
total dose) will deliver, over 24 weeks, compar able C minplasma levels of oral risperidone 4
mg/day.  Three 300 mg Risperidone Implants (900 mg total dose) will deliver, over 24 weeks,
comparable C avgplasma levels of oral risperidone 4 mg/day. Risperidone 4 mg/day is considered
a therapeutic dose in t he long -term treatment of schizophrenia.  Based on the CATIE study the
average daily dose of risperidone is 3.9 mg per day (Lieberman et al, 2005; Lehman, et al.,
2004).  The study was initiated by [CONTACT_283981], 360 mg (720 mg total dose)
Risperidone Implants with the understanding that the 720 mg Risperidone Implants would
deliver, over 24 weeks, comparable C minplasma levels of oral risperidone 4mg/day.  After
thorough PK modeling, it was later determined, after the study was initiated, that three, 300 mg
(900 mg total dose), over 24 weeks, would deliver approximately Cavgplasma levels of oral
risperidone 4 mg/ day.  The target dose of the Risperidone Implants is to deliver approximate Cavg
plasma levels of oral risperidone 4 mg/day and that dose is three, 300 mg (900 mg total dose).
Oral risperidone 1 mg to 4 mg/day will be administered at the investigator ’sdiscretion in the
Conversion Phase.
8.4. Selection andTiming of Dose
During the Conversion Phase subjects will be tapered off their current antipsychotic and titrated
to oral Risperidone 4 mg/day administered in the morning without regard to meals.  On Baseline
of the Maintenance Phase each subject will have two or three Risperidone Implants inserted in
the upper portion of one arm. Baseline procedures and insertion of the Risperidone Implants
may take place over 24 hours if necessary, but it is prefera ble that all Baseline procedures occur
on the same day as insertion of the Risperidone Implants. Onweek 24/Day 168 (±4 days) of the
Maintenance Phase, the currently inserted Risperidone Implants will be removed and subjects
will receive two or three new R isperidone Implants in the opposite armdepending on what dose
they received originally .
8.5. Blinding
The entire study is open -label so subjects, physicians, andsponsors will know what product the
patients are administered during the course of the study.
8.6. Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All non -study medications, including prescription, over -the-counter, or herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], used by
[CONTACT_283982] 45days prior to Screening and throughout the study. The
Investigator will determine if the prior/concomitant medication(s) affect the patient’s/subject’s
eligibility to participate or continue to participate in the study. Any medication the patient takes
between Screening and the end of the study, other than the study drug, is considered to be a

9.3.1. Primary Endpoint s
1)Safety parameters will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_283984], clinical
laboratory evalu ations, ECGs, physical examinations, implant site assessments, extrapyramidal
symptom assessments (EPS), Columbia Severity Scale assessments (C -SSRS), Abnormal
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson -Angus Scale (SAS), and Barnes Akathisia Scale
(BARS), and adverse event (AE) monitoring.
2)Time to discontinuation due to all causes
3)Mean change from baseline to endpoint in PANSS Total Score
4)Mean change from baseline to endpoint in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S)
5)Mean change from baseline to en dpoint in PANSS positive and negative subscales
6)Mean CGI -I score at endpoint
[IP_ADDRESS]. Positive and Negative Symptom Scale
The PANSS consists of [ADDRESS_346895], severity is rated on a 7 -point scal e, with a score of 1 indicating the absence
of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms. The symptom constructs
for each subscale are as follows:
1)Positive Subscale (7 positive symptom constructs: delusions, conceptual disorganization,
hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_23703]/persecution, and hostility)
2)Negative Subscale (7 negative symptom constructs: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal,
poor rapport, passive /apathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking , lack of
spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking)
3)General Psychopathology Subscale (16 symptom constructs: somatic concern s,anxiety,
guilt feelings, tension, mannerism sand posturing, depression, motor retardation,
uncooperative ness, unusual thought content, disorientation, poor attention, lack of
judgment and insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse control, preoccupation, and
active social avoidance)
All efforts w ill be made to ensure that the same rater adm inistered the PANSS f or a given subject
and the number of ra ters within each trial center i s kept to a minimum. Instructions for
administering this instrument will be provi ded to the site. All raters will be required to
demonstrate interrater reliability before rating su bject s in this trial. A copy of the PANSS
assessment with complete rating criteria isrequired as source documentation. Qualified raters
will be required to demonstrate rating proficiency on the PANSS prior to being certified to rate
subjects in the trial to ensure continued interrater reliability through the duration of the trial.
PANSS is required at the designated times, but can be conducted at any time during the Phase at
the discretion of the Investigator.  If relapse occurs or PI [INVESTIGATOR_283960],
PANSS should be conducted.

9.4. Safety Assessments
Safety monitoring will be performed throughout the study for all subjects.
9.4.1. Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
TheInvestigator and research site staff are responsible for the detection, documentation,
classification, reporting, and follow -up of events meeting the definition of an AE or serious
adverse event (SAE). An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically
significant laboratory abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product.
All AEs will be reco rded in the AE eCRF, regardless of causality or severity ,following informed
consent (at Screening) until the end of the Follow -up period of the study. Pre-existing
conditions, diseases, or disorders are not considered AEs unless there is a change in inte nsity,
frequency, or quality.
Appropriate medical intervention should be provided and, if necessary, implants may be removed
as clinically indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Reporting
All AEs must be entered on the AE CRF, regardless of causality or severity. AEs include new
AEs, worsening baseline conditions, clinically significant laboratory findings, disease -related
signs and symptoms that were not present at baseline, and any events or findings that the
Investigator feels are clinically significant.
Disease -related signs and symptoms that are present at baseline should not be recorded as AEs
unless they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.
Information collected concerning AE s will include the following:
Name [CONTACT_12581]
Onset date
Resolution date
Severity (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe)
Relationship to study drug
Action and outcome
Relationship to insertion / removal procedure
Seriousness of event

days after the End of Treatment Visit (i.e., implant removal ).All unresolved AEs will be
followed for a minimum of 14 days after the participant ’s final study visit, unless the
Investiga tor’s judgment dictates otherwise, the event has resolved or stabilized before the [ADDRESS_346897] been designated as
possibly related to study drug will be followed until resolution or stabilization.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events and Serious Unexpected Adverse Events
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (at the time of the event);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
An Important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical
judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
A serious and unexpected AE is an SAE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in
the risk information set out in the Investigator ’s Brochure/Product Monograph of the drug .

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_346898] is receiving study drug and within
30days following the End of Treatment Visit are rep ortable within 24 hours.
The procedure for reporting an SAE is as follows:
Within [ADDRESS_346899] the Sponsor (or
designee) by [CONTACT_283985].
The initial report should include all info rmation known at the time of the report
(additional information can be reported as discovered). Do not delay the initial reporting
in order to obtain resolution or follow -up information.
The site will enter into the electronic database (or fax, if the data base cannot be accessed
for any reason) an SAE report, or similar form, that includes the following information,
as available:

The Medical Monitor or another representativ e of the Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_283986]. All SAEs will be
entered on the AE eCRF. The same nomenclature should be used on both the SAE report and the
AEeCRF.
Specific in structions for SAE reporting and a copy of an SAE report form will be provided to the
sites.
The Investigator is responsible for the complete and timely reporting of all SAEs to the Sponsor
(or designee), reporting pertinent follow -up information on the SAE, and notifying the
appropriate IRB / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of the occurrence of and details
surrounding the event. In the event there is a question as to whether the AE is serious, the event
should be reported.
9.4.2. Pregnancy
Urine pregnancy te sts could be performed at any point during the trial if pregnancy is suspected.
All positive urine pregnancy test results are confirmed by a 2ndurine pregnancy test. Treated
subjects with 2 positive urine tests will discontinue treatment, be withdrawn fro m the trial, and
an immediately reportable event form will be completed.
Pregnancies among trial participants should be reported to the Sponsor or designee as soon as
possible after learning of the event. Follow -up information will be obtained where possi ble (with
the consent of the participant or their partner) regarding the course and outcome of the
pregnancy, including any post -natal sequelae in the infant ([ADDRESS_346901] -birth).

Version: Final [ADDRESS_346902] them to the clinical site in a
timely manner. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review and sign all lab reports
expeditiously, in order to document appropriate safety monitoring of study subjects. The
Investigator should sign and date each lab report concurrent with her or his re view, and should
indicate the clinical significance of each abnormal/flagged value by [CONTACT_12542] “NCS ”(not clinically
significant) or “CS”(clinically significant), for example. Notations indicating that a value is
clinically significant should also include a brief description of the underlying disease or
condition that is associated with the value, e.g., “CS/mild anemia. ”In general, abnormal,
clinically significant laboratory values are expected to be associated with an item recorded in
medical history or wi th an AE.
Blood and urine samples will be collected, processed, and shipped according to instructions from
the safety laboratory. Additional laboratory samples may be taken at the discretion of the
Investigator if the results of any tests fall outside refe rence ranges or clinical symptoms
necessitate testing to ensure safety. Specific hematology, coagulation, biochemistry, and
urinalysis assessments are listed in Table 4 .

Version: Final 4 .0,15JUL 2016 Page 54of679.4.6. 12-Lead Electrocardiograms
Twelve -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of
Assessments ( Table 1,Table 2,andTable 3).ECGs will be performed after the subject has been
resting in asemi -supi[INVESTIGATOR_221874] r at least 5minutes. The ECG variables will include
ventricular heart rate and the PR, QRS, QT, QTcB and QTcF intervals. The ECGs will be signed
and dated by a medically -qualified individual to confirm review of the ECG and verify whether
any abnormalitie s are clinically significant. In general, abnormal, clinically significant ECGs are
expected to be associated with an item recorded in medical history or with an AE.
Additional 12 -lead ECGs may beobtained at the Investigator ’sdiscretion and arealways to be
obtained in the event of an early termination. The ECGs areevaluated at the investigational site
to determine the subject ’s eligibility and to monitor safety during the trial. The ECG should be
repeated if any results areconsidered to be cl inically relevant.
A screening ECG finding of QTc > 47 0 msec for females and QTc > 450 msec for males using
the QTcF (Fridericia) correction is exclusionary (see exclusion criterion #18in Section 7.2). In
addition, subjects areexcluded if they had any o ther abnormal ECG finding at screening that, in
theInvestigator ’s judgment, aremedically significant in that it would impact the safety of the
subject or the interpretation of the trial results.
9.4.7. Physical Examination
Physical examinations will be perform ed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments ( Table
1,Table 2,andTable 3).  A complete physical examination will be conducted with the exception
of the genitourin ary (GU) body system at Visit 1 (Screeni ng) and the End of Study Visit.
9.4.8. Physical Measurements
Height will be measured at Screening while body weight /BMI will be recorded at Screening , and
at scheduled time points ( Table 1,Table 2, and Table 3) throughout the Conversion and
Maintenance Phases . The following guidelin es will aid in the standardization of these
measurements:
• The same scale should be used to weigh a given patient throughout the study.
• Scales should be calibrated and reliable; scales should be zeroed just prior to each patient’s
weigh -in session.
•Weight should be recorded before a patient’s meal (if applicable) and at approximately the
same time each day.
• A patient should be minimally clothed (i .e., no shoes or heavy over garments).
The BMI (kg/m2)will be calculated from the screening height and the weight at the current visit
using one of the following formulae, as appropriate: Weight (kg) ÷ [Height (m)]2orWeight (lb)
÷ [Height (in)]2x 703.

reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_25733]’s IRB, prior to providing them to subjects.
Implant site assessments will include monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection, (e.g., pain,
tenderness, swelling, erythema, exudate) and tolerability. The presence of the implant will be
assessed by [CONTACT_283987] ( Table 2,Table 3). Clinically significant infection , asdeemed by [CONTACT_33316], resulting from the implant site assessment will be recorded as AEs. If there is
scarring, abnormal bleeding, infection etc., atthe implant location, non -identifying pi[INVESTIGATOR_283963]. If an infection devel ops at the implant site, the subject will be
withdrawn from the study and the implant will be removed. The infection will be treated in
accordance with standard medical practice. Once the implant has been removed the subject will
be restarted on his/her pr e-implant regimen.  Additionally, ultrasounds may be performed at the
discretion of the Investigator to confirm implant location.
If there is any evidence of removal or attempted removal of the implants, or if the subject
confirms the removal of some or a ll of the implants, the subject will be withdrawn from study
and any remaining implant will be removed.
If an expulsion of an implant(s) occurs, and the subject appears to be compliant and wants to
continue with the study, the current implant site will hav e all implants removed and new
implants (same dosage strength as original) will be implanted into the opposite arm. If an
expulsion occurs, sites are to contact [CONTACT_283988].
The Investigator will inform the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor of any clinically significant findings
related to implant assessments.
9.4.10. Other Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS )
Suicidality will be monitored thro ughout the trial using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating
Scale (C-SSRS ). The C -SSRS scale consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime
experience of the subject with suicide events and suici dal ideation and a post baseline ”Since
Last Visit”evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last trial visit. The baseline C-SSRS
form will be completed at Screening . The “Since Last Visit ”C-SSRS form w ill be completed at
all subsequent visits.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Simpson -Angus Scale (SAS)
The SAS consists of a list of 10 symptoms of parkinsonism (gait, arm droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], shoulder
shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, head rotation, glabella tap, tremor, salivati on, and
akathisia). Each item i s rated on a 5 -point scale, with a score of one representing absence of
Clinical Trial Protocol Braeburn Pharmaceuticals
BB-RSP-301 CONFIDENTIAL
Version: Final 4 .0,15JUL 2016 Page 56of67symptoms, and a score of 5 representing a severe condition. The SAS Total Score is the sum of
the scores for all 10 items.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)
The AIMS assessment consists of 10 items describing symptoms of dyskinesia. Facial and ora l
movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk movements
(item 7) are observed unobtrusively while the subject is at rest (e.g., in the waiting room), and
theInvestigator also makes global judgments on the subject’s dyskin esias (items 8 through 10).
Each item is rated on a 5 -point scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of symptoms (for
item 10, no awareness), and a score of 4 indicating a severe condition (for item 10,
awareness/severe distress). For this scale, the subject is to be sitting on a hard, firm chair. In
addition, the AIMS includes 2 yes/no questions that addresses the subject’s dental status. The
AIMS Movement Rating Score is defined as the sum of items 1 through 7 (i.e., items 1 through
4, facial and ora l movements; items 5 through 6, extremity movements; and item 7, trunk
movements).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)
The BARS consists of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia by [CONTACT_33316], subjective feelings of restlessness by [CONTACT_423], subject distress due to akathisia,
and global evaluation of akathisia. The first 3 items a re rated on a 4 -point scale, with a score of 0
representing absence of symptoms and a score of 3 representing a severe condition. The glo bal
clinical evaluation ismade on a 6 -point scale, with 0 representing absence of symptoms and a
score of 5 representing severe akathisia. To complete this scale, subjects areobserved while they
were seated and then standing for a minimum of 2 minutes in each position. Symptoms observed
inother situations (e .g., while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity on the
ward) are also rated. Subjective phenomena areto be elicited by [CONTACT_81257].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI)
ThePi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) is a self -rated questionnaire which assesses sleep
quality and disturbances over a 1 -month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven
“component” scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep dur ation, habitual sleep
efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_88794], and daytime dysfunction. The sum of
scores for these seven components yields one global score .(Buysse et al., 1989)

their first assessment. This identifier will be cross -referenced in the participant ’s chart. The
identifier will not contain any potentially identifiable information. An identifier log will be
maintained, linking each participant ’s name [CONTACT_12582]. This log will be
stored at the research site in a secure location.
The knowledge gained through this study is the property of the sponsor. The sponsor,
representatives and affiliated companies of the sponsor, the IRB, and regulatory agencies (such
as the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration [F DA]) may inspect medical records related

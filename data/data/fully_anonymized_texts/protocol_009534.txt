 5.0 Protocol Synopsis  
Title:  A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized,  Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) vs. Placebo in Subjects with 
Acute Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  
Primary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp  versus placebo in sub jects with acute 
vulvovaginal candidiasis (AVVC) by [CONTACT_742701]:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp  versus placebo in subjects with AVVC based 
on mycological and clinical out comes  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral ibrexafungerp  versus placebo in subjects with 
AVVC  
Primary Endpoints:  
• Efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_27370] (complete resolution 
of signs and symptoms) at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit  
Secondary Endpoints:  
Efficacy as measured by:  
• The percentage of subjects with mycological eradication ( negative culture for growth of 
Candida  species) at the TOC visit  
• The percentage of subjects with clinical cure and mycological e radication (responder 
outcome) at the TOC visit.  
• The percentage of subjects with complete resolution of symptoms at the Follow -up (FU) 
visit.  
• The percentage of subjects with clinical improvement (partial or complete resolution of signs 
and symptoms with to tal composite score no greater than 1) at the TOC visit.  
• The absolute change in signs and symptoms score from Baseline to TOC and FU visits.  
 
Safety and tolerability as measured by:  
• Adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examination, treatment discontinuation and 
safety laboratory tests . 
Study Phase:  3 
Study Design:  This is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) compared to placebo 
in female subjects 12 years and older with AVVC.  Approximately 366 eligible subjects will be 
enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either ibrexafungerp (300-mg dose twice a day [BID]) 
or matching placebo administered BID for 1 day.  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015219] of a Screening visit, a Baseline visit on Day  1 (these visits may occur on 
the same day), a TOC visit on Day 11 (±3) and a FU visit on Day 25 (±4).  
Screening  
At Screening, subjects who are experiencing vulvovaginal sym ptoms will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1275], who will obtain a vaginal sample for potassium hydroxide (KOH) testing and 
vaginal pH determination by [CONTACT_742702]. The vaginal samples will also be ev aluated locally for findings indicative of bacterial 
vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis.  A vaginal sample for fungal culture and for species 
identification and susceptibility testing will be obtained and sent to a designated central 
laboratory. If the inv estigator suspects Herpes  virus, Neisseria  gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia 
trachomatis infection, a vaginal sample will be collected and sent to a designated central 
laboratory . The investigators and the subjects will rate the signs and symptoms of infection, 
respectively, on a standardized vulvovaginal signs and symptoms scale (the Vulvovaginal Signs 
and Symptoms [VSS] Scale). Safety procedures, including an abbreviated physical exam, vital 
signs, laboratory tests and a pregnancy test will also be performed.  
To be eligible for inclusion, subjects must have a minimum composite score of vulvovaginal 
signs and symptoms ≥[ADDRESS_1015220] 2 signs or symptoms having a score of 2 (moderate) or 
greater in the VSS Scale at Baseline , a positive KOH test and a normal vaginal  pH (≤4.5).  
The Screening and Baseline (Day 1) visits may occur on the same day.  
Baseline  
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment groups:  
• Oral ibrexafungerp 300-mg dose BID for 1 day  
• Oral ibrexafungerp matching placebo BID for [ADDRESS_1015221] dosing details, AEs and concomitant medication use from 
Day 1 until the TOC visit (Day 8-Day 14). Subjects will self -administer their second study drug 
dose at home [ADDRESS_1015222] dose.  
Assessment of Clinical Cure (TOC)  
At the TOC visit (Day 8-Day 14), subjects will return any remaining medication as well as empty 
bottles of the study drug and treatment compliance will be evaluated. Subject dia ries will be 
returned and reviewed. The investigators and the subjects will rate the signs and symptoms of 
infection, respectively, on the VSS Scale. A vaginal sample for fungal culture and for species 
identification and antifungal susceptibility testing w ill be obtained and sent to a designated 
central laboratory. An abbreviated physical exam, vital signs measurements and safety laboratory 
tests will also be performed.  
If the baseline vulvovaginal symptoms have not noticeably improved or have worsened and the 
investigator considers that rescue antifungal medication may be needed, a vaginal sample should 
also be obtained for KOH testing by [CONTACT_12082].  
Follow up  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015223]´s signs of infection.  
All Visits  
AEs and prior/concomitant medications will be assessed and documented at all visits.  
Efficacy (Clinical and Mycological) and Safety Assessments  
Clinical Evaluation  
The signs (edema, erythema and excoriation or fissures) and symptoms (burning, itching and 
irritation) of infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_27379], respectively, on the 
VSS Scale [provided in Appendix B of the protocol ]). The VSS Scale is a standardized, 
predefined scale where each sign and symptom will be given a numerical rating based on severity 
(absent = 0; mild  = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3) to calculate a total composite score.  
Mycological  Testing  
Mycological tests will include direct microscopic examination with 10% KOH and fungal 
cultures. KOH will be performed locally at Screening for the determination of subject eligibility 
and at the TOC visit or FU visit if symptoms  persist or recur. Vaginal samples will be collected  
at Screening, TOC visit and prior to the initiation of rescue antifungal medication during the 
study  for fungal cultures and tested  centrally. The central lab will determine growth of yeasts, 
species identification and susceptibility testing.  
Safety Assessments  
Safety procedures will include collection of AEs, treatment discontinuations, physical 
examination, vital signs, safety lab oratory tests and prior and concomitant medications.  
Early Termination  
If the subject experiences persistence or worsening or recurrence of symptoms that per the 
investigator’s assessment (e.g., symptoms ≥3) warrant the use of rescue antifungal therapy, a 
vaginal examination with investigator’s rating of signs should be compl eted. Additionally, 
vulvovaginal samples should be obtained for KOH testing and pH measurements by [CONTACT_27396], fungal culture by [CONTACT_742703]. If the KOH test is 
negative, the investigator should consider other causes for the persistence or worsening of the 
symptoms and antifungal rescue medication may not be indicated.  
If the investigator’s rating of the vulvovaginal signs and vaginal sample collection is not possible 
prior to the initiation of the rescue therapy, it should still be completed as soon as possible after 
rescue therapy is initiated.  
In addition to the vaginal examination, the symptoms that led to the use of res cue antifungal 
therapy should be documented in the eCRF and the following procedures should also be 
completed:  
• If rescue therapy is administered prior to or at the TOC visit, all TOC visit procedures should 
be completed and no additional visits will be nee ded.  The subject will be considered as 
early termination due to lack of efficacy prior to or at TOC.  

SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015224] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 17 
 • If rescue therapy is administered after the TOC visit but prior to or at the FU visit, all FU 
visit procedures should be completed and no additional visit s will be needed.  The subject 
will be considered as early termination due to lack of efficacy after TOC but prior to or 
at FU. 
Oral fluconazole [one 150 -mg dose] may be provided to study sites as rescue medication. 
However, at the investigator’s discretio n other approved antifungal agent s may be administered 
as rescue medication to a particular patient for whom fluconazole is not considered the optimal 
option.  All rescue antifungal medication s should be documented in the eCRF.

• Oral ibrexafungerp matching placebo BID for 1 day  

SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015230] dose.  
Study Blinding, Randomization  and Stratification : This is a randomized, double -blind study. 
All site and sponsor personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
Approximately 366 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the 
two study treatment groups. For the purpose of main taining treatment blinding, all subjects 
randomized to the placebo group will receive matching ibrexafungerp placebo tablets. All 
randomization of subjects will be managed electronically through an interactive response system 
(voice or web-based).  
Eligible subjects will be stratified at randomization based on the presence or absence of a 
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (diabetes mellitus: YES or NO).  
Study Evaluations:  
Efficacy Evaluations:  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with clinical cure 
(complete resolution of signs and symptoms) at the TOC visit. Secondary efficacy endpoints 
include the percentage of subjects with mycological eradication (negative  culture for growth of 
Candida  species) at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with clinical cure and mycological 
eradication at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with complete resolution of symptoms at 
the FU visit, and the percentage of sub jects with clinical improvement (partial or complete 
resolution of signs and symptoms with a total composite score no greater than 1) at the TOC 
visit.  
The following treatment outcome definitions will be used for the assessment of efficacy:  
Clinical Outco me 
• Clinical cure:  Complete resolution of signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal infection without 
need for further antifungal treatment. Specifically, for complete resolution,  any sign or 
symptom should be absent (score = 0) by [CONTACT_477743].  
• Clinical failure:  No response to therapy or incomplete resolution of signs and symptoms or 
need for additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal therapy. If the subject receives or 
self-administers topi[INVESTIGATOR_606497]/pruritu s 
such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_742686], the subject is considered a clinical failure.  
Mycological Outcome  
• Mycological eradication:  A subject with negative culture for Candida species.  
• Mycological persistence:  A subject with a positive culture for Candida  species.  
Safety Evaluations:  
Safety will be evaluated throughout the study, including the following parameters: AEs, 
treatment disc ontinuations, physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, and prior 
and concomitant medications.  
AEs will be recorded and reviewed at all scheduled and unscheduled study visits from the time 
the Informed Consent Form is signed. An abbreviat ed physical examination, including general 
appearance and an overall examination of body systems, will be conducted at Screening and at 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015231] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 20 
 the TOC visit. Vital signs, including blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_742687], and at unscheduled 
visits, if needed. Safety laboratory tests (hematology and blood chemistry) will be measured at 
Screening, at the TOC visit and at unscheduled visits, if needed. All prior and co ncomitant 
medications taken before Baseline (Day 1) through the TOC visit will be recorded. Only the use 
of antifungal medications, vaginal (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) medications, antibiotics for any reason or any other 
medications to treat an AE will be recorded after the  TOC visit through the last study visit (FU).  
Statistical Analyses:  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later, unless otherwise 
stated.  All statistical tests will be two -sided and interpreted at a 5% significance level.   
Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, etc.) will be 
provided for all continuous variables; frequencies and percentages will be presented for 
incidence and categorical variables.  For parameters measured over ti me, observed values and 
changes from Baseline will be described for each time point.  
The clinical cure and mycological eradication rates will be described by [CONTACT_742704], when the number of isolates per species allows.  
All analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] .  Unless otherwise stated, d ata will be analyzed 
as is with no imputation.  No adjustment for multiplicity will be employed.  
A Statistical Analysis  Plan (SAP) describing all statistical analyses in detail will be provided as 
a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments.  
Sample Size Determination  
The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subje cts achieving a clinical cure at the 
TOC visit. Assuming clinical cure rates of 50% and 30% for ibrexafungerp  and placebo 
administered in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, approximately 282 subjects will provide 90% power to 
detect a difference between ibrexafung erp and placebo based on a Pe arson’s Chi-square d test 
with a Type 1 error rate of 5%. Because it is expected that approximately 20% of subjects may 
not have a mycological culture -confirmed infection at Baseline and approximately 10% may 
withdraw early from  the study, an additional 84 subjects are added for a total of 366 subjects 
(244 subjects randomized to ibrexafungerp and 122 subjects, to placebo).  
Analysis Populations  
The study populations to be used in the analyses are defined as follows:  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:  All randomized subjects.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population:  All randomized subjects who have a positive 
culture for Candida  species at Baseline.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population:  All mITT subjects who have completed the study drug  treatment 
AND who have a TOC evaluation.  
Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and 
who have at least one post -Baseline evaluation.  
Efficacy Analyses : 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015232] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 21 
 The efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT (primary analysis population), ITT and 
PP populations to eva luate SCY -078 vs. placebo.  
The primary endpoint, percentage of subjects with clinical cure at TOC, will be analyzed using 
a Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for site; the p -value and 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented. Missing Day 8-Day 14 (TOC) data for the primary endpoint will be 
imputed as failures in the analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be performed where subjects with 
missing values will be removed from the analysis. All other d ata will be analyzed as is with no 
imputation.  
For other continuous efficacy endpoints, a two -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model will 
be used including effects for treatment and site; p-values and 95% confidence intervals will be

 7.0 Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
7.1 Background Information  
Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common fungal infection caused by [CONTACT_742705]. and is a 
significant morbidity condition in women from all social classes . 
Information on the i ncidence of VVC  is incomplete, since the disease is not a reportable entity an d 
data collection is hampered by [CONTACT_27384] -representative study 
populations.1 VVC affects 70 %–75% of women at least once during their lives, most frequently 
young women of childbearing age . Approximately 40%–50% of women will experience a 
recurrence2 and 5 % to 8 % of adult women have a recurrent vulvovaginal ca ndidiasis.3  
Current treatments for VVC include topi[INVESTIGATOR_606499] a single doses of fluconazole.  In two vaginal c andidiasis studies conducted with fluconazole, 
the therapeutic cure rate, defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms of vaginal candidiasis 
along with negative KOH examination and negative culture for Candida , was achieved by 55% of 
subjects receiving  single dose s of fluconazole 150  mg.  The therapeutic cure rate is reduced to 
40% in subjects with a history of recurrent vaginitis4,5. Although a single dose of fluconazole is 
able to  provide an acceptable therapeutic outcome for more than half of the treated individuals, the 
emergence of fluconazole resistance among C. albicans  isolates and the frequency of cases caused 
by C. glabrata,  a strain naturally less susceptible to fluconazol e, signals the need for new 
therapeutic approaches.  
Additionally, recurrence of VVC after fluconazole therapy is not uncommon and these 
exacerbations often involve the same microorganism identified in the initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], suggesting 
that a small number of  C. albicans  remain as a reservoir in the vagina after completion of azole 
therapy, becoming the source of subsequent exacerbations. This may be explained by [CONTACT_742706], which means that they slow the growth of, but do not kill, t he fungus and 
azoles are not active against certain species of Candida  that cause VVC.  
New curative approaches are needed, particularly involving agents with fungicidal activity ( i.e., 
that are able to kill the fungus) and activity agains t fluconazole -resistant strains, so that the 
causative yeasts can be eradicated . A new therapeutic approach with these characteristics would 
be expected to result in improved short -term and potentially long -term outcomes for this condition.   
This study aims to provide evid ence of the efficacy and evaluate the safety of oral SCY -[ADDRESS_1015235] Candida  spp. in the treatment of 
patients with VVC.  
The glucan synthesis inhibitor ibrexafungerp (formerly known as SCY -078) 
Ibrexafungerp  (formerly known as SCY -078) is a member of a new class of antifungal agents and 
is an orally active, semi -synthetic, triterpen oid derivative of the natural product enfumafungin. 
Ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) is a structurally d istinct class of gluc an synthesis  inhibitor (GSI) that 
inhibits the synthesis of the fungal cell wall  polymer β -(1,3) -D-glucan.  Time -kill studies have 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015236] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 24 
 demonstrated that ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) has in vitro fungicidal activity against Candida  spp. 
isolates similar to that obser ved with the echinocandins.  
Ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) is being developed as the first oral and intravenous (IV) GSI for the 
treatment and prevention of fungal infections caused by [CONTACT_742707].  
Antifungal activity  
The spectrum and potency of activity of ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) has been evaluated by [CONTACT_742708] i solates 
using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( M27 -A3 guidelines)[ADDRESS_1015237] demonstrated that ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) has potent, broad -spectrum activity against the 
majority of the clinical isolates tested. These studies have laid the foundation in support of the use 
of ibrexafungerp  SCY -[ADDRESS_1015238] Candida spp. 
Ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) has been evaluated against > [ADDRESS_1015239] spectrum of 
anti-Candida activity of SCY -078. Additionally, ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) demonstrated in vitro 
activity against pre -formed biofilms, which is a relevant feature when addressing catheter -related 
Candida infections  and, potentially,  VVC . Studies conducted with azole - and echinocandin -
resistant strains have shown that ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) retains activity (i.e., no significant 
change in minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] compared to wild type) against >90% of azole -
resistant strains and >70% of Candida strains with FKS mutations commonly associated with 
echinocandin resistance. Interest ingly, although ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) and the echinocandins 
share a similar mechanism of action (β -[1,3] -D-glucan synthesis inhibition), their clearly different 
molecular structure provides them with some differentiating characteristics in terms of 
micro biological activity.  
Ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) was evaluated in vitro against clinical isolates of echinocandin -resistant 
strains of Candida spp. containing  mutations in the FKS gene. Overall, ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) 
was active against the majority of the e chinocandin -resistant strains tested. Significantly, 
ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) was active against approximately 70% of the isolates containing the 
most commonly reported FKS mutation associated with echinocandin resistance in C. glabrata 
(S663P in FKS2  and S 645P in FKS1 ). Selection of ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) resistance in vitro 
occurs at a low frequency. A deletion at position F659 in FKS2  of C. glabrata was the predominant 
mutation observed in these studies; notably, ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) did not select fo r mutations 
at positions S663 or S645. These results suggest that ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) inhibits glucan 
synthase in a manner different from that of echinocandins.  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015240] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 25 
 The in vitro studies also included several multidrug -resistant isolates. Consistent with t he data 
described above, ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) was active against >70% of these isolates. 
ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) has also demonstrated a potent activity against life -threatening and 
multi -drug-resistant C. auris strains over [ADDRESS_1015241].  C. auris  has been recently highlighted a s a clinical 
alert by [CONTACT_7698] ( CDC ) because of the global emergence 
of this fungal infection with limited therapeutic options and high mortality.  
Activity against Aspergillus spp. 
The in vitro activity of ibrexafunge rp (SCY -078) has been evaluated against > [ADDRESS_1015242] clinically relevant species and azole -resistant strains. The 
results demonstrated potent activity of ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) against all of the strains tested.  
Murine models of invasive fungal infections  
The antifungal efficacy of ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) has been evaluated in several murine models 
of disseminated candidiasis and aspergillosis. In a disseminated C. albicans model, ibrexafungerp 
(SCY -078) was more  active than fluconazole at all doses. Murine models of SCY -078 in 
disseminated candidiasis caused by C. glabrata and C. tropi[INVESTIGATOR_742688]. The ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) area under the concentration -time curve  (AUC ) 
in plasma necessary to achieve target efficacy in these models was estimated to be 15.4 ± 2.2 
μM•hr.  
Nonclinical experience  
Toxicology studies in rats and dogs have been conducted with ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) following 
oral administration for up to [ADDRESS_1015243] also 
been completed. The results from the non -clinical safety program provide adequate safety support 
for the doses and treatment duration intended in thi s study.  
The in vitro studies indicated that ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) metabolism was predominantly 
oxidative, with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A being the primary enzyme involved in its oxidative 
metabolism. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A would be expected to increa se plasma levels of 
ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078); therefore, the concurrent administration of ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) 
with such inhibitors is prohibited .  
Clinical experience  
To date, over [ADDRESS_1015244] received either oral or IV formulations  of 
ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.  
Ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) was generally well tolerated following single oral doses of up to 1600 
mg and multiple oral doses of up to 800 mg/day for 28 consecutive days in Phase 1 studies. 
Reported a dverse events (AEs) after oral administration have been generally transient and 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015245] been mild 
gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain).  
A Phase 2 stu dy of oral ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) as step -down therapy from IV echinocandin in 
patients with invasive candidiasis has been completed. Following three to ten days of IV 
echinocandin therapy, 21 patients received either ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) or fluconazol e. 
Ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) was well tolerated, with an AE profile typi[INVESTIGATOR_742689] ( SOC ). The results from this study also indicated that the 
higher dose of ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) tested (750  mg once daily  [QD]) is predicted to achieve 
the target exposure at steady state in the majority of patients.  
A Phase 2 proof -of-concept study (SCY -078-203) of oral ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) in patients 
with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis ( AVVC) has also been completed. In this multicenter, 
randomized, active -controlled, evaluator -blinded study of oral ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 
compared to oral fluconazole in adult female patients with AVVC, 96 patients with an acute, 
moderate to severe, symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_742690] a 1:1:1 
ratio to receive either oral ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 750 mg with a 1250  mg loading dose for three 
days, oral ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) 750 mg with a 1250  mg loading dose for five days or a single 
dose of oral fluconazole. Ibrexafungerp ( SCY -078) was well tolerated, with the most common AEs 
being mild gastrointestinal events. The high clinical cure rates observed in this study are supportive 
of the clinically relevant antifungal activity of SCY -078 in this form of Candida infection.  
A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Double -Dummy, Active -Controlled, Dose -
Finding Study to Compare the Safety and Efficacy of Oral SCY -078 (ibrexafungerp)  vs. Oral 
Fluconazole in Subjects with Acute Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (DOVE)  
The primary objective of the study was dose selection for our Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_742691]. 
This Phase 2b study was a randomized, multi -center, double -blind, active -controlled, dose -finding 
study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability an d pharmacokinetics of five dose 
regimens of oral ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) in patients with moderate -to-severe acute VVC 
(defined as signs and symptoms score of 7 or greater), with oral fluconazole (FLU) as a reference 
arm. The study enrolled a total of [ADDRESS_1015246] of Cure (TOC) visit without the need of additional antifungal thera py. 
Secondary endpoints included mycological eradication and composite endpoint including both 
clinical cure and my cological eradication. In this P hase 2 study , response was also evaluated as 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015247] combination of attributes for this indication is the 
ibrexafungerp (SCY -078) 600-mg dose administered as 300 mg BID for 2 doses.  
At Day 10 , the TOC visit, the 600 -mg dose showed clinical and myco logical response rates in -line 
with the reference fluconazole arm.  Specifically, the clinical cure was reported in 14 of 27 of 
patients (52%) in the 600 -mg dose and in 14 of 24 of patients (58%) in the fluconazole arm.  The 
percent age of patients showing 0 or 1 signs and symptoms score was also comparable , with 70% 
and 71% of patients reporting this improvement in the ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 600-mg dose and 
fluconazole arms, respectively. The mycological eradication at this timepoint was 63% for both 
groups.  
At Day 25, the follow -up (FU) visit, the ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 600-mg dose showed a trend 
towards improved clinical and mycological outcomes when compared to the fluconazole arm.  If 
patients had persistence or recurrence of  signs and symptoms of  VVC, rescue antifungal 
medication could be prescribed. Seven (7) patients treated with fluconazole received rescue 
antifungal medication, whereas one patient treated with ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 600 mg received 
rescue antifungal medication. The rate of pa tients with zero signs and symptoms at the FU visit 
was 70% for the ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 600-mg dose versus 50% for the fluconazole arm. A 
similar difference was observed with the “ 0 or 1 signs and symptoms  score” analysis, with 8 2% of 
patients achievin g this improvement with the ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 600-mg dose versus 58% 
with fluconazole. The mycological eradication at this timepoint was also numerically higher in the 
600-mg dose (48%) when compared to the f luconazole arm (38%).  
Oral ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 600-mg dose was generally well tolerated, with self -limiting 
(generally one -day duration), mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) being the 
most commonly reported. Nausea was reported in three patients (10%) in the ibrexafungerp  (SCY -
078) 600-mg dose arm compared to two  patients  (6%) in the FLU arm. Diarrhea and loose stool 
was reported in five patients (17%) in the ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 600-mg dose arm compared 
to one patient in the FLU arm (3%). Abdominal pain was  reported in one patient (3%) in the 
ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) 600-mg dose arm compared to 5 patients (16%) in the FLU arm. No 
vomiting, severe AEs or discontinuations due to AEs were reported in the ibrexafungerp  (SCY -
078) 600-mg dose arm.  
Several drug -drug interaction studies have been conducted. Ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of 
CYP3A) induces a significant (5 -fold) increase in ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) exposure, while 
diltiazem (a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A) induces a mild to moderate (<3 -fold) increase in 
ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) exposure. Ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) did not have a clinically 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015248] on rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) exposure, had only a mild effect (less 
than a 0.5 -fold increase) on the AUC of tacrolimus (a CYP3A and P-glycoprotein [ P-gp] substrate) 
and had no effect on the maximum concentration (C max) of tacrolimus.  
Ibrexa fungerp (SCY -078) has the potential to be an important addition to the antifungal treatment 
arsenal by [CONTACT_742709], including 
difficult -to-treat organisms, and by [CONTACT_742710].

7.2 Rationale for the Study  
This study is being performed to evaluate the efficacy  and safety of one dosing regimen  of 
ibrexafungerp  as compared to placebo  in female  patients  12 years and older  with acute 
vulvovaginal candidiasis ( AVVC ). The study design generally follows the FDA guidance 
regarding drug development for v ulvovaginal c andidiasis7 . 
Rationale for Study Indication and Population  
Considering the properties of ibrexafungerp  as a potent antifungal compound, with fungicidal 
activity  against Candida  spp., it will represent an important non -azole alternative treatment for 
subjects suffering from AVVC.  
Subject s with AVVC are intended for this study  to facilitate  the identification of a clinically 
meaningful effect of ibrexafungerp  in the intended population .   
Rationale for Selected Dose Levels and Dosing Regimens  
The ibrexafungerp  selected dose of 300 mg BID for 1 day  showed meaningful  clinical and 
mycological response rates in a Phase 2b study (DOVE) with adequate tolerability. This dose is  in 
the range of doses that have been well tolerated in Phase 1 investigations . 
Rationale for Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoint for the study is clinical cure (complete resolution of signs and symptoms) 
of the acute symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_742692] 8-Day 14 , which is in line with the FDA 
guidance  on vulvovaginal candidiasis7. The secondary efficacy endpoints will include mycological 
eradication (negative culture  for growth of Candida  spp.) at the TOC  visit, a composite endpoint 
of both clinical cure and mycological eradication  at the TOC visit, complete resolution of 
symptoms at the Follow -up (FU) visit  on Day 2 5 (±4), which are also  in line with current 
guidelines. Additional endpoints  are evaluated, including  clinical improvement (partial or 
complete resolution of signs and symptoms  with total composite score no greater than 1) at  the 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015250] s with AVVC .

10.0 Study Design  
10.1 Overall Description of the Study  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy an d safety of oral ibrexafungerp  compared to placebo in female subjects 1 2 years and 
older with AVVC.  
Approximately 366 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either 
ibrexafungerp  (300-mg dose twice a day  [BID]) or matching placebo administered BID for [ADDRESS_1015252] of a Screening visit, a Baseline visit on Day  1 (these visits may occur on the 
same day), a TOC visit on Day 11 (±3) and a FU visit on Day 25 (±4).  
Efficacy and safety assessments will be conducted for the study. Efficacy will be determined 
primarily by [CONTACT_27370] (complete resolution of signs and 
symptoms) at the TOC visit. Efficacy will also be assessed by [CONTACT_742712] (negative culture  for growth of Candida  species ) at the TOC visit, the 
percentage of subjects with  both clinical cure and mycological eradication at the TOC visit, the 
percentage of subjects with complete re solution of symptoms at the FU visit  and the percentage of 
subjects with clinical improvement (partial or complete  resolution of signs and symptoms with 
total composite score no greater than 1) at the TOC visit . Safety and tolerability will be evaluated 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015253] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 31 
 throughout the study, including the following parameters: AEs, vital signs, an abbreviated physical 
examination, treatment discontinuations and safety laboratory tests.  
A summary description of the study visits a nd assessments is provided below. A schematic of the 
study desi gn is available in Section 6.0. Detailed description s of study treatments and procedures  
are provide d in Section  12.0 and Section 14.0, respectively .  
10.1.1  Study Visits  
Screening (Day -1 [Day -2]) 
At Screening, subjects who are experiencing vulvovaginal symptoms will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1275], who will obtain a vaginal sam ple for potassium hydroxide (KOH) testing and vaginal 
pH determination by [CONTACT_27392]. The 
vaginal samples will also be evaluated locally for findings indicative of bacterial vaginosis and 
Trichom onas vaginalis.  A vaginal sample for fungal culture and for species identification and 
susceptibility testing will be obtained and sent to a designated central laboratory. If the investigator 
suspects Herpes  virus, Neisseria  gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis infection, a vaginal 
sample will be collected and sent to a designated central laboratory . The investigators and the 
subjects will rate the signs and symptoms of infection, respectively, on a standardized vulv ovaginal 
signs and symptoms scale (the Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms [VSS] Scale). Safety 
procedures, including an abbreviated physical exam, vital signs, laboratory tests and a pregnancy 
test will also be performed.  
To be eligible for inclusion, subjec ts must have a minimum composite score of vulvovaginal signs 
and symptoms ≥[ADDRESS_1015254] 2 signs or symptoms having a score of 2 (moderate) or greater in 
the VSS Scale at Baseline , a positive KOH test and a normal vaginal pH (≤4.5).  
The Screening and Baseline (Day 1) visits may occur on the same day.  
 
Baseline (Day 1)  
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment groups:  
• Oral ibrexafungerp  300-mg dose BID for 1 day  
• Oral ibrexafungerp  matching p lacebo BID for [ADDRESS_1015255] dosing details, AEs and concomitant medication use  from 
Day 1 until the TOC visit (Day 8-Day 14) . The second study drug dose will be self -administered 
by [CONTACT_742713] 12 hours later at home on Baseline (Day 1). If administering the 

SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015256] dose at the study center would complicate the administration of the second dose 12 hours later 
(e.g. first dose at 3 p.m. will require second dose at 3 a.m.), the su bject can self -administer both 
doses at home to allow for a more convenient dosing schedule (e.g., 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.). Subjects 
will record study drug dosing details in their study diary.  
 
Assessment of Clinical Cure (TOC [Day 11 ±3 ])  
At the TOC visit (Day 8-Day 14 ), subjects will return any remaining medication as well as empty 
bottles of the study drug  and treatment compliance will be evaluated . Subject diaries will be 
returned and review ed. The investigators and the subjects will rate the signs and symptoms of 
infection, respectively, on the VSS Scale. A vaginal sample for fungal culture and for species 
identification and antifungal susceptibility testing will be obtained and sent to a de signated central 
laboratory.  An abbreviated physical exam , vital signs measurements  and safety laboratory tests 
will also be performed.   
If the baseline vulvovaginal symptoms have not noticeably improved or have worsened and the 
investigator considers that rescue antifungal medication may be needed, a vaginal sample should 
also be obtained for KOH testing by [CONTACT_12082].  
 
Follow up (Day 25 [±4])  
At the FU visit, subjects will rate the ir symptoms of infection on the VSS Scale. Vulvovaginal 
samples for KOH testing and fungal culture should be obtained if there is persistence or recurrence 
of vulvovaginal symptoms. Only if symptoms are present, the investigator will perform a 
vulvovaginal examination to rate the subject´s signs of infection.  
 
All Visi ts 
AEs and prior/concomitant medications will be assessed and documented at all visits.  
10.1.2  Study Assessments  
The study will include efficacy , safety  and tolerability assessments . 
 
Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with clinical cure 
(complete resolution of signs and symptoms) at the TOC visit. Secondary efficacy endpoints 
include the percentage of subjects with mycological eradication (negative culture for growth of  
Candida  species) at the TOC  visit, the percentage of subjects with clinical cure and mycological 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015257] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 33 
 eradication at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with complete resolution of symptoms at 
the FU visit, and the percentage of subjects with clinical improvement (partial or comple te 
resolution of signs and symptoms with a total composite score no greater than 1) at the TOC visit  
and the absolute change in signs and symptoms score from Baseline to TOC and FU visits. .  
Clinical Evaluation  
The signs (edema, erythema and excoriation or fissures) and symptoms ( burning, itching and 
irritation) of infection will be assessed by [CONTACT_27379], respectively, on the VSS 
Scale [provided in Appendix B ]). The VSS Scale is a standar dized, predefined scale where each 
sign and symptom will be given a numerical rating based on severity (absent = 0; mild  = 1; 
moderate = 2; severe = 3) to calculate a total composite score.  
 
Mycological Testing  
Mycological tests will include direct microsc opic examination with 10% KOH and fungal cultures. 
KOH will be performed locally at Screening for the determination of subject eligibility and at the 
TOC  visit or FU visit if symptoms  persist or recur.  Vaginal samples will be collected  at Screening, 
TOC visit and when possible vaginal samples will also be collected prior to the initiation of rescue 
antifungal medication during the stud y for central lab  fungal cultures . The central  lab will culture 
samples for the presences of  yeast,  and process isolates for species identification and susceptibility 
testing.  
 
Safety Assessments   
Safety procedures will include collection of AEs, treatment discontinuations, physical 
examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests and prior and concomitant  medications.  
10.2 Blinding , Randomization and Stratification  
This is a randomized, double -blind study. All site and sponsor personnel will be blinded to 
treatment assignment .  
Approximately 366 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio  to one of the

14. Subject is unlikely to comply with p rotocol requirements.  
11.[ADDRESS_1015269] may be discontinued from the study  or study  drug for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of consent  by [CONTACT_3184]/or parent or legal representative ; 
• Investigator or sponsor decision that withdrawal is in the subject’s best interest;  
• Occurrence of an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], warrants discontinuation of 
the subject from the study drug;  

SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015270] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 37 
 • Lost to follow up (every attempt should be made t o contact [CONTACT_423])  
The reason for a subject’s discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study will be clearly 
documented in the source documents and on the electronic case report form ( eCRF). All TOC 
procedures should be performed for subject s who discontinue from the study before the TOC visit.  
11.[ADDRESS_1015271] experiences persistence or worsening o r recurrence of symptoms that per the 
investigator’s assessment (e.g., symptoms ≥3) warrant the use of rescue antifungal therapy, a 
vaginal examination with investigator’s rating of signs  should be completed. Additionally , 
vulvovaginal samples should be ob tained for KOH testing and pH measurements by [CONTACT_27396] , fungal culture by [CONTACT_742714].  
If the KOH test is negative, the investigator should consider other causes for the persistence or 
worsening of the symptoms as antifungal rescue medication may not be indicated.  
If the investigator’s rating of the vulvovaginal signs and vaginal sample coll ection is not possible  
prior to the initiation of the rescue therapy, it should still be completed as soon as possible after 
rescue therapy is initiated.  
In addition to the vaginal examination, the symptoms that led to the use of rescue antifungal 
therapy should be documented in the eCRF and the following procedures should also be 
completed:  
• If rescue therapy is administered prior to or at the TOC  visit, all TOC  visit procedures 
should be completed and no additional visits will be needed.  The subject will be considered 
as early termination due to lack of efficacy prior to or at TOC.  
• If rescue therapy is administered after the TOC  visit but prior to  or at the FU visit, all FU 
visit procedures should be completed  and no additional visits will be needed.  The subject 
will be considered as early termination due to lack of efficacy after TOC but prior to or at 
FU. 
Oral fluconazole [one 150 -mg dose] may be provided to study sites as rescue medication. 
However, at the investigator’s discretion other approved antifungal agent may be administered as 
rescue medication to a particular patient for whom fluconazole is not considered the optimal 
option.  All rescue antifungal medication s should be documented in the eCRF.  
Detai ls of study treatment groups and dietary requirements for treatment administration are 
provided in Section  12.1 and Section 12.2, respectively.

number starting at 01, at each site. The subject numbers assigned to eligible subjects will be 
recorded in the eCRF.  This number will be unique to each subject  and will be used to identify the 
subject throughout the study. This number is different from the study drug kit  number.  
Subjects who are screen failures or who are not eligible for randomization will be recorded as such 
in the eCRF . For subjects who sign  an ICF (i.e., are assigned a subject number) but are NOT 
assigned a treatment assignment number because they do not meet all of the inclusion/exclusion 

SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015285] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 43 
 criteria, the applicable Screening visit pages of the eCRF will be completed. The criteria that were 
not met for randomization will be documented in the eCRF.  
14.3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed at Screening and at Baseline  (Day 1) to ensure 
that the subject qualifies for the trial.  
14.[ADDRESS_1015286] results will be reviewed at Baseline (Day 1) before starting/dispensing study drug.   
14.7 Safety Laboratory Tests   
Safety l aboratory tests will be performed by a qualified central laboratory.  Samples for s afety 
laboratory tests will be collected at the Screening  and the  TOC visits and at any unscheduled visit, 
if needed . If indicated, these may be done more frequently as follo w up to a laboratory abnormality.

14.[ADDRESS_1015288] Using the VSS Scale  
Subjects will be asked to rate their vulvovaginal symptoms at Screening, from Day 1 through the 
TOC visit (Day 8-Day 14) and at the FU visit (Day 25 [ (± 4]). Subjects will also assess their 
symptom a t unscheduled visits, as needed.  
If the subject experiences persistence or worsening or recurrence of symptoms that per the 
investigator’s assessment (e.g. symptoms ≥3) warrant the use of rescue antifungal therapy, the 
rating of the symptoms that led to t he use of rescue antifungal therapy must be documented  in the 
eCRF and a vaginal examination with rating of signs by [CONTACT_27403] . If 
the investigator’s  rating of the vulvovaginal signs and vaginal samples collection are not possibl e 
prior to the initiation of the rescue therapy, they should still be completed as soon as possible after 
rescue therapy is initiated.  
Subjects will rate their symptoms of infection using the VSS Scale, where each vulvovaginal 
symptom will be given a nume rical rating based on severity, as follows:  
• Itching: absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3  
• Burning: absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3  
• Irritation: absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = [ADDRESS_1015289] 
diaries.  
14.9 Vulvovaginal Samples for Identification of Other Pathogens and 
Vaginal pH  
A vulvovaginal specimen will be obtained at the Screening visit for local vaginal pH 
determination. Th is samp le will also be tested b y a local qualified laboratory to rule out bacterial 
vaginosis and Trichomonas  vaginalis . Testing for Neisseria  gonorrh oeae, Chlamydia  trachomatis  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015290] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 45 
 or Herpes  virus will also be conducted by a qualified laboratory (local or central laboratory) , if 
clinically indicated. Vaginal samples will be tested for bacterial vaginosis,  T. vaginalis , N. 
gonorrh oeae, C. trachomatis  or Herpes  virus at unscheduled visits only if needed.  This procedure 
should also be completed prior to the i nitiation of rescue therapy. If the vaginal samples collection 
is not possible prior to the initiation of rescue therapy, it should still be completed as soon as 
possible after rescue therapy is initiated.  If there is persistence or recurrence of vulvovag inal 
symptoms, additional vulvovaginal specimens will be collected at the TOC and at the FU visits.  
Procedures for collecting and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_742695].  
14.[ADDRESS_1015291] microscopic examination with 
10% KOH . Subjects must have a positive KOH test at Screening to be randomized to one of the 
study treatment groups. The Screening KOH will be assessed at the site by [CONTACT_193374]. A vaginal sample will also be obtained at Screening and at the TOC visit for 
fungal culture and species identification by [CONTACT_742719] y testing 
against ibrexafungerp and additional antifungal agents  (per CLSI M27 -A3 guidelines) . If there is 
persistence or recurrence of vulvovaginal symptoms, additional vulvovaginal specimens will be 
collected for KOH testing at the TOC and at the FU visi ts, and for fungal culture at the FU visit. 
Samples will also be obtained at any unscheduled visit, if needed.  
If the subject experiences persistence or worsening or recurrence of symptoms that per the 
investigator’s assessment (e.g. symptoms ≥3) warrant the use of rescue antifungal therapy, a 
vaginal examination with collection of samples for KOH (assess at the site) and culture should be 
completed prior to initiation of rescue therapy. If the KOH test is negative, the investigator should 
consider other c auses for the persistence or worsening of the symptoms and antifungal rescue 
medication may not be indicated. If the collection of the vaginal culture is not possible prior to the 
initiation of the rescue therapy, it should still be collected as soon as po ssible after rescue therapy 
is given.  
14.11  Rating of Vulvovaginal Sign s by [CONTACT_606542] (or qualified designee) will perform v ulvovaginal examinations to rate the 
subject´s signs of infection at the Screening  and TOC  visits. The vulvovaginal examination will 
be repeated at the FU visit only if the subject presents symptoms . Otherwise, no additional 
vulvovaginal examination will be conducted or signs rated. Vulvovaginal examination s may be 
conducted at unscheduled visi ts, if needed .  
If the subject experiences persistence or worsening or recurrence of symptoms that per the 
investigator’s assessment (e.g. symptoms ≥3) warrant the use of rescue antifungal therapy, a 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015292] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 46 
 vaginal examination with rating of sig ns by [CONTACT_742720]. If the investigator’s rating of the vulvovaginal signs is not possible prior to the 
initiation of the rescue therapy, it should still be completed as soon as possible after rescue therapy 
is initiated . 
Investigators will assess the signs of infection using the VSS Scale provided in Section 21.0 
[Appendix B]), a standardized , predefined  scale where each sign of the vagina and/or vulva will 
be given a numerical rating based on severity , as follows:  
• Edema : absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3  
• Erythema : absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3  
• Excoriation or fissures : absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = [ADDRESS_1015293] relevant medical term in the abbreviated physical 
examination page  of the eCRF . 
14.12  Randomization  
At Baseline  (Day 1) , subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will 
be randomized to one of the two study treatment groups . Subject randomization will be performed 
using an Interactive Response System (voice or web -based) , which will assign a unique 
randomization number  for each randomized subject  corresponding to a study treatment . Only one 
randomization number and study drug treatment will be assigned to each eligible subject.  
14.[ADDRESS_1015294] Diary Dispensing  
At Baseline  (Day  1), eligible subjects will be dispensed  enough  study medication to permit BID 
dosing of the assigned study medication  (see Section  12.3.2  ) and a subject diary , where the subject 
will rate her vulvovaginal symptoms  of infection and will record study drug dosing details, AEs 
and concomitant medication use daily from Day [ADDRESS_1015295] study drug dose will be preferably administered at the center and the second s tudy drug 
dose will be self -administered by [CONTACT_742721] 12 hours later at home on  Baseline 
(Day 1). The [ADDRESS_1015296] dose at the study center would complicate the adm inistration of the second  dose 12 hours  later 
(e.g. fi rst dose at 3  p.m. will require second dose at 3  a.m.), the subject  can self -administer both 
doses at home  to allow for a more convenient dosing schedule (e.g., 8  p.m. and 8 a.m.). Subjects 
will record study drug dosing details in the ir study diary.  

SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015297] diaries at the 
TOC visit (Day 8-Day 14 ).  
The site will determine if any signs/symptoms or other medical concerns/complaints recorded on 
the diary should be reported as AEs. The i nformation from the subject diary will be included as 
part of the eCRFs.  
14.16  Study Drug Collection and Treatment Compliance Evaluation  
Treatment compliance will be reviewed by [CONTACT_742722]  (Day  8-Day 
14) visit. Subjects will be instructed to bring all bottles (including empty bottles) of study 
medication with them to the visit to assess treatment compliance. Fur ther details are available in 
Section 12.5. 
14.[ADDRESS_1015298] diaries will be collected and reviewed at the TOC visit.  
The site will deter mine if any signs/symptoms or other medical concerns/complaints recorded on 
the diary should be reported as AEs. The information from the subject diary will be included as 
part of the eCRFs.  
14.18  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_742696] , if needed . 
14.19  Prior and Concomitant Medication Review  
All medications (including prescription and over -the-counter medications, supplements, and

a. Screening and Baseline may occur  on the same day.  
b. For subjects under the legal age of consent, the subject’s parent or legal representative will also sign the subject’s ICF.  
c. Results should be reviewed prior to randomization at Baseline (Day 1).  
d. Hematology and blood chemistry. Safety laboratory tests will be performed by a qualified central laboratory.  
e. If the subject experiences persistence or worsening or recurrence of symptoms , after the baseline visit , that per the investigator’s assessment (e.g. 
symptoms ≥3) warrant the use of rescue antifungal therapy, the symptoms that led to the use of rescue antifungal therapy must be documented i n the eCRF  and 
a vaginal examination with rating of signs by [CONTACT_742724]. Additionally, vulvovaginal samples should be obtained  for KOH testing 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015303] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 
 and pH measurement (both at the site), fungal culture (central laboratory) and investigation of other pathogens such as bacte rial vaginosis and Trichomonas  
vaginalis  (at the site). If the investigator’s rating of the vulvovaginal signs and vaginal samples collection are  not possible prior to the initiation of the rescue 
therapy, they should still be completed as soon as possible after rescue therapy is initi ated. 
f. Vulvovaginal examinations will be repeated at the FU visit only if the subject presents symptoms. Otherwise, no additional vu lvovaginal examination 
will be conducted or signs rated .  
g.  Subject diaries will be used to rate vulvovaginal symptoms of infection and record study drug dosing details, AEs and concomi tant medication use.   
h. If administering the first dose at the study center would complicate the administration of the second dose 12  hours later (e.g. first dose at 3 p.m. will 
require second dose at 3 a.m.), the subject can self -administer both doses at home to allow for a more convenient dosing schedule (e.g., 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.). 
Subjects will record study drug dosing details in thei r study diary  
 
  
 
 
 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015304] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug/study intervention , whether or not 
related to the study drug/study intervention . 
Any laboratory abnormality  that is deemed to be clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_27350], whether or not 
it is related to the study drug.  
Stable chronic conditions that are presen t prior to clinical trial enrollment  and do not 
worsen are not considered AEs and will be accounted for in the subject ’s medical history.  
The following can be considered AEs:  
• An exacerbation of a pre -existing illness  
• An increase in frequency or intensity o f a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]  
• A condition detected or diagnosed after the initiation of treatment with study 
medication, even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present a t Baseline that worsen after 
signing the informed consent or following the initiation of treatment with study 
medication  
The follow ing are not considered AEs:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. , surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction or 
transfusion); the c ondition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that 
do not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g.,  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27352]/convenience 
admissions)  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015305] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 
 • The disease being studied or signs or symptoms associated with the disease, unless 
more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition  or a worsening of the disease 
being studied  
16.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined as an AE meeting one of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Any other important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes may 
be considered a SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical judgme nt, the event may 
jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above.  
A life -threatening AE is any AE that places the subject , in the view of the i nvestigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
16.[ADDRESS_1015306] (ECIs)  if the y occur after dosing , 
and must be  reported by [CONTACT_27438] : 
• ALT or AST > 8 x the upper limit of normal ( ULN ), confirmed by [CONTACT_601269]  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1015307] for more than 2 weeks  if new compared to Baseline , 
confirmed by [CONTACT_601269]  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1015308] and total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_1015309] if new compared to 
Baseline , confirmed by [CONTACT_601269]  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1015310], with the appearance of fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (>  5%) 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015311] be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy.   If 
the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify 
the Sponsor .  At the completion of the pregnancy, the investigator  will document the 
outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
neonatal death or congenital anomaly), the investigator  should follow the procedures for 
reporting an SAE.  
16.6 Unexpected  Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is of greater specificity or 
severity than those that have been observed with the particular study drug being tes ted.  For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, 
cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpecte d (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  "Unexpected," as used 
in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological  properties of the drug but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015312] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 
 16.7 Grading of Adverse Events  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject ’s 
daily activities and will be classified by [CONTACT_27414], moderate or severe using 
the following criteria:  
• Mild:   Awareness of sign or symptom, but easil y tolerated.  Not likely to require 
medical attention.  
• Moderate:   Discomfort enough to cause some interference with daily activity .  May 
require medical intervention.  
• Severe:  Intense enough to disrupt daily activities .  Likely requires medical 
intervention.  
Clarification of the difference in meaning between “severe” and “serious”  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as 
in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, howev er, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events 
that pose a threat to life or functioning.  Seriousness (not s everity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
16.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator will assess causality (i .e., whether there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs.  The relation ship will be characterized 
using the following classification:  
• Related:  The temporal relationship of the AE with the study drug makes causality 
possible  and as likely or more likely than  due to another cause such as other drugs, 
a surgical intervention or  an underlying disease.  
• Not related:  The temporal relationship of the AE with the study drug makes 
causality improbable and can be due to another cause such as other drugs, a surgical 
intervention  or an underlying disease.  
16.9 Adverse Event Collection Timefra me 
All AEs  and SAEs will be recorded from  the time informed consent is obtained through  
the FU visit (end of study) .   
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015313]  or observed by [CONTACT_606546]  (PI) or qualified designee . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_27354], if 
possible, to establish a diagnosis based on presenting signs and symptoms.  The nature of 
the AE, time of onse t relative to study drug administration, duration, severity, and 
relationship to treatment should be determined. Details of any corrective treatment must be 
recorded in the eCRF . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_606508]. All AEs and SAEs will be collected in the eCRF . 
16.[ADDRESS_1015314]/Ethics Committee 
(IRB/EC) in accordance with its regulations and guidelines.  
16.11  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow -up 
All AEs and SAEs will be followed up to resolution (the subject ’s health has r eturned to 
her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal) or until an outcome is reached, 
stabilization occurs (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the event) or the event is otherwise explained, regardle ss of whether the 
subject  is still participating in the study. All appropriate therapeutic measures should be 
undertaken and recorded. Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be 
performed to document resolution of the event (s). 
16.12  Serious Adver se Event  Reporting – Procedures for Investigators  
Initial Reports and Follow -Up SAE Reports :  To report an SAE, the SAE eCRF form within 
the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system must be completed. All SAEs, whether or not 
deemed drug -related or expected, m ust be reported by [CONTACT_606547] [ADDRESS_1015315] becoming aware of the event.  The investigator/qualified designee 
will enter the required information regarding the SAE into the appropriate form, which will 
automatically r esult in distribution of the information to the appropriate sponsor contact  
[CONTACT_606548] (>24 hours), the event, including the 
investigator -determined causality to study drug, should be reported via a paper back -up 
SAE form to the Safety Surveillance team via (contact [CONTACT_3031], i.e., e-mail or fax will 
be available on the SAE form).   
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015316] be 
updated within 24 hours of knowledge/receipt of SAE follow -up information.  
16.13  Procedures for Emergency Unblinding  
This is a double -blind, double -dummy study.  The Investigator should only be unblinded if 
it is necessary to determine treatment of emergency.  The study personnel responsible for 
the treatment assignment  can provide the information necessary to unblind the investigator  
(evaluator) , in case of an eme rgency. If the evaluator is unbli nded, the rea son for 
unblinding  should be documented in the comment page of the eCRF.

 The Sponsor will inform the PI/institution in writing of the need for record retention and 
will not ify the PI/institution in writing when the trial -related records are no longer needed.  
An investigator who withdraws from the responsibility of maintaining study records or 
wishes to move them to a new location has the obligation to place them in safekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_606509].  
18.0 Analytical Plan   
All statistical processing  will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later, unless 
otherwise stated.  All statistical tests will be two -sided and interpreted at a 5% significance 
level.  
Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, etc.) 
will be provided for all continuous variables; frequencies and percentages will be presented 
for incidence and categorical variables.  For parameters measured over time, observed 
values and changes from Baseline will be described for each time point.  
The clinic al cure and mycological eradication rates will be described by [CONTACT_742704], when the number of isolates per species allows.  
All analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] .  Unless otherwise stated, d ata will be 
analyzed as is with no imput ation.  No adjustment for multiplicity will be employed.  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describing all statistical analyses in detail will be 
provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study 
treatments.  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015322] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 
 18.1 Sample Size Determination  
The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects achieving a clinical cure at 
the TOC visit. Assuming clinical cure rates of 50% and 30% for ibrexafungerp and placebo 
administered in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, approximatel y 282 subjects will provide 90% 
power to detect a difference between ibrexafungerp and placebo based on a P earson’s Chi-
square d test with a Type 1 error rate of 5%. Because it is expected that approximately 20% 
of subjects may not have a mycological cultur e-confirmed infection at Baseline and 
approximately 10% may withdraw early from the study, an additional 84 subjects are added 
for a total of 366 subjects (244 subjects randomized to ibrexafungerp and 122 subjects, to 
placebo).  
18.2 Analysis Populations  
The stu dy populations to be used in the analyses are defined as follows:  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:  All randomized subjects.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population:  All randomized subjects who have a 
positive culture for Candida  species at Baseline.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population:  All mITT  subjects who have completed the study drug 
treatment AND who have a TOC evaluation.  
Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug 
and who have at least one post -Baseline evaluation.  
18.[ADDRESS_1015323] demographics 
and baseline characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sex, weight, height, body mass 
index, region  (if applicable)  and other relevant parameters will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6490].  
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment prior to the date (and time if 
appropriate) of the first dose of study drug.  Change from baseline is defined as:  post-
baseline value – baseline value.  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015324] a TOC (Day 8-Day 14 ) assessment will 
be assigned as treatment failures. For subjects who withdraw from the study early, every 
effort will be made to collect  TOC visit information at the point of withdrawal . 
18.[ADDRESS_1015325] dose of study drug will be  considered 
concomitant medications.  
18.6 Efficacy  
18.6.1  Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of subjects with clinical cure 
(complete resolution of signs and symptoms) at the TOC visit. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints includ e the percentage of subjects with  mycological eradication  (negative culture  
for growth of  Candida  species ) at the TOC visit,  the percentage of subjects with clinical  
cure and mycological eradication  at the TOC visit, the percentage of subjects with complete 
resolution of symptoms at the FU visit, and the percentage of subjects with clinical 
improvement (partial or complete resolution of signs and symptoms with a total composite 
score no greater than 1) at the TOC visit  and the absolute change in sign s and symptoms 
score from Baseline to TOC and FU visits .  
The following treatment outcome definitions will be used for the assessment of efficacy  
relative to baseline : 
Clinical Outcome  
• Clinical cure: Complete resolution of signs and symptoms of vulvovagina l infection 
without need for further antifungal treatment. Specifically, for complete resolution,  any 
sign or symptom should be absent (score = 0) by [CONTACT_477743].  
• Clinical failure:  No response to therapy or incomplete resolution of signs and 
symptoms or need for additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal therapy. If the 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015326] receives or self -administers topi[INVESTIGATOR_606510]/pruritus  such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_606511], the subject is 
considered a clinical failure.  
Mycological Outcome  
• Mycological eradication:  A subject with negative culture for Candida species .  
• Mycological persistence:  A subject with a positive culture for Candida  species . 
18.6.2  Efficacy Analyses  
The efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT (primary analysis population), ITT 
and PP popula tions to evaluate ibrexafungerp  vs. placebo.  
The primary endpoint, percentage of subjects with clinical cure at TOC, will be analyzed 
using a Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted for site ; the p -value and 95% 
confidence intervals will be presented. Missing Day 8-Day 14  (TOC) data for the primary 
endpoint will be imputed as failures in the analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be performed 
where subjects with missing values will be removed from the analysis. All other d ata will 
be analyzed as is with no imputation.  
For other continuous efficacy endpoints, a two -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model 
will be used including effects for treatment and site ; p-values and 95% confidence intervals 
will be presented. For other categorical endpoints, the CMH test adjusted for site  will be 
performed, and p -values and 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
 
18.7 Safety  
18.7.1  Safety Assessments  
Safety will be evaluated throughout the study,  including the foll owing parame ters: AEs, 
treatment discontinuations, physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, and 
prior and concomitant medications . 
AEs will be recorded and reviewed at all scheduled and unscheduled study visits from the 
time the Informed  Consent Form is signed. An abbreviated physical examination, including 
general appearance and an overall examination of body systems, will be conducted at 
Screening and at the TOC visit. Vital signs, including blood pressure (systolic and 
diastolic), hear t rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_742697], and at unscheduled visits, if needed. Safety laboratory tests 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  IND # 107,[ADDRESS_1015327] 2018 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 
 (hematology and blood chemistry) will be measured at Screening, at the TOC visit and at 
unschedule d visits, if needed. All prior and concomitant medications taken before Baseline 
(Day 1) through the TOC visit will be recorded. Only the use of antifungal medications, 
vaginal (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) medications, antibiotics for any reason or any other medications to t reat 
an AE will be recorded after the TOC visit through the last study visit (FU).  
Safety procedures are described in Section  14.0 and safety assessments are described in 
Section  16.0. 
18.7.2  Analyses  
Safety analyses wil l be conducted using the safety population.  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Version 19.1 or higher. The i ncidence and severity of treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs 
and their relationship to treatment will be summarized  by [CONTACT_72065]. The percentage of subjects  who discontinued study treatment and the reasons for 
discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . 
Safety laboratory evaluations  and vital signs will be summarized as observed values  and 
as changes from B aseline . In additio n, shifts (with respect to the reference range) from 
Baseline  will be presented by [CONTACT_606553] .

 Medications to be administered with Caution  and Monitored as Appropriate  
CYP3A4 substrates  
CYP  Substrates  
3A4 In vitro , ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) was an inhibitor of CYP3A mediated metabolism of 
midazolam, but was only a weak inhibitor of metabolism of testosterone. The clinical 
significance of this inhibition is unknown; caution should be exercised when 
administering ibrexafu ngerp  (SCY -078) with drugs known to be CYP3A sensitive 
substrates with narrow therapeutic index , such as midazolam  and cyclosporine . 
Subjects receiving sirolimus , tacrolimus , warfarin , cyclosporine or amiodarone  are 
permitted for enrollment in the study and these medications may be administered 
concomitantly with ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) with close monitoring. Dosing 
adjustments and subsequent monitoring of sirolimus and warfarin should be undertaken 
in accordance  with product prescribing information for the respective agents.  
 
OATP1B3 substrates  
OATP  Substrate  
1B3 In vitro , ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) is an inhibitor of the OATP1B3 liver uptake 
transporter.  The clinical significance of this inhibition is unknown; however, there is 
a potential risk for increased exposure of the concomitant medications (arising from 
lowered hepatic clearance) when admini stering ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) with drugs 
known to be OATP1B3 selective substrates.  Therefore, caution should be exercised 
when administering ibrexafungerp  (SCY -078) with drugs known to be OATP1B3 
selective substrates such as telmisartan, including monito ring the subject for signs of 
overexposure associated with the concomitant medications as described in the product 
prescribing information.

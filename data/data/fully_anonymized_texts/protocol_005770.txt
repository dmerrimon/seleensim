Study Site: Spaulding Clinical Research LLC, [ADDRESS_585079] Bend, WI53095
Background and 
Motivation:Sunscreens prevent skin damage by [CONTACT_458092] (UV) radiation and they are regulated as drug products in 
the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.). Most active ingredients in sunscreens are 
organic chemicals and some have been shown to be absorbed 
through human skin with detectable levels in the blood or urine. As 
part of the safety evaluation for sunscreen products, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) requests an assessment of systemic 
absorption in humans so that human blood levels can be compared 
with exposure levels obtained in nonclinical toxicology studies. If 
testing establishes that the sunscreen is not absorbed through the skin 
into the body, some aspects of toxicology testing may not be needed.
Sunscreen products may be applied multiple times daily as both 
primary sunscreen products and as ingredients in cosmetic products, 
in substantial amounts for a lifetime starting at [ADDRESS_585080] can vary, but permitted 
levels can be as high as 15% for some organic active ingredients and 
application to the skin can accumulate to gram quantities in a day 
even with modest use. Because of the significant use of these 
sunscreens, even a low percentage of systemic absorption (e.g., 
0.1%) could represent a significant systemic exposure in a single day 
and over a lifetime.
The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer calls 
on partners in prevention from various sectors across the nation to 
address skin cancer as a major public health problem by [CONTACT_458093]. 
Given the recognized public health benefits of sunscreen use, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 8 of 54 Version 1.4FDA is committed to finding ways to facilitate the marketing of 
sunscreen products that include additional over-the-counter (OTC) 
sunscreen active ingredients. The FDA will continue to work with 
industry and other public health agencies to ensure that the 
sunscreens consumers use are safe and effective for daily, life-long
use.
In November 2016, the U.S. FDA finalized the guidance titled 
“Guidance for Industry: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products 
Safety and Effectiveness Data” (sunscreen guidance). The guidance 
requests an assessment of the human systemic absorption of
sunscreen ingredients with a Maximum Usage Trial (MUsT). The 
FDA sunscreen guidance notes that some nonclinical toxicity studies 
may be waived if results of an adequately conducted human 
pharmacokinetic (PK) MUsT show a steady-state blood level less 
than 0.5 ng/mL.
Periodically, the FDA performs testing of products and formulations 
that the Agency sees as important for public health. This testing is 
not a reflection of rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but instead 
is done independently to measure the agency’s understanding of the 
products’ overall safety and effectiveness.
This study is not intended to meet all requirements of MUsT studies 
as outlined in the FDA guidance referenced above, but will follow 
many of the principles.
Summary and 
Objectives:Part 1is an open-label, randomized, 4-arm study in 24 healthy adult 
subjects with the primary objective:
To explore whether the active components (avobenzone, 
oxybenzone, ecamsule and octocrylene) of 4 sunscreen products 
([ADDRESS_585081] in each arm) are absorbed into the systemic 
circulation when a sunscreen productis applied under 
maximal-use conditions. 
One sunscreen product with the highest avobenzone exposure will be 
selected for the second part of the study. If there is no quantifiable 
exposure of avobenzone for any of the sunscreen products, the 
formulation with the highest oxybenzone exposure will be selected 
for Part 2. In addition,3 new sunscreen products are being included 
in Part 2.
Part 2is an open-label, 4-arm study in 48 healthy adult subjects with 
the following primary objective:
To assess the systemic absorption and pharmacokinetics of the 
active components (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene,
ecamsule, homosalate, octisalate and octinoxate, where applicable
[Part 2 products will not contain ecamsule]) of4 sunscreen 
products ([ADDRESS_585082] in each arm) under maximal-use 
conditions.

Part 2 is an open-label, 4-arm study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics 
of avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate and 
octinoxate (where applicable [Part 2 products will not contain 
ecamsule]) after multiple applications of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_458065]. Part 2 will include 48 subjects 
(24 male and 24 female) and each arm will include 12 subjects (6 
male and 6 female). One of the formulations in Part 2 will be 
selected based on the plasma exposure data from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Part 
1) along with 3additional formulations. A total of 48subjects (24
male and 24female) will be admitted to the CRU on Day0. On the 
morning of Days [ADDRESS_585084] dose.
Parts 1 and 2
In both parts, approximately 2 mg of active sunscreen ingredient per 
1 cm2of body surface (calculation per method of Dubois) will be 
evenly applied 4times per study day(except for a one-time 
application on the first day in part 2)to areas of thebody typi[INVESTIGATOR_458066]: face, ears, neck, torso, arms, and legs 
(approximately 75% of the body surface area). The antecubital areas 
will be avoided when applying the sunscreen due to potential 
contamination of the sites used for intravenous PK blood sample 
collection. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_458067]-world 
settings as well as for easy application. In addition to swim wear, 
subjects may wear scrubs in between applications and at other times 
throughout the day/night. Subjects arerequired to shower each 
morning afterthe first PK blood sample collection(and before the 
first dose of the day), but not at other times during the day.
Blood samples (approximately 10 mL per sample) will be collected 
for determination of plasma concentrations for all active ingredients
(avobenzone, oxybenzone,octocrylene, ecamsule, homosalate, 
octisalate and octinoxate, where applicable).
Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital 
sign measurements, and physical examinations. All AEs reported by 
[CONTACT_458094] 
(CRU)staff will be recorded. Any AE reported after the informed 
consent is signed and before study drug application will be recorded 
as medical history.
Subjects will remain in the CRU after admission on Day0 until the 
morning ofDay 7 following completion of scheduled End-of-Study
activitiesfor part 1. For part 2, subjects will undergo the same

13 December 2018 Page 22 of 54 Version [IP_ADDRESS] Common Procedures
Details of study visits and study procedures are described in Section 5.6 and Section 5.7,
respectively, and the overall Schedule of Events for both parts of the study is presented in 
Section 10.1.
In both parts of the study, approximately 2 mg of sunscreen per 1 cm2of body surface 
(calculation per method of Dubois) will be evenly applied 4 times per study day(except 
for a one-time application on the first day in part 2)to areas of the body typi[INVESTIGATOR_458078]: face, ears, neck, torso, arms, and legs (approximately 75% of the body surface 
area). The antecubital areas will be avoided when applying the sunscreen due to potential 
contamination of the sites used for intravenous (IV) PK blood sample collection. The 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_458079]. In addition to swim wear, 
subjects may wear scrubs in between applications and at other times throughout the 
day/night. Subjects are required to shower each morning afterthe first PK blood sample 
collection (and before the first sunscreen application for that day), but not at other times 
during the day. And, subjects should not use any personal care products which contain 
avobenzone, oxybenzone, ecamsule, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate or octinoxate
during the study.
Blood samples (approximately 10 mL per sample) will be collected for determination of 
avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, ecamsule, homosalate, octisalate and octinoxate 
(where applicable)plasma concentrations.
Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital sign measurements, 
and physical examinations. All AEs reported by [CONTACT_458100]. Any AE reported after the informed consent is 
signed and before study drug application will be recorded as medical history.
Subjects will remain in the CRU after admission on Day 0 until discharge on the morning 
of Day 7. In Part 2, subjects will return to the clinicon Day 10, 14 and 21 for follow-up
PK sampling(Days 10, 14 and 21)and tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Days 14).
Subjects are not allowed to use products containing any of theactive ingredients from 7
days before check-in until completion of End-of-Study procedures.
5.1.5 Risk/Benefit
Subjects will be informed that participation in a human PK study like the present one 
cannot be of benefit to healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, the information from the 
physical examination, vital sign measurements, and ECG results may be shared with the

a change in the known risk profile for the study drug(s), such that the risk is no longer 
acceptable for subjects participating in the study.
Significant violation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to 
achieve the primary study objective or compromises subject safety.
5.4.2 Criteria for Termination of Investigational Site
The study site may be terminated if the site (including the investigator) is found in 
significant violation of GCP, the protocol, the contractual agreement, or is unable to

study-specific procedure for early termination will be provided by [CONTACT_456]; the 
procedure will be followed by [CONTACT_458106].
5.5. Criteria for Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_458107]’s clinical judgment. A subject is not required to provide a written request to 
withdraw from the study; however, a written request is required if a subject withdraws 
consent for his or her personaldata to be used for study-related purposes.
A subject may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:
AE: The subject has experienced an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
requires early termination. The appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) must 
be completed for each AE. If a subject is discontinued from the study due to an AE, 
the investigator is required to follow up with the subject until the event resolves or 
becomes stable. If a subject dies during the study, the cause of death must be reported 
as a serious AE (SAE), with an outcome of death noted in the eCRF.
Protocol Violation: The subject failed to meet protocol entry criteria or did not adhere 
to protocol requirements, and continued participation poses an unnecessary risk to the 
subject’s health.
Withdrawal by [CONTACT_27720]: The subject (or other responsible individual [e.g., caregiver]) 
wishes to withdraw from the study in the absence of a medical need.
NOTE: Withdrawal due to an AE should not be recorded in the “voluntary 
withdrawal” category.
Study Terminated by [CONTACT_2728]: The sponsor, IRB, FDA, or other regulatory agency 
terminates the study.
Pregnancy: The subject is found to be pregnant.
NOTE: If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn 
immediately. The pregnancy will be followed up to term, and the outcome, including 
any premature termination will be recorded. All live births must be followed for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_585109] well baby [CONTACT_765].

study when the subject meets the criteria described in Section 5.5. In addition, a subject 
may discontinue his or her participation without giving a reason at any time during the 
study. Subjects will be informed that their participation in the study is voluntary, that 
refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled, and that the subject may discontinue participation at any time without 
penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.
Should a subject’s participation be discontinued, the primary reason for termination must 
be recorded. In addition, efforts should be made to perform all procedures scheduled for 
the early termination visit. Any data and samples collected before subject withdrawal will 
become the property of the sponsor.
5.5.2 Replacement Subjects
Approximately 72 healthy subjects are planned for enrollment, of which 24 subjects will 
be enrolled and randomized in Part 1 and 48 subjects will be enrolled and randomizedin 
Part 2. Up to 18 subjects may be qualified as replacements. Thus, a maximum of 
90 subjects may be exposed to study drugs and procedures during the study.
5.6. Study Visits
5.6.1 Recruitment
Recruitment materials (e.g., internet, radio, and print advertisements, social media posts) 
will be approved by [CONTACT_458108]. The sponsor is responsible 
for registration of the study on clinicaltrials.gov; however, this may not occur until the 
IRB has approved the final study protocol.
[IP_ADDRESS] Compensation
Subjects will be offered payment for Screening; however, if the results of theiralcohol 
and drug screening tests are positive, they will not be compensated. Subjects who 
complete the entire study (Day0 to Day 7 in Part 1 orDay 0 to Day 21 in Part2) will 
receive payment according to the schedule provided in the informed consent form. No 
special incentives are offered. Final payment will not be released until all follow-up

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Specimen Handling
The PK blood samples (10 mL each) will be collected into tubes containing K 2EDTA, 
inverted several times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant, and placed in an ice bath. 
Within 30 minutes of collection, the samples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes, at 
3000 revolutions per minute, at 4°C, by a study team member.
The plasma will be separated using a disposable plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_458084] A 
(primary) and Aliquot B (backup). The plasma samples will be appropriately labeled and 
stored frozen at –70°C or below until shipment. Temperature monitoring logs should be 
maintained and accessible for review by [CONTACT_11200].
The Aliquot A samples (primary) will be shipped first, on dry ice, to the bioanalytical 
laboratory at FDA for processing when requested by [CONTACT_456]. The Aliquot B samples 
(backup) will be held for a second shipment at a time after the completion of all Aliquot 
A sample shipment(s) and the timing of the Aliquot B shipment communicated by [CONTACT_103]. None of the PK blood samples will be stored at clinical facility for future use,
however the sponsor will store them for analytical purposes of this study only.

5.7.2 Safety Assessments
Safety will be evaluated in terms of AEs, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart 
rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body temperature), and physical examination findings.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_585121] and/or unintended sign, including an abnormal clinical 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Events or conditions that 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Confidential
Protocol No. SCR-005
13 December 2018 Page 35 of 54 Version 1.4increase in frequency or severity during or as a consequence of use of a drug in human 
clinical trials will also be considered AEs.
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that begins after study 
drug administration.
An unexpected AE is any AE having a specificity or severity not consistent with the 
current investigator’s brochure for the study drug(s).
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that meets the following criteria:
Results in death,
Is life threatening,
Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
Is an important medical event that may not meet the previous criteria but, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, jeopardizes the subject or requires medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent oneof the outcomes listed previously.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_585122] signs the informed consent form and 
will continue until discharge (or early termination). All AEs, whether serious or 
nonserious and whether or not related to the study drug, must be recorded in the eCRF. 
Study subjects will be instructed to warn study staff if he or she has any unexpected 
symptoms. In addition, all subjects will receive a reminder telephone call approximately 
24 hours before Check-in.
Any SAE (whether expected or unexpected) must be entered into the eCRF system and 
reported by [CONTACT_458112] [ADDRESS_585123] be reported promptly to the 
investigator’s IRB as per the IRB’s requirements.
In the event of a fatal or life-threatening SAE, the sponsor will notify the appropriate 
FDA authorities by [CONTACT_332512] [ADDRESS_585124] possibly related to the study drug will be 
submitted in writing to the FDA within 10 working days of receipt.
Furthermore, any AEs that are not expected, occur at a higher frequency, or would 
require modification of the study protocol and/or informed consent must be reported to 
the FDA within 10 working days.
Adverse events that are assessed by [CONTACT_458113]. All SAEs will be followed 
until resolution.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Assessment of Severity
The investigator will assess the severity of each AE using the following scale:
Mild: The subject is aware of the AE but is still able to perform all activities; minimal 
or no medical intervention or therapy is required.
Moderate: The subject has to discontinue some activities due to the AE; minimal or 
no medical intervention or therapy is required.
Severe: The subject is incapacitated by [CONTACT_458114]; significant medical intervention or therapy is required and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107550].
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Assessment of Causality
The investigator will assess the causal relationship/relatedness of each AE to the study 
drug using the following scale:
Not Related: Onset of the AE has no reasonable temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug, a causal relationship to administration of the study 
drug is biologically implausible, or the event is attributed to an alternative etiology.
Unlikely Related: Onset of the AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study 
drug administration and although a causal relationship is unlikely, it is biologically 
plausible.
Possibly Related: Onset of the AE has a strong temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug, cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or 
other factors, and a causal relationship is biologically plausible.
Probably Related: Onset of the AE shows a distinct temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
state or other factors, the AE is a known reaction to the product or chemical group, or 
can be predicted by [CONTACT_77425]’s pharmacology.

5.8.2 Method Assigning Subjects to Treatment
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization Process
Part [ADDRESS_585127] biostatistician (or designee) will generate a 
dummy randomization schedule. The schedule is generated by a SAS®/ R or other
program, which produces output file(s) and/or SAS or R dataset(s).
The project biostatistician (or designee) distributes the ‘dummy’ randomization schedule 
to specified personnel for review. Any change (e.g., change in block size, change in 
stratification levels) that requires an update to the specifications will reset this process. 
Minor changes (e.g., display formatting) will not require a change to the specifications.
No transfer is necessary if the unblinded randomization biostatistician also created the 
‘dummy’ randomization.
The randomization biostatistician is responsible for generating the final randomization 
schedule. 
Randomization will occur after informed consent is obtained, either after completion of 
check-in procedures on Day0 or just before dosingon Day1. Unique subject numbers 
will be used in sequential order based on each subject’s order of qualification.

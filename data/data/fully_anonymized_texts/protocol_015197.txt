PI/Site :   
Objective:  
 This pi[INVESTIGATOR_578859].  
Patient Population:  This study is intended for patients undergoing left atrial ablation including pulmonary vein isolation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.  
Study Design : Prospective,  single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_578860]:  This prospective interventional pi[INVESTIGATOR_578861] ( ensoETM ) to actively cool the 
esophagus  when RF ablation s are performed on the posterior atrial wall 
and to actively warm the patient at al l other times to minimize 
perioperative hypothermia.  
In consented participants , following induction of anesthesia and 
intubation, the ensoETM  will be placed into the esophagus according to 
the device Instructions  and maintained at 40-42°C. Active cooling will be 
initiated approximately 15  minutes prior to any ablation s placed on the 
posterior left atrium. The ensoETM  will continuously circulate 4 -6°C water 
inside the device  during all ablations directed at the posterior wall of the 
atrium. Once all ablations to the posterior wall of the  atrium are complete, 
the water set-point will be returned to nominal until the conclusion of the 
procedure.   Total procedure time from trans -septal puncture to pulmonary 
vein isolation (PVI) will be recorded.   
All patients will be followed up in total for 6 weeks (Long Term FU visit) after the procedure to document any clinical complication related to 
thermal esophageal injuries if applicable . 
Study Duration : The study duration is projected to be approximately 145 days (estimated 3-month enrollment and a 6 -week long term follow -up window).  
Inclusion Criteria : 1. Adult patients (age over 18 years)

Active esophageal cooling during RF ablation as a means of esophageal injury  prevention  has been 
investigated through  mathematical mode ls, pre -clinical studies , and in clinical trials. Existing data 
support the efficacy of this approach, but  the practice has  not been widely adopt ed due to lack of a 
commercially available device . 9-16

7 RISK MANAGEMENT  
7.1 RISK ANALYSIS  
Risk analysis associated with the ensoETM  device has been performed in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE]: 
Application of Risk Management to Medical Devices.  
Risk Management activities include  
• Identification of intended use  
• Identification of Hazards – Biological, En vironmental, Radiation  
• Estimation of Risk

  17 • Risk Evaluation  
• Risk Control  
• Evaluation of overall residual risk  
• Risk Management Report  
The Attune Medical ensoETM  has received CE Marking  and FDA 510(k) clearance,  and its intended use is 
as a thermal regulating device intended to connect to an external heat exchanger in order to modulate 
and control patient temperature. The ensoETM  is constructed from medical grade silicone with an outer 
diameter of 12mm (36 Fr), length of 758mm, and circulating water volume of 55 mL. Distilled  water 
circulates inside the tube (never entering the patient), directly cooling the esophageal tissue.  The device 
is placed similarly to an orogastric tube.  Risks associated with ensoETM  use are similar to those of 
standard orogastric tubes.  
The overall risks associated with this study are the same risks associated with standard catheter 
ablation, including standard esophageal temperature monitoring.  
7.1.1  Risk Analysis of esophageal damage related to AF ablation  
Esophageal injury is a well- established risk associated with AF ablation procedures. Current strategies to 
minimize injury risk include reducing energy and force while ablating the left posterior atrial wall and 
luminal esophageal temperature (LET) monitoring. Neither strategy actively prevents esophageal injury, as esophageal thermal damage related to AF ablation procedures can be detected in up to 60% of 
asymptomatic patients undergoing post -ablation endoscopy . 
However, early studies of active esophageal cooling have demonstrated various levels of protection . 
These studies encompass many devices  (primarily with various balloon configurations) and have  been 
investigated with mathematical modeling, preclinical models, and in clinical trials. The preponderanc e of 
data sho ws the effectiveness of the approach,  especially among high flow rate devices,  but the 
applications were  limitations by [CONTACT_578875] (early prototypes were complicated 
to use or  deformed the atria from ballooning of the dev ice).  
The ensoETM  accommodates high flow rate without causing esophageal deformity. The device has been 
used safely in thousands of critical care patients. We expect there to be no incremental risk associated with the use of the ensoETM  during compared to the existing approach. Unlike temperature monitoring 
strategies that prompt reactive strategies (such as pausing ablation)  this approach may actively reduce  
tissue damage  while improving procedural efficiency and reducing the time under anesthesia .

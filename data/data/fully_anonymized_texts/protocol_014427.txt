1. Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable governm ent 
regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
1.1 Background  
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the largest single known cause of mental retardation 
and developmental disability (Abel, 1995). Estimates suggest that the incidence of FAS 
is nearly 1 per 1000 live births in the general population and 4.3% among heavy 
drinkers (Abel, 1995; May & Gossage, 2001). Perhaps more importantly, the incidence 
of the wider spectrum of disorders associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (FASD) is 
thought to be as high as .9% of the general population (Sampson et al., 1997). At 
present, a diagnosis of FAS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_136981]: 1. 
prenatal alcohol exposure (documented or not documented); 2. dysmorphic facial features; 3. grow th deficiency; 4. central nervous system dysfunction (Hoyme et al., 
2005; K. L. Jones & Smith, 1973). However, it is well -established that most prenatally 
exposed individuals do not display the physical characteristics of FAS, but many do have structural brain anomalies and neurocognitive impairment (Bookstein et al., 2001; Burden et al., 2005b; Mattson et al., 1998; Sowell et al.,  
2001a).  
 
As it has become clear that alcohol exposure has serious and permanent adverse effects on cognitive, behavioral, emoti onal, and social development, even without 
producing the complete FAS syndrome, the disorder has been reframed numerous times in recognition of various “partial” FAS conditions including Fetal Alcohol Effects or FAE (Clarren & Smith, 1978) and Alcohol -Related Neurobehavioral Disorder or ARND 
(Institute of Medicine, 1996). Currently, the term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders 
(FASD) is now commonly used to describe the entire spectrum of disability resulting 
from prenatal alcohol exposure (Riley & McGee, 2005; Warren et al., 2004). This FASD continuum includes, by [CONTACT_137006], 5 to 15 times as many children as those diagnosed with full -criteria FAS (Lupton et al., 2004; May & Gossage, 2001; Sokol et al., 
1980). When one considers the estimates of the US economic impact, which are in the 
billions of dollars per year (Lupton et al., 2004; Rice et al., 1991), and the fact that FAS 
represents only the tip of the iceberg, the staggering nature of the public health problem 
posed by [CONTACT_137007].  
 
At present, the literature on interventions for individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum 
Disorders (FASD) is very limited, with only two published randomized controlled trials 
(Premji et al., 2007). However, there are promising new treatment optio ns that have not 
been applied in humans. Specifically, recent pre- clinical studies have shown that dietary 
choline supplementation prenatally and even postnatally, as late as days 21- 30 in the 
rodent (equivalent to human childhood), attenuates the memory and behavioral deficits 
associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (J. D. Thomas et al., 2007; J. D. Thomas et 
al., 2000). Perinatal choline levels directly influence brain development (Zeisel &  
Page 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota. Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_137008], 2006) and, thus, a human clinical trial involving choline supplementation is 
warranted. The fact that postnatal choline supplementation is effective in rats as late as 
21-[ADDRESS_155574] be consumed in food. Human cells require 
choline and, without it, die by [CONTACT_20983] (Albright et al., 1998; Eagle, 1955; Zeisel et al., 1997). Choline has been classified as an essential nutrient,  and guidelines for 
“adequate intake” of choline have been established for infants, children, and adults (Food and Nutrition Board -  Institute of Medicine, 1998). The guidelines also identify 
adequate intake levels specifically for pregnant and lactating w omen because of the 
recognized importance of choline to fetal / neonatal development. A recent study suggests that daily consumption by [CONTACT_137009] (mean = 312 mg. per day for men and 314 mg. per day for women) is significantly below the re commended 
‘adequate daily intake’ of 550 mg. per day for men and 425 mg. per day for women (Cho et al., 2006). Choline is found in many foods but it has only been within the last few years that the specific choline content of various foods and food product s was 
published (Zeisel et al., 2003). Foods highest in choline include eggs, liver, nuts, fish, and soy. Choline is also considered part of the Vitamin B-complex.  
 
Choline exists in a free form or esterfied in one of several phospholipid forms including phosphatidylcholine, glycerol -phosphocholine and sphingomyelin. It is also found in the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine. As a precursor to acetylcholine, phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and betaine, choline is critical to the formation of cell membranes, transmembrane signal ing, 
cholinergic neurotransmission, and the metabolism of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_136982] (Food and Nutrition Board -  Institute of Medicine, 1998). In the context of brain development, 
choline is intricately linked to another essential nutrient, folate, and deficiencies in either nutrient lead to disruptions in neural tube closure (Shaw et al., 2004; Smithells et al., 1976; Zeisel, 2009b). Historical experiences with folate, iron, and iodine fortification have dramatically demonstrated the importance of essential nutrients during periods of development. For example, when cereal grains were first fortified with folic acid, the rates of neural tube birth defects dropped by 26% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004). Although choline deficiency during pregnancy likely has less dramatic effects than folate deficiency, very little is actually known about the impact of deficiency or supplementation during critical developmental  periods.  
Page [ADDRESS_155575] demonstrated that : 
 
1. Perinatal choline deficiency results in abnormal brain development and cognitive 
impairment (Albright et al., 1999b; Holmes -McNary et al., 1997; Wong -Goodrich et al., 
2008) and 2. Perinatal choline supplementation contributes to structural brain changes  
(Li et al., 2004) and enhanced performance on measures of cognition including memory 
(Cheng et al., 2008; Meck et al.,1988; Meck & Williams, 1997a). Choline deprivation in rats leads to a 4- fold increase in the rate of neural tube defects (Shaw et al., 20 04). In 
addition, choline deficiency leads to permanent structural and biochemical brain abnormalities that may be related to underlying changes in neurogenesis and differentiation in fetal hippocampus and septum, areas of brain that are critical for norma l spatial learning and memory (Cermak et al., 1999). Furthermore, prenatal 
choline supplementation leads to enhanced visual -spatial memory performance (Meck 
et al., 1988, 1989; Meck & Williams, 1997a, 1997b) and reductions in proactive interference during learning (Meck & Williams,  1999).  
 
Perinatal choline levels have an impact at multiple levels of neurodevelopment. Choline 
contributes to increased dendritic arborization in hippocampal CA1 cells, larger somata, 
and critical functional changes to these cells (J. P. Jones et al., 1999; Li et al., 2004; Mellott et al., 2004; Montoya et al., 2000; Pyapali et al.,1998). Prenatal and postnatal choline supplementation also affects choline acetyltransferase levels in both hippocampus and frontal cortex in rats which, in turn, is associated with improved memory functioning, especially in visual -spatial memory (Meck et al., 1989; Williams et 
al., 1998). It has also been demonstrated that the ability of cholinergic neurons  to 
produce acetylcholine is directly related to the availability of free choline, its precursor (Blusztajn & Wurtman, 1983). Furthermore, choline levels have an impact throughout the brain on apoptosis, the programmed cell death that is part of normal brain development (Holmes -McNary et al., 1997; Yen et al., 2001). In addition, choline is 
required for the production of a number of phopholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (such as phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and plasmalogen) that are present in all cells including neurons. These membrane phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_136983], among other processes (Zeisel & Niculescu, 2006). Thus, the evidence suggests that the availability of free choline has important effects, depending on discrete time windows, on basic aspects of brain structure and function in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866] (J. P. Jones et al., 1999).  
 
Importantly, pre -clinical choline studies provide strong evidence that choline levels 
during critical periods of brain development have a permanent impact on brain structure and function throughout the lifespan. For example, electrophysiological studies of hippocampal CA1 cells in brain slices of adult rats that were either deprived of choline or supplemented with choline during gestation show permanent changes in long term 
potentiation (LTP) (J. P. Jones et al., 1999). LTP reflects an increase in strength of the synaptic connection between neurons following high frequency stimulation (Bliss & Gardner -Medwin, 1973; Bliss & Lomo, 1973) and is thought to be an important 
substrate of learning and memory (Bliss et al., 2003). Meck and colleagues have 
Page [ADDRESS_155576] of perinatal choline availability on brain structure as “metabolic 
imprinting” because of the permanent changes that occur in the cholinergic system, affecting brain functioning throughout the lifetime (Meck & Williams, 2003).  
 
Perinatal choline supplementation attenuates the negative effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Thomas et al. (2000) initially demonstrated that administering choline to prenatally -exposed rat pups on postnatal days 2- [ADDRESS_155577] room for improvement. In this study, as in others, the beneficial effects of choline on cognitive functioning continued (at least until postnatal day 45 when testing occurred) long after choline administration had been discontinued (post -natal day 21). A 
number of other studies have shown similar effects of postnatal choline improv ing 
cognitive functioning including visual -spatial learning, spatial reversal learning, and fear 
conditioning among rats prenatally exposed to alcohol (Wagner & Hunt, 2006). In addition, choline supplementation during postnatal days 4- 30 has also been show n to 
reduce excess activity of rats in an open- field situation (J. D. Thomas et al., 2004). This 
finding is intriguing because prenatal alcohol exposure causes postnatal hyperactivity in rats, and is associated with hyperactivity and inattention in humans with FASD.  
 
In normally developi[INVESTIGATOR_136984], the “window” for the beneficial effects of choline appears to include gestation and the first [ADDRESS_155578] significant benefits 
obtained if choline supplementation is given during both prenatal and postnatal periods 
(Meck et al., 1989). However, the critical windows for choline’s effectiveness may in fact 
be different for animals whose brains have been damaged by [CONTACT_137010]. Ryan et al. (2008) demonstrated that both “early” postnat al choline 
supplementation (postnatal days 11- 20) and “late” choline supplementation postnatal 
days 21- 30) significantly attenuated the cognitive deficits induced by [CONTACT_137011]. There was a slight advantage for the early supplementation, but  it was not a 
large difference. Thus, the authors concluded that “there is not a strict temporal window for choline to be effective, at least on some behavioral measures” and that “the developmental window for choline to be effective is either quite large,  or spans between 
the PD (postnatal days) 11- 20 and 21- 30 time  periods.”  
Overall, these results suggest that, in humans, choline supplementation could attenuate the negative effects of prenatal alcohol exposure across a relatively wide period of postnatal development, perhaps even across the first 5 to 10 years of life.  
 
Extrapolating from the pre- clinical trial findings of choline’s efficacy to potential 
applications in humans is challenging due in part to the problems of cross -species 
neurodevelopmental c omparisons. Thomas et al.’s studies in FASD (J. D. Thomas et 
al., 2007; J. D. Thomas et al., 2004; J. D. Thomas et al., 2000) and much of the pre-  
clinical work in “normally developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” animals has been done with rats (Meck et al., 1988, 1989; Meck & Willi ams, 1997a). Fortunately, there have been significant 
advances in our understanding of cross -species comparisons (Clancy et al., 2001;  
Page 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota. Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_137012]., 2007) and some have argued that the prenatal and early postnatal periods 
are the most reliable time period during the lifespan in which to make such comparisons 
because of the remarkable similarity in timing and order of critical neurodevelopmental events across species (Finlay & Darlington, 1995). This may be especially true with regard to specific neural systems or structures.  
 
As an example, we know a great deal about the timing and sequencing of hippocampal development in rats and humans (Avishai -Eliner et al., 2002). In humans, there is a 
rapid increase in hippocampal development during  the first two years of life, followed by 
a period of slow, steady growth until adolescence (Utsunomiya et al.,1999). Critical aspects of differentiation and synaptogenesis are occurring in the hippocampus between [ADDRESS_155579] by 21 postnatal days, within the timeframe of choline’s efficacy in pre- clinical studies.  
Similarly, in humans, hippocampal -dependent learning and memory processes continue 
to mature until 4 or 5 years of age. The equivalent developmental maturation of memory processes in the rat occurs on postnatal days 15 and 16, again within the timeframe of choline’s efficacy. MRI volumetric studies hav e now demonstrated that the human 
hippocampus undergoes a rapid growth spurt in the first two years of life and continues 
a slow, steady growth throughout childhood.  
 
The principal of clinical equipoise, describing the state of genuine uncertainty in the 
expert medical community about the potential efficacy of an intervention (Freedman, 
1987), is an important factor in decisions about the ethics and practicality of a randomized clinical trial. At the present time, despi[INVESTIGATOR_136985]- clinical evidence, 
there is very little human data and no consensus about the potential 
neurodevelopmental benefits of postnatal choline supplementation in humans (Cockburn, 2003). This uncertainty supports the need for a comprehensive trial.  
 
The ability of choline supplementation to modify certain aspects of brain development 
and mediate the effects of damage during development may prove useful in other 
neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, Holmes et al. (2002) have shown that prenatal choline supplementation of rats pr otects them from cognitive impairment 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_136986]- seizures at a point much later in development. This work, and 
other similar work on choline supplementation suggests that nutritional factors during critical periods of brain development (pren atal and postnatal) has long -lasting effects on 
neuroplasticity (Williams, 2008). Intriguingly, the effects of early supplementation appear to last throughout the lifetime of the organism. For example Glenn et al. (2008) found that prenatal choline supplem entation in rats on embryonic days 12- 17 led to less age-  
related decline in cognitive functioning (open field exploratory behavior) at 25 months (considered old age in rats). This life- long protective effect of choline was associated 
with increased number s of newly proliferated hippocampal cells as well as increased 
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and neurotrophin- [ADDRESS_155580] recently demonstrated sever al neurodevelopmental benefits 
of postnatal choline supplementation in a rat model of Rett Syndrome (Mecp2(1lox) 
mice) including improved locomotion (Nag & Berger -Sweeney, 2007) and increased 
striatal nerve growth factor (Nag et al., 2008).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_155581]. Steven Zeisel, Professor of Nutrition and Pediatrics at the University of North Carolina and director of the Nutrition Research Institute ( nri.unc.edu) and a consultant 
on this project, is one of the world’s leading nutrition experts. [CONTACT_137054] has been studying choline for more than [ADDRESS_155582] important findings including the studies initially demonstrating that choline is an essential nutrient in humans (Sheard & Zeisel, 1986; Zeisel et al., 1991). [CONTACT_137054]’s 
work has identified choline levels in common foods (Howe et al., 2004), identified 
genetic polymorphisms associated with choline metabolism (daCosta et al., 2006; 
Zeisel, 2007, 2008), and investigated relationships between choline and numerous  
human diseases (Albright et al., 1997; Bidulescu et al., 2007; Cho et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2008; Zeisel, 1992). Most relevant to the current proposal, [CONTACT_137054] has demonstrated the role of choline in normal brain development as well as the potential for choline supplementation during critical periods of brain development (Conlay & Zeisel, 1982; Magil et al., 1981; Sanders & Zeisel, 2007; Zeisel, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2009a; Zeisel & Niculescu, 2006).  
 
Our research group has recently completed the first pi[INVESTIGATOR_136987] a neurodevelopmental intervention in children with FASD. We first conducted a double-  blind, randomized, placebo- controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 
(R21AA019580) that focused on establishing the safety and tol erability of choline  
in children with FASD (n=20) (Wozniak, Fuglestad et al. 2013). That study evaluated the safety of choline (there were no serious adverse events) and demonstrated high tolerability (children received partial or full doses on 87% of 270 days in the study).  
We recently completed a larger double- blind, randomized, placebo controlled 
trial that included a total of 40 additional participants, ages 2.5 to 5 years  
(R33AA019580). Compared to placebo, choline supplementation improved 2- 3 year old  
children’s performance on an elicited imitation paradigm, a hippocampus -dependent 
memory task. These data are outlined in the preliminary studies section below. The results comprise the first available human evidence that the pre- clinical findings in 
rodents may translate to humans. The results from our initial two studies of choline in 
children with FASD directly inform the next phase of this work which will include 1.  
Testing a modified dosing scheme based on the efficacy and side effect data collected 
in the previous trials; 2. Determining the longevity of the cognitive changes attributable 
to choline; 3. Examining the specificity/generalizability of choline’s effects by [CONTACT_137013]; 4. Further evaluating a choline- specific gene as apotential

nucleotide polymorphism (SMP) that is involved in endogenous choline synthesis (phosphatidylethanolamine N -methyltransferase (PEMT) rs12325817 S NP). The SNP 
is associated with significantly greater susceptibility to dietary choline insufficiency (Fischer, da Costa et al. 2010). The hypothesis is that children with one or two alleles of rs12325817 (CG or CC genotype) will show a significantly larger response to choline treatment on measures of cognitive functioning compared to those with the normal genotype (GG) because they have a lower capacity to synthesize choline endogenously.  
 
A series of papers from a Cleveland Clinic research group have rais ed a potential link 
between trimethylamine- N-oxide or TMAO, a metabolite of choline and carnitine, and 
atherosclerosis in older adults with cardiovascular disease (Wang et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2013; Koeth et al., 2013). An initial metabolomic study of patients undergoing cardiac evaluation showed an association between plasma TMAO levels and acute cardiovascular events. A later study showed a similar relationship between plasma TMAO levels in patients undergoing coronary angiography and cardiovascular ev ents 
over a 3- year follow -up period. Another study reported that atherosclerosis -prone 
(APOE--) mice that were fed choline or TMAO showed greater aortic root 
atherosclerotic plaque compared to control animals. In contrast, a study in hamsters 
demonstrated an inverse relationship between plasma TMAO and atherosclerosis 
(Martin et al., 2009). Two large studies of cardiovascular risk factors in humans, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (14,430 men and women) study (Bidulescu et al., 2007) and the PROSPEC T-European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and 
Nutrition (16,165 women) study (Dalmeijer et al., 2008) observed no significant increase 
in cardiovascular risk with increasing dietary intake of choline. An editorial accompanying the Tang et al. (2013)  paper in the New England Journal of Medicine 
highlights the importance of further examining the new model but also cautions “These speculative comments and suggestive observations indicate that much remains to be done to determine the precise role of TMAO  in atherothrombogenesis — whether it has 
a direct effect on pathogenesis, is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_136988], or is a precursor to a more direct effector.” (Loscalzo at al., 2013). In summary, these emerging data are important but do not imply a clear risk to healthy youhg individuals taking choline supplementation. We have informed the FDA of these developments in the literature 
with an Administrative Supplement and we will continue to monitor TMAO levels in the trial in order to provide additional data to the field.  
 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
For children ages 1 to 3 years, the recommended dietary intake (RDI) for choline is 200 mg. and the maximum upper limit for tolerability is 1000 mg. (Food and Nutrition Board -  
Institute of Medicine, 1998). For chi ldren ages 4 to 8 years, the RDI for choline is 250 
mg. and the maximum upper limit for tolerability is also 1000 mg. (eating two eggs would provide an equivalent of 545 mg. of choline). The goal of the current study is to provide choline supplementation as opposed to simply ensuring choline sufficiency.  
Our previous two studies used a fixed 500 mg. dose, regardless of the child’s weight  
Page 9 
CONFIDENTIAL

(Wozniak et al. 2013, and Wozniak et al., 2015). The dose was well -tolerated, with 
partial or full doses received on 88% of the 270 days in the study. There was no 
difference between 500 mg. choline and placebo in terms of doses received or participant dro p-out. There were no serious adverse events and no adverse events that 
differed by [CONTACT_137015] (an expected adverse event). A substantial proportion of children in the choline group (52%) compared to the control gr oup (4%) did experience fishy body odor at some point in the [ADDRESS_155583] children in the study by [CONTACT_8497], nearly 100% experienced fishy body odor at some point.  
 
For the current study, choline will be given at a 19 mg per kg dose, based on evidence 
from the prior two pi[INVESTIGATOR_136989] 19 mg per kg range.  Choline will be administered in the form of a frui t-flavored drink 
mix containing choline bitartrate (compounded for the study by [CONTACT_137016], St. Paul, MN; Investigational New Drug Application #107085). Balchem (New Hampton, NY) manufactures the choline bitartrate to USP standards.  The parent will add the powder to plain water. The matching placebo drink mix (without choline bitartrate) will also be provided by [CONTACT_137016]. Material will be stored, labeled, allocated, and dispensed by [CONTACT_137017]’s Investigational Drug Service (IDS)  Pharmacy.  
 
Participant families will be given a [ADDRESS_155584] verified the participant’s continued 
involvement in the study and freedom from serious adverse events during telephone visits. The preparation, coding, and tracking will be handled by [CONTACT_137018]’s Investigational Drug Service pharmacy.  
 
Choline is considered a GRAS substance (generally regarded as safe) by [CONTACT_137019].  
Based on our previous study, tolerability for this lower dose of choline is expected to be 
high. Parents will be educated at the time of enrollment about potential side effects of choline which rarely occur and usually at much higher doses than those proposed (hypotension has been reported at 7.5 grams per day; gastrointestinal symptoms (loss of appetite, upset stomach), sweating, or body odor have occurred at 10- 16 grams per 
day). As indicated, in the first 60 participants, we only observed fishy body odor and not other adverse events.  
 
At one month, a full range of potential side effects will be screened. Although allergic reactions to choline are not expected (we observed none in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]), we will moni tor for a range of allergic symptoms nonetheless. Adverse events and serious 
adverse events will be reported to the University of Minnesota IRB and to Quorum IRB. 
Serious adverse events will also be reported to the NIH program officer.

took choline and placebo as part of the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
Evaluate the potential interaction between genotype ((for example PEMT, rs12325817) 
and response to choline intervention.  
 
3. Study  Design 
3.[ADDRESS_155585] acebo- controlled study. Sixty children, male and 
female, between the ages of 2 years and 5 years at enrollment will be included.  
 
Eligible participants will be randomized to treatment or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_155586] an in- person 
baseline visit followed by 11 additional visits (9 telephone visits; 2 additional in- person 
visits) for a total of [ADDRESS_155587], participants from the previous study (1R21AA019580 / 4R33AA019580) will be brought back to the University for a set of cognitive evaluations to assess the long -term effects of having taken choline/placebo previously.

3.3 Secondary Study  Endpoints  
Secondary cognitive endpoints will include the Minnesota Executive Functioning Scale 
(Carlson, 2014), and the NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Task (MacDonald, 2014). We will also evaluate potential behavioral and/or emotional 
changes with a caregiver -report paper and pencil measure (Child Behavior Checklist).  
 
We will also evaluate feasibility and tolerability by [CONTACT_137020]. Serum choline levels will be obtained.  
 
As part of the project, we will bring up to 40 participants (20 choline and 20 placebo) from our previous study (1R21AA019580 / 4R33AA019580) back to the University for a brief visit focused on examining the potential long -term cognitive effects of having taken 
choline or placebo. All who participated in the previous study will be eligible for the return visit. No study drug will be used at this visit and no blood will be collected. The measures administered wi ll be cognitive outcome measures. The Elicited Imitation 
paradigm, used in the initial study, will be repeated using materials/items that have not previously been seen by [CONTACT_2252]. The Stanford Binet Intelligence Scales will be administered. The NIH Toolbox Pi[INVESTIGATOR_136990] a measure of epi[INVESTIGATOR_136991] 3 and up (McDonald 2014). The NIH Dimensional Card Sort Task is a measure of executive functioning from the same NIH Toolbox. The NIH Flanker Task is a measure of attentional control from the same NIH toolbox. The Narrative Memory subtest from the NEPSY -II is a measure of verbal 
memory for ages 3 to 16 (Korkman, Kirk et al. 2007). The Memory for Names subtest is another verbal memory subtest from the NEPSY -II. The child’s height and weight will 
also be measured.  
 
We will also bring up to 20 participants (10 choline and 10 placebo) from our previous 
study (1R21AA019580 / 4R33AA019580) back to the University for a neuroimaging visit focused on examining the potential long -term brain development effects of having 
taken choline or placebo. Participants will undergo MRI scans and brief neurocognitive testing at this follow -up visit. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_155589] are below the upper tolerable limit for choline (1000 mg 
per day) and at or below the doses previously used in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] . At much higher 
doses than we are proposing, choline supplementation has been associated with mild 
hypotension. We observed no evidence of hypotension in [ADDRESS_155590] (DSMB) is in place and will review the 
study progress and adverse events.  
 
4. Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1. Ages 2.5 years to 5 years of  age* 
2. Available parent or legal guardian capable of giving informed consent for 
participation. Participation of children under guardianship (wards of the state) needs to be authorized by a court  order.  
3. Modified Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria for Fetal Alcohol  Syndrome (FAS), 
Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (PFAS), or Alcohol -Related Neurodevelopmental 
Disorder (ARND) (Hoyme, May, et al.,  2005).  
 
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
1. Known history of a neurological condition (ex. epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], traumatic brain injury)  
2. Known history of a medical condition known to affect brain function.  
3. Known history  of other  neurodevelopmental  disorder  (ex. autism,  Down 
syndrome)  
4. Known history of very low birthweight (<1500 grams)  
 
*For the follow -up studies of returning participants from the previous study 
(1R21AA019580 / 4R33AA019580), the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be the same as above except that the age range will be extended to incorporate the fact that the children are now older. The inclusion/exclusion criteria for the follow -up study wil l be 
from 2.[ADDRESS_155591] Recruitment and Screening  
Participants will be recruited from two University of Minnesota Medical Center Clinics in 
which co -investigators see patients: The Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders clinic ([CONTACT_137055], Ph.D., [CONTACT_137056], Ph.D) and the International Adoption Clinic 
(directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Judith Eckerle, M.D.). Families of potential participants will be 
contact[CONTACT_136501]. Visitors to these clinics may also see flyers and brochures describing the study at the time of their clinic appointment although they will not be 
recruited directly by [CONTACT_137021]. Mailings will also be sent to families of children with FASD via lists provided by [CONTACT_137022] (MOFA S). MOFAS has close working relationships with [CONTACT_137057], [CONTACT_137058], [CONTACT_137059], [CONTACT_137060] and both clinics. All recruitment materials will be submitted for IRB approval upon development, before use in the study. Telephone scripts will be utilized.  
 
For the follow -up assessment, all participants from the previous study (1R21AA019580 / 
4R33AA019580) will be invited to participate. Contact [CONTACT_137023]/or telephone 
call. Scripts will be utilized.  
Page [ADDRESS_155592] with the parent / primary caregiver. We will attempt to collect some follow -up information at 9 months for  
all withdrawn subjects (the normal point of study conclusion). If the withdrawn participant family is willing to be interviewed in person or by [CONTACT_137024], we will collect side effect information, other health information such as the emergence of new medical problems, behavioral data (via the standard study behavioral rating instruments), and information about the reasons for study  withdrawal.  
 
5. Study  Drug  
5.1 Description 
Choline, which is considered part of the Vitamin B -complex, is an essential nutrient 
normally consumed on a daily basis in many foods. Supplemental choline will be administered in the form of a fruit -flavored drink mix containing choline bitartrate 
(compounded for the study by [CONTACT_137016], St. Paul, MN under IND#107085). Balchem (New Hampton, NY) manufactures the choline bitartrate to USP standards. The parent will add the powder to plain water. The matching placebo drink mix (without choline bitartrate) will al so be provided by [CONTACT_137016]. Material will be stored, labeled, allocated, 
and dispensed by [CONTACT_137025]’s Investigational Drug Service (IDS) Pharmacy.  
 
5.2 Treatment  Regimen 
Choline will be administered at a dose of 19 mg per kg once daily, as an oral solution for 
nine months. Placebo will be administered as an oral solution once daily for nine 
months. Choline will be administered under FDA Investigational New Drug Application #107085. Parents will be informed that choline is being regulated as an i nvestigational 
drug for purposes of this clinical  trial. 
Page [ADDRESS_155593] article according to the randomization  schedule.  
 
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study  Drug 
Fagron will prepare the choline fortified fruit -flavored drink mix and placebo drink mix for 
the study (IND#107085). Participating families will be provided with a supply of the material in the form of individual packages. The parent / guardian will prepare the drink by [CONTACT_137026]. The parent/guardian will be trained to prepare and administer the test article at the time of the baseline visit . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_155594] Compliance  Monitoring  
The parent/guardian of each subject will be asked to keep all empty study packets in a provided Ziploc bag. Self -addressed, postage -paid large envelopes will be provided to 
participant families to facilitate the return of empty packets. At the time of Visit 8 and 
Visit 11, the parent/guardian will be asked to bring all used and unused packets of the test article. Study staff will count the used and unused packets. Information will be recorded on the compliance case report f orm for each follow -up visit.  
 
Significant non -compliance will be reported to the investigator after each follow -up visit. 
Compliance will be discussed and encouraged at each follow -up visit including 
telephone visits.  
 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant  Therapy  
At bas eline, and at every follow -up visit, the parent/guardian will be asked to provide 
information about any over -the-counter or prescription medications the subject is 
currently taking or has been given since the last visit. The parent/guardian will be asked to provide the name [CONTACT_137053], the dose, the starting date and the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107278].  
 
After enrollment, the new initiation of nutritional supplements containing choline or betaine will be disallowed. All other concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including potential behavioral interventions, will be allowed and recorded.

 • De-identified neuroimaging data will be stored locally on servers supported by [CONTACT_137031]  (CMRR).  
• De-identified cognitive and behavioral data will be stored in a secure,  HIPAA-  
compliant RedCap database supported by [CONTACT_137025].  
• Data elements to be stored will include processed, de- identified neuroimaging 
results, de -identified neurocognitive test results, and de- identified behavioral 
questionnaire data.  
 
NOTE: If a participant has recently participated in one of our other protocols, and 
there is recent appropriate MRI or neuropsychological data, signed permission will be obtained to utilize those data for the purposes of this protocol (in addition to the standard consent and assent forms for this study).  
 
NOTE: Missing data for cognitive measures in studies of children with 
neurodevelopmental disorders are common (because of attention deficits, non-  
compliance, etc.). Behavioral checklists are always presented with the option to skip 
items if they are uncomfortable. Therefore, missing cognitive test data and behavioral checklist data are within protocol and not considered deviations.  
 
7. Statistical Plan  
7.[ADDRESS_155601] items on delayed recall of the EI task (averaged across two events per timepoint). The effect size from our completed trial was d=0.66. A power analysis was carried  out using Optimal Design Software for Multi -level and Longitudinal Research 
(Version 3.01) to determine the sample size that would be necessary to detect a difference in linear change between treatment and placebo groups with this effect size (Feingold 2009). The analysis assumed that the data would be analyzed using a mixed models repeated measures design for a person- randomized trial, with an effect size 
d=.66, and a two- tailed type I error of 0.05. To achieve 80% power, a sample size of  
58.5 participant s (approximately 30 per treatment arm) is necessary. This is consistent 
with the significant group difference that was observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. The sample size for the proposed study will therefore be fixed at [ADDRESS_155602] set of pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (N=60) and the proposed 
study (N=60) will provide additional power to further evaluate age, sex, and PEMT genotype as moderating variables.  
 
7.2 Statistical  Methods  
Statistical anal yses will utilize an Intention to Treat (ITT) approach. Mixed models 
analyses with growth curve estimates will form the basis of the core analyses.

8. Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse  Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are consi dered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study  withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic  tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_137032]  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse  Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious. A serious adverse event is 
any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836] 
• results in persistent or signifi cant disability or  incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical  event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject,  and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, 
drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department woul d typi[INVESTIGATOR_48517].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as  
non- serious adverse events.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_155604] be reported is normally defined as 
the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up (10 months in the case of this study).  
8.1.4 Preexisting  Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
8.1.5 General Physical Examination  Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_155605] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
 
8.1.7 Abnormal Laboratory  Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality will be documented as an adverse event if any one of  
the following  conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm 
the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of 
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation,  etc. 
 
8.1.8 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136994] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for surgery will be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5110] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was  uneventful.

• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5111].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136995], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136996].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_155606] with the participant family, the investigator will seek information about 
adverse events through specific questioning. At each in-person visit, the investigators 
will also directly evaluate for adverse events by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF). Clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded. The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any seri ous adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse  Events 
8.3.1 Study Sponsor Notification by  [CONTACT_10670]  
A serious adverse event will be reported to the IRB and to the study sponsor (NIH) by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of the event. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by [CONTACT_137033] 24 hours. The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.

8.3.3 FDA Notification by  [CONTACT_137034] -threatening experience associated with the use of the drug as 
soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the sponsor’s original receipt of the information.  
 
If a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit 
the criteria for reporting, the study sponsor will submit the adverse event in a written report to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_155608] the Investigational 
Drug  Service (IDS) within [ADDRESS_155609]. This will be 
reported in the case report form. A written narrative of the events will be prepared within 48 hours.  
 
8.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136997] a local DSMB. Based on the previous study experience, the investigational drug involved (choline), and the goals of the study, there will not be formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136998]. If a statistically significant group difference in serious side effects is  identified by [CONTACT_4318], the study will be stopped.  
 
8.6 Medical  Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site. This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate report ing of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and 
implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 9 Auditing, 
Monitoring and Inspecting). Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.

9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Source data are contained in source documents. Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at  the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments involved in the 
clinical trial. 
 
Data generated by [CONTACT_17254]' medical records and/or study progress notes. Data may be transcribed legibly on CRFs supplied for each subject or directly inputted into an electronic system or any 
combination thereof.  
 
9.3 Case Report  Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All data requested on the CRF must be recorded. All missing data must be explained.  
If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”. If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”. All entries should be printe d legibly in black ink. If any entry error has been 
made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it. All such changes must be initialed and dated. DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain 
entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it. 
 
Source documents will serve as case report forms for all test article and behavioral survey forms completed by [CONTACT_748]’ parent/guardian and for all of the standardized FASD and neurodevelopment tests implemented as a part of this research.  
 
9.4 Records Retention 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_155613]. These doc uments should be retained for a longer period if 
required by [CONTACT_16477]. In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

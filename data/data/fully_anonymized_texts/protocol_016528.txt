2PRÉCIS
Background:
Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608607].
Women reported experiencing an increased incidence of adverse effects than men, 
resulting in a reduction of the recommended dose of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608608].
Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608609]; the recommended dose for the 
elderly and female populations is 5mg daily.
Subsequent studies have shown that women experience greater exposure to zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608610], potentially due to androgen-driven differences in enzyme expression. 
A preclinical study showed that castrated male rats exhibited zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608611], providing further evidence to suggest that zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608612]-driven. 
Objectives:
To evaluate the effect of castration on the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg dose of 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608613] 
(pre- vs. post-castration therapy) compared to normal healthy females.
Eligibility:
Participants with prostate cancer (rising PSA and testosterone levels ≥ 100 ng/dL)
Females in good health condition or without significant diseases
After androgen deprivation therapy, castrate testosterone levels <50 ng/dL 
ECOG 0-1 
Design:
Comparative, single-dose pharmacokinetic study.
Men with prostate cancer  (pre-castration) and normal healthy females will receive 
treatment with a single dose of 5 mg tablet of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608614] 8-hour 
pharmacokinetic evaluation of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608615].
Men will then undergo androgen deprivation therapy and when castrate testosterone 
levels <50 ng/dL (post-castration), they will receive another 5 mg single dose of 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608614] 8-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608616].
Normal healthy females will receive treatment with a single dose of 5 mg tablet of 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608614] 8-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608616].

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 STUDY O BJECTIVES
1.1.1 Primary Objective
To evaluate the effect of castration on the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg dose of 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608618] (pre- vs. post-castration therapy) and 
to the exposure of normal healthy females.
1.[ADDRESS_806922] of the 
GABAA receptor to induce sleep. It displays high specificity for the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-1 receptor 
subtype over others. Receptor binding of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608619]. It has a short clearance time making it beneficial for patients with difficulty falling asleep 
[1]. Insomnia is a common problem for many and recently zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608620]. 
However, some patients maintain the effects of the drug for long durations, mainly drowsiness 
upon waking the following morning. This can impair one’s ability to perform necessary tasks or 
operate motor vehicles effectively [2]. With women and the elderly reporting higher incidences of 
insomnia, research has moved towards investigating the pharmacokinetic properties of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608621] [3, 4].
1.2.[ADDRESS_806923] reported a higher incidence of persisting adverse effects from zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608622]. 
Subsequent studies analyzed the pharmacokinetics properties of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608623]. 
Abbreviated Title: Castration on Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608606]: 02/08/2022
6In one study of healthy non-elderly individuals, females consistently experienced 40-50% higher 
AUC values (280 ng*h/mL vs 187 ng*h/mL) and a higher C MAX (77 ng/mL vs 53 ng/mL) as seen 
in Figure 1[5]. This suggested slower clearance than males across several dosage levels. Such 
results led the FDA to decrease the recommended dose for female by [CONTACT_608694] 2013. The current 
FDA recommended dose is [ADDRESS_806924] influential enzyme is CYP3A4, which is responsible for about 60% of CYP-mediated 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608624]. These metabolites are then converted to aldehydes by [CONTACT_608695] (ADHs). The aldehyde is then converted to a carboxylic acid by [CONTACT_608696] (ALDHs). The two main zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608625] 
4-carboxylic acid (ZPCA) and zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] 6-carboxylic acid (ZCA) which constitute about 72-86% 
and 10% of the original dose, respectively [6]. Previously mentioned sex-specific differences could 
not be ascribed to CYP3A4, as females have greater CYP3A4 activity than men [7]. However, 
males express more ADH and ALDH in the gastrointestinal tract than females [8-12]. 
A comparison of elderly and young men revealed drastic changes in pharmacokinetics. Compared 
to young men, elderly men recorded vastly decreased oral clearance (276 mL/min vs 820 mL/min) 
as well as higher C MAX (93 ng/mL vs 40 ng/mL), AUC (400 ng*h/mL vs 110 ng*h/mL), and a 
longer half-life (2.7 h vs 1.5 h). The same analysis in women also revealed an increased AUC (398 
ng*h/mL vs 249 ng*h/mL) and decreased clearance (209 mL/min vs 376 mL/min) with age but to 
a far lesser degree. Further analysis showed that elderly men posted values closer to that of women 
than younger men. This might be explained by [CONTACT_608697], which were 
found to be lower in elderly than younger men (10.5 pg/mL vs 19.0 pg/mL). When compared to

Abbreviated Title: Castration on Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608606]: 02/08/[ADDRESS_806925] revealed sex differences affecting zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608629]. 
Females were found to experience greater exposure to the drug resulting in an increased incidence 
of adverse effects. One study attributed these differences to a discrepancy in zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608630] [5]. This led to a revision to dosing protocols where females and elderly receive 
half the dose of males. However, a subsequent preclinical study suggested that these differences 
may be androgen-driven and be caused by a difference in absorption [14]. This clinical study will 
provide a unique opportunity to observe the effects of castration on zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608631]. The findings could lend more evidence that sex differences in zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608632]-pass metabolism and absorption more than clearance.
Subjects of Asian descent often have a lack of alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzyme activity in the 
stomach tissue [15, 16], express atypi[INVESTIGATOR_608633]2*2 that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_608634] 
[17], and harbor the E487K polymorphism in ALDH2 that inactivates the conversion of aldehydes 
into carboxylates [18]. Thus, these individuals often have altered alcohol disposition as compared 
to other world populations. Since we observed that ADH and ALDH affect zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608635] a function of plasma androgen, Asians will be excluded from this study.

of a single 5-mg dose of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608640] (cohort 1, arm 1) 
undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (pre- vs. post-castration therapy) compared to normal 
healthy females (cohort 2, arm 2). In men with prostate cancer, males (pre-castration, n=10) will 
receive oral zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608641] a [ADDRESS_806931]-dose. This 
cohort of men will then undergo androgen deprivation therapy until castrate testosterone levels 
reach <50 ng/dL. When castrate testosterone levels reach <50 ng/dL (post-castration), they will 
receive another 5 mg single dose of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608614] 8-hr PK evaluation (as described 
above for pre-castrate men) of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608615].
Normal healthy females (n=10) will receive a single dose of [ADDRESS_806932]-dose.
3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
The rate and extent of absorption of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608642]. For 
orally administered immediate-release and controlled‐ release zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], coadministration with a 
standard high‐fat meal slows the rate of absorption and reduces the extent of absorption. These 
findings are described in the product label, but are not published in the literature. The effect of 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608643] a meal. In a food effect study on 
the rate and extent of absorption of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608644] a standard 3.[ADDRESS_806933]‐dose. Beyond [ADDRESS_806934]‐dose, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608645], but net total AUC was not significantly different between the 
conditions [19]. Therefore, we recommend that participants should fast (no caloric intake) for at 
least 4 hours prior to being administered the dose of the study medication.

Participants may be on concomitant drugs to prevent bone loss, including calcium, vitamin D, 
bisphosphonates and denosumab.
Other supportive care with blood components, antibiotics, analgesics, general medical therapy, 
etc., will be delivered as required.
4.1 GENERAL GUIDELINES
All medications (other than study drug) and significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical 
therapy and blood transfusions) taken within 28 days before starting study treatment through the 
final follow up phone call should be reported on the CRF.
While participants are on protocol treatment, all medications required for the health of the 
participant are allowed with the following exceptions :
Concurrent chemotherapy 
Concurrent radiation therapy 
Concurrent immunotherapy 
Concurrent anti-cancer radionuclides 
Concurrent systemic corticosteroid use (daily or every other day for continued use > 14 
days)
Concomitant use of secondary hormonal treatments
Concomitant use of herbal supplements
Concomitant use of medications mentioned in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].
4.2 CNS  DEPRESSANTS 
Co-administration of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608649]. Concomitant use of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608650], including impaired driving ability. Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608651]: Castration on Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608606]: 02/08/2022
20evaluated in healthy volunteers in single-dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs. 
Imipramine in combination with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608652] a 20% decrease in peak levels of imipramine, but there was an additive effect of 
decreased alertness. Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608653], but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness 
and psychomotor performance.
An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608654].
Concomitant administration of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608655].
After multiple doses of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608656]-
life (17%) was observed and should be avoided. There was no evidence of an additive 
effect in psychomotor performance.
4.3 DRUGS AFFECTING CYTOCHROME P450   
Some compounds known to induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect exposure to zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]. 
The effect of drugs that induce or inhibit other P450 enzymes on the exposure to 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608657].
Rifampin, a CYP3A4 inducer, significantly reduced the exposure to and the 
pharmacodynamic effects of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]. Use of CYP3A4 inducers in combination with 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608658]. Co-administration of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608659]3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, 
rifampin, rifapentine) may decrease the plasma exposure of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608660]. Selection of a concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4 
induction potential is recommended. 
Ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the exposure to zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608661]. 
Concomitant use of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608662]3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus), should be avoided, as zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608663]. 
Moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) 
and St. John’s Wort may also reduce the plasma exposure of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608664]. 
Grapefruit, Seville oranges, and starfruit affect P450 and PgP activity. Concomitant use 
should be avoided.

258 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES
Primary efficacy endpoints: 
In male participants, AUC after completing androgen deprivation therapy compared to AUC 
prior to receiving androgen deprivation therapy.
Secondary Efficacy endpoints:
AUC in females compared to males after receiving androgen deprivation therapy, to establish the 
approximate equivalence of the two groups with respect to this endpoint.
8.[ADDRESS_806949] the AUC determined. With 10 evaluable 
participants, there would be 80% power to detect the difference in the two measurements with an 
effect size of 1.0 (1.[ADDRESS_806950]) 
using a paired t-test with a 0.[ADDRESS_806951] to this endpoint. Assuming AUC values on the order of 200 ug*h/mL, it is 
considered that if AUC for post-ADT males is not less than 30-40 ug*h/mL below that of females, 
that this would be bioequivalent. When there are [ADDRESS_806952] 81% power to reject the null hypothesis that the AUCs from males 
and females are not equivalent (the difference in means, m male – m female, is 40 or farther from zero, 
assuming that the female values would be higher) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the 
means of the two groups are equivalent, if the expected difference in means is 10 ug*h/mL and the 
common standard deviation is 30 ug*h/mL. 
Evaluable subject is defined as the one who completes all parts of the study. Subjects who drop 
out of the study will be replaced. To account for possible dropouts and screen failures, the 
accrual ceiling for each arm will be set at 15 for a total accrual ceiling of 30 participants. 
8.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSIS
Modified intention to treat. Only participants who receive full dose administrations of the agents 
(two doses for males; one dose for females) will be included.
8.[ADDRESS_806953] approximately equivalent.
Abbreviated Title: Castration on Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608606]: 02/08/[ADDRESS_806954] if the paired differences are not normally distributed.  The 
mean or median of the differences and a 95% confidence interval on the difference will be 
reported.
8.4.[ADDRESS_806955] approximately equivalent. A one-sided 90% confidence interval on the 
difference between the mean of the values of post-ADT males and healthy females will be 
constructed and interpreted in order to assess whether the two groups have approximately 
equivalent AUC values.
8.4.[ADDRESS_806956] deviations, medians, interquartile ranges, etc. may be determined. PK 
parameters may be compared between the males and females using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. 
Other tests to evaluate the trends or differences in values obtained may be undertaken for 
exploratory purposes.  
Abbreviated Title: Castration on Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608606]: 02/08/[ADDRESS_806957] SELECTION
9.1.1 Selection Based on Ethnicity, and Race
Subjects from all racial/ethnic groups, except Asians (see Section 1.2.3 for exclusion rationale), 
are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria. Efforts will be made to extend 
accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck 
between participant safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed 
to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on one hand and the need to explore ethnic 
aspects of clinical research on the other hand. If differences in outcome that correlate with ethnic 
identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a follow-up study may be written to investigate 
those differences more fully. Women are eligible for this protocol as participants in the healthy 
female cohort.
9.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN

injury as a result of the participation in this study, immediate medical treatment is available at 
the Clinical Center, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland. Any injury will be evaluated 
and treated in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_608667].
9.4.3 Provisions for Monitoring Data Collection to Ensure Safety of Subjects
As information is gathered from this trial, clinical results will be shared with participants as they 
become available. Laboratory and clinical data will be frequently gathered and any new 
Abbreviated Title: Castration on Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608606]: 02/08/2022
28significant finding(s) found during the course of the research, which may affect a participant’s 
willingness to participate further, will be explained. Confidentiality of information concerning 
participants will be maintained, including in all publications and presentations results from this 
study. Names of participants and/or material identifying participants will not be released without 
permission, except as such release is required by [CONTACT_2371]. Records at the National Cancer Institute 
are maintained according to current legal requirements, and are made available for review, as 
required by [CONTACT_345085], only under the 
guidelines established by [CONTACT_33842].
9.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
The risks of blood draw are relatively small. In addition, the drug (5 mg of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]) being used 
in this study has been approved by [CONTACT_608704]-term treatment of insomnia

employment or position at NIH. Staff will be expected to comply with policy 2300-630-3, Leave 
Policy for NIH Employees Participating in Medical Research Studies.
Every effort will be made to protect participant information, but such information may be 
available in medical records and may be available to authorized users outside of the study team 
in both an identifiable an unidentifiable manner.
The NIH FAQs for NIH Staff Who are Considering Participation in NIH Research found in 
policy 404 – Research Involving NIH Staff will be made available. Please see Section 9.7.2 for 
consent of NIH Staff.
9.7 CONSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant for review prior to consenting. A designated study investigator will carefully explain 
the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the associated risks, discomforts and benefits. 
In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time as is needed to review the document will 
be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with friends, family members and/or other 
advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study investigator. A signed informed consent 
document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  Whether in person or remote, the privacy 
of the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, 
when in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is 
conducted remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of the private nature of 
the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.  
Abbreviated Title: Castration on Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608606]: 02/08/2022
29Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or as described below, with a manual 
(non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_62579].  When required, witness signature [CONTACT_62580].
Manual (non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_62581]:
When a manual signature [CONTACT_151247], this study will use the following to obtain the required signatures:
Adobe platform (which is not 21 CFR Part 11 compliant); or,  
iMedConsent platform (which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant)
During the consent process, participants and investigators will view individual copi[INVESTIGATOR_62496] (if remote consent); the 
same screen may be used when in the same location but is not required.  
Both the investigator and the participant will sign the document using a finger, stylus or mouse. 
Note: Refer to the CCR SOP PM-2, Obtaining and Documenting the Informed Consent Process 
for additional information (e.g., verification of participant identity when obtaining consent 
remotely) found here.
9.7.[ADDRESS_806961] the rights and welfare of the subjects given that the 
activities are only intended to determine suitability for screening for participation in research 
protocols. These activities could not practicably be carried out without the wavier as central 
recruiting services, utilized in the NIH Clinical Center, perform pre-screening activities for 
multiple studies and obtaining consent for each one is beyond their resources. The subjects will 
be provided with additional pertinent information after participation as they will be informed 
whether or not they are eligible to sign a consent for additional screening.
9.7.2 Consent for NIH Staff
Consent for NIH staff will be obtained as detailed in Section 9.6 with following additional 
protections:
Consent from staff members will be obtained by [CONTACT_165111]’s 
team whenever possible. In addition, if the participant is in a subordinate relationship with an 
investigator on the research team or is part of the work unit where the research is taking place, 
the consent procedure will be independently monitored by [CONTACT_608706].

3211.1.2 Toxicity 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CNS Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment
Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], like other sedative-hypnotic drugs, has central nervous system (CNS) depressant 
effects. Co-administration with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], tricyclic 
antidepressants, alcohol) increases the risk of CNS depression. Dosage adjustments of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608669]. The use of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608670]-hypnotics (including other zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608671]) at bedtime or the middle of the night is 
not recommended.
The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment, including impaired driving, is increased if 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608672] a full night of sleep remaining (7 to 8 hours); if a higher than the 
recommended dose is taken; if co-administered with other CNS depressants or alcohol; or if co-
administered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]. Participants should be 
warned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608673].
Vehicle drivers and machine operators should be warned that, as with other hypnotics, there may 
be a possible risk of adverse reactions including drowsiness, prolonged reaction time, dizziness, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], blurred/double vision, reduced alertness and impaired driving the morning after 
therapy. In order to minimize this risk a full night of sleep (7-8 hours) is recommended.
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions
Cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after 
taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]. Some patients 
have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing or nausea and vomiting that 
suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. 
If angioedema involves the throat, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. 
Participants who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608674].
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes
Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with 
sedative/hypnotics, including zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]. Some of these changes included decreased inhibition 
(e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), bizarre behavior, agitation 
and depersonalization. Visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported.
In controlled trials of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] 10 mg taken at bedtime < 1% of adults with insomnia reported 
hallucinations. In a clinical trial, 7% of pediatric patients treated with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] 0.25 mg/kg taken 
at bedtime reported hallucinations versus 0% treated with placebo.
Complex behaviors such as “sleep-driving” (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of 
a sedative-hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported in sedative-hypnotic-naive 
as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as “sleep-driving” 
have occurred with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608675], the co-administration of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608676], as does the use of 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608677]. Due to the risk to the participant 
Abbreviated Title: Castration on Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608606]: 02/08/2022
33and the community, discontinuation of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608678] a “sleep-driving” epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].
Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) 
have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with 
“sleep-driving”, patients usually do not remember these events. Amnesia, anxiety and other 
neuro-psychiatric symptoms may also occur.
It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal 
behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying 
psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or 
symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal Effects
There have been reports of withdrawal signs and symptoms following the rapid dose decrease or 
abrupt discontinuation of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]. Monitor participants for tolerance, abuse, and dependence

premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. Reactions 
most commonly associated with discontinuation from U.S. trials were daytime drowsiness 
(0.5%), dizziness (0.4%), headache (0.5%), nausea (0.6%), and vomiting (0.5%).
Approximately 4% of 1,959 patients who received zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608679] (1 to 50 mg) in similar 
foreign trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. Reactions most commonly 
associated with discontinuation from these trials were daytime drowsiness (1.1%), 
dizziness/vertigo (0.8%), amnesia (0.5%), nausea (0.5%), headache (0.4%), and falls (0.4%).
Data from a clinical study in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-treated patients 
were given zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_608680]-blind 
treatment with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (n=95) were associated with impaired concentration, continuing or 
aggravated depression, and manic reaction; one patient treated with placebo (n =97) was 
discontinued after an attempted suicide.

Provide background  on unanswered question(s) the study is attempting to answer (do not exceed one page)
While it is well-established that alterations  in the portal  vein insulin/glucagon ratio play a major role in 
causing dysregulated  hepatic glucose  metabolism in type 2 diabetes  (T2D), the cellular  and 
molecular mechanisms by [CONTACT_229272]. This is borne out by [CONTACT_229273] T2D, with unclear mechanisms of 
action. 
Glucagon has long been  considered to be one of the major drivers of hyperglycemia in T2D, and 
glucagon-blocking therapi[INVESTIGATOR_229263] [ADDRESS_275889] been  raised regarding  the potential of these 
agents to increase liver enzymes  by [CONTACT_229274].  Conversely, a dual glucagon-like 
peptide-1/glucagon receptor agonist has recently been shown in rodents and non-human primates to 
lower blood glucose concentrations, associated  with increased energy  expenditure and weight loss. 
Taken together, these  data suggest  a potential  role for glucagon to promote  hepatic mitochondrial fat 
oxidation and suggest that a lack of glucagon action may suppress hepatic fat oxidation and 
predispose to ectopic  hepatic lipid accumulation  and non alcoholic fatty liver disease  (NAFLD).  
 
The impact  of glucagon on hepatic  mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in humans is unknown but 
previous studies have suggested  a capacity for glucagon to increase liver fatty acid metabolism in 
vitro, and to stimulate hepatic fat oxidation  in awake  dogs. As predicted by [CONTACT_229275], multiple 
investigators have observed increases in CO 2 generation, O2 consumption,  and activity  of the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_229264], consistent with increased 
mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux; however, the mechanism by [CONTACT_229276]. In addition  we will assess the effects of a physiological increase  in plasma glucagon 
concentrations on rates of hepatic ketogenesis assessed by [CONTACT_60801] 13C4 OHB (Perry  et al. 
Cell Metabolism 2017). We have recently shown that allosteric  regulation  of pyruvate carboxylase 
by [CONTACT_229277]-CoA is a key mechanism by [CONTACT_229278] (Perry et al. Cell 2015) and 
glucagon (unpublished  results) regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis  and that rates of OHB turnover 
are an excellent non invasive surrogate  for hepatic acetyl-CoA content (Perry et al. Cell Metabolism 
2017).
This proposal will directly assess  the effect  of glucagon on rates of hepatic mitochondrial  oxidation 
and pyruvate carboxylase flux in humans  for the first time using Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer 
Analysis (PI[INVESTIGATOR_229262]) (Perry et al. Nature Communications 2017). The results of these studies have 
important implications for the possibility  of intervening in the pathogenesis  of NAFLD-associated 
hepatic insulin resistance and T2D via chronic dual glucagon-like peptide-1/glucagon receptor 
agonism and provide  an important rationale for why a dual agonist might be more efficacious for 
treating NAFLD/NASH/T2D than GLP-1 alone .

Effective Date: 25 April 2013     Page 3 of 6Objectives
List the objectives  to correspond directly with the listed hypotheses:
To examine the effects of glucagon on hepatic glucose and fat metabolism in vivo, we plan to apply a 
novel Positional  Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PI[INVESTIGATOR_229262])  method to quantify  rates of hepatic 
mitochondrial oxidation  (VCS) and pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC), which has been cross-validated in 
awake rodents  and humans (Perry et al. Nature Communications 2017). In preliminary rodent 
studies we have  found that glucagon stimulates  intrahepatic lipolysis through an InsP 3R-I-dependent 
process, leading to increases in hepatic  acetyl-CoA content, which allosterically activates pyruvate 
carboxylase activity  and flux (VPC), and that this phenomenon  explains  its acute, transcription-
independent effect to acutely stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis  in vivo (unpublished results). In 
addition, using PI[INVESTIGATOR_229265] 
(Vcs) through  InsP 3R-I-mediated  calcium signaling in awake  mice, and that this process can be 
exploited by [CONTACT_69506]-term continuous glucagon treatment leading  to two-fold increases in hepatic 
mitochondrial fat oxidation (VFAO), which  in turn results in large reductions in hepatic steatosis and 
marked improvements  in glucose  tolerance through reversal of hepatic insulin resistance in a high fat 
fed rat model  of NAFLD.
Hypothesis 
List the clinical Hypotheses in order of priority:
1.A physiological increase in plasma  glucagon concentrations will promote a significant increase 
in rates  of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation (VCS) in healthy humans.
2.A physiological increase in plasma  glucagon concentrations will promote a significant increase 
in rates  of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase  flux (VPC) in healthy humans.
3.A physiological increase in plasma  glucagon concentrations will promote a significant increase 
in rates  of 13C4 -OHB turnover (hepatic ketogenesis) in healthy humans.
Study Design/Clinical Plan
Provide a concise overview stating the type of experimental design
The effects of a physiological increase  in plasma glucagon  on rates of hepatic mitochondrial 
oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase flux will be examined in 12 healthy  subjects (ages 21-65) using 
Positional Isotopomer  NMR Tracer Analysis (PI[INVESTIGATOR_229262])  (Perry et al. Nature Communication 2017). 
Briefly rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation  (VCS) and hepatic pyruvate carboxylase  flux (VPC) will 
be assessed in 12 healthy  overnight fasted subjects by [CONTACT_976][INVESTIGATOR_229266] a three-hour  infusion of glucagon 
or saline. The glucagon  infusion [3 ng/(kg-min)] will be designed to increase peripheral and portal 
vein plasma  glucagon concentrations 3-4 fold. The effects of a physiological increase in plasma 
glucagon on rates of hepatic ketogenesis will also be assessed  using  an infusion of 13C4 OHB  
(Perry et al. Cell Metabolism  2017).  
Rates of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux  (VPC)/citrate synthase flux  (VCS)  by  [CONTACT_976][INVESTIGATOR_229262]: 
Subjects (n=12) will be studied by [CONTACT_976][INVESTIGATOR_229267] 2 conditions: 1) at 0700 following an overnight 
(12h) fast and a 3h saline infusion (Control), 2) at 0700 following an overnight (12h) fast and a 3h 
glucagon infusion @ [3 ng/(kg-min) ]  (Glucagon Rx). Briefly, on the morning of the study an IV line 
will be inserted into an antecubital vein for infusions and second IV line will be inserted 
retrogradely into a hand vein for blood collections. The hand will be warmed in a ‘hot box’ 
to arterialize the blood. After  collection of baseline blood samples a 3h infusion of tracers as 
described below will be started. Relative rates  of VPC/VCS  will be assessed  using  a constant

approved  the Yale Human  Investigation  Committee  (#[ZIP_CODE]).
GC/MS  Method   for  Quantifying [13C4]β OHB  turnover:  Analysis  of  the 13C- enrichment  in  
β OHB  will  be performed by [CONTACT_27199]-MS. Samples (100 μL plasma) will be dried under N2  gas and 
derivatized with 200 μL n- butanol 4N HCl, then heated for 60 min at 65°C and dried under N2 
gas. The samples will next be reacted with100  μL  of  trifluoroacetic  acid  (Thermo  Fisher  
Scientific)-methylene   chloride  (Sigma)  (1:7).  [13C4]βOHB enrichment will be measured by [CONTACT_27199]-

Treatment
List the clinical dosage/dosage form, route, and dose regimen:
Glucagon will be infused intravenously at rate of 3 ng/(kg-min) for three  hours.
Collateral Research 
Include  biomarkers,  PK, etc. 
Plasma samples will be collected  at the end of each  infusion study and banked for future 
metabolomic analyses to determine if any plasma metabolites track with glucagon-stimulated rates of 
hepatic mitochondrial  oxidation and/or pyruvate carboxylase flux. 
Statistical Plans
Include  justification for clinical sample size and primary hypothesis testing:
A group size of [ADDRESS_275890] a moderate  to 
large difference in the effects of glucagon on rates of hepatic  mitochondrial oxidation (VCS). The key 
endpoints will be to determine  if glucagon treatment results  in significant differences in: 1) rates of 
hepatic mitochondrial  oxidation, 2) rates  of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux (VPC), 3) rates  of 
hepatic glucose production, and 4) rates  of hepatic OHB turnover.  Statistical differences  in these

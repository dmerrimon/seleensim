1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 STUDY RATIONALE
Total knee arthroplasties are a common procedure in the [LOCATION_002] (US), designed to relieve 
pain and improve the quality of life in patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis. Age and obesity 
are major risk factors for osteoarthritis and as the US population continues to age and body mass 
index (BMI) levels increase, the incidence of total knee arthroplasties will increase as well. In 
2013, total knee arthroplasties were occurring at a rate of greater than 500,000 procedures per 
Year and are expected to increase to 3.48 million by 2030.2 Costs for total knee arthroplasties
currently exceed $[ADDRESS_299991] indicated long term outcome improvements in clinical performance and survivorship.6• 7• 8•

total joint arthroplasty. Mont et al. studied 400 procedures using single-use instruments for total 
knee arthroplasty, concluding that single-use instruments showed promising benefits and after 
further study, could play a role in increasing operating room efficiency.2 Siegel et al. found that 
total operating room time during total knee arthroplasty was on average 30 minutes shorter for 
single-use instruments and saved between $480 and $600 per case.3 The same study also 
suggested that single-use instru mentation may also decrease the risk of infection. 
There is controversy regarding some manufacturers' claims of improved clinical outcomes, 
surgical efficiency and decreased costs with patient-specific cutting blocks.[ADDRESS_299993]

1.2 STUDY TREATMENT 
MyKnee® patient-specific cutting blocks allow the surgeon to realize his pre-operative [ADDRESS_299994] images of the patient's knee. The blocks are created based on the 
individual patient's anatomy, his/her mechanical axis, and the surgeon's preferred reconstruction 
goals. The innovative concept combines the following features giving potential benefits to both 
the surgeon and the patient: 
•Accurate bony cuts and therefore implant positioning
•No intramedullary canal violation
•Up to 60% reduction of surgical steps for bone resection and related time
•Up to 66% reduction of time and cost in washing, assembling and sterilization procedures
•Interactive 30 web planning
The GMK single-use (Efficiency) instruments are made of medical-grade composite 
technopolymers that give high fatigue and abrasion resistance in addition to form versatility. The 
single-use instruments are shipped from the manufacturer in pre-sterilized packaging, eliminating 
the need to use the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172306]-Sterile processing equipment. The reproducible sterility may 
potentially reduce the infection risk.

2 STUDY DESIGN 
The study is a prospective, randomized study comparing surgical and economic parameters of 
Total Knee Arthroplasty performed using two different patient specific surgical techniques: 
Medacta MyKnee® surgical technique using Efficiency single use instruments versus Stryker 
Navigation surgical technique performed with conventional metal instruments. The objective is to 
compare the impact of two different patient specific surgical techniques and instrumentation in 
reducing overall surgical costs and improving mechanical axis alignment in Total Knee 
Arthroplasty. The timing of routine surgical phases will be measured, including the pre-operative 
preparation time, intra-operative phase, OR clean-up time and sterilization phase in 134 adult 
patients undergoing total knee replacement. Long-standing (hip to ankle) AP and lateral x-rays 
will be utilized to assess the implant's mechanical axis alignment and tibial slope at [ADDRESS_299996]-op day 1 
hemoglobin drop, adverse events, number of trays sent to sterilization, and total waste weight at 
the end of each procedure, considering separately those recyclable and those not recyclable. 
To ensure that the minimum of 134 patients is met, 150 patients will be randomized into two 
treatment cohorts in a 1: 1 ratio. 
Group A: Medacta MyKnee#) Surgical Technique with Efficiency Single-Use Instruments 
Patients randomized to Group A will undergo Total Knee Arthroplasty utilizing patient-matched 
cutting blocks (MyKnee®) and Efficiency single-use instrumentation. 
Group B: Stryker Navigation Surgical Technique with Conventional Metal Instruments 
Patients randomized to Group B will undergo Total Knee Arthroplasty utilizing Stryker Navigation 
technology with conventional metal instrumentation. 
Additional demographic information will be collected to describe the study population and to 
document whether the two treatment groups are clinically comparable. Data collected will include: 
age, gender, BMI, race/ethnicity, smoking history, and employment status, in addition to pre­
operative knee history/diagnosis and degree of pre-operative knee malalignment and Kellgren­
Lawrence grade. 
3 PATIENT RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLE SIZE 
The study participants will be recruited from the patients receiving care with one of the study 
investigators or their practice partners. Participating clinicians and their staff will be notified of this 
protocol and will be asked to refer patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. 
150 patients will be enrolled and randomized to one of the two groups (n=75 for each group). 
3.1 INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by [CONTACT_246617]. Subjects 
must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria to be eligible for the study. 
3.1.[ADDRESS_299997] meet all of the following 
inclusion criteria: 
1)Age 18 to 75 years
2)BMI S35

relative to the mechanical axis.
5)Has retained hardware in the knee that requires removal and interferes with TKA procedure
6)Has prior high tibial osteotomy (HTO)
3.2 Study Procedures 
Patients who are undergoing a unilateral total knee arthroplasty and meet all of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be approached to participate in the study. If consent is obtained 
the study coordinator will be notified. The coordinator 
will randomize the patients in a 1 :1 ratio to 
one of the two treatment cohorts (i.e., MyKnee® surgical technique with single use Efficiency 
Instrumentation or Stryker Navigation with conventional metal instrumentation). The study 
coordinator will notify the clinician of the treatment assignment. Subjects randomized to receive 
the MyKnee® surgical technique will have a CT scan and the investigator will perform appropriate 
pre-operative planning which enables the custom manufacturing of the MyKnee cutting blocks 
that will be delivered to the surgical facility. Subjects randomized to receive the Stryker Navigation 
surgical technique will not require CT scan. At the next visit the patient will undergo the total knee 
arthroplasty procedure utilizing the assigned instrumentation. Timing of various operative and 
sterilization phases will be recorded. Following the procedure, the patient will undergo X-rays at

and posterior tibial slope after total knee replacement, additional operative parameters, and adverse 
events. 
Descriptive statistics, specifically means will be used to summarize the peri-operative, intra­
operative and sterilization time data. 
The primary objective will be met by [CONTACT_246623]-saving 
parameters. The null hypotheses of no differences in mean values between re-usable (Navigation 
with Conventional) and single-use (MyKnee with Efficiency) devices will be tested using separate 
t-tests for two independent groups for each endpoint. A p-value of less than 0.[ADDRESS_300005] differences to be determined in subsequent analyses. 
Descriptive analyses as well as similar two-sample comparisons will be used to evaluate 
secondary measures. 
4.2 Sample Size Analysis 
Sample size for this study was determined on the basis of device group differences observed in 
the Mont et al 2013 study for four (related) but important health care utilization endpoints. The 
table below summarizes the data in Table [ADDRESS_300006] size (standardized mean 
difference) comparing between single-use vs re-useable instruments. The sample sizes required 
for a two sample t-test to obtain 80%, 85%, and 90% power as a function of the observed pooled 
effect sizes were determined. The effect sizes were derived from the reported mean differences 
and p-values. The maximum sample size per group required to achieve at least 80% statistical 
power to reject the null hypothesis of equal group mean was determined across the four outcomes 
summarized in MontTable 2. This sample size was 67 per group or total N=134. This value was 
increased by 12% to N=[ADDRESS_300007] al. '2013 Table 2

5.2 Possible Risks 
It is not expected that the possible risks will increase with the instrument ation options. All risks 
are anticipated with total knee replacement surgery and surgery in general. The following risks 
and discomforts may occur and are considered anticipated in connection with total knee 
arthroplasty procedures at the time of the operation: 
•Complication from Anesthesia •Allergic Reaction •Hemorrhage (Bleeding)
•Immunologic Response •Deep Vein Thrombosis •Pulmonary Embolism
•Vascular Damage •Nerve Damage •Fat Emboli Syndrome
The following risks and discomforts may occur with reusable or single-use instrume ntation: 
•Instrument Breakage •Instrument Malfunction
•Retention of foreign body
[ADDRESS_300010] incision. All medical events and conditions 
that occur prior to this time point are to be captured as pre-existing conditions in the patient's 
medical history. Adverse event collection will conclude at the completion of the final follow-up visit. 
MyKnee and Navigation Protocol 
Medacta Version 29August2017 
Revision 0.0 
Observed and reported adverse events shall be recorded in the patient's study records and on the 
Adverse Event Form within [ADDRESS_300011] include 
the following information at minimum: 
•Event Description
•Date of Onset
•Date of Resolution
•Severity (mild, moderate, severe)
•Seriousness
•Relationship to surgery (definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, not related)
•Relationship to instrumentation (definite, probable, possible, unlikely, not related)
•Event treatment (e.g., none, non-drug therapy, medications, surgery)
•Outcome
Significant new information and updates will continue to be captured in the patient's records as 
they become available. The investigator will follow each subject who experiences an AE until the 
event resolves or no further improvement is expected. If the AE has not resolved by [CONTACT_246624]'s completion, the AE will be listed as ongoing at the time of subject discontinuation. 
6.1 Assessment of Severity
The severity of the adverse event is classified as mild, moderate or severe.
•Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type
causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a
medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.
•Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant
and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_246625]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning.
•Severe: Events interrupt the participant's normal daily activities and generally require
systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.
6.2 Relationship to Surgery/Instrumentation 
The investigator will evaluate the relationship of the adverse event to the research intervention 
according to the following definitions. The term "treatment-related," as it pertains to adverse 
events, means that the event was or may have been attributable to the treatment, or that the 
treatment was or may have been a factor in an event, including those occurring as a result of 
malfunction, poor manufacture, inadequate labeling, or improper design. 
•Definitely
The adverse event is clearly related to the research intervention: the adverse event has a
temporal relationship to the administration of the research intervention, follows a known
pattern of response, or is otherwise logically related to the intervention, and no alternative
cause is present.
•Probably
The adverse event is likely related to the research intervention: the adverse event has a
temporal relationship to the administration of the research intervention, follows a known or
suspected pattern of response, or is otherwise logically related to the intervention, but an
alternative cause may be present.
•Possibly
MyKnee and Navigation Protocol 
Medacta Version 29August2017 
Revision 0.0 
The adverse event may be related to the research intervention: the adverse event has a 
temporal relationship to the administration of the research intervention, follows a suspected 
pattern of response, or is otherwise logically related to the intervention, but an alternative 
cause is present. 
•Unlikely
The adverse event is doubtfully related to the research intervention: the adverse event has
a temporal or other relationship to the administration of the research intervention, but
follows no known or suspected pattern of response, and an alternative cause is present.
•Not Related
The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the research intervention: the adverse event
has no temporal or other relationship to the administration of the research intervention,
follows no known or suspected pattern of response, and an alternative cause is present.
6. 3 Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that:
•Results in death;
•Is life-threatening; the subject was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse
event, or use or continued use of the device or other medical product might have
resulted in the death of the patient;
•Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged);
•Results in disability or permanent damage; the event resulted in a substantial disruption
of the person's ability to conduct normal life functions;
•Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect;
•Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; medical or surgical
intervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body function, or
prevent permanent damage to a body structure.
•Results in any other serious, important medical events; the event does not fit the other
outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes.
In case of Serious Adverse Events (SAE), the Investigator must notify the Sponsor or its 
representative using the Adverse Event Form as soon as possible but at most within [ADDRESS_300012]: Mukesh Ahuja 
E-mail: [EMAIL_4789]
Fax: ([PHONE_5179]
The Investigator should provide additional information on the SAE by [CONTACT_246626]. The Sponsor may also ask for 
additional clinical reports including redacted source documents to be provided by [CONTACT_246627]. Significant new information and updates should continue 
to be submitted promptly to the Sponsor and entered on the Adverse Event CRF as they become 
available, and the Investigator should follow the SAE until it is resolved or no further improvement 
is expected. 
New SAEs will only be documented for each patient until the last study-related clinic visit.

problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device/product, if that effect, problem, or death 
was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol or 
application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device/product that is 
related to the rights, safety, or welfare of subject. Adverse events that might reasonably occur 
because of placement or attempted placement of the product or during follow-up are identified 
through a risk assessment and summarized in the Instructions for Use. 
If Medacta determines that a UADE presents an unreasonable risk to study subjects, Medacta 
will: 
•terminate the investigation, or the parts of the investigation presenting that risk, within
5 working days after making the "unreasonable risk" determination, or within 15 working
days of receiving notice of the UADE
•immediately investigate and evaluate the adverse effect,
•report the results of the investigation to all reviewing IRBs and to all participating
investigators within 10 working days after Medacta receiving notice of the UADE, and
•resume the study, if appropriate, as specified by [CONTACT_1201].

7.2 Good Clinical Practice 
This trial will be conducted in accordance with the current ICH-GCP-guidelines as specified for 
medical devices in ISO [ZIP_CODE]. 
MyKnee and Navigation Protocol 
Medacta Version 29August2017 
Revision 0.0 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human 
subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and well­
being of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible. 
7.[ADDRESS_300016] will receive for 
the treatment of his/her disease. Subjects will be told that alternative treatments are available if 
they refuse to take part and that such refusal will not prejudice future treatment. Finally, they will 
be told that competent authorities may access their records and authorized Sponsor's persons 
without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_6983](s) 
and/or regulations. By [CONTACT_246629] (ICF) the subject or legally acceptable 
representative is authorizing such access.

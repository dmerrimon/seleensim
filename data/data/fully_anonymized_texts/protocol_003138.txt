1.0 OBJECTIVES / SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
The objective of this study is to establish the safety, feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of 
high-dose accelerated intermittent theta burst (iTBS) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(rTMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dl PFC) in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive 
Impairment ( aMCI). We also seek to obtain preliminary efficacy data as well as feasibility / 
acceptability data of computerized cognitive training as an adjunct to iTBS rTMS. The long -term 
goal of this project is to obtain preliminary data to support future empi[INVESTIGATOR_379950], including future randomized controlled trials to devise the optimum rTMS therapeutic 
delivery (with variations in dosing parameters, cortical targeting, and MCI syndro me indications), 
with the ultimate goal of dementia prevention. The scientific merit of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_379951] -
reviewed and subsequently recommended for funding through the National Center of 
Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation (NC NM4R).  
 
AIM 1: Establish the safety  of an accelerated rTMS protocol for neurocognitive 
rehabilitation in aMCI.  We hypothesize that accelerated rTMS will be safe as indexed by 
1) no clinically significant structural brain changes; 2) no decrements in neurocognitive  
function; 3) no significant adverse events.  
AIM 2: Establish the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability  of an accelerated rTMS 
protocol for neurocognitive rehabilitation in aMCI. We hypothesize that 1) aMCI 
patients will consider the treatment accep table and that 2) recruitment and retention will be 
feasible (> 80% retention).  
EXPLORATORY AIM: Establish the preliminary efficacy  of an accelerated rTMS protocol 
for neurocognitive rehabilitation in aMCI. We hypothesize that aMCI patients will 
demonstrat e modest improvements on neurocognitive testing and self -reported affective  
symptoms  and quality of life  from pre - to post -treatment.  
EXPLORATORY AIM: Establish the feasibility, acceptability  of computerized cognitive 
training as an adjunct to accelerated rTMS in MCI. We hypothesize that aMCI patients 
will complete a range of exercises between sessions and at home (feasibility) and will rate 
the intervention as productive (acceptability).  
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the pre-dementia stage in which individuals remain functionally 
intact yet demonstrate the early cognitive and behavioral changes of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Over half of those with MCI develop dementia within [ADDRESS_475429] and decrease healthcare 
costs2. However, the diagnosis and treatment of MCI is hampered by [CONTACT_379970]. That is, the neuropathology of MCI is markedly 
heterogeneous3,4, and neuropsychiatric symptoms are also highly comorbid, including 
depression, anxiety, apathy, and  sleep dysfunction5–7. Thus, the ideal MCI intervention must suit 
a pathologically and behaviorally heterogeneous condition and have a high potential to be 
disseminated for dementia preven tion. 
 
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) 
is one such potential intervention. One hypothesized mechanism of action of this approach is the 
enhancement of cognitive control by [CONTACT_379971], leading to improved 
Version # 10; 1/28/[ADDRESS_475430] (iTBS) rTMS protocols increase the number of sessions per day, reducing the 
treatment course by >50% and yielding more rapid response and remission12,13 while retaining 
safety, feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness14–18. However, the safety and feasibility of this 
delivery schedule has yet to be established for MCI.  
 
In this open -label, safety and feasibility trial, we will recruit 40 amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients 
(target completers N=30) through memory disorders and neuropsychology clinics, as overseen 
by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_379952]. Benitez. We will recruit clinically well -defined par ticipants who 
will meet stringent actuarial neuropsychological criteria for aMCI19. This study will employ 
identical procedures to an ongoing IRB-I approved NC NM4R pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Neuromodulation and 
Plasticity in Cognitive Control Neurocircuitry in Chronic Stroke (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_379953] ; Pro [ZIP_CODE] ). 
Speci fically,  neuronavigation -based targeting of the left dorsolateral prefrontal node of the 
cognitive control network will be performed. This study will utilize accelerated rTMS using a 
MagVenture MagPro TMS System. All participants will receive treatment for  eight, [ADDRESS_475431] -treatment, participants will undergo brain MRI (FLAIR, diffusion, 
T2*/gradient, volumetric scans , resting state ) and computerized neurocognitive testing. As an 
open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there is no sham control group.  
 
 
3.0 INTERVENTION S TO BE STUDIED  
 Accelerated rTMS. We will utilize an LTP -like accelerated  iTBS  rTMS targeted to left dlPFC  in 
aMCI  using a  MagVenture MagPro  TMS System. All participants will receive treatment for eight , 
3-minute sessions on each of three days within a n eight -day span . Each session will be 
separated by 10 minutes , according to participant comfort and preference . As an open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_115834], there is no sham control group.   
RATIONALE: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)  is a means of non -invasively activating 
neuronal elements in the brain. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) in particular causally influences neural 
networks and produce s acute neuroplastic periods that reliably persist after the termination of 
stimulation and promote cortical remodeling22,23. The evidence base for therapeutic rTMS has 
been most persuasive in the case of depression treatment. Proposed as a means of up -regulating 
prefrontal control over dysregulated limbic activation, high -frequency rTMS is most often applied 
to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex24 (dlPFC). Several meta -analyses have now shown that open -
label effects sizes are large, while comparisons to sham sti mulation are at least moderate to large 
among even patients highly resistant to pharmacotherapy25,26. In geriatr ic depression, the FDA -
Version # 10; 1/28/[ADDRESS_475432] higher order 
cognition29 (i.e., executive function). Co-I Dr. McTeague has shown in a large meta -analytic stud y 
that this left dlPFC region (as well as the rest of the cognitive control or multiple demand network) 
is commonly hypo -activated during cognitive tasks across neuropsychiatric disorders30. While 
dementia was not included in this meta -analysis, a similar meta -analysis of task -based fMRI 
identifies prominent hypoactivation in MCI in the same frontoparietal network31. Thus, it is 
unsurprising that other meta -analyses and reviews of mild to moderate AD have shown that rTMS 
improves cognitive ability32 and neuropsychiatric symptoms33 with no adverse cognitive effects34. 
Although research into using rTMS as a treatment for MCI is in its infan cy11, it is an ideal disease 
stage for demen tia prevention using rTMS particularly given that 25 -40% of MCI patients have 
comorbid depression35 which in turn increases risk of further cognitive decline and dementia36. 
Thus, there is abundant preliminary data supporting our rationale to use rTMS of the dlPFC  to 
target neurocircuitry integral to cognitive and affective dysfunction, although its delivery could be 
better optimized to support clinical application.  
 
A therapeutic course of rTMS  typi[INVESTIGATOR_210588] 30 -40 minutes of high -frequency (i.e. 10 Hz) 
treatment on each weekday, for [ADDRESS_475433]. George et al. pi[INVESTIGATOR_379954] S, demonstrating that delivering 3 high -dose sessions per day (i.e. 10 Hz; 3,000 
pulses for 30 mins; 18,000 pulses/day total) on three consecutive days was safe, feasible, and 
suggestive of rapid antidepressant effects14. More recently, a number of groups have 
demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of this form of delivery in which 
sessions are repeated daily, typi[INVESTIGATOR_379955] [ADDRESS_475434] gains in cognition13,17. 
Furthermore, acceptability studies show that accelerated rTMS increases adherence and 
decreases i nterruptions to daily obligations while yielding faster response15–18. Importantly , critical 
to the success of this project is the fact that the procedures proposed in this study have already 
been approved by [CONTACT_379972]4R pi[INVESTIGATOR_50522] (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_379953]; 
Pro [ZIP_CODE]). As such, all methods are already established and running, personnel trained, and, 
importantly, we will be able to compare the results  in two prevalent and functionally impairing 
neurodegenerative disorders.   
 Computerized Cognitive Training.  To collect preliminary feasibility/acceptability data for a 
planned follow -up combinatorial intervention study, participants will complete compute rized 
cognitive exercises  in the intervening periods between same -day rTMS sessions. Clinical trials 
using the online system Brain HQ  (https://www.brainhq.com/world -class -science/science -team ) 
have been shown to be associated with cognitive function in older adults58,59. Each exercise 
takes approximately 3 -10 minutes and adapts to the individual’s progress. The exercises fall 
under one of six categories: processing speed, memory, attention, people skills, cognitive 
flexibility and spatial navigation. During breaks between treatments, pa rticipants will complete 
exercises for a total of 20 minutes of  exercises per day and 60 minutes of  exercises over the 
Version # 10; 1/28/[ADDRESS_475435] 20 minutes of these exercises per day at home during the 4 weeks following treatment completion.   
RATIONALE:  Because a ccumulat ing work suggests that the 10-[ADDRESS_475436] preliminary acceptability/feasibility data of computerized 
cognitive exercises, interleaved between rTMS sessions.

8.0 RECRUITMENT METH ODS 
 
Recruitment  
 
Participants will primarily be recruited through outpatient memory disorders and neuropsychology 
clinics staffed by [CONTACT_379973]/DVA. Clinic providers will be 
trained on study criteria and procedures and will be provided  with recruitment materials. A study 
coordinator will be on -call to facilitate rapid recruitment should a potential participant indicate 
his/her interest to the recruiting provider. [CONTACT_379995] will oversee recruitment and will ensure that 
participants meet eligibility criteria.  
 
Particip ant recruitment  will also include  flyers,  handouts,  electronic  and physical  bulletin  board  
postings,  social  media/message  boards  (i.e., Craigslist,  MUSC  Broadcast  Research  studies  
section  of Yammer,  Instagram,  Facebook),  web-based  recruitment  tools  (e.g.,  ResearchMatch,  
Trial Match),  newsletter/newspaper/media  advertisements,  and recruitment  talks  at local  
community  events/organizations  and surrounding  community.  All approvals  will be obtained  prior 
to displaying  flyers  at the VA, and approvals  will be obtained  in other  community  locations  if/as 
needed . 
 
Version # 10; 1/28/[ADDRESS_475440] of patients who potentially meet eligibility criteria. Study staff will then 
perform a chart review on these patients to further assess inclusion/exclusion criter ia. Patients 
who appear to meet eligibility criteria and have  opted in to being contact[CONTACT_379974], postal mail, and/or email.   
 
Participants who make contact [CONTACT_379975] a description of the study 
purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits of the study by [CONTACT_648]. The potential 
participant will be invited to ask questions until they are satisfied and can make a decision to 
proceed or not with the eligibility phone screen. If the potential participant agrees to continue, a 
phone screen will be conducted to determine eligibility for the next phase of the study.  
 
Eligibility Phone Screening  
 
Trained study staff  will review the eligibility criteria with potential participants. The potential 
participants’ aMCI diagnosis will be verified by [CONTACT_379976] (if he/she is an MUSC patient) 
or by a formal request for medical records initiated by [CONTACT_379977] t o study staff.  PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_379952]. Benitez will personally review all potential participants’ medical records 
to ensure that each MCI patient will meet the detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria, which 
necessitates that the patient has a comprehens ive clinical history and neuropsychological test 
results on file. Should a potential participant not have an established MCI diagnosis, or have 
incomplete data in support of this diagnosis to the extent that his/her eligibility cannot be readily 
ascertaine d, study staff will recommend that he/she complete a clinical  evaluation with a clinical 
neuropsychologist at MUSC or elsewhere, as convenient  to him/her . 
 
 
9.0 CONSENT PROCESS  
 
Following recruitment and screening, the potential participant will be given a copy of the informed 
consent form (ICF) in -person, via postal mail, or e -mail for review. There is no required timeline 
between the ir receipt of the ICF  and deciding whether or not to participate. Participants will be 
encouraged to take their time to decide.  
 
Informed consent will take place on the MUSC campus or through telehealth by [CONTACT_379978] (eConsent). If consenting through telehealth using an IRB -approved elect ronic/online 
platform (i.e. REDCap or musc.doxy.me; all future references to an “electronic/ online platform” 
hereafter refer to these), the study staff will first confirm that participants have the appropriate 
technology to complete the electronic consent  process.  In the case of eConsent, the participant 
will be asked  to locate a private and interruption -free environment in order to complete the 
appointment.  The participant will receive a copy of the signed e -consent by [CONTACT_379979].  If consenting in-person , the  visit will take place in laboratory or Center for 
Biomedical Imaging space at [ADDRESS_475441].   
 
To ensure ongoing consent, p articipants will be queried at the start of any procedure about their 
comfort and willingness to continue.

Session 1: In-person Pre-treatment Neurocognitive /Neuropsychiatric  Assessment (2 - 3 
hours).  Participants will complete computerized co gnitive tests from the NIH Toolbox32 (30-40 
minutes). Each  of these  tests  has been  extensively  normed , compared  to traditional  
neuropsychological  measures . Tests from different batteries will be utilized in this study for 
optimizing a comprehensive but efficient, reliable, and minimally burdensome subset of tests for 
MCI patients.     
 
For further sample characterization with more traditional and more exten sively normed 
neuropsychological measures, participants will complete the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA)47 and the  30-minute battery recommended by [CONTACT_379980] -Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS -CSN) Vascul ar Cognitive Impairment

The option to  remotely complete the M.I.N.I, MoCA, WASI -II, Demographics, Keel TMS Safety 
Screen , IADL questionnaire,  GDS, HAM -D, YMRS , and the PROMIS measures will be given to 
participants if they are unable to physically come to the Center for Biomedical Imaging  for the time 
being, such as due to COVID19 precautions. Phone calls or  video conferencing through 
musc.doxy.me will be utilized  in order to administer and oversee the completion of these 
assessments.   
  
Comfort and reliability considerations:  During the administration of some of the 
neuropsychological assessments, the participants’ verbal responses will be audio recorded for 
quali ty control purposes. During all in -person sessions, snacks and water will be offered between 
testing administrations in order to improve energy, limit fatigue, and promote comfort. 
Furthermore, multiple breaks will be offered. Finally, participants will be  given the option to 
schedule sessions on the same day, with a break, if additional visits/travel would be burdensome.  
 
Session 2 : MRI Scanning  (1 - 2 hour s). At pre - and post -treatment participants will complete 
FLAIR , diffusion, T2*/gradient, perfusion and volumetric scans for assessment of structural 
changes. Participants will also complete a resting -state fMRI scan .  
 
Sessions 3 -5: rTMS  (2 – 3 hours) . A MagVenture MagPro TMS System will be utilized. All 
participants will receive open -label treatment for approximately eight, [ADDRESS_475447] rTMS on each of three days within a n eight -day span. A single 
session=600 pulses at 120 % rMT, iTBS triplets at 50 Hz for 2 s and repeated every 10 s for a total 
of 190 s to left dlPFC. Total pulses=14,400. To enable adherence and retention, the days do not 
need to be contiguous. Same day sessions will be separated by [ADDRESS_475448] the option of completing tasks at home on intervening days during the treatment 
schedule. At the end of the final treatment session , participants will be asked to rate the exercises 
based on difficulty and enjoym ent.  
 
Session 6: In-person Post -treatment Neurocognitive /Neuropsychiatric  Assessment (2 - 3 
hours).  Within one week following treatment, participants will repeat the pre -treatment 
neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive assessment for assessment of pre/post treatment changes.  
 
Session 7: Post -treatment MRI Scans  (1 - 2 hours). Within one week following treatment,  
participants will repeat the pre -treatment MRI scans  for assessment of pre/post treatment 
changes.

11.0 SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND BANKING (Not Applicable)  
 
 
12.0 DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
Analysis  
 
Aim 1 . FLAIR , diffusion, T2*/gradient, perfusion and volumetric scans will be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Antonucci for any new signal abnormality. Adverse events will be surveyed and summarized.  
 
Aim 2 . Retention (i.e., defined as completion of all study sessions) will be determined. Participan ts 
will also complete a survey regarding acceptability, including qualitative responses for treatment 
modification.  
 
Exploratory Aim 3 . Neurocognitive performance and affective symptoms/quality of life will be 
analyzed with repeated -measures mixed models.  
 
Exploratory Aim 4. BrainHQ usage/retention, performance , and acceptability  will be analyzed with 
repeated -measures mixed models.  
 
Power Con siderations . The aims of this study are to determine safety and feasibility. The 
retention rate of 80% was determined to ensure that recruitment in the planned follow -up studies 
would be feasible in the longer time span allowed by [CONTACT_379981] . Although these results will not 
be as compelling in the absence of a sham control, these data will give us an estimate of the 
Version # 10; 1/28/[ADDRESS_475456] sizes and response variability that we can anticipate in future randomized 
controlled trials.  
 
 
13.0 PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_117656]. 
The PI ’s plan for ensuring safety and data integrity follows.  
 
Quality Control . QC will include regular data verification at  weekly meetings with the PI, Co -Is and 
study personnel. This will include verification of the documentation (Integrity of the Consent and 
HIPPA, scores on the assessments, MRI scanning information), study progress and participant 
status, any adverse event s, and any protocol deviations.  Events determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_379957] (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104]) will be reported by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_361630] 10 working days per policy.  
 
Safety Traini ng. Before any investigator or assistant is allowed to enter the scanner room, they 
are required to take an extensive MRI safety course (with annual refresher courses) that cover 
powering down (or quenching) the magnet for patient safety and with establish ed procedures for 
expediting participant contact [CONTACT_379982], should the need arise. These 
courses are run by [CONTACT_379983] a prerequisite for obtaining 
privileges to book and use scanner time. Prior to  administering TMS all personnel must be trained 
and certified by [INVESTIGATOR_124] s. McTeague (Co-I) and Revuelta  (Co-I).  
 
Medical Emergencies:  
 
1. Emergency responding in the scanner is facilitated by [CONTACT_379984] a scan. 
In the event of an emergency, one of these individuals remains with the participant and undocks 
the scanner bed from the magnet bore. This bed can easily be wheeled out of the scan room to 
facilitate speedy access to arriving emergency medical personnel. The second researche r calls 
9-1-1 from the scanner suite and gives details of the participant’s level of medical distress and 
location. Next, this person goes out to the front of the scanner building to flag down arriving 
emergency personnel and to direct them to the particip ant. 
 
2. Dr s. Revuelta and Antonucci  are licensed physicians and will be on call during all sessions and 
rTMS sessions (or a similarly trained ph ysician) to respond to any subtler  potential medical 
situations.  
 
3. These guidelines are in full agreement with the Center for Biomedical Imaging safety protocols 
and with published guidelines by a panel of experts in conducting TMS/rTMS and 
TMS/neuroimaging work for both research and clinical purposes (Rossi et al., 2009).  
 
Suicidal Intent . Particip ants who have made a suicide attempt in the past year will be excluded. 
Also, suicidal intent will be assessed at the initial assessment phase of the study (during MINI 
Depression module) and with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale -Screen Version w ith 
Triage Points. At the initial assessment,  the “Lifeti me/Recent” version will be used . Consistent 
with the triage points determined by [CONTACT_65984], any positive endorsement to items 3 – 6 
will necessitate immediate consultation with the PI. Any po sitive endorsement of items 4 – 6 and 
Version # 10; 1/28/2022 
 
  
  Page 14 of 26 
participation will be discontinued. Depending upon the follow -up to endorsement of item 3 
(passive ideation), participation may also be discontinued. Any participant endorsing these items 
will be referred to immediate consultation with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_379958] -up contact [CONTACT_379985]. For imminent suicidal intent, an emergency 
outpatient appointment or an in -house psychiatric consult will be arranged .  MUSC  police will be 
called directly in the event that the clinician deems the participant to be imminently of risk of 
harming him/herself and refuses to cooperate with a plan to report to the emergency psychiatric 
consult.  
 
Ethical Research Practices . Ethical  guidelines for clinical research will be followed strictly and all 
information obtained in the study will be kept strictly confidential. Data will be assigned coded 
identifiers and all names will be removed from study assessment and outcome data. Files li nking 
participant names or identifying information to the coded identifier will be stored in a password -
protected file, on a password protected desktop computer in a locked laboratory. Demographic 
and other identifying information will be stored separately  from consent forms to eliminate the 
possibility of participant identification; signed consent forms will be locked in secure cabinets 
separate from data files. The files linking names to IDs will be deleted at the conclusion of the 
research project. De -identified data will be stored indefinitely following the conclusion of the 
project. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_379959] -identified data. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_379960]. All researchers will be obligated to demonstrate that they have remained abreast of all 
guidelines and rules related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 
Each member of the research staff will complete f ocused training on each task for which they are 
responsible and will perform ongoing quality control for others performing similar work. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study coordinator will produce quarterly administrative reports describing study progress 
including accru al, demographics, and participants’ status. Reports will describe adherence to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and the study protocol in addition to any unanticipated problems in the 
category of risks to participants or others as well as any adverse events. A ll collected data will be 
obtained for research (and participant safety) purposes only.  
 
Confidentiality . Any discussion  of identifying sensitive and information will occur in private rooms 
at MUSC. Regarding documentation, participants’ names will appear  only on the IRB -approved 
Consent, HIPAA, and payment forms, initial screening form, and in a separate key file that links 
individual participant names and contact [CONTACT_10975] a random participant identification code. 
The participant identification code  will be assigned to the individual during Visit [ADDRESS_475457] protected 
network (MUSC LAN).  The questionnaire data collected through R EDCap will be referenced by 
[CONTACT_379986] a HIPAA compliant interface and downloaded to the MUSC 
server once a participant has completed participantion. If a participant consents to participate at 
the interview, the initial screening form will be entered into a secure electronic database according 
to the assigned participation code and then locked a secure office, separate from payment and 
consent forms including heath information. If a participant declines consent or is lost to follow -up 
(i.e., defined as not appearing for intake within 1 month of screen), the screening form will be 
securely shredded.  The consent, HIPAA, and payment forms will be kept in a locked cabinet in a 
locked office. All other collected paper (e.g., interview r esponses) and electronic (e.g., 
questionnaire, neurocognitive, MRI data) files, including audio recording files, will be identifiable 
Version # 10; 1/28/2022 
 
  
  Page 15 of 26 
only by [CONTACT_379987] (non -MRI data) and Center for Biomedical Imaging (MRI data). The key file 
linking names to IDs will be deleted after data collection is complete.  
 
Consent and HIPAA forms will be kept on file for [ADDRESS_475458] endorses transient alcohol 
or substance abuse during the course of this study, the coordinator will confer with a physician 
co-investigator prior to p roceeding with any treatment.  
 
Adverse Events & Trial Safety . Potential conflicts of interest will be reported using the NIH rules 
for disclosure . Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurring during the course 
of the project will be collected, documented, and reported in accordance with protocol and IRB 
reporting requirements. All research staff involved with adverse event reporting w ill receive 
general and protocol specific AE/SAE training including identification, assessment and evaluation, 
and documentation and reporting. Any potential adverse events will be identified during the course 
of the study from participant self -report and administration of the visit assessments and 
procedures. Research staff will identify adverse events and obtain all available information to 
assess severity, seriousness, study relatedness, expectedness, outcome and the need for change 
or discontinuation in  the study intervention.  
  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any unwanted change, physically, psychologically or 
behaviorally, that occurs in a study participant during the course of the trial is an adverse event. 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defin ed as an adverse event that has one of the following 
outcomes:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929],  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, OR  
• Requires in tervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  
 
 
 
Adverse events are generally documented on AE Logs and AE Case Report Forms (CRFs). 
Additional relevant AE information if available should be documented in a progress note in the 
research record as appropriate to allow monitoring and evaluating of the AE.  
Version # 10; 1/28/[ADDRESS_475459] (IRB) and DSMB within [ADDRESS_475460] cle, Bldg 1, Suite 401 , 
Charleston, SC [ZIP_CODE] . Communication with the IRB is through email, memos, official IRB forms, 
and online reporting.  
 
If complete information is not available when the initial 24 -hour SAE report is disseminated, follow -
up informatio n will be gathered to enable a complete assessment and outcome of the event. This 
information may include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139257], autopsy reports, clinic records, etc. The 
research staff will attach copi[INVESTIGATOR_379961].  
  
We will report adverse events to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_475461] learns of the event. The MUSC IRB AE repor ting requirements are as follows: All deaths that 
occur during the study or [ADDRESS_475462] termination from the study are required to be reported as 
adverse events even if they are expected or unrelated. Other adverse events are reportable to 
the MUSC IRB if  the AE is 1) unexpected AND 2) related or possibly related AND 3) serious or 
more prevalent than expected. All three criteria must be met for an AE to be reported to the MUSC 
IRB. The IRB definition of unexpected is that the AE is not identified in nature , severity or 
frequency in the current protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure or with other current 
risk information. The definition of related is that there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], de vice or intervention. Reportable AEs are reviewed 
by [CONTACT_379988].  
 
The potential risks and benefits and methods to minimize these risks are outlined above. The 
research staff will report any unexpected AE s or any scores of “severe” on the side -effect 
symptom rating form or any FDA -defined serious AEs to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 h ours so that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_379962]. All unexpected AEs will be monitored while they are active to 
determine if trea tment is needed. Study procedures will follow the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice 
Guidelines ( www.fda.gov/oc/gcp ).    
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Procedures .  
 
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_379963] a group of faculty at MUSC  to monitor the data on a bi -annual basis with 
respect to subject safety issues throughout the award period. The data and safety monitoring plan 
will include an internal Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), an ext ernal Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB), and the Institutional IRB.  The purpose of the DSMC, DSMB, and IRB 
are to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) . The internal D SMC will consist of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -
investigators/consultants on the proposal. The functions of the DSMC will include: 1) providing 
scientific oversight; 2) reviewing all adverse effects or complications related to the study; 3) 
monitoring enrollment; 4) rev iewing summary reports relating to compliance with protocol 
requirements; and 5) providing advice on resource allocation. The DSMC will meet quarterly , 
remotely or in -person . The recommendations of the DSMC will be reviewed and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_379964].  
Version # 10; 1/28/[ADDRESS_475463] (DSMB) . A DSMB will be established and will consist of 
professionals with appropriate expertise, who are willing to participate and who do not have any 
conflicts of interest. The DSMB will in clude: 1) two experts in the area of TMS, 2) a biostatistician 
with expertise in the conduct of clinical trials, and 3) two members with expertise in the treatment 
of MCI patients . The DSMB will meet on a  bi-annual basis. The DSMB will perform the following 
activities:  
 
• Review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring.  
• Evaluate the progress of the intervention, including periodic assessments of data quality 
and timeliness, participant recruitment, enrollment, and retention, participant risk versus 
benefit, integrity of the intervention, and other factors that can affect study outcome.  
• Consider factors external to the study when interpreting the data, such as scientific or 
clinical developments that may impact the s afety of study participants or the ethics of the 
study.  
• Make recomm endations to the internal DSMC and MUSC IRB for continuation or 
termination of the trial.  
• Protect the confidentiality of study data and monitoring.  
 
The DSMB will have the authority to temp orarily or permanently discontinue the trial if it perceives 
that harm is occurring due to the intervention. The DSMB will meet with the internal DSMC yearly 
to review adverse event reports, patient complaints if any, and enrollment rates. Data will be 
provided at these meetings by [CONTACT_165483]. The 
DSMB biostatistician will evaluate the confidentiality and integrity of the database and the 
procedures for recording and storing confidential files. The DSMB will al so review the elements 
of the plan to manage emergencies.  
 
Institutional Review Board (IRB).   The MUSC IRB will review and approve the funded protocol; 
review patient and provider consent forms, ensure protection of patient privacy and safety, and 
monitor the study on an ongoing basis. Adverse events will be reported to MUSC IRB as they 
occur.  Annual reports to MUSC IRB will indicate enrollment rates, adverse events, new findings 
that may influence continuation of the study, and reports of the DSMB.  
  
 
14.0 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
 
Early withdrawal of study subjects .  As stated on the Informed Consent, all subjects reserve the 
right to withdraw from the clinical investigation at any time. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_379965]:  
 
• Subject is found to have entered the study in vi olation of the protocol.  
• Subject withdraws consent to participate in the study.  
• Subject is unable to tolerate the pre -treatment MRI.  
• Subject is noncompliant with procedures set forth in the protocol.  
• Subject experiences an Adverse Event that warrants withdrawal from the study.  
• It is in the PI’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_56021]’s best interest to continue.  
Version # 10; 1/28/2022 
 
  
  Page 18 of 26 
• Subject displays other abnormal laboratory, medical or clinical findings for which clinical 
intervention should take precedence over st udy participation including:  
 a) Development of mania/hypomania  
 b) Generalized seizure  
 c) Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 d) Unable to complete desired treatment in the designated time frame  
 
If a participant is lost to follow up, three documented attempts wi ll be made to contact [CONTACT_2416].  
 
 
15.[ADDRESS_475464] been self -limiting, and NONE required further intervention to stop the 
seizure; no post -seizure sequelae or recurrent seizures developed. Extensive precautions with 
regard to suicidal ideation/ho micidal ideation risk will be followed.  
 
Due to the novel nature of the proposed study, the following table  is included to provide a 
representative range of the stimulation parameters and populations examined with accelerated 
rTMS. The dosing range of thes e studies covers the range proposed in this study. In these as well 
as other accelerated rTMS studies, the authors have demonstrated the safety, feasibility and 
acceptability of accelerated, high -dose studies of rTMS in neurologically intact samples. Of 
pertinence to the issue of safety as well as the conceptual model propo sed here, Holtzheimer et 
al.6 showed reliably enhanced neuropsychological performance on the Repeatable Battery for the 
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) from baseline to si x weeks after an 
accelerated, high -dose rTMS protocol in patients with major depression. Furthermore, Baeken et 
al.18,[ADDRESS_475465] -accelerated rTMS. Taken 
together, these studies demonstrate that the potential risks of accelerated rTMS are likely similar 
to conventional once -daily rTMS.

demonstrated the feasibility of using rTMS in depression without any alarming indicators of 
exacerbation of symptoms. The research team will work closely with pa tients to familiarize them 
with the nature of this experimental setup. All staff will also be trained to be alert to any worsening 
of neuropsychiatric symptoms and/or psychosocial impairment. Bipolar patients have at times 
shown hypomanic or manic switches  in the course of once -daily rTMS, as such patients with 
bipolar type I will be excluded. Additionally, all patients will be assessed throughout each day for 
worsening symptoms. Participants will similarly be queried for worsening suicidal ideation/intent.  
Drs. Benitez or McTeague  will additionally assess each patient once per week in -person or via 
telephone during rTMS treatment and the one month  study involvement to assess mood, 
functioning, and safety.  
 
Potential risk of a seizure with TMS . There is a risk that TMS can cause a seizure; but it is rare. 
The risk of seizure induction is related to the intensity, duration, frequency and rest interval of 
stimulation. Following the adoption and widespread use of the safety guidelines from a National 
Institute  of Neurological Disorders and  Stroke  (NINDS) workshop on TMS, only [ADDRESS_475467] 
been reported since 1997, and they usually involved parameters of "higher settings" th an the "safe 
range". To our knowledge, stimulation with the parameters and settings proposed in this study 
should not cause seizures. Each subject’s stimulus intensity is determined by [CONTACT_379989]. In this study participants will 
receive rTMS to the prefrontal co rtex, a region far less prone to seizure. Nonetheless, we will 
watch participants  closely for any signs of seizure throughout all procedures. Additionally, o ur 
study patients will be free from using known stimulants and medications that are known to 
increase the risk of seizure (e.g., theophylline).  
 
Other potential effects of TMS on brain tissue . TMS is thought to be safe, with no brain damage, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_379966].  [CONTACT_95052] and colleagues35 have recently 
completed a case report of a maintenance treatment of rTMS  for depression over a year, where 
a depressed patient received a total of [(16,000 x 2 trials) + (8,000 x 12 trials)] = 32,000 + 96,000 
= 128,000 stimuli over a year period. The patient's MRI showed no structural changes at the end 
from baseline. The pati ent experienced no seizures and had tolerated the procedure equally 
throughout the successive trials.  [CONTACT_95052] and colleagues have al so reported a safety study44 
looking at the MRI scans before and after 2 weeks of daily left prefrontal rTMS for depress ion. McGirr et al.41 60,000  10 20 120%  Major Depression 10 Hz; 5s train, 25s ITI 27 Modirrousta et al.42 90,000  3 30 110%  Major Depression 10 Hz; 5s train, 25s ITI 18 Williams et al.28 90,000  5 10 90% Major

Version # 10; 1/28/[ADDRESS_475468] been no reports of deleterious changes (more 
than a minute) in cognitive function (memory, attention, etc.) in rTMS studies. Safety studies 
specifically looking for these changes did not find any effects  of rTMS. Holtzheimer et al.[ADDRESS_475469] been 
observed in Alzheimer’s  Disease and schizophrenia21. This study will assess for potential changes 
in cognitive function with pre - and post -treatment cognitive batteries designed to look for potential 
TMS effects, if they exist.  
 
Potential hearing loss . The discharge o f the rTMS coil generates a high -energy click that may 
cause cochlear damage. Humans exposed to rTMS have shown temporary increases in auditory 
threshold (especially at high frequencies) lasting at least [ADDRESS_475470] -degree burn . The TMS coil can heat up during use.  The machine used in this study 
has two major protective engineering features: (1) an external heat monitor that will shut down 
the system if the coil gets too warm; and (2) a liquid -coiled coil design that keeps the coil much 
cooler than previ ous models.  Additionally, all patients will have a foam insert placed between the 
coil and their scalp for comfort and also to act as additional thermal protection. The TMS treater 
will periodically monitor coil temperature during each treatment.  
 
Potential risks related to delaying other psychotropic treatments . The investigators are sensitive 
to the ethical concerns of withholding changes in antidepressant medication from depressed 
patients or withdrawing them from antidepressants in an acute cris is due to their participation in 
a clinical trial. Thus in this trial, patients are allowed to stay on medications and to have their 
physicians adjust doses or even start new medications. The rationale is that the effects of 
medication changes or new medic ations are rarely visible within the ‘trial’ of acute TMS. Thus, 
ethically treatment as usual will be allowed and also address our hypothesis, without subjecting 
patients to slower medication adjustments by [CONTACT_19212].  
 
MRI risks . Exposure  to magnetic field strengths used in the present study is not shown to be a 
significant health risk. Risks to an unborn fetus from exposure to the MRI field strength used in 
the proposed research (3 Tesla) are unknown. Participants will be asked to lie sti ll and awake for 
Version # 10; 1/28/2022 
 
  
  Page 21 of 26 
50-60 minutes in the scanner and this can occasionally result in soreness, stiff back, etc. 
Participants will be queried approximately every 10 minutes about their comfort. The main risk 
associated with MR imaging is the possibility of int roducing metal to the magnet or its close 
proximity. Participants are thoroughly screened to prevent metal being brought into the MR 
environment. Other potential hazards of MRI scanning include: collision hazards, noise, 
neurostimulation at rapid sampling rates (i.e., short TRs), body temperature changes, helium, and 
nitrogen hazards. The MRI facility is tested regularly by [CONTACT_379990]. These risks are minimal, and the facility is run within FDA guidelines. All investigator s and 
research assistants running participants in the Center for Biomedical Imaging are thoroughly 
trained in MR safety as a requirement to run scans.  
 
Confidentiality Risks.  There is a risk of a loss of confidentiality of personal information as a result 
of participation in any study. This is why all study records and audio recordings will be placed in 
a locked, secure, limited access location. Participation in the study and the information provide d 
will be treated as confidential. The information we colle ct will contain a code number and not a 
name [CONTACT_379994]. Codes linking numbers and names will be kept in a locked secure 
location and will not be accessible to anyone outside the research team. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_379967]’ an onymity and confidentiality, there is always some minimal risk of people other 
than the study investigators gaining access to health information. Every effort will be made to 
ensure that health information will be collected and stored in a manner that ensu res the highest 
level of protection of confidentiality.  
 
 
16.0 POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS OR OTHERS  
 
High frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) is FDA -approved for the treatment of major depression. 
Work by [CONTACT_379991] 
(dlPFC) site targeted with rTMS to remediate depression is seated in an area of cortex integral to 
efficient and adaptive higher order cognition (i. e., executive function) . Furthermore, Co-I Dr. 
McTeague  has demo nstrated that this left dlPFC region is commonly hypoactivated during 
cogni tive tasks across disorders . Thus, it is not surprising that cognitive improvements have been 
reported as ancillary benefits to rT MS treatment for depression . We propose that becaus e rTMS 
to dlPFC is targeting cognitive neurocircuitry integral to adaptive functioning, that promoting 
neuroplasticity in this network with rTMS could be optimized to improv e neurocognitive impairment 
in MCI. At present there is no FDA -approved treatment f or cognitive impairment in  MCI; all 
clinically available interventions (e.g. medication, cognitive rehabilitation) specific to ameliorating 
cognitive decline are either provided off -label or have limited efficacy per the literature . 
 
 
17.0 SHARING OF RESULTS WITH SUBJECTS  
 
We will inform participants of any new or relevant information that might influence their desire to 
continue participating in the study. We will also provide participants with a n oral  summary of their 
clinical outcomes should it be desired by [CONTACT_2299].

Prefrontal rTMS at this intensity, frequency and number of stimuli has been considered "non -
significant risk"  by [CONTACT_379993]. (See the uploaded letter from the FDA; FDA_George.pdf). It is also FDA approved (Oct

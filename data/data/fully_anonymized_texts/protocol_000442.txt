Full Title:      Multi -modal Analgesia to Reduce Narcotics After Scrotal Surgery   
Short Title:      Narcotic Reduction After Surgery   
Clinical Phase:     III 
Principal Investigator:    [INVESTIGATOR_147131]:   The use of non -narcotic multi -modal analgesia to be used in the pre -
operative, peri -operative and post -operative period to reduce or 
potentially eliminate narcotic usage following scrotal surgery. We have 
shown that the use of anti -inflammatories in the pe ri-operative period 
reduce both pain and narcotic use. Our hypothesis is that adding 
another agent in the multi modal pathway will further reduce pain and 
potentially reduce narcotic usage.  
Sample Size:   N= 86 (43 participants  in each arm ) 
Enrollment:   This study will enroll 86 participants  but will screen 114 participants  
accounting for an approximate 2 5% screening failure rate .   
Study Population:   Participants  undergoing micros urgical  testicular sperm extraction for 
non-obstructive azoospermia . 
Enrollment  Period:   2 years .  
Study Design:   Double -blind, placebo -controlled , randomized  trial 
  Two s tudy arms ( 43 participants  per arm)

2. Background  
 
2.1 Disease  
 
Microdissection testicular sperm extraction (microTESE)  is the gold standard for sperm 
retrieval in research study partic ipants  with non -obstructive azoospermia for in vitro 
fertilization .[ADDRESS_168233] -operative pain and  
improper narcotic utilization has become a significant societal problem.2  
 
2.2 Investigational Agent /Device , or Research intervention  
 
Multi -modal analgesia has been used as an alternative to reduce narcotic usage in the peri -
operative and post -operative period following scrotal surgery. Our p revious work has 
looked at the role of anti -inflammatorie s, specifically COX -[ADDRESS_168234] including reduced hyperexcitability of neurons resulting in cent ral 
desensitization, decreased calcium entry caused by [CONTACT_147150].6 Gabapentin is water solub le and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_147132] -dependent 
bioavailability, with a half -life of approximately 5 -7 hours.7 For this reason it is commonly 
dosed up to three times per day. It is cleared renally, and not metabolized and has no 
Protocol 19-08020686   
Version  4.20.202 3 
 
 
Page # [ADDRESS_168235] -herpetic neuralgia. The use 
of gabapentin in this study is considered investigational (ie. it is used for an unapprove d 
indication). Investigators seek an IND exemption as the study uses gabapentin to assess pain 
reduction and gabapentin consumption after scrotal surgery.  This study does NOT intend to 
support a significant change in the advertising for a prescription prod uct, FDA approval of a 
new indication or a significant change in the product labeling, or FDA approval of change in 
route of administration, dose, and/or patient population.

4.4 Lifestyle Considerations  
 
Not applicable.  
 
4.5 Screen Failures   
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subsequently randomly assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of 
screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, 
to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen 
failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SA E). 
 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of a n 
inability to take either study drug  may be rescreened. Rescreened participants should be assigned 
the same participant number as for the initial sc reening.

 7.9 Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
In the absence of delays  in administration of the investigational drug  due to adverse event(s), drug 
administration  may cont inue in the post -operative period for three days  addition to the pre -
operative period. Other reasons may include:  
 
o Intercurrent illness that prevents furthe r administration of investigational drug , 
o Unacceptable adverse event( s) 
o Subject  decides to withdraw from the study, or  
o General or specific changes in the subject ’s condition render the subject  unacceptable for 
further administration of drug  in the judgment  of the investigator  
 
7.[ADDRESS_168245] s removed from study for 
unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the advers e event.   
 
7.11 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding   
  
Permuted blocked randomization will be performed.  A series of randomized blocks with a defined 
block size will be generated with a 1:1 allocation ratio to allow for an equal number of participants  in 
the study drug and placebo groups.  A statistician from  the Weill Cornell CTSC Biostatistics, 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_147139] (BERD) Core will create the randomization list and will not be 
involved with the study statistician(s).  The randomization list will also reside in the Research 
Pharmacy.  Only the BER D statistician and the Research Pharmacy will have a copy of the blocked 
randomization list and will know the true meaning of the block assignments.  If unbinding is 
necessary, the BERD statistician (or Research Pharmacy) can immediately determine whether or not 
the participant  received the study drug or placebo.  
 
7.12 Study Intervention/Follow -up Compliance  
 
Study participant  adherence will be completed in the form of a reminder phone call. Participants  
will be required to complete questionnaires for a visual analogue scale as well as daily narcotic 
usage.  
 
Participants  will be seen for their study materials at their usual po st-operative follow -up visit. 
Two attempts will be made to contact [CONTACT_147151] -up visit 
or provide the necessary study documents, at which point the subject will be considered “lost to 
follow -up” and no longer partici pating in the study.  
 
8. Study Intervention Discontinuation and Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal  
 
Participants may withdraw voluntarily from the study  or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_147140] a participant from the 
study at any time. The following adverse events would necessitate discontinue of the study intervention 
or participant discontinuation/withdrawal:

Participants may discontinue the study intervention, but remain in the study for follow -up, especially for 
safety and efficacy stu dy endpoints (if applicable).  
 
 
8.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention  
 
Discontinuation from gabapentin administration  does not mean discontinuation from the study, and 
remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically 
significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment,  
the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is 
needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE).  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinua tion will include the following:  
• Post -operative follow -up to ensure any adverse event resolution  
 
8.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such  that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Participant una ble to receive the medication  
• Participant lost to follow -up after several attempts to contact [CONTACT_57418].  
Subjects will be medically monitored by [CONTACT_147152]. The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on 
the Case Report Form (CRF).  Subjects who sign the infor med consent form and are randomized but 
do not receive the study intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent 
form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are 
withdrawn or discontinued from the study, will not  be replaced.

• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_62541] 4 weeks  
and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining th e assigned visit schedule and 
ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where po ssible, 2 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the partici pant continue to be unreachable, he will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 
 
 
 
10.  Measurement of Effect  
 
Effect of pain will be measured using the validated numerical rating scale.  
 
Narcotic consumption will be recorded as a numerical value.  
 
10.1 Response Criteria  
  
The study participants  will be prompted to complete online surveys administered through 
REDCap. The REDCap database allows for HIPAA compliant data gathering through this format.  
Each survey will include the following: a numerical rating scale (0 through 11) to rank current 
pain, number of narcotic tablets consumed since the prior survey, overall satisfaction of pain 
control (binary yes/no) as well documentation of other related symptoms (ie. nausea).   
 
 
 
11. Data Reporting / Regulatory Considerations  
 
11.1 Data Collection  
 
The data collection plan for this study is to utilize REDCap to capture all research inte rvention 
procedures outlined in the protocol , toxicity, efficacy, and adverse event data for all enrolled 
study participants . To ensure maximum compliance, subjects will be prompted by [CONTACT_6968], phone, 
or with a text message to their mobile phone. To ensure HIPAA compliance, text messages will 
only rea d as “A new survey is due.” Participants will be informed of this prompting protocol 
beforehand. No PHI, or any details of medical therapy, will be revealed in the text message or in 
the surveys administered through REDCap (please see the survey attachment  to review how 
each survey will appear). Texts will be sent from a study dedicated phone controlled by [CONTACT_28023].  The study phone will be encrypted and managed by [CONTACT_147154]. 
Subjects will complete surveys at the following intervals: eve ry [ADDRESS_168248] -operative day 3 through 7.

that is fully supported by [CONTACT_57421] -Cornell Medical Center CTSC.  It is a tool for the 
creation of customized, secure data management systems that include Web -based data -
entry forms, reporting tools, and a full array of security features including user and 
group based privileges, authentication using institution LDAP system , with a full audit 
trail of data manipulation and export procedures.  REDCap is maintained on CTSC -
owned servers that are backed up nightly and support encrypted (SSL -based) 
connections.  Nationally, the software is developed, enhanced and supported throu gh a 
multi -institutional consortium led by [CONTACT_57422] . 
 
11.[ADDRESS_168249]/Ethics Committee Approval  
 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Investigator will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, before study initiation.  
Before initiation of the study at each study center, the protocol, the ICF, other written material 
given to the study participants , and any other relevant study documentation will be submitted to 
the appropriate Ethics Committee. Written approval of the study and all relevant study 
information must be obtained before the study cen ter can be initiated or the IP is released to the 
Investigator. Any necessa ry extensions or renewals of IRB approval must be obtained for changes 
to the study, such as amendments to the protocol, the ICF, or other study documentation. The 
written approval of the  IRB together with the approved ICF must be filed in the study files.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_147141]. The Investigator will submit 
written summaries  of the study status to the IRB as required. On completion of the study, the IRB 
will be notified that the study has ended.  
 
All agreed protocol amendments will be clearly recorde d on a protocol amendment form and will 
be signed and dated by [CONTACT_86317]. All protocol amendments will 
be submitted t o the relevant institutional IRB for approval before implementation, as required by 
[CONTACT_427]. Th e only exception will be when the amendment is necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial participants. In this case, the necessary action will be taken first, 
with the relevant protocol amendment following shortly thereafter.  
Once protocol a mendments or consent form modifications are implemented at the lead site, Weill 
Cornell Medicine, updated documents will be provided to participating sites , as applicable . Weill 
Cornell Medicine must approve all consent form changes prior to local IRB subm ission.  
Relevant study documentation will be submitted to the regulatory authorities of the participating 
countries, according to local/national requirements, for review and approval before the beginning 
of the study. On completion of the study, the regul atory authorities will be notified that the study 
has ended.

Participants  will receive reduced oxycodone prescriptions (quantity to be determined by [CONTACT_147156])  as needed , as well as celecoxib and acetamino phen  to be taken as 
prescribed  for the peri -operative period and up to [ADDRESS_168254] -op days participants in both the intervention and control arms will be 
asked to maintain a pain diary.  The diary will be implemen ted online through the REDCap platform, 
which allows for secure online surveys. To ensure maximum compliance, subjects will be prompted 
by [CONTACT_6968], phone, or with a text message to their mobile phone. To ensure HIPAA compliance, text 
messages will only read as “A new survey is due.” Participants will be informed of this prompting 
protocol beforehand. No PHI, or any details of medical therapy, will be revealed i n the text message 
or in the surveys administered through REDCap (please see the survey attachment to review how 
each survey will appear). Texts will be sent from a study dedicated phone controlled by [CONTACT_8702].  The study phone will be encrypted and  managed by [CONTACT_147154]. Subjects will 
complete surveys at the following intervals: every [ADDRESS_168255] of care. This will be assessed using 
the 11-point numerical pain rating scales (NRS -11) from post -operative day 1 to 7.  
 
Our secondary endpoints include narcotic use following surgery including the number of tablets 
taken, frequency and time when narcotic is initially utilized. Participant  satisfaction will be 
documented. Reduction in other symptoms such as nausea will also be recorded.  
 
12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
The primary objective of this double -blind, placebo controlled randomized trial is to compare the 
participant -reported pain scores taken on an 11 -point numerical rating scale (NRS -11) between 
subjects  who received Gabapentin and controls  who received placebo on day -[ADDRESS_168256] gabapentin has on symptom 
modification.  
 
Assuming a baseline NRS -11 score of 3.8 (from previous study) and a goal is to detect a two -point 
difference (reduction) in the day -7 pain score between the two groups, a sample size of 86 
participants  (43 per arm) will yield a power of 80% when using a two -sample t -test with a 0.05 two -

Version  4.20.202 3 
 
 
Page # 16 
 sided significance level.  To account for potential loss to follow up and drop -out at a rate of 2 5%, 
each arm will require [ADDRESS_168257] of celecoxib in the same patient setting.3  
 
Approximately 150 to 250 microTESE procedures are conducted at our site annua lly. As a result, we 
plan to accrue and complete the study in 29 months (i.e. ~9 study participants  per month).  
 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated to describe the cohort of study participants  using N (%) and 
mean, median, range for categorical and continuous factors, respectively.  A two -sample t -test or 
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be used, as appropriate, to compare the mean (median) 
participant -reported pain scores on day [ADDRESS_168258] or Fisher’s exact test will be used, as appropriate, to compare the proportion of narcotic use 
post -scrotal surgery between the two arms and to compare the proportion of adverse events 
experienced post -scrotal surgery between the two arms. Similar analyse s will also be completed on 
the NRS -[ADDRESS_168259] -scrotal surgery. 
Generalized estimating equations (GEE) modeling will also be performed to compare NRS pains 
scores, assessed over all post -operative  days 1 to 7, between the gabapentin and placebo groups.  
GEE allows for multiple observations per participant  (i.e., pain scores for day 1 to day 7, per 
participant ) and also allows for the incorporation of missing pain scores at some of the defined time 
points.  
 
All p -values will be two -sided with statistical significance evaluated at the 0.[ADDRESS_168260] will be calculated to assess the 
precision of the obtained estimates.  All ana lyses will be performed in R Version 3.6.1 (R Foundation 
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).   Note:  The statistical considerations section was written 
in conjunction with Charlene Thomas, MS, in the Division of Biostatistics and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], 
Department of Healthcare Policy & Research.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_168261] 
95% confidence intervals around the toxicity proportions will be calculated to assess the 
precision of the obtained estimates.  
 
 
13. Adverse Event  Reporting Requirements  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The investigator will 
be required to provide appropriate information concerning any findings that suggest significant hazards, 
Protocol 19-08020686   
Version  4.20.202 3 
 
 
Page # [ADDRESS_168262] s or 
observed by [CONTACT_147157], as well as by [CONTACT_147158] l aboratory 
tests, x -rays, electrocardiographs, etc.  
 
13.1 Adverse Event Definition  
 
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug, and does not imply any judgment about causalit y. An adverse event can arise with any use of the 
drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
  
13.1.1  Investigational Agent or Device Risks (Expected Adverse Events)  
 
Gabapentin is a medication known to treat seizures. It does have known adverse events 
especially when taken at high doses. As per the FDA  in participants  taking gabapentin for pain, 
side effects occurring >8% of the time compared  to placebo include dizziness, somnolence, and 
peripheral edema. Other side effects were seen in less than 5% including asthenia, GI symptoms, 
weight gain, abnormal thinking, incoordination, ataxia, or ocular symptoms.  
 
 
13.1.2  Adverse Event Characteristics and Related Attributions  
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 .0 will be utilized 
for AE reporting .  A copy of the CTCAE version 5 .0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the research intervention . 
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the research intervention . 
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the research intervention . 
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the research intervention . 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the research intervention .

13.3 AE/SAE Follow Up  
 
 All SAEs and AEs reported during this study will be followed until resolution or until the investigator 
confirms that the AE/SAE has stabilized and no more follow -up is required. This requirement indicates 
that follow -up may be required for some events af ter the subject  discontinues participation from the 
study.  
 
13.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up  
 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study  visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.

Version  4.20.202 3 
 
 
Page # 19 
 All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilizati on of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be cons idered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duratio n of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The primary investigator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Events will be followed fo r outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
14. Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  
 
14.1 Definition of Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
 
 The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency give n (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studi ed; 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the r esearch places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized . 
 
 
 
14.1.2  Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
 
The investigator will report unanticipated problems ( UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] s) to the reviewing Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) and to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)/lead principal investigator (PI).

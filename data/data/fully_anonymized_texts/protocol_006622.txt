 Study Synopsis  
Study  Title  A Multi -Center, Double -Blind, Sham -Controlled, 
Randomized Trial  of Dual Field  PEMF Therapy [Provant® 
Therapy System] in Lower Extremity Painful Diabetic 
Distal Symmetric  Peripheral Neuropathy (DSPN)  (The 
RELIEF Trial)  
Protocol Number  RBI.2017.002  
Name [CONTACT_231698]® Therapy System  
Phase of Development  III 
Objective  To demonstrate the analgesic eff icacy  of PEMF  treatment 
compared to sham treatment in patients with painful diabetic 
distal symmetric  peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) when treatment 
is administered 30 min utes twice daily through a 1 20-day period 
(4 months)  (Part A) .  An 8-month open -label active treatment 
extension period is included to collect longer -term data on pain, 
medication use , quality of life  and safety  (Part B).  
Study Design  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Part A of this trial  is a multi -center, prospective, double -blinded, 
sham -controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted on subjects 
with painful diabetic distal  symmetric peripheral neuropathy. 
Part B of this trial is a n 8-month single -arm, open -label , active 
treatment extension period upon completion of Part A . 
 
Eligible subjects will include those between 22 and 80 years of 
age with documented Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes having persistent 
pain related to diabetic neuropathy in the lower extre mities, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_231630](s). Subjects will be assessed with the  
Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score  at screening , to evaluate the 
severity of peripheral neuropathy for inclusion.    
 
Eligible subjects will be entered into a [ADDRESS_279326] average baseline pain scores related to their 
diabetic neuropath y in the lower extremities, diary compliance, 
and analgesic consumption (maintenance and prn prescribed 
peripheral neuropathic pain medication  pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685] ). Subjects will 
collect electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) data each 
morning around the same time during the run -in period.  Only 
those subjects having a mean pain intensity in the lower 
extremities of  ≥4 and <9 on an 11 -point numeric pain rating scale 
(NPRS) and a diary compliance score of ≥ 70% during the 14 -
day run -in period will be eligible.    
 
Subjects will return to the clinic at Baseline (Day 0) for review 
of eligibility, diary compliance, avera ge baseline diabetic 
6 
710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
  neuropathic pain score  of ≥4 and <9 (calculated as the average of 
the last 7 days preceding the enrollment visit), and review of 
stable analgesic pain consumption profile during the 14 -day run -
in period.  Qualified subjects based on di ary compliance and 
average pain score will be randomized 1:1 (active: sham) and will 
be instructed to self -treat twice daily (morning and evening; 8am 
± 2 hours and 8pm ± 2 hours) for [ADDRESS_279327]  
electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) data following each 
morning treatment for [ADDRESS_279328] a baseline Skin Perfusion 
Pressure (SPP), Sural Nerve Conduction Studies  (NCS), 
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), and  will complete the Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire  (WPAIQ) , 
and NeuroQoL .  
 
Subjects will receive a telephone call at Day 7 to ensure 
compliance to treatment and diary completion, provide follow -
up information on the biopsy site s (if applicable), complete a 
blinding assessment as well as be assessed for safety and 
concomitant medic ation changes.   
 
At Month 1  subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of 
safety, concomitant medication changes, review device usage 
(reports will be supplied to the site) and ePRO diary completion, 
and Patient Global Impression (PGI).  Treatment satisfaction will 
also be assessed.  
 
At Month 2 subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of 
safety, concomitant medication changes , treatment satisfaction, 
review of device usage (reports will be supplied to the site) and 
ePRO diary completion, qu ality of life outcomes ( WPAIQ and 
NeuroQo L), Patient Global Impression (PGI), and interim visit 
measurements of SPP.  
 
At Month 3 , subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of 
safety, concomitant medication changes, review device usage 
(reports wil l be supplied to the site) and ePRO diary completion, 
and Patient Global Impression (PGI).  Treatment satisfaction will 
also be assessed.  
 
At Month 4  (end of Part A / start of Part B ), subjects will return 
to the clinic for evaluation of safety, treatment satisfaction, 
review of device usage (reports will be supplied to the site), 
HbA1c, concomitant medication changes, weight, quality of life

Statistical Considerations  All safety analyses will be performed on the intent to  treat 
population  from Part A of the study , defined as all subjects who 
were enrolled into the study and issued a study device when 
randomized.  Once a subject is determined to be eligible, after 
completion of the run-in period, the subject will be enrolle d and 
randomized into the study and become part of the ITT population.  
 
All recorded data will be listed by [CONTACT_231660].  
Descriptive statistics will be tabulated for all randomized 
subjects for the change from baseline to study day 121, and 
separately for the change from baseline to the last recorded set of 
evaluations.  The latter should include all subjects who were 
randomized and completed at least one set of evaluations after 
randomization.  
14 
710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
  
A pre -specifi ed sub-group analysis will b e performed on subjects 
with pain scores ≥ 5 as well as subjects with A1C above and 
below 8.5.  
 
All hypothesis tests comparing active and sham treatment will be 
two-sided and conducted at the 5% significance level  based on 
Part A of the study .  The primary  population for assessing 
efficacy and safety will be the ITT population  from Part A .  A 
secondary analysis of the individual efficacy endpoints will be 
conducted using the Per -Protocol population  from Part A .   All 
summary tables will be presented by [CONTACT_231661].  
Continuous variables will be summarized using the following 
descriptive statistics: n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maximum.  Categorical variables will be summarized using 
counts and percentages.  Percentages presented will be calculated 
using all patients in the analysis population being summarized 
(with randomized or received treatment as/if appropriate) as the 
denominator.  
 
To compare the absolute change in pain from basel ine to 4-
months, the intra -patient change will be calculated and serve as 
the dependent variable in the analysis.  The baseline pain score 
will be introduced in the model as a covariate.  Clinical site will 
be added to the model to assess poolability of th e data across 
sites.  Interaction between clinical site and treatment will be 
evaluated using a type 1 error rate of 10%.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_231662], type, frequency, severity, and relationship to the study 
device.  Adverse events will be provided in a listing.  
 
SAS® Version 9. 4 or later will be used to produce all statistical 
tables, listings and figures to be contained in the integrated 
statistical/clinical report.

Diabetic d istal symmetric peripheral neuropathy  (DSPN) is the most common form of diabetic 
neuropathy and accounts for approximately 75% of diabetic neuropathies .3 Clinical presentation 
and clinical course  of diabetic neuropathy varies  in prevalence associated with both the duration of

damage, patien ts present with distal symptoms that progress proxi mally affecting the lower 
extremities more prominently than the upper extremities.  Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_231637].   
The c linical presentation of DSPN  initially involves the feet.  DSPN leads to balance issues, causing 
fall and fractures.  Initially affects smaller unmyelinated fibers which convey pain and unpleasant 
temperature sensation s.  With progression,  larger myelinated  fibers are affected and can be the 
cause of numbness, tingling,  and insensate feet leading to diabetic foot ulceration  (Table 2).3

tendons and fascial tissue causes mechanical and conformational changes in the architecture of the 
foot.  Gait abnormalities, impaired balance and falls frequently ensue.  In advanced peripheral 
diabetic neuropathy,  the patient no longer senses pain developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a loss of the protective sensation 
(LOPS ), the most common component in the pathway to the development of diabetic foot 
ulcerations (DFU) and Charco t neuroarthropathy.6.7,10 Combined with ischemia  and infection, 
LOPS may culminate in amputation.  DFUs a re responsible for more hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231638] 5% of diabetic patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_231639] U.S. each year 
and 1% of those patients requiring an amputation .8 
The p athophysiology for DSPN , as noted above, is complex and involves multiple mechanistic  
pathways.  Hyperglycemia in concert with insulin resistance and abnormal adiposity leads to the 
accumulation of advanced glycation end products  (AGE), toxic effects of free fatty acids and pro -
inflammatory adipokines .  These factors damage nerve fibers, e ffecting initially smaller 
unmyelinated C -fibers and progressively advancing to damage larger myelinated fibers.  Direct 
axonal injury occurs secondary to endothelial injury , causing endothelial dysfunction  and reduction

710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) leve ls, leading to small vascular vasoconstriction, larger vascular 
calcifications and constriction, which ultimately result in nerve ischemia.6,7, 8     
Therapeutic intervention for the prevention and treatment of DSPN  include s optimized glycemic 
control, dietary and lifestyle based counselling, antioxidant -rich nutrition, weight management, 
moderate exercise, routine foot screening , proper foot wear, and avoidance of alcohol and tobacco . 
Other than tight glycemic control, there are no effective treatments that target the patho physiology  
of DSPN . In addition to glycemic control, d iabetic neuropathy management has focused 
predominantly on symptomatic pharmaceutical pain control with analgesics and medications such 
as pregabalin and duloxetine (FDA approved fo r the treatment of neuropathic pain from diabetes).3

Potential Therap eutic Value of Pulsed Electromagnetic Energy Fields ( PEMF) for DSPN  
Provant® Therapy System  is a medical device manufactured by [CONTACT_231664], Inc. 
(Scottsdale, AZ) , that  has been cleared by [CONTACT_1622]  (K972093, K091791, AN D K131979) “for 
adjunctive use in the palliative treatment of post -operative pain and edema in superficial soft 
tissue.” The device delivers self-administ ered, non -thermal, non -ionizing pulsed electromagnetic 
energy  to the target tissue, using 27.12 MHz pulses lasting 42 microseconds and delivered 1000 
times per second.  The system generates an electromagnetic field that is continuously monitored 
and regula ted to ensure consistent dosing.  Life Science laboratory research led to Provant Therapy’s 
energetic settings, which have been associated with reductions in  post-operative chronic pain in a 
clinical trial.  Provant Therapy is dual -field electromagnetic ene rgy (i.e. high electric  and magnetic 
fields) .  High energy electric and magnetic fields in combination have been associated with changes 
in gene expression which are involved in pain and inflammation pathways in laboratory studies .23,[ADDRESS_279354] the treatment site. The device is non -invasive and does not require placement of surface or 
deep electrodes, nor removal of bandages or clothing. Treatm ent is usually imperceptible and very 
well tolerated. Evidence suggests that  the Provant® Therapy System  can reduce pain, promote 
healing, and promote restored range of motion following reparative surgery in wounded 
extremities.19,[ADDRESS_279355] P EMF  functions by [CONTACT_231665]. In vitro  studies  demonstrated that PEMF  treatment of cells in culture 
can mediate wide -spread changes in transcript levels encoding factors involved in pain and the 
inflammatory response  (including endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], growth factors, cytokines, and cell cycl e 
regulating factors),20,21,[ADDRESS_279356] provided evidence that PEMF therapy improves nerve growth and may 
improve nerve function through up -regulation of genes involved in neurogenesis (data on file). In 
addition, genes related to angiogenesis have also been shown to be up -regulated.   
An exploratory prospective randomized, sham -controlled study  was recently conducted at two sites 
using the Provant® Therapy System  to (a) evaluate small fiber nerve growth and function in subjects 
with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy  and to (b) determine the safety and feasibility of Provant  
in such subjects . Twenty -three  subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy were treated for 
[ADDRESS_279357] of care 
treatment.  
Nineteen  subjects in this study were evaluated for the effectiveness of t he Provant® Therapy System  
in enhancing small fiber nerve growth and function .  PEMF  treatment twice daily for 60  days was 
associated with improved skin perfusion pressure , and improved nerve conduction  velocity , 
although no consistent changes were observed in self -reported pain sc ores based on paper diaries . 
The twice daily application of PEMF was determined to be feasible and safe in subjects with DSPN.   
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEMF treatment with the 
Provant® Therapy System .   The current study focuses on pain relief and self -reported functional 
improvement as well as objective measures that may further elucidate the basic mechanisms of the 
intervention.   The current study will use electronic diaries rather than paper diaries and  include a 
larger sample size to improve the reliability and precision of the result.

3.7 Device Description   
The Provant® Therapy System is a solid -state, fixed -power output radio frequency generator 
and transmitter designed to operate at the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) 
authorized medical device frequency of 27.12 MHz.   The primary components are the 
control unit,  the treatment applicator(s) that generate and deliver the shortwave RF energy .  
Key functions and features of these components are as follows:  
3.7.1    Control Unit    
The control unit contains the main electronics, software, and user interface of the 
syste m.  The control panel (Figure below) has an LCD display which is located on the front 
of the control panel with an indicator light above the display and buttons to either side of 
31 
710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 the LCD screen.   The indicator light changes color to inform the patient alon g with the LCD 
verbiage.  The five (5) buttons are located to the right and left sides of the LCD (2 on the 
left, 3 on the right) and light up when needed. The top left button serves as a power on/off 
switch and bottom left serves as a start/stop therapy s witch.  The top right button serves as 
a pause/resume therapy during treatment.  The middle right and bottom right buttons are for 
future use and will be not be active.  
 
When the system is plugged in, the Provant Therapy System enters a “soft power” mode , 
waiting for the user to press the power on/off button.  Once the power on/off button is 
depressed, the system enters an active mode, performs some internal diagnostics to assure 
functionality, then proceeds to inform the patient to place the midfoot of each foot over each 
treatment applicator and press the start button to initiate therapy . 
Pressing the start button initiates a preset, thirty (30) -minute therapy session and treatment 
sequence described in greater detail below.   Once therapy is initiated, t he LCD screen will 
indicate the remaining time as well as the number of minutes completed. Pressing either the 
power on/off button, the therapy start/stop button or the therapy pause/resume button after 
a therapy session has started will stop the RF energy  generation.   The power on/off button 
will initiate a power down of the system.  The therapy start/stop button will initiate 
termination of the current therapy session.  The therapy pause/resume button will allow for 
pausing and continuation of a therapy s ession. All buttons have a tactile resistance and emit 
a small chirp when pressed.  
When the thirty -minute therapy session is concluded, the generation of RF energy is 
automatically terminated and an audible tone is generated to alert the user that the trea tment 
is finished.  The LCD screen then instructs the user to press the power on/off button to power 
down the system.  The patient can either store the unit or leave plugged in until the next 
use.  

32 
710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 The Provant® Therapy system also has additional functions,  independent of the user 
interface.  The system logs internally any errors encountered, start and stop times of 
treatment, as well as feedback from the treatment applicator at predefined intervals.  This 
data is stored on an internally mounted SD card (no external access) and the data can be 
read upon return of the device or can also be relayed back to the Sponsor’s engineering 
technicians through the device’s cellular module.  
In this study, the subject will treat both feet for [ADDRESS_279370] energy output is constantly 
monitored, regulated, and maintained at the preset therapy dose levels.  
Subjects randomized to active treatment will receive treatment consisting of a pulse duration 
of 42 ± 4 microseconds, repeated eve ry 1000 ± 25 microseconds, resulting in an output duty 
cycle of 4.2%, and requiring an average RF forward power level of <[ADDRESS_279371] sub -assembly.   If the RF therapy measuring circuit in the 
treatment applicator detects an abse nt or out of range therapy dosage level, treatment will 
not occur and a “Service Required” message will be displayed on the LCD screen. In such 
an event, the research center will trouble shoot the issue as instructed in the Instruction 
Manual which accompa nies the study device, and if unsuccessful in resolving the matter, 
will contact [CONTACT_231666] a replacement device.    
 
3.8 Logistics and Device Accountability   
The study device  will be shipped  via courier (FedEx) delivery or hand delivered  when 
possible  to the investigator or designee at regular  intervals or as needed during the study.  
The investigator or delegate  will ensure that all study devices are stored in a secured area, 
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
[ADDRESS_279372] or his/her family or caregiver  in the home 
or similar setting.  
The first treatmen t with the study device will be administered on the morning of the day 
following the E nrollment Visit (Day 1) at 8am (+ 2 hours). Subjects will assume a 
comfortable position , remove shoes and socks,  and place one foot on each treatment 
applicator of the PEMF device , centering the applicator s under the plantar surface (bottom 
of foot) of each foot as identified by [CONTACT_093] . Treatment will be administered  
continuously  for 30 minutes  on both feet  simultaneously . Thereafter, subjects will self -
administer treatments twice daily, at 8am  (± 2 hours) and  8pm ( ± 2 hours) up to Day 1 20 (4 
months ).  
Prior to initiation of each treatment session, the subject will place the midfoot of each foot 
over the starburst of each applicator pad.  Further directions for use for the PEMF system 
are found in the Instruction Manual .  Upon completion of the treatment session, the subject 
will store the PEMF device until the time of the next scheduled treatment session.

 3.12 Study  Assessments  
All efficacy outcome measures will be assessed in order to allow for characterization of the 
response to PEMF therapy .  
3.12.1   Primary Efficacy Assessment  
Pain Intensity (PI)  
The primary  outcome measure is the absolute change in pain intensity as measured 
by [CONTACT_231667] (NPRS) evaluations.  The NPRS is a 
validated 11 -point numerical rating scale for pain (0=no pain to 10=worst possible 
pain) collected as patient -reported outcomes in an electronic diary.  The NPRS  will 
be scored  daily ( 8am ± 2 hours)  during the 14 -day run -in period in order to 
establish a baseline for purposes of eligibility assessment.  During the subsequent 
4-month ( 120-day) treatment period, NPRS  will be scored  immediately after each 
morning treatment session ( 8am ± 2 hours) .  
 
Subjects will be instructed to “Select the one number that best indicates the 
average intensity of pain you have had over the last 24 hours in your legs”. 
 
The primary endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in the NPRS Pain score 
through Month 4 ( Day 1 20) comparing the P EMF  group to the sham group.  For 
purposes of statistical analysis, the baseline NPRS  will be the average NPRS  
during the 7 days preceding  the start of treatment with the study device.  For 
subsequent time points, including the primary endpoint at Day 1 20, NPRS  will be 
calculated as  7-day rolling average s during the treatment period .   
During Part B of the protocol (through Month 12 (day 360)), NPRS will be scored 
immediately after each morning treatment session ( 8am ± 2 hours)  for one week 
prior to Months 6, 8, 10, and 12 . Evaluation of the NPRS during Part B of the 
protocol will be considered an exploratory endpoint.  
 
3.12.2   Secondary  Efficacy Assessments  
NeuroQoL  
The NeuroQoL is a validated 29 question assessment tool that measures the effects 
of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its complications on an individual’s quality of 
life. Subjects are asked about the effect their foot problems may have on their daily 
life and well -being in the past 4 weeks, with “foot problems” meaning lost or 
reduced feeling in the lower extremities, pain discomfort, and in some cases 
unsteadiness while walking or standing.  The questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_941] 
[ADDRESS_279374] at the Enrollment Visit, Month 2, Month 4 , Month 8, and Month 12  visit 
(Day 361).   
 
Skin Perfusion Pressure  
Vasamed Sensilase PAD -IQ measures the perfusion  pressure (in mmH g) of 
microcirculation using a laser Doppler sensor.   SPP uses the reactive hyperemia to 
assess capi[INVESTIGATOR_231647].  Two previous trials were conducted 
in patients with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy showing an increase in 
circulation (pressure) from baseline.   
 
The p atient lies down in supi[INVESTIGATOR_231648].  The Laser 
Sensor Assembly (LSA) is inserted into the LSA Placement Guide and the optical 
sensor window is oriented toward the skin  on the foot .  A cuff is positioned so that 
the LSA is centered on the bladder both horizontally and vertically. The pressure of 
the cuff is then automatically increased to a pressure necessary to occlude blood 
flow and then released at a controlled rate and a measurement of the pressure in the 
angiosome is made.  Skin Perfus ion Pressure - SPP is the pressure required for 
restoring microcirculatory blood flow following release of carefully controlled 
occlusion.  Two measurements are obtained  per foot ; one on the dorsal aspect of 
each foot in the distribution of the dorsalis ped is artery angiosome and on the plantar 
aspect of each foot in the distribution of the lateral plantar artery angiosome.   SPP 
will be conducted at the Enrollment Visit  to obtain a baseline value and at months 
2, and 4.  An increase in SPP would be considere d clinically meaningful.  
 
Sural Nerve Conduction Studies  (NCS) 
Sural Nerve Conduction Studies  (NCS) assess large myelinated axons.  Using the 
NC-stat® DPNCheck®, the subject will assume a comfortable position so that their 
right or left leg is visible (that the subject’s outer ankle bone and Achilles tendon are 
visible).  The patient preparation pad is then used to thoroughly clean the subject’s 
outer lower leg and ankle bone area to remove any residue.  The subject’s lateral 
malleolar (ankle) bone is t hen identified to align the anode and cathode just behind 
with the cathode just adjacent to the middle of the ankle bone.  The device is aligned 
on the calf pressing firmly down on the foam to ensure contact [CONTACT_231668].  The sural nerve con duction velocity and amplitude will be recorded.  The test 
will then be repeated on the opposite leg.  NC S will be collected at the Enrollment 
Visit to obtain a baseline value and at Day s 121 (month 4)  and 361 (month 12).  An 
increase in velocity and/or an  increase in amplitude would suggest DPN 
improvement.

710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)  
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) for thermal sensation assesses small diameter 
unmyelinated and lightly myelinated axons .  QST is a noninvasive  technique 
provid ing an easy to use, validated measure of warm, cool, and heat pain thermal 
sensory thresholds.    
The Thermal Stimulator is placed on the  surface of the skin on the dorsal aspect of 
the foot.  The Thermal Stimulator is held in place on the foot by a Velcro str ap, 
which wraps around the subject’s foot.   
Contact [CONTACT_231669]. Q-Sense  
system .  A Thermal Stimulator probe (“thermode”) is placed on the surface of the 
skin on the dorsal aspect of the foot in the distribution of the superficial branch of 
the distal fibular (peroneal) nerve.    The probe is held in place by a Velcro strap, 
which wraps around the subject’s foot.  Using a Patient Response Unit (PRU), the 
subject presses a button to identify their response to the delivered thermal 
stimulation.   This is done by [CONTACT_231670] 
(CS), warm sensation thres hold (WS) and heat pain threshold (HP) modalities 
using the method of Limits.  Within the cool and warm sensation modalities, the 
trial is repeated [ADDRESS_279375]’s ability to determine when a stimulus begins to 
feel painful, not hot , in order  to develop a pain perception profile.    At any point 
during testing,  the subject can choose to discontinue further testing of the heating 
stimuli.   The entire study will last between [ADDRESS_279376] will be performed at the Enrollment Visit to obtain a baseline value and at the 
Day 121 Visit (Month 4) , Day 240 Visit ( Month 8) , and Day 361 Visit (Month 
12).  
Patient Global Impression (PGI)  
PGI is a [ADDRESS_279377]’s interpretation of their 
painful diabetic neuropathy as well as overall health on an 11 -point numerical rating 
scale (NRS). PGI allows subjects to integrate, into three questions their overall 
evalua tion of their status, the different aspects of their overall diabetic neuropathy 
in their legs, overall health, and overall status compared to the start of the study. It 
is important to note that a n 11-point global scale is common and considered a valid 
37 
710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 approach; however, the specific wording for the questionnaire in this trial has not 
been validated.  
In the first question, subjects will be asked to circle the number on an [ADDRESS_279378] week (“How would you rate the overall status of your diabetic neuropathy 
in your legs over the past week?”).  Subjects are then asked to circle the number on 
an [ADDRESS_279379] week (“How 
was your overall health over the past week?”).  The third question assesses change 
since the start of the study on a 7 -point scale (“Since the start of the study, how has 
your diabetic neuropathy in your legs changed?”), and to score it as ei ther very much 
worse, much worse, minimally worse, no change, minimally improved, much 
improved or very much improved. PGI will be collected in the clinic at Months 1, 2, 
3, and [ADDRESS_279380] changes in overall status 
during the course of treatment.  
 
3.12.3  Exploratory Efficacy Assessment  
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem  
The Work Producti vity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAIQ) is a 
validated [ADDRESS_279381] at the Enrollment Visit, Month 2, and Month 4. 
Biopsy    
Two 3 mm punch skin biops ies will be  performed  at baseline and end of treatment  
to assess IENFD .  At the Enrollment Visit, o ne biopsy will  be obtained at the distal 
leg, 10  cm above the lateral malleolus on the  right  leg and a  second biopsy will be 
obtained at the distal thigh, 10  cm above the superior margin of the patella on the 
lateral right leg.  The biops ies will be shipped overnight to the University of Utah 
Cutaneous Nerve Laboratory .  At the end of Part A study visit  Month 4  (Day 121), 
a second set of biops ies will be obtained lateral to the baseline biopsies and 
shipped overnight to the central lab .  Subjects who do not consent to skin biopsies 
may still be enrolled in the stud y.  Subjects that did not consent to or have biopsies 
at the Baseline Visit may still have biops ies collected at Month 4 as they enter into 
the open label extension period.  At the end of Part B study visit Month 12 (Day 
38 
710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 361), a final set of biopsies will be obtained lateral to the Month 4 biopsies and 
shipped overnight to the central lab.  
NOTE: Skin bi opsies will not be performed in subjects receiving anticoagulants.  
Biopsies may be performed on subjects receiving anti -platelet therapy (i.e. non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory medications, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) according to clinical 
judgment.    
3.12.4  Additional S tudy Assessments  
Measuremen t of Ankle -Brachial Index (ABI)   
Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) compares pressures in the brachial arteries to lower 
extremity pressures in the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries as measured 
with doppler ultrasound.  The ra tio between these pressures is the ABI.  Subject s 
should be  in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], with the arms and legs at the same level as the heart 
for a minimum of 10 minutes before obtaining  the ABI measurement.  ABI will be 
measured at the Screening Visit on both sides.  For subjects that consented to having 
biopsies collected,  ABI measurements will be taken before the biopsies are 
collected.    
Venous Insufficiency  
Venous insufficiency will be graded by [CONTACT_231671]34 below:

710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS)  
The Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) is a validated and quantitative 
instrument  to evaluate the severity of peripheral neuropathy  in the lower extremities . 
The scoring system is broken out into 3 elements of Reflex, Symptom, and Sensory.  
Each patient is assessed as to the presence or absence of symptom, reflex, or 
sensation on each foot.  The outcome, the clinical neuropathy score, is a continuous 
variable ranging from a minimum of 0 (no neuropathy) to a maximum of 19 points 
(0-5 points no neuropathy, 6 -8 points mild neuropathy, 9 -11 points moderate 
neuropathy, and 12+ severe neuropathy).  The Toronto Clinical Scoring System will  
be used as a screening assessment for inclusion at the Screening Visit and measured 
at the Day 121 visit (Month 4 ) and Day 361 Visit (Month 12) .  
Measurement of Foot Thickness   
The depth of the foot (H  below ) will be measured from the most inferior aspect of 
the medial malleolus to the plantar aspect of the foot when residing on the floor ( see 
diagram b elow) .  The depth should not be more than 8cm for inclusion in the trial 
for optimal treatment penetration . 
 
 
The width (widest portion) and length (heel to the tip of the longest toe) of the foot 
will also be measured in centimeters using a tape  measuring device . The shoe size 
will be obtained using the Brannock Foot Measuring Device.  
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Test  
Hemoglobin A1c provides the average level of glucose in the blood over the past [ADDRESS_279382], the A1C Now® System will be used, subjects will have a finger stick to collect 
5µL of blood to obtain the A1c value at the Screening Visit to o btain eligibility .  At the end 
of the study , Month 4 (Day 121) the A1c will be collected and compared to the baseline 
Floor  
[ADDRESS_279383] a A1C Now® System assigned to them.  The change from 
baseline will be captured and assessed.    
 
Subject adherence   
Compliance with twice daily treatment with the study device will be as sessed verbally 
during the Day 7  telephone cal l, at the interim visits and upon completion of the study.  Data 
on the usage of each device is collected in real time at Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  The 
report will contain  the patient ’s device  treatment information  and will be sent to the site at 
regular  intervals.  The site will assess compliance based on the report and contact [CONTACT_231672].  The site will also review 
compliance with the subject a t each of the interim visits .   
 
Treatment Satisfaction  and Blinding Assessment  
Treatment satisfaction with the device will be obtained at Months 1, 2, 3, e nd of Part A 
study visit (Month 4), and at Month s [ADDRESS_279384] will be asked “How satisfied are you with the 
Investigational  Treatment ?” and will choose between Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Neither 
Satisfied or Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, and Very Dissatisfied .    
Subjects will also be asked which device (active o r sham) they believe they were 
randomized to at the Day 7 phone call and Month 4 (Day 121) (blinding assessment).  
 
3.12.5  Safety  Assessments

 7. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
The statistical analysis plan for this  study will be  described in detail in a separate Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP).   The initial phase of this study is defined as Part A  and represents the randomized 
double -blind portion of the study. Part B is the open -label extension phase where all subjects will 
receive active therapy.    
The primary population for assessing efficacy and safety will be the  Intent to Treat (ITT) Analysis  
Set, defined as all subjects who were enrolled into the study and issued a study device.  
A secondary analysis of the individual efficacy endpoints will be conducted usi ng the Per Protocol 
(PP) Analysis Set , defined as all subjects who were enrolled and c ompleted ≥70% use in treating 
with the study device.   
Subjects will complete a [ADDRESS_279400] will be enrolled and randomized 1:[ADDRESS_279401] number, visit date and 
relative study day.  Listings will also include the number of days relative to the initiation of 
treatment.  Summary tabulations  will be created  for all rand omized subjects who complete the 
baseline and study day 120 evaluations ( Completers Analysis Set ), and all randomized subjects 
using the baseline and last recorded set of evaluations ( End of Study Evaluation Set ).  This latter set 
should include all subjec ts who were randomized and complete at least one set of evaluations after 
randomization.   
Specific algorithms will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan for imputing missing or 
partially missing dates, if deemed appropriate, under specific data to pi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  Imputed or derived data 
will be flagged in the individual subject data listings.  Imputed data will not be incorporated into 
any raw or primary datasets.  The imputed data will be retained in the derived / analysis datasets.  
The total duration for a  subject on-study  will be calculated as the difference between the date of 
initial study treatment and the last day of observation plus 1 day.  All calculations for defining the 
duration on -study will follow the algorithm DURATION = [STUDY COMPLETION OR 
WITHDRAW DATE – INITIAL TREATMENT DATE +  1].   
[ADDRESS_279402] of the count and percentage in each level for categorical variables, 
and the sample size (n) mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values 
for continuous variables.  Pairwise differences between the trea tment groups will be calculated and 
95% confidence intervals constructed. Time to event analysis will be determined through Kaplan 
Meier analysis and log -rank testing.  
All summary tables will include the analysis population sample size (i.e., number of sub jects).  
Study Day [ADDRESS_279403] active study 
treatment.   
The primary endpoint for the study is the change from baseline in the NPRS score at 4 months . 
The primary hypothesis to be tested is presented below:  
Ho: µ (Change in NPRS score at 4 months  / PEMF group) = µ (Change in NPRS score at 4 months 
/ sham group)  
Ha: µ (Change in NPRS score at 4 months / PEMF group) ≠ µ (Change in NPRS score at 4 months 
/ sham group)  
To compare the absolute change in pain from baseline to 4-months, the intra -patient change will be 
calculated and serve as the dependent variable in the analysis.  The baseline pain score will be 
introduced in the model as a covariate.  Clinical site will be added to the model to assess poolability 
of the data a cross sites.  Interaction between clinical site and treatment will be evaluated using a 
type 1 error rate of 10%.    
 
Mixed Models with Repeated Measures (MMRM) comparing results across all time -points will 
also be performed, adjusted for the baseline value, week, treatment by [CONTACT_231680].  
Sub-group analysis will be pre -specified in the SAP and will be performed on subjects with pain 
scores ≥ [ADDRESS_279404] non -missing weekly mean pain intensity 
score will also be provided.  
The pattern mixture model methodology will be implemented using SAS procedures MI and 
MIANALYZE. Specifically, the following steps will be followed:  
• Inter mittent missing data will first be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) method implemented with the SAS MI procedure, which is appropriate for non -
monotonic missing data.  
Data for patients who discontinues early will be multiply imputed as fo llows:  
• If the patient discontinues due to an AE lack of response, then missing data will be assumed 
to follow a distribution similar to the baseline values observed in the patient’s randomized 
treatment.  
• If the patient discontinues due to reasons other th an AE or treatment response, at each time 
point, missing data will be assumed to follow a distribution similar to scores for patients 
that are still in the study and randomized to the same treatment group.  
Results of the 120-day results, and the MMRM using  the multiply imputed data, will be summarized 
using the SAS MIANALYZE procedure.  
A hierarchical approach will be undertaken for the pre -specified secondary outcomes. Testing will 
occur in the listed sequence following testing of the primary endpoint.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_279405] of Clinical Sites  
This is a multi -center clinical study, with standardization of patient  enrollment, data entry, and 
adverse event reporting. All clinical sites will follow the requirements of the use of the device , data 
collection procedures, diaries and case report forms. To present the data from this clinical study in 
a summarized  form, a comparison of the primary endpoint results across clinical sites will be 
performed  to determine if the response among sites is  consistent. Small sites (i.e., sites that have 
less than 6 patient s) will be identified and the following method will be used for combining the 
data.  Data from all small sites (<6 patients ) will be combined to form a single site in order to 
obviate non -estimable estimates  in the evaluation of site and site interaction effects. Once 
combined, the pooled site will remain in the model  for all analyses where  a site effect is to be 
determined. If the pooled smaller sites represent a single site that has more t han twice as many 
patient s as the largest single site, however less than 3 times as many patient s, the small sites will be 
ranked by [CONTACT_231681] 2 pooled assignments using an alternating sequence (ABABAB).  
If the pooled smaller sites represent a  site that has more than three times as many patient s as the 
largest single site, however less than four times as many patient s, the small sites will be ranked by 
[CONTACT_231681] 3 pooled assignments using an alternating sequence (ABCABCABC).  
[ADDRESS_279406] of 
homogeneity comparing the proportions of patient s with a positive outcome  for the endpoints across 
clinical sites; a p -value less than 0. 1 will be considered evi dence of non -poolability.  Even with the 
absence of statistical significance , sites with substantial difference s in clinical outcomes will be 
thoroughly investigated.  
 
7.3 Adverse Events  
All summaries of adverse events will be based on treatment -emergent adverse events.  Adverse 
events will be provided in a listing .  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing adverse 
events will be summarized. Summaries by [CONTACT_231682] 
(active or sham) will also be provided. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading to 
discont inuation from the study will be presented.  Treatment -related adverse events will be defined 
as adverse events with investigator assessment of related or possibly related.  In summaries of 
adverse events by [CONTACT_132628], patien ts reporting multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_231652], respectively.  Serious 
adverse events will also be presented by [CONTACT_72843]. The number of patients with at 
least one adverse event w ill be tabulated for each treatment group.  The number of adverse events 
for each treatment group will also be tabulated.   
7.4 Sample Size   
This is a Phase III  study with a sample size of 1 70 patients  (85 per treatment group) .  The sample 
size for the trial has been set at 170. Based on a previously conducted clinical trial assessing the 
efficacy and  safety of the Provant Therapy System in a similar population, the mean ± standard 
deviation change in the NPRS from baseline to 60 days was 1.79 ± 1.[ADDRESS_279407] of 40% results in an assumed between group difference of 
1.07 units.   Based on alpha = 0.05 and 90% power, a sample size of [ADDRESS_279408] for the NPRS.  A total sample size of 
162 was estimated based on an assumed premature discontinuation rate of 30%.  
 
8.  INFORMED CONSENT  
It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093] (if acceptabl e 
by [CONTACT_427]), to obtain written informed consent from all subjects  prior to participating in 
this study . The original informed consent from  will be filed in the Investigat or Site File.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent 
form will be reviewed and updated if necessary.  All subject s (including those already being treated) 
will be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form and be re -consent ed to 
continue in the study.  
[ADDRESS_279409]  
(such as subjec t information  sheets or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) as 
well as any advertising or compensation given to the subject , will be submitted by [CONTACT_231683]’s designee to an IRB.  Approval from the IRB must be obtained before starting the 
study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the IRB 
met and granted the approval.  
10. TERMINATION  OF THE INVESTIGATIO N 
As the study sponsor, Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  reserves the right to terminate the study at any 
time.  Should early termination be necessary, Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  and the investigator  will 
consult and make sure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of subject s’ interests.  
Additiona lly, all clinical investigational data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_231684] a regular basis.  
Reports of all data will be made available to the Institutional Review Boards and to the FDA  as 
required .  Unanticipated adverse device  events will be evaluated and  reported in accordance with 
21 CFR Part 812 requirements and as required by [CONTACT_114021].  
The clinical investigation will be suspended if the investigator or the sponsor , upon review and 
evaluation of the clinical data, finds the severity or incidence of single or total adverse events  
unacceptable for continuation of the investigation.  
11. ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED ADVERS E DEVICE EFFECTS  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adv erse event is defined as follows:   Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation patient administered a medical device treatment which does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.   An AE can therefor e be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly 
associated with the use of study  device  treatment, whether or not considered related to the study  
device .   
All AEs occurring after signing of the consent form will be recorded. AEs arising subsequent to the 
time of initiation of first trea tment with study  device  will be considered treatment emergent AEs .   
At each contact [CONTACT_1155] , the investigator or designee must seek information on AEs by [CONTACT_105]-
leading specific questioning and, as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].   All observed or volunteered AEs, 
regardless of suspected causal relationship to study device, must be recorded in the pati ent’s chart . 
Any events involving illnesses or injuries with onset during the study or any events involving 
exacerbations of pre -existing illnesses should be recorded.   All clearly related signs and symptoms 
should be grouped together and recorded as a sin gle diagnosis in the patient’s chart .  A pre -existing 
condition must not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens during the trial.      
55 
710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 Each AE will be independently judged by [CONTACT_231685] .  The following 
definitions will  be used for these causality assessments.  
Related:            This causal relationship is assigned when the AE:  
• starts a reasonable time after study device administration,  
• cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:   This causal relationship is assigned when the AE:  
• starts a reasonable time after study device administration, but  
• could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical state or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
Unrelated:        This causal r elationship is assigned when the AE:  
• is definitely not associated with the study device administered 
and is readily explained by [CONTACT_231686].  
Each AE will also be independently judged by [CONTACT_231687] .  The following 
definitions will be used for these severity  assessments.  
Mild :           The event is transient (<48 hours)  or causes mild discomfort; no 
medical intervention/therapy is required  
Moderate :  The event results in mild to moderate limitation in activity – some 
assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy is required  
Severe :       The event results in marked limitation in activity, assistance is 
usually required; medical intervention/therapy is required and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231653] .  A serious 
adverse event ( SAE ) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death, or  
• Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requi res inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structu re,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
56 
710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 • Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude any one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition . 
All SAEs must be reported  immediately  (within 24 hours of knowledge of the event) by [CONTACT_231688] : 
   FAX: 480 -907-1292  
   Attention: Medical Monitor  
 
The investigator  will follow up with a written description of the SAE submitted to the sponsor 
within 3 days, including the results of the SAE investigation and any treatment(s) provided.  
All adverse events will be followed until resolution or until the investigator asse sses the subject’s  
status has returned to normal.  
11.2 Anticipated  Adverse Device Effects Associated with Provant  Therapy System   
Anticipated adverse events associated with PROVANT® Therapy System  are as follows:  
• Skin Reaction in the application area (i.e.  rash, erythema)  
• Altered sensatio n in the treatment area (i.e. burning, paresthesia ) 
• Hyperalgesia in the application area  (i.e. increased pain, hypersensitivity)  
 
11.[ADDRESS_279410] (UADE)  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol or 
informed consent form , or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects .  The protocol  will contain all of the anticipated 
Adverse Eve nts that could be associated with the study.  
All UADE s must be reported  immediately  (within 24 hours of knowledge of the event) by [CONTACT_231689]:  
Regenesis Biomedical, Inc. Fax: (480) 907 -1292 The investigator  will follow up with a written 
description of the UADE  submitted to the sponsor within 3 days , including the results of the UADE 
investigation and any treatment(s) provided.  
Any UADE  occurring up to the date of the final Follow -up Visit will be followed u ntil it resolves, 
the investigator assesses the subject’s  status to have returned to baseline, or until the investigator 
feels that the event is stable and chronic.  
The investigator shall submit to the reviewing IRB a report of any UADE occurring during an  
investigation as soon as possible in accordance with the IRB submission guidelines, but in no event 
later than [ADDRESS_279411].

710-7105 -01 C RBI.2017.002  Version C CONFIDENTIAL  
 12. INVESTIGATOR’S  FILES/RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to 
be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should be 
classified into two different separate categories (1) Investig ator’s Study File, and (2) Subject  
clinical source documents. The Investigator’s Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, 
data collection forms , Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and governmental 
approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, device records, staff curriculum vitae and 
authorization forms and other appropriate documents/correspondence. All records defined  in [ADDRESS_279412]  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s 
notes, appointment book, original lab reports, special assessment reports, signed informed consent 
forms, subject  screening and enrollment logs.   
The investigator  must keep these two categories of document s on file for at least [ADDRESS_279413] of the following: completion, discontinuation of the study, or the regulatory submission for 
which the study is being performed is no longer under review.  After that period of time the 
documents may be destr oyed, subject  to local regulations.  
Should the investigator  wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, Regenesis  Biomedical, Inc.  must be notified in advance.  
If the investigator  cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site for any or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator  and Regenesis  
Biomedical, Inc.  to store these in a sealed container(s) off-site so that the y can be returned sealed 
to the investigator  in case of a regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required for the 
continued care of the subject , appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_231654].  
12.[ADDRESS_279414] with any required background data   
from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly important when data 
requires clarification .  In case of special problems/and or governmental  queries or requests 
for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, 
provided that subject  confidentiality is protected.   
All forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink, and must be legible.  Errors 
should be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed 
and dated by [CONTACT_15009]/her authorized delegate.

13. MONITORING THE STUDY  
It is understood that the responsible Regenesis  Biomedical, Inc.  monitor (or designee) will contact 
[CONTACT_231690], upon request, to inspect the various records 
of the trial ( source documents and other pertinent data) provided that subject  confidentiality is 
maintained in accord with local requirements.  
It will be the monitor’s responsibility to inspect the patient charts  at regular intervals t hroughout 
the study to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and accuracy of 
the data.  The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports and other subject  records needed.  
The investigator (or his/her designee ) agr ees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
14. CONFIDENTIALITY OF T RIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT  RECORDS  
The investigator must assure that subject s’ anonymity will be maintaine d and that their identities 
are protected from unauthorized parties.  On documents submitted to the sponsor, subject s should 
not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_1209].  The investigator should keep a 
subject  enrollment log showing codes, names and addresses.  The investigator should maintain 
documents not for submission to Regenesis Biomedical, Inc. , e.g., subject s’ written consent forms, 
in strict confidence.  
15. PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TR ADE S ECRETS  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, 
the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  at least 
[ADDRESS_279416] editorial and ethical practice, Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  will gener ally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In 
this case, a coordinating investigat or will be designated by [CONTACT_11402].  Any formal 
publication of the study in which input of Regenesis Bio medical, Inc.  personnel exceeded that of 
conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by [CONTACT_231691], Inc.  personnel.  Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_231692].

OF DIABETES  
 
FPG ≥ 126mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours*  
OR 
2-hour PG ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT. The test should be performed as described by 
[CONTACT_14300], using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 -g anhydrous glucose dissolved in 
water. *  
OR 
A1C ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is 
NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay. *  
OR 
In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma 
glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).  
*In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, results should be confirmed by [CONTACT_15013].

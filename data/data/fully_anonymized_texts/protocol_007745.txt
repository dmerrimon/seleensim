Completed by       [CONTACT_522429] 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677587] severe back pain, often 
with associated neurological problems, which can further compromise their performance status. 
 
 The main presenting symptom of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522245]. Therefore, the primary goal of 
radiosurgery for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522246] (relief). The treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522247]. Although the most common regimen of 
radiotherapy has been 30 Gy in 10 fractions, the radiation dose-pain response has not been well 
settled. An early RTOG study for bone metastasis reported that low-dose short course 
radiotherapy was as effective as a high dose protracted regimen (Tong 1982). Recently, RTOG 
97-14, which randomized the treatment of bone metastasis between a single dose of 8 Gy and 10 
fractions of 3 Gy for a total dose of 30 Gy, also showed a similar result. However, the duration 
and rate of pain control of bone metastases was limited by [CONTACT_522430] (Hartsell 2005). In a subgroup of patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_522248], only 61% of patients experienced partial or complete pain relief at [ADDRESS_677588]-treatment. 
Recently, there has been an increasing trend of diagnosing more localized spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278] (i.e., 
oligometastases), although the true incidence of solitary spi[INVESTIGATOR_522249]. These 
patients may have a prolonged survival time. Therefore, there is pressing need to improve the 
pain control of patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278], which may be connected to an improvement i n 
quality of life. 
 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_522250], there have been few prospective studies 
for this large group of patients (Greenberg 1980; Young 1980; Maranzano 1995; Helweg-Larsen 
1996; Patchell 2005). It is evident, from these studies, that a single dose of 8-[ADDRESS_677589], but also accurate treatment planning and delivery. 
 
1.2 Radiosurgery/SBRT of Localized Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522251], immobilization, and dosimetric characteristics of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522252] (Yin 2002; Yin 2002b). The first approach to establish clinical feasibility was to 
determine the accuracy and precision of radiosurgery to treat the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522253]/paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_522254]. Th is clinical study demonstrated targeting accuracy 
within 1.5 mm for actual patient treatment (Ryu 2003). The accuracy of radiosurgical targeting for 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_522255] (Ho 2007; Yin 2008 ).  
 
 Subsequent clinical experience with single dose radiosurgery for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522256]. In these studies, there was rapid pain relief reported with a median time to 
pain relief of only 2 weeks, with pain control seen in some patients as early as within 24 hours 
(Ryu 2003; Gertzen 2005; Degen 2005;  Ryu 2004). Median duration of pain control in the treated 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_522257] 13.3 months (Ryu 2008). Other investigators also demonstrated similar results 
of pain control in patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_424381] (Gertzen 2005; Degen 2005; Gertzen 2006; 
Gertzen 2005b). Quality of life also was improved secondary to pain contr ol (Degen 2005). Local 
tumor control at the treated spi[INVESTIGATOR_522258] 95% of the patients. Recurrence at the 
immediately adjacent vertebrae was less than 5% (Ryu 2004). Patients with oligometastasis had 
a longer survival with more effective local treatment of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424381] (Ryu 2007 ). This 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677590] compression  showed that thecal sac patency was 
achieved in 82% of patients by [CONTACT_522431][INVESTIGATOR_522259] (Ryu 
2008c ). 
 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522260]-limiting critical organ at risk is a key concern. Because of the nature of 
radiosurgery with rapid dose fall-off, there is a radiation dose gradient within the diameter of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. The result of accumulated dose volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522261] [ADDRESS_677591] of 
10 Gy to the 10% cross-sectional area of the cord, provided that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522262] 6 
mm above and below the radiosurgery target volume (Ryu 2007). Other investigators used 
slightly different criteria of defining the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522263] : these were a max imum dose of 12- [ADDRESS_677592] (Chang 2007) or a maximum 
dose of [ADDRESS_677593] (Yamada 2008). Taken together, these dose 
criteria were in a similar range. Therefore, we chose to use the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522264] 10 Gy to 
10 % of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522265] a maximum of 6 mm above and below the radiosurgery target. 
 
1.3 Selection of Radiosurgery Dose (8/30/11) 
 A radiation dose-response relationship for pain control has not been established. However, there 
is a trend for a radiation dose-pain control relationship when all the studies are compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]. A recent 
meta-analysis of ten randomized trials containing single fraction radiotherapy for painful bone 
metastasis showed single-fraction radiation (median 8 Gy, range 8-10 Gy) achieved a complete 
pain response of 33.4%, and an overall response rate of 62.1% (Wu 2003). Large scale clinical 
trials using single fraction radiation doses of 8 Gy resulted in similar pain control of bone 
metastasis (Hartsell 2005; Bone Pain Trial Working Party 1999; Steenland  1999 ). Therefore, the 
phase III portion  of this tria l will use either 8 Gy as the prescribing radiation dose ; 3-dimensional 
conformal beam arrangement is also allowed per the treating physician’s discretion.  
  
 Radiosurgery experiences recently have been reported with a single fraction of higher radiation 
doses for spi[INVESTIGATOR_158444]. The majority of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522266]. Although the results cannot be directly compared to each other, 
these results suggest a trend towards a higher overall pain control with higher radiation dos es 
(Ryu 2003; Ryu 2004; Gertzen 2006; Gertzen 2005b). There is no threshold dose that can be 
firmly stated. Based on the Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_522267] 
10 Gy to 20 Gy in 2 Gy increments, there was a strong trend for increasing pain relief with higher 
radiation doses, particularly when a dose ≥ 16 Gy was employed (Ryu 2008; Ryu 2007).While 
there was no statistically significant difference, the sample size may have been the main limiting 
issue to detect a statistical difference in the dose-response analysis.  When the radiosurgery 
dose was ≥ 16 Gy, the probability of pain relief was reached in over 80% of the patients. The 
experience of the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_522268] a 
median dose ≥ 16 Gy (Gerzten 2005; Gertzen 2005b; Gertzen 2006). Therefore, the phase III 
component of this study will use [ADDRESS_677594] constraint is 10 Gy to 
the 10% partial spi[INVESTIGATOR_522269] (spi[INVESTIGATOR_522265] a maximum of 6 mm above and below 
the target volume) [Ryu 2007].  
 
Additional experience of radiosurgery with higher doses for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522270] a 
higher (than 16 Gy) radiosurgery dose w as required to achieve similar pain relief, particularly in 
radioresistant tumors including soft tissue sarcoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma as well 
as other tumors. (Gerszten 2005c; Nguyen 2010, Yamada 2008). Therefore, the phase III 
component of this study will use a radiosurgical dose of 16 Gy or 18 Gy per treating physician’s 
discretion and institutional experience. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been defined in 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_158311], as the MTD of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522271]. In this clinical trial, the proposed 
prescription doses are readily achievable with the defined spi[INVESTIGATOR_522272] 1.2 and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
1.4 Advantages of Image-Guided Radiosurgery (8/30 /11) 
 The potential advantages of using image-guided radiosurgery for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522273]. 
First, pain control is rapid and durable. Second, since only the involved spi[INVESTIGATOR_522274], bone 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677595], radiosurgery is a non- 
invasive treatment; it has the potential to reduce the necessity of invasive open surgery in these 
patients. The non-invasiveness and shortened treatment time provided by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_522275]/or neurological deficits. Thus, it is anticipated that in the future image-guided 
radiosurgery may become a standard of care to treat localized spi[INVESTIGATOR_522276]. Indeed, as this technology is becoming so widely available, this clinical 
trial is critical to avoid both under-utilization and over-utilization of this emerging technique.   
 
 It is important to first study this emerging technique of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522277] a phase II trial within 
a national cooperative group. This phase II study will assess the experience of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522278], which is the optimum forum to test and develop a new 
radiotherapeutic technology. Once the single arm phase II component is completed and the 
efficacy of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522279], the phase III component will proceed to determine 
whether spi[INVESTIGATOR_522280]. The phase III component will randomize patients to directly compare a 
single dose of external beam radiation (8 Gy) versus SBRT given in one fraction (16 Gy or 18 
Gy). The result will indeed demonstrate whether or not there is radiation dose-response in pain 
control of bone metastasis. 
 
1.5 Hypothesis (8/30/11) 
 I n the prior RTOG study for bone metastases, 97-14, the duration and rate of pain control of bone 
metastases was limited by [CONTACT_522432] (single dose of 8 Gy or 10 fractions of 3 Gy 
for a total dose of 30 Gy) [Hartsell 200 5]. Although previous results defined partial pain relief as 
an improvement of ≥ 2 points, the current trial will define partial pain relief as an improvement of 
 ≥ [ADDRESS_677596]-treatment score of 0. Both partial and complete pain relief require no increase 
in narcotic medication. In RTOG 97-14, 253 patients (29% of total) were treated to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The 
pain response rate was 51% at 3 months in these patients.  
 
 T he goal  of the phase II component of th is study is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of 
treating spi[INVESTIGATOR_522281]-guided radiosurgery/SBRT in the NRG Oncology setting. 
Treatment compliance will be evaluated according to the radiosurgery guidelines (see Section 
6.0). Based on the RTOG experience of treating lung cancer with SBRT, the target rate for 
successful treatment delivery is 85% of patients successfully treated with SBRT for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522282].  
 
The hypothesis of the phase III component, in which patients will be randomized to image-guided 
radiosurgery/SBRT in a single fraction dose of 16 or 18 Gy (experimental arm) OR conventional 
external beam radiotherapy in a single dose of 8 Gy (control arm based on the RTOG 97- 14 
results) is that image-guided radiosurgery/SBRT wil l result in a 40% improvement (from 51% to 
70%) in the proportion of patients experiencing pain relief at 3 months as compared to the 
external beam radiotherapy. Patients randomized to Arm 1 (experimental arm) will be stratified 
according to the single fraction dose for image-guided radiosurgery/SBRT, using either 16 or 18 
Gy as preferred by [CONTACT_1963]. 
 
1.6 Primary Endpoint: Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) (8/30/11) 
1.6.1  The primary endpoint is pain control at the treated site(s) at [ADDRESS_677597]-treatment is considered a failure.  For evaluation 
of pain relief, the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (Jensen 1999) will be used. The NRPS is a 
simple measure of pain on an 11-point scale (0-10). In the study comparing the reliability and 
validity of several measures of pain intensity, the composites of 0-[ADDRESS_677598] been shown 
to be useful when maximal reliability was necessary in studies with relatively small sample 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 4 sizes or in clinical settings in which monitoring of changes in pain intensity in individuals is 
needed.  
1.6.2  Scoring Pain   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Solitary Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522283].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiple Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522284], the index spi[INVESTIGATOR_522285]. The index spi[INVESTIGATOR_522286].  If a patient has > [ADDRESS_677599] cephalad of these lesions. For example, for a patient who has 3 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_522287]:  1) C5 lesion with pain score of 4; 2) T2-3 lesion with pain score 
of 6; and 3) T12 lesion with pain score of 6.  The index lesion in this case would be T2- [ADDRESS_677600] pain score.  
If, however, the same patient had a pretreatment score at T12 of 7 (and the rest of the 
scores remained the same), the T12 lesion would be the index lesion. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Type of Tumor  
The stratification between radioresistant tumors and other tumors is due to the similarity of 
their expected responses. Radioresistant tumors include soft tissue sarcoma, melanoma, 
and renal cell carcinoma. It has been shown that these types of tumors, specifically 
melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, appear to have similar responses compared to any 
other tumor (Gerszten 2005 (c); Nguyen 2010).  Thus, these types of tumors are eligible for 
the study treatment but will be stratified among the treatment groups to not bias the results. 
1.6.3  Definition of Pain Response 
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete pain relief is defined as a pain score of [ADDRESS_677601]-
treatment. Complete pain relief is based on no increase in narcotic pain medication. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Partial pain relief is defined as a reduction in the numerical pain score of ≥ 3 (i.e., an 
improvement of at least 3 points from the baseline NRPS) at the index site, as long as none 
of the other treated lesions have increased in pain score and as long as the patient did not 
require an increase in the level of narcotic pain medication. Patients who require an increase 
in narcotic pain medication will not be scored as having partial pain relief, even if their pain 
score has improved by [CONTACT_2669] 3 points on the scoring system. (Note: If a patient can only 
give one pain score for all sites, this score will be used for all treated sites at that time point, 
and the most cephalad lesion will be defined as the index lesion). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stable response is defined as a post-treatment pain score the same as or within 2 points of 
the baseline pain score at the index site with no increase in narcotic pain medication. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Progressive response is defined as a post-treatment increase of at least 3 points from the 
baseline pain score at the index site. 
1.6.4  Evaluation of Pain Response 
 Complete or partial pain relief or a stable response at the index site requires no increase in 
narcotic pain medication and excludes progressive response at the secondary treated site(s). 
Although complete pain relief is the best outcome, partial relief also is a satisfactory outcome. 
Therefore, patients with complete or partial pain relief will be considered responders. Patients 
with complete or partial pain relief at the index site but a progressive response at the secondary 
site(s) will be considered non-responders. 
 
1.7 Quality of Life Measurements ( 09/23/16) 
 It is hypothesized that quality of life (QOL) will improve after radiosurgery due to rapid and 
durable pain control after spi[INVESTIGATOR_158311]. Indeed, in one study, QOL improved secondary to 
pain contr ol (Degen 2005). In the current study, we will measure the QOL after radiosurgery using 
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: (FACT-G), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and the 
EuroQol (EQ-5D).  
1.7.1 Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)  
 The pain originating from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522288]’s QOL because the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424419]-bearing area. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), developed by [CONTACT_522433], et al. (1983) is a 
17-item patient self-rating scale assessing demographic data, use of medications, as well as 
the sensory and reactive components of pain. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_522289], including severity, location, chronicity, and degree of relief due to 
therapy. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_522290], such as depression, 
suffering, and the perceived availability of relief.  The scale is from 0-10, and there are 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677602] item correlation (e.g., for worst 
pain, r = .93).  Issues of the validity and reliability of the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_522291] 
(Jensen 1999; Daut 1983).  The BPI’s ease of translation and brief administration have made it 
a frequently used tool in clinical trials where reduction or prevention of pain are the outcome 
measures. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_522292] 97-[ADDRESS_677603] week on 0-10 scales at its ‘worst’, ‘least’, 
‘average’, and ‘now.’  The scales are presented on a 10 cm line, with each number equidistant 
from the next.  Each scale is bounded by [CONTACT_85900] ‘no pain’ at the 0 end and ‘pain as bad as 
you can imagine’ at the other.  Using the same type of scales, patients also are asked to rate 
how their pain interferes with several quality of life domains including activity, walking, mood, 
sleep, work, and relations with others.  These scales are bounded by ‘does not interfere’ at the 
0 end and ‘interferes completely’ at the other.   Patients also are asked to estimate the pain 
relief they are receiving from their pain treatment (in percent), to locate areas of pain on a 
human figure, and to estimate the cause of their pain (cancer disease, cancer treatment, or 
non-cancer). The patient can complete the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_522293] [ADDRESS_677604] been examined in detail (Daut 1983; 
Cleeland 1989). The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_522294] a pain assessment tool.  The 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_224876] “worst pain” in most cancer populations is 2.4. Therefore, 
the finding of a one-point difference in the “worst pain” item at different times or between two 
comparative groups is considered significant. Translations can be accessed at 
http://www.mdanderson.org/departments/prg/ ; click on “symptom assessment tools” .   
1.7.2 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT- G) 
 Assessment of pain and its relief also are affected by [CONTACT_200801], including the patient’ s 
understanding regarding the nature of pain, and emotional and social background. Therefore, 
as in RTOG 97-14, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT- G), v. 4.0, also will 
be collected. The FACT-G is a commonly used tool measuring the multidimensional 
components of health related quality of life (HRQOL) across 4 scales: physical well-being (7 
items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items) and functional well-
being (7 items) The FACT, developed by [INVESTIGATOR_141264], et al. (1993)., is a five point patient self rating 
scale (from “not at all” to “very much”).  Test-retest reliability is high for the subscales with 
correlation coefficients ranging from a high of .[ADDRESS_677605] has been translated into more than 25 languages, and 
translations are accessible at the FACIT web site, 
http://www.facit.org/FACITOrg/Questionnaires . 
1.7.3 The EuroQol (EQ-5D)   
 The EuroQol ( EQ-5D) instrument is intended to complement other forms of QOL measures, and 
it has been developed to generate a generic cardinal index of health, thus giving it considerable 
potential for future use in economic evaluation.  The EQ-5D is a two-part, patient-completed 
questionnaire that takes approximately 5 minutes to complete(Rabin 2001; Schulz 2002). The 
first part consists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions including: mobility, self care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension can be graded on 3 levels including: 
1=no problems; 2= moderate problems; and 3=extreme problems.  Health states are defined by 
[CONTACT_522434] 5 dimensions, generating 243 health states to 
which unconsciousness and death are added (Badia 1998). The EQ-5D has been translated 
into multiple languages; these translations are available from the EuroQol web site at 
http://www.euroqol.org/ .  The inclusion of the EQ-5D is exploratory, as it allows one to analyze 
important issues related to quality adjusted survival and cost utility analyses and determine if 
the instrument should be included in a future phase III trial.

4.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATIONS/MANAGEMENT 
Note: This section lists baseline evaluations needed before the initiation of protocol treatment that do not 
affect eligibility.   
  
4.1 Required Evaluations/Management (Phase III Component Only)  (8/30/11) 
4.1.1  The patient will complete the baseline Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) on the day of 
treatment identifying how much pain they are having at the index spi[INVESTIGATOR_522308]. 
The patient can be on pain medication. 
 
Note : The Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) used to determine eligibility (a required score 
of ≥ 5; see Section 3.1.8) will not be used to assess treatment response. Documentation of the 
patient’s initial pain score is required. Treatment response will be assessed by [CONTACT_522436]. Patients whose day of treatment NRPS score is < 5 
remain eligible for the study, will receive treatment, and will be followed per protocol 
specifications. 
4.1.2  If the patient consents to participate in the quality of life component of the study, sites are 
required to administer the following baseline quality of life questionnaires prior to the start of 
protocol treatment: The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G); the 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and the EuroQol (EQ-5D). 
 
 
5.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES ( 09/23/16)

5.3 Additional Pre-Registration Requirements for Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) 
(09/23/16) 
5.3.1 IGRT Credentialing Process   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior to entering patients on this study, institutions must perform a verification study. In order 
to complete the verification study, the institution must do the following: 
    Submit a series of planning and localization images along with a spreadsheet of IGRT 
data vi
a TRIAD from an anonymized patient treated similarly to [ADDRESS_677619]-treatment imaging is mandatory for credentialing. 
   The Medical Physics Co-Chair, [CONTACT_522456], will review the images and spreadsheet and 
upon
 his approval of this data, NRG Oncology will notify the institution that this part of 
the credentialing is complete and the institution can continue to enroll patients on 0631. 
See the NRG Oncology/RTOG web site,  
http://www.rtog.org/ClinicalTrials/ProtocolTable/StudyDetails.aspx?study=[ADDRESS_677620] localization images (including setup images of 
simulation position prior to correction , images after reposition prior to treatment, and images of 
post-treatment) are required. Acquisition of additional images acquired during treatment are 
encouraged but not required. Pretreatment, during treatment, and post-treatment images may 
include three-dimensional (3D) volumetric images (either fan- or cone-beam CT with 
Megavoltage [ MV] or kilovoltage [ KV] x-rays). Additionally, orthogonal (MV or KV) 2D electronic 
images can be used . IGRT data and the completed spreadsheet are submitted to TRIAD. 
Sel
ect Benchmark submission. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tolerance Levels for IGRT 
 Three-dimensional views of gross tumor and other adjacent normal tissue structures , 
especially the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], are recommended as reference at the discretion of the treating 
radiation oncologist. Shifts of patient treatment position can be made based on the 
pretreatment im ages . After the position adjustments, the final accuracy of positioning should 
be < [ADDRESS_677621]-shift images, compared with the pre-treatment position.    
 
For those institutions that plan to use orthogonal images for target localization and position 
adjustment, placement of fiducial markers such as seeds (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 3 or more) in or outside 
the gross tumor is recommended. Fiducial markers are often placed under the guidance of 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677622] scan.  An orthogonal view of fiducial markers and/or bony anatomy 
adjacent to the target volume can be used as a standard method. After shifts are made 
based on the pretreatment images and after the position adjustments, the final accuracy of 
positioning should be < [ADDRESS_677623]-shift images, compared with the pre-
treatment position.   
 
5.4 Digital RT Data Submission to NRG Oncology Using TRIAD ( 09/23/16)  
TRIAD is the American College of Radiology’s (ACR) image exchange application. . 
TRIAD provides sites participating in NRG Oncology clinical trials a secure method to 
transmit DICOM RT and other objects. TRIAD anonymizes and validates the images as 
they are transferred.  
 
TRIAD Access Requirements: 
 Site physics staff who will submit images through TRIAD will need to be registered with 
The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and have a valid and active CTEP 
Identity and Access Management (IAM) account. Please refer to Section 5.[ADDRESS_677624] a CTEP-IAM account. 
 To submit images, the site physics user must have been assigned the 'TRIAD site user' 
role on the relevant Group or CTSU roster. NRG Oncology users should contact [CONTACT_522437].  You must have your CTEP IAM username [CONTACT_522454]. Users from other cooperative groups should follow their 
procedures for assignment of roster roles. 
 RAs are able to submit standard of care imaging through the same method. 
 
 
 
TRIAD Installations:  
When a user applies for a CTEP-IAM account with proper user role, he/she will 
need to have the TRIAD application installed on his/her workstation to be able to 
submit images. TRIAD installation documentation can be found on the NRG 
Oncology/RTOG website Core L ab tab.    
 
This process can be done in parallel to obtaining your CTEP-IAM account username [CONTACT_25558].

6.0 RADIATION THERAPY  (8/30/11) 
 The Principal Investigator, Samuel Ryu, MD, and Co-Chairs will perform a rapid review of the treatment 
plan for the first 2 radiosurgery/SBRT cases from each institution prior to the institution delivering any 
protocol treatment on the phase II component or Arm [ADDRESS_677629] be 
resubmitted, it will be given a rapid review (within 3 business days). Treatment plans for subsequent 
patients enrolled at a site will not be reviewed prior to delivery of treatment, but a review will be performed 
at a later date to evaluate protocol compliance.  
 
Questions regarding spi[INVESTIGATOR_158311]/SBRT should be directed to [CONTACT_522457] (preferably by e-mail , 
[EMAIL_9989] , or alternatively by [CONTACT_648], [PHONE_10859]).  
 
Patients may receive external beam irradiation to other sites, brachytherapy (HDR or LDR), or a 
 combination of external beam irradiation and brachytherapy at the discretion of the treating physician.
 Dose/duration also will be at the discretion of the treating physician. However, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522312]/SBRT and other radiotherapy must not occur at the same time or overlap. 
 
Patient registration must be done within 4 weeks after MRI of the involved spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Note: The patient 
will complete the baseline Numerical Rating Pain Scale on the day of treatment. 
 
NOTE: Sections 6.1-6.7 (below) provide information regarding treatment with radiosurgery/SBRT 
for the phase II and phase III (Arm 1) components of this study. See Section 6.6.2 for IGRT 
requirements for Arm 1 patients. If the patient is randomized to Arm 2 of the phase III component, 
see Section 6.8 for details of external beam radiotherapy.  
 
6.1 RADIOSURGERY/SBRT, PHASE II AND PHASE III (ARM 1) COMPONENTS (8/30/11)  
 IMRT OR OTHER DOSE PAINTING TECHNIQUES ARE REQUIRED FOR 
RADIOSURGERY/SBRT. 3D-CRT IS NOT PERMITTED.  
6.1.1 Dose Specifications 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Fractionation   
 Patients treated with radiosurgery/SBRT will receive a prescribed dose of [ADDRESS_677630] 90% of the defined target volume (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . The 
radiation dose will be chosen based on the treating physician’s discretion and achievement 
of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522313]. Coverage of target volume < 90% but > 
80% is a minor violation, and any coverage < 80% is a major deviation (see Section 6.3.2).  
 
See cord dose/volume constraints in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
 
When the patient has multiple spi[INVESTIGATOR_522314], the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522315].  The spi[INVESTIGATOR_522316] T2-weighted and T1-weighted images with 
contrast. In addition to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522317], the treating physician should 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677631] dose that does not meet these criteria is 
a major deviation (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Factors   
 Photon (x-ray) beams produced by [CONTACT_522440] 4-18 MV will be 
allowed, preferably using photon beams with energy of 6 MV or less . IMRT or other dose 
painting techniques are allowed. Proton beams, and other charged particle beams (including 
electrons, heavy ions) are not allowed. Gamma Knife® or Perfexion™ treatment is not 
allowed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedications  
 No premedications are necessary.  
 
 Pain control to help position the patient for the purpose of treatment (not for long-term pain 
control) is permitted to decrease patient movement due to pain. Note: Narcotics can be used 
or increased for the purposes of patient positioning for radiosurgery, as clinically necessary ; 
however, the patient should return to the prior level of pain medication after radiosurgery. 
  
 If it is necessary to minimize patient’s anxiety about the treatment and disease condition or 
for immobilization purposes, medications such as alprazolam or lorazepam are allowed.  
 
 No steroid premedication is indicated, and it is recommended that all patients receiving 
corticosteroids begin tapering them immediately after radiosurgery.   
 
6.2 Immobilization, Simulation, and Localization (11/ 22/13) 
6.2.[ADDRESS_677632] be positioned in a stable supi[INVESTIGATOR_522318], allowing the patient to feel as comfortable as 
possible. Positions uncomfortable for the patient should be avoided to prevent unnecessary 
movement. A prone position is not allowed. A variety of immobilization systems may be utilized 
including vacuum bag, alpha cradle, or stereotactic frames that surround the patient on three 
sides and large rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (conforming to patients external contours) with reference to the 
treatment delivery coordinate system. In addition, for cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_522319], a rigid head and neck immobilization device should be used. Patient immobilization must 
be reliable enough to achieve the accuracy requirement of image-guidance (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repositioning for Treatment 
 It is important to reproduce the treatment position. Pain can cause unintended movement, 
which can prolong treatment time and require repositioning. Therefore, it is important to 
allow the patient to fee l as comfortable as the patient felt during the simulation.  
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_158311]/SBRT is an image-guided procedure. Body frames based only on frame 
fiducials are not be considered adequate image guidance. Recent development of in-room 
(or onboard) imaging technology has improved the stereotactic target localization and 
visualization under image-guidance. These methods can be used where available. 
Coordinate systems between imaging system and delivery system should be aligned for 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_158311]/SBRT. Image data from the repetition of the image-guided maneuver 
near (prior to the last delivered beam) or at the end of the treatment should be sent to the 
ITC (see Section 6.2.3 ). 
 
 The treating physician can decide the day of treatment. Treatment can be given on the same 
day as positioning and simulation when feasible; however, it is not required. It is strongly 
recommended that institutions  treat the patient no later than the day following simulation. 
For the purpose of rapid review of the first case, institutions should allow 3 business days for 
their initial case to be received, processed, and reviewed (as specified in Section 6.0). 
 
 
6.2.2 Simulation 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677633] will help 
visualize the soft tissue and adjacent normal tissues. Axial acquisitions with gantry 0 degrees 
will be required with slice thickness of ≤ 2.5-3 mm, depending on the manufacturer’s selected 
slice thicknesses. Images will be transferred to the treatment planning computers via direct 
lines, disc, or tape. 
6.2.3 Localization 
 Acceptable image-guided techniques include the following. The accuracy of localization should 
be less than 2 mm from simulation/planning to the end of treatment.  
1. Cone-beam CT equipment attached to the linear accelerator,   using either the 
treatment beam or an auxiliary kV x-ray head to obtain multiple projection images for 
volume reconstruction; 
2. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522320]; 
3. Any equipment that can produce stereoscopic planar views of the patient in the 
treatment position, capable of  localizing anatomic points in space or viewing implanted 
fiducial markers. It can use the treatment beam with a standard electronic portal 
imaging device (EPID) or a kV x-ray source with opposed imaging panel.  
4. A standard diagnostic-quality CT scanners positioned in the treatment room and 
geometrically coupled (e.g., on rails) with the treatment equipment. 
 
 Although film procedures could fall under the description given in item [ADDRESS_677634] include both the 
IGRT images and the treatment planning images. 
 
6.3 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  (8/30/11) 
6.3.1 Target Definition 
 Image fusion between MRI (gadolinium contrast T1-weighted and T2-weighted images) and 
simulation CT is required for delineation of both the soft tissue tumor component and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232]. Special attention should be taken with image fusion when simulation CT and MRI images 
are taken in different imaging positions. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522321]. In this situation special attention should be given to fuse the target spi[INVESTIGATOR_522322]. It is recommended but not required that MRIs are obtained with the simulation position. 
MR simulation should be used where available. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiosurgery Target Volume 
 The radiosurgery target volume includes only the involved vertebral body and both left and 
right pedicles as shown in Figure 2 below and the grossly visible tumor, if a paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] o r 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_522323]. An epi[INVESTIGATOR_522324] a ≥ [ADDRESS_677635] and the edge of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_522325]. A paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_445639] ≤ [ADDRESS_677636] dimension contiguous with spi[INVESTIGATOR_522326].  In this study, the terms, GTV or CTV, are not 
used.  
 
The target as defined above will not be enlarged (i.e., no “margin” for presumed 
microscopic extension) . This target volume ultimately becomes the radiosurgery planning 
target volume.  The radiosurgery does not assume set-up errors. However, depending on 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677637] dose constraints. The treatment plan 
is acceptable as long as ≥ 90% of the target volume receives the prescribed radiosurgery 
dose. 
 
 Examples of radiosurgery target volumes are illustrated in Figure [ADDRESS_677638] common type of spi[INVESTIGATOR_424381]. 
The radiosurgery target volume includes the involved vertebral body and both pedicles (solid 
red line).  
 
 Metastatic lesions can be more extensive, involving the pedicles [Figure 2 b]. The target 
volume can be more generous [dotted line of Figure 2b], or the target volume can include 
anterior and posterior elements of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [solid red line of Figure 2 b]. The target volume 
may be chosen at the discretion of the treating Radiation Oncologist based on the extent of 
tumor involvement.  
 
 When the metastasis involves only the posterior element, the target volume includes the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_522327] [solid red line of Figure 2c].  
 
 In any circumstance, when there is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_522328], 
the visible epi[INVESTIGATOR_522329].

spi[INVESTIGATOR_522332]. 
 
 The conventional spi[INVESTIGATOR_522333] e 
fusion with T2-weighted and T1-weighted MRI with contrast. It is recommended that a 
simulation CT be done with contrast, but this is not required. The conventional spi[INVESTIGATOR_522334] [ADDRESS_677639] is contoured based on the image fusion 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677640] dose constraints are used in this study: 1) the dose constraints for the 
partial spi[INVESTIGATOR_321714] 10 Gy to no more than 10% of the partial spi[INVESTIGATOR_522269];  or 
2) the dose constraint for the conventional spi[INVESTIGATOR_321714] [ADDRESS_677641] 
volume less than 0.35cc; or 3) the maximum cord dose is [ADDRESS_677642] dose exceeding 
these constraints is not acceptable and is a major deviation. 
 
Figure 3: Diagram of Defining Partial Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522335] . Each CT slice within the radiosurgery plan should be checked to screen any 
unacceptably high radiation dose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522336]. In this situation, 
the treating physician can make the decision of proceeding or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_522337]-planning. Critical organs including spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], liver, kidneys, and lung should 
be analyzed for radiation dose distribution if any of them are transected by [CONTACT_522441] n 
field. The dose-volume guidelines are described in Sections 6.3.2 and 6.4. 
6.3.2 Dosimetry   
 Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or other dose painting techniques will be used to 
deliver highly conformal dose distributions. Non-coplanar beams can be employed. Non-
opposing beams are preferable. Multiple beam directions or arcs of radiation will be used for 
geometrically complicated lesions. The beam arrangement should be placed mostly from the 
posterior direction to avoid the radiation beam enter ing through the lungs. Intensity-modulated 
arc therapy with either multiple static cones or dynamic conformal multileaf collimators (MLC) 
can be used. For arc rotation al techniques, every effort should be used to limit the radiation 
through the lung.   
 
 A common point should be defined, which is close to the center of the target volume for dose 
normalization. Preferably, this point is placed at the treatment isocenter if a linac based delivery 
system is used. The plan should be normalized to the common point or isocenter or its vicinity 
suitable for dose normalization. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this point will be the isocenter of the beam rotation; 
however, it is not a protocol requirement for this point to be the isocenter. Inhomogeneity 
correction must be included for dose calculation. The prescription dose of 16 or 18 Gy will be 
delivered to the margin of the target volume and fulfill the requirements below. The treatment 
plan is acceptable as long as > 90% of the target volume receives the prescribed radiosurgery 
dose.

RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 17  Successful treatment planning will require accomplishment of all of the following criteria:  
  1 )   Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage  
 Patients will receive 16 or 18 Gy in 1 fraction of radiosurgery. This study requires 90% 
coverage of the target volume by [CONTACT_342581].   Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the 80-90% isodose line 
is used as prescription line. Depending on the delivery system, this prescription isodose 
line may be different. Coverage of < 90% of the target volume is a Variation Acceptable , 
and any coverage of < 80% of the target volume is a Deviation Unacceptable. 
 2 )   Target Dose Heterogeneity  
 The treatment plan is per protocol  as long as ≥ 90% of the target volume receives the 
prescribed radiosurgery dose. Dose inhomogeneity can exist within the target volume.  
  3 )   High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522339], there 
can be hot spots in the immediate vicinity outside of the target volume. The area of hot spot 
often can be seen in the immediate paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_522340] (e.g., 
psoas) or rib cage including intercostals muscle. Dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_522341].  Plans that do not meet these limits are scored 
as either Variation Acceptable or Deviation Unacceptable (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
The Per Protocol plan:  
 limits dose outside of the target volume to greater than or equal to 105% of the 
prescription dose to a volume of less than or equal to 3 .0 cc ; 
 limits dose of greater than or equal to 105% of the prescription dose to a region 
within 1.0 cm from the edge of the target volume ; 
 excludes all doses of greater than or equal to 110% of the prescription dose outside 
of the target volume .  
It i
s important to point out that these dose limits do not override the dose restrictions for the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_522342] 4 (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_8184]) and in Section 6.4.1 .1.  The high 
dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_522343] 
[IP_ADDRESS] by 1 cm.  Examination of the DVH for this rind around the target will determine the 
size of any high dose regions outside the target.  If the region of dose higher than 105% of 
the prescribed dose is seen to go outside of this margin region, the case will be scored 
according to the rules in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
4) Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522344] 10 Gy to the 10% of the 
partial spi[INVESTIGATOR_522345] 5-[ADDRESS_677643] volume and the 10% volume will increase.  In no case should the 
dose of [ADDRESS_677644] dose that does not meet these criteria is a major 
deviation. 
 5)   Low Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522346]: Using radiation beams 
directed from posterior to minimize passage of radiation through the lungs is strongly 
recommended .

 These limits were formulated based on the widely accepted norms with radiosurgery in current 
practice. Participating centers are encouraged to observe prudent treatment planning principles 
in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to critical normal structures irrespective of these 
limits. 
 
 In order to verify each of these limits, the organs must be contoured such that appropriate dose 
volume histograms can be generated. See Section 6.4.2 for instructions for the contouring of 
these organs.

dose. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The lung dose constraint is based on a critical volume model and requires no more than 
1,000 cc of lung tissue to be treated to a dose ≥ 7.[ADDRESS_677648] in this trial.   
6.4.2 Contouring of Normal Tissue Structures 
Normal tissue contouring is required starting at 10 cm above the target volume to 10 cm 
below the target.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522352]: the conventional and 
partial spi[INVESTIGATOR_522332]. See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Esophagus 
 The esophagus will be contoured using mediastinal windowing on CT to correspond to the 
mucosal, submucosa, and muscular layers. The esophagus should be defined starting at 
least [ADDRESS_677649] 10 cm below the inferior extent of the target volume. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Larynx and Pharynx 
 The larynx and pharynx will be contoured to the mucosal, submucosa, and cartilages and 
airway channels associated with these structures. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Trachea and Airway 
 The trachea and airway adjacent to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522353], 
submucosa and cartilage rings and airway channels. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lung  
 Both the right and left lungs should be contoured using pulmonary windows. All inflated and 
collapsed lung should be contoured; however, paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_522354], if any, should not be 
included in this structure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Kidney 
 Both the right and left kidneys should be contoured. Paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_522355]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin 
 The skin will be defined as the outer 0.5 cm of the body surface.  As such, it is a rind of 
uniform thickness (0.5 cm) which envelopes the entire body in the axial planes.  The cranial 
and caudal surface of the superior and inferior limits of the planning CT should not be 
contoured as skin unless skin is actually present in these locations (e.g., the scalp on the top 
of the head). 
 
6.5 Documentation Requirements  (8/30/11) 
6.5.1 In general, treatment interruptions (e.g. due to intractable pain during the treatment) should be 
avoided by [CONTACT_522442], psychological, and emotional 
counseling. Treatment breaks, including indications, must be clearly documented on the 
treatment record.  For Arm [ADDRESS_677650] be submitted; see Section 6.6.2 for 
details. 
 
6.6 Compliance Criteria for Arm 1 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522309] ( 8/30/11) 
6.6.[ADDRESS_677651] for treatment planning dosimetry. The optimal target 
coverage level is ≥ 90% volume to be covered by [CONTACT_247374]. Coverage of < 90% is a 
Variation Acceptable, and coverage of < 80% is a Deviation Unacceptable. Any spi[INVESTIGATOR_522356] [IP_ADDRESS] is not acceptable and is a major 
deviation. The table in Section 6.4 lists dose volume limits for specific organs and structures. 
Exceeding these limits by [CONTACT_726] 2.5% constitutes a minor violation. Exceeding these limits 
by [CONTACT_726] 5% constitutes a major deviation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522357]  
 limits dose outside of the  target volume to greater than or equal to 105% of the 
prescription dose to a volume of less than or equal to 2.0 cc;

the target volume;  
 allows doses outside of the target volume to go above 110% but not above 115% of 
the prescription dose.  
 
Deviation Unacceptable  is defined as any dose distribution where the limits stated for 
Variation Acceptable are not met.    
6.6.2 IGRT:  Treatment Delivery Compliance  
Pre-treatment imaging, pre-treatment/post-shift imaging (if applicable), and Post-
treatment imaging, including a completed IGRT spreadsheet of the shifts, are REQUIRED 
to be obtained and submitted.  
  
Setup images (obtained from the IGRT system) will be compared to corresponding reference 
images to identify any potential deviation. The institution’s IGRT systems must demonstrate < 2 
mm agreement between simulation/planning and treatment, as well as at the end of treatment.  
 
6.7 R.T. Quality Assurance Reviews ( 11/22/ 13) 
 The Principal Investigator, Samuel Ryu, MD, and his Co-Chairs will perform a rapid review of the 
treatment plan for the first 2 cases from each institution prior to the institution delivering any 
protocol treatment using radiosurgery/SBRT. Institutions should allow [ADDRESS_677652] be resubmitted, it will be 
given a rapid review as described in Section 6.0. Treatment plans for subsequent patients 
enrolled at a site will not be reviewed prior to delivery of treatment, but a review will be performed 
at a later date to evaluate protocol compliance.  
 
 Treatment planning images and dosimetry planning information in accepted format will be 
submitted to TRIAD for quality assurance ( QA) purposes in all cases. See Section 12.[ADDRESS_677653] a policy of quality assurance according to the 
guideline of SBRT by [CONTACT_522443] (Potters 2004; Bissonnette 2007; Yoo 2006). The 
standard practice of checking radiation output should be carried out each day of treatment. Tests 
aimed at guaranteeing agreement of the image guidance system and the treatment system, 
including repositioning accuracy, must be carried out each day an SBRT treatment is scheduled. 
Dose delivery must be carried out for these treatments.  
  
The Study Chair, Samuel Ryu, MD, and the Medical Physics Co-Chair, [CONTACT_522456], will perform an 
RT Quality Assurance Review on an ongoing basis. The final cases will be reviewed within [ADDRESS_677654] a QA for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522358]’s radiosurgery 
method and equipment. The following can be used as a guideline. Detailed QA information can 
be found in the AAPM TG 142 report. 
 
 Daily Stereotactic System QA 
1. Linac morning warm up and radiation output check; 
2. Localization system (mainly immobilization and imaging systems) QA, including the 
geometric alignment of the imaging system and delivery system;  
3. Linac isocenter accuracy QA, mainly checking the stability during gantry rotation and table 
rotation and the consistency of the room laser system with the Linac isocenter. 
 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 22 Individual Patient QA  
1. Dose calculation check;  
2. Fluence/map field check for IMRT; 
3. Collision check for each treatment field; 
4. Patient position setup and check. 
 
6.8 EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY, PHASE III COMPONENT, ARM 2 (8/30/11) 
 INTENSITY MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY (IMRT) IS NOT ALLOWED FOR ARM 2 IN THE 
PHASE III COMPONENT OF THE STUDY. 
6.8.1  Dose Specifications  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Fractionation and Treatment Volume for 2D or 3D Treatment  
 For Arm 2, external beam radiotherapy, the prescribed dose is 8 Gy in 1 fraction. Treatment 
volume will include the entire vertebral body(s) of the involved index spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], plus one 
vertebral body superior and one vertebral body inferior to the index spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. A treatment field 
margin of 1-2 cm laterally beyond the vertebral body(s) can be used, based on the treating 
physician’s discretion, and either 2D or 3D conformal therapy is allowed at the treating 
physician’s discretion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Factors 
 External beam radiotherapy must be given using megavoltage equipment with 4- 18 MV 
photons. Electrons, protons, Gamma Knife® or Perfexion™ treatment are not permitted. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedications 
 No premedications are necessary. 
 
Pain control to help position the patient for the purpose of treatment (not for long-term pain 
control) is permitted to decrease patient movement due to pain. Note: Narcotics can be used 
or increased for the purposes of patient positioning for radiosurgery, as clinically necessary; 
however, the patient should return to the prior level of pain medication after radiosurgery. 
  
 If it is necessary to minimize patient’s anxiety about the treatment and disease condition or 
for immobilization purposes, medications such as alprazolam or lorazepam are allowed. 
 
No steroid premedication is indicated, and it is recommended that all patients receiving 
corticosteroids begin tapering them immediately after external beam treatment .  
6.8.2  Patient Positioning and Simulation  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Positioning   
Patients must be positioned in a stable supi[INVESTIGATOR_522359]’s discretion. 
Any immobilization techniques can be used for conventional radiotherapy or 3D conformal 
therapy at the treating physician’s discretion. For cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_522319], a head and neck immobilization device can be used. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Simulation 
Simulation of treatment fields is required prior to the treatment. There must be an acceptable 
DRR or simulation image and portal image documenting that the treatment site is adequately 
covered and verified by [CONTACT_522444]. Both digital and analog format 
images are acceptable, preferably digital images. 
6.8.3 Treatment Planning  
[IP_ADDRESS]  2D Treatment  
Treatment target volume will include the involved index spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], plus one spi[INVESTIGATOR_522360]. A treatment field margin of 1-2 cm laterally 
beyond the vertebral body(s) can be used, based on the treating physician’s discretion. 
 
Field arrangements to treat the target lesion may be chosen at the discretion of the treating 
Radiation Oncologist. In general, posterior only, anterior-posterior, opposed lateral (for c-
spi[INVESTIGATOR_19235]), or posterior oblique field arrangements will be used. Either a SAD or SSD 
technique is acceptable. The treatment depth is set at the center of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158470], as 
determined on the simulation CT or MRI or lateral film of conventional simulation.  
 
 Anterior and posterior parallel opposed fields can be used for thoracic or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
Equal or unequal weighting may be used (e.g., a ratio of doses of 1:2 AP:PA). The dose is 
prescribed to the center of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522361]. 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677655] or MRI or anterior/lateral films of conventional simulation. 
Dose is prescribed to a point, not the treatment volume. While dose is prescribed to a point, 
it is recommended (but not required) that the goal of appropriate treatment planning aim to 
achieve coverage of the target lesion volume by [CONTACT_2669] 90% of the prescribed dose. Three-
dimensional conformal therapy is allowed, but IMRT is not allowed for Arm 2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] 3D Treatment  
CT simulation is required. Treatment volume will include the entire vertebral body(s) of the 
involved index spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], plus one vertebral body superior and one vertebral body inferior to the 
index spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. N on-coplanar beams can be employed. Multiple beam directions can be used.  
 
 Target volume should be delineated. A treatment field margin of 1-2 cm beyond the vertebral 
body(s) can be used in any direction, based on the treating physician’s discretion, as long as 
more than or equal to 90% of the target spi[INVESTIGATOR_522362]. 
 
A common point should be defined, which is close to the center of the target volume for dose 
normalization. Preferably, this point is placed at the treatment isocenter if a linac-based 
delivery system is used. The plan should be normalized to the common point or isocenter or 
its vicinity suitable for dose normalization. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this point will be the isocenter of the 
beam rotation; however, it is not a protocol requirement for this point to be the isocenter. 
Inhomogeneity correction must be included for dose calculation. The prescription dose will 
be delivered to the margin of the target volume. The treatment plan is acceptable as long as 
more than or equal to 90% of the target volume receives the prescribed dose, with the same 
normal tissue constraints described in Table 1. Dose inhomogeneity can exist within the 
target volume. 
6.8.4 Critical Structures 
See Section 6.4.1, Table 1, “One Fraction Dose Constraints for Arms 1 and 2 ”. 
 
For 2D treatment , contouring of normal tissue structure is not required. However, spi[INVESTIGATOR_522363], i.e., at the center of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158470]. 
Normal tissue structures can be delineated and the dose can be recorded at the treating 
physician’s discretion. Any adverse events should be reported as described in Section 6.10. 
 
For 3D treatment, the same normal tissue constraints described in Table 1 apply. The normal 
tissues as well as the target volume should be delineated as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. If the 
normal tissue constraints are not met at the 10 Gy level, the total dose can be lowered to 8 Gy 
at the treating physician’s discretion. Any adverse events should be reported as described in 
Section 6.10. 
6.8.5  Documentation Requirements  
[IP_ADDRESS]  For 2D treatment, portal images of each field must be obtained on or before the day of 
therapy but sites are not required to submit these. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planning images and dosimetry information for 2D treatment are not required to be 
submitted. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Isodose plans and documentation of isocenter positions for 3D radiotherapy are required to 
be submitted per Section 12.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  In general, treatment interruptions (e.g., due to intractable pain during the treatment) should 
be avoided by [CONTACT_522445]. Treatment breaks, including indications, must 
be clearly documented on the treatment record.   
6.8.6  Compliance Criteria for 3D Treatment  
Dosimetric compliance for the protocol is that coverage of < 90% but ≥ 80% of the target 
volume is a Variation Acceptable, and any coverage of < 80% of the target volume is a 
Deviation Unacceptable.  
 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 24 EBRT will follow the normal tissue dose constraints as shown in Section 6.4 , Table 1. 
Exceeding these limits by [CONTACT_726] 2.5% constitutes a minor violation. Exceeding these limits 
by [CONTACT_726] 5% constitutes a major deviation. 
6.8.[ADDRESS_677656]. Radiation myelitis is a 
subacute or chronic clinical syndrome after radiation. The symptoms may include paresthesia, 
sensory changes, and motor weakness including paralysis. There is no active treatment for 
radiation myelitis; therefore, it is important to prevent any injury to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. 
Corticosteroids are used when clinical symptoms develop.  
 
 In the Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59361], one case of radiation myelitis was reported.(Ryu 2007).  
The patient had a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. The initial treatment was mastectomy 
followed by [CONTACT_11553] (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). After [ADDRESS_677657] enhancing 
mass involving the clivus, occipi[INVESTIGATOR_522364], and C1 vertebra with epi[INVESTIGATOR_522365]. This 
was consistent with metastatic involvement. She was treated with single dose radiosurgery 16 
Gy, prescribed to the 90% isodose line encompassing the gross tumor volume.  The same 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_522366]. The doses to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522367] 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, and 1% were 6.[ADDRESS_677658] volume within the 
80% isodose line was 0.06 cc, and 0.32 % cord volume. The patient had a complete neurologic 
recovery and pain relief, and a complete tumor response radiographically. She then received 
chemotherapy with carboplatin and docetaxel for 6 months and continued trastuzumab as well 
as zoledronic acid and fulvestrant (at another institution). However, 13 months after 
radiosurgery, she developed right lower extremity weakness with 4/[ADDRESS_677659] 2 
weeks. These symptoms subside with time; however, adequate symptomatic treatment 
including hydration is advised. There are no long-term adverse events reported with spi[INVESTIGATOR_522368]. However, it is prudent to minimize the radiation spi[INVESTIGATOR_522369]. 
The consequences of esophageal toxicity, e.g., swallowing difficulty, dysphagia, cough, 
dehydration, and fistula, should be documented. 
 
 In the Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59361], one case of tracheoesophageal fistula was reported in 
patient with multiple myeloma (Ryu 2008b). This patient was severely immunocompromised 
from previous bone marrow transplantation and systemic chemotherapy with multiple medical 
comorbidities including a mycobacterial granulomatous infection involving the esophagus. The 
patient was treated for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522370] T4 and paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_522371] a dose of [ADDRESS_677660] 2 weeks. These symptoms subside with time; however, adequate symptomatic treatment 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677661] parameters, 
pleural effusion or pleuritic pain (associated with collapse), should be documented. 
6.9.[ADDRESS_677662] been no reported cases of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis with spi[INVESTIGATOR_522368]. However, it is prudent to minimize the radiation spi[INVESTIGATOR_522372]. It is 
strongly recommended to use radiation beams directed from posterior to avoid passage of 
radiation through the lungs.  
  
 Patients with symptoms of pneumonitis will be promptly evaluated and treated. Mild radiation 
pneumonitis may be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or steroid inhalers. 
More significant pneumonitis will be treated with systemic steroids, bronchodilators, and 
pulmonary toilet. Supra- and concurrent infections should be treated with antibiotics. 
Consideration of prophylaxis of opportunistic infections should be considered in immuno-
compromised patients. 
6.9.6 Compression Fracture of Treated Vertebra 
 There has been no formally reported incidence of vertebral compression fracture as the result 
of spi[INVESTIGATOR_158311]; the incidence is estimated to be 5-30% (Jin 2006; Yamada 2008). 
Patients with multiple myeloma appear to be more prone to develop compression fracture than 
patients with other histology. There is no known radiation dose relationship. This study is 
designed to follow up the potential bony change of the treated spi[INVESTIGATOR_522373]. The 
most common symptom from compression fracture is pain. Kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty can 
be used to address the compression fracture; however, retropulsed compression causing 
neurological signs may need surgery.  
6.9.[ADDRESS_677663] has not been reported. If other 
severe adverse events occur, details should be documented.  
 
6.10 Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Reporting Requirements 
(09/23/16) 
 Adverse events (AEs) as defined in the tables below and all serious adverse events (SAEs) 
will be reported to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) via the CTEP Adverse 
Event  Reporting System (CTEP-AERS) application as directed in this section. 
 
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
3.0 for routine adverse event (AE) reporting on the case report form .  
 
Adverse events (AEs) that meet expedited reporting criteria defined in the table(s) below will be 
reported via the CTEP-AERS. CTEP-AERS utilizes the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 and the 
application can be accessed via the CTEP web site  
https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task?rand=[ADDRESS_677664] access to both the CTCAE versions 3.0 and 4.0. . 
The CTCAE versions 3.0 and 4.0 are located on the CTEP website at                                                                                          
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm   
 
 
Definition of an AE : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
hum
ans, whether or not considered drug related.  Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or 
definite). (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH], E2A, E6).  
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 26  
Routine adverse event reporting guidelines are available at 
(http://www.rtog.org/ResearchAssociates/AdverseEventReporting.aspx ).  
  
 Definition of an SAE: Any adverse experience occurring during any part of protocol treatment 
and 30 days after that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening adverse experience; 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
 Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64961], when, based upon medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition. Due to the risk of intrauterine exposure of a fetus to potentially 
teratogenic agents, the pregnancy of a study participant must be reported via CTEP-AERS in an 
expedited manner.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) that meet expedited reporting criteria defined in the table below 
will be reported via CTEP-AERS.  SAEs that require [ADDRESS_677665] the CTEP-AERS Help Desk if assistance is 
required.

RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 28 Additional Instructions or Exceptions to CTEP-AERS  Expedited Reporting Requirements for 
Phase 2 and 3 Trials: 
The following are protocol-specific exceptions to expedited reporting via CTEP-AERS:  grade 1 and grade 
2 adverse events.  Routine adverse event reporting on the case report form fulfills safety reporting 
requirements for these events during protocol treatment. 
 
6.10.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) 
AML or MDS that is diagnosed as a secondary malignancy during or subsequent to treatment in 
patients on NCI/CTEP-sponsored clinical trials must be reported via  CTEP-AERS   within 30 days 
of AML/MDS diagnosis.  
 
Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the event: 
 
 Le ukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  
 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
 Treatment-related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via 
CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
 
7.0 DRUG THERAPY 
 Not applicable to this study. 
 
8.0 SURGERY 
8.1 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522375]/or Compression Fractures 
 Patients with overt spi[INVESTIGATOR_522376], 
particularly with bony retropulsion, should be evaluated by a qualified spi[INVESTIGATOR_522377]. These patients are not eligible for this study. The decision for open 
surgical intervention will be determined by [CONTACT_8236]’s treating neurosurgeon and radiation 
oncologist. 
 
9.0 OTHER THERAPY 
9.1 Permitted Supportive Therapy 
 All supportive therapy for optimal medical care will be given during the study period at the 
discretion of the attending physician(s) within the parameters of the protocol and documented on 
each site’s source documents as concomitant medication.  
9.1.1  Steroids 
 Prophylactic use of steroids is not necessary. No steroid premedication is indicated for 
radiosurgery treatment. If the patient has already started steroid medication, it  can be tapered 
immediately after radiosurgery is completed (see Section 6.1.3).  
9.1.2  Analgesics 
 Pain control to help position the patient for the purpose of treatment (not for long-term pain 
control) is permitted to decrease voluntary patient movement. Note: Narcotics can be 
increased for the purposes of patient positioning for treatment, as clinically necessary 
for pain control (see Section 6.1.3 ). 
 
 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 29  
9.1.3 Anti-Anxiety Medications 
 If it is necessary to minimize patient’s anxiety about the treatment and disease condition or for 
immobilization purposes, medications such as alprazolam or lorazepam are allowed for the 
radiosurgery procedure. 
9.1.4 Supportive Therapy for Acute Radiation Reactions 
 Supportive therapy is allowed for medical care of acute radiation symptoms, such as treatment 
of mucositis. 
9.2 Non-permitted Therapy 
 Chemotherapy is not permitted within 24 hours prior to or concurrently with radiosurgery. In 
addition, the patient can receive chemotherapy no earlier than 24 hours after radiosurgery.  
 
10.0 SPECIMEN SUBMISSION — Phase III Component Of The Study ( 09/23/16) 
For patients who have consented to participate in the specimen submission component of the study (See 
the Sample Informed Consent).  
 
NOTE: Patients must be offered the opportunity to participate in the correlative components of the 
study, such as specimen submission.  If the patient consents to participate in the specimen component 
of the study, the site is required to submit the patient’s specimens as specified below. Sites are not 
permitted to delete the specimen component from the protocol or from the sample consent. 
 
10.1 Specimen Submission (09/23/16)  
 The NRG Oncology Biopspecimen Bank-San Francisco at the University of [LOCATION_004] San 
Francisco acquires and maintains high quality specimens from NRG Oncology trials. NRG 
Oncology encourages participants in protocol studies to consent to the banking of their 
specimens. The NRG Oncology Biopspecimen Bank provides specimens to investigators for 
translational research studies. Translational research studies integrate the newest research 
findings into current protocols to investigate important biologic questions. Note : The NRG 
Oncology Biopspecimen Bank will provide collection kits and instructions at no charge for the 
submission of specimens in this protocol; see Appendices IV and V. 
 
In this study, it is strongly encouraged that blood (serum/plasma/whole blood) and urine be 
submitted to the NRG Oncology Biopspecimen Bank for the purpose of banking and for 
translational research. If the patient consents, serum, plasma, whole blood, and urine will be 
collected at baseline and serum, plasma, and urine at [ADDRESS_677670] to side effects from treatment. Although 
substantial evidence has been obtained from a series of studies suggestive of a genetic basis for 
clinical radiosensitivity of normal tissue, much work still remains to be accomplished in this area.   
 
The whole blood collected will be utilized for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  Single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common variation responsible for genetic 
diversity between individuals, accounting for more than 85% of the variability.  Recent advances 
in SNP identification and analysis have made SNP genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_522378]. SNP genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_522379].  
 
The pretreatment plasma, serum and urine and [ADDRESS_677671]-treatment collection of these fluids 
will be tested for a number of cytokines and proteins that are thought to be predictive of long-term 
radiation toxicity.  This may lead to identification of promising similar or new biomarkers with the 
goals of 
1. Identifying factors predictive of outcome such that patients may be better stratified in 
future trials;

11.0 PATIENT ASSESSMENTS ( 09/23 /16) 
 11.1 Study Parameters : See Appendix I for a summary of patient assessments and timeframes.  
  
11.2 Evaluations: Phase III Component ( 09/23/16) 
11.2.1 The patient will complete the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) documenting the worst pain 
of treated spi[INVESTIGATOR_321722](s) at the baseline clinic visit (on the day of treatment) and at home at [ADDRESS_677676] their pain medications and any side effects 
they are experiencing. Documentation of the patient’s initial pain score is required. 
 
Sites will make 3 copi[INVESTIGATOR_522381] (available on either the I1 or F1 forms) for the patient to 
complete at home at these time points, and patient will bring in the NRPS and record of pain 
medications and side effects at the clinic visit 1 month after randomization. At this clinic visit, 
patients will complete the 1 month NRPS on the same day of the week as the patient’s 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 32 treatment occurred, and sites will summarize the patient’s pain level, pain medications, and 
document any adverse events o n the F1 form (see Section 12.1). Patients also will complete 
the NRPS at the 3 (required) , 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_677677] the pain score in the patient’s chart rather 
than having the patient complete the NRPS on paper. 
 
The NRPS score should be collected for each spi[INVESTIGATOR_522382]. The highest 
numerical pain score of the index lesion will be followed for the primary endpoint of pain 
response (i.e., improvement at this treated site of ≥ 3 points on the NRPS, as long as other 
sites remain stable or decrease). If there is more than one site with identical highest pain score, 
then the most cephalad lesion will be defined as the index lesion. 
 
The NRPS is an 11-point scale (0-10). Patients are instructed that [ADDRESS_677678] pain imaginable. In general, scores of 1-4 indicate mild pain, scores of 5-
6 indicate moderate pain, and scores of 7-10 indicate severe pain. Patients will be instructed to 
report the pain score of each treated site. Patients can complete the NRPS in approximately 1 
minute. 
11.2.2 An MRI of the treated spi[INVESTIGATOR_522383] 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after 
randomization to assess the paravertebral or epi[INVESTIGATOR_522384]-term change of vertebral bone after radiosurgery. 
11.2.3 Quality of Life Assessments  
 Patients participating in the phase III component and who agree to participate in the quality of 
life component of the study will complete the quality of life assessments at baseline and at 3, 6, 
12, and 24 months after randomization.  
  
 NOTE : Patients must be offered the opportunity to participate in the quality of life component of 
the study.  Sites are not permitted to delete the quality of life component from the protocol or 
from the sample consent.

transcribe the data to the appropriate NRG Oncology data form and attach the patient’s 
original. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The EuroQol (EQ-5D) 
 The EuroQol (EQ-5D) is a two-part questionnaire that the patient can complete in 
approximately 5 minutes. Note: The EQ-5D has been translated into multiple languages; 
these translations are available from the EuroQol web site at http://www.euroqol.org/ . The 
site research nurse or CRA should encourage the patient not to skip questions on the EQ-
5D or take breaks during the completion of this questionnaire, as this will invalidate the 
assessment. If this occurs, sites will document it on the Health Utility Measurement (HP) 
form. 
 
11.3 Pain Response Definitions  (also see Section 13.4.1) 
 Pain response will be defined as follows :  
11.3.1 Complete response: Post-treatment pain score of 0 at the index site;  
11.3.2 Partial response: Post-treatment improvement of at least 3 points at the index site;  
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 33 11.3.3 Stable response: Post-treatment pain score within 2 points of the initial pain score at the index 
site; 
11.3.4 Progressive response: A post-treatment increase of at least 3 points at the index site.  
11.3.5 A complete, partial, or stable response at the index site requires no increase in narcotic pain 
medication and no increase in pain score at the secondary treated site(s). Although complete 
response is the best possible outcome, partial response is also a satisfactory outcome. 
Therefore, patients with complete or partial response will be considered responders. Any 
patient with a complete or partial response at the index site but a progressive response at the 
secondary sites will be considered a non-responder.

13.2 Sample Size (6/27/14)  
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 35 13.2.1 Phase II Component Sample Size Derivation 
 The sample size calculations for the phase II component will address the specific primary 
hypothesis that multiple NRG/RTOG institutions can successfully treat spi[INVESTIGATOR_522388]-guided radiosurgery/SBRT. Thus, accrual from the Principal Investigator’s institution, 
Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], will be limited to 5 patients. Treatment compliance will be deemed as 
acceptable, marginally acceptable with minor deviation, or unacceptable with major deviation 
as detailed in Section 6. 0. Successful treatment will include acceptable or marginally 
acceptable treatment reviews. Based on the results of NRG Oncology RTOG 0236, in which 
85% of patients were successfully treated with SBRT for lung cancer, we expect a similar 
success rate for SBRT in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522389]. A success rate below 70% is 
unacceptable for continuation to the phase III component. Based on the one-sided exact 
binomial test with alpha 0.10, [ADDRESS_677688] an 18 % relative reduction 
in the success rate (from 85% to 70%) with a statistical power of 0.85. Adjusting by 
[CONTACT_3450] 5% to allow for patients that are found retrospectively ineligible, the total 
sample size required for the phase II component is 43 patients .  
13.2.2 Phase III Component Sample Size Derivation 
 The phase III component will be pursued after establishing treatment feasibility in the phase II 
component. The sample size calculations for the phase III component will address the specific 
primary hypothesis that the use of image guided radiosurgery/SBRT (Arm 1) will result in a 
statistically significant improvement in pain relief at 3 months as compared to the use of 
external beam radiation (Arm 2), based on the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS). 
 
 The proportion of patients experiencing pain relief at [ADDRESS_677689] that patients treated with external beam radiation (Arm 2) will have 
response rates similar to those evidenced in NRG Oncology RTOG 97-14 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). In 
the subgroup of patients treated for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522390] 97-14, 51% of 
patients experienced partial or complete pain relief at [ADDRESS_677690]-treatment. We hypothesize 
that image-guided radiosurgery/SBRT (Arm 1) will result in a statistically significant 
improvement in the proportion of patients experiencing pain relief 3 months after randomization: 
 
 H 0:  p 1 = p 2 vs.   H A:  p 1 > p [ADDRESS_677691] with alpha 0.025 and a 2:[ADDRESS_677692] a 40% improvement in the response rate (from 51% to 
70%) due to image-guided radiosurgery/SBRT (Arm 1) with a statistical power of 0.80 . 
Assuming a 5% ineligibility rate, a death rate of 15%, and a patient non-compliance rate of 
15%, the total sample size required for the phase III component would be 352 patients. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stratification and Randomization  
 Patients will be stratified in the phase III component according to the number of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522391] (1 vs. 2) and the tumor type (radioresistant [soft tissue sarcoma, 
melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma] versus other type s). The treatment allocation scheme 
described by [CONTACT_453801] (1974) will be used because it balances patient factors other than 
institution. Within each stratum, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either image-
guided radiosurgery/SBRT or external beam radiation. The 2:1 randomization allocation will 
be used to accommodate increased demand for image-guided radiosurgery/SBRT.        
 
13.[ADDRESS_677693] tumor 
metastases (Jemal 1979). Bone is the third most common site of metastasis. The spi[INVESTIGATOR_522392] a common site. (Black 1979) There is an increasing trend of more frequently diagnosing 
patients with localized spi[INVESTIGATOR_522393], although the incidence of solitary spi[INVESTIGATOR_522249]. There is an 
emerging role for image-guided radiosurgery in the treatment of localized spi[INVESTIGATOR_158444]. 
There are no competing cooperative trials at this time. 
 
 RTOG 97-14 accrued an average of 17.1 bone metastases patients per month . Limited to 
patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278], average accrual was 5.6 patients per month. Accrual to RTOG 
0631 is expected to be comparable to accrual for RTOG 9714 spi[INVESTIGATOR_522394]. We 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/[ADDRESS_677694] 6 
patients per month. It will take approximately 5 .5 years ( 65 months) to accrue the projected 
sample size of 352 patients. The NRG Oncology Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will begin 
evaluating patient accrual semi-annually during the phase III component. If the average monthly 
accrual rate for the trial in the fifth and sixth quarters after study activation (i.e., in months 13-18) 
is less than 20% of the rate projected in the paragraph above (i.e., less than 1 patient per month), 
the study will close to further accrual. If the average monthly accrual rate is greater than 20% but 
less than 50% of projected (i.e., between 1-3 patients per month), the trial will be placed on 
probation for 6 months. If the average monthly accrual rate at the end of the probationary period 
is less than 50% of projected (3 patients per month), the study will close to future accrual.   
 
13.4 Analysis Plan (09/ 23/16) 
13.4.1  Phase II Analysis of Treatment Delivery 
Ineligible patients and patients without treatment data will not be evaluated. Successful 
treatment delivery is defined as acceptable or minor variation as detailed in section 6. 0. Toxicity 
burden will be evaluated to identify patients not completing treatment due to excessive toxicity .  
 
Image-guided radiosurgery/SBRT will be deemed feasible in a cooperative group setting if 32 
out of the 41 evaluable patients successfully complete treatment (Section 13.2.2). Given that 
feasibility has been established, the results will be provided to NCI for approval to proceed with 
the phase III component. 
13.4.[ADDRESS_677695] baseline (day of radiosurgery) pain score. If multiple sites 
have the same baseline pain score, the index site is the most cephalad lesion. 
 
 Scoring system for pain is a numerical 11-point scale (0-10). Patients are instructed that [ADDRESS_677696].  
 
 Pain response will be categorized as following: 1) complete response, post-treatment pain 
score of 0 at the index site; 2) partial response, post-treatment improvement of at least 3 points 
at the index site; 3) stable response, post-treatment pain score within 3 points of the initial pain 
score at the index site, or 4) progressive response, a post-treatment increase of at least 3 
points at the index site. A complete, partial, or stable response at the index site requires no 
increase in narcotic pain medication and no increase in pain score at the secondary treated 
site(s). Although complete response is the best possible outcome, partial response is also a 
satisfactory outcome. Therefore, patients with complete or partial response will be considered 
responders. Any patient with a complete or partial response at the index site but a progressive 
response at the secondary sites will be considered a non-responder.    
13.4.[ADDRESS_677697] 3 points on the rating 
scale (and no increase in the pain score at any other treated lesion[s], with no increase in 
narcotic pain medication). Complete pain relief is defined as a score of 0 on the rating scale, 
with no increase in narcotic pain medication.   
 
 
RTOG 0631, version date 09/23/16 37  All eligible, randomized patients will be included in the analysis regardless of treatment 
compliance (intent- to-treat analysis) . Although missing assessments should be minimized due 
to current improved data collection methods, up to 10% of patients are still expected not to be 
assessed. These patients will be included in the analysis and will be initially assumed to have 
the similar response rate as the assessed patients with the same baseline pain scores .  
 
 W
e hypothesize that the use of radiosurgery will increase the percentage of patients 
experiencing a complete or partial response at 3 months from the 51% response rate achieved 
from conventional radiotherapy to 70% with image-guided radiosurgery/SBRT, a relative 
increase of 40%.

differences in the response rate. Sensitivity analyses of this result using other ways of imputing 
pain responses for the non-assessed patients (such as all classified as nonresponders or 
responders) will be performed. Subset analyses based on the number of treated sites also will 
be performed. Descriptive statistics of the actual change scores will also be provided. The 
mean change score and standard deviations will be reported.

hypotheses are: 
 
   H 0:  S 1(t)  =S 2 (t)      vs.         H A:  S 1 (t) > S 2 (t)  
where S i (t) is the distribution of response times for patients in arm i 
 
The stratified log-rank test will be used to test for a statistically significant difference in 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_522395]=0.025 (Mantel 1966). In addition, the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model will be used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals for the treatment difference (1972). Unadjusted ratios and ratios adjusted for 
stratification variables and other covariates of interest will be computed. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_677700] 3 points, 
and pain response ends when the pain score increases by 3 points or when narcotic pain 
medication increases. Patients dying without a reported pain relapse will be censored at 
the day of death. The median duration pain response will be estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier approach (Kaplan 1958).  The null and alternative hypotheses are: 
 
   H 0:  S 1(t)  = S 2 (t)      vs.         H A:  S 1 (t) > S 2 (t)  
where S i (t) is the distribution of response duration times for patients in arm i 
 
The stratified log-rank test will be used to test for a statistically significant difference in 
duration distributions with alpha=0.025 (Mantel 1966). In addition, the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model will be used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals for the treatment difference (1972). Unadjusted ratios and ratios adjusted for 
stratification variables and other covariates of interest will be computed. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_677701] at the 0.05 significance level. 
Univariate logistic regression will be used to model the distribution of acute adverse 
events.  Multivariate logistic regression will be used to model the distribution of acute 
adverse events, adjusting for covariates, including, but not limited to treatment arm, prior 
use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], time since completion of chemotherapy and/or radiation, and age. Both

computed (Hosmer 2000) .  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_677702] of the exclusion. Imputation methods will be used to 
determine values for all alive patients missing assessments. Multiple imputation 
procedures provide a valid strategy for dealing with missing data sets, properly reflecting 
the uncertainty due to missing values.  The possible strategies for imputation and analyses 
will depend on the severity of the missing data problem and missing pattern (MNAR, MAR, 
MCAR) [Little 2002]. 
 
Patient scores on the FACT subscale range from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating 
improved quality of life. The change scores from pretreatment to 3 months will be 
compared between the treatment arms. A mean difference of 7 points represents a 
clinically meaningful change (CMC). A difference of less than [ADDRESS_677703] for these varying baseline values. A 7 point CMC 
corresponds to varying percentage changes, depending on the baseline values. The null 
and alternative hypotheses are: 
H0:  ∆μ 1 = ∆μ2       vs.         H A:  ∆μ 1 > ∆μ2   
  where ∆μ i is the mean FACT change score from  baseline to [ADDRESS_677704] the hypothesis. 
 
In addition to change in QOL at 3 months after treatment, the overall trends in pain [Brief 
Pain Inventory (BPI)], QOL (FACT-G), and health utilities [EuroQol (EQ-5D)] will be 
described with longitudinal data analysis. All indicators will be assessed pretreatment and 
at 3, 12, and [ADDRESS_677705] (Verbeke 2000). 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_677706] is the 
relationship between treatment response and QOL. In RTOG 9714, sixty-six percent 
(167/253) of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522396]-month 
FACT-G while 34% did not. The distributions of pretreatment variables for the patients with 
and without both FACT-G assessments were similar. Patients with pain relief showed 
significantly more improvement in the FACT-G total score, most of which was due to 
improvements seen in both the functional well-being (FWB) and the physical well-being 
(PWB) subscales. The difference in mean change scores between responders and 
nonresponders was 9.8 [95% CI (2.3, 17.3), p=0.01] for the FACT-G total score. 
Therefore, the change scores from pretreatment to [ADDRESS_677707]-treatment between 
patients who respond to treatment and patients who do not respond to treatment will be 
compared in RTOG 0631. The null and alternative hypotheses are: 
H0:  ∆μ 1 = ∆μ2       vs.         H A:  ∆μ 1 > ∆μ2   
  where ∆μ i is the mean FACT change score from  baseline to [ADDRESS_677708] the hypothesis.

13.5 Interim Reports to Monitor the Study Progress  
 Interim reports with descriptive statistics will be prepared twice a year until the initial paper 
reporting the treatment results has been accepted for publication. In general, the interim reports 
will contain information about the patient accrual rate with a projected completion date for the 
accrual phase; data quality; compliance rate of treatment delivery with the distributions of 
important prognostic baseline variables; and the frequencies and severity of adverse events. The 
interim reports will not contain treatment efficacy results with respect to the primary or the 
secondary endpoints.  
 
The NRG Oncology Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the phase II 
component of the study for safety and feasibility. The NRG Oncology Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) will monitor the phase III component of the study for safety and efficacy.  
 
 This study also will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS) , v. 3.0. Quarterly 
CDUS reports are submitted electronically.  
 
13.6 Reporting the Initial Treatment Results   
 The primary hypothesis of this study is to determine the efficacy of image-guided 
radiosurgery/SBRT in treating painful spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278].  This initial efficacy analysis will occur 
after each patient has been potentially followed for at least [ADDRESS_677709] 24 months. The analyses will include tabulation of all cases entered and 
those excluded from the analyses with the reasons for such given; the distribution of the 
important prognostic baseline variables; and observed results with respect to the primary and the 
secondary endpoints. The primary hypothesis of radiosurgery benefit will be tested using t he 
exact binomial test as specified in the analysis plan (Section 13.4.2). Also, where feasible, 
comparisons with respect to all endpoints will be made by [CONTACT_522452], racial, and ethnic 
category. 
 
13.7 Gender and Minorities  (4/21/14) 
In conformance with the national Institutes of Health (NIH)  Revitalization Act of [ADDRESS_677710] 
to inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research, participation rates of women and 
minorities will be examined during the interim reports. Based on accrual statistics from RTO G 
9714, the projected accrual by [CONTACT_547], race, and ethnicity for both phases is shown below:

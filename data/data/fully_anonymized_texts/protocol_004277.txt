AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:  
Study inclusion criteria have been revised to  account for recent changes in the standard of 
care for advanced lung cancer due to the recent approval of nivolumab as second -line 
therapy for NSCLC  after failure on platinum -based chemotherapy . Hence inclusion 
criteri on 3.1.6  has been revised to ensure continued accrual on this study.    
 
Other changes  
The Time and Events Table (Section 6.1) has been revised to reduce the number of times 
blood is collected for analysis of p16ink4. The Time and Events Table (Section 6.1) has 
been revised so that blood collection for p16 ink4 analyses occur at screening ,  on cycle 3 
D1,  cycle 5 D1 , and at the end of treatment  rather than at screening ,  on Day 1 of odd 
numbered cycles, before chemotherapy begin ning with cycle 3 , and at the end of 
treatment .

AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:  
The driver  for this amendment was the need to make inclusion and exclusion criteria 
consistent with regards to amount of time that should lapse between  radiation therapy and 
study treatment.  As such, exclusion criterion 3.2.5 has been changed to “no radiation 
withi n 2 weeks’ prior to study start. ” In addition, the primary endpoint (≥Grade 3 
treatment related toxicity) was slightly revised to clarify that we will focus on clinically 
significant toxicities and that those of doubtful importance, such as asymptomatic gr ade 3 
lymphopenia will not be included .  This change was made in sections 1.1, 2.4.1 , 6.10  and 
8.1. 
 
Other changes : 
 
Deleted Appendix B. Abraxane® in Metastatic Breast Cancer, as more recent information 
is available in the package insert, which is referenced in the protocol.  
 
Section 4.4.[ADDRESS_872360] for drug shipments (section 5.1.5)

AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:  
The driver  for this amendment is a change in the frequency of protocol -mand ated patient 
evaluations on days [ADDRESS_872361] ed in sections 6.0 and 6.3 .  
 
Other changes  
Nab-paclitaxel is now indicated (as of October 2012) for the treatment of first line 
treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in combination with carboplatin.  
This is reflected throughout the protocol, and section 5.1 .6 now includes clinical safety 
information on the use of nab -paclitaxel for this indication.  
 
The text from Section 4.3.2  (Permitted Medications) was moved to section 4.3  
(Supportive Care Guidelines); section 4.3.2  was deleted as it was redundant with section 
4.5 (Concomitant Medications/Treatments).  
 
Section 6.11.5 -removed reference to required confirmation of response rate as this is 
appropriate only when primary endpoint is response.  
 
Sections 4.6, 6.11.1, 6.11.3, and 9.4 were slightly revised to match updated LCCC 
protocol template.  Section 4.9 (Study Withdrawal)  was added to match updated LCCC 
protocol template.

1 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This will be a non -randomized phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy o f 
weekly  nab-paclitaxel for second -line treatment in 42 elderly (≥ 70 years of age) 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ).  Patients will be required to 
have progressed on a single prior regimen.  Nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 will be 
administered intravenously, weekly for 3 weeks of every 4-week  cycle.   After 
every two cycles of therapy, imaging will be performed to assess for response.  
Patients will be eligible to continue receiving therapy until the time of disease 
progressi on.   
 
The primary endpoint will be occurrence of  clinically significant  ≥Grade 3 nab-
paclitaxel -related toxicit ies (specifically neuropathy, myalgia, arthralgia, 
neutropenia , thrombocytopenia and anemia) a s well as any ≥Grade 3  unexpected 
toxicities  deeme d clinically significant and considered related to nab -paclitaxel by 
[CONTACT_1963] .  Secondary endpoints include overall survival ; progressi on-
free survival ; response rate ; quality of life  (QoL) ; and correlation of component 
scores of the Geriatri c Assessment and p16 INK4a levels with treatment outcomes 
and toxicity.  
1.2 Lung Cancer  in the Elderly  
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in the [LOCATION_002] 
and throughout the world .[1]  The majority of patients with lung cancer will have 
NSCLC subtype, and will present with advanced stage disease. [2, 3] The goals of 
treatment for patients with advanced s tage disease are to extend overall survival 
(OS), improve quality of life (Qo L) and reduce disease related symptoms .  
Cytotoxic chemotherapy is the primary therapy for the majority of patients.  The 
median age of patients with advanced NSCLC in the [LOCATION_002] is 71 years. [4]  
The number of elderly patients with advanced NSCLC is expected to increase as 
the size of the elderly population increases reflecting improvements in life 
expectancy and demographic trends. [5] 
1.2.[ADDRESS_872368] -line Treatment of the Elderly Patient with Advanced NSCLC  
A variety of subgroup analyses and p opulation -based studies provide d evidence 
that the fit elderly patient should be treated with doublet chemotherapy, but this 
remained unproven until the 2010 presentation of the Quiox study  of patients aged 
70-89 with advanced NSCLC .  This phase III trial compared carboplatin monthly 
combined with weekly paclitaxel to single agent therapy (gemcitabine or 
vinorelbine); the primary end -point was OS. [6, 7] Patients assigned to the doubl e-
agent arm experienced an improvement in progression -free (6.3 vs. 3.2 months, 
HR=0.55, p<0.001) and OS (10.4 vs. 6.2 months, HR=0.6, p = 0.0001).  Patients in 
the double agent arm compared to the single agent arm experienced a statistically 
significant h igher rate of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and sensory neuropathy. The rate of treatment -related deaths 
LCCC 1210   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_650640] 26 , 201 7 (Amendment 04)   
2 was significantly higher in the double agent compared to the single agent arm 
(6.62% vs. 1.83%, p=0.035).    
1.2.[ADDRESS_872369] been evaluated in NSCLC , and shown similar survival benefits to 
carboplatin/paclitaxel .  The recently published Scagliotti [8] trial was designed to 
show  and confirmed  non-inferiority for the combination of cisplatin plus 
pemetrexed as compared to cisplatin plus gemcitabine.  Similar to the 
carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet, median OS for both regimens was 10.3 months.  
However, based on a planned subset analysis, the combination of cisplatin plus 
pemetrexed improved OS among patients with  non-squamous histolog y; 
conversely  the combination of cisplatin plus gemcitabine was more effective i n 
patients with squamous histology.  
 
Given the high tolerability and efficacy of both pemetrexed and gemcitabine, 
many clinicians consider the potential improvement of the therapeutic index with 
histology -directed therapy particularly applicable to the el derly patient.  Thus, 
many clinicians routinely treat fit elderly patients in the first line with squamous 
cell NSCLC with gemcitabine plus carboplatin and non -squamous NSCLC with 
pemetrexed plus carboplatin.  
1.2.3 Second -Line Treatment of the Elderly Patient wi th Advanced NSCLC  
There are currently two cytotoxic agents, pemetrexed and docetaxel, and one 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor  (TKI: 
erlotinib ) that are available for use in U.S. patients with NSCLC who have 
experienced dis ease progression during or after initial chemotherapy. [9-13]  No 
prospective, elderly -specific trials have been performed to define either the merits 
of second line therapy in the elderly, or choice of agent.  A limited number of 
subset analyses have b een performed.  
 
A subset analysis of elderly patients (n=86, 15% of patients enrolled) in a phase 
III trial comparing docetaxel to pemetrexed was performed.  Elderly patients 
assigned to pemetrexed (n=47) compared to the docetaxel arm (n=39) 
experienced a  numerically longer OS (HR=0.66, 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.42; median 
9.5 and 7.7 months, respectively). [14]  This analysis was performed before it was 
known that the efficacy of pemetrexed was restricted to tumors with non -
squamous histology and the number of elderly pat ients in each treatment arm was 
small.  The rate of grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia among elderly patients was 
substantially lower in patients in the pemetrexed arm compared to the docetaxel 
arm, 2.5% and 19% (p=0.025).  While pemetrexed  appeared more effecti ve, and  
is better tolerated , most patients with non -squamous histology will have received 
pemetrexed for their first line treatment, thus reducing the choices of tolerable 
therapy for second -line. 
 
LCCC 1210   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_650640] 26 , 201 7 (Amendment 04)   
3 Another  subset analysis was performed of elderly (≥ 70 yea rs) patients enrolled in 
a phase III trial of erlotinib compared to placebo  in patients who progressed after 
first-line chemotherapy. [15] Of the 731 patients enrolled, 163 patients were 
elderly (112 in the erlotinib arm and  51 in the placebo arm).  Elderly patients 
compared to younger patients experienced more grade 3 or 4 toxicity (35% vs. 
18%; p< 0.001), were more likely to discontinue treatment (12% vs. 3%; 
p<0.0001), and had a lower relative dose intensity (64% vs. 82% r eceived >90% 
of the planned dose; p<0.001).  Elderly patients receiving erlotinib compared to 
placebo experienced numerically longer OS (HR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.34; 
p=0.67; median OS 7.6 and 5.0 months, respectively).  Therefore despi[INVESTIGATOR_650641] l with erlotinib, there was a significant increase in Grade 3/4 
toxicity and increased likelihood for discontinuation of treatment.   Additional, 
more easily tolerated options are needed for second -line treatment of NSCLC in 
the elderly.  
1.3 Nab-Paclitaxel  (Abr axane ®) 
The active cytotoxic agent in nanoalbumin bound paclitaxel (henceforth n ab-
paclitaxel ) is paclitaxel, an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of 
microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by [CONTACT_374121] .  This agent is currently indicated for the treatment of 
previously treated metastatic breast cancer, or disease that has relapsed within [ADDRESS_872370] -line 
treatment in combination with carboplatin.  
 
Nab-paclitaxel delivers the paclitaxel bound to albumin and has several 
theoretic al advant ages over paclitaxel  [16].  First, the crem ophor solvent is not 
needed.  Crem ophor requires special glass or non -PVC infusion systems, 
premedication with histamine 1 and 2 blockers, can cause infusio n reactions and 
may contribute to peripheral neuropathy.  As albumin facilitates the 
administration of the water -insoluble compounds, effective active dose -delivery is 
higher, by [CONTACT_45848] 49%.  Infusion time with nab -paclitaxel is faster than with 
paclit axel.  Finally, binding of the active drug to albumin may increase tumor -
specificity.  
 
Lung cancer  
Results were recently presented from  a randomized international Phase III trial 
that compared four cycles of first-line carboplatin plus paclitaxel to four cycles of 
carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel in NSCLC .  The nab -paclitaxel  arm showed 
improved response rate s (RR 33%) compared to standard paclitaxel when 
combined with carboplatin  (25%)  [17, 18].  Importantly, most of this 
improvement was a result of improved response in patients with squamous cell 
histology, where the RR improved from 24% to 41%.  Although effective dose 
delivery was higher with nab -paclitaxel (82 mg/m2/week) compared to standard 
paclitaxel (65 mg/m2/week) the overall toxicity profile , with the exception of 
anemia and thrombocytopenia,  favored nab -paclita xel as shown in Table 1 .

pemetrexed for non -squamous NSCLC .  Some elderly patients are treated with 
paclitaxel  in combination with a platinum .   
 
The fit elderly are of ten not offered second -line treatment based on concern for 
toxicity.  When elderly patients with advanced NSCLC are offered second -line 
therapy, the choice of therapy is frequently based on avoidance of toxicity rather 
than on disease -related endpoints.  I n particular, the one taxane that is FDA 
approved for second -line use, d ocetaxel, is widely considered too toxic for use in 
the elderly.   
 
We hypothesize that treatment with single -agent, weekly administration of nab -
paclitaxel will be tolerable and assoc iated with a favorable clinical response  (as 
compared to a historical control)  in elderly patients undergoing second -line 
therapy for advanced NSCLC.  
 
Data suggest that weekly taxane administration improves tolerability  over an 
every [ADDRESS_872372] every three week regimen (with both drugs given on day one) to a four 
week cycle (with carboplatin given on day 1 and paclitaxel given weekly for 
weeks one to three)  [20].  Survival was similar between the two arms, but non -
hematologic toxicity favored the weekly taxane arm.  A dose findin g study 
conducted at this institution showed a favorable benefit to risk ratio with weekly

6 nab-paclitaxel at a dose of 100mg/m2 when administered in combination with 
carboplatin  [21]. 
 
Taxanes on a weekly schedule have been shown to be particularly effective  as 
first-line therapy  in the elderly.  The superiority of doublet chemotherapy over 
single -agent chemotherapy in the elderly was recently demonstrated using a 
regimen  of carboplatin at an AUC of 6, combined with paclitaxel at 90mg/m2 
weekly [7].  A recent phase III study compared carboplatin plus paclitaxel on an 
every three week schedule to carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel at 100mg/m2 given 
weekly —the subgroup analysis of elderly patients was particularly favorable 
towards the weekly regimen [17].   
 
Based on these data, we propose a single arm phase II study of weekly nab -
paclitaxel in the elderly second -line NSCLC population.   Nab -paclitaxel will be 
dosed at 100mg/m2 weekly, for 3 weeks of every 4-week  cycle, with  cycles 
repeated until progressive disease.   
1.5 Correlative Studies  
1.5.1 Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment  
While the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky 
Performance Status (PS) tools are easy and quick to use, they measure only one 
domain of functioning and thus lack sensitivity for frailty.  More comprehensive  
evaluation with a geriatric assessment (GA) tool can provide more complete 
information regarding functional status, co -morbid medical conditions, 
psychological state, social support, nu tritional status, cognition, and medications.  
This information can potentially improve the therapeutic index of therapy by 
[CONTACT_650659].  C omprehensive GA is well 
accepted by [CONTACT_1962]. [22]  Baseline GAs will be performed in all patients enrolled 
into this trial, and components of the GA will be explored as predictors of 
chemo therapy tolerance and overall survival . 
1.5.2 Biologic Assessment of Physiologic Age  and p16INK4a 
The protein, p 16INK4a, is a tumor suppressor which originates from the INK4/ARF 
locus on chromosome 9p21.  Recently, p16INK4a expression has been proposed as 
a mark er of physiologic aging. Levels of p16INK4a increase nearly tenfold over 
sixty years. [23]  In addition to correlating with age, p 16INK4a is associated with 
tobacco use and physical inactivity, two factors positively associated with an 
increased risk of age -related diseases.  This suggests that p16INK4a may be a 
marker not simply of chronologic age, but rather physiologic age.  In patients over 
65 years of age, treatment with chemotherapy increases p 16INK4a to a similar 
extent as ten years of aging .[24]  Levels of p16INK4a will be drawn serially across 
the trial, and results explored as predictors of chemotherapy  tolerance and overall 
survival.   Based on the previously reported correlation between p 16INK4a  and 
factors  associated with age -related disease ( e.g., tobacco use, physical inactivity), 
we will also include a brief health behavior s questionnaire, to capture the baseline 
level of physical activity, smoking habits and alcohol consumption.  These data 
will be used to explore correlations with changes in p16INK4a expression.

Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) [25] 
The LCSS  is designed as a site -specific measure of quality of life (Q oL), 
particularly for use in clinical trials.  The LCSS is designed fo r use in patients 
with lung cancer , capturing QoL factors most related to treatment and changes in 
the disease state.  It evaluates six major symptoms associated with lung 
malignancies and their effect on overall symptomatic distress, functi onal 
activities , and global Q oL.  The LCSS consists of a nine-item patient -rating scale 
and a six -item observer rating scale.  
 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Lung (FACT -L) Scale   
The FACT -L is a validated,  multidimensional, self -report QoL instrument 
specificall y designed for use  with lung cancer patients [26]. It consists of 2 7 core 
items which assess patient  function in four domains: Physical, Social/Family, 
Emotional, and Functional well -being, which  is further supplemented by 9 site 
specific items to assess for lung cancer related symptoms.   Each item is rated on a 
5-point  Likert type scale, and then combined to prod uce subscale scores for  each 
domain, as well as a global QoL score.  
1.5.4 Sarcopenia assessment  
Sarcopenia has been shown to be associated with poor survival in older cancer 
patients (PMID: 26882087 ).  Sarcopenia, as measured by [CONTACT_650660], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650643] [ADDRESS_872373] cancer patients 
treated with various taxanes; a weakness of the work was heterogeneity in taxane 
treatment  (PMID: 27489287 ). While abdom inal imaging is preferred, chest CT 
has been previously used to evaluate sarcopenia in lung cancer patients ( PMID: 
27364150 ) and it correlates with lumbar results obtained from abdominal 
imaging.

11 4.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Schema  
 
This is a s ingle arm, non -randomized, Phase II study evaluating the tolerability of 
weekly nab -paclit axel as second line treatment in 42 elderly patients with 
advanced lung cancer.  Patients will receive nab -paclitaxel once weekly (days 1, 8 
and 15 ) for 3 weeks of every 4-week cycle.  After every 2 cycles, tumor 
measurements  will be assessed  for response .  Patients will continue treatment 
until disease progression.  Following discontinuation of treatment, patients will be 
followed for up to 2 years .  Section 6.0 (time and events table) outlines the study 
assessments and correlative studies, including the GA (baseline  and end of 
treatment ), Health Behavior s questionnaire (baseline), QoL questionnaires 
(serially across the trial), and blood levels for evaluation of p 16INK4a  (serially 
across the trial).  See sections 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, and 6.9 for additional information on 
these correlative studies.  
 
The average duration of active patient participation in this study  is expected to be 
approximately 3- 4 cycles (i.e., 3 to 4 months ).  This is based on median time to  
progression  of 2.9 months following  second -line treatment with docetaxel in 
elderly patients with adva nced NSCLC  [14].  Accrual  to this study  is expected to 
occur within 14 months . 
4.2 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
See Section 5.0 for more detailed information on nab -paclitaxel.  Refer to the Full 
Prescribing Information for nab -paclitaxel  for complete safety information :  
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/ (in addition to that already 
provided in sections 1.3, 5.0 and .  Dose modifications are described in section 
4.4.1 .

12 Nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 will be infused over 30 minutes  on Days 1, 8 and 15 of 
every 28-day cycle  (see Table 2) .  Actual body weight will be used for the dose 
calculation.  It is not a requirement to use in -line filters during the administration 
of nab-paclitaxel .  In any event, filters of pore -size less than [ADDRESS_872384] 
not be used.   If patient body weight changes  by >10%, recalculate the body 
surface area and dose of nab -paclitaxel.  Note:  Dose changes will apply for the 
next cycle ; dose s will no t be changed mid - cycle.  
 
Nab-paclitaxel should be prepared for intravenous administration according to 
instructions provided in the manufacturers’ Prescribing Information.

4.3 Supportive Care Guidelines  
All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded in the 
electronic case report form (e CRF ) with indication, dose  information, and dates of 
administration.  Subjects should receive full supportive care during the study, 
including transfusion of blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, 
antiemetics, and analgesics, as appropriate.  
 
4.3.1 Nab-paclitaxel Premedication  
Patients do not require premedication prior to nab -paclitaxel administration, as 
hypersensitivity reactions are rare.  
 
Administration of solvent -based taxanes (Taxol and Taxotere) requires 
premedication with corticosteroids and histamine receptor blocking agents to 
prevent the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions.  The solubilizing agents 
Cremophor® EL and Tween® [ADDRESS_872385] long been implicated in adverse events 
including hyperse nsitivity reactions due to their detergent -like nature and known 
ability to induce histamine release . [27]  However, the hypersensitizing role of the 
taxane molecules themselves cannot be ruled out.   
 
In the unlikely event of a mild hypersensitivity reaction, premedication may be 
administered using the premedication regimen the institution typi[INVESTIGATOR_192456].  
 
In the event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue nab -paclitaxel.

4.3.3 Hematopoietic Growth Factors  
Use of erythropoies is- stimulating agents (ESAs)  will neither be recommended 
nor prohibited.  If the clinician elects to utilize ESAs, they must be used within 
FDA -approved guidelines . The use of peg -filgrastim is not allowed in this study.   
The use of  prophylactic filgrasti m during chemotherapy is permitted at the 
discretion of the treating physician ; it is recommended  in patients with low blood 
counts that threaten treatment continuity.  It is strongly advised in patients who 
have previous febrile neutropenia or who have tr eatment delays due to 
neutropenia.  
When filgrastim is used, administer filgrastim  5 mcg/kg/day (rounded to the 
nearest vial size per investigator/institution’s standard of care).  The number of 
days of filgrastim  is up to the discretion of the treating MD;  however, the patient 
must start at least [ADDRESS_872387] 48 
hours prior to the next dose.  The dose of filgrastim  can be adjusted based on the 
investigator’s discretion. The delivery of G -CSF following week #3 of any cycle 
is per investigator discretion (since the patient will have a 2 week break prior to 
the next dose).  
4.4 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives  any treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for 
toxicity.  Each p atient will be assessed periodically for the development of any 
toxicity according to the Time and Events table  (Section  6.0).  Toxicity will be 
assessed according to the NCI Common T erminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), version 4.0.  Dose adjustments should be made according to the system 
showing the greatest degree of toxicity.  See Section 4.4.1  for suggested dose 
modifications and dose delays due to toxicity.  
 
If more than 2 dose reductions of nab -paclitaxel are required, protocol therapy is 
to be discontinued, response assessed, and the patient should proceed to optimal 
definitive therapy outside the constraints of the clinical trial.  Once a patient’s 
dose has been reduced, the do se reduction will be permanent.  D ose re -escalation 
will not be permitted.  
 
If a patient misses more than 28 consecutive days of treatm ent or more than 2 
cycle s of treatment due to toxicity, the patient will be removed from the study.   If 
the treating clinician feels that the patient has been benefitting from treatment 
with nab -paclitaxel and would benefit more from ongoing study therapy than 
another treatment, he/she may request an exemption from these requirements by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_650646] a case -by-case basis.

Hypersensitivity reactions to nab -paclitaxel rarely occur.  If they do occur, minor 
symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, lower back pain, 
hypotension, or tachycardia may require temporary interruption of the infusion.  
However, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment,  dyspnea 
requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or generalized urticaria require immediate 
discontinuation of nab-paclitaxel administration and aggressive symptomatic 
therapy.  Patients  who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction  to nab-
paclitaxel  should not be re -challenged.

(patient will be followed -up per protocol) : 
 The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn from the 
study  because of toxicity or other factors . If this decision is made because 
of a s erious adverse event or clinically significant laboratory value, the 
study drug is  to be discontinued and appropriate measures are to be taken.   
 The patient requests to be withdrawn from the study.  Patient to be 
followed -up per protocol unless patient refu ses 
 The patient for any reason requires treatment with another therapeutic 
agent (other than that specified by [CONTACT_760]) for their disease . In this 
case discontinuation from the study occurs immediately upon introduction 
of the new agent.  
 Evidence of p rogressive disease  
 Unacceptable toxicity . 
 The patient becomes pregnant or fails to use adequate birth control (for 
those patients able to conceive).  
 The patient is lost to follow -up; in this case patient will be removed from

4.9 Study Withdrawal  
If a patient decides to withdraw  from the study (and not just from protocol 
therapy)  all efforts should be made to complete and report study  assessments as 
thoroughly as possible. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_76409] a  
responsible relative by [CONTACT_353197] a personal vis it to establish as 
completely as  possible the reason for the study withdrawal. A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the  patient’s study withdrawal should be made with an 
explanation of why the patient is  withdrawing from the study. If the reason for 
removal of a patient from the study is an  adverse event, the principal specific 
event will be recorded on the eCRF.

Temperature reco rds for nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane® ) must be kept for verification 
of proper study drug storage.  
 
If storing reconstituted nab-paclitaxel  (Abraxane® ), some settling may occur. 
Ensure complete re -suspension by [CONTACT_131694].  
 
The suspension for infusion prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should 
be used immediately, but may be stored at ambient temperature (approximately 
25°C) and lighting conditions for up to  4 hours.   
5.1.2 Reconstitution of nab -paclitaxel  
Nab-paclitaxel  will be reconstituted  by [CONTACT_650662].  The 
investigator will calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient in order to 
determine the total amount of nab-paclitaxel to be admini stered.  
 Reconstitution and use of nab -paclitaxel:  
1. Calculate the patient’s body surface area at the beginning of the study and 
if the weight changes by >10% .  
2. Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by:  
[CONTACT_456376] (mg) = BSA x (study dose mg/m2) 
3. Calculate the total number of vials required by:  
[CONTACT_192488] =  Total Dose (mg)  
    100 mg/vial  
 
Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole 
number when a fractional number of vials is obtained by [CONTACT_650663] (e.g., if the total number of vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would 
be reconstituted).  
4. Using sterile tech nique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.  
5. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
6. Reconstitute each nab-paclitaxel  (Abraxane® ) vial by [CONTACT_227788] 20 mL of 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or equivalent into each vial over a 
period of not less than 1 mi nute (Note: change the syringes after 
reconstituting every 3 vials).  
 Slowly  inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 
over a minimum of 1 minute , using the sterile syringe directing the 
solution flow onto the inside wall  of the vial.  
 DO NOT  INJECT  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 
solution directly onto the lyophilized cake as this will result in 
foaming.  
 Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum

19 of 5 minutes  to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized 
cake/po wder.   
 Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly  for at least 2 minutes  until 
complete dissolution of any cake/powder occurs.  Avoid generation 
of foam.  Rapid agitation or shaking will result in foaming.  
 If foaming or clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_4095], stand solution for at least 15 
minutes until foam subsides.  
 Each mL of reconstituted product will contain [ADDRESS_872398] total dosing volume of 5 mg/mL suspension required 
for the patient:  Dosing volume (m L) = total dose (mg)/5 (mg/mL)  
8. The reconstituted sample should be milky and homogeneous without 
visible particulates.  If particulates or settling are  visible, the vial should 
be gently  inverted again to ensure complete resuspension, prior to use. 
Discard the reconstituted suspension if  precipi[INVESTIGATOR_192457].  
9. Once the exact volume  of reconstituted Abraxane ® has been withdrawn 
from the vials, discard any excess solution left over in accordance with 
standard operating procedures.  
10. Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the calculate d dosing volume of 
reconstituted Abraxane ® suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC 
IV bag using an injection port.  Inject perpendicularly into the center of 
the injection port to avoid dislodging plastic material into the IV bag.  
11. Administe r the cal culated dosing volume of reconstituted Abraxane ® 
suspension by [CONTACT_12781] 30 minutes.  The use of in -line filters is 
not recommended because the reconstituted solution may clog the filter.  
5.1.3 Dose and Schedule of nab -paclitaxel  
See section 4.2. 
5.1.4 Administration  
Nab-paclitaxel will be infused intravenously over  30 minutes . Actual  body weight

Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] :  Following treatment with nab-paclitaxel, dyspnea (12%), cough 
(7%) and pneumothorax (<1%) were reported  in the randomized Phase III trial in 
metastatic breast cancer.    
 
Neurologic:  Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with nab -paclitaxel (71% in 
the randomized clinical trial, 10%  severe).  It is dose -dependent, and increases 
with cumulative dose.   
 
Vision :  Ocular/visual disturbances occurred in 13% ; 1% were severe  and 
included  keratitis and blurred vision.    
 
Arthralgia/Myalgia :  Symptoms occurred in 44% of patients in the rando mized 
clinical trial (8%  of patients  experienced severe  symptoms ). 
 
Hepatic :  Exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased with hepatic 
impairment.  Grade 3 or 4 elevations in GGT occurred in 14% of patients  in the 
randomized Phase III trial . 
 
Rena l:  Elevated serum creatinine occurred in 11% (1% severe) of patients  in the 
randomized Phase III trial . 
 
General Toxicity Information  
 
Drug Interactions: No drug  interactions studies have been conducted with nab -
paclitaxel, a drug metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8 an d CYP3A4.  Ca ution should be used 
when administering nab -paclitaxel with medications known to inhibi t or induce 
either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.   
 
Injection site reactions:  These  reactions occur infrequently with nab -paclitaxel 
and were mild in the randomized clinical trial.  
 
Use in patients with hepatic impairment: The starting  dose of nab -paclitaxel 
should be reduced for patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.   
 
Use in pregnancy : Nab-paclitaxel is pregnancy category D.   Men should also be 
advised not to father a child while receiving treatment with nab -paclitaxel.    
 
Albumin: Nab-paclitaxel contains human albumin, and thus carries an extremely 
remote risk for tra nsmission of viral diseases, and Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease.    
 
Other potential risks associated with nab -paclitaxel include mucositis, 
bilirubin/liver enzyme elevations, edema, alopecia, asthenia , nail changes, 
dehydration and pyrexia .

A whole blood sample will be take n for p16INK4a (confirm drawn on same day as 
CBC with differential) .  The CBC with differential is necessary to normalize 
biomarker expression to the total lymphocyte count.  If CBC with differential 
already scheduled per standard of care on same day as bl ood draw for biomarker 
is scheduled, there is no need to repeat the CBC with differential.   
 
Processing of p16 blood samples:  
At the UNC site, after phlebotomy, the tube will be well -mixed and transported 
immediately to the Sharpless lab oratory in the Lineberger Cancer Center  for 
storage and processing.    
At external study sites, blood processing will be performed  after phlebotomy, to 
yield  a frozen T cell pellet .  The pellet will  be stored at -80 degrees C until ready 
for shipment  to the Sharpless laboratory for analysis.  Additional processing and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_650650] a study laboratory manual.  
 
Expression of p16INK4a is measured by [CONTACT_650665] -PCR.  
 
Blood s amples for CBC and p16INK4a will be collected  at baseline, on Day 1 of 
every odd numbered cycle  beginning with cycle 3, and at the end of treatment 
visit. 
 
We are currently examining how expression of other senescence markers change 
with age in our study of normal adults. Should we find changes in any  other 
senescence effectors we may perform exploratory analyses of these DNA markers 
(e.g. telomere length) and serum proteins in the future. Thus, excess serum and 
non-lymphoid cells remaining after assaying for p16INK4a  expression will be 
stored in the Sharpless laboratory  (Room # 21-225, Lineberger Comprehensive 
Cancer Center, CB #7295, University of North Carolina)  for potential future use.  
6.7 Geriatric Assessment (GA)  (Version 5)   
After completing some initial demographic  information, the first 3 formal items 
within the GA will be completed with the assistance of the study staff .   These 
include the Blessed Orientation -Memory -Concentration (BOMC) test, the 
Karnofsky Performance Status tool (KPS), and the Timed “Up and Go” test.  The 
BOMC consists of six questions designed to screen for macroscopic cognitive 
impairment [29]. The KPS is a general measure of patient independence in 
carrying out normal activities and self -care needs [29]. The Timed Up and Go is a 
performance test of physical mobility, and measures how long it takes the patient, 
in seconds, to stand up from a standard arm chair, walk a distance of 
approximately 10 feet, turn, walk back to the chair,  and sit down again. Together, 
these 3 items should take approximately 10 minutes to complete on average.   
 
Following completion of the external evaluation, the patient will complete the 
patient questionnaire.  After answering 7 questions on their background 
(additional demographic information, see section I of patient questionnaire), 
patients will complete section II which includes a number of assessments

Activities o f Daily Living (IADL, 7 questions), a subscale of the 
Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire (MFAQ):  Older 
American Resources and Services (OARS).  Each question is scored from 0 
(completely unable) to 2 (without help) and sums to a score of 0-14.  This is 
followed by [CONTACT_650666] (ADL, 10 items) subscale of the 
Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Physical Health.  Both the IADL questions and 
the ADL items are rated using a 3 -point Likert scale measuring the degree to 
which an activ ity can be performed independently (see Section II).   Also included 
in section II is a self -reporting version of the KPS, developed to assess the 
patient’s perception of their own performance status.  This involves patient 
selection of [ADDRESS_872412] describes their functional

Sections III & IV of the questionnaire include a co -morbidity scale (the Physical 
Health Section of the OARS) that contains a list of current illnesses and 
conditions an individual might have and the degree to which they impair daily 
activities, as well as a request for the patient to list all current medications they 
are taking.  A brief sect ion on nutrition follows, comprised of 3 brief questions.  
Section VI involves an assessment of psychological distress and well -being and 
includes 17 questions from The Mental Health Index (MHI -17).   
 
The formal GA finishes with separate evaluations of so cial functioning (via the 4 
question MOS Social Activity Limitations Measure) and social support (via the 
12 item MOS Social Support Survey: Emotional/Information and Tangible 
subscales).  
 
Once the GA is completed, the evaluation ends with 4 questions eva luating 
patient satisfaction with the self -administered portion of the GA.  
 
The Geriatric Assessment will be administered prior to treatment and at the end of 
treatment  visit.  (See Appendices, Section 11.1 below ) 
6.8 Health Behavior s Questionnaire  
Patients will be asked to complete a brief health behavior s questionnaire at study 
entry, regarding their smoking and exercise habits, and weekly alcohol 
consumption (see Appendices, section 11.2). 
6.9 Assessment of Quality of Life  
Quality of life will be evaluated using  the lung cancer symptom scale (LCSS ) and 
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Lung (FACT -L, Version 4 ) scale . 
 
LCSS  and FACT -L will be administered prior to treatment, before each  odd-

baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.   
 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non -
measurable lesions, will be considered non -measurable.  Lesions considered truly 
non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial 
effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/a bdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_236942].  
 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as clo se as 
possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should 
be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow -up.  Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical 
examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by [CONTACT_461].  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial an d ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. 
skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_310988] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended.  
6.11.2  Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 
two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified 
as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.   
 
Target lesions should be sele cted on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesion s, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is 
added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as refe rence to 
further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of 
the disease.  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should 
be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present” 
or “absent ,” or in rare cases “unequivocal progression .”

[ADDRESS_872419] 1.1 Criteria  
NOTE:  In addition to the information below, also see  section 4.3.2 in the 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_107330] (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228 -247) for 
special notes on the assessment of target lesions.  
 
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph node (LN) target or no must have decreased in short axis to <10mm.  
 
Partial response (PR) −At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target 
lesions  taking as reference the baseline sum L D. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD )−At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the 
target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started including baseline if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to 
the relative i ncrease of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5mm.  The appearance of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD.  
 
Stable disease (SD)− Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for P D taking as references the smallest sum LD since the 
treatment started.  
6.11.[ADDRESS_872420]  1.1 Criteria  
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker levels.  All LN must be non -pathological in size 
(<10mm short axis).   
 
Non-complete response (non -CR)/non -progression (non -PD)−Persistence of one 
or more  non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 
Progressive disease (PD) −Appearance of on e or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.

criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR).  Best 
response would depen d on whether minimum duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first 
time point.  Under these circumstances, the orig inal CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definition s  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical 
occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It 
may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or 
any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, including laboratory test 
values (as specified by [CONTACT_65801]), regardless of etiology. Any worsening 
LCCC 1210   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_650640] 26 , 201 7 (Amendment 04)   
33 (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a 
preexisting condition) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded on the AE page of the electronic case report from (e -CRF) 
rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. An 
overdose, accidental or in tentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE, or 
abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be 
reported as an AE. If an overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and 
adverse event should be reported as se parate terms.  
 
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:  
 results in discontinuation from the study;  
 requires treatment, modification/interruption of the dose of the drug, or 
any therapeutic intervention; or  
 is judged to be  of significant clinical importance.  
 
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a 
seriousness criterion need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
 
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrom e, then 
only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). If the abnormality was not a part of a 
diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the 
AE. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650651] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered 
AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be 
recorded as an AE, un less it is attributable by [CONTACT_353202].  
 
In this study, toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, available at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the dr ug is the cause.  Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any ad verse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, 
known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study tr eatment, other recent 
or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under 
investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions .  Other 
factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE:  
LCCC 1210   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_650640] 26 , 201 7 (Amendment 04)   
34  Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -
Johnson Syndrome)  
 One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated 
with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the po pulation (e.g., 
tendon rupture) ; often more than once occurrence from one or multiple 
studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is 
reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.   
 An aggregate analysis of specific events  observed in a clinical trial 
that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group 
than in a concurrent or historical control group  
7.1.[ADDRESS_872423] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of 
product characteristics for an approved product).   Unexp ected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation .   
7.1.4 Serious AE  or SAR  (or Pregnancy)  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
 Death;  
 Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the e vent as it occurred);  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
 Results in  congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to con duct normal life functions;  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the pa tient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences 
of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important 
medical event.  
 
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129298], central line insertion, metastasis interventional 
therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered 
serious adverse e vents.

treatment and continue through the 30 day follow -up period after treatment is 
discontinued.   
 
Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) for 
that patient.  Please include  a description of the event, its severity or toxicity 
grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study 
drug.     Documentation should occur at least monthly .  
7.3 SAE s or Serious SAR s (or Pregnancy -suspected or positive ) 
7.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs 
caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, etc).  
 
For any other experience or  condition that meets the definition of a n SAE or a  
serious SAR , recording of the event  must begin from day 1 of study treatment and 
continue through the 30 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued.  
7.3.2 Documentation  and Notification  
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded in  the SAE console  
within Oncore™ for that patient within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence .  To 
meet the requirements of Celgene (see section 7.3.4  below), all SAEs must also be 
recorded on a MedWatch3500A form  and faxed to Celgene .

7.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Princip al Investigator will  provide continuous monitoring of patient safety in 
this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSM C).  
 
Meetings/teleconferences  will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, 
and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings will include  the 
investigators  as well as protocol nurse s, clinical research associate s, regulatory 
associat es, data manager s, biostatistician s, and any other relevant personnel the 
principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research 
team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, 
safety, regulatory, and data collection.  
 
The team will produ ce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries 
will be available for inspection when requested by [CONTACT_544714], but

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a multicenter , single arm, phase II trial of [ADDRESS_872431] one prior regimen.  
 
The primary  study endpoint is clinically significant Grade 3 or higher toxicity  
associated with 6 cycles or 3 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, for those 
who come off treatment earlier .  Secondary endpoints include overall survival, 
progression -free survival, response rate, quality of life  and correlation of Geriatric 
Assessment measures  and p16 levels with treatment outcomes, overall grade 3 or 
higher toxicity, and specific toxicities.  
8.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
The null hypothesis that the rate of grade 3/4 /5 toxicity after 6 cycles (or 3 weeks 
after discontinuation of treatment, for those  who come off treatment earlier ) is 
60% will be tested against the one -sided alternative that the grade 3/4/5 toxicity 
rate is lower .  (Alternatively written, the null hypothesis that the toxicity -free rate 
is 40% will be tested against the one -sided alter native that the toxicity -free rate is 
higher than 40%.) A Simon’s two -stage design with a relaxed futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650654]. In the first stage, toxicity will be assessed after the second cycle, 
or [ADDRESS_872432] stage, 25 patients will be accrued.   If there are 10 or fewer patients that 
are grade 3/4/5  toxicity -free in these 25, the study will be stopped for futility. 
Otherwise, 17 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 42. The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if 2 3 or more patients are grade 3/4/5 toxicity -free 
LCCC 1210   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_650640] 26 , 201 7 (Amendment 04)   
39 after 6 cycles, or 3 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, for those who come 
off treatment earlier.  Assuming  that the toxicity -free rate after 2 cycles has a 
uniform distribution , uniform  (0, 0.3) under the null hypothesis , and can be at 
most 40% under the alternative , this design yields a type I error rate of at most 
0.[ADDRESS_872433] 80% when the true toxicity -free rate is 60%.  
 
The total accrual for this study  is 42 patients; the expected accrual rate is 3 
patients per month , and is expected to occur within 14 months.  
8.3 Data Analysi s Plans  
The percentage of patients with a grade 3 or higher toxicity  after 6 cycles  (or 3 
weeks after discontinuation of treatment, for tho se who come off treatment 
earlier ) and overall r esponse rate (as measured by [CONTACT_650672]1.1  criteria ) 
will be reported with an exact 95% confidence interval (CI) .  Progression -free 
survival and overall survival will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier met hod and 
median  with 95% CIs  will be reported.  
 
The association of baseline components of the GA  and p16  with the occurrence of 
a grade 3 or higher toxicity will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests 
for continuous variables and Fisher’s Exact test s for categorical variables.  Cox 
regression and the Kaplan -Meier Method will be used to evaluate associations 
with time to event analyses.  Longitudinal analyses will be used to explore the 
changes in LCSS  over the course of the study.   
 
9.[ADDRESS_872434] (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki.  
   
Before recruit ment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent 
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required 
by [CONTACT_44316]. Once this essential

42 9.5.3 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation  is any unplanned variance from an 
IRB approved protocol that:  
 Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
 Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
 Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan 
or the value of the data collected  
 Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator (s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance  meets 
any of the following criteria :  
 Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research 
participants.  
 Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
 Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
 Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal 
regulations, State laws, or University policies.  
 
If a deviation or violation occurs please follow t he guidelines below:  
 
For Institutions Relying on UNC’s IRB : 
Protocol Deviations: UNC or Affiliate personnel will record the deviation in 
OnCore®, and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in 
accordance with their policies.  Deviati ons should be summarized and reported to 
the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 
Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by [CONTACT_65478] 
(1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB 
online mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems.   
 
For Institutions Relying on Their Own IRB:  
In addition to adhering to the policies regarding protocol compliance set forth by 
[CONTACT_106954]’s IRB, the following is also required:  
 
Protocol Deviations: In the event a deviation from protocol procedures is 
identified,  record the deviation in OnCore®. 
 
Protocol Violations: Any protocol violation that occurs must be reported to your  
IRB per  institutional policies and reported to the UNCCN Study  Coordinator  
within 5 days . UNC -CH will  determine if the violation affects the safety of the 
patient and integrity of the data.   Once your institution’s IRB response is r eceived, 
please forward to the UNCCN Regulatory Associate.

by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB must also be reported to the UNCCN Study Coordinator.   The 
UNCCN Study Coordinator will report the event to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s 
web-based reporting system.  Examples of such UPs include a lost or stolen 
laptop computer that contains sensitive study information.

9.6 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be 
originated and documented by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_353190].  It should also 
be noted that when an amendment to the protocol sub stantially alters the study 
design or the potential risk to the patient, a revised consent form might be 
required.   
 
For Institutions Relying on UNC’s IRB : 
The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent 
to UNC’s IRB for approval prior to implementation.   
 
For Institutions Relying on Their Own IRB:  
Investigators must submit the UNC IRB approved amendment to their 
institution’s I RB for approval.  For multi -center studies, any affiliate site must 
submit their inf ormed consent revisions to the UNCCN Regulatory Associate  
prior to submission to their IRB.

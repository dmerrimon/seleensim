Oritavancin diphosphate        Clinical Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-[ADDRESS_905815], Dose and Mode of Administration:  
The investigational drug oritavancin diphosphate  (oritavancin) will be administered intravenously to all subjects . 
The dose is made up of three  single -use vial s, each  contain ing 400 mg of oritavancin  and the inactive 
component mannitol . At the time of use, each vial should be reconstituted by [CONTACT_1583] 40 mL of Sterile Water for 
Injection, [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia (USP). After reconstitution, oritavancin should be further diluted in 
approximately 1000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection (D5W).  
On Day [ADDRESS_905816] be infused over 3 hours.  No other material or diluent may be substituted or concomitantly 
infused through the same IV line.  
Duration of Treatment : Intravenous oritavancin will be administered in a single 1200mg intravenous dose.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Not applicable.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary outcome:  
 Safety of the administration of oritavancin in subjects on chronic warfarin will be assessed according to 
vital signs, laboratory abnormalities, and the incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs)  
Additional Safety Evaluation:  
Any changes in warfarin dosing  (for patients on warfarin therapy) , based on the PT/INR results or safety data 
will be recorded . If the PT/INR has not returned to therapeutic baseline by [CONTACT_2006] 14, patient will be referred to 
and followed by [CONTACT_670492]/INR monitoring . 
Secondary outcomes:  
 Clinical cure as an assessment of efficacy, determined by [CONTACT_63376] 48-72 hours after start of 
oritavancin dose  and at Day 7 
Exploratory  Outcome : 
 Potential for a ntibody development following a single dose oritavancin  administration  
Clinical evaluation time points:  
 Assessment of safety (adverse events and PT/INR  testing ) Days 1,  2, 3, 7 and 14  
 Early clinical efficacy evaluation at 48 to 72 hours from start of oritavancin administration  
 Post-therapy efficacy evaluation  at Day 7   
Statistical Methods: Approximately 25 subjects  on chronic warfarin therapy will be enrolled  (ITT population) .  
An additional group of 1 5 ABSSSI patients , who are not on chronic warfarin therapy , will also be enrolled.  
Sample size:  The sample size of 25 subjects  is chosen based on feasibility and clinical judgment to provide 
adequate safety information on the administration of oritavancin to subjects  with an ABSSSI who are on chronic 
warfarin.  An additional group of 15 ABSSSI patien ts who are not on chronic warfarin therapy was added to 
obtain information regarding potential for antibody production related to oritavancin administration.  
Analysis population : The patient populations are defined as follows:  
 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Popula tion: The ITT population will include all subjects  screened and enrolled  
 Safety Population: All subjects  dosed with IV oritavancin. The safety population will be the primary 
population for all the safety analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for  demographic, baseline characteristics, medical history, prior and 
concomitant medications.  Descriptive statistics include means, medians, standard deviations and ranges for 
continuous variables, as well as frequency and percentage for categorical variabl es.

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 1. INTRODUCTION  
This protocol describes a  multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the  safety of a single 1200 
mg IV d ose of Orbactiv (oritavancin) for the treatment of subjects  on concomitant chronic 
warfarin therapy being treated for an acute bacterial skin and skin st ructure infection  
(ABSSSI) .  An additional group  of fifteen patients will also be enrolled that are being treated 
for an ABSSSI and are NOT  on concomitant chronic warfarin therapy.  
Oritava ncin has been approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of adu lt patients with 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused or suspected to be caused 
by [CONTACT_670494] -positive microorganisms. An extensive clinical 
development program has been conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
oritavancin, comprising [ADDRESS_905827] been exposed t o oritavancin to date, including  1075 adult subjects with 
ABSSSI treated with a 1200 mg single dose regimen.  
1.1. BACKGROUND  
ABSSSI s are common infections that include cellulitis, major cutaneous abscesses, and 
wound infections. ABSSSIs are inflammatory microb ial invasions of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], 
dermis and subcutaneous tissues [ Dryden, 2009 ]. These infections are frequently 
caused by [CONTACT_6907] -positive bacteria including methicillin -susceptible S. aureus , 
methicillin -resistant S. aureus (MRSA) , Streptococcus pyogenes , and other β -hemolytic 
streptococcal species and enterococci.  The clinical complications of improperly treated 
or untreated ABSSSIs may include local expansion and spread, secondary bacteremia 
with potential for distant metastatic foci of infection, and sy stemic effects of bacterial 
infection.  
1.2. ORITAVANCIN  
Oritavancin is a novel semi -synthetic, lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that has three 
mechanisms of action : 1) inhibition of the transglycosylation (polymerization) step of 
cell wall biosynthesis by [CONTACT_670495]; 2) 
inhibition of the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by 
[CONTACT_670496]; and 3) disruption of bacterial 
membrane integrity, leading to d epolarization, permeabilization, and rapid cell death. 
These multiple mechanisms contribute to the rapid, concentration -dependent 
bactericidal activity of oritavancin.  
Oritavancin has been approved  by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA ) for the 
treatmen t of adult subjects with ABSSSIs  caused or suspected to be caused by

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 1.2.1.  Preclinical Studies  
Oritavancin has been extensively studied pre -clinically. The results from the 
safety, toxicology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies demonstrate 
that oritavancin does not induce any biologically significant toxicity .  An 
overview of relevant nonc linical study results  is presented in the Investigator’s 
Brochure [ Oritavancin Investigator’s Brochure  Version 10].   
1.2.2.  Summary of Clinical Pharmacology  
The pharmacokinetics of a single 1200 mg dose of oritavancin in ABSSSI 
subjects were determined from pop ulation pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled 
data from 297 adult subjects and are presented in Table  2. At steady state, 
oritavancin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at a dose up to 1200 mg. The 
mean, population -predicted oritavancin concentration -time profile displays a 
multi - exponential decline and a long terminal half -life of 245 hours.  Normal 
Healthy Volunteers administered a single 1200 mg dose of oritavancin 
experience higher oritavancin exposure when compared to pat ients; mean C max 
was approximately 25% higher in healthy volunteers and AUC 0-∞ was 
approximately 40% higher in healthy volunteers when compared to patients.

1.2.3.  Clinical Studies  
The clinical program of oritavancin comprises  four completed Phase  III studies, 
four Phase  II studies, fourteen  Phase  I studies in h ealthy subjects, and 
one Phase  I study in both healthy and hepatically -impaired subjects. Throughout 
the completed studies, IV oritavancin was administered to 3042 individuals 
(2632 subjects and 410 healt hy subjects)  [Oritavancin Investigator’s Brochure

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 Efficacy and safety findings of the intended treatment dose in adult subjects 
with ABSSSI are summarized below:  
Efficacy  
The results from SOLO I and SOLO II in 1959 adult patients demonstrate that a 
single 1200 mg IV dose of oritavancin is clinically non -inferior to 7 to 10 days 
of IV vancomycin (1 g or 15 mg/kg twice daily) using a pre -specified non -
inferiority margin of 10% for both early clinical response and clinical cure at 
post therapy ev aluation . The subject population was representative of ABSSSIs 
with S. aureus  the common causative pathogen isolated; a large subset of 
subjects (N=405) had documented MRSA infections. Efficacy in MRSA 
subjects was similar to that observed in the overall population for all endpoints.  
Safety  
The SOLO I and SOLO II studies demonstrat ed that a single 1200  mg IV dose 
of oritavancin is well tolerated and has a similar safety profile to 7 to 10  days of 
IV vancomycin treatment as demonstrated  by [CONTACT_670497], S erious Adverse Events ( SAE s) and

1.2.4.  Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
Twenty three clini cal trials, including four Phase III , four Phase II , and fifteen  
Phase I studies have been completed to date , in which  [ADDRESS_905828] common adverse events (>3%) by [CONTACT_670498], in the SOLO I or SOLO II studies were nausea, 
headache, vomiting, cellulitis, diarrh ea, constipation, infusion site extravasation, 
pyrexia and pruritus, as outlined in Table 4.  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of 
oritavancin . If an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during oritavancin  
infusion, disco ntinue oritavan cin immediately and institute appropriate 
supportive care. Due to the possibility of cross -sensitivity, carefully monitor for 
signs of hypersensitivity during ORBACTIV infusion in patients with a history 
of glycopeptide allergy. In the Phase  III ABSSSI clinical trials, the median 
onset of hypersensitivity reactions in oritavancin -treated patients was 1.[ADDRESS_905829] been reported w ith 
oritavancin including pruritus, urticaria or flushing. If reactions do occur, 
slowing or interrupting the infusion should be considered to mitigate the 
reaction.  
Oritavancin is a mild inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme ( CYP2C9 ), 
and therefore, has the potential to increase warfarin concentrations when 
administered concomitantly.  Oritavancin has been shown to artificially prolong 
PT and INR for up to [ADDRESS_905830] of warfarin unr eliable up to 24 hours after an oritav ancin dose. Subjects 
Oritavancin diphosphate  Clinic al Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-03 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 18 
The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 who are on warfarin (including all subjects in this trial) should be closely 
monitored for signs of bleeding . 
A complete description of relevant risks of oritavancin can be found in the 
investigator’s brochure [ Oritavancin Investigator’s Brochure  Version 10] and 
the [LOCATION_002] Package Insert ( USPI ). 
1.3. STUDY RATIONALE  
As noted above , oritavancin is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 based on a 31% increase 
(90% confidence interval ( CI) [1.294, 1. 345]) in the systemic exposure of S warfarin  
(TMC -ORI-12-03). Two additional studies are ongo ing; MDCO -ORI-14-[ADDRESS_905831] of a single 
1200 mg intravenous dose on numerous coagulation tests, including PT/INR, and 
MDCO -ORI-14-02 which is an additional Phase I  study in healthy volunteers assessing 
the magnitude and duration of the  pharmacokinetic  (PK) interaction between warfarin 
and oritavancin . Since warfarin is a drug with a narrow therapeutic index and some 
patients with ABSSSI may receive  oritavancin while on warfarin treatment, this study  
is being conducted to characterize the effect of oritavancin on clinical care and warfarin 
dosing.  The intention is to det ermine the magnitude and duration, if any, of alterations 
to warfarin dosing or of clinically important consequences of dosing with oritavancin . 
In the SOLO and SIMPLIFI trials, a total of [ADDRESS_905832] 
Coombs, and presence of oritavancin antibodies.     
The 1200 mg dose of oritavancin is the [LOCATION_002] (US) approved  therapeutic dose.

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 8. ADVERSE EVENTS   
8.1. DEFINITIONS  
8.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a 
subject or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign  (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a dmissions and/or surgical operations for an illness or disease 
that existed before the drug was given or the subject was enrolled  in a clinical 
study are not to be considered AEs.  
Subjects experiencing adverse events should be followed clinically until the ir 
health has returned to baseline status or until all parameters have returned to 
normal or have otherwise been explained.  It is expected that the investigator 
will provide or arrange appropriate supportive care for the subject if necessary.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  AE Severity  
The severity of an AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_093].  The 
investigator should ensure that any subject experiencing an AE 
receives appropriate medical support until the event resolves.  
AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated o n the 
case report form.  The intensity of an AE is defined as follows:  
1 = Mild:  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
2 = Moderate:  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily 
activity.  
3 = Severe:  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study Drug Causality  
The relationship of an AE to study treatment will be assessed with 
consideration to the following criteria:  
 Temporal relationship to the initiation of study medication  
 Response of the event to withdrawal of study medication  
 AE profile of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 Clinical circumstances during which the AE occurred  
Oritavancin diphosphate  Clinic al Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-03 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 34 
The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016  Subject’s clinical condition and medical history  
Categorization  of causality will be designated by [CONTACT_670503]:  
1. Unlikely relat ed - Lack of reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship - causal relationship between the event and the IMP. 
This means that there are little to no facts (evidence) or arguments 
to suggest a causal relationship . 
2. Reasonable Possibility  - Reasonable pos sibility of a causal 
relationship - causal relationship between the event and the IMP. 
This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest 
a causal relationship . 
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening, i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at 
immediate  risk of death from the event as it occurred (it does not include an 
event that, had i t occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death),  
 Results in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disruption in the subject's body function/structure, physical 
activities and/or quality of life,  
 Requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908],  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is another medically significant event that, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes listed above (e.g., allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency department or 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. Severity is an 
estimate or measure of the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs 
are indications of adverse subject outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A 
severe AE need not necessarily be considered serious and a serious AE need not 
be considered severe. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, a myocardial 
infarction (MI) that may be considere d minor could also be an SAE if it 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Oritavancin diphosphate  Clinic al Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-[ADDRESS_905845] be reported as an 
SAE. “Fatal” will be reported as the outcome for these events.  
8.1.3.  Medication Errors  
 Medication error refers to any unintend ed error in the dosing and 
administration of the study product as per instructions in the protocol.  
Medication Errors generally fall into 4 categories as follows:  
1. wrong medication  
2. wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, 
amount);  
3. wrong route of administration;  
4. wrong patient (i.e. not administered to the intended patient)  
Medication Errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study 
product(s), and misuse.  
Overdose:  Administration of a quantity of the study product given per 
administration or per day which is above the maximum recommended dose 
according to the reference safety information or protocol for the investigational 
product or comparator as applicable. This a lso takes into account cumulative 
effects due to overdose.  
Underdose:  Administration of a quantity of the study product given per 
administration or per day which is under the minimum recommended dose 
according to the reference safety information or protoc ol for the investigational 
product.  
Misuse: Intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product not in 
accordance with the prescribed or authorised dose, route of administration, 
and/or the indication(s) or not within the legal status of its supply ( e.g. without 
prescription for medicinal products subject to medical prescription).  
8.1.4.  Reporting Medication Errors  
Medication errors with or without an associated AE need to be recorded as 
medication errors in the eCRF as described in Section 8.2.  
Medication  errors with an associated SAE need to be recorded as medication 
errors in the eCRF and reported to MDCO Global Pharmacovigilance as 
described in Section 8.3.  
A mis -dosing protocol deviation (refer to Section 12.3 ) would need to be 
reported as a medicatio n error if it was an “unintended error” as defined in 
Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_905846]’s partner , 
including pregnancies detected anytime from administration  of oritavancin  until 
[ADDRESS_905847] 
(IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and/or national or local regulatory authoritie s. 
8.2. PROCEDURE FOR NON -SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENT RECORD ING  
All non -serious AEs that occur during the designated study period (from signing  the 
inform consent to 14 days following initial oritavancin administration ) must be assessed 
and recorded on the source documents and eCRF, regardless of causal relationship to 
the study drug.   
8.3. PROCEDURE FOR SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
All SAEs that occur during the designated study period ( from signing the inform ed 
consent  to 14 days following initial warfarin  administration ) must be reported to The 
Medicines Company (MDCO) within 24 hours of awareness of the event using the 
provided study specific SAE Report Form. The completion and processing of the SAE 
Report Form (paper ) should follow the instructions provided in the SAE Report Form 
completion guidelines.  In addition to completing the SAE Report Form, each SAE 
must be entered on the appropriate page of the eCRF.   
The investigator must assess the causality for each SAE.  
MDCO will contact [CONTACT_093], if necessary, to clarify any of the event 
information. The investigator should provide any follow -up information for the event to 
MDCO as soon as it becomes available.  
If the investigator is notified of a n SAE that occu rs during post-study period, that he or 
she wishes to report to the Sponsor (e.g., an event suspected to be causally related to 
study drug), the event should be reported through the process described above.

11. RECORDS RETENTION  
Current Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulations require all investigators 
participating in clinical drug trials to maintain detailed clinical data for one of the following 
periods:  
 At least 2 years following the dat e on which a New Drug Application is approved by [CONTACT_1556], or  
 Two years after the Sponsor notifies the investigator that no further applicat ion is to be 
filed with the FDA  
Similarly, International Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) guidelines require that es sential 
documen ts be retained until at least [ADDRESS_905853].  
To comply with these requirements, the investigator will not dispose of any records relevant to 
this study without either (1) written permission from the Sponsor or (2) providing an 
opportunity for the Sp onsor to collect such records. The investigator shall take responsibility 
for maintaining adequate and accurate hard copy source documents of all observations and data 
generated during this study, including any data clarification form s received from the Sponsor. 
Such documentation is subject to inspection by [CONTACT_76630], the FDA and/or other 
regulatory agencies.  
Oritavancin diphosphate  Clinic al Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-[ADDRESS_905854] es and applicable regulations. The 
investigator, as part of his responsibilities, is expected to cooperate with the Sponsor in 
ensuring that the stud y adheres to the protocol and GCP requirements.  
As part of a concerted effort to fulfill  these obligations, the Sponsor’ s monitor will visit 
the study center during the study in accordance with the Monitoring Plan set forth for 
this tr ial. The investigator  will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as 
is deemed necessary and provide access to medical records/source documents to ensure 
that data are being recorded adequately, that data are verifiable , and that protocol 
adherence is satisfacto ry. 
12.2. AUDITING  
The Sponsor may conduct audits at the study center s. Audits will include, but will not 
be limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent 
process, and comparison of eCRFs with source documents.  The investigator ag rees to 
permit audits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasonable manner.  
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also inspect the investiga tor during or after the 
study. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_76631], and must 
perm it regulatory authority inspections.  
12.3. PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for an emergency 
situation in which t he protection, safety, and well -being of the subject requires 
immediate intervention, based on the judgment of the investigator (or a responsible, 
appropriately trained professional d esignated by [CONTACT_093]).  
In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, 
or mistake, the investigator or designee must c ontact the Sponsor  (Clinical Project 
Director , Medical Director or Clinical Research Associate) at the earliest possible time. 
This will allow an early joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the study. 
The investigator and the Spons or will document this decision.  
The IRB/ EC will be informed of all protocol changes by [CONTACT_670508]/ EC-established procedure. No deviations from the protocol of any type 
will be made without complying with all IRB/ EC-established procedures.  
Any protocol deviations that will affect the subject’s safety or the study objectives may 
be considered a Major Protocol Deviation upon review by [CONTACT_1034].  In addition, 
any of t he following deviations will be considered Major Protocol Devia tions:

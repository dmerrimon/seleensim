 Treatment 2: moxidectin 8 mg (n = 10)  
 Treatment 3: moxidect in 16 mg (n = 10)  
 Treatment 4: moxidectin 24 mg (n = 10)  
 Treatment 5: moxidectin 36 mg (n = 10)  
 Treatment 6: matching placebo (n = 10)  
Subjects will provide written informed conse nt before under going  any 
study -related procedures. Subjects will be screened for eligibility up 
to 28 days before  randomization . Subjects who meet all of the 
inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be admitte d to the 
clinic al research unit (CRU) on Day  –1 (not less than 12 hours before

01 March  2017 Page 10 of 83 Version 2 .0 Study drug, dosage, and route of 
administration:  Moxidectin, 2 -mg tablets, administered orally  as a single dose of 4, 8, 
16, 24, or 36 mg  
Reference drug, dosage, and 
route of administration:  Placebo matched to moxidectin tablets , administered orally  as a single 
dose 
Pharmacodynamic assessments:  Pharmacodynamics will be assessed via ECGs obtained using a 
Mortara continuous [ADDRESS_132971] triplicate 10-second ECG recordings 
(approximately 1  minute apart) at the following time points: Baseline  
(before dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 , and 
72 hours after dosing.  The ECG extraction s will be time -matched to 
the PK samples  but obtained before the actual sampling time to avoid 
changes in autonomic tone associated with the psychological aspects 
of blood collection as well as the reduction in blood volume 
subsequent to blood collection.  
The continuous ECG data will be sent to the central ECG laboratory 
for a high -resolution measurement of the cardiac intervals and 
morphological assessment . The ECG core laboratory staff will be 
blinded to treatment , time, and study day identifiers . 
Pharmacokinetic assessments:  Blood samples  will be collected  to determine the PK of moxidectin 
and metabolites  in plasma . Blood samples will be collected for PK 
assessments at Baseline (0  hour; within 15 minutes before  dosing)  and 
at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4*, 5, 6, 8, 12*, 24*, 36*, 48, 60* , and 72  hours afte r 
dosing , and on Days  8, 15 , and 22. 
* Planned time  points for analysis of moxidectin metabolite 
concentrations  
Urine and fec es samples for PK assessments will be collected from 
each subject as follows :  
 Urine: B efore dosing  (single p re-dose collection ; first void 
sample in the morning is acceptable and volume recording is not 
required ) and for pooled intervals of 0 to 24, 24 to 48 , and 48 to 
72 hours after dosing  (4 samples)  
 Feces: Before dosing (single p re-dose collection *) and each 
bowel motion during confinement in the CRU . Sample s will be 
pooled at the central laboratory for intervals of 0 to 24, 24 to 48, 
and 48  to 72 hours after dosing  (up to 4 samples)  
* Feces specimens (the whole bowel movement) may be collected 
by [CONTACT_1766] (at home) within 2 days of submitting  them to study 
staff on Day –1. Collection instructions will be provided at 
Screening.  
Specific PK parameters for moxidectin in plasma will include:  
 AUC 0-last: area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) 
from time [ADDRESS_132972] observed concentration  
 AUC 0-inf: AUC  from time 0 extrapolated to infinity  
 cumAUC 0-t: cumulative AUC  from time 0 extrapolated to time t 
(where t  = 24, 48,  and 72 hours) 
 AUC 0-24: AUC  from time 0 to 24  hours after dosing  
 AUC 24-48: AUC  from 24 to 48  hours after dosing  
 AUC 48-72: AUC  from 48 to 72  hours after dosing

01 March  2017 Page 11 of 83 Version 2 .0  Cmax: maximu m observed plasma concentration  
 Tmax: time to maximum observed plasma concentration  
 t1/2: terminal elimination half -life 
Blood sampling time points will coincide with the ECG time points. 
The blood samples will be collected as close to the scheduled time 
point as possible, within 5 minutes and no later than 10 minutes after 
the ECG, unless otherwise noted.  
Additional PK parameters, including apparent clearance, volume of 
distributio n, and others may be determined as appropriate. The PK 
parameters will be expressed in units adjusted for molecular weight 
where appropriate.  
Safety assessments:  Safety and tolerability will be evaluated in terms of AEs, clinical 
laboratory test results  (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), 
vital sign  measurements (blood pressure, heart rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and oral body  temperature), safety 12-lead ECG results, and  physical 
examination findings.  
Sample size: The sample size of 60 subjects ( 10 subjects each in 6  treatment 
group s) is considered adequate to explore the effects of moxidectin on 
the QTc interval,  as this design will yield [ADDRESS_132973] completed dosing. 
Subjects who withdraw after dosing will not be replaced . 
Statistical methods:  For p urposes of statistical analysis, t his study is divided into 2 study 
periods:  
 Period 1: Commences at Screening and will finish on Day [ADDRESS_132974] has completed the study through Pe riod 1, the 
blind will be broken and the data from Period  1 will be analyzed.  
 Period 2: Period [ADDRESS_132975] comple ted the 
study through Week 12. Data for some subjects may be collected 
during Period  2 after the blind has been broken . 
Pharmacodynamics : 
The primary endpoint is the baseline -adjusted  QTcF ( dQTc F) 
matched to the plasma concentration of moxidectin collected at the 
same time point.  
The relationship between time -matched d QTcF and moxidectin 
concentrations will be investigated by [CONTACT_119267] -effects modeling. 
The ddQTcF value will be calculated as the placebo -corrected dQTcF 
estimated from the model.  
Before modeling, the concentration -ddQTcF relationship will be 
explored g raphically to determine the presence of hysteresis. 
Hysteresis will be assumed if, on average (or median), there are at 
least 3 time points with ddQTcF >5 msec and the time to maximum 
observed plasma concentration (T max) and the time of maximal 
ddQTcF (U max) differ by [ADDRESS_132976] for the difference between ddQTcF at T max 
and at U max is significant at the 1% level. If hysteresis is present, the 
possibility of fitting a population PK model with an effect 
compartm ent will be explored.  
Medicines Development for Global Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidenti al 
 
01 March  2017 Page 12 of 83 Version 2 .0 The primary analy sis will be provided for the ECG  population using a 
mixed -effects model with dQTcF as the dependent variable and 
treatment (active and placebo), time point, and treatment by [CONTACT_119268] v ariables with baseline QTcF as a 
covariate and time -matched concentrations of moxidectin (observed if 
hysteresis is not present; predicted from the effect compartment if 
hysteresis is present) as a covariate with random effects of intercept 
and slope. Conc entrations of zero will be used for the placebo 
treatment. A spatial power law covariance structure (a time -dependent 
first-order autoregressive covariance designed for unequally -spaced 
time points) will be used. If the model does not converge, then 
unstru ctured (UN) or compound symmetry (CS) structures will be 
assessed, in that order. The model will be used for predicting 
population average and 90% 2 -sided bootstrapped confidence interval 
(CI) of the baseline -adjusted difference (i.e., ddQTcF) between acti ve 
and placebo at each time point bound at clinically relevant 
concentrations. The bootstrap method will be based on percentile CI 
using the 5th and 95th percentiles in the resampling distribution using 
1000  iterations.  
The criterion for negative QT assess ment will be the upper bound of 
the 2 -sided 90% bootstrapped CI for ddQTcF being below [ADDRESS_132977] geometric mean C max value. In addition, the significance 
and magnitude of parameter estimates of the treatment covariate 
(active versus placebo) w ill be considered.  
Model assumptions will be reviewed with plots of standardized 
residuals versus fitted values and normal Q -Q plots of the 
standardized residuals. If nonlinearity is present, a log linear and/or 
maximum effect (E max) or other model will be  considered.  
Similar analyses will be repeated for HR, PR, and QRS, however, 
bootstrap percentiles will be based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, 
corresponding to a 2 -sided 95% CI rather than the 2 -sided 90% CI.  
Pharmacokinetics : 
Non-compartmental anal ysis will be implemented for the calculation 
of PK parameters. The main PK parameters of inte rest are the 
cumulative and pre -specified time -window AUCs  for moxid ectin 
concentrations in plasma.  
Computed PK parameters for moxidectin in plasma will be 
summari zed and listed for moxidectin , including mean , geometric 
mean , SD, median, and range,  as appropriate.  Moxidectin 
concentrations in urine and feces as well as plasma:urine and 
plasma:feces concentration ratios will be summarized.  
Summary  statistics describi ng the time course of concentrations of 
moxidectin metabolites and parent to metabolite ratios in plasma wil l 
be presented . Metabolite concentrations in urine as well as metabolite 
plasma:urine concentration ratios wil l be summarized as appropriate.  
Pharma cokinetic /Pharmacodynamic : 
To evaluate the relationship between placebo -corrected mean change 
from Baseline in QTcF ( i.e., ddQTcF) versus plasma concentrations 
of moxidectin for all subjects, both graphical and mixed -effects 
analyses of plasma concentratio n of ddQTcF versus plasma 
concentration of moxidectin will be performed. The mixed -effects 
model will contain ddQTcF as the dependent variable and include the 
corresponding moxidectin plasma concentrations as the independent 
variable. The mixed -effects mod el will be used to estimate, for all 
Medicines Development for Global Health   Moxidectin

01 March  2017 Page 13 of 83 Version 2 .0 subjects, the predicted population mean ddQTcF and its 
corresponding upper 95% 1 -sided CI over a range of observed plasma 
concentrations. A negative result ( i.e., the model indicates no plasma 
concentration effect) is a  slope of approximately zero.  
Safety : 
All safety assessments, including AEs, clinical laboratory test results, 
vital sign measurements, and safety 12 -lead ECG results will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics and presented in data listings. 
Physical examination findings and concomitant medications will be 
presented in data listings. All safety summary tables and figures will 
be generated using SAS®. No inferential statistics will be performed 
on the safety data.

01 March  2017 Page 20 of 83 Version 2 .0 3. Introduction  
3.1. Background  
Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a serious, debilitating, and stigmatizing parasitic 
disease caused by [CONTACT_119270]  (O. volvulus ). It is recognized as an 
important public health is sue by [CONTACT_119271]  (WHO)  and [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) as one of the neglected tr opi[INVESTIGATOR_119227] .1 
Onchocerciasis primarily affects individuals l iving in remot e and impoverished areas of 
low-income countries . More than 99% of the 37 million people with onchocerciasis 
globally  live in 31 sub -Saharan Africa n countries . It is estimated that 89  million people 
are at risk of infection. The disease also exists in some f oci in Latin America and Yemen.  
O. volvulus  larvae are transmitted to humans by [CONTACT_119272] (genus Simulium ), 
which breed in fast -flowing rivers and streams. The larvae develop into mature adult 
worms (macrofilariae)  and become encapsulated in skin nodules , from which they release 
millions of microfilariae that migrate through the skin and eyes, a critical step in the cycle 
of reinfection and disease perpetuation. Macrofilariae persist in the human body and have 
an estimated life  span of approximately 10 to 14 years .2 
The O. volvulus  microfilariae  cause the ocular and clinical manifestations of 
onchocerciasis. Symptoms include pruritus, dermatitis, depi[INVESTIGATOR_119228], lymphadenitis,  and visual impairment leading to blindness. Onchocerciasis is the 
second leading infectious cause of blindness in the world .3 In addition to substantial 
ocular and cutaneous morbidity, excess mortality of visually  impaired and non -impaired 
individuals with heavy onchocercal infection account ed for 5% of deaths in the 
Onchocerciasis Control Program (a WHO/United Nations collaboration that ran from 
1974 to 2002) area in West Africa .4-6 
The public health a nd socioeconomic importance of this disease in severely affected 
communities is also profound; the disease reduces income -generating capacity, incurs 
substantial health expenditures, and exerts a devastating socioeconomic effect on already 
challenged commu nities.  
3.2. Current Treatment and Unmet Need  
Ivermectin is a broad -spectrum endectocide that was approved by [CONTACT_119273] [ADDRESS_132982] of care. The 
recommended regimen for the treatment of onchocerciasis is  a single oral dose of 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 21 of 83 Version 2 .0 150 micrograms ( µg)/kilogram ( kg). In international treatment programs, the most 
commonly used dose interval is [ADDRESS_132983] -spectru m endectocide being developed 
for the treatment of onchocercia sis. During the d evelopment of moxidectin, extensive 
safety and metabolism stud ies were conducted in animals. Summaries of those studies 
considered relevant to the proposed clinical development a re included in the 
Investigator’ s Brochure.  
3.3.1 Non-Clinical  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamics  
The mechanism of action of moxidectin is multifaceted; studies indicate that moxidectin 
binds to gated chloride channels in the neurons and muscle cells of parasites, including 
glutamate and gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) -gated channels. Binding to the ion 
channel results in hyperpolarization of the nerve and muscle fibers, leading to paralysis 
and death of the parasitic organism. Specificity of moxidectin for the parasite versus the 
mammalian host is a result of this compound having low affinity for mammalian chloride 
channels. For more information, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 22 of 83 Version 2 .0 Moxidectin has been found to be 2 to 10 times more potent in nematodes than ivermectin 
on a dose -per-kg basis and to reduce the motility and viability of adult worms in vitro and 
in vivo . Moxidectin is minimally metabolized with a higher lipophilicity leading to 
deposition in adipose tissue, particularly skin subcutaneous fat . This is  reflected in its 
terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 20 to 43 days as opposed to 18 hours for 
ivermectin .17 The physicochemical differences of moxidectin compared with ivermectin 
result in a different pharmacodynamic  (PD)  profile for the parasite , and make moxidectin 
an imp ortant new potential treatment for onchocerciasis. In O. volvulus  infection , 
moxidectin is both microfilaricidal and affects the fecundity of adult worms.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Metabolism and Excretion  
The non -clinical pharmacokinetic  (PK) profile  of moxidectin, as profiled in rats and dogs, 
is characterized by [CONTACT_119274] (rats), low plasma clearance, and a high volume of 
distrib ution, leading to a long t 1/2. In radiolabeled absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion (ADME ) oral dosing studies in rats, moxidect in radioactivity was primarily 
eliminated in the feces. Most of the radioactivity was comprised of moxidectin, although 
oxidative m etabolites were also detected. Urinary ex cretion was low (<2%) in rats. These 
data indicate that moxidectin is likely cleared  by a combination of biliary excretion of 
unchanged drug  and oxidative metabolism.  
Moxidectin is not a potent P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) substrate or inhibitor and it is unlikely 
that clinical drug -drug interactions involving cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzyme inhibi tion 
or P-gp will occur. Results of studies in human  hepatocytes and using a 
CYP3A4 -luciferase reporter gene assay suggest that moxidectin is an inducer of CYP3A4 
at co ncentrations higher than 0.05  micromolar ( μM); therefore, a clinical drug -drug 
interaction study was conducted. Moxidectin did not have an effect on the PK of 
midazolam, a sen sitive CYP3A4 probe substrate. Therefore, although moxidectin can 
induce CYP3A4  in vitro , it is not an inducer in vivo  at the therapeutic dose. For further 
information, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_119229] -dose oral (capsule) study in adult and juvenile dogs designed to assess 
the planned clinical dosing regimen (once yearly administration), central nervous system 
(CNS )-related clinical signs were evident in both the adult and juvenile dogs after a 
single  dose at the hig hest dose evaluated (3 milligrams ( mg)/kg). In adult dogs (juvenile 
dogs discussed later), these observations included tremor s, ataxia, abnormal posture, 
decreased motor activity, salivation, emesis, increased vocalization, mydriasis, and 
retropulsion . These clinical signs were not considered adverse because they were 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -[ADDRESS_132984] 
level ( NOAEL ) in adult dogs was 3 mg/kg.  
In repeat -dose oral (diet) studies in mice, rats, and dogs, moxidectin was well tolerated at 
the NOAELs in each of these studies. The N OAEL was 6.9 mg/kg/day in the 4 -week 
mouse study, 12.2 mg/kg/day in the 4 -week rat study, 3.9 mg/kg/day in the 13 -week rat 
study , and 0.8 mg/kg/day in the [ADDRESS_132985] dose of 2.4 mg/kg/day included decreased 
colloid in the thyroid and decreased testes weight and spermatogenic activity, which  may 
have been related to the degree of maturation of the 5 - to 6-month old dogs as they were 
not observed in the 1 -year dog study. In the 13 -week and 1 -year studies in dogs, there 
were no adverse effects; therefore, the NOAELs were the highest doses teste d, 1.6 and 
1.1 mg/kg/day, respectively. The CNS -related clinical observations observed in the 
repeat -dose diet studies included tremors observed in all 3 species, at axia observed in rats 
and dogs, hypersensitivity to touch observed in mice and rats, and my driasis observed in 
dogs.  
Moxidectin was not genotoxic in a battery of genotoxicity assays, in vitro  or in vivo , and 
was not  carcinogenic in mice or rats. The reproductive NOAELs were 5 mg/kg/day in 
both the rat and rabbit developmental studies and at 5 parts per million ( ppm) 
(0.4 mg/kg/day) in the rat 3 -generation study. In female dogs administered a single 
subcutaneous  1.5-mg/kg injection of moxidectin canine sustained -release injectable 
formulation 1 month before mating, 1 day after mating, 28 days afte r mating, or 5 days 
after whelpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], there were no adverse effects on the female animals, breeding behavior, 
reproductive capacity, pup  survival, or pup body weight. The adverse fetal effects 
observed in the rat and rabbit toxicity studies occurred only in the presence of maternal 
toxicity. For further information, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The results of the non -clinical safety program supported the subsequent implementation 
of [ADDRESS_132986] since been conducted in adult and adolescent patients with 
onchocerciasis (see Section 3.3.2 ).

01 March  2017 Page 24 of 83 Version 2 .0 3.3.2 Clinical  
The moxidectin clinical program encompasses 7 completed single oral dose c linical 
studies spanning Phases 1 to 3. The PK  and safety data from these studies are 
summarized below. For further information , please refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
Moxidectin is a biopharmaceutics classification system Class [ADDRESS_132987] 24 to 48 hours 
following drug administration. Thereafter, plasma concentrations decline d slowly, in 
accordance with a long terminal half -life, likely due to sequestration in adipose and skin 
tissue. Administration of moxidectin with food resul ted in an increase in maximum 
observed plasma concentration ( Cmax) and area under the plasma -concentration time 
curve ( AUC ) of 34 % and 39% , respectively.  
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods with fluorescence detection 
were validated for t he quantitation of moxidectin in human plasma and breast milk. 
Based on a 0.5 -milliliter ( mL) sample volume, the assays were linear from 0.08 to 
120 nanograms ( ng)/mL. For further information , please refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Studies o f Moxidectin  
Moxidectin has been administered to 194 healthy volunteers in five Phase  1 studies, and 
in 1105 patients with onchocerciasis in one Phase 2 and one Phase 3 study. For further 
information , please refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
Phase 1 st udies of moxidectin evaluated single oral doses of 3 to 36 mg of moxidectin 
under fasted and fed conditions in healthy men and women. Moxidectin was well 
tolerated  across the dose range . All of the adverse events ( AEs) reported across all 
5 studies were mi ld to moderate in intensity, with the exception of one Grade 3 event 
(enteritis) in a subject who received 36 mg (which was deemed unrelated to test article). 
There were no Grade 4 events and no clinically relevant abnormalities observed in vital 
sign meas urements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or safety laboratory tests. None of the 
subjects died or experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) in any study, and there were 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -[ADDRESS_132988] commonly reported AEs in all subjects who took moxidectin were headache, 
infection/upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]/viral infection, nausea, pharyngitis, cough 
increased, rhi nitis leukopenia, dizziness, pain, aspartate aminotransferase increased, 
alanine aminotransferase increased, somnolence, rhinitis, flatulence, gastroenteritis, 
myalgia, and asthenia.  
The Phase 2 study was a randomized, sin gle-ascending  dose, double -blind,  
parallel -design, active (ivermectin) -controlled, inpatient/outpatient study conducted at a 
single center, the Onchocerciasis Chemotherapy Research Center in Ghana, an 
onchocerciasis endemic region of Africa. Of the 172 subjects in the safety population, 
170 subjects (98.8%) experienced at least one AE. In assessing the safety of 
chemotherapeutics in the treatment of onchocerciasis, a generally universal observation 
among treated patients is the Mazzotti reaction, which is a constellation of symptoms 
caused  by [CONTACT_119275]. Common 
systemic clinical manifestations of the Mazzotti reaction include pruritus, rash, 
lymphadenitis, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, hypotension (including severe symptomatic 
postural h ypotension), fever, and swelling of the face and limbs. Ocular events include 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_119230] (excessive lacrimation), photophobia, conjunctival injection, limbitis, anterior 
uveitis, chorioretinitis, and optic neuritis.  
At least 1  AE consistent with the effects of the dying microfilariae was reported for 
38 subjects (86.4%) treated with 2 -mg moxidectin, 45 subjects (100%) treated with 4 -mg 
moxidectin, 37 subjects (97.4%) treated with 8 -mg moxidectin, and 43 subjects (95.6%) 
treated with ivermectin , occurring more  commonly in moxidectin recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The events 
were not life threatening in either  moxidectin or ivermectin recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. No clinically 
relevant treatment -related non -Mazzotti AEs were observed in any of the treatment 
groups. No subject was withdrawn from th e study due to an AE. Eight subjects 
experienced SAEs in the study: 5, 1, and [ADDRESS_132989] (moxidecti n 2 mg) died on Day 310 from a snake bite. 
All moxidectin doses (except 2 mg at the 18 -month time point) resulted in statistically 
significantly lower skin microfilaria levels at all time points after treatment when 
compared with ivermectin.  
A large (n = 14 72) multicenter (multinational), double -blind, randomized 
(moxidectin  2:ivermectin 1), stratified (gender, baseline microfilarial load, site),

01 March  2017 Page 26 of 83 Version 2 .0 ivermectin -controlled Phase 3  study was conducted in subjects infected with O. volvulus : 
1472  subjects were enrol led across 4 sites and treated with either a single 8 -mg dose of 
moxidectin (n  = 978) or a single 150-µg/kg dose of ivermectin (n = 494). Subjects 
participated in a 30 -day screening period, a minimum 6 -day inpatient evaluation period  
following administrati on of study drug, and follow -up visits at Day 14 and at Months  1, 
3, 6, 12 , and (for a subset of subject s) [ADDRESS_132990] 12 months 
was completed for greater than 95% of study subjects. The study met the pre-defined 
primary endpoint  of superiority of moxidectin over ivermectin at Month 12 ( P <0.0001). 
Furthermore, treatment differences were observed early and persisted to 18  months. 
Similar efficacy was seen across the different level of infection subsets.  
All 978 subjects (100%) in the moxidectin treatment group and 491 subjects (99.4%) in 
the ivermectin treatment group experienced treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) during the 
active phase of the study (defined as the date of study drug administration and up to 
180 days after this date).  
A total of 966/978 subjects (98.8%) in the moxidectin treatment group and 
480/494  subjects (95.6%) in the ivermectin treatment group experienced  at least 1  AE 
consistent with the effects of the dying microfilariae . Reactions occurring more 
frequently in t he moxidectin treated  subjects included lymph node pain, lymphadenitis, 
tachycardia, pruritus (skin or eye), edema, rash,  urticaria,  and orthostatic hypotension ; 
this is consistent with a more extensive decrease in skin  microfilariae and faster reduction 
in skin microfilariae generally observed with moxidectin treatment  as compared with 
ivermectin treatment. A total of 205/978 subjects (21.0%) in the moxidectin treatment 
group and 79/494 subjects (16.0%) in the ivermectin treatment group experienced ocular  
TEAEs , the most common of which were eye pain, eye pruritis , and eyelid edema.  
Only 25 subjects (2.6%) in the moxidectin  treatment group and 13 subjects (2.6%) in the 
ivermectin group experienced adverse drug reactions , assessed by [CONTACT_119276].  
No AEs during the active phase of the study led to withdrawal.  
In total , 57 subjects (3.8%) experienced 77 SAEs during the active phase of the  study. In 
the moxidectin treatment group, 39/978 subjects (4.0%) experienced 52 events, and in the  
ivermectin treatment group, 18/494 subjects (3.6%) experienced [ADDRESS_132991] (moxidectin 
2 mg) died on Day 310 from a snake bite. Four subjects died during the  active phase of 
the study, 2  subjects (0.2%) in each group. In the moxidectin group , [ADDRESS_132992] died after experiencing diabetic acidotic coma 
secondary to malaria and m eningeal syndrome.  
The full and final ana lysis of the Phase 3 study data is ongoing and will be con cluded in 
the fourth quarter  of 2016.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cardiovascular Safety  
Non-clinical data supportive of the cardiovascular safety of moxidectin consists of  the 
following : 
 A lack of binding to ion channels, including calcium Type L and Type N, 
ATP -sensitive potassium, Ca -activated V1 potassium , IKr ( human ether -à-go-go 
[hERG ]) potassium and Site  2 sodium chan nels in a NovaScreen assay;  
 Minimal effect on hERG current in HEK 293 cells in vitro  at concentrations 
approximately 100 -fold higher than C max in adult patients in a Phase 2 study;  and 
 Lack of effect on corrected QT interval (QTc) monitored over 72 hours in a dog 
cardiovascular -telemetered  study at an oral dose of 1 mg/k g, approximately 16.[ADDRESS_132993] -of-care 
ivermectin, there were no SAEs  in the system organ class (SOC) of cardiac disorders. 
There was 1 SAE  of grand mal convulsion (moxidect in 2 mg), 2 non-serious AEs of 
syncope (moxidectin 2 mg and 4 mg), and 1 non-serious AE of ventricular extrasystole 
(moxidectin 2 mg). There was no evidence of QTc prolongation in these patients.  
Two patients receiving moxidectin (4 mg and 8 mg) who had a post-baseline QT interval 
corrected by [CONTACT_35019]’s formula ( QTcB ) of >450 milliseconds ( msec ) with a >10% increase 
from Baseline did not have any AEs in  the SOC  of cardiac disorders or AEs suggestive of 
delayed repolarization (Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities [MedDRA ] query 
“Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation” ). One subject in the moxidectin 8 -mg treatment 
group on Day 1 had a QTc interval >[ADDRESS_132994] in any of the treatment 
groups had a QTc interval greater than 500 msec. There was n o statistically significant 
difference ( P >0.05) between moxidectin and ivermectin treatment groups for any QTc 
interval change greater than 30  msec or 60 msec, or with values greater than 450 msec, 
480 msec , or 500 msec during the study. For further infor mation , please refer to the 
current Investigator’s Brochure.  
3.4. Study Rationale  
Even though the available non -clinical and clinical data is not suggestive of a QT 
liability, t he aim of the current study is to definitively assess the QT prolongation 
potential of moxidectin through a dedicated dose -ranging  design with intensive and 
time-matched PK and ECG collections using a concentration QT (cQT) analysis 
approach . 
The study will enroll healthy male volunteers. The rationale for including only males is 
that mox idectin plasma concentration predictions have been derived from PK data from 
the Phase  1 study (3110A1 -1005 -EU) in which only males [ADDRESS_132995] population.  
3.4.1 Rationale for Study Design  
A definitive human  QT prolongation risk -assessment study has not been pe rformed with 
moxidectin. The results of this study  will provide an understanding of the cardiac safety 
profile of moxidectin that is appr opriate for th e proposed use, a single oral 8 -mg dose.  
Given the PK characteristics of moxidectin ( i.e., long half -life), a standard [ADDRESS_132996] 
crossover thorough QT (TQT) study cannot be conducted as described in International 
Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) E14. ICH E14 suggests conduct of a 4 -arm

01 March  2017 Page 29 of 83 Version 2 .0 parallel -group study for drugs with a long half -life w here a crossover design is not 
feasible .18 
The December 2014 joint meeting between the FDA, the Clinical Pharmacology 
Leadership Group of the Consortium for Innovation and Quality in  Pharmaceutical 
Development (IQ) , and the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium (CSRC) has provided 
the impetus for using a cQT appro ach for replacing the TQT study ;19,[ADDRESS_132997] -in-human dose -rangi ng study and utilizing 
exposure -response (ER) analyses to detect QT effects. The experience with ER ana lyses 
of ECG data has increased over the last decade and ER analyses have become an integral 
part of FDA Interdisciplinary Review Team review of da ta from QT assessment studies .[ADDRESS_132998] -in-human dose -ranging study; h owever, there will be no need to stagger 
enrollment into cohorts for safety (which  has already been established).  
Subjects will be randomized into  6 treatment  groups (5:1 moxidectin:placebo) with 
10 subjects per  group. The dose range will provide for a 12 -fold dose margin (4.7 -fold 
exposure margin at C max), exceeding the 4.5 -fold range that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_119231] h the risk of a false negative .21 Triplicate ECGs will be 
assessed at Baseline and at pre-specified time points matched with PK sampling for 
3 days in all subjects (see Section 5.6.1 ). With 1 5 sampling time points, this design will 
yield 900 QTc-PK pairs  in total. After placebo and basel ine subtraction, there will be 
700 time-matched, placebo -corrected, baseline -adjusted QTc (ddQTc )-PK pairs.  In 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -[ADDRESS_132999], the Ferber design20,24 used in the IQ -CSRC study yielded 315 QTc -PK pairs and 
189 ddQTc -PK pairs per drug.  
3.4.2 Doses Selected  
The proposed human dose for the treatment of onchocerciasis is 8 mg. This study will 
assess moxidectin as a single oral dose at doses up to 36 mg in tablet  form and in the 
fasted state. In addition to the non -clinical safety pharmacology and tox icology studies, 
which provide d adequate safety margin multiples in reference to the  36-mg dose, 
moxidectin has previously been administered at doses up to 36 mg in healthy human 
subjects and was  well tolerate d. Specifically, in Study 3110A1 -100-EU, there was no 
evidence of clinically relevant safety findings after administration of moxidectin (oral 
liquid). No clinically relevant abnormalities were observed in vital sign me asurements, 
ECGs, or laboratory test results  during the study. A slightly higher incidence of CNS AEs 
(somnolence and mild dizziness) was observed in the 36 -mg fed and fasted treatment 
groups (moxidectin or placebo). As this was prior to study unblinding and the dose was 
well above the predic ted therapeutic dose, the decision was made to end the study prior to 
enrollment of a planned 54 -mg cohort. There was found to be no major difference in the 
pattern and severity of AEs and the AEs reported during the study were mild to moderate 
in intensit y with the exception of one Grad e 3 event (enteritis) in the [ADDRESS_133000] article.  There were no SAEs and no subjects discontinued 
the study due to an AE.  
Increased exposure to moxidectin has been observed in liquid prese ntations compared 
with tablets and whe n moxidectin is given with food . Of the 10 subjects who received 
moxidectin as an oral solution at 36 mg in Study 31 10A1 -100-EU, the fasted mean (± SE) 
AUC from time  0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf) was 451  (±48.2)  ng*days/mL 
compared with fed AUC 0-inf of 624 (± 41.6) ng*days/mL. Therefore, moxidectin 
administered in tablet form and in the fasted state should ensure that exposure is less than 
or equal to existing clinical experience.  
Further information on the safet y findings and PK of moxidectin are included in the

4.2. Secondary Objective  
The se condary objective  of the study is to assess the safety and PK of a single oral dose 
of moxidectin . 
4.3. Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objectives of the study are:  
 To gain preliminary information in humans on the metabolism and excretion of 
moxidectin ; 
 To evaluate the baseline -corrected changes in other EC G and cardiovascular 
parameters; and  
 To evaluate the ECG morphologic changes related to cardiac repolarization (ST 
segment and T waves).

5.4. Withdrawal of Subjects from  the Study  
A subject may withdraw from the study for any reason and at any time.  
The investigator must make every reasonable effort to keep each subject in th e study 
except where termination or withdr awal is for reasons of safety. The investigator also has 
the right to withdraw subjects from study in the event of concurrent illness, AE, protocol 
violation, administrative reaso n, or other reason.  
It is understoo d by [CONTACT_119280].  
5.4.1 Reasons for Withdrawal  
The primary reason for treatment discontinuation will be noted using the following 
categories:  
1. AE: The subject exper iences an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], requires 
early termination. If a subject is discontinued from the study due to an AE, the 
investigator  or medically qualified designee will be required to follow -up with the 
subject until the event res olves or becomes stable. If a subject death occurs during 
the study, the cause of death will be reported as a n SAE, with an outcome of death 
noted in the eCRF.  
A subject will be withdrawn from the study if he has an ECG with a manually 
measured QTcF of >5 00 msec at any time point after dosing that i s confirmed by 
[CONTACT_093] . It will be recorded as an AE and reported immediately to the 
medical monitor.

Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 36 of 83 Version 2 .0 2. Protocol deviation: The subject fails to meet protocol entry criteria or does not 
adhere to protoco l requirements, and continued participation will pose  an 
unnecessary risk to the subject’s health.  
3. Voluntary withdrawal of consent: The subject wishes to withdraw from the study in 
the absence of a medical need.  
4. Study termination: The sponsor, institutio nal review board (IRB), FDA, or other 
regulatory agency terminates the study.  
5. Other.  
Note: This category includes withdrawals caused by [CONTACT_119281] a medical 
emergency, unblinding, or other rare cases. The specific reasons will be recorded in 
the eC RF.

study if the subject meets the withdrawal criteria described in Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_133011]’s participation be discontinued, the primary reason for 
termina tion must be recorded.  
If a subject discontinues from the study or is withdrawn, the investigator w ill notify the 
sponsor and, when possible, will perform the following procedures: vital sign 
measurements; safety 12 -lead ECG ; symptom -based physical examination; collection of  
AEs; and clinical laboratory evaluation (including hematology, serum chemistry,  and 
urinalysis).

All laboratory tests on blood samples will be performed at the selected laboratory. 
Information on collection and shipment of all requ ired study samples  will be described in 
the Study Reference Manual . 
Additional visits and/or assessments may be conducted as clinically indicated. For these 
additional assessments, visit -specific data will not be collected in the eCRF, although all 
AEs and  concurrent medication s must be recorded throughout the study period.

5.6. Details of Study Procedures  
5.6.1 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Continuous [ADDRESS_133014] with scheduled 
study procedures ( i.e., showers will not be permitted on  Day 1 due to the frequency of 
scheduled study procedures on that particular day). The ECG data will be transmitted 
wirelessly to the Surveyor system, which will extract triplicate 10 -second ECG 
recordings (approximately 1  minute apart) at the following ti me points : 
 Baseline (before dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 , and 72 hours 
after dosing  
A window of ±5  minutes around each time point will be utilized to capture ECGs of 
adequate quality , although every effort should be made to c apture them as close to the 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 44 of 83 Version 2 .0 scheduled time points as possible . The ECG extraction s will be time -matched to the PK 
samples but obtained before the actual sampling time to avoid changes in autonomic tone 
associated with the psychological aspects of blood col lection as well as the reduction in 
blood volume subsequent to blood collection . 
Subjects will refrain from talking and will be required to be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a quiet 
room with no external stimuli ( e.g., music or television) for approximately 10 mi nutes 
before and 5 minutes after the defined ECG collection time points.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Continuous [ADDRESS_133015] confinement . 
Digital ECGs will b e transmitted to the central ECG laboratory’s validated data 
management system. If targeted ECG time points are artifactual and of poor quality, the 
central ECG labora tory will extract analyzable [ADDRESS_133016] appropriate lead ( e.g., lead V2) will be used.  
5.6.2 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blood Sa mples  
Blood samples will be collected to determine the PK of moxidectin  and metabolites  in 
plasma . Plasma aliquots will be stored  frozen at the CRU before being shipped to a 
specialized laboratory for analysis.  Blood samples  will be collected for PK assess ments at 
Baseline  (0 hour; within 15 minutes before dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4*, 5, 6, 8, 12*, 
24*, 36*, 48, 60*, and 72  hours after dosing, and on Days  8, 15, and 2 2. 
* Planned time points for analysis of moxidectin metabolite concentrations

01 March  2017 Page 45 of 83 Version 2 .0 Blood sampling time points will coincide with the ECG time points. The blood samples 
will be collected as close to the scheduled time point as possible , within 5  minutes and no 
later than 10  minutes after the ECG , unless otherwise noted . 
Sample c ollection, processi ng, and storage will be described in the Study Reference 
Manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urine and Fec es Samples  
Urine and feces for PK assessments will be collected from each subject at the following 
time points : 
 Urine: Before dosing (single pre-dose collection ; first void sampl e in the morning is 
acceptable and volume recording is not required ) and  for pooled intervals of 0 to 24, 
24 to 48, and 48 to 72  hours after dosing (4  samples)  
 Feces: Before dosing (single pre -dose collection*) and each bowel motion during 
confinement in t he CRU. Samples will be pooled at the central laboratory for 
intervals of 0 to 24, 24 to 48, and 48  to 72 hours after dosing (up to 4  samples)  
* Feces specimens (the whole bowel movement) may be collected by [CONTACT_1766] (at 
home) within 2 days of submitting t hem to study staff on Day –1. Collection 
instructions will be provided at Screening.  
At Screening, s ubjects will be provided with materials to collect feces  so that when the 
subject has a bowel movement on or before Day –1 (-2 days) , this can be collected if it 
occurs before admission  to the CRU  (or up to and including 0.5  hours before dosing as 
necessary to obtain a collection before dosing) . A sample may be collected at the CRU on 
Day –1. Subjects will be instructed to refrigerate any feces specimen colle cted before 
admission to the CRU . 
The weight of each feces specimen will be measured (grams) and recorded  to the whole 
number . Urine volumes will be pooled over each interval and the total volume obtained; a 
single sample from the total volume will be obta ined for PK assessments . 
Urine and fec es samples will be stored frozen at the CRU before being shipped  to a 
specialized laboratory for analysis.  Sample c ollection, processing , and storage will be 
described in the Study Reference Manual.

01 March  2017 Page 46 of 83 Version 2 .0 5.6.3 Safety Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
An AE is defined (per ICH E2A) as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject that is administered a pharmaceutical product that does not  
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE co uld therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease that is temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not the incident is considered related to the m edicinal (investigational) 
product.  
Adverse event monitoring will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form 
(ICF) and will continue until  Week  12. Before  dosing of the study drug, AEs will be 
assessed for the ir relationship to study procedur e(s) by [CONTACT_093] . 
At each study visit, the investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have 
occur red. A neutral question such as, “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” 
will be asked. Subjects may report AEs that occur at any ot her time during the study.

All laboratory values must be reviewed in real time by [CONTACT_093].  Given that all 
laboratory data are co llected and statistically analyz ed according to th eir respective 
toxicity grades , laboratory abnormalities that occur without related clinical symptoms and 
signs should generally not be recorded as an AE unless they represent a  clinically 
significant event.  Where possible, the overall diagnosis rather than t he laboratory 
abnormality should be recorded in the AE eCRF.  This will avoid duplication of 
laboratory abnormalities in both the AE and laboratory reports.  Abnormal laboratory 
results that are of clinical significance will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] m edical monito r. 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -[ADDRESS_133017] result that meets the criteria for a n SAE (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ) 
should be recorded as an AE, the AE page of the eCRF completed , and a n SAE form also 
completed in order for the sponsor to collect ad ditional information about that 
abnormality, including information regarding relationship to study product or other 
causes, any action taken , and resolution.  
Each AE will be assessed for causality using the following criteria:  
 Definitely related: The expe rience follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug or in which the drug level has been established in 
body fluids or tissues; the experience follows a known response pattern to the 
suspected drug and this is confirmed by [CONTACT_119284][INVESTIGATOR_1478] 
(dechallenge) and reappearance of the reaction upon repeated exposure (rechallenge).  
 Probably related: The experience follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug; the experience follows a k nown response pattern to 
the suspected drug and this is confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]; the experience could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state.  
 Possibly related: The experience follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from 
administration of the study drug; the experience follows a known response pattern to 
the suspected drug; the experience could be produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
 Not related: Th e experience occurs before administration of the study drug; the 
experience follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug but does not follow a known response pattern to the suspected drug and could be 
reasonably explained by  [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state; the 
experience is proven to be caused by [CONTACT_423]’s disease or condition or another 
drug through rechallenge; the experience does not recur following rechallenge.  
All subjects experiencing AEs , whether considered associated with the use of the study 
drug or not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant 
changes in laboratory values have returned to Baseline or until there is a satisfactory 
explanation for the chan ges observed.   
All AEs are documented in the eCRF, whether or not the investigator concludes the event 
to be related to the study drug. The event term, start and stop date, and severity are 
documented, along with the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_119240] r elationship between the 
event and study drug administration (not related, pos sible, probable, or definite).  
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 49 of 83 Version 2 .0 All AEs will be followed until resolution or until the investigator determines that further 
follow -up is not necessary. The type of follow -up (telep hone call or CRU  visit) will be 
based on medical judgment and the severity of the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an AE that results in any of the following:  
 Death  
 Is life threatening ( i.e., the subject was at risk of death from the event. “Life 
threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was 
at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused  death if it were more severe)  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119241]: Emergency department visits are n ot considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  
 Persistent or significant disa bility/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
An AE may be considered serious ( i.e., an important m edical event) if based on medical 
and scientific judgment, the event may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in t he definition above.  
If an SAE occurs, appropriate therapy will be administered  based on the investigator’s 
judgment . Subjects will then be monitored closely as appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Additional Points to Consider for Adverse Events  
Diagnoses versus signs and sympto ms:  
 Each AE will be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms will NOT be 
recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) will be 
recorded a s an AE(s).  
Laboratory values and ECG findings:  
 Changes in laboratory values or ECG parameters are only considered to be AEs if 
they are judged to be clinically significant ( i.e., if some action or intervention is 
required or if the investigator judges t he change to be beyond the range of normal 
physiological fluctuation).  
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 50 of 83 Version 2 .0  If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which 
there is an overall diagnosis ( e.g., increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis 
only will be reported as an AE.  
Pre-existing conditions:  
 Pre-existing conditions (present before the start of the AE collection period) are 
considered concurrent medical conditions and will NOT be recorded as AEs. 
However, if the subject experiences a worsening (severity or frequency) or 
complication of such a concurrent condition, the worsening or complication will be 
recorded as an AE. The investigator  will ensure that the AE term recorded captures 
the change in the condition ( e.g., “worsening of…”).  
Pre-planne d surgeries or procedures:  
 Procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were planned  before  the start of AE collection 
are not considered AEs. However, if a pre-planned procedure is performed early 
(e.g., as an emergency) due t o a worsening of the pre -existin g condition, the 
worsening of the condition will be captured as an AE.  
Elective surgeries or procedures:  
 Elective procedures planned or performed where there is no change in the subject’s 
medical condition will not be recorded as AEs, but will be documen ted in the 
subject’s source documents.  
Overdose:  
 Cases of study drug overdose without manifested side effects are NOT considered 
AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Reports of SAEs require immediate reporting to the sponsor and the medical monitor, 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event, whether or not the 
investigator believes that the experience is related to study drug.  
An SAE form must be completed, signed by [CONTACT_093], and include at a minimum: 
the event term(s), a short description of the AE, the reason why the AE is categorized as 
serious, the investigator’s current opi[INVESTIGATOR_119242] (causality assessment), as well as the subject’s identification number, gender, 
age, a nd relevant medical history.  
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 51 of 83 Version 2 .0 Additional information, as appropriate, will be sent to the sponsor and medical monitor 
when it becomes available ( e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_119243], autopsy reports, and 
other documents).  
Reporting of a suspected SAE will not be delayed in order to obtain additional 
information.  
Any additional information, if collected, can be reported as a follow -up to the initial 
report.  
For each SAE, a corresponding AE eCRF  must also be completed.  
The investigator is responsible f or notifying the IRB in writing of any SAE. All SAEs are 
to be documented in the eCRF with the date of onset and resolution, frequency, 
determination of seriousness, severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to study 
drug.  
Any SAE, including death,  occurring while the subject is receiving study drug , 
irrespective of the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_119244], will be 
reported by [CONTACT_119285]:  
Name: [CONTACT_119310] e: [PHONE_2722] or [PHONE_2723]  
Email: SAE @medicinesdevelopment .com  
Any SAEs that occur within [ADDRESS_133018] dose of study drug that come to the 
attention of the investigator, and are thought to be related to study drug, will be reported 
to the sponsor and the medical monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_133019]’s condition has 
stabilized.  
All follow -up information on SAEs is to be reported within [ADDRESS_133020] be reported to the FDA in writing within 15 calendar days of notification of  
Medicines Development for Gl obal Health (MDGH) . Serious AEs that meet the criterion 
for death or are immediately life threatening require  MDGH  to notify the FDA by 
[CONTACT_756], fax, or in writing as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_133021] knowledge that the c ase qualifies, followed up by a complete report within 
8 additional calendar days.  
MDGH  or delegate will prepare an expedited report for the FDA based on information 
provided by [CONTACT_119286], and copi[INVESTIGATOR_119245].  
Expedited repor ts, as addenda to the Investigator’s Brochure, will be filed with the 
Investigator’s Brochure  by [CONTACT_119287]. The investigator also will 
forward a copy of all expedited reports to the IRB  as required . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_133022]’s cause of death and a copy of the autopsy report, if any , 
will also be provided.  MDGH  must be notified immediately by [CONTACT_119288]; written follow -up must be received within [ADDRESS_133023]’s death will be marked with an outcome of “Fatal.”

Screening. At all subsequent time points, a  symptom -based  physical examination 
(informed by [CONTACT_119269], signs and symptoms , and AEs reported)  will be 
performed . The screening physical examination will consist of the following body 
systems: eyes,  ears, nose, and throat; card iovascular system; respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]; 
gastrointestinal system; dermatological system; extremities; musculoskeletal system; 
nervous system; and lymph nodes.  
The subject’s weight (kg) and height ( centimeters [ cm]) will be measured using a

01 March  2017 Page 60 of 83 Version 2 .0 5.8. Statistical Analysis Plan  
Details of all planned statistical analyses will be described in a separate statistical 
analysis p lan. 
For purposes of statistical analysi s, this study is divided into 2 study periods:  
 Period 1: Commences at Screening and will finish on Day [ADDRESS_133037] has completed the study 
through Period  1, the blind will be broken and the data from Period  1 will be 
analyzed.  
 Period 2: Period  [ADDRESS_133038] data listings. This will include those measurements from excluded 
subjects, or measurements from unscheduled collections, or extra measurements that may 
arise from 2 or more analyses of the plasma sample from the same time point.  
For categorical va riables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, arithmetic 
mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  
Demographic and background characteristics will be summari zed overall for all subjects. 
The number of subjects who enroll in the study and the number and percentage of 
subjects who discontinue and reasons for discontinuation will be presented.  
5.8.1 Pharmacodynamic  Endpoint s 
The PD endpoints are calculated from the mea n of the triplicate continuous 12 -lead ECG 
data as:  
1. dQTcF –baseline -adjusted QTcF;  
2. ddQTcF – time-match ed, placebo -corrected, baseline -adjusted QTcF, which is 
calculated as the dQTcF minus the time -matched mean dQTcF of all placebo 
subjects at each po st-dose time point (ddQTcF  = [dQTcF  (active dose groups)  – 
mean dQTcF  (placebo)]);  
The primary study endpoint is the dQTcF matched to the plasma concentration of 
moxidectin collected at the same time point.  
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 61 of 83 Version 2 .0 Analogous derived exploratory endpoints are als o calculated for HR  and duration of PR, 
RR, and QRS interval parameters.  
The ECG morphologic changes data are also considered an exploratory endpoint.  
5.8.2 Safety and Tolerability  Endpoint s 
The safety endpoints are:  
1. Monitoring and reporting of AEs;  
2. Vital si gn measurements;  
3. Clinical laboratory test results (hematology, serum chemist ry, and urinalysis);  
4. Safety 12-lead ECG results;  
5. Physical examination findings.  
Secondary study endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measure ment s, safety 12 -lead ECG results, and physical examination findings.  
5.8.3 Sample Size Calculation  
The sample size of 60 subjects (10 subjects each in 6 treatment groups) is considered 
adequate to explore the effects of moxidectin on the QTc interval, as this d esign will 
yield [ADDRESS_133039] completed dosing. Subjects who withdraw after dosing will not be replaced . 
5.8.4 Analysis Populations  
For this study, 4  study populations will be defined :  
 The ECG population will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_133040] 1 time 
point. Subjects in this population  will be used for all digital ECG summaries and 
analyses. Subjects in this population will be analyzed as randomized.  
 The PK population  will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of moxidectin 
and provide an adequate number of blood samples for the determination of plasma 
PK parameters. Subjects in this population will be used for all PK summaries. 
Subjects in this population w ill be analyzed according to the drug received (actual 
drug concentration).

5.9. Statistical Analyses  
5.9.1 Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
All continuous 12 -lead ECG data collected will be presented in data listings. Data from 
subjects excluded from the analysis populations will be presen ted in the data listings, but 
not included in the calculation of summary statistics. For categorical variables, 
frequencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous variables will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, 2 -sided confid ence bounds [90% for the QTcF 
interval or 95% for other parameters], median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, minimum, 
and maximum). The mean of the triplicate 0 -hour time point on Day 1 will be used as the 
baseline. The continuous 12 -lead ECG parameters (QTcF, HR, PR, RR, and QRS) and 
the corresponding changes from Baseline (denoted as dQTcF, dHR, dPR, dRR, and 
dQRS) and placebo -adjusted endpoints (denoted as ddQTcF, ddHR, ddPR, ddRR, and 
ddQRS) will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268].  
The means an d 90%  confidence intervals  (CIs) for the dQTcF and placebo -adjusted 
(algebraic) ddQTcF will be calculated across all subjects for each time point and each 
active treatment and displayed graphically. Secondary endpoints will also be displayed 
using 95% CI, if applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Analysis of the Primary Pharmacodynamic Endpoint  
The relationship between time -matched dQTcF and moxidectin concentrations will be 
investigated by [CONTACT_119267] -effects modeling. The ddQTcF value will be calculated as 
the placebo -corrected dQTcF estimated from the model.  
Before modeling, the concentration -ddQTcF relationship will be explored graphically to 
determine the presence of hysteresis. Hysteresis will be assumed if, on average (or 
median), there are at least 3 time points with ddQTcF >5 msec and the time to maximum 
observed plasma concentration (T max) and the time of maximal ddQTcF (U max) differ by 
[ADDRESS_133042] for the difference between 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 63 of 83 Version 2 .0 ddQTcF at T max and at U max is significant at t he 1% level. If hysteresis is present, the 
possibility of fitting a population PK model with an effect compartment will be explored.  
The primary analysis will be provided for the ECG  population using a mixed -effects 
model with dQTcF as the dependent variab le and treatment (active and placebo), time 
point, and treatment by [CONTACT_119293] a covariate and time -matched concentrations of moxidectin (observed if 
hysteresis is not present; predicted from t he effect compartment if hysteresis is present) 
as a covariate with random effects of intercept and slope. Concentrations of zero will be 
used for the placebo treatment. A spatial power law covariance structure (a 
time-dependent first -order autoregressive covariance designed for unequally -spaced time 
points) will be used. If the model does not converge, then unstructured (UN) or 
compound symmetry (CS) structures will be assessed, in that order. The model will be 
used for predicting population average and 90 % 2-sided bootstrapped CI of the 
baseline -adjusted difference (i .e., ddQTcF) between active and placebo at each time point 
bound at clinically relevant concentrations. The bootstrap method will be based on 
percentile CI using the 5th and 95th percentiles i n the res ampling distribution using 
1000  iterations.  
The criterion for negative QT assessment will be the upper bound of the 2 -sided 90% 
bootstrapped CI for ddQTcF being below [ADDRESS_133043] geometric mean C max 
value. In addition, the significance and magnitude of parameter estimates of the treatment 
covariate (active v ersus  placebo) will be considered.  
At the request of the FDA , the primary endpoint in the study has been updated to dQTcF 
and this is the dependent variable in the primary analysis, w hich includes plasma 
concentrations as covariates with random slope and intercept as well as treatment and 
time point as categorical independent variables. However, in addition to obtaining the 
plasma concentration intercept and slope estimates, the estima ted dQTcF values from the 
primary analysis will be compared by [CONTACT_119294], resulting in estimates of ddQTcF, which 
will be presented. In addition, a secondary analysis  with ddQTcF as the dependent 
variable will be performed, as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_119250], to assess correlation and 
overall profile of ddQTc F and plasma concentrations. The sponsor  believe s it is 
important to do these analyses in addition to the primary  analysis, because the dQTcF 
analysis could yield a spuriously positive or negative regression slope based on the 
relationship between the well -known spontaneous circadian change in dQTcF and the 
concentration -time profile of the investigational drug. For example, if the early to midday 
circadian increase in dQTcF concurred with a rise in plasma concentration of moxidectin, 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -1008   Confidential  
 
01 March  2017 Page 64 of 83 Version 2 .0 this could create the appearance of a positive relationship that might exceed the upper 
confidence boundary of 10 ms ec within the drug’ s clinically expected concentration 
range. Converse timing between circadian change and plasma concentration change could 
produce the opposite effect. In the ddQTcF analysis, the placebo group’s circadian 
change largely eliminates this type of spurious obs ervation. Thus, in addition to 
examining the dQTcF model, if the primary analysis produces a significantly positive or 
negative regression slope, the relationship between the investigational drug’s plasma 
concentration -time course in relationship to the ci rcadian change of dQTcF in the placebo 
group  will also be examined , to determine if a positive or negative correlatio n could have 
affected the dQTcF -plasma concentration relationship.  
Model assumptions will be reviewed with plots of standardized residuals versus fitted 
values and normal Q -Q plots of the standardized residuals. If nonlinearity is present, a log 
linear and/or maximum effect (E max) or other model will be considered.  
Similar analyses will be repeated for HR, PR, and QRS, however, bootstrap perc entiles 
will be based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, corresponding to a 2 -sided 95% CI 
rather than the 2 -sided 90% CI.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Analysis: Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic 
Analyses  
To evaluate the relationship between placebo -corrected mean change fro m Baseline in 
QTcF (i.e., ddQTcF) versus plasma concentrations of moxidectin for all subjects in the 
PK/PD population, both graphical and mixed -effects analyses of plasma concentration of 
ddQTcF versus plasma concentration of moxidectin will be performed. The mixed -effects 
model will be used to account for the clustering effects within each subject at different 
time points. The mixed -effects model will contain ddQTcF as the dependent variable and 
include the corresponding time -matched plasma moxidectin conc entrations as the 
independent variable. The mixed -effects model will be used to estimate, for all subjects, 
the predicted population mean ddQTcF and its corresponding upper 95% 1 -sided 
(equivalent to the upper 90% 2 -sided) CI over a range of observed plasm a concentrations. 
A negative result (i.e., the model indicates no plasma concentration effect) is a slope of 
approximately zero.  
The adequacy of the linear assumption between ddQTcF and plasma concentrations will 
be determined by [CONTACT_1583] a quadratic term to  the mixed -effects model. If the quadratic 
term is different than zero, having P<0.05, and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is 
smaller in comparison with the linear model’s AIC, then a quadratic term may be added. 
In addition, a transformation of the c oncentrations (e.g., log[C/LLOQ], where LLOQ is

with the LLOQ) may also be assessed. The best model fit will be determined by [CONTACT_119295].  
The predicted mean expecte d ddQTcF and the 90% [ADDRESS_133044] models, for all subjects, at relevant 
concentration levels (i.e., the mean maximum plasma concentration under each dose 
level).  
A plot of the observe d median -decile drug concentrations and associated mean ddQTcF 
(90% CI) together with the mean model -predicted ddQTcF will be used to evaluate the 
adequacy of the model fit to the assumption of linearity and the impact on quantifying the 
concentration resp onse relationship . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Categorical QTc Findings  
Categorical summaries using the largest postdose QTcF and larg est dQTcF  will be 
performed to determine the number and percentage of subjects, by [CONTACT_3148], who meet 
each of the following criteria:  
 Result ≤450 mse c; 
 Result >450 and ≤480 msec;  
 Result >480 and ≤500 msec;  
 Result >500 msec;  
 dQTcF ≤30 msec;  
 dQTcF >30 and ≤60 msec;  
 dQTcF >60 msec.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Categorical Analysis of Other Electrocardiogram  Intervals  
Categorical summaries of outliers will be provided for other ECG va riables (PR, QRS, 
and HR) as follows:  
 PR outliers postdose (PR >200 msec and a 25% or greater increase from Baseline);  
 QRS outliers postdose (QRS >100 msec and a 25% or greater increase from 
Baseline);  
 HR outliers postdose (HR <50 beats/minute and a 25% or  greater decrease from 
Baseline);

[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogram  Diagnostic Statement Analysi s 
Abnormal diagnostic statements will be tallied and tabulated for each treatment and time 
point. The variety of diagnostic statements with the same meaning will be aggregated into 
defined categories. For exampl e, T wave inversion and lead V2 and T wave flattening in 
lead II will both be categorized as nonspecific T wave abnormality. The incidence rate of 
diagnostic statements will be tabulated for both pre -dose and post -dose assessments, and 
also tabulated with diagnostic stat ements categorized as treatment -emergent diagnostic 
statements (i .e., diagnostic statements not present on any baseline assessment). All 
abnormal ECG diagnostic findings will be listed . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adequacy of Heart Rate Correction  
The adequacy of the c orrection formula will be assessed by [CONTACT_119296]. Adequacy is defined as a population QTcF:RR slope of 
<|0.045|, and a slope of <|0.045| in at least 50% of individual subjects.  
The QT interval with individual correcti on (QTcI) is mentioned in the ICH E14 Guidance 
as an ancillary correction method.  
The QTcI, if needed, will be calculated for each subject, using all available QT/RR 
pre-dose pairs by [CONTACT_119297]’s QT:RR relationship using 
all available pre -dose data. Then QTcI will be calculated from each subject’s individual 
ECG time point QT and RR interval values with the formula: QTcI = QT + slope (1000 – 
RR).

the o verall safety pattern will be monitored closely and the study may be discontinued for 
valid scientific or administrative reasons.  
Only 1 set of datasets, tables, listings, and gr aphs are outlined in this SAP. T he intent is 
to summarize all available data a fter Period 1, and then, rather than producin g 2 sets of 
datasets and tables  (1 for each period),  the datasets a nd tables will be re produced with the 
additio nal data added from Period [ADDRESS_133049] the existin g datasets and TLFs from 
Period  1. 
5.10. Data Quality Assurance  
The sponsor or designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities 
of this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of 
the study data presented to the sponsor lies with the principal in vestigator generating the 
data.  Before subjects are enrolled, the sponsor or designee will explain the protocol, 
Investigator’s Brochure , and eCRFs to the investigator. In addition, the clinical monitor 
will be available to explain applicable regulations a nd to answer any questions regarding 
the conduct of the study.  
At its discretion, the sponsor may conduct audits as part of the implementation of quality 
assurance to ensure that the study is being conducted in compliance with the ICH 
harmonised tripartite  guideline E6(R1): Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the protocol, 
standard operating procedures (SOPs), and all applicable regulatory requirements. Audits 
will be independent of, and separate from, the routine monitoring and quality control 
functions. The CRU  may also be compelled to undergo an inspection by a regulatory 
authority.

01 March  2017 Page 70 of 83 Version 2 .0 6. Investigator’s Obligations  
The following administrative items are meant to guide the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_119251]-investigator in the conduct of the study but may be subject to cha nge based on 
industry and government SOPs , working practice documents , or guidelines. Changes will 
be reported to the IRB but will not necessarily result in protocol amendments.  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s) , and 
regulatory inspection(s) with direct access to all of the required source documents and 
associated records. Source documents and records must be preserved for at least [ADDRESS_133050]’s right to 
protection against invasion of privac y. Throughout this study, a subject’s source data will 
only be linked to the sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a unique 
identification ( ID) number. As permitted by [CONTACT_1763], limited 
subject attributes such as  sex, age or date of birth, and subject initials may be used to 
verify the subject and accuracy of the subject’s unique ID number.  
To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the 
sponsor requires that the investigator  permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, 
representatives from any regulatory authority ( e.g., FDA), the sponsor’s designated 
auditors, and the appropriate IRB to review the subject’s original medical records (source 
data or documents), including, but not  limited to, clinical laboratory test result reports, 
ECG reports, admission and discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119252] a subject’s study participation, and autopsy reports. Access to a subject’s original 
medical records requires the specific authorization by [CONTACT_119300] (Section 6.3). 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_119253] (i.e., subject name, address, and other 
identifier fields not collected in the subject’s eCRF).  
All information  concerning the study treatment, MDGH , and its operations, such as 
patent applications, formulae, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data , and material 
not previously published are considered confidential and shall remain the sole property of 
the sponsor. The investigator agrees to use this information only in accomplishing the

to the sponsor or designee.  
6.3. Subject Consent  
Written consent documents will embody the elements of informed consent as desc ribed in 
the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF will describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal health i nformation for 
purposes of conducting the study. The ICF will explain the nature of the study, its 
objectives, and potential risks and benefits, and documents the date that informed consent 
is given. The ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he is free 
Medicines Development for Global  Health   Moxidectin  
Protocol No. MDGH -MOX -[ADDRESS_133052]’s legally acceptable 
representative may provide such consent  for the subject in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations.  
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample 
opportunity to: 1) inquire about details of the study, and 2) decide whether or not to 
participate in the study. If the subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative, 
determines that he will participate in the study, then the ICF must be signed and dated by 
[CONTACT_423], or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, at the time of consent an d 
before the subject enters into the study. The subject will be instructed to sign using his 
legal name, using blue or black ballpoint ink. The investigator must also sign and date the 
ICF at the time of consent and before the subject enters into the study . 
Once signed, the original ICF will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The investigator 
must document the date that the subject signs the ICF in the subject’s medical or unit 
record. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject.  
All revis ed ICFs must be reviewed and signed in the same manner as the original ICF. 
The date that the revised consent was obtained will be recorded in the subject’s medical 
or unit record and the subject will receive a copy of the revised ICF.

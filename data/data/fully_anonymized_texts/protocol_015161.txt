1. Introduction and Purpose:  
Nasotracheal intubation is used to facilitate  oropharyngeal surgery  in many patients , however,  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_351334] a common complication  (1). Several methods to reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_351335] a dults and children. The use of a red -rubber catheter is effective in 
guiding nasotracheal intubation in children, however it has not been studied in adults in a 
prospective, randomized, controlled trial. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness  of 
using a red -rubber catheter versus  standard, direct insertion  of a thermosoftened, lubricated  nasal 
endotracheal tube into the naris to facilitate nasotracheal intubation in adults undergoing ENT, 
plastics or OMFS surgery. This study will assess if the red -rubber catheter method leads to lower 
incidence and severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and faster time to intubation compared to the current standard 
of care.  
 
Hypothesis 1  – The red -rubber catheter group will have si gnificantly lower incidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_351336].  
 
Primary objective: To compare the incidence  of bleeding after nasotracheal intubation .  
 
Hypothesis 2 – The red -rubber catheter group will have significantly lower severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_351336].  
 
Secondary objective 1: To compare the severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_351337].  
 
Hypothesis 3 – The red -rubber catheter group will have significantly fewer airway complications 
compared to the standard insertion  group in patients undergoing nasotracheal intubation.  
 
Secondary objective 2:  To compare the rate of complications during nasotracheal intubation.  
 
Hypothesis 4 – The red -rubber catheter group will have significantly lower time to intubation than 
the standard insertion  group.  
 
Secondary objective 3:  To compare the time to intubation during nasotracheal intubation.

2. Background  
 
Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is commonly utilized in oropharyngeal surgeries to provide better 
access to the surgical field than traditional endotracheal intubation (1). NTI is also commonly used 
in patients with degenerative cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_351338], intraoral mass lesions or structural  
abnormalities, and limited mouth opening (2). NTI is generally contraindicated in cases of 
suspected epi[INVESTIGATOR_351339], midface instability, basilar sk ull fractures, and coagulopathy. M inor 
contraindications include nasal polyps, foreign bodies, recent nasal o r facial surgery, and history 
of frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (1). Some complications of NTI that have been described in the literature 
include epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], damage to a nasal turbinate or the cribriform plate, retropharyngeal dissection, 
and even intracranial placemen t of the nasotracheal tube (3 -6). One of the most common 
complications of NTI is epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], with a reported incidence of up to 86% (7).  
 
In adults, NTI is typi[INVESTIGATOR_351340] a 
vasoconstrictor, and an adequate ly lubricated  and often, thermosoftened, nasotracheal tube 
(NETT) . The NETT is held perpendicular to the face and inserted below the inferior turbinate with 
the bevel of the tube facing away from the turbinate. When the tip of the tube is seen in the 
oropharynx, direct laryngoscopy is used to visualize the cords and pas s the tube into the trachea. 
Magill forceps are often used to facilitate thi s final step (8).  
 
Several studies have evaluated ways to improve the way NTI is performed and minimize epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. 
Enk et al . utilized a Wendl tube attached to the end of the NETT to guide intubation, with removal 
of the Wendl tube once the NETT was in the oropharynx. They found that using the Wendl tube 
as a “pathfinder” significantly reduced the incidence and severity of bleed ing and decreased 
postoperative pain, although this method took longer to perform  compared to insertion of the 
NETT without a pathfinder  (9). Lim et a l. used a nasogastric tu be as a guide to facilitate NTI  and 
found that with the nasogastric tube -guided method the NETT more often passed under the inferior 
turbinate, was associated with lower incidence and severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and required fewer 
manipulations to place (10). Seo et al . obturated the ETT with an inflated esophageal stethoscope 
and thermosoftened the NETT, finding that the severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_351341] (7). A recent study by [CONTACT_351387] a flexible bougie to guide NTI, with the bougie -guided technique having 
significantly less bleeding than the conventional method but taking longer to perform (11). 
Another study had similar findings  and additionally noted that there was no difference in the first 
attempt and overall success rates of NTI with the bougie -guided or conventional method (12).   
 
In children, NTI is commonly performed using a red -rubber catheter (RRC) as a guide , and its 
efficacy has been studied in randomized controlled trials. Watt et al . compared room temperature 
and warmed NETT to the RRC method in children undergoing dental surgery and found that the 
RRC method had lower incidence of higher severity  bleeding. Although they found that the RRC 
method took longer, hemoglobin oxygen desaturation did not occur  in the time to intubation . They

Version 4, 02/04/2022 
 go on to discuss the mechanism by [CONTACT_351388][INVESTIGATOR_3940], mainly by 
[CONTACT_351389] (13). An earlier study by 
[CONTACT_351390] . comparing the RRC method to the thermosoftened nasotracheal tube alone reported 
similar results, with the RRC group having significantly less obvious bleeding. While the RRC 
method took longer to perform, it also took fewer attempts for successful placeme nt (14). A recent 
literature review by [CONTACT_351391] . on technique s for NTI in children and adults examined 15 articles, 
4 of which studied the RRC method specifically. They determined that overall this technique is 
associated with decreased trauma to the nasopharynx, bleeding, and postoperative pain (15).  
 
To date, there have been no randomized controlled trials that have evaluated the efficacy of using 
a RRC to guide NTI in adults, although there is data to support the use of the RRC method in 
children. In addition, in these trials the control was the direct insertion of a nasotracheal tube into 
the naris,  which is a common practice in adult patients. We hypothesize that RRC -guide d NTI will 
be associated with significant lower  incidence and severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_351342] . We also hypothesize that compared to the standard  
technique, the RRC method will take significantly less time to perform , will be associated with 
less postoperative pain, and will have fewer associated complications . 
 
3. Concise Summary of Project:  
The study population for this prospective randomized controlled trial will consist of male and 
female adult subjects over the age of [ADDRESS_436815] ASA monitors (BP cuff, EKG, pulse oximetry). One spray of oxymetazoline per nostril 
will again be administered. Standard preoxygenation will be used with a face mask and 100% O2. 
After induction of anesthesia , provider wil l confirm mask ventilation and [ADDRESS_436816] be attempted via a  naris (13). 
Size 6.5 nasotracheal RAE tubes  (Shiley Nasal RAE T racheal T ube with TaperGuard Cuff, 
manufactured by [CONTACT_351392], Mansfield, MA [ZIP_CODE])  will be used in female patients and size 7.5 
in males  (16). The tubes will be  thermosoftened  by [CONTACT_351393] (18). Water -based lubrication will be used for dilation and intubatio n. Time from insertion of 
RRC or NETT  into nasal passage to first recording of end -tidal CO2 will be recorded. Direct video 
laryngoscopy will be used to facilitate placement of the nasotracheal RAE tube. Five minutes a fter 
intubation, a non -collaborating anesthesia provider blinded to the method of intubation will grade 
the severity of bleeding by [CONTACT_351394] , inspecting the posterior pharynx  
and using a scale described originally by [CONTACT_351395] (19) and again  by [CONTACT_351396]. al (20)- no 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (no blood observed on either the surface of the tube or the posterior pharyngeal wall); 
mild epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (blood apparent on the surface of the tube or posterior pharyngeal wall); moderate 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (pooling of blood on the posterior pharyngeal w all); and severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (a large amount 
of blood in the pharynx impeding nasotracheal intubation —before the epi[INVESTIGATOR_351343] s the

R. Bard, Inc, Covington, GA [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003] ) will be securely attach ed to a room -temperature  
nasotracheal tube.  A 20 Fr RRC will be used with the size 7.5 nasotracheal RAE tube and an 18 
Fr RRC will be used with the size 6.5 nasotracheal RAE tube. The tubes will be warmed in saline 
prior to use  (18). Water -based lubrication will be applied to the RRC . The rounded end of the 
catheter will be introduced into a  naris  and advanced to the posterior oropharynx and visualized 
with a laryngoscope. The catheter will then be removed from the end of the nasotracheal tube and 
withdrawn through the mouth. The nasotracheal tube will then be guided into the trachea past the 
vocal cords under direct visualization  with CMAC video laryngoscope  MAC  3 or 4  blade with or 
without the assistance of Magill  forceps as determined by [CONTACT_13917] (17 ).

9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:  
 
Subjects will be identified for potential eligibility by [CONTACT_351399]. Eligible subjects will be patients of the PI, co -investigators or other 
anesthesiologists. Other anesthesiologist s will be contact[CONTACT_351400] 1 day prior to the 
scheduled surgery for their permission to enroll the subjects. A ``Dear [CONTACT_344952]’’ will be sent 
to physician s via email. Without the confirmation of their consent, investigators will not enroll the 
subjects.  
 
A desig nated team of study personnel  will be responsible for screening, consenting a nd enrolling 
potential subjects. Consenting and enrollment will take place in the preoperative holding area.  
Information about the study will be given in a pressure -free, confidential private area in a face -to-
face meeting and the voluntary nature of the research will be emphasized to the subjects.  
 
The purpose of the study will be explained to the subject. Potential risks and complications will be 
reviewed. Adequate time will be given for the subject to  consider whether to  participate in the 
STU2018 -0190, Mercier, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_15, 02 -14-22.docx    
Page 7 of 10 
Version 4, 02/04/[ADDRESS_436820]  in Spanish.  Subjects will receive a copy of the signed documents.  
 
10. Potential Risks:  
 
This study has minimal risk.  The anesthetic management in each group will not differ from the 
current standard of care.  
 
Risk for RRC: There may be risk for mucosal injury and bleeding with RRC -guided NTI. This 
risk is not  anticipated to be  higher than for standard NTI  in adults .  
 
Psychological Stress:  Some of the questions related to the study may make the subject feel 
uncomfortable.  Subjects may refuse to answer an y of the questions, t ake a break , or stop 
participation in the study at any time.  
 
Loss of Confidentiality:  Any time information is collected; there is a potential risk of loss of 
confidentiality.  Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential.  
 
11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring:  
 
Investigators will ensure patient safety throughout the procedure. This will include following all 
standards of care with regard to con ducting a safe anesthetic and intubation in the operating room .  
All standard ASA m onitors will be used and proper interventions by [CONTACT_351401]. Subjects will recover from the anesthetic in the post-
anesthesia  care unit .  All data will be collected by [CONTACT_351402].  
 
Data and Safety monitoring plan includes the formation of a Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). As independent research expert, Board Certified Anesthesiologists [CONTACT_351419] 
and [CONTACT_351420]  will review safety and data information. The DSMB will also obtain the 
results of the interim analysis after 50% enrollment.  
 
12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  
 
All participants will be given an identification number such that identifiable, personal 
information will not be used.  There will be link to MR number. Subjects will be identified to 
collect data and verify the data . Every effort will be made to keep all data collection sheets 
confidential and any electronic data sets will be password protected and secure. Electronic 
documents will be de -identified according to information security policies. Paper documents will 
be shr edded.  
 
13. Potential Benefits:

Version 4, 02/04/2022 
  
There is no benefit to subjects. Use of the RRC may lead to a significant decrease in epi[INVESTIGATOR_351347]. Information gained from this study will potentially improve 
future outco mes in this patient population through reducing complications of nasotracheal 
intubation.   
 
14. Data Sharing;  
 
MD Anderson site will provide deidentified protocol requiring data via REDCap.  UT 
Southwestern team who have  access to MD Anderson Center RedCap will download the de -
identified  data. REDCap ( https://redcap.mdanderson.org ) is hosted on a secure server by [CONTACT_351403]'s Department of Oncology Care & Research Information Systems. 
REDCap has undergone an annual Governance Risk & Compliance Assessment (since May 2014) 
by [CONTACT_38182]'s Information Security Office a nd found to be compliant with HIPAA, [LOCATION_007] 
Administrative Codes 202 -203, University of [LOCATION_007] Policy 165, federal regulations outlined in 
21CFR Part 11, and UTMDACC Institutional Policy #ADM0335.  
 
Those having access to the data include the study PI’s and research team personnel of both study 
sites. Users are authenticated against MDACC's Active Directory system. External collaborators 
are given access to the database once approved by [CONTACT_978], with t heir access expi[INVESTIGATOR_351348] [ADDRESS_436821] of the PI. The application is accessed through 
Secure Socket Layer (SSL).  
 
 
15. Biostatistics:  (omit this section for peer -reviewed research such as cooperative group, or 
NIH- sponsored studies, and for industry -sponsored research which has been submitted to FDA)  
 
Assuming the incidence of bleeding to be 50% and 24% in the control and RRC group, 
respectively,  a sample size of 53 subjects per group (total n=106) are needed. This study is 
designed to have 80% power with alpha = 5%, two -sided. Assuming a dropout of   5%, a total of 
112 subjects (56 in each arm) are required for this study. The sample size calculation was based 
on the chisquare tests.   
 
Baseline characteristics (Demographics, Comorbidities) of all randomized patients will be 
summarized and presented in tables. Categorical variables will be presented as proportions and 
continuous variables as mean (SD) or median (range) as appropriate. The  baseline differences 
between the two treatment arms will be assessed by [CONTACT_351404]/Fisher exact tests for proportions 
and Student t -test/Wilcoxon ranksum test for continuous variables as appropriate.  
 
An intention to treat analysis will be conducted to assess the primary endpoint of bleeding. Logistic 
regression analysis will be conducted to model the primary endpoint between the treatment groups 
accounting for other confounders. Individual logistic reg ressions analyses will be conducted to 
model the secondary outcomes adjusting for treatment groups and other confounders. A univariate 
and a multivariable linear regression analysis will be conducted for those secondary outcomes, 
which are measured as cont inuous variables. A per protocol analysis will also be conducted where

 patients with protocol violations will be excluded from the analysis. All analyses will be done 
using SAS 9.4 and p<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

DO NOT DISCLOSE   
You are being asked  to participate in a research study in airway management that involves nasotracheal intubation .   
Nasotracheal intubation is usually performed  by [CONTACT_1299] a soft breathing tube th rough the nasal passage  into your 
trachea . There are several methods and anesthesiologist can use to place this tube. However, most methods can 
cause nose bleeding  (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]) . The i nvestigators  will compare  two nasal intubation technique s, the traditional  
method versus Red -Rubber tube guidance , used more commonly in children . 
 
The researchers hope to learn which nas al intubation technique will cause less nose bleeding  (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]) . 
 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. 
This web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the web site will include a summary 
of the results. You can search this web site at any time.  
 
Information about Study Participants – “Who is participating in this research?”  
 
You are being asked to be a participant in this study because you are undergoing surgery that require s 
placement of a tube through your nasal pas sage.   
 
How many people are expected to take part in this study?   
This is a multicenter clinical trial. Study participants will be enrolled at Parkland Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_351359].  Up to 130 participants will be enrolled in this study  and 96 study participants will 
take part at MD Anderson  Center.  
 
Information about Study Procedures – “What will be done if you decide to be in the research?”  
 
Screening  Procedures  
• Physical examination : The results of the physical examination done as part of your standard care will be 
used.  
• If you are capable of becom ing pregnant, a pregnancy test will also be done as part of your standard care 
before you participate in the study.  
• Your medical record will be reviewed to determine your eligibility for the study.  
 
The results of the screening exams, tests, and/or proced ures will be reviewed to determine whether you will be 
allowed to continue in the study.  If you are not allowed to continue in the study, the researcher will discuss the 
reasons with you and will discuss other possible options.  
 
Assignment to Study Groups  –  
When it is determined that you are eligible for the study, you will be assigned by [CONTACT_3364] (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin ) to 
one of nasal intubation study groups , the traditional nasal intubation technique versus nasotracheal intubation 
with Red-rubber tube gui dance .  
 
• The control technique  (traditional method) : A tube called as nas al endo tracheal tube will be placed 
through your nasal passage to back of your mouth (oropharynx). The nasotracheal tube will then be 
guided into the trachea (larger airway) under direct visualization with a video assisted laryngoscope , 
which is  a small device to look into your throat and larynx .

DO NOT DISCLOSE  • Red-rubber tube guidance : A soft red-rubber tube will be placed into your nose  to guide the  longer  
tube through your nasal passage to the back of your mouth . Then, the nasotracheal tube will be guided 
into the trachea (larger airway) under direct visualization with a video assisted laryngoscope. This 
technique is commonly utilized in children  to decrease  trauma to your nose . 
 
You will not know whether you are receiving the traditional method or Red -rubber tube method for airway 
placement through your nasal passage.  The res earchers will know which method will be used . 
 
Both procedures for nasal intubation described are considered standard of care. In the traditional method, a  
lubricated nasal endotracheal tube softened with warm water  is placed into the patient’s nostril wit hout Red 
Rubber Tube guidance. Red Rubber Tube guidance is  used more commonly in children and is also a standard of 
care option for  your anesthesiologist.  
 
Study Procedures  - as a participant, you will undergo the following procedures:  
 
• You will be randomized to one of the study group s. Both techniques for nasotracheal intubation are considered 
standard of care.  Whether you are in the study or not, you will undergo  nasal endo tracheal intubation by [CONTACT_351407] s. A tube will be ins erted through your nostril into your trachea (an airway  from your nose to 
your lung)  for airway management during anesthesia.  
• The Investigator will evaluate the back  of your mouth  for any signs of bleeding . 
• You will be asked to grade your pain after  surger y on a scale of 1-10 (0=no pain and 10=worst pain  
imaginable ).  Your p ain will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_436823]-Anesthesia 
Care Unit (PACU) .  
• The s everity of nasal bleeding will be evaluated immediately after placement of the nasal endo tracheal tube.  
• The risks of the study are listed in the risk section. You will be monitored for any side effects during the 
study period.  
 
• You will be in the study dur ing surgery  until discharge from anesthesia care unit (PACU) . 
 
Could your participation end early? There are several reasons why the researchers may need to end your 
participation in the study (early withdrawal).  Some reasons are:  
• The researcher believes that it is not in your best interest to stay in the study.  
• You become ineligible to participate.  
• Your condition changes and you need treatment that is not allowed while you are taking part in the study.  
• You do not follow instructions from the rese archers.  
• The study is stopped.  
 
The researchers will discuss your options for medical care when your participation in this study ends.  
 
Risks – “What are the risks of participation in the research?”  
 
Risks from the research  
The investigators have designed this study to learn how well the nasal intubation with the Red -rubber guidance 
compare s to the traditional nasal intubation method .  The Red-Rubber tube group may not be as good as the most 
commonly accepted tr aditional tech niques .

DO NOT DISCLOSE  Risks from the specific research procedures  
There are risks to taking part in this research study.  One risk is that you may have side effects while on the 
study.   
 
The risk of the red rubber tube technique : 
• Nose bleeding (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]).  This is a common side effect o f nasal intubation. The i nvestigat ors expect less 
nasal bleeding using red-rubber  tube guidance.  There may be a risk for mucosal injury and bleeding with 
Red Rubber Tube -guided nasotracheal intubation.  Water based lubricant will be used to decrease the risk 
of nasal trauma. This risk is not anticipated to be higher than that for standard nasal intubation in adults.  
 
The risk of the traditional nasal intubation technique:  
• Nose bleeding . This is a common side effect of nasal intubation. Water based lubricant will be used to 
decrease nasal trauma.  
 
Side effects from this study will  usually go away soon after nasal intubation .  In some cases, side effects can be 
long lasting or may  cause repeated nasal bleeding . 
 
Everyone taking part in the study will be watched care fully for any side effects.  However, the study doctors 
aren’t always aware of  all the side effects that may happen.  Be sure to tell your study doctor  immediately  about 
any side effect that you have while taking part in the study.  
 
The following section w ill describe the risks related to each your participation in this research s tudy.  You 
should talk to your study doctor about any side effects or other problems that you have while taking part in the 
study.    
 
For more information about risks and side eff ects, ask one of the researchers or study staff.  
 
Are there Risks related to withdrawing from the study?  
If you decide to withdraw from this study early, please discuss your decision with the principal investigator.  
The researcher may ask you to complete study withdrawal procedures.  There is no risk to you if you do not 
complete the final withdrawal procedures and you can choose not to participate in them.  
 
Are there risks if you also participate in other research studies?  
Being in more than one research study at the same time, may increase the risk to you.  It may also affect the 
results of the studies.  You should not take part in more than one study without approval from the researchers.   
Alternative procedures or course  of treatment – “What other options are there to participation in this 
study?”  
 
Your other choices may include placement of a thermosoftened lubricated nasal endotracheal tube into your 
nostril without red rubber tube guidance.  
 
Payments – Will there be an y payments for participation?  
 
There is no compensation participation of this research  
 
What if a research -related injury occurs?  
The researchers have taken steps to minimize the known or expected risks.  However, you may still experience

NO DIVULGAR  Uso de cualquier  fármaco  o disposi tivo en investigación  
Este estudio implica  el uso de un dispositivo en investigación  llamado  catéter  de la uretra multiuso  de Bard.   
“En investigación”  significa  que el dispositivo aún no ha sido aprobado por la Administración  de Alimentos   
y Medicamentos  (Food &  Drug  Administration,  FDA)  de los EE. UU.  específicamente para guiar  una intubación 
endotraqueal  nasal,  aunque  es usado con  frecuencia para este propósito por  proveedores  de anestesia.   
 
Se le pi[INVESTIGATOR_351366]ón  en manejo de las vías respi[INVESTIGATOR_351367]ón nasotraqueal. Por lo general,  se realiza un intubación nasotraqueal  colocando un tubo  
de respi[INVESTIGATOR_149994]ón  blando a través  del conducto nasal  hasta la tráquea.  Hay varios  métodos  que el anestesiólogo  puede 
usar para colocar  este tubo. Sin embargo,  la mayoría  de los métodos  pueden  causar  un sangrado  nasal  (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]).  
Los investigadores  compararán  dos técnicas  de intubación  nasal,  el método  tradicional   
en comparación  con la guía del tubo de  goma  roja,  que se usan  con más frecuencia en niños. 
 
Los investigadores  esperan  saber  qué técnica de  intubación nasal  causará menos  sangrado nasal  (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]).  
 
Habrá una descripción de este ensayo  clínico  disponible  en http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov,  tal como  lo exige   
la ley de los EE. UU.  Este sitio web no incluirá  información que pueda  identificarlo.  Como máximo,  en el sitio

NO DIVULGAR  Asignación  a los  grupos  del estudio : 
Cuando se determine  que es elegible  para el estudio, será asignado  al azar (como  cuando se lanza una moneda   
al aire) a uno de los grupos  del estudio de intubación nasal,  la técnica de intubación nasal  tradicional  frente   
a la intubación nasotraqueal  con guía del tubo de  goma  roja.   
 
• La técnica  de control  (método  tradicional) : Un tubo llamado  tubo endotraqueal  nasal  se colocará   
a través  de su conducto nasal  hasta la parte  posterior  de la boca  (orofaringe).  El tubo nasotraqueal   
será guiado hasta  la tráquea  (vía respi[INVESTIGATOR_351370]  más grande)  bajo visualización  directa  con un  
laringoscopio asistido  con video, que  esun  pequeño  dispositivo para obs ervar  su garganta y laringe.  
• Guía  de tubo  de goma  roja: Un tubo de goma  roja blando  se colocará  en su nariz  para guiar   
el tubo más largo  a través  de su conducto  nasal  hasta la parte  posterior  de la boca. El tubo nasotraqueal   
será guiado hasta la tráquea (vía respi[INVESTIGATOR_351370]  más grande)  bajo visualización  directa con un laringoscopio 
asistido  con video. Esta técnica se utiliza  con frecuencia en niños  para disminuir  traumatismos  en  
su nariz.  
 
No sabrá si usted  está recibiendo  el método tradicional  o el método del tubo de goma  roja para colocación  de  
la vía respi[INVESTIGATOR_351371].  Los investigadores  sabrán  qué método se  usará.  
 
Ambos  procedimientos  para la intubación  nasal  descrit os se consideran  el estándar  de atención.   
En el método tradicional,  un tubo endotraqueal  nasal  lubricado suavizado con agua  caliente se coloca en  
la fosa nasal  del paciente sin guía del tubo de goma  roja. La guía del tubo de goma  roja se usa con  
más frecuencia en niños  y también  es una opción de estándar  de atención  para su  anestesiólogo.  
 
Procedimientos  del estudio:  como  participante,  se le realizarán  los siguientes  procedimientos:  
 
• Será asignado  aleatoriamente a uno de los grupos  del estudio. Ambas  técnicas  para  
la intubación nasotraqueal  se consideran  el estándar  de atención.  Ya sea que esté en el estudio o no,  
se someterá a una intubación endotraqueal  nasal  mediante  uno de estos  métodos. Se insertará  un tubo  
a través  de su fosa nasal  hasta su tráqu ea (una vía respi[INVESTIGATOR_351372]ón)  para  
un manejo  de las vías respi[INVESTIGATOR_351373].  
• El investigador  evaluará la parte posterior  de la boca para detectar  cualquier  signo  de sangrado.  
• Le pedirán  que califique  su dolor  después de una cirugía  en una escala de  1 a 10 (0=ningún dolor  y 10=peor  
dolor  imaginable).  Su dolor  se evaluará a los 30 y 60 minutos  después  de ingresar  en la unidad de  cuidados  
posteriores  a la anestesia (post -anesthesia care unit, PACU).   
• La gravedad  del sangrado  nasal  se evaluará de  inmediato  después  de una colocación  del tubo endotraqueal  
nasal.  
• Los riesgos  del estudio se  incluyen  en la sección  de riesgos.  Se le monitoreará  para detectar  si experimenta 
efectos  secundarios  durante  el período del  estudio. 
 
• Estará en  el estudio durante  la cirugía  hasta el  alta de la unidad de  cuidados  de la anestesia (PACU).

NO DIVULGAR  ¿Podría su participación finalizar  anticipadamente? Hay varios  motivos  por los cuales  los investigadores  
pueden tener  que dar por finalizada su participación en el estudio (retiro  anticipado).  Algunos  de los motivos  
son: 
• El investigador  considera que permanecer  en el estudio no es lo mejor  para usted.  
• Usted  se vuelve  no elegible  para participar.  
• Su afección cambia y usted necesita  un tratamiento  que no se permite  mientras  participa en el estudio.  
• Usted  no sigue  las instrucciones  de los investigadores.  
• El estudio se interrumpe.  
 
Los investigadores  analizarán sus opciones  de atención  médica  cuando finalice  su participación en

Riesgos:  “¿Cuáles  son los riesgos  de participar  en la investigación?”  
 
Riesgos  de la investigación  
Los investigadores  han designado  este estudio para aprender  cuán  bien la intubación nasal  con la guía de  
goma  roja se compara  con el método de intubación nasal  tradicional.  El grupo del tubo de goma  roja puede   
no ser  tan bueno como  las técnicas  tradicionales  aceptadas  con más frecuencia.   
 
Riesgos  de los procedimientos  de investigación  específicos   
Existen  riesgos  por participar  en este estudio de  investigación. Un  riesgo  es que usted  tenga  efectos  secundarios  
mientras  participa  en el estudio.  
 
El riesgo  de la técnica  del tubo  de goma roja:  
• Sangrado nasal  (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]).  Este es un efecto  secundario  frecuente de la intubación nasal.   
Los investigadores  esperan  menos  sangrado  nasal  usando la guía del tubo de goma  roja. Puede  haber   
un riesgo  de lesión  mucosa  y sangrado  con la intubación nasotraqueal  guiada  con el tubo de goma  roja.  
El lubricante  con base de agua  se usará  para disminuir  el riesgo  de traumatismo  nasal.  Se prevé  que  
este riesgo  no es  más alto que el de la intubación nasal  estándar  en adultos.  
 
El riesgo  de la técnica  de intubación nasal  tradicional:  
• Sangrado nasal . Este  es un efecto  secund ario frecuente  de la intubación nasal.  El lubricante  con base de  
agua  se usará  para  disminuir  el traumatismo  nasal.  
 
Por lo general,  los efectos  secundarios  de este estudio desaparecen  poco  después  de la intubación nasal.   
En algunos  casos,  los efectos  secundarios  pueden  ser duraderos  o pueden  causar  un sangrado  nasal  reiterado.  
 
A todas  las personas  que participen  en el estudio se las observará  detenidamente  para detectar  efectos  secundarios.  
Sin embargo,  los médicos  del estudio no siempre  conocen  todos  los efectos  secundarios  que pueden  ocurrir.  
Asegúrese  de informar de inmediato  a su médico  del estudio sobre  cualquier  efecto  secundario que tenga  mientras  
participa  en el estudio. 
 
En la siguiente  sección  se describirán  los riesgos  relacionados  con su participación  en este estudio de 
investigación. Debe hablar  con su médico  del estudio acerca de cualquier  efecto  secundario u otros  problemas  
que tenga  durante  su participación  en el estudio.

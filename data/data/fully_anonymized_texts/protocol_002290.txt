STUDY  DEVICE  The Bashir ™ Endovascular Catheter is a device intended for the localized 
infusion of therapeutic agents into the pulmonary artery and peripheral 
vasculature.  
THROMBOLYTIC  
ADMINISTRATION  Pulse Sprays:  
r-tPA 2mg in 2 0cc 0.9%  NaCl divided into two ( 2) 10cc syringes to administer 
in two  (2) pulse sprays, 1 0cc each , through the basket infusion port with 10cc 
syringe s.  
Unilateral PE : 2mg total in 2 0cc administered in two (2) 10cc syringes.  
Bilateral PE:  4 mg total in 40cc administered in two  (2) 10cc syringes into each 
PA for a total of four  (4) syringes, two  (2) into each PA.  
Infusion:   
Unilateral PE : r-tPA 10mg in  750cc  0.9%  NaCl infus ed at 1.27mg/hr at an 
infusion  rate of 95cc/hr , through the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter  until 
complete. Total r -tPA dose (pulse spray and infusion) is 12. 0mg. 
Bilateral PE: r-tPA 5mg in 500cc 0.9%  NaCl infused at 0. 65mg/hr at a n infusion  
rate of 6 5cc/hr bilate rally through each Bashir ™ Endovascular Catheter , until 
complete for a total r -tPA dose of 1 .3mg/hr, 0. 65mg per hour through each 
catheter . Total r -tPA dose (pulse spray and infusion) is 14. 0mg. 
ANTICOAGULANT  
DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION  Pre-procedure : Unfractionated heparin will be administered IV to prolong  the 
aPTT pre-procedure  (suggested range 60 -80 seconds) . 
Note: Use of enoxaparin (Lovenox®) is permitted pre -procedure for the treatment 
of PE. If Lovenox is given,  then catheter directed th rombolysis  procedure  is to 
start no sooner than [ADDRESS_3515] Lovenox dose was administered . 
Procedure :  Heparin infusion will be discontinued upon arrival in the IR/Cath  lab.  
ACT will be monitored in IR/Cath Lab and heparin boluses  administered  to 
achieve ACT ≥ 200 seconds.  
During r -tPA Infusion : Heparin  infusion  will be restarted  post-procedure  and 
administered  through the side arm of each sheath to prolong  the aPTT (s uggested 
range  40-60 seconds ).  
Post r -tPA Infusion : Upon  completion  of r-tPA infusion , maintain patency 
through the BEC by [CONTACT_3866] r -tPA with heparinized saline TKO using the 
infusion pump.   Starting 45 minutes (± 15 minutes) after  the r-tPA completion, 
administer Lovenox 1mg/ kg sub-Q every 12 hours (±30 minutes) through the 
completion of the 48-hour CTA.

Tropon in I Cardiac troponins are the most sensitive and the most specific biochemical 
markers showing myocardial injury. Elevated troponin can also be seen in 
acute pericarditis, myocarditis, acute PE, severe cardiac failure, sepsis and 
acute renal failure as well as in myocardial infarction.  In acute PE, the 
mechanic load of the right ventricle is increased because of the increased 
pulmonary vascular resistance following pulmonary artery obstruction. That 
can lead to acute right ventricular  dilatation. The dilatatio n and hypokinesia 
of the right ventricle may cause severe myocardial ischemia and increase the 
troponin levels. Increased serum cTnI levels support the diagnosis of severe  
PE.

4.1 Clinical Problem  
Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE)  includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute 
pulmonary embolism (PE). PE occurs when a deep vein thrombus breaks loose  and embolizes 
to the pulmonary artery . Pulmonary embolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death 
after myocardial infarction and stroke and is a major global health problem .1,2    
 
Raskob et al (2014) conducted a literature search and review and found that there is a strong and 
consistent association between  an increase in incidence of VTE and increasing  age. They found 
the annual incidence increased from between 2 and 7 per 1 ,000 population for those 79 and 
younger to between 3 and 12 per 1, 000 population for those age d 80 and older.  This finding has 
major implications  for the treatment of the elderly in the US healthcare system.2 It is important 
to note that 60 percent of the VTE events are associated  with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .3 The number of 
deaths from VTE in the [LOCATION_003] has previously been reported to be approxim ately 300,000 
annually.3,4 Clinically , patients may present with DVT or PE , or both.  With many of the known 
risk factors, advanced age, immobility, surgery, obesity, increasing in our society, this number 
only continues to grow.  Because there is no national surveillance program for VTE, the precise 
number with VTE of all types is unknown.5,6 
 
Patients who present with PE may be classified into low risk, intermediate risk (submassive) or 
high risk  (massive) PE. Both massive and submassive PE cause right ventricular (RV) 
dysfunc tion, while massive PE in addition causes systemic hypotension.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_3827] (CT) to diagnose the PE, 
echocardiography to assess right and left ventricular function, and cardiac biomarkers, s uch as 
troponin I , and BNP  to assess the degree of myocardial ischemia/strain  associated with  the PE .  
Patients categorized as having a low-risk PE do not have  evidence of hemodynamic compromise 
or RV dysfunction.  Low risk PE  patients are not included in this study for obvious reasons.[ADDRESS_3532] been utilized .8-10 However, systemic administration of 
thrombolytics carries a prohibitively high risk of bleeding: Up to 7% intracranial bleeds and up 
to 20% major  bleeding rates;  hence the attraction of delivering thrombolytics in much lower 
dosage directly into the clot to treat this potentially  life-threatening condition.[ADDRESS_3533] been developed and utilized.   The percutaneous devices include  
manual thrombus fragmentation using a balloon dilatation catheter or a pi[INVESTIGATOR_3828]  (off-the shelf 
technologies) . More recent ly, catheters specifically created for thrombus fragmentation  that 
produce greater  fragmentation  of the clot compared to off-the -shelf technologies ment ioned

part without  written permission from Thrombolex, Inc.  previously, without aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3829] ; aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3830];  rheolytic thrombectomy where a saline jet is directed into the clot and the clot 
and saline are aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831] , have been introduced.7-10,12-[ADDRESS_3535] several years a d evice received 510(k) clearance for its ultrasound-facilitated, 
catheter directed low-dose fibrinolysis using r-tPA  (EKOS, Bothell WA). With this technology,  
the EKOS ultrasound device was used to deliver t -PA in patients with massive and submassive 
PE at 1mg/hour over 24 hours (unilateral PE), and 2mg /hour  over 12 hours (bilateral PE).  This 
treatment methodology achieved an absolute reduction in RV:LV ratio of 0.42 (±0.36), the mean 
baseline was 1.55 (±0.39) and at 48 hours 1.13 (±0.2).15,17  
While it is critical to reduce RV/LV ratio, it is of great importance to both short-term and long -
term patient outcomes to decrease the thrombus burden as much as is feasible.  Even a small 
reduction in the clot burden can translate into a marked improvement in RV function and 
improve acute survival. However, much more effective reduction in the residua l clot burden is 
required to reduce the long -term complications of PE, including disabling post -PE syndrome 
and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).[ADDRESS_3536] unprovoked VTE. Therefore , the treatment options for patients who present with DVT 
and/or acute PE must continue to evolve to increase efficacy, decrease side effects, limit long -
term complications, and provide an improved quality of life for the se patient s. This study is 
focused on the  treatment of patients with acute submassive PE with an interventional  device  
designed  to increase the exposure of the thrombus burden to endogenous and exogenous 
thrombolytics, thus this increased exposure has the potential  to greatly decrease the thrombu s 
burden.   
 
The Bashir ™ Endovascular Catheter has been designed to administer therapeutic agents in the 
peripheral v asculature.  Because of the unique design of the catheter, with its six expandable 
infusion limbs, the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter has the ability to: 1. Create a much larger 
central channel for blood flow, thereby [CONTACT_3874]’s own endogenous fibrinolytic agents  
to lyse the clot , and 2. Greatly enhance the radial dispersion of  a catheter -admin istered 
thrombolytic agent throughout the thrombus.  Expansion of the multiple arms of the basket in 
the infusion catheter causes fissuring of the clot. The net result is that a greater surface area of 
clot is exposed to both endogenous and exogenously adm inistered lytic agents, thereby 
[CONTACT_3875].  
 
This first-in -man study will utilize the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter to administer catheter 
directed thrombolysis in patients with submassive  PE who  have consented and meet all 
eligibility criteria.  The Bashir ™ catheter represents a new methodology for localized catheter -
based delivery of thrombolytics.  The thrombolytic to be used in this study is r -tPA (Genen tech 
First -in-Man IND Study            Confidential                IND Number: [ADDRESS_3537] should be distributed all or in 
part without  written permission from Thrombolex, Inc.  Corporation, South San Francisco, [LOCATION_003] ).[ADDRESS_3538] , as described above.  
 
Because of the rationale stated  previously,  a reduced dose of thrombolytic can be administered 
over a reduced period of time due to an increased exposure of the clot to endogenous and 
exogenous thrombolytics  for clot dissolution.  The Optalyse study, using the E KOS  catheter, 
presented at ISET, February 6, 2018, was conducted to assess the outcomes with lower dose r -
tPA administration for the treatment of acute submassive  PE. Four groups were administered 
lower doses of r -tPA over a shorter period of time.  While each group showed a statistically 
significant reduction in RV/LV ratio at [ADDRESS_3539] -proc edure, the reduction in residual clot 
burden was noticeably lower (6%) in patients treated with the smallest dose of r - tPA for the 
shortest time period (4/8 mg r -tPA over 2 hours) compared to those treated with the highest dose 
for the longest duration (2 6% reduction in clot burden; 12/24 mg r -tPA over 6 hours). This 
illustrates the discordance between reduction in RV/LV diameter ratio and reduction in clot 
burden. It is much easier to achieve the former than the latter with low doses of r -tPA for shorter 
periods of time. There is clearly also a lot of room for improvement if 74% of the clot burden 
still remains after the highest dose of infusion in the OPTALYSE study.18  
 
We hypothesize that the dose of r -tPA may be reduced using the Bashir ™ Endovascular C atheter 
from what was administered in the SEATTLE II study, i.e. 24mg over 12 hours (bilateral PE) 
or 24 hours (unilateral PE) , because of its unique features described previously .17 We therefore 
propose to utilize the following regimen: r -tPA 2mg in 2 0 cc administered in 1mg and 1 0cc 
increments x 2 into the PA for a total of 2 pulse sprays into the infusion basket via its infusion 
port on the handle, using a syringe, followed by a 10mg infusion at  1.27mg per hour until 
complete for unilateral PE, and 5mg infusion into each pulmonary artery for bilateral PE, at 
0.65mg/hour until complete for a total dose of 1. 3mg/hour for bilateral PE .  This is a total of 12  
mg over approximately 8  hours (pulse spray 1mg x 2 sprays = 2mg plus infusion at 1.27mg/hour 
x 7.87 hours ( approximately 8 hours = 12mg) for unilateral PE. For bilateral PE, we propose to 
administer the same pulse spray and one -half of the infusion dose into each PA to total the 
unilateral infusion dose, for a total of 14mg administere d including the pulse sprays and the 
infusions. This is a substantially lower dose and a shorter duration of  treatment compared to 
SEATTLE II  for the treatment of PE in a similar patient cohort.  Additionally, an efficacy study 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3832]:LV diameter ratio 
observed in the SEATTLE II study (0.42-0.36) .  The minimal reduction of 0.06 in SEATTLE II  
formed the basis for the efficacy study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3833].  If a reduction is less than  
0.06 ( refer to  Section 18.3)  in the first three patients, the study will be paused to re -evaluate the 
r-tPA dosage and administration.

9.2 Bashir Endovasc ular Catheter Use –  Procedure Steps  
1. Prepare all r -tPA solutions and IV infusion mixtures in Section 9.3 prior to opening the 
Bashir Endovascular Catheter  (BEC).   
2. Prepare the BEC for use:  
a. Ensure that the infusion basket of the B EC can be expanded and collapsed by 
[CONTACT_3883].   
b. With the basket expanded, flush t he basket infusion port with standard flush 
solution. Observe for flush solution exiting the infus ion holes of the basket.  
Collapse the basket.  
c. Flush the wire lumen of the B EC observing that flush solution exits the tip of the 
catheter.   
3. Using a .018in x 300cm length steel core guide wire, such as Hi -torque Steelcore 
Peripheral Guide Wire (Abbott Vascular), introduce the wire into the lumen of the long 
sheath (s) and advance up into the target pulmonary artery.  
4. Backload the B EC onto the 0.018” guidewire and advance towards the long sheath. DO 
NOT insert the BEC into the sheath.   
5. Attach a three-way sto pcock to the infusion basket port of the B EC. 
6. Commence r -tPA infusion  via the stopcock on the basket infusion port using an infusion 
pump. Start the infusion through the BEC PRIOR TO inserting the catheter into the 
sheath. This is to maintain patency during catheter insertion , advancement, and 
positioning in the patient.  
7. Advance the BEC into the target PA.    
8. Do NOT aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3839].  Only maintain 
forward flow by [CONTACT_3884] r -tPA at the prescribed rate 95cc/hour for unilateral PE

handle  of the BEC in the ICU  for approximately eight  (8) hours from start of the infusion 
in the IR suite/Cath lab . The infusion should run at the rate prescribed in this protocol 
until the infusion is complete.  
a. Unilateral PE:  Infusion rate is to be maintained at 95cc/hour  through the BEC, for 
a total of 1 .27mg/hour infusing into the patient  over approximately eight (8)  hours .  
(95cc/hr= 1.27mg/hour x 1 infusion x approximately  8 hours = 10mg total ). Infuse 
the r-tPA mixture until the infusion  is complete.   
b. Bilateral PE:  Infusion rate is to be maintained at 0. 65mg/hour through each 
catheter , for a total of 1 .3mg/hour infusing into the patient ( 0.65mg/hour through 
each BEC).  This is a rate of 6 5cc/hour  per infusion for a total of 1 30cc/h our total 
infusing through two catheters into the patient.  Infuse the r -tPA mixture until the 
infusion is complete  
2. Laboratory Tests : Four (4) hours  (±1 hour)  after initiation of heparin infusion started

the 1st reading  two (2) hours (±30 minutes) after the initiation of the r -tPA infusion and 
then every thirty (30) minutes (±15 minutes) thereafter through the central lumen of the 
BEC.  If a waveform, or both waveforms (if bilateral) appear dampened, verify each 
BEC pres sure transducer is set up properly when study subject arrives in ICU.  If the 
waveform continues to be dampened, document the date and time when the waveform 
becomes phasic and print the waveform fr om the monitor .  Mark on the waveform where 
the systolic P A, diastolic PA, and mean PA pressures are read and retain with the source 
documentation for this study.  Please note that when the waveform becomes phasic, it 
must be documented even if it outside of the “ every  30 minutes” scheduled readings.

Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event  caused by a drug.  A suspected adverse 
reaction is an adverse event where there is a reasonable possibility the drug caused the adverse 
event. The sponsor is responsible for making the causality.

An Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specifici ty or severity that 
has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
It is antic ipated that no unexpected adverse reactions will occur as r-tPA is FDA 
approved for the treatment of pulmonary embolism.  The currently approved 
labeling requires 100mg of r -tPA to be administered intravenously over two (2) 
hours . This is 86mg more than the maximum dose required in this protocol 
administered over two (2) hours, not over approximately eight ( 8) hours as in 
this protocol. 
13.3 Adverse Event  Documentation  
All adverse event s (AEs) including those categorized as anticipated, life threatening, 
serious, unexpected, and suspected  are to be repor ted on the case report form.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_3597] -in-Man IND Study            Confidential                IND Number: [ADDRESS_3598] should be distributed all or in 
part without  written permission from Thrombolex, Inc.  Related  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
agent/procedure – i.e. an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention, 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
intervention, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_3851]’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal seq uence 
from administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that 
could readily have been produced by a number of other factors . 
Not Related  The adverse event is clearly not related to  the investigational 
agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most 
plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is 
inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention 
and/or a causal relationship is considered biol ogically 
implausible. 
13.[ADDRESS_3599] be followed by [CONTACT_3896], including clear pseudonymized 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other 
documents when requested and applicable. All photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_3852]’ personal details and annotated with the patient’s unique study 
identifiers. SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the 
event to  be related to the investigational drug.   Appropriate remedial measures should 
be taken to treat the SAE, and the response to treatment should be recorded. Patients 
must be closely followed until sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to 
normal status or until the event stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.

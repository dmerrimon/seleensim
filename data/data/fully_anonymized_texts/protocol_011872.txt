  applied QD for up to 6 months in pediatric subjects ≥9 years to ≤17  years of age with 
axillary  hyperhidrosis  previously enrolled in Study BBI -4000- CL-105.  
Following completion of the initial PK and safety study (Study BBI -4000- CL-105), 
subjects will be provided the opportunity to enter this 6- month open- label extension 
study. Subjects will be screened for eligibility at Day 8 of Study BBI -4000- CL-105 
(last PK sample collection under BBI -4000- CL-105 study).  Therefore,  for participating 
subjects, the final treatment vi sit (i.e., Day 8 /Visit 4 ) of Study BBI -4000- CL-105 and 
the Screening/Enrollment visit (i.e., Week 0 [Day 1 ]) of Study BBI -4000- CL-108 
(long-term extension study) will take place simultaneously.  
Subjects (parent/guardian) will be dispensed one contain er of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 
15% each month at Visits 1 -6. Subjects (and parent/guardian) will be instructed on the 
correct application procedure for sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% ( to be applied QD 
before bedtime to both axilla for up to 24 weeks).  
Vital signs,  review of concomitant medications , assessme nt of AEs, completion of 
patient -reported outcomes ( HDSM -Ax or HDSM -Ax, Child , and PGI -S), and urine 
pregnancy tests (UPT) for all females will be done  each visit . Application site 
tolerability will be assessed a t all visits through the end of treatment (EOT)  at Week 24 
(Day 168) . Blood and urine for safety testing will be collected and analyzed at Week 4 
(Day 28)  and Week 24 (Day 168)  for routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis 
parameters. ECGs will be assessed at Week 0  (pre-dose, Day 1), Week 4  (Day 28) , and 
Week 24  (Day 168) . A PK sample will also be collected at Week 4  (Day 28) and at 
Week 24 (Day 168) . At Week 12 (Day 84) and at  the end of treatment Week 26 ( Day 
168), the subject will also complete the PGI -C. A final visit will be conducted [ADDRESS_674029] application of study drug . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
parameters , and abnormal ECG  noted at the previous visit, should be repeated  at this 
visit. Comfort measures (e.g., topi [INVESTIGATOR_519662]) 
may be used during all study blood collection events to reduce subject discomfort.  
A total of [ADDRESS_674030] over approximately 26 weeks : Week 0 (Day 
1), Week 4 (Day 28), Week 8 (Day 5 6), Week 12 (Day 84), Week 16 ( Day 1 12), Week 
20 (Day 140), Week 24 (Day 168), and Week 26 (Day 182) . Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study drug will complete the EOT  (Week 24/Visit 7 ) visit.  
An internal Study Review Committee ( SRC) , comprising the Sponsor  Medical Monitor, 
Lead Investigator and Contract Research Organization ( CRO ) Medical Monitor, will 
facilitate the management and identification of potential safety concerns , will assess 
whether revisions to the study protocol and/or consent are requ ired, and will evaluate 
the overall progress of the study.

1. Written Informed Consent (including HIPAA) will be obtained from the 
Parent(s)/Legal Guardian(s) prior to the conduct of any study related 
procedures to permit participation of a minor in a clinical research study in 
accordance with federal and local laws. Additionally, assent from a minor 
child will be obtained in accordance with federal and local laws as well as in 
compliance with the recommendations of the approving Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC).  
Study subjects will be eligible for inclusion in the study if they meet all the following 
criteria at Screening/Enrollment ( Week 0  [Day 1 ]) as applicable:  
2. Are male or female ≥9 to ≤[ADDRESS_674034] enrolled and completed treatment in Study BBI -4000- CL-105 and met 
all inclusion/exclusion criteria, were compliant with study procedures (e.g., 
visits and PK sample collection) , and did not experience any clinically 
significant AEs that wo uld preclude safe continuation of study drug for up to 
an additional 24 weeks . 
4. Continue to be in generally good health based on Investigator's assessment 
(other than axillary hyperhidrosis), with no clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities, co -morbi dities or psychiatric conditions which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_18959], would place the subject at increased risk or would 
confound the objectives of the study.  
5. The Parent(s)/Legal guardian(s) and study subject are willing and able to 
follow all study -related procedures, including but not limited to application of 
study drug and venipuncture and are willing and able to return to the study 
clinic for required study visits.  
6. If female, must be willing to take monthly pregnancy tests during the study .  
7. Sexually active females must agree to use a medically  acceptable method of 
contraception while receiving study drug. For purposes of this study, all 
female subjects are considered of childbearing potential as axillary 
hyperhidrosis generally occurs in post -pubescent individuals . Acceptable 
contraceptive methods include the following:  
a. Abstinence for the duration of the study or where partner is sterile 
(e.g., vasectomy) is an acceptable form of contraception.  
b. Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectabl e, or implantable 
methods started at least 2 months prior to screening, or  
c. Two forms of non- hormonal contraception, including intrauterine 
devices (IUD) (at least [ADDRESS_674035] placement) and  properly 
used barrier methods (e.g., male or female condoms , cervical 
cap/diaphragm, spermicidal agents, etc.).  
The Investigator will educate the subject regarding abstinence or contraception 
options and the correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods 
in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.

Confidential  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background   
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519666] (BBI -4000) is a novel soft -anticholinergic ester analog of 
glycopyrrolate in development for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_519667] .  
1.2 Rationale   
The pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study (BBI -4000 -CL-105) that precedes this long -
term safety extension study, is a short treatment duration (7 days [±1 day]) PK study. The 
purpose of this study is to collect additional safety and tolerability information on chi ldren 
and adolescents  following once daily sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% treatment for up to 24 
wks. Furthermore, s ubjects  enrolled in Study BBI -4000- CL-105 may only begin to perceive 
improvement of symptoms near its conclusion. Therefore, s ubjects who complete Study BBI -
4000- CL-105 will be allowed the opportunity to participate in this long -term extension study 
(i.e., 24 weeks of treatment) in which they may potentially experience additional clinical 
benefit from sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%. The data collected will further inform enhance 
the pediatric safety and tolerability  profile of the study drug.  
1.3 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
The results to date of the clinical program support the safe use of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654] , 
15% for the treatment of primar y axillary hyperhidrosis. Ten clinical studies have been 
conducted with sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519668] 700 adult  subjects to the active 
ingredient: two Phase 1 studies in healthy adults, four Phase 1 and three Phase 2 studies in 
adults with primary axillary hyperhidrosis, and a Phase 2 study in adults with primary palmar 
hyperhidrosis.  
Sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519669] -emergent 
adverse event s (TEAEs) following daily application for periods of time up to [ADDRESS_674043] been mild and transient, with all resolving after treatment discontinuation. A long -
term safety study  (BBI-4000- CL-303) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519670], 15% in subjects ≥12 years of age has been initia ted and is ongoing at this time.

Confidential  4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 General Description  
This multi- center, open -label ext ension study will evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, 
and pharmacokinetics of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15%, when applied QD for up to 6 
months in pediatric subjects ≥9 years to ≤[ADDRESS_674044] udy BBI -4000- CL-105.  
Following completion of the initial PK and safety study (Study BBI -4000 -CL-105), subjects 
will be provided the opportunity to enter this 6- month open- label extension study. Subjects 
will be screened for eligibility at Day 8 of Study B BI-4000- CL-105 (last PK sample 
collection under BBI -4000- CL-105 study). Therefore, for participating subjects, the final 
treatment visit (i.e., Day 8/Visit 4) of Study BBI -4000- CL-105 and the Screening/Enrollment 
visit (i.e., Week 0 [D ay 1]) of Study BBI -4000 -CL-108 (long- term extension study) will take 
place simultaneously.  
Subjects (parent/guardian) will be dispensed one container of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% 
each month at Visits 1 -6. Subjects (and parent/guardian) will be instructed on the correct 
application procedure for sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519654], 15% ( to be applied QD before bedtime to 
both axilla for up to 24 weeks).  
Vital signs, review of concomitant medications, assessment of AE s, completion of patient -
reported outcomes (HDSM -Ax or HDSM -Ax, Child, and PGI -S), and urine pregnancy tests 
(UPT) for all females will be done each visit. Application site tolerability will be assessed at 
all visits through the end of treatment (EOT) at Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]). Blood and 
urine for safety testing will be collected and analyzed at Week 4 (Day 28  [±3 days ]) and 
Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]) for routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters. 
ECGs will be assessed at Week 0 (pre- dose, Day 1), Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]), and Week 
24 (Day 168[  ±5 days ]). A PK sample will also be collected at Week 4 (Day 28 [±3 days ]) 
and at Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]). At Week 12 (Day [ 84 ±5 days ]) and at the end of 
treatment at Week 2 4 (Day [1 62 ±5 days ]), the subject will also complete the PGI -C. A final 
visit will be conducted [ADDRESS_674045] application of study drug. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory parameters, and abnormal ECG noted at the previous visit, should be 
repeated at this vis it. Comfort measures (e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_519671]) may be used during all study blood collection events to reduce subject discomfort.  
A total of [ADDRESS_674046] over approximately 26 weeks: Week 0 (Day 1) , 
Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]), Week 8 (Day 56 [ ±5 days ]), Week 12 (Day 84  [±5 days ]), Week 
16 (Day 112 [ ±5 days ]), Week 20 (Day 140 [ ±5 days ]), Week 24 (Day 168  [±5 days ]), and 
Week 26 (Day [ 182 ± 5 days ]). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug will 
complete the EOT ( Week 24/ Visit 7) visit.  
An internal Study Review Committee (SRC), comprising the Sponsor Medical Monitor, Lead 
Investigator and Contract Research Organization (CRO) Medical Monitor, will facilitate the 
management and identification of potential safety concerns, will assess whether revisions to 
the study protocol and/or consent are required, and will evaluate the overall progress of the 
study.  
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  [ADDRESS_674047] s enrolled in this  study w ill be males  and females , >9 to ≤[ADDRESS_674048] who has been screened  but subsequently fails to meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria prior to receipt of study drug in this study will be deemed a screen failure.  
4.[ADDRESS_674049] will participate in the study for up to approximately  26 weeks , from t he time the 
informed consent form (ICF) is signed/assent provided (V isit 1) through the final visit ( Week 
26 [Day 1 82 (±5 days )]).  
4.5 Early Termination (ET)  
A subject or the subject’s parent/guardian may withdraw the subject from treatment or from 
the study at any time upon request or the subject  may be withdrawn at any time at the 
discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral, or administra tive reasons.   
4.5.1 Criteria for Premature  Discontinuation  
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation from Treatment  
A subject must be permanently  discontinued from the study drug  for any of the following 
reasons:  
• The subject becomes pregnant . 
• Allergic or adverse reaction to the study dr ug. 
• Clinically significant AE , which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], or SRC, would put 
the subject at unnecessary risk if dosing was continued. 
• The subject’s axillary hyperhidrosis  worsens and requires alternative or supplemental 
medication during the study . 

Brickell Biotech, Inc.  [ADDRESS_674050] refuses to stay in the study, then he 
or she will be encouraged to complete the  Early Termination  Visit 7 study procedures . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation from Study  
A subject must be discontinued from study drug and from the study  for the following reason:  
• The subject withdraws consent. From the time consent is withdrawn, no additional 
data should be collected. However, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use data 
collected before such withdr awal of consent.  
A subject may be discontinued from the study drug or from the study  for the following 
reason:  
• The subject requests withdrawal from the study. For the safety of the subject, if 
withdrawal is requested, the subject should be encouraged to complete th e Early  
complete the Early Termination Visit 7 study procedures . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lost to Follow -up 
A subject is considered to have been lost to follow -up if he/she [subject or parent/legal 
guardian] cannot be contact[CONTACT_108866] (or designee)  after 3 documented attempts . 
The Investigator (or designee) will document efforts to attempt to reach the subject / 
parent/guardian . The end of participation for a subject lost to follow -up is documented as the 
date of the last visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Replacement  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue will not be replaced .  
4.6 Safety Oversight  
4.6.1 Study Review Committee ( SRC)  
An internal  SRC, comprising the Sponsor Medical Monitor, Lead Investigator and CRO 
Medical Monitor, will facilitate the management and identification of potential safety 
concerns and will assess whether revisions to the study protocol and/or consent are required 
and will evaluate the overall progress of the study.

safety assessments (i.e., clinical laboratory testing), ECG results, vital signs and AEs 
including applic ation site assessment information throughout the study. Safety assessments 
must be promptly entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system  (if possible, within 
48 hours of notification of event) . Clinical laboratory data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_519692]. A copy of the reports will be maintained as part 
of the source documentation. 
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  [ADDRESS_674052] to be evaluated for study participation:  
 Written Informed Consent (including HIPAA) will be obtained from the 
Parent(s)/Legal Guardian(s) prior to the conduct of any study related procedures to 
permit participation of a minor in a clin ical research study in accordance with federal 
and local laws. Additionally, assent from a minor child will be obtained in accordance 
with federal and local laws as well as in compliance with the recommendations of the 
approving Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Institutional Ethics Committee (EC).  
Study subjects will be eligible for inclusion in the study if they meet all the following criteria 
at Screening/Enrollment (Week 0  [Day 1 ]) as applicable:  
 Are male or female ≥9 to ≤[ADDRESS_674053] enrolled and completed treatment in Study BBI -4000 -CL-105 and met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were compliant with study procedures (e.g., visits and PK 
sample collection) and did not experience any clinically significant AE s that would 
preclude safe continuation of study drug for up to an additional 24 weeks.  
 Continue to be in generally good health based on Investigator's assessment (other 
than axillary hyperhidrosis), with no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, 
co-morbidities or psychiatric conditions which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
would place the subject at increased risk or would confound the objectives of the 
study.  
 The Parent(s)/Legal guardian(s) and study subject are willing and able to follow all 
study -related procedures, including but not limited to application of study drug and 
venipuncture and are willing and able to return to the study clinic for required study 
visits.  
 If female, must be willing to take monthly pregnancy tests during the study.  
 Sexually  active females must agree to use a medically  acceptable method of 
contraception while receiving study drug. For purposes of this study, all female 
subjects are considered of childbearing potential as axillary hyperhidrosis generally 
occurs in post -pubesce nt individuals. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the 
following:  
a. Abstinence for the duration of the study or where partner is sterile (e.g., 
vasectomy) is an acceptable form of contraception. 
b. Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods 
started at least 2 months prior to screening, or  
c. Two forms of non- hormonal contraception, including intrauterine devices 
(IUD) (at least [ADDRESS_674054] placement) and properly used barrier 
methods (e.g., male or female condoms, cervical cap/diaphragm, spermicidal 
agents, etc.).  
The Investigator will educate the subject regarding abstinence or contraception options and 
the correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully 
prevent pregnancy . 
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  [ADDRESS_674055] will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria 
at Screening/Enrollment ( Week 0  [Day 1 ]).

6 DESCRIPTION OF S TUDY PROCEDURES  
A description of study procedures and frequency are listed in the SCHEDULE OF 
ACTIVITIES  and is provided within the content of this protocol .  
6.1  Obtaining Informed Consen t 
6.1.1 Written Parental/Legal Guardian Consent  
Adequate provisions must be made for soliciting the permission of t he subject’s parent(s) or 
legally authorized representative/guardian.  If a subject  turns [ADDRESS_674056]  at the next 
visit.  
The process for obtaining oral and/or written assent  for children and adolescents is similar to 
that of obtaining consent for adults. An effective informed consent process involves at 
minimum these elements:  
• Conducting the process in a manner and location that ensures privacy;  
• Giving adequate information about the study in a language understandable to the 
parent/legal guardian and child/adolescent;  
• Providing adequate opportunity for the parent/legal guardian and child /adolescent  to 
consider all options;  
• Responding to the parent (s)/legal guardian (s) and child’s /adolescent’s  questions;  
• Ensuring the parent/legal guardian and child/adolescent  has understood the 
information provided;  
• Obtaining the parent/legal guardian and child/adolescent voluntary agreement to 
participate, and  
• Continuing to provide information to  parent(s)/legal guardian(s), child/ adolescent as  
new information regarding this research program becomes  available that m ay affect 
their willingness to continue in this study . 
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  [ADDRESS_674057] ( IRB)/Independent  Ethics Committee ( IEC) will determine 
the permissions (one or both parents/legal guardian(s)) required for participation of a minor 
in this study based on level of risk (e.g., minimal or greater than minimal) .  
6.1.3 When Parents/Legal G uardians Disagree  
If there are two parents /legal guardians  available to give permission but they disagree about 
allowing their child to participate in the study, the child may not be enrolled unless that 
disagreement can be resolved. This applies even if only one parent’s (guardian ’s) signature [INVESTIGATOR_20590] . When both parents (guardians) are involved in the decision, they must agree for the 
child to be enrolled. If a parent who was not involved or available for the original consent 
later becomes involved or available, the two parents (guardians) must then agree.  
6.1.4 Assent  
The Investigator should carefully consider and propose adequate provisions for obtaining 
assent of children and adolescents prior to their participating in research. In general , assent is 
usually obtained from a child ≥ 7 years of age, however the approving IRB/ IEC will 
determine  whether or how assent will be obtained. The child should be provided with 
essential information and asked if  they wish to participate in the research study.  
6.1.5 Documenting the Consent/Assent Process  
Consent/Assent MUST be obtained and documented PRIOR to initiation of any study 
procedure s. The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her approved designee must explain the nature 
of the study and associated risks to the parent(s)/legal guardian and study subject. The 
date/time that the informed consent is signed, a brief description of the consent/as sent 
process (e.g., questions asked by [CONTACT_423]), and the name [CONTACT_519718]. A copy of the signed informed consent should 
be provided to the parent(s)/legal guardian. Depending on the approving IRB and local 
requirements, an assent form may be included as part of the consent and may or may not be 
required to be signed by [CONTACT_2252]. Investigators must adhere to their local requirements for 
proper documentation of consent/assent. A summary of assent procedures for execution of 
this study must be maintained in the Investigator Essential Regulatory File. It is the 
responsibility of the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_519672]/assent are familiar and adhere to the applicable 
consent/assent requirements . 
6.[ADDRESS_674058]  demographic information will be recorded at Screening /Enrollment ( Week 0 [ Day 
1]). Demographic information will include date of birth, gender  (at the time of birth) , race, 
and ethnicity. Findings will be documented in the source documentation and the eCRF.  
6.3 Histories  
6.3.1 General Medical /Surgical and Social History  
Relevant medical and surgical history will be recorded at Screening /Enrollment  (Week 0 
[Day 1 ]) and will include medical diagnoses, major surgical procedures within the last 3

medication s and environmental) will also be recorded at screening. Findings will be 
documented in the source documentation and the eCRF. 
6.3.2 History – Hyperhidrosis  
The parent/guardian and subject will provide historical information pertaining to the 
diagnosis of axilla ry hyperhidrosis , including  date of diagnosis . 
6.3.[ADDRESS_674059] month ( 30 days) prior to first dose of sofpi[INVESTIGATOR_519673], 15% under Study BBI -4000 -CL-105 and within 1 week prior to Sc reening /Enrollment 
(Week 0 [Day 1 ]) will be recorded in the source document and on the eCRF. Also refer to 
Section  6.13 c oncomitant m edications and restrictions for additional information. 
6.4 Abbreviated Physical Examination  
The abbreviated physical examination  will include an examination of general appearance, 
skin ( including  specific evaluation of axillary vaults ), lungs, and heart . Additional systems 
will be evaluated as needed.  Physical exam  findings  must be recorded  in the source 
documentation and include the date and name [CONTACT_183131]. 
Physical examinations must be performed by [CONTACT_519693].  An examination w ill be done  at every visit.  
6.[ADDRESS_674060] assessments will be made prior to the Investigator assessments  
(Appendix F ).  
Subject Local Tolerability Assessments:  Subjects will be queried about whether any 
symptoms of burning, stinging, or itching occurred at the drug -application site within the 
previous 24 hours and further whether any  such symptoms persisted longer than 1 hour 
following study drug application. Standardized scales will be used to describe specifically the 
severity of any burning, stinging or itching  (Appendix F ).  
Investigator Local Tolerabi lity Assessments: Investigators will observe for the existence of 
any significant local symptoms of scaling or erythema at the drug -application site. 
Significant local symptoms are defined as those not ordinarily observed following 
application of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_497212]. Standardized scales will be used to describe specifically the 
severity of any erythema or scaling  (Appendix F ).  
Local tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant 
therapy, inte rruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study, will also be  reported as 
an AE.

Confidential  6.7 Vital Signs   
Vital signs will be taken at every visit.  
6.7.1 Temperature and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_519674] (oral or oral equivalent) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_519675] . Findings will be recorded in the source documentation and in the 
eCRF . 
6.7.2 Seated Blood Pressure and Heart Rate  
Blood pressure should always be measu red on the SAME arm (location should be 
documented) and with an appropriate ly sized (e.g., pediatric cuff)  blood pressure cuff (that 
should be the same size d cuff  throughout the study ) for accurate comparison of readings over 
time.  Position is critical for  accurate BP measurements. Therefore, w hen the BP is measured, 
the arm  (cuff) should be at the level of the heart . When seated, feet should be flat on the floor 
(if possible) with back supported and arm supported at the level of the heart (e.g., resting on a 
table). Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) and HR  will be assessed after the study subject  has 
rested in a seated position for at least five (5) minutes.   
It is important that vital signs  be taken either before a meal , or at least 30 minutes after a 
meal or consuming caffeine  containing products . 
6.8 Twelve- Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Investigative sites will use a calibrated ECG machine to obtained ECGs. The ECG paper 
speed will be set to 25 mm/second. Site personnel must assess the quality of the ECG whi le 
the subject is still at the investigative site in the event that an additional ECG needs to be 
performed (i.e., if artefact is present). Subject QT intervals will be reported as corrected for 
HR according to the Fridericia Formula (QTcF).   
TWO ORIGINAL IDENTI CAL ECGs should be printed (1 source and 1 for Sponsor) and 
labelled with Subject ID, and collection timepoint.  The Investigator will read, provide 
interpretation, and sign and date the source document ECG.  
For younger children who have difficulty l ying still, the parent/guardian (caregiver) should 
practice prior to the Day 1 study visit.  It is suggested that parents/guardians be instructed on 
the use of a timer to help the child understand how long to hold still. If possible, have the 
subject rest q uietly for at least 10 minutes.  
ECGs will be done at  Week 0 (Day 1)  [data to carry over from Day 8/Visit 4 of Study BBI -
4000- CL-105], Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]), Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]) and Week 26 (Day 
182 [ ±5 days ]), if abnormal at Week 24.

The HDSM -Ax (Appendix B ) was developed to determine the severity of excessive sweating 
in patients ≥12 years of age with primary axilla ry hyperhidrosis. The HDSM -Ax is a well -
developed, validated measure of patient -reported signs and symptoms that quantifies changes 
in symptom  severity in response to treatment ( Kirsch, 2018). A child version (refer to 
Appendix A ) suitabl e for use in children ≥9 to <12 years of age  (HDMX- Ax, Child) , will 
also be used in this study . The subject will be asked to complete the first 5 questions.

Blood samples will be collected via venipuncture . Measures should be taken to minimize 
discomfort during sample collection including but not limited to diversion or use of a  topi[INVESTIGATOR_67573] (supplied) .  
Total blood volume (TBV) is related to body weight. The TBV of a child is approximately 
75-80 mL/kg. Existing guidelines for blood sample volume limits (ranging from 1 –5% of 
total blood volume within 24 hours and up to 10% of total blood volume over 8 weeks) are 
consistent with the limited evidence available on “minimal risk” to children  (Howie, 2011).  
In this study, t he smallest volume of blood possible will be collected for analysis of safety 
and PK. Blood samples are scheduled to be collected Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]) and  Week 
24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]). Approximat ely 6 mL will be collected for safety , and approximately 
2 mL for PK at each collection time point.  Laboratory  tests may be repeated as clinically 
indicated at  Week 26 (Day 182 [ ±5 days ]).

10.2 Adverse Events  
10.2.1 Definition of Adverse Event s 
According to the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR Parts 312.32 and 320.32 (IND Safety 
Reporting, Applicability of requirements regarding an "Investigational New Drug 
Application"), FDA Guidance for Industry (Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting 
Requirements for Human Drug and Biological Products  and Safety Reporting Requirements 
for Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies in Humans) (Federal Register/Vol. 75, No. 
188/September 29, 2010) and ICH E2A (Clinical Safety and Data Management: Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting):  
• An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
• A suspected drug- related adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE.  
The f ollowing information should be considered when determining whether to classify a test 
result, medical condition, or other incident as an AE : 
• Adverse events will be recorded from the time of informed consent. 
• Abnormal laboratory values should not generally be recorded as an AE  unless an 
intervention is required, the laboratory abnormality is associated with clinical signs or 
symptoms, or the lab abnormality results in study termination or 
interruption/discontinuation of study treatment. When recording an AE  resulting from 
a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical condition rather than the abnormality 
itself should be recorded (e.g., record “anemia” rather than “low hemoglobin”).  
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  21 September 2018  
Protocol BBI -4000- CL-108 Page 37 of 60 
 
Confidential  • Complications that occur in association with a protocol -mandated interventi on (e.g., 
invasive procedures such as biopsies) should be recorded as AEs.  
• Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a 
single diagnosis under a single event term. For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing 
might be grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]”. If possible, abnormal 
laboratory results that meet the definition of an AE  (see above) should be reported as a 
clinical diagnosis rather than the abnormal value itself (e.g., “anemia” rather than 
“decreased blood count”). 
10.2.[ADDRESS_674076] study 
visit will be recorded on the appropriate Adverse Events case report form (eCRF).  
Special cons iderations:  
• Elective procedures or routinely scheduled treatments are not considered AEs. 
However, an untoward medical event occurring in association with a prescheduled 
elective procedure should be recorded as an AE.  
• A baseline condition is not considered an AE unless the condition worsens following 
study drug administration.  
• Death itself is not considered an AE; it is, instead, the outcome of an AE.  
• SAEs that are considered related (i.e., determined to be possibly, probably, or 
definitely related) to sofp ironium bromide by [CONTACT_519700] (see Section 10.3.1).  
10.2.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
For each  reported  AE, the start and resolution dates, intensity, seriousness (i.e., whether the 
event meets the definition of an SAE [ Section 10.3.1]) , relationship of the event to the study 
drug, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome of the event will be documented on the 
eCRF.  
Intensity  
The following definitions should be used to assess and grade AE intensity, including 
laboratory a bnormalities judged to be clinically significant.  
 
Severity  Grade  Description  
Mild  1 Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate  2 Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe  3 Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  
Note: a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Relationship  
The relationship of a  reported  AE to study drug should be assessed using the guidelines 
presented in the  following  table.  
 
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  [ADDRESS_674077] article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; 
and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_47732], and 
reappe arance of the event on repeated exposure (re -challenge).  
Probably Related  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; 
and that is conf irmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_519683]; and that is unlikely to have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying 
illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes.  
Possibly Related  An event that follows a reasonable tempora l sequence from administration of the 
test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; 
but may have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, 
or other causes.  
Unlikely Related  An event that do es not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the 
test article, or most likely was caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, 
procedure, or other  causes, because of their known effects.  
Not related  An event almost certainly caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, 
procedure, or other causes.  
 
Outcome  
Each AE will be characterized according to the outcomes described in the following table . 
 
Outcome  Description  
Recovered/Resolved  The subject has fully recovered from the event with no 
observable residual effects.  
Recovering/Resolving  The effects of the event are improving, or events have 
stabilized (are constant and not expected to improve or 
worsen) but have not returned to baseline.  
Not recovered/Not Resolved  The effects of the event are still present and changing. The 
event is not considered stabilized or resolved.

10.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that is serious (see definition below) and occurs after administration of study drug 
must be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_674078] also be reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of discovery of the event.  
10.3.1 Definit ion and Reporting Procedures  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria . 
 
Fatal:  The AE resulted in death.  
Life Threatening:  The AE placed the patient at immediate risk of death. This classification 
does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were 
more severe.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  The AE required or prolonged an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519684] -ups are not serious AEs by [CONTACT_44134]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519685].  
Disabling/Incapacitating:  Resulted in a substantial and permanent disruption of the patient’s ability 
to carry out activities of daily living.  
Congenital Anomaly or Birth 
Defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient exposed to the study 
drug or study treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy.  
Medically Significant:  The AE did not meet any of the above criteria but co uld have jeopardized 
the patient and might have required medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Every SAE (regardless of suspected causality) should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 
hours of discovery of the event. The processes for reporting and documenting SAEs are 
provided in the study manual. Investigators are responsible for reporting these events to their 
IRB/IEC in accordance with federal and institutional laws and regulations. 
Additional updates from t he Investigator may be necessary as more information becomes 
available on the SAE, and all treatment -related SAEs will be followed until the acute event 
has resolved or stabilized, even if the subject discontinues study participation prior to the 
SAE resol ution. Any new information or follow -up information pertaining to previously 
reported SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new 
or follow -up information. The new or follow -up information should be faxed to the Sponsor 
at [PHONE_10808] or emailed to [EMAIL_9934] . 
Any SAE that occurs after study completion and is considered by [CONTACT_519701][INVESTIGATOR_519666], should be reported to the Sponsor . 
10.3.[ADDRESS_674079] they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If 
a subject or Investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, 
the investigational product must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing 
are available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive or apply further 
investigational product and must be discontinued from the study.  
10.5.[ADDRESS_674080] the pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent 
to the Medical Monitor by [CONTACT_12100] 1- [PHONE_10809] or email at [EMAIL_9934] . The 
Investigator must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study therapy and 
keep careful source documentation of the event.  
Protocol -required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must be 
performed on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x -ray studies). Other 
appropriate pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated, including 
counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_519702] (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the Investigator must report to the Medical Monitor, 
on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow -up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal (period immediately before and after birth) and 
neonatal (infants up to 28 days after birth) outcome.  
Although pregnancy it self is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be 
recorded as AEs (or SAEs – if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Offspring will be followed for a 
minimum of eight weeks.  Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject 
exposed to the test article(s) will be recorded as a SAE and details documented in the 
pregnancy surveillance form. An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic or spontaneous 
will be report ed as a SAE.

Confidential  11 DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 Sample Size Determination   
A sample size of t wenty -four (24) subjects is based on the maximum planned enrollment 
under Study BBI -4000- CL-105.  
11.2 Analysis Populations  
Two populations  will be used for analysi s: Safety and PK.  The definition of these two 
populations follows:   
• Safety  Population : All enrolled subjects who applied  at least one dose of study drug 
and have at least one post -baseline safety assessment . 
• Pharmacokinetic Population:  All enrolled subjects  who applied at least one dose of 
study drug and have at least one quantifiable PK sample for analysis.  
11.3  Statistical Analysis  
11.3.1 General Statistical Methodology

MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term.  
o Adverse events that occurred duri ng the screening period will be listed 
separately and will not be included in the AE tabulations. 
o Adverse events that start on or after first dose will be considered a TEAE. At 
each post -baseline visit, the number and proportion of subjects reporting any 
given TEAE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_926]; each subject will be counted only 
once according to the worst severity reported up to the current visit. Separate 
tables will be constructed for (a) all reported TEAEs, (b) protocol treatment 
related TEAEs, (c) seri ous TEAEs, and (d) TEAEs leading to protocol 
treatment discontinuation . 
• At each visit, local tolerability (burning, itching,  stinging, scaling , and erythema at 
either axilla) will be described by [CONTACT_519704]  F.  
• Vital signs will be summarized similarly as for laboratory parameters but without shift 
tables.  
• Laboratory parameters will be descriptively summarized (mean, SD, median, 
minimum, maximum) for values at each visit and for changes from baseline at each 
subsequent visit. In addition, at each post baseline visit, parameter status (low, normal, 
high) will also be summarized as shift tables vs. baseline status.  
• Descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables will be prepared as appropriate for 
physical examinations, and ECG (HR, RR, QTcF, PR, and QRS) parameters  
• Concomitant medications will be mapped  accord ing to the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary  and will be presented in data listings.

These assessments are to be performed for each axilla individually. The designation of 
“Right Axilla” or “Left Axilla” in the source documents and eCRFs refers to the subject’s 
right and left axilla respectively in all cases. Subject assessments are to be performed prior to 
Investigator assessment s. 
Local Tolerability (Subject):  As reported by [CONTACT_519715], the severity of 
any symptoms of burning, stinging or itching at the application -site within the previous 24 
hours and further any such symptoms persisting longer than 1 hour f ollowing study drug

Local tolerability (Investigator):  The Investigator will assess the drug -application site for 
the existence of significant local symptoms. Significant local symptoms are defined as those 
not ordinarily observed following application of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_119029]. The following 
standardized scales w ill be used to describe specifically the severity of any erythema or 
scaling:  
 
Score  Scaling  Erythema

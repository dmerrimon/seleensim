INGEVITY Study performed 
both BSC and CEC classifications

BSC classifications were used for 
the Safety Endpoint evaluations

used as a confirmation of BSC’s

  4. Introduction  
4.1. Background  
Pacemaker leads are an essential component of a pacemaker system. A pacemaker lead is the 
insulated electrical conductor between the implantable pulse generator (IPG ) and the cardiac 
tissue. The lead is a complex mechanical structure that has to withstand biodegradation in the 
environment of the body, repetitive flexural cycles of the heart, and compressive and tensile 
forces in the extravascular space. Design require ments may include requirements related to 
ease of implant handling, fluoroscopic visualization, the diameter of the lead body, durability 
to last beyond the replacement of several IPGs, performance to stimulate the cardiac tissue 
with low energy, ability t o reliably sense intrinsic cardiac activity, and design with 
consideration of future lead extraction.  
The INGEVITY lead family, including models labeled as MR Conditional and corresponding 
models without MR Conditional labeling , has demonstrated outstandi ng clinical and 
commercial performance and safety. Although the implant performance experience is 
positive overall, physicians have provided feedback on the active fixation models regarding 
difficulty in extending and/or retracting the helix; this occurs d uring implantation when the 
lead is subjected to challenging bends due to tortuous vasculature based on patient anatomy 
and/or when combined with various physician techniques . To address physicians’ feedback, 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific  Corporation (BSC)  initiated a  project to improve the extension/retraction 
performance of the active fixation lead , and has developed, bench tested, and animal -tested 
three new models  of the INGEVITY lead family called the INGEVITY+ lead.  
Three design changes were implemented  in the IN GEVITY+ lead  to achieve the goal of 
improving extension/retraction performance as part of the  physician ’s handling experience 
without compromising the features and functionality  of the original  INGEVITY  active 
fixation lead: 
• Change 1 : The inner coil was mo dified from a uni -filar coil with an  Ethylene 
tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE)  covering to a tri -filar coil with no ETFE covering to 
improve the consistency of helix extension/retraction performance.  
• Change 2: To accommodate the inner coil change, the design of inner coil 
connections at the terminal pin (proximal end of coil) and the coupler (distal end of 
the coil) were  revised to incorporate a counter -bore that allows the inner coil to be 
positioned within the se two components . 
• Change 3: The outer diameter of the distal seal is being increased by 0.001 inch to 
align with the design changes to the inner coil.  
All other design specifications and other aspects of lead performance remain unchanged.   
The INGEVITY+ Active Fixation Pace/Sense Lead Clinical Study will gather data to 
confirm the  safety, performance, and effectiveness of the INGEVITY+ Lead.

5.  Commercial Device Description  
5.1. Commercial Device  
This lead family has the following characteristics:  
• Endocardial pace/sense lead —intended for chronic bipolar pacing and sensing in the 
atrium and/or ventricle.  
• IS-1 bipolar connectori—the industry standard connector to be used in conjunction 
with a compatible cardiac device that accepts the IS -1 connector.  
• MR Conditional —leads can be used as part of the ImageReady MR Conditional 
Pacing System or the ImageReady MR Conditional Defibrillation System when 
connected to [LOCATION_011] Scientific MR Conditional pulse generators ("MR Conditional 
System Information" on page 2  of the Physicians Lead Manual (PLM) ). 
• Iridium Oxide (IROX )-coated electrodes —the electrodes are coated with IROX to 
increase the micro scopic surface area.  
• Steroid -eluting —upon exposure to body fluids, the steroid elutes from the lead to 
help reduce tissue inflammation response at the distal electrode. The steroid 
suppresses the inflammatory response believed to cause threshold rises typi [INVESTIGATOR_674310]. Lower thresholds are desirable because 
they can increase pacing safety margins and reduce pacing energy requirements, 
potentially increasing pulse generator longevity. The nominal dose and structure of 
the steroid are listed in the specifications (Table 5 Specifications on page 30  of the  
PLM ). 
• Radiopaque suture sleeve —the radiopaque suture sleeve is visible under fluoroscopy 
and is used to secure, immobilize, and protect the lead at the venous entry site af ter 
lead placement. The window feature is designed to aid compression of the sleeve onto 
the lead during suturing.  
• Extendable/Retractable fixation —the extendable/retractable helix design anchors the 
distal tip electrode to the endocardial surface without s upport of trabecular structures, 
offering various lead placement possibilities for the tip electrode in the right atrium 
and/or right ventricle. The helix serves as the cathode for endocardial pacing and 
sensing. The helix is extended and retracted using t he fixation tool.  
• Fluoroscopic markers —radiopaque markers near the distal tip can be seen under 
fluoroscopy. These markers show when the helix is fully retracted or fully extended.  
• Lead body —the isodiametric lead body consists of a coaxial design that incl udes a 
tri-filar inner coil and a single -filar outer coil. Both the inner and outer coils are 
designed for MR Conditional use in the MRI environment and provide robust flexural 
fatigue performance. In addition, the tri -filar inner coil provides consistent helix 
deployment performance. The conductors are separated by [CONTACT_17588] a silicone rubber and 
 
i IS-[ADDRESS_911220] ISO 5841 -3:2013.

  Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) lining. The outer coil is covered in Ethylene 
tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) for extra insulation protection. The entire lead body is 
encomp assed in a polyurethane outer insulation.  
• Stylet delivery method —the design consists of an open -lumen conductor coil to 
enable lead delivery using a stylet. Refer to the stylet information ("Stylets" on page 
12 of the P LM). 
 
The INGEVITY+ lead is indicated  for chronic pacing and sensing in the right atrium and/or 
right ventricle when used with a compatible pulse generator.

  7. Study Design  
The INGEVITY+ Study  is a prospective, non -randomized, multi -center,  post-approval study  
utilizing performance goals to confirm the  safety, performance, and effectiveness of the 
INGEVITY+ Lead . 
7.1. Scale and Duration  
The INGEVITY+ study will enroll at least  105 subjects at approx imate ly 20 site s in the 
[LOCATION_002]  to achieve 200 implanted or attempted INGEVITY+ leads.  The enrollment 
ceiling  of 105 will not include attempt , partial attempt  or int ent subjects ; see sect ion 9.[ADDRESS_911224] s may be enrolled per 
site unless prior approval from the Sponsor is obtained . Enrollment is expected to be 
completed i n approximately 12 months; therefore, the total study duration is estimated to be 
approximately [ADDRESS_911225] -implant.

  11. Statistical Considerations  
11.1. Endpoints  
For an INGEVITY+ lead to be eligible to contribute to endpoint analyses, it must be the final 
lead implanted or attempted per chamber during the initial procedure.  Therefore, each 
subject may contribute up to two total INGEVITY+ leads to the endpoint analyses – one each 
for the right atrium and right ventricle.  See section 11.3.1  for specifics on the analysis sets 
used for each endpoint analysis.  
11.1.1.  Primary Safety Endpoint : Lead -related Complication -Free Rate from 0 
to 3 Months  
Safety of the INGEVITY + Leads will be confirmed  by [CONTACT_571380] -related compli cation -free rate 
(CFR) from lead implant through the three -month follow -up, based on complications that are 
related to the INGEVITY + Lead. Lead -related complications are defined as lead-related 
adverse events resulting in permanent loss of pacing therapy, invasive intervention, injury , or 
death. Lead -related adverse events include, but are not limited to the following, based on the 
Advamed Industry Guidance for Uniform Reporting of Clinical Performance of Cardiac 
Rhythm Management of Pulse Generators and Le ads1, and in accordance with the FDA 
Guidance2: 
• Cardiac perforation requiring surgical intervention  
• Cardiac perforation not requiring surgical intervention  
• Conductor fracture/ helix damage  
• Lead dislodgment  
• Failure to capture  
• Oversensing  
• Failure to sense (undersensing)  
• Insulation breach  
• Abnormal pacing impedance  
• Extracardiac stimulation  
 
Lead -related complications associated with attempted INGEVITY + Lead implants will count 
toward this safety endpoint. Lead -related adverse events that are not a complication will be 
counted as a complication if intravenous (IV) drug therapy is necessary to treat the event. IV 
drug therapy that occur s concomitant but unrelated to the lead -related adverse event will not 
be counted as a lead -related complication. Complications involving an INGEVITY + lead that 
occur as a result of a procedure unrelated to that INGEVITY + lead will not count toward this 
safety endpoint. Two examples of this scenario are 1) an INGEVITY + lead dislodgement 
resulting from an ablation procedure and 2) an RV INGEVITY + lead dislodgement resulting 
from a repositioning of an RA lead (INGEVITY + or other market -released).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypotheses  
The following hypotheses will be used to evaluate Primary Safety Endpoint:  
H0:  The lead -related complication -free rate from 0 to 3 months  93% 
  Form/Template 92120219_Rev/Ver C 
          Confidential       INGEVITY+ Clinical Study Protocol, 92424682 , Rev/Ver B 
Page 35 of 61 
  Ha:  The lead-related complication -free rate from 0 to 3 months > 93% 
The performance goal was selected to ensure that the INGEVITY + Lead has a similar safety 
profile in the implant through [ADDRESS_911243] -implant period as other market -approved 
pace/sense leads in the same period. The average of the complication -free rates observed in 
studies used to support mark et approval of various pace/sense leads was used to establish 
average market -approved lead safety. A clinically acceptable delta of 5% was then subtracted 
from this average of 9 8% to establish the performance goal of 9 3%. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sample Size  
A sample size of 200 leads (1 85 required for analysis plus 15 for attrition) is required to 
evaluate Primary Safety Endpoint. This sample size was calculated using the normal 
approximation to the binomial and confirmed via Monte Carlo simulations employing 
Kaplan -Meier methodo logy, using SAS version 9. 4 with the following assumptions:  
• Expected performance = 9 8% 
• Performance goal = 9 3% 
• Expected attrition/missing data = 7.5% 
• One-sided significance level = 2.5% 
• Power = 90%  
The sample size for the INGEVITY + Study is determined by [CONTACT_643772].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Statistical Methods  
Data from all implanted or attempted leads at the time of endpoint analysis will be eligible 
for inclusion in the endpoint analysis.  
The lead -related complication -free rate from date of implant ( or date of attempt, for leads 
attempted but not implanted) through [ADDRESS_911244] -implant will be calculated using Kaplan -
Meier methodology. The 9 7.5% one -sided lower pointwise confidence limit of the 
complication -free rate will be calculated via log -log met hodology for all eligible leads 
contributing to the analysis and compared to the performance goal of 9 3%. If the lower 
confidence limit exceeds 9 3%, the null hypothesis will be rejected.  
Each lead’s exact follow -up time in the 91-day post -implant period wi ll be included in the 
analysis via Kaplan -Meier methodology. The leads that fail to reach 91 days of follow -up 
(without experiencing an endpoint event prior to their end of follow -up in the period) will be 
censored at the time of their end of follow -up in the period. Because non -informative 
censoring cannot be assumed for these leads, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_674315]. The tippi[INVESTIGATOR_674316] 91 days as either having or not having an endpoint event. All possible 
combinations of these leads’ data will be evaluated along with the actual observed data to 
find the point, if any , at which the endpoint is failed. An exact binomial test will be 
performed for the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275].

  11.1.2.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The Primary Efficacy Endpoint will confirm the percent of leads with an adequate mean 
INGEVITY + Pacing Capture Threshold (PCT)  measurement. A lead with an adequate mean 
INGEVITY+  PCT measurement will be referred to as a Pacing Capture Threshold 
Responder.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypotheses  
H0: Pacing Capture Threshold Responders at 3-month visit ≤ 80%  
HA: Pacing Capture Threshold Responder s at 3-month visit > 80%,  
where a Responder is defined by a mean PCT at 3-month visit ≤ [ADDRESS_911245] measurements will be taken using a 0. 4 ms pulse width.   The performance goal of 
80% aligns with current performance goals accepted  by [CONTACT_674327] .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sample Size  
A total of 57 measurements ([ADDRESS_911246]@0. 4 ms) are required to sufficiently po wer the 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint. The following assumptions were used to calculate the sample 
size: 
• Performance goal = 80%  
• Expected rate = 95%  
• One-sided significance level = 2.5%  
• Power = 90%  
The sample size for this study was not determined by [CONTACT_674328]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Statistical Methods  
All INGEVITY+  leads with a PCT measurement taken at the 3-month visit (with a 0. 4 ms 
pulse width)  will be included in the endpoint evaluation.   The number of responders (PCT at 
3-month visit ≤ 2 V) divided by [CONTACT_674329]+ leads included in the 
endpoint evaluation will be calculated.  The one -sided 2.5% binomial exact lower confidence 
limit will be calculated and compared to the performance goal of 80%. If the lowe r 
confidence limit exceeds 80%, the null hypothesis will be rejected.  
To assess the potential impact missing data could have had on the analysis results, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_674317]+ lead s. The 
tippin g point analysis will assign each lead with missing data as either being a PCT 
responder or a PCT non -responder. All possible combinations of these leads’ data will be 
evaluated along with the actual observed data to find the point, if any, at which the en dpoint 
is failed.

  11.1.3.  Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint 1: Sensed Amplitude in the RA and RV  
The eff icacy  of the INGEVITY + Leads will be further be established by [CONTACT_674330]-implant.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypotheses  
The following hypotheses will be used to evaluate Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint 1 for each of 
the right -sided chambers:  
 
Atrial leads  
H0:  P-wave sensed amplitude at three months post -implant ≤ 1.5 mV  
Ha:  P-wave sensed amplitude at three months post -implant > 1.5 mV  
Ventricular leads  
H0:  R-wave sensed amplitude at three months post -implant ≤ 5 mV  
Ha:  R-wave sensed amplitude at three months post -implant > 5 mV  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sample Size for Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint 1 
This endp oint will be evaluated separately for each of the two heart chambers. A sample size 
of 13 atrial leads (11 required for analysis plus 2 for attrition) and 9 ventricular leads (8 
required for analysis plus 1 for attrition) is required for Secondary Effectiv eness Endpoint 1. 
This sample size was calculated using a one -sample t -test, using SAS version 9. 4 with the 
following assumptions:  
Atrial leads:  
• Expected performance = 3.5 ± 2.0 mV  
• Performance goal = 1.5 mV  
• Expected attrition/missing data = 10%  
• One-sided s ignificance level = 5%  
• Power = 90%  
Ventricular leads:  
• Expected performance = 12 ± 6 mV  
• Performance goal = 5 mV  
• Expected attrition/missing data = 10%  
• One-sided significance level = 5%  
• Power = 90%  
Note that the sample size for the study is not determined by [CONTACT_643772].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Statistical Methods for Seco ndary Efficacy  Endpoint 1 
All sensed amplitude data collected at the three -month follow -up visit that is available at the 
time of analysis will be incl uded in the endpoint analyses.

Page [ADDRESS_911247] will be performed, using an alpha equal to 5%. If the t -test is deemed to be 
inappropriate based on the data, then a data transformation or a non -parametric test will be 
performed. If the p -value for the one -sided test is le ss than 0.05, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected.  
11.1.4.  Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint 2: Pacing Impedance  
The eff icacy  of the INGEVITY Leads will  further  be established by [CONTACT_674331]-implant.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypotheses  
The following hypotheses will be used to evaluate Effectiveness Endpoint 3 for each of the 
lead fixation types:  
H0:  Pacing impedance ≤ 300 Ω, or Pacing impedance ≥ 1300 Ω  
Ha:  300 Ω < Pacing impedance < 1300 Ω  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sample Size for Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint 2 
A sample size of 15 leads (13 required for analysis plus 2 for attrition)  is required for 
Effectiveness Endpoint 3. This sample size was calculated using a one -sample t -test, using 
SAS version 9. 4 with the following assum ptions:  
• Expected performance = 650 ± 400 Ω  
• Performance goals = 300 Ω and 1300 Ω  
• Expected attrition/missing data = 10%  
• One-sided significance level = 5%  
• Power = 90%  
Note that the sample size for the study is not determined by [CONTACT_643772].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Statistical Methods for Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint 2 
All pacing impedance data collected at the three -month follow -up visit that is available at the 
time of analysis will be  included in the endpoint analysis.  
Two one -sided t -tests (TOST) will be performed, using an alpha equal to 5% for each test. If 
the TOST is deemed to be inappropriate based on the data, a data transformation or a non -
parametric test will be performed. If  both of the p -values for the two one -sided tests are less 
than 0.05, the null hypothesis will be rejected.

11.3. General Statistical Methods  
11.3.1.  Analysis Sets  
For an INGEVITY+ lead to be eligible to con tribute to endpoint analyses, it must be the final 
lead implanted or attempted per chamber during the initial procedure.  Therefore, each 
subject may contribute up to two total INGEVITY+ leads to the endpoint analyses – one each 
for the right atrium and ri ght ventricle.  These leads will be call ed ‘endpoint leads ’ in this 
section.  The following analysis sets will be used for each endpoint.  
Endpoint  Analysis Sets  
Primary Safety Endpoint  All endpoint leads  
Primary Eff icacy  Endpoint  All endpoint leads with [ADDRESS_911248] data  
Secondary Eff icacy  Endpoint  1 All implanted endpoint leads  with 3 -month visit sensed 
amplitude measurements  
Secondary Eff icacy  Endpoint  2 All implanted endpoint leads with 3 -month  visit pacing 
impedance  measurements  
11.3.2.  Control of Systematic Error/Bias  
Selection of subjects will be made from the investigator’s usual patient load. All patients 
meeting the eligibility criteria and having signed the ICF will be eligible for enrollment in the 
study.  
11.3.3.  Number of Subjects per Investigative Site  
To avoid any center effect and bias, one center will not be authorized to implant or attempt 
more than 20% of the maximum number of subjects, without approval from BSC.   
11.4. Data Analyses  
11.4.1.  Interim Analyses   
Analyses of adverse events and device deficiencies will occur at frequent intervals during the 
course of the study. Results of these analyses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_674332].  
No formal int erim analyses are planned for the purpose of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_674318]. The hypothesis test for each endpoint will be performed 
when all applicable data for that endpoint has been collected.

Page [ADDRESS_911249] of subgroups (with applicable 
definitions in parentheses) includes, but is not necessarily limited to:  
• Sex (Fema le vs. Male)  
• BMI (Obese vs. Non -Obese) 
• Age (< 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years)  
• Race (Black or African heritage vs. other races)  
• Lead Chamber (Right Atrium vs. Right Ventricle)  
• Pulse generator type (pacemaker vs . CRT -P) 
• Pacing Capture Threshold Test Type (In-office vs. Auto -threshold) – applicable to 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  only 
Female sex and minority races are considered under -represented group in most 
cardiovascular device clinical studies. Any efforts to maximize subject retention would be 
targeted t o the under -represented group as well. T he study’s inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are not expected to have a negative effect on  the recruitment or retention of the said 
populations . 
A log -rank test will be performed to assess differences in Primary Safet y endpoint results by 
[CONTACT_6496].  A Pearson’s chi -square test will be performed to assess the differences in Primary 
Effectiveness endpoint results by [CONTACT_6496].  A test for significance at the 15% level will be 
performed. For each subgroup variable in which  a significant difference exists, the results for 
each subgroup will be presented separately. BSC does not plan to seek labeling for these 
subgroups based on these analyses.   
11.4.3.  Pooling  Analysis  
For both primary endpoints, data from the right atrial and right  ventricular leads will be 
pooled for analys is, based on the expected similarity in results across chambers.  The 
assumption of poolability  across chambers will be assessed through the subgroup analysis 
described in Section 11.4.[ADDRESS_911250] of each baseline characteristic’s subgroups will be presented 
along with the multivaria ble model results.  
11.4.5.  Impact of Repeated Measures  
As stated in Section 11.3.[ADDRESS_911251] of repeated measur es on the endpoint

  results, analyses will be  performed  for each primary endpoint comparing a model adjusted 
for repeated measures to one unadjusted for repeated measures.  Results from both models – 
accounting and not accounting for repeated measures – will be presented.  
11.4.6.  Changes to Planned Analyses  
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the analyses will be 
documented in the SAP approved prior to performing the analyses. Changes from the 
planned statistical methods after pe rforming the analyses will be documented in the clinical 
study report along with a reason for the deviation.   
12. Data Management  
12.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded in a limited -access secure electronic data capture (EDC) 
system.  
The clinical database will reside on a production server hosted by [CONTACT_365002] . All 
changes made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for 
review by [CONTACT_322647]. The associated R ave software and database have 
been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system 
compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies pertai ning to 
the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed regularly.  
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_123374] (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written s ignature on printouts 
of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by [CONTACT_1295]. Changes to data 
previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_123342].  
Visual and/or elec tronic data review will be performed to identify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the Medidata EDC system 
and will be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for

Event  
Classification  Description  
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;  
- the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected by [CONTACT_5746];  
- the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying  
or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatme nt 
or other risk factors);  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_262474], when applicable; harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error;

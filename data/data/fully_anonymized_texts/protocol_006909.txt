Abstract  
Modification on 6/20/16 shown in blue  
The sympathetic nervous system provides tonic excitatory input mediated by 
[CONTACT_60224] α1 receptors to the internal anal sphincter. Defecatory disorders (DD) are 
attributed to inadequate rectal propulsive forces and/or impaired anal/pelvic floor relaxation 
during defecation. Anecdotally, many patients with DD have anxiety, but the effects of anxiety on anal sphincter pressures are unknown. DD are ideally managed by [CONTACT_557474] (biofeedback therapy). H owever, a majority of patients with DD do not have 
access to biofeedback therapy and at best, 70% of patients respond to biofeedback 
therapy.  There are no pharmacological options for DD.  
This proposal will assess the contribution of adrenergic α
1 receptors and separately 
anxiety/relaxation to anal pressures in health y and DD .  The  major objectives  are to (1) 
study the effects of adrenergic α1A receptor antagonists on anal resting pressure, with the 
intent of developi[INVESTIGATOR_557465], (2) evaluate the 
effects of anxiety and mental relaxation on anal pressures, and (3) compare rectal compliance in DD and healthy subjects.  Our overall hypothesis is that anxiety increases 
while mental relaxation reduces anal resting pressure via α1 adrenoreceptor -mediated 
increased and reduced sympathetic tone respectively .  The specific aims of this study are 
to evaluate the following hypotheses in healthy subjects and patients with DD: (i) α
1 
receptors  contribute to anal resting pressure but not the squeeze pressure increment; (ii) 
Mental stress will increase anal resting but not squeeze pressure via α1 adrenoreceptors; 
(iii) Mental relaxation will reduce anal resting pressure via α1 adrenoreceptors; hence the 
α1 adrenoreceptor antagonist will attenuate the reduction in anal resting pressure resulting 
from mental relaxation; (iv) Rectal compliance is higher and the contractile response to sinusoidal oscillation is lower in DD than in healthy people; and (v) Alfuzosin will improve 
bowel symptoms in chronic constipation.  
Anal resting and squeeze pressures will be evaluated at baseline, after 
randomization to the highly selective α
[ADDRESS_732163]  alfuzosin (2.5 mg) or 
 
 2 
placebo and finally after randomization to active stress or mental relaxation in 36  healthy 
women and 36 female patients with defecatory disorders .  Thereafter, bowel habits will be 
recorded at baseline (2 weeks) then during treatment with placebo or alfuzosin ER 
(Uroxatral™ 10 mg daily) for [ADDRESS_732164] significant anticipated findings are that 
alfuzosin and mental relaxation will reduce anal resting  pressures, thereby [CONTACT_557475] s for patients with DD.

A. Specific Aims  
The anorectum maintains fecal continence and is responsible for defecation  1.  
Defecatory disorders (DD) result from inadequate rectal propulsive forces and/or impaired 
anal/pelvic floor relaxation during defecation 2.  Pelvic floor retraining by [CONTACT_557476].  However, in the [LOCATION_002], pelvic floor retraining is only available at a handful of centers and not covered by [CONTACT_557477].  A substantial proportion of patients with defecatory disorders do not respond to pelvic floor retraining.  Hence, additional  options for managing DD are 
necessary.  High anal pressures at rest and during defecation may impair rectal evacuation 
in DD.  Conceptually, increased anal  resting pressure may be attributed to the internal or 
external anal sphincters, which are responsible for approximately 70% and 30%  of anal 
resting tone  respectively .  In humans, monkey s and dogs, the internal sphincter  is 
functionally innervat ed by [CONTACT_557478].  Ongoing s ympathetic activity may 
contribute to as much as 50% basal anal pressure 
3,[ADDRESS_732165] not  been evaluated. W e 
postulate that anxiety may increase anal resting pressure via sympathetic stimulation of the 
internal sphincter  and/or predispose to conscious or subconscious voluntary contraction of 
the external anal sphincter, which may also increase resting tone.  Hence, our overall 
hypothesis is that anxiety increases anal resting pressure via α1 adrenoreceptors while 
mental relaxation reduces anal resting pressure.  α 1- adrenergic stimulation also affects 
hypothalamic stress -mediated release of CRF [ADDRESS_732166] extensively utilized to 
evaluate rectal pressure- volume relationships in fecal incontinence i.e., distention with a 
barostat and separately with sinusoidal oscillation 12-14.  
Psychological factors such as stress or depression are known to influence the natural 
history of chronic gastrointestinal  illnesses such as inflammatory bowel  disease ( IBD) [15] 
and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  [16] via the  gut–brain axis. These conditions, and also 
constipation are also associated with dysbiosis.  [17] Furthermore, t he gut  microbiota -brain 
axis appears to be bidirectional .[18] It is thus important to also evaluate the gut microbial 
profile in patients and controls to identify potential interactions between gut microbiota and 
 
 4 
the response to stress, in health and in constipation. We propose to assess this using 16s 
rRNA analysis of stool samples.     
This study will evaluate the following specific aims in healthy subjects and in patients 
with defecatory disorders : 
 
1) To assess the effects of a highly -selective α1A receptor antagonist alfuzosin on anal 
resting pressure, squeeze increment, and rectoanal gradient during simulated evacuation .  
Our hypothesis is that α1 receptors  contribute to anal resting pressure but not the squeeze 
pressure increment  in healthy people and defecatory disorders .   
 
2) To study the effects of mental stress on anal resting and squeeze pressures via α 1 
adrenoreceptors.  Our hypothesis is that mental stress will increase anal resting but not squeeze pressure via α1 adrenoreceptors  in healthy people and defecatory disorders .  
 
3) To evaluate the effects of active mental relaxation on anal resting and squeeze 
pressures.  Our hypotheses is that mental relaxation will reduce anal resting pressure via 
α1 adrenoreceptors; hence the α1 adrenoreceptor antagonist will attenuate the reduction in 
anal resting pressure resulting from mental relaxation in healthy people and defecatory 
disorders .  
 4) To compare rectal compliance and the response to sinusoidal oscillation.  Our 
hypotheses are that rectal compliance is higher and the contractile response to sinusoidal 
oscillation is lower in defecatory disorders than in healthy people.  
 5) To explore the effects alfuzosin on bowel symptoms in patients with chronic constipation.  Our hypotheses are that alfuzosin will improve bowel symptoms in chronic constipation.   
 
6) To evaluate the role of microbiota in the relationship between stress/relaxation 
and defecatory mechanisms. Our hypothesis is that the susceptibility to stress is 
associated with differences in fecal microbiota. B . Research Design and Methods  
This study comprises 2 parts.  Part A will compare the effects of oral alfuzosin (IR 2.5 
mg) and placebo on anorectal functions on 1 day in all subjects (controls and patients).  
Part B will compare the effects of oral alfuzosin ( 10 mg ER) and placebo on bowel habits 
in constipated patients (but not in healthy subjects).   [ADDRESS_732167] majority of patients with constipation and defecatory disorders in our 
practice are women.

and urine measurements.   The formula is eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (Scr) -
1.154 x (Age) -0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.210 if African American).  Based on

Figure 1. Experimental Design for Anorectal Study.   During the stress/relaxation epoch, 
subjects will receive [ADDRESS_732175] periods between the 3 interventions. The manometry catheter will be removed and limited ambulation will be permitted while we are waiting for drug 
concentrations to increase.  Combined, this wait period and the second equilibration period are 70 minutes long, which is within the range of t
max for alfuzosin ( 1.1 – 1.5 hours ).  PAT = peripheral 
arterial t onometry

PAT3. Experimental procedures .  Items a-d below exclusively pertain to Part A,  
a) Anorectal  sensorimotor functions.   After rectal cleansing with 1- 2 sodium phosphate 
(Fleets,C.B. Fleet, Lynchburg, VA) enemas, anorectal resting and squeeze pressures 
and  rectal compliance and sensation will be evaluated before and after randomi zation 
to alfuzosin ( 2.5 mg oral) or placebo (Figure 1)  in the Charlton 7 CRU. During each 
epoch (i.e., baseline or drug), pressures will be evaluated before and after patients are 
randomized to one of 6 sequences (orders) of 3 interventions (i.e., 2 stressors and 
active relaxation).  The same stressor /relaxation sequence will be applied during pre-
drug and post drug epochs. Anorectal assessments, which will be performed with 
standard techniques, include :  
i. Anal resting and squeeze pressures using high resolution manometry, similar to 
the procedure employed in the clinical lab and in recent studies 19;  
ii. Recta l compliance and sensation using a barostat/ polyethylene balloon.  A 
conditioning distention from 0- 40 mmHg in 4 mm steps at 15 second intervals will 
be performed.  Ten minutes thereafter, the balloon will be distended from 0- 44 
mmHg or maximum tolerated pressure in 4 mmHg steps; sensory t hresholds for 
first sensation, desire to defecate, and urgency will be recorded 13, 20 
iii. Rectal ramp distention. Because the contrac tile response to distention is 
influenced by [CONTACT_557479] 20, a ramp distention to 200 mL over 1 minute 
will be performed; this will be sustained for 2 minutes.  While (ii) is useful for 
characterizing quasi -static pressure -volume relationships representing colonic 
tone, ramp distentions can uncover the active contractile response to distention.  
iv. Rectal sinusoidal oscillation will be performed at 5 cpm f or 20 minutes after 
distention to 125 mL.  This paradigm is more sensitive than barostat -driven 
distentions for uncovering increased rectal stiffness in fecal incontinence 21 but 
has not bee n evaluated in constipation  
  
 10 
v. Rectal balloon expulsion will also be assessed in the seated position to 
confirm presence (or absence) of an evacuation disorder .     
b) Mental stressors  and r elaxation method . The mental stress testing protocol will be 
administered under the supervision of a licensed clinical psychologist who is familiar 
with these tests and routinely administers the same. Two stress interventions and a relaxation protocol will be provided in randomized order with 10- minute equilibration 
periods. Two different mental stress tasks of 6- minute duration will be performed. Each 
test is designed to address a different mental skill set. This was designed specific ally to 
prevent mental fatigue and keep subjects motivated. All tasks will have intra- test levels 
of varying difficulty and will be externally paced, with the goal of stressing subjects as much as tolerated as judged by [CONTACT_557480] t ests. It is known that 
external task pacing accentuates the induced mental stress.
22 The aim is to keep 
subjects engaged and focused.  The tasks, which will be performed in randomized order 
are as follows:  
i. A computerized version of the Stroop word- color conflict .23,[ADDRESS_732176] consists of three colored words (red, blue, and green) displayed in 
random order on a computer screen. Each word could appear in either its own color (visually concordant), or in one of the other 2 colors (visually discordant). The subject’s task will  be to enunciate the color of the word, not the actual word 
itself. A rectangular box will surround the stimulus color -word, and this task will 
also be externally paced, with the subject having to keep pace with the advancing box.    
ii. Number subtraction of increasing difficulty (1 digit from 2 digits up to 3 digits fro m 
3 digits) testing math skills.  
iii. Relaxation will be induced by [CONTACT_557481] a CD obtained from Mayo Patient education. In essence, this CD encourages patients to c lose their eyes, 
be comfortable, monitor their breathing , and relax the entire body.  
Before and at the end of each task, subjects will be asked to rate their stress and 
arousal on four 10 mm long visual analog scales labeled tired- energetic, peaceful -
tense, worried- relaxed,  and active- drowsy 
25.   
 
c) Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be taken [ADDRESS_732177] will be calculated as systolic blood pressure multiplied by [CONTACT_4701].  
 
d) Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) will provide an independent biological marker of 
mental stress, which causes vasoconstriction, and the α
[ADDRESS_732178], which causes 
vasodilatation. There is a characteristic PAT signal response to mental stress, with 
diminution of the signal amplitude during stress .  A ratio of the stress PAT amplitude to 
baseline PAT amplitude (PAT score) of 0.8 or less is considered a positive response to mental stress and considered a marker for future stress -related cardiovascular events.

e) Drugs.   After carefully reviewing the pharmacokinetic properties and side effects 
of all α [ADDRESS_732179] opted to use alfuzosin, because it (i) is 
highly selective for urological tissues relative to the vascular system , (ii) has a low risk 
of orthostatic hypotension and (iii) penetrates the brain poorly  27, 28.  For example, i n 
isolated human tissues, alfuzosin displays the highest selectivity  ratio for the prostate 
over the vascular tissue (ratio,  144) compared with tamsulosin (90), doxazosin (51), and 
terazosin (19) .  In experimental  animal models, the primary effect of alfuzosin is a 
urethral relaxant activity and not an antihypertensive ef fect.  Administered intravenously  
to conscious normotensive rats at doses [ADDRESS_732180] hypotensive activity 
compared with doxazosin, terazosin, and tamsul osin. 
Alfuzosin (2.5 mg) has a mean bioavailability of 64%, tmax of 1.0 – 1.5 hours and 
a terminal t half of 3-5 hours  27, 28. The drug is extensively metabolized by [CONTACT_557482] 11% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine.  This immediate 
release formulation, which is also manufactured by [CONTACT_13225] -Aventis, not approved in the 
US but widely available in other countries, will be imported from [LOCATION_006] (Xatral™, 2.5 mg) 
under an investigator -initiated IND (117098) from the FDA  because t he long t max for 
alfuzosin ER limits its use in this acute study.   
f) Stool collection.  Using stool kits and standardized instructions, patients will collect 
stool samples according to the procedure in the Appendix.  Stool samples will be frozen and stor ed in a - 20°C freezer.  The first stool specimen will be collected (a) without a 
laxative in controls and (b) if necessary, after their usual laxative regimen in patients.  
In Part B, the effects of alfuzosin extended- release (10 mg, Uroxatral) on bowel 
symptoms will be evaluated.  Since such use satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR 312.2 
(b) (1), an IND is not required.  We confirm that all the following apply to Part B of this 
study:  
a) The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well -controlled study in 
support of a new indication for use nor intended to be used to support any other significant change in the labeling for the drug; and  
b) The investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising 
for the product; and  
c) The investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in 
a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product; and  
d) The investigation will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for 
institutional review set forth in 21 CFR 56 Institutional Review Boards and with the requirements for informed consent set forth in part 21 CFR 50 Protection of Hum an 
Subjects; and  
e) The investigation will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 
312.7 - Promotion of Investigational Drugs.  
 
f) Genome wide DNA analysis.   Towards our long -term objective of uncovering 
associations between SNPs and DD, we propose to extract DNA from 10 ml of blood, to 
be drawn from study participants. DNA extraction will be conducted at the BAP Lab .  
Genome- wide analysis will be conducted using Illumina 610 QUAD microarray or 
  
 12 
comparable approaches.  Genotype- phenotype correlations will be examined using 
these patients and other patients in ongoing studies.  
 
g) Sequencing and analytical methods.   Using resources available in the UIUC -Mayo 
consortium, two complementary approaches will be utilized to analyze stool specimens from 
each subject . First, microbial DNA will be extracted from stool and tissue samples using 
standardized methods [ 33].  Phylotype profiles of the microbiome from control and 
constipated populations will be generated using deep rDNA hypervariable tag sequencing of 
the hypervariable V3- V5 region of the SSU rRNA gene, which has been validated for use 
with human microbiomes and is one of the methods of choice for the HMP.  With the longer reads from the MiSeq (250x250 paired end reads), our sequencing will include both the V3-V5 RGTs making for a more optimal phylogenetic analysis [ 34].  Phylotype profiles of the 
mucosa -associated microbiome will be generated using rDNA sequencing of the 
hypervariable V3- V5 region, which has been validated for standard use by [CONTACT_557483]. The 3 00 base pair reads will ensure a better optimal phylogenetic 
identification. Barcoding samples prior to sequencing will yield approximately 20,000 reads/sample, ensuring detection of both dominant (core microbiome) and poorly represented taxa (variable microbiome). Identifying the existent taxa, diversity, and ecological relationships within each sample requires that we process large volumes of 16S DNA sequence data. In order to accomplish this task we will follow protocols that we have quantitatively shown to be optimal. Pai red end reads will be stitched, aligned, and classified 
using a custom pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189] (TORNADO v2.0). [35] Briefly, low base quality reads will be  either 
trimmed or discarded, [36] and these reads will not be classified as a bacteria kingdom [37] or 
matched to the bacteria 16S rRNA secondary structure. [38] To evaluate the microbial 
diversi ty and abundance, UPARSE w ill be used for Operational Taxonomical Units (OTU) 
clustering, [39] and FastTree for phylogeny. [40] The 16S data will be  clustered into OTUs at 
97% sequence similarity, and the taxonomy will be  assigned using the Ribosomal Database 
Project classifier. h) Effects of alfuzosin in bowel habits  (Part B) .  During the first 2 weeks, 
bowel habits will b e recorded at baseline.  During the next 2 weeks, patients will be treated 
(double- blind) with placebo or alfuzosin (10 mg) ER once daily, which is FDA -approved dose 
for urinary symptoms.  Symptom assessments are shown in Table [ADDRESS_732181] GI transit during the baseline and treatment periods.  Patients who need rescue medication, after three full 
days without a bowel movement, can receive 1 -2 bisacodyl 5 mg tabs  or a bisacodyl 
suppository (10 mg) or up to Fleet’s enemas.  In addition, patients who need relief of mild pain can use analgesic drugs such as NSAIDs and COX -2 inhibitors for up to two doses per 
week.  During the procedure, intake of acetaminophen up to 1.5g per day in divided doses will be permissible.  
 
4. Data and statistical analysis  
a) Part A.   Anal manometry will be analyzed by [CONTACT_557484], rectal and anal pressure and rectoanal gradient during evacuation 
19, 29.  Rectal pressure- volume relationships will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_557485], rectal capacity, pressure and volume 
sensory thresholds for first sensation, desire to defecate, and urgency  14.  During 
  
 13 
sinusoidal oscillati on, average rectal pressures and the variability in pressures over 
20 min will be summarized 14.  
The analysis will be based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models to assess 
the pre- dug period for intervention effects with subject status and intervention type as 
the primary factors (a check for order effects of the intervention sequences will also be 
made, and the corresponding pre- stress response will be included as a covariate). 
Models with a subject status by [CONTACT_557486].  
During period 2, subjects will have been randomized to drug or  placebo (balanced on 
subject status ) and use the same intervention sequence as the pre- drug period) . The 
analysis of the post drug period will also be based on ANCOVA models incor porating 
subject status, intervention type, treatment group, and corresponding interactions (a check for order effects will again be made). The corresponding responses from the pre-stress interval from period 1 and VAS scores for stress and arousal will be  used as 
covariates , 
b) Part B.  
i. Endpoints.  Symptoms and Signs of Chronic Constipation. The effects of 
alfuzosin compared  to placebo will be assessed by [CONTACT_56620]  
• Bowel habits using  a daily diary  (Appendix 1) to record stool consistency 
(Bristol Stool  Form scale), frequency, ease- of-passage and sensation of 
complete bowel emptying (yes/no)  
• Daily Abdominal Pain Scores ( Appendix  2) collected as (a) most severe daily 
score and (b)  overall average daily score).  
• Global Patient Treatment Assessments report ing outcomes on a weekly basis  
(Appendix 3) including overall relief and severity of constipation  
• Global Patient reported outcomes on a 2- week basis (Appendix 5)  
• Patient reported outcomes of other abdominal symptoms (App endix 6)  
Two outcomes will be derived from primary data.  
- Weekly rate of SBMs:  a bowel movement (BM) i s considered an SBM if no 
laxative, enema or suppository was taken in the preceding 24 hours.  
- Weekly rate of CSBMs:  if the patient indicated that the SBM was associated with a sensation of complete bowel emptying, the SBM will be counted as a CSBM.   
ii. Analysis.  Daily bowel diary responses will first be averaged over study periods 
(baseline and treatment) and in the case of stool frequency, per week.  These responses will also be assessed using ANCOVA models, with the corresponding baseline value as the primary covariate.  For stool frequency, the two weekly values will be assessed using a repeated measures ANCOVA model with the overall average baseline stool frequency value as a covariate.  The global assessment scores (adequate relief and severity) will first be summed over the two treatment weeks, and then assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test .  
Individual adverse events (AEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_557487]  (per subject)  of AEs assessed using the Wilcoxon rank 
sum test.  The analyses will follow the intent to treat (ITT) paradigm with all 
  
 [ADDRESS_732182] their missing values imputed using the corresponding overall mean value from all patients with non- missing data for that 
endpoint.  An adjustment in the ANCOVA error degrees of freedom (subtracting one for each imputed value) will be made to account for the imputation.  A similar adjustment for the Wilcoxon rank sum test (adjusting the degrees of freedom for the t-approximation) will also be examined.  
 
5. Sample size assessment.   The sample size assessment is based on the variation in 
anal resting pressures in healthy subjects and patients with defecatory disorders and 
the effect of the α [ADDRESS_732183] (indoramin) on anal resting pressure in a 
previous study  30.  The CV (%) in anal resting pressure evaluated by [CONTACT_557488] (<50 years old) and patients with defecatory disorders (<50 
years old and resting  pressures >90) was 20% (mean=93.7{SD=18.5}) and 11% 
(mean=102.9{SD=11.7}), respectively. In period 2  the sample size of 36 controls and 36 
patients will yield 18 subjects per treatment arm (drug vs. placebo) in each subject 
group (control vs. patients). This should provide 80% power to detect a treatment effect 
size of roughly 15- 20%, based on a two sample t -test with a two -sided alpha level of 
0.[ADDRESS_732184] size is defined as the difference in 
group means as a percentage of the overall (both groups) mean value. The previous 
study suggested an effect size of 47% for drug effects 30.  For part B, data pooled from 
constipation subjects imply differences between treatment groups of ~4 stools per week, differences in stool consistency scores of ~1.1 and differences in ease of passage scores of 0.8 could be detected with 80% power (2- sided alpha level of 0.05)  
31.  It is anticipated that the ANCOVA models will provide similar power for somewhat 
smaller differences by [CONTACT_557489].  
  
6. Anticipated results and interpretation .  We anticipate that : (i) alfuzosin will reduce anal 
resting pressure and increase the rectoanal gradient during simulated evacuation but 
not affect the squeeze increment ; (ii) alfuzosin will attenuate the augmentation of anal 
pressure by [CONTACT_557490] ; (iii) mental relaxation will reduce anal resting pressure to a 
greater extent after placebo than alfuzosin; and (iv) rectal compliance and the 
contractile response to sinusoidal oscillation will be lower in chronic constipation than in healthy subjects.  
 
7. Potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_557467] .  The anorectal procedures to be used in this 
study are established in our laboratory . While the effects of alfuzosin on anal pressures 
are unknown, the dose used in this study is safe and relaxes the urethral sphincter to 
increase urinary flow . Peripheral arterial tonometry will provide an independent 
biological marker for effects of stress and alfuzosin.  We recognize the given the 
phenotypic variability in defecatory disorders 32, it is conceivable that only a subset of 
patients will respond to an α1 antagonist .  To maximize the likelihood of a response, 
patients with high anal resting pressure by [CONTACT_557491].  E stablished perturbations administered in a standardized 
format will be used to modulate arousal and anxiety and the effects of these 
  
 [ADDRESS_732185] acute effects on 
anorectal functions, it is also sufficient to identify clinically -significant effects on bowel 
symptoms  (eg, bowel symptoms)  31.   
 
8. Innovative aspects, significance, and future directions .  The concept s that mental stress 
can increase anal resting pressure via α-1 adrenergic receptors and the application of 
α-1 antagonists to manage these disorders are novel .  Alternative approaches to pelvic 
floor retraining, which is the cornerstone for managing defecatory disorders, are 
necessary because (i) many insurance programs do not cover pelvic floor retraining; 
and (i i) our experience suggests that a considerable proportion of patients do not 
respond to pelvic floor retraining in clinical practice.  If alfuzosin reduces anal resting 
pressures and increases the rectoanal gradient during defecation, further studies w ith 
the long -acting formulation, either alone or as an adjunct to biofeedback therapy, will be 
considered.  Likewise, further studies to evaluate the effects of mental relaxation on symptoms and to understand the extent to which the effects of biofeedback therapy are mediated by [CONTACT_557492].  Conceivably, the response to these approaches may vary among patients and the acute response to these perturbations may predict response to chronic therapy.   
 
C.  Human Subjects   
1.  Only subjects who satisfy stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and provide 
written informed consent will be included in the protocol.  The consent form details issues related to privacy, withdrawal from studies, and potential risks of studies among 
other items .  The anorectal assessments are extremely safe.  Subjects may experience 
the urge to defecate during rectal distention.  Consistent with all our studies, distention will be terminated if patients experience severe discomfort .  The listed side  effects of 
alfuzosin include faintness/dizziness, vertigo, malaise, headache, hypotension (postural), nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, and asthenia.   Hypotension is 
a listed side effect.  However, even with chronic administration, the risk of hypotension is low. For example, in a study comparing alfuzosin 2.5 mg immediate release tid with 5 mg sustained- release twice daily in 2442 patients, the incidence of hypotension at 1 
year was 1.6%; there were no clinically significant changes in systolic  and diastolic 
blood pressure or heart rate between baseline and [ADDRESS_732186] exper ience of 13,389 patients 
(average age 67 years old) treated with alfuzosin 2.[ADDRESS_732187] atic 
hypertrophy for 3 months, two -thirds of the adverse events leading to discontinuation 
were vasodilatory and occurred in 2.7% of the patients: vertigo/dizziness (1.4%); malaise (0.6%); hypotension (0.4%), and headache (0.4%)  
34.  While alfuzosin ER is 
approved by [CONTACT_1622], the 2.5 mg immediate release formulation is not.  Hence, this formulation will be imported from Europe after obtaining an IND from the FDA.  
 
2. Data and S afety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
  
 16 
a) Subject Safety .  Only subjects who are eligible based on pre- defined criteria, an 
interview and a physical examination, and screening laboratory tests will be enrolled.  
Study procedures are conducted by [CONTACT_557493]. Interventions (alfuzosin and anorectal tests) pose a low risk to participants. Monitoring will be performed during and after the study by [CONTACT_557494].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_557468]. UPI[INVESTIGATOR_557469]- UPI[INVESTIGATOR_557470] (IND required for alfuzosin).  Each study is reviewed and analyzed; study discussions and communications are generally by e- mail and stored.  
Study will be stopped if any rectal perforation occurs.   
b) Data  Integrity. Only subjects who are eligible based on pre- defined criteria, an 
interview and a physical examination will be enrolled. Transcription of data is accurate and complete. Calculations will be standardized and accurate. The study technician will monitor data after every study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_557471] 6 studies.  
c) Subject Privacy . Subjects will be consented in a private room. Adequate time for 
questions will be provided.   d) Data Confidentiality . All records are maintained in pass word protected electronic 
files. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_557472] .  
e) Product Accountability . Research Pharmacy will obtain and dispense medication . 
Unused medication will be collected from subjects at the end of the study and destroyed.  
f) Study  Documentation . Documentation will be per established guidelines during the 
study (hard copy and electronic data capture).  These files will be sampled annually.  
g) Study Coordination. Annual debriefing will be conducted to ensure expectations are 
clear and if educational needs exist.

 Introduction  
Acute myocardial infarction complicated by [CONTACT_115275] (AMICS) is a deadly 
condition with a historical in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_806948] 50%1-3. To date, the only therapy proven 
to benefit patients in AMICS using data from randomized control trials has been early 
mechanical reperfusion3. Accordingly, current American and European guidelines confer a class 
IB indication for reperfusion therapy in the setting of AMICS4. Unfortunately, little progress has 
been made on improving survival with subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including intra-aortic balloon pump 
counter-pulsation (IABP) 5. This lack of progress is worrisome since the incidence of AMICS 
appears to be increasing6-7. 
With the FDA approval of Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) in AMICS, a powerful new 
tool has become available for hemodynamic support. Impella is a transcatheter axial flow pump, 
delivered percutaneous, with the ability to provide 2.5 to 4.0 liters/minute of forward flow.  The 
device should provide sufficient forward cardiac flow to support vital organs in the majority of 
patients who present with AMICS.  Since Impella is the only percutaneous temporary ventricular 
support device approved as safe and effective for use in AMICS, the use of the device has 
steadily grown8. Unfortunately, there is little data available to providers as to the best practice 
patterns associated with the delivery and use of Impella in AMICS. In fact, a retrospective 
analysis of 15,[ADDRESS_1114047] 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629047] a survival rate of 25%, another third of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629047] a survival rate of 
50%
, and yet another third of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629047] a survival rate of 75%.  
   
I
n the summer of 2016, cardiologists from four highly competitive healthcare systems in 
southeast Michigan came together in an attempt to increase survival in patients who present with 
NCSI –  Protocol – (v3.0) – July, [ADDRESS_1114048] Michigan. Patient information was gathered by [CONTACT_806966] a retrospective registry. Outcomes and results were shared during 
quarterly meetings and concluded with a 41-patient pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688]. This initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_806949] a 76% survival to discharge, a significant improvement compared to prior historical 
controls9.  
Give
n the promising outcomes, leaders from around the world have implemented the 
treatment algorithm in their local clinical practices with similar results. We have therefore 
launched the National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative (NCSI). The aim of the NCSI is to bring 
tog
ether experienced centers across the nation who are experts in mechanical reperfusion 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_806950] a large experience with the use of mechanical circulatory support devices to 
systematize care in AMICS. Our goal is to dramatically decrease the duration patients remain in 
cardiogenic shock and attempt to decrease total usage and duration of vasopressors and 
ionotropic agents. We aim to further demonstrate that rapid delivery of mechanical circulatory 
support will improve hemodynamics, reverse the spi[INVESTIGATOR_806951]-hormonal cascade associated 
with cardiogenic shock, allowing clinicians to decrease use of vasopressors and inotropic agents 
and ultimately improve survival.   
Healthcare systems that have agreed to adopt the NCSI treatment algorithm are being 
asked to participate in this prospective registry so that patient outcomes can be analyzed (see 
Appendix 2). Participating investigators will be asked to voluntarily provide data from patients 
completing the treatment algorithm to be included in the NCSI Registry.

 Research Procedures 
           After a patient has been treated according to the NCSI treatment algorithm at the discretion 
of their physician (see Appendix 1), they will be approached prior to discharge and asked to 
participate in NCSI registry, including obtaining permission to allowing coordinators to conduct a 1-
month and 1-year follow-up. This data collection can occur via follow up phone call, electronic chart 
review, or any other method that complies with the site’s SOPs . If the patient is discharged prior to 
obtaining consent, consent form and explanation of the study can be mailed to the patient for their 
signature [CONTACT_187158]. If more than one (1) year has passed, all data may be obtained retrospectively.   
 
If consent is provided, then the following data will be collected (see case report form - Appendix 3):

Risks/Benefits of and Alternatives to Patient Participation 
This is not a treatment study. This is a single-arm prospective registry that captures data 
generated during procedures which are considered standard of care using FDA-approved 
technology. There are no risks other than breach of confidentiality. To mitigate this risk, patient 
identifiers are not being captured, and all data will be stored in a secure REDCap database 
NCSI –  Protocol – (v3.0) – July, 2018 
9 
 (please see below). There are no benefits in participation other than the scientific knowledge 
gained, and the only alternative to participation is not participating. 
 
Data Management 
 Data collected by [CONTACT_806967] a secure REDCap 
stud
y database hosted through the Henry Ford Health System Department of Public Health 
Sciences in Detroit, Michigan. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-
based application designed to support data capture for research studies. A specific database was 
created solely for NCSI in September 2017. The REDCap database that was custom-built for this 
study includes only the specific data fields that pertain to the data points being collected in the 
study, which are present on the case report form (CRF) (see Appendix 3).  
For patients who present to affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_806953], a Patient Exclusion Form will be sent to track the reasons for exclusion 
(see Appendix 4). 
The CRFs and Patient Exclusion Forms from an individual site will be transmitted to the 
lead site, Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], via secure email and accessed only on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-approved, 
password-protected computers and stored on a password-protected and encrypted OneDrive 
sy
stem by [CONTACT_85532]. Access to the OneDrive system and the REDCap database will be managed 
at the lead site by [CONTACT_806968][INVESTIGATOR_307]-approved, 
pa
ssword-protected computers inside locked offices in Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

 APPENDIX 1 
NSCI Treatment Algorithm 
 
1. Conf irmation of AMI Shock  
The diagnosis of AMI is confirmed by [CONTACT_806969] (new ST-T wave changes), detection of elevated cardiac biomarkers or 
angiographic findings of an infarct related artery on coronary angiogram in the presence of 
ischemic symptoms.   
Cardiogenic shock is defined as the presence of at least two of the following:  
1. Hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg, or inotropes/vasopressors to 
maintain systolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg) 
2. S igns of end organ hypoperfusion (cool extremities, oliguria or anuria, or elevated 
lactate levels) 
3. He modynamic criteria represented by a cardiac index of <2.2 L/min/m2 or a cardiac 
powe
r output ≤0.6 watts. 
2. Ac cess, Baseline Invasive Hemodynamics 
Due to the heterogeneous cohort of patients who present with AMICS, any diagnostic 
steps to ensur
e the presence of AMI or CS are left to the discretion of the primary operator (ie: 
ti
ming of right heart catheterization, coronary angiogram and placement of MCS). We do 
re
commend obtaining femoral access to ensure adequate vessel size for MCS. If a right heart 
c
atheterization has not been performed prior to MCS placement we recommend measuring a 
LVE
DP prior to placement of MCS.  In the event a LVEDP ≤15 mmHg,  an alternate diagnosis 
shoul
d be suspected and right heart catheterization should be performed prior to MCS to confirm 
pre
sence of cardiogenic shock.  Following placement of large-bore access and administration of 
s
ystemic anticoagulation an Impella catheter will be inserted and manipulated to obtain maximum 
NCSI –  Protocol – (v3.0) – July, [ADDRESS_1114052] flow. Right heart catheterization (RHC) will be performed for calculation of cardiac 
power output (CPO), SVR and PCWP/RA ratio and pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi), 
during the index procedure. 
3. In tervention 
 PCI of the culprit lesion(s) should be performed, per national recommendations. We 
re
commend against non-culprit PCI unless flow is impaired in the involved artery (ie. less than 
T
IMI 3 flow and excluding chronic total occlusions); however the ultimate decision of multi-
vessel PCI lies with primary operator. PCI can be performed with thrombectomy if a heavy 
thrombus burden is present. Once appropriately sized stents have been implanted angiography 
will be performed to assess TIMI flow. If TIMI III flow is not present, intracoronary vasodilatory 
should be administered at the discretion of the primary operator.  
 Prior to discharge from the cath lab, a formal neurovascular check should be performed 
for assessment of Impella-related limb ischemia. This can be performed either by [CONTACT_28920]-depth 
physical examination, peripheral angiogram, or lower extremities doppler studies. If signs of 
li
mb ischemia are noted, the peel-away sheath should be removed (if not already done so) with 
reassessment.  If limb ischemia persists, antegrade access should be performed to provide distal 
lower extremity blood flow.  
4. P ost-PCI Hemodynamics 
 After the intervention is completed, right heart pressures, cardiac output, and CPO will be 
obtained. If CPO is > 0.6, no further intervention is required. If CPO is < 0.6, right heart pressure 
will be reviewed to identify evidence of right ventricular failure if present (PAPi < 0.9).  
 If evidence of right ventricular failure are present (PAPi < 0.9), or if the Impella is 
suctioning,  operators should consider right ventricular support with commercially available 
devices (Impella or Tandem Heart). Irrespective of CPO, evidence of RV shock is a warning not 
NCSI –  Protocol – (v3.0) – July, 2018 
14 
 to increase alpha agonists. These agents dramatically increase pulmonary vascular resistance 
(PVR) at a time of minimal RV reserve and can cause a lethal spi[INVESTIGATOR_806957].  
 If CPO < 0.[ADDRESS_1114053] device (LVAD) should be considered.  
5. We aning and Explantation 
Impella devices should only be considered for explantation once the following criteria 
have been met:  
1. W eaning of all inotropes and vasopressors 
2. C PO > 0.6 watts without vasopressors or inotropes, and  
3. P APi > 0.9.  
6. S afety and Monitoring 
 Cautious attention should be paid to the infrequent yet serious complication of limb 
ischemia with the use of large bore sheaths and devices. Detailed neurovascular checks should be 
performed while on Impella support. Use of antegrade sheaths to provide flow to the affected 
limb is strongly recommended in such cases.  Prophylactic use antegrade access may also be 
considered, especially in patients who will likely require >24 hours of support.  Although rare 
hemolysis can also occur, daily hemoglobin level should be obtained while on support.  If there 
are signs of hematuria, Impella positioning should be checked via echocardiography.

 APPENDIX 2 
Adoption of the NCSI Treatment Algorithm & Joining the NCSI 
 
Adoption to the NCSI treatment algorithm is completely voluntary. Deviation from the 
treatment algorithm can occur without consultation of the primary investigators at the discretion 
of the primary operator.  All AMICS patients, including those with treatment algorithm 
deviation, can be included in the NCSI registry as there is no formal, nationally accepted or 
standardized protocol or treatment algorithm for treatment of AMICS.  Operators and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_806958].

reaching out nationally and encouraging hospi[INVESTIGATOR_806960]/or treatment algorithms. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_806961], post-discharge, including demographics, 
procedural characteristics and outcomes as detailed in the case report form. Data is de-identified 
and HIPAA-compliant. Data generated from the index procedure admission to discharge (or 
death, if prior to discharge) will be collected retrospectively and de-identified. Prior to discharge, 
surviving
 patients will be asked to consent to the collection of data at [ADDRESS_1114054]-
index procedure. This data collection can occur via follow up phone call, electronic chart review, 
or any other method that complies with the site’s SOPs.  
To f

I. Title  
Evaluation  of the Safety and Efficacy of the OPTIMIZER  System with Active 
Fixation Leads in Subjects with Heart Failure Resulting from Systolic Dysfunction 
(FIX -HF-5) 
 
II. Background Information  
A. Name [CONTACT_51636] l product is the OPTIMIZER  III System, a system capable of 
delivering non -excitatory cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) signals.  
These electrical signals are intended to influence myocardial properties in 
patients with chronic heart failure.  The Sys tem consists of five major 
components:  
1. An implantable pulse generator  with specialized internal components 
that generate the cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) signal (the 
OPTIMIZERTM III device);  
2. Three commercially available percutaneously plac ed leads :  
a. one in the right atrium to sense right atrial activation, and  
b. two in the right ventricle to sense ventricular activation and 
deliver CCM signals.   
For purposes of this study, any commercially available atrial lead 
can be used.  For the ventricular  sensing and CCM delivery leads 
the St. Jude Tendril DX 1388T or 1688T  active fixation lead shall be 
used  (or others as qualified by [CONTACT_51535] );

5. The MONITA Hemodynamic Data Acquisition and Pr ocessing 
System is a data acquisition and analysis system that is used to measure 
acute changes in dP/dt max in response to CCM signals during the 
implantation of the OPTIMIZER III System.  The implanting physician 
shall use this information to decide wheth er or not to proceed with the 
implantation based upon criteria specified in the protocol below.  
 
B. Summary of findings from non -clinical studies that potentially have clinical 
significance and from clinical trials that are relevant to the trial  
1. Nonclin ical studies  
a. Basic research  
Experimental evidence indicates that electrical signals can 
modulate cardiac contractility.  When cardiac contractility 
modulating (CCM) signals were applied to isolated rat myocytes, 
myocyte shortening increased and peak int racellular [Ca2+] 
increased.  This suggested that during CCM signal  application 
there was an increase in intracellular calcium which was the basis 
for the increase in myocyte contractility.  
When CCM signals were applied to isolated rabbit papi[INVESTIGATOR_51481] s, cardiac contractility modulation reached a steady, stable 
state within several seconds and recovered within the same 
amount of time after signal cessation.  Peak tension increased, but 
diastolic tone was not significantly affected.  The CCM signal 
effec t was reversed when the polarity of the signal was reversed, 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54353] -extra -systolic potentiation (PESP).  Furthermore, 
when CCM signals were applied in rabbit papi[INVESTIGATOR_51482] 10 
times the threshold current level simultaneously with the pacing 
stimulus, there was no additional force generation.  This  
suggested that the mechanism by [CONTACT_51536].  
Hemodynamic data obtained from experiments on 17 healthy, 
open ches t dogs indicated that CCM signals applied to the left 
ventricle in dual chamber paced hearts induced an increase in 
cardiac contractility as indexed by [CONTACT_51537] +dP/dt max.  
Increases in LV systolic pressures and aortic flow were also 
observed, wi th a trend towards reduction in end diastolic 
pressure.  
CCM signals were applied in six heart -failure dogs, 
transvenously in four dogs and epi[INVESTIGATOR_51483].  
The results indicated an enhancement in LVP, dP/dt max and ESP, 
in both AAI and D DI pacing modes and in normal sinus rhythm.  
The CCM signal was applied to 16 DDI paced pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], resulting in 
an increase in dP/dt max and an increase in LVP.  
Experiments conducted in healthy dogs suggested that CCM 
signal application to either the left or rig ht ventricle could 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54354] 7 , 2014  Page 7 of 52 improve myocardial contractility with no major adverse effects.  
Inotropic effects were greater from the right side when the signals 
were delivered simultaneously to two electrodes inserted into the 
right ventricular septum.  
 
b. Chronic ani mal study  
A six -month study was conducted in 11 animals to evaluate the 
safety and performance of the OPTIMIZERTM II System under 
simulated clinical conditions.  This study involved seven 
treatment animals and four control animals in which 
OPTIMIZER  II Sy stems were implanted.  In the treatment 
animals, the OPTIMIZER  II System delivered CCM signals to 
the myocardium for seven equally -spaced one -hour periods every 
24 hours.  This signal delivery paradigm was similar to the one 
that will be used in the clini cal investigation.  In the control 
animals, the device delivered simulated pacing signals under the 
same paradigm.  
The safety of the System was assessed on the basis of the effects 
of the CCM signal on myocardial tissue and on lead integrity, the 
changes i n global and regional myocardial function and inotropic 
reserve and the incidence and severity of adverse events.  
At the end of the study, the data showed that the System operated 
as intended and delivered CCM signals on >90% of beats during 
the intended p eriods.  The pulse generator turned on and off 
automatically for the intended periods.   
The effects of CCM signals on gross and histologic appearance of 
the myocardium were indistinguishable from those observed with 
simulated pacing signals.  At lead inse rtion sites, mature fibrous 
material devoid of signs of acute inflammation was observed.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54355] on histologic appearance of myocardium 
remote from the lead insertion sites.   
The myocardium retained normal inotropic reserve, as evidenced 
by n ormal resting function and normal response to dobutamine 
infusion (assessed by [CONTACT_2715] -dependent changes in heart rate, 
dP/dt max, dP/dt min, time constant of relaxation, ventriculography 
and global and regional echocardiographic assessment of 
myocardial functi on).  There was no untoward effect of CCM 
signal delivery over this period of time on lead integrity, as 
assessed by [CONTACT_51538].   
In aggregate, these data suggested that the device operated as 
intended a nd the CCM signals had no identified adverse effects 
on normal canine myocardium.  This study is considered to be 
appropriate to provide some insight into long term safety of the 
system because the testing has evaluated a very wide range of 
myocardial prop erties with no suggestion of deleterious effects.  
The finding of no active inflammation around the lead site is a 
strong indication that there is no ongoing damage created by [CONTACT_51539].  Therefore, it is very unlikely that longer term testing in 
animals  would yield any additional or contrary information to 
what has been identified in this study.  
 
c. Clinical studies  
(1) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_51484]  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_51485] 24 heart fa ilure subjects 
undergoing EP procedures in Milan, Italy.  CCM signals were 
delivered via a Cardima octapolar catheter inserted into the great 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54356] 7 , 2014  Page 9 of 52 cardiac vein (GCV) via the coronary sinus.  The results indicated 
that CCM signals enhanced hemodynamic parameters .  In six 
subjects with left bundle branch block (LBBB), the application of 
the CCM signal was applied in addition to biventricular pacing 
and the effect was additive.   
From the left side experience, the primary findings were:  
 Improved systolic performan ce 
 No significant change in diastolic function  
 Sensation in a small number of subjects, possibly due to the 
proximity of the CCM electrode to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_51486]  
 Difficulty in optimizing lead position in the coronary sinus  
These observations provided th e motivation for testing whether 
CCM signals could be effective hemodynamically if delivered to 
the RV septum.  In a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], as a basis of comparison, 
eleven subjects had CCM signals applied to the right side of the 
heart.  Primary observations  were:  
 Improved systolic performance  
 No sensation in response to CCM signal/application  
 Easily positioned catheters  
A larger inotropic effect from the right side was observed when 
the signal was delivered simultaneously to two right ventricular 
septal lead s as compared to when it was delivered from one 
electrode alone.  
(2) Chronic feasibility study  
A safety study of the implantable OPTIMIZER  System in six 
subjects with functional NYHA Class III heart failure and 
baseline ejection fraction of 35% or less by  [CONTACT_51540][INVESTIGATOR_51487], Italy.  Enrolled 
subjects were evaluated at baseline by [CONTACT_51541], a 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54357] and 24 -hour 
Holter monitoring.  
The CCM leads of the OPTIMIZER  System were standard 
pacing electrodes placed percutaneously and guided to the RV 
endocardial septum.  CCM signal amplitude, delay, duration and 
number of pulses (to a maximum of three) were set during the 
implantation procedure to achieve a minimum 5% imp rovement 
in dP/dt max.  Subjects underwent an acute and a chronic phase of 
monitored CCM signal application or sham signal application, 
five days per week.  Follow -up testing included echocardiograms, 
24-hour Holter monitor tests, cardiopulmonary stress tes ts, [ADDRESS_54358].  
(3) Chronic safety and performance study (FIX -HF-3 Study)  
A clinical investigation was conducted to evaluate the safety and 
functionality of the OPTIMIZER  II System in subjects with 
[LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure.  
Twenty -two subjects underwent OPTIMIZER™ II System 
implantation.  Subject s underwent application of CCM signals for 
three consecutive hours a day for eight weeks after implantation.  
Device interrogations indicated that CCM signals were delivered 
for the intended 180 minutes per day and on approximately 
84±16% (median 90%) of no rmal sinus beats.  CCM signals were 
appropriately delivered during the relative refractory period 
(between the QRS complex and the onset of the T -wave) and 
were suppressed on PVCs as designed.   
The data indicated that subject symptoms improved during the 
study.  From Class III at entry, NYHA class decreased in three 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54359] 7 , 2014  Page 11 of 52 subjects to Class I, in 15 subjects to Class II and in two subjects, 
it was unchanged.  Minnessotta Living with Heart Failure 
Questionnaire (MLWHFQ) scores decreased from baseline value 
of 41.9 ±22.2 to 23.6±17.9 (mean reduction of 16.9±21.9, 
p=0.0027).  Ejection fraction increased from the baseline value of 
21.4±6.3% to 27.4±7.0% at eight weeks (mean increase 
5.9±6.4%, p=0.0006).  There was no significant change in heart 
rate (76±11, median 75),  number of PVCs per hour (70.8±176.7, 
median 21.4), number of runs of non -sustained ventricular 
tachycardia per hour (0.04±0.10, median 0.02), or the number of 
premature atrial contractions per hour (17.2±46.8, median 1.7).   
There were four deaths (two du ring the study period and two after 
study completion), three apparently from cardiac causes in 
subjects with severe heart failure at high risk of mortality.  The 
fourth death was due to a massive pulmonary embolism caused 
by [CONTACT_51542] .  A subject with a heart 
transplant on chronic immuno -suppressive therapy who suffered 
from chronic rejection and who was treated with the 
OPTIMIZER™ II system on a compassionate basis but who was 
followed according to the protocol, died of sepsis.  All s ubjects 
continue to be followed closely.  
Overall, the rate and severity of adverse events were generally 
expected for patients with severe heart failure within the context 
of a study of a device -based treatment for heart failure, and were 
observed with a f requency similar to that of a recent study of 
biventricular pacing.  Seventy adverse events were reported, most 
commonly palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], shortness of breath, dizziness and water 
retention.  Twenty events in 11 subjects were classified as serious 
and/or sever e.  Nine events occurring in five subjects were 
classified as device -related.  The most common device -related 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54360] 7 , 2014  Page 12 of 52 events were pocket hematoma and stimulation sensation.  In 
aggregate, these results indicate that the OPTIMIZER™ II 
System operates as intended, i s safe and its use is associated with 
improvements in symptoms of heart failure.   
(4) Increased Duration of Exposure to CCM Signals (FIX -HF-3 
Extension Study)  
Fourteen of the patients who participated in the study described 
in (3) above participated in a second clinical study to investigate 
the effects of increased duration of CCM treatment.  In these 
subjects, the OPTIMIZER II device was programmed to deliver 
CCM signal for 7 noncontiguous hours per day (7 cycles of 1 
hour on, 2 hours 24 minutes off) for 6 months.  Upon entry into 
this increased dose safety study, the clinical status was markedly 
improved compared to their original baseline status prior to 
having received CCM treatment.  NYHA averaged 1.6±0.5, 
MLWHFQ averaged 9.6±6.2, 6MW averaged 471±121,  peak 
VO2 averaged 1065±215 ml O2/min (~14.0±2.8 ml O 2/kg/min) 
and ejection fraction averaged 35±9%.  Over the 24 week follow -
up period, the clinical parameters were maintained at relatively 
constant levels, except for peak VO 2 which increased to 
1201±343 ml O 2/min (15.8±4.5 ml O 2/kg/min; p=0.02).  Medical 
therapy for heart failure did not change in a majority of patients 
during this study, and there was an approximately equal number 
of instances when medication use was increased as when it was 
decreased.   
During the 8 week period of the original FIX -HF-3 study 
described above, there were 43 adverse events reported in these 
14 study subjects.  Ten of these events were classified as serious 
and/or severe.  Twelve of the events were classified by [CONTACT_51543], possibly or probably related to 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54361], during the 24 week period of the present 
FIX-HF-3 Extension study, there were a total of 43 adverse 
events of which three were classified as serious and 14 were 
classified  as being definitely, possibly or probably related to the 
device.  Thus, the rate (number of AEs/time) and severity 
(number of serious AEs) of adverse events was significantly 
lower in the FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_54362] that the OPTIMIZER™ 
System  operates as intended, and appears to be safe when set to 
deliver CCM pulses for 7 hours/day and that further study of the 
OPTIMIZER II system in patients with chronic heart failure 
within the context of randomized, blinded trials to rigorously 
evaluate th e safety and efficacy of this form of treatment are 
warranted.  
 
C. Summary of the known and potential risks and benefits, if any, to human 
subjects.  
1. Known Potential Risks  
The results of bench testing, from preclinical studies using prototype 
devices in ani mals and from preliminary clinical studies suggest that 
acute applications of CCM signals present no undue risk to subjects.  
However, there are recognized risks associated with the heart failure 
state itself, with interventional cardiovascular procedures in heart failure 
patients and potentially with the use of the OPTIMIZER™ system.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54363] 7 , 2014  Page 14 of 52 a. Death  
Class III and IV heart failure patients are at risk for death from 
their underlying disease, with annual mortality rates ranging from 
~20% for Class III patients to a s high as ~75% for Class IV 
patients.  With any invasive cardiovascular procedure in heart 
failure patients there may be added risk of death.  Applying 
appropriate subject selection criteria, using meticulous techniques 
and providing attentive post -procedu re care will minimize the 
risks associated with these procedures.  
b. Risks associated with placement of a Millar catheter   
During implantation of the OPTIMIZER  pulse generator, a 
Millar catheter will be temporarily placed into the left ventricle in 
order  to measure the peak rate of LV pressure rise (dP/dt max).  
The catheter will be inserted via standard percutaneous 
cannulation of a femoral artery.  The risks associated with 
temporary placement of the Millar catheter include infection, 
bleeding, ventricul ar arrhythmias, and damage to the femoral 
artery, aorta or ventricle.  These risks are minimized by [CONTACT_51544].  
c. Risks of implantation of the OPTIMIZ ER pulse generator  
The risks associated with implantation of the OPTIMIZER  
pulse generator are similar to those of implanting a permanent 
pacemaker, which are well characterized and include (but are not 
limited to) infection, bleeding, pneumothorax, myoc ardial 
perforation by [CONTACT_51545].  Applying 
appropriate subject selection criteria, using meticulous surgical 
technique and providing careful post -operative care will 
minimize the risks associated with these procedures.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54364] 7 , 2014  Page 15 of 52 d. Arrh ythmias and/or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_51488] a result of CCM signal application.  
Arrhythmias may include bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias 
as well as ventricular arrhythmias or supraventricular arrhythmia s 
and may be associated with palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814].  These may include 
sinus bradycardia, complete heart block, junctional rhythm, 
asystole, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, 
paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, 
premat ure atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions, 
nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular 
fibrillation, electromechanical dissociation, or cardiac arrest.  
Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_51489].  Safety 
algorithms intended to minimize the incidence of arrhythmias 
have been incorporated into the OPTIMIZER  System.   
e. Myocardial damage  
Tissue damage may occur at the points where the leads are 
inserted into the heart muscle.  The histologic results of 
laboratory animal testing have indicated that application of CCM 
signals through the leads does not induce any clinically 
significant amount of myocardial damage.   
f. Infection  
The implantable compone nts of the OPTIMIZER  System are 
supplied sterile.  The risk of post -implantation infection is 
minimized by [CONTACT_51546].  Infectious complications may include localized 
infections (infections of the devic e pocket, femoral cannulation 
sites, cellulitis, pneumonia, etc) and sepsis.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54365] 7 , 2014  Page 16 of 52 g. Thromboembolic Events  
Thrombosis or embolism may occur as a result of the placement 
of the leads for the OPTIMIZER  II System or as a result of the 
underlying disease.  These events may include deep vein 
thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and 
mesenteric thrombosis.  Since there is only one additional lead 
compared to a normal dual chamber pacemaker, the added risk is 
considered to be not clinically significan t. 
h. Right or Left Bundle Branch Block  
Insertion of pacemaker leads on the right ventricular septum can 
occasionally cause transient interruption of the specialized 
conduction system of the heart, which can lead to bundle branch 
block.     
i. Worsened hea rt failure  
CCM signal application is intended to improve the strength of the 
heart beat and lessen symptoms of heart failure.  However, if 
signal application is ineffective, the subject may experience the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_51490], including shortness of breath at rest or on exertion, 
fluid accumulation and pleural effusion, cardiogenic shock, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (possibly with the need for mec hanical 
ventilation) or may require alteration of medication doses.  
j. Risk of Myocardial Perforation  
There is a risk of right ventricular perforation with insertion of 
any pacemaker lead.  If this happened it could result in fluid 
(including blood) accumu lation around the heart (as in a 
pericardial effusion) that could compromise ventricular function 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54366] generally been 
short –lived and have been resolved by [CONTACT_51547].  Oc casionally an invasive procedure may be required to 
reposition the leads.  
m. Neurologic events  
In addition to the risks discussed above, patients with heart 
failure are at risk for risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and 
stroke.   
n. Potential for OPT IMIZER – ICD/Pacemaker interactions  
 It is possible that the presence of CCM pulses could be sensed by 
[CONTACT_51548].  In such a case, an inappropriate ICD shock could be 
delivered.  Similarly, if a  pacemaker inappropriately sensed a 
CCM pulse for a cardiac depolarization, the pacemaker could be 
inhibited from delivering treatment during a bradycardia (such as 
a sinus bradycardia).  Device interaction testing has indicated that 
these do not occur whe n true bipolar ICD leads are used and 
when both devices are programmed properly.  To minimize this 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54367] 7 , 2014  Page 18 of 52 risk, all personnel involved with programming the OPTIMIZER 
device are appropriately trained in proper device programming.  
o. Surgical revision  of the Optimi zer System  
There is a potential that any system component could 
malfunction, become damaged, infected, or, in the case of the 
leads, become dislodged.  System component malfunction or 
other clinical circumstances (eg, sepsis) may require noninvasive 
correc tive actions or possibly even a surgical revision 
(repositioning, replacement, or removal) of the malfunctioning 
component(s).   
p. General Medical  
Patients with heart failure may experience adverse events related 
to their underlying disease and such may be encountered during 
the course of the study.  These may include hypotension, 
dizziness, syncope, worsening renal function, worsening liver 
failure, anemia, etc.  
2. Known Potential Benefits  
a. CCM signal application  
Based upon available evidence from pre clinical laboratory animal 
studies and preliminary clinical safety studies, application of non -
excitatory electrical CCM signals to the heart muscle during the 
absolute refractory period can increase the strength of the heart’s 
contraction.  Subjects recei ving CCM signal application may 
experience improvement in myocardial contractility (e.g., 
increased ejection fraction), which could be associated with 
improved exercise tolerance, fewer symptoms of heart failure and 
increased overall quality of life.   
 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54368] a specified duration and amplitude (voltage), 
which have been determined in prior pre -clinical and clinical studies.  The 
maximal voltage (7.7V) is delivered unless the subject experiences a side effect 
(e.g., muscular stimulation, sensatio n), in which case the voltage may be 
decreased.   
The “dose” of CCM signals is determined primarily by [CONTACT_51549].  Results of the chronic safety and performance 
study that took place in the European Union (des cribed above) suggest that three 
hours of CCM signal application results in clinical benefit in a majority of 
subjects.  Several subjects initially involved in that study were followed at an 
increased dose (7 hours of CCM signal per day).  The results of t hat study 
suggested no increase in risk and potentially mild improvements over the 3 hour 
per day regimen.  Phase I of the present study utilized an intermediate dose of 5 
hour/day signal delivery paradigm in order to permit 6 month device longevity 
of the  OPTIMIZER™ II system.  Since the safety profile during Phase I of the 
study has been clinically acceptable and for consistency, the present study shall 
continue to use the 5 hour/day dose.

E. Statement that the trial will be conducted in compliance wit h the protocol, 
GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements.  
This clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and 
the applicable regulatory requirements.  
F. Description of the population to be studied.  
The patients for whom the  OPTIMIZER  System is indicated are those with 
reduced ventricular function and symptomatic heart failure.  Subjects entered 
into this investigation will be representative of the patient population with 
stable, moderate to severe heart failure receiving op timal medical therapy that 
are likely to benefit from application of CCM signals.  
G. References to literature and data that are relevant to the trial and that 
provide background for the trial.  
Pacemaker implantation has been well characterized and is the s tandard of care 
for treatment of certain types of cardiac rhythm disorders.  The literature related 
to this therapy is voluminous and readily available.  References specific to CCM 
signal application are listed in Appendix A .  Cardiac resynchronization the rapy 
(CRT) is applicable to heart failure patients with conduction abnormalities 
manifested as an increased QRS duration on the body surface electrocardiogram.  
The clinical studies in which CRT has been evaluated have provided important 
information for ho w to conduct studies of CCM signal application and are 
therefore relevant to the present investigation.

 The details of the Schedule of Events are provided in the Section VI. A.  
Treatments to be administered.  
C. Anticipated Rate of Site and Patient Recruitment  
Four hundred and eighteen  (418) study  participants will be recruited from an 
estimated [ADDRESS_54377] (DSMB)  
An independent DSMB shall be established to review results and adverse events 
in order to provide unbiased oversight of the study.  The DSMB shal l be 
composed of members with clinical trial experience in heart failure, 
electrophysiology and statistics.  The sponsor shall work with the DSMB to 
develop a set of standard operating procedures which shall include the timing 
and format of regularly sched uled meetings, the format in which data shall be 
submitted by [CONTACT_51557].     
E. Event Adjudication Committee (EAC)  
 An EAC shall be establi shed.  The EAC will be responsible for the review, 
adjudication and validation of all reported SAEs that occur over the course of 
the study and the subsequent classification of these complications as related to 
the device or procedure.  The committee shall  also adjudicate the cardiac 
relatedness of deaths and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  The EAC shall be composed of 
independent physicians not otherwise affiliated with the study.  The committee 
will determine a schedule for meeting times based on the expected rate of patient  
accrual.   
F. A description of the measures taken to minimize/avoid bias  
This study has been designed to minimize sources of bias so that clinical device 
performance may be assessed clearly and objectively.  
 
 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54378] 7 , 2014  Page 26 of 52 1. Site selection  
The trial will be a multi -center study, with approximately 50 clinical 
sites located in the [LOCATION_002].  Site selection will be based upon 
investigator and site experience in multi -center studies of heart failure 
treatments, adequate resources and availability of an approp riate patient 
population.  
2. Randomization  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.  
Block randomization by [CONTACT_51558] (ischemic 
versus non -ischemic  cardiomyopathy ) will be used to ensure balanced 
enrollment b etween the two groups.  
3. Objective Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoints of this study are chosen to provide as 
objective as possible assessment of clinical and physiologic 
improvements.  With regard to the physiologic assessment, ventilat ory 
threshold shall be used to assess efficacy.  This parameter is determined 
by a blinded core laboratory and is considered to be independent of bias 
and relatively independent of the placebo effect.   
4. Core Laboratories  
Core laboratories shall be used to analyze results of cardiopulmonary 
exercise test, echocardiograms, NYHA and Holter recordings.  All 
analyses shall be performed blinded to treatment assignment.  Standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) for each of the core laboratories are 
established in c ollaboration between the Sponsor and each core lab 
director.   
5. Subject accountability

cardiac contractility modulating (CCM) electrical signals to the heart 
muscle.  
2. Description of dosage   
CCM signals r esemble pacing signals in that they are characterized by a 
delay, duration and amplitude.  Compared to pacing signals, CCM 
signals are multiphasic, are of wider pulse duration and are higher in 
amplitude.  In this study, the signals will consist of two bip hasic pulses 
~10 ms in duration (total duration ~20 ms) with amplitude of ~ 7.5 V.    
3. Dosage Regimen  
In addition to optimal medical therapy, one group of subjects (Treatment 
Group) shall receive five non -contiguous one -hour periods of CCM 
signal applicat ion per day for the twelve months of the study, with a 
schedule of one hour ON and three hours 48 minutes OFF.     
A second group of subjects will be assigned to the control group and 
shall continue to receive optimal medical therapy (Control Group).    
4. Description of packaging and labeling  
The OPTIMIZER  System hardware will be labeled, packaged and 
shipped in a manner that identifies the System as an investigational 
device for clinical investigation only, and that protects the device under 
normal condi tions of shippi[INVESTIGATOR_51497].  The leads will retain their 
commercial packaging and labeling and will be hand carried or shipped 
in corrugated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_19263].  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54380]’s participation in the main portion of the study is 
expected to be approximately 13 months.  This will include up to one month for 
screening and baseline testing and a one year primary follow -up period.  
Following completion of the main portion of the study, patients with an  
OPTIMIZER™ device shall continue to be followed clinically at approximately 
3 month intervals until the FDA has made a determination about the safety and 
efficacy of the device.  The sequence and duration of trial periods are described 
in Table 1 .

Individual subjects will be discontinued from the study according to 
Section V.C. Subject Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures Specifying.   
2. Entire trial  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the overall 
safety aspects of the study and make recommendations regarding the 
conduct and continuation of the study  as necessary.  DSMB procedures 
will be described in the DSMB charter. No stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_51498] d that will allow the trial to stop early to conclude treatment 
effectiveness.   
J. Accountability procedures for investigational products.  
Clinical investigators will be trained in the importance of accountability of 
investigational products.  Impulse Dyna mics engineers will install any required 
OPTIMIZER  System hardware at the site.  Disposable components of the 
System will be hand carried to the site by [CONTACT_51559].  Impulse

3 Note:  This number is based on the following assumptions:   
1. It is desired to deliver CCM signals for ≥70% of the time;  
2. CCM signals are suppressed for 3 beats following a PV C.  Therefore, if there is one PVC every 13 beats there will be 9 CCM 
signals delivered (no CCM on the PVC and no CCM for 3 additional NSR beats);  
3. If the average HR is 85, there are 115,200 beats/day.   
4. If 1/13 of these are PVCs, that equals an esti mated 8861 beats/24 hours.  The actual percent of CCM signal delivery will depend 
on whether PVCs occur as singlets, doublets, runs, etc.

VI. Treatment of subjec ts 
A. Treatments to be administered  
1. Screening  
Potentially eligible subjects will be informed of the relative risks and 
potential benefits of participating in the study and then asked to sign an 
informed consent document.  A copy of the Informed Consent document 
is loca ted in Appendix B; this document includes a proposed form to 
authorize making information available for the purpose of c linical 
research in compliance with recently enacted patient privacy laws 
(HIPAA Clinical Research Authorization).  It is recognized tha t each 
participating institution shall have their own requirements related to the 
wording of both the informed consent document and the HIPAA form.  
For each subject, medical history, physical examination, NYHA 
classification (including a questionnaire for  NYHA that will be evaluated 
by a blinded core lab) and a history  (past 90 -days) and current usage of 
medication s will be obtained.  
2. Baseline Evaluation and Randomization  
All enrolled subjects will complete a Minnesota Living with Heart 
Failure Questionn aire and undergo an  ECG, echocardiogram (for site 
assessment of LV ejection fraction and end -diastolic dimension), a 
cardiopulmonary stress test (CPX, which shall include assessment of 
VO 2,max, RER, ventilatory threshold  (VT) and ventilatory efficiency 
(equal to VE/VCO 2), a [ADDRESS_54389] (for assessment of the number PVCs).  The [ADDRESS_54390] is eligible for 
participation, a device implantation date shall be scheduled.  The 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54391] shall then be randomized to one of two groups:   
a. Treatment Group, in which case the patient shall undergo device 
implantation on the scheduled implant date.  These subjects shall 
go on to receive CCM treatment for one year as detailed below.   
b. Control Group, in which case the subject will be followed with 
continued medical therapy for one year.  For subjects randomized 
to the Control group who do require an ICD implant based on 
standard clinical  criteria, the ICD implant shall occur on this 
scheduled date.  For patients not requiring an ICD implant, the 
scheduled implant date shall be cancelled . 
3. Study Procedures  
a. Treatment  
i. Control Subjects  
 Subjects randomized to the control group shall continue 
to receive optimal medical therapy and shall be seen 
according to the same follow -up schedule as those in the 
Treatment group.  
ii. Treatment Subjects  
 Subjects randomized to active treatment with CCM will 
undergo implantation of an OPTIMIZER  pulse 
generator and associated leads.  These subjects will be 
prepared for device implantation according to the 
procedure of the institution.  The precordial region of the 
chest (left or right subclavian region) will be prepped and 
draped using sterile techniq ue.  Similarly, an appropriate 
region for arterial access (such as the femoral region) 
shall be prepared and draped for cannulated and 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54392] ~[ADDRESS_54393] required to 
proceed with OPTIMIZER  pulse gener ator implantation 
will be a 5% improvement in dP/dt max.  If, after the first 
CCM signal application, the effect is not 5% or greater, 
the ventricular leads used to deliver the signal will be 
repositioned.   
If the minimum acceptable signal effect cannot be  
achieved after several attempts at optimization, the 
procedure will be terminated.  The device will not be 
implanted  and all OPTIMIZER System leads will be taken  
out.  Where clinically indicated  and planned , these 
subjects shall  undergo implantation of an  ICD and/or dual 
chamber pacemaker .  These subjects will be discharged 
from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51501] ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54394] can be 
achieved, the OPTIMIZER  pulse generator will be 
implanted.  Where indicated, subjects may also undergo 
implantation of an ICD and/or dual chamber pacemaker 
during the same procedure.  Leads which are in place in 
subjects with a prior ICD and/or pacemaker implant will 
continue to be used for those devices, but may not be 
connected to the OPTIMIZER system.   To ensure that the 
OPTIMIZER System does not interfere with proper 
functioning of the ICD and/or pacemaker, these  devices 
shall be interrogated during application of CCM signals.   
The main mechanisms whereby [CONTACT_51563]; this is c alled double counting.   To ensure 
that this is not the case, the ICD/pacemaker should be 
programmed to its non -therapy delivering mode and the 
OPTIMIZER™ System should be activated to deliver 
CCM signals.   The physician then accesses the marker 
channels of  the ICD/pacemaker to check if double 
counting is present.   If so, the physician should modify the 
ICD/pacemaker parameters (e.g., increase the blanking 
period) until double counting is no longer evident.  
b. Predischarge (for subjects randomized to Treatme nt Group)  
When each of the implanted subjects is stable and suitable for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]  (a minimum 12 hour stay is recommended) , he 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54395] X -ray according to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51502].   
If the patient has an implanted pacemaker and/or a defibrillator 
these devices will be activated immediately and remain active.  
The OPTIMIZER™ pulse generator will be activated prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51503].  The subject will  
be observed during this time and device parameters will be 
adjusted as needed.  If the patient has a pacemaker and/or 
defibrillator implanted, the pacemaker and/or defibrillator will be 
interrogated to assure proper functioning.  The OPTIMIZER™ 
will be in terrogated at the end of the activation period to ensure 
proper functioning.  The OPTIMIZER™ will be programmed in a 
“monitor only” mode, which means it will not deliver CCM 
signals, but it will track and record the number of cardiac cycles.  
If patient ha s an implanted pacemaker and/or defibrillator the 
pacemaker/defibrillator will remain active.  At the discretion of 
the Principal Investigator, the subject may be observed for 
additional days of device activation in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51504].  
Prior t o discharge, patients may be introduced to the battery 
charging system and provided a comprehensive overview on the 
use of this equipment.   If not at discharge, this training will at 
least be provided when CCM therapy is turned on ( Week 2 
Follow -up visit ).  
c. Week [ADDRESS_54396] will 
return for follow up.  This visit  shall include an interim medical 
history, a medication review, and a physical examination .  For 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54397] 7 , 2014  Page 38 of 52 patients randomized to the treatment arm the pulse generator will 
be interrogated to confirm proper functioning and parameters 
shall be adjusted as needed.  At this time, the OPTIMIZER 
System shall be activated  (turned ON) .  These subject s will also 
be educated on the use of the OPTIMIZER System charger.  
d. Weeks 4, 12, 24, [ADDRESS_54398], an echocardiogram and a MLWHFQ 
will be obtained in addition to device interrogations.  6 -minute 
walk and CPX may be done on the same day a minimum of 3 
hours apart.  On Weeks 12 and 24, subjects will undergo a H olter 
monitor examination.     
The ICD will be interrogated at 12, 24, 36, and 50 -weeks to 
ascertain proper functioning of the device , in subjects with an 
ICD.   For all subjects, medical regimen for heart failure 
treatment shall remain fixed unless clinic al circumstances dictate 
otherwise; changes in medical regimen shall be elicited and 
recorded during the scheduled follow -up visits.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54399] Study Follow -Up 
Following the 50 week follow up, subjects in the Control group 
shall resume routine follow -up from their primary care providers.  
Subjects in the Treatment group can continue to receive treatment 
with CCM signals.  These patients shall be seen at ~ 6 month 
intervals at the investigational site.  These follow -up visits shall 
include an Optimizer device interrogation and reporting of any 
Optimizer device -related serious adverse events  (and 
corresponding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51505], if any) and all 
deaths .  These visits shall continue until FDA has made a 
determination of device safety and efficacy.  In the event that the 
study is termi nated prior to approval, the device is found to be 
ineffective or at the request of the patient, the device can be 
removed.  Alternatively, the device can be left in place and 
deactivated; in this case, the device charger would be retrieved 
from the patien t in order to eliminate the possibility of further use 
of the device.  
f. Device retrieval in case of subject death  
 In the event that a study participant dies, every attempt will be 
made to secure permission from the family to retrieve the device.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54400] 7 , 2014  Page 40 of 52 In such  cases, the device shall be shipped to the sponsor where it 
shall be inspected and interrogated.  
B. Treatment of Subjects Enrolled in Phase I of this Study  
Phase I of this study was designed as a double blind study in which all subjects 
underwent OPTIMIZER  II System implant and were randomized for 6 months to 
either receive or not receive CCM treatment.  This is then followed by a 6 month 
period of open label CCM treatment.  Fifty patients were enrolled in this phase 
at 10 investigational sites.  Treatment of patients enrolled in Phase I is further 
detailed in Appendix D.  In brief, these patients shall be offered an OPTIMIZER 
III device when the battery of the OPTIMIZER II system becomes depleted.  
C. Medications/treatments permitted (including rescue medica tion) and not 
permitted before and/or during the trial  
Subjects will remain on their initial medication regimens throughout the study, 
unless clinical circumstances dictate a change.  There are no restrictions on the 
types of medications that may be used d uring the trial.  
D. Procedures for monitoring subject compliance  
Clinical monitoring will be performed by/or under the management direction of 
the Impulse Dynamics Clinical Affairs Department.  
 
VII. Assessment of efficacy  
A. Specifications of efficacy para meters  
The primary efficacy parameter  shall be : 
 Change in ventilatory threshold as assessed by [CONTACT_51564] a blinded core lab.  
The secondary efficacy parameters shall include:  
 Change in heart failure class, as assessed by t he [LOCATION_001] Heart 
Association (NYHA) classification . NYHA classification shall be 
assigned by:  
[CONTACT_51565] ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54401] clinical 
practice  
o by a blinded core lab  
 Change in Quality of Life, as assessed by [CONTACT_51566] w ith 
Heart Failure Questionnaire  
 Change in exercise tolerance, as assessed by [CONTACT_51567] -minute walk test  
 Change in left ventricular ejection fraction, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_51568] a blinded core lab  
 Changes in left ventricular end -diastol ic dimension  as assessed by 
[CONTACT_51569] a blinded core lab  
 Changes in  peak oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency as 
assessed by [CONTACT_51570]  
 Comparisons of treatment effects separately in subjects whose CHF 
etiology is isc hemic or non -ischemic  
 Changes in medical treatment for heart failure (either up or down 
titration of doses or changes in the types of medications prescribed).  
 Comparison of the primary and secondary efficacy and safety 
outcome measures in subjects with and  without a pacemaker or ICD.  
 Evaluation of the impact of CCM voltage on primary and secondary 
efficacy and safety outcome measures.  
B. Methods and timing for assessing, recording and analyzing efficacy 
parameters  
The timing of efficacy parameter assessment s, as summarized in Table 1 , will 
be at approximately three -month intervals.  
 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54402] suggested means by 
[CONTACT_51571], it is 
acknowledged that the actual mechanism of action is not known.  This is not atypi[INVESTIGATOR_51506], including devices and pharmacologic 
agents.  As for any new treatment, whether the mechanism is known or unkn own, 
assessment of safety rests on careful ascertainment and documentation of adverse 
effects within the context of a randomized, controlled clinical trial.   
A. Specification of safety parameters  
The safety of the OPTIMIZER™ System will be assessed by [CONTACT_51572] (see section IX.A.2 for statistical 
analysis plan).   The primary safety endpoint  shall  be the proportion of patients 
experiencing a composite  event of all -cause mortality and all -cause 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_54403], 
including death.  Examples of adverse events that could occur as a result of the 
surgical procedure and implantation of the device components are li sted below 
in hierarchical order of clinical severity:  
1. Death   
2. Arrhythmias (tachy - or bradycardias)  
3. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)  
4. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]  
5. RV perforation  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54404] 7 , 2014  Page 43 of 52 6. Bleeding  
7. Infection  
8. Pleural and pericardial effusion  
9. Pneumothorax  
Examples of additional adverse events that could occur as a result of the 
subjects’ underlying disease (i.e., heart failure) or CCM signal application are 
listed below in hierarchical order of clinical severity:  
1. Abnormalities of cardiac fun ction  
2. Worsening of heart failure  
3. Myocar dial tissue damage  
4. Chest pain  
 
B. Serious, Devic e Related and Unanticipated Adverse Event Definitions.  
Adverse events that occur during this study may be associated with the implant 
procedure, or specifically  associated with the use of the device.  An adverse 
event will be considered to be device -related when, in the judgment of the 
Principal Investigator, there is a logical connection between the use of the device 
and the occurrence of the event, above and be yond the study procedure itself.  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that results in 
death, is life -threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51507] , results in persisten t or significant 
disability/incapacity or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  An unanticipated 
adverse device event is defined as any serious adverse effect on the health or 
safety of a subject or any life -threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_51573], which was not listed in the Investigational Plan or 
the labeling for the device.  
A serious device -related adverse event is any serious adverse event (as defined 
above) that is considered definitely related to the Optimizer System.  An adverse 
event will be considered device -related when, in the judgment of the Principal 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54405] 7 , 2014  Page 44 of 52 Investigator, there is a logical connection between the use of the device and the 
occurrence of the event, above and beyond the study procedure itself.  Example s 
include : 
 Optimizer lead failure (dislodgement, fracture) requiring surgical 
revision  
 Optimizer IPG failure requiring surgical revision  
 Optimizer pocket erosion requiring surgical revision  
 Pocket stimulation secondary to CCM, requiring surgical revision  
 
C. Proc edures for recording and reporting adverse events and intercurrent 
illnesses.  
The Investigator shall report all adverse events to Impulse Dynamics and to the 
reviewing IRB (according to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361]).  All device malfunctions and 
serious adverse events,  including, but not limited to events associated with 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and/or a new hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51508] [ADDRESS_54406] (during the 1 year study only) and to the FDA as required.  
D. Type and duration of follow -up of subjects after adverse events.  
All subjects experiencing serious adverse events will be followed as r equired by 
[CONTACT_51574].  Impulse Dynamics will investigate any anticipated or 
unanticipated serious adverse effect or subject death.  If it is determined that the 
adverse event could present an unreasonable risk to other subjects, all 
investigations or  parts of investigations presenting that risk will be terminated.  
Investigation of the event and notification of study termination will occur within 
five working days after notice of the effect is received at Impulse Dynamics.  
The terminated investigatio n will not be resumed without IRB approval.  
 
IX. Statistic al Considerations  
A. Description of the statistical methods to be employed  
1. Primary efficacy analysis  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54407] 7 , 2014  Page 45 of 52 The primary efficacy analysis will compare responder rates between the 
Treatment and Control g roups at the 6 -month follow -up visit.  The 
primary outcome measure will be:  
 change from baseline in the ventilatory threshold (VT) 
determined on cardiopulmonary stress testing  
Individual patient response will be defined as an increase of ≥ 1 ml 
O2/kg/min  in VT at 6 months as compared with baseline.  Responder 
rates will be calculated and compared between the treatment and control 
groups based on both the intent -to-treat population and the per -protocol 
population using a one -sided binomial comparison with an alpha of 
0.025.  
The statistical hypothesis to be tested is:  
 
H0: πc > πt  vs. HA: πc < πt 
 
Where πc is the proportion of patients in the control group that have > 1 
ml O 2/kg/min improvement in VT at [ADDRESS_54408] > 1 ml O 2/kg/min 
improvement in VT at 6 months from baseline.  
 
2. Primary Safety Analysis  
 The primary safety analysis shall evaluate the composite event rate of all 
cause mortality and all cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n at 12 months.  The 
statistical hypothesis shall be that the p roportion  of patients in the 
treatment group where an event occurs by  12 month s will be non-inferior 
to the p roportion  of patients where an event occurs by [CONTACT_941] 12 month  visit 
in the control group.  
The s tatistical hypothes is to be tested shall be : 
t > c +  
vs. 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54409] 7 , 2014  Page 46 of 52 t < c + 
where =0.125 (clinically insignificant difference)  and c is the event rate 
in the control group and the t is the event rate in the treatment group.  
 The statistical test to be used shall be the Blackwelder non -inferio rity test  
and will be evaluated based on the  intent -to-treat patient population and 
the per protocol patient population .  Censoring is expected to be 
minimal, but in order to determine if there are different patterns of 
mortality between groups, Kaplan -Meier curves will also be constructed, 
with Log -rank tests used to determine statistical significance between 
groups.   
 
The nature, frequency,  and seriousness  of adverse events between the 
two groups shall be compared using descriptive  summary statistics.    
 
3. Justification of sample size  
Results of prior studies of CCM and biventricular pacing in which VT 
has been employed as an endpoint provide estimates for standard 
deviations of changes and standard deviations of absolute values that 
may be observed in th e present study.   
For the safety endpoint, the composite event rate of all cause mortality 
and all cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n at 12 months  shall be used. Based on prior 
studies with cardiac resynchronization therapy and preliminary 
experience with CCM, if we a ssume a total event rate (mortality or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10088]) of 50% (a conservative estimate for sample 
size purposes), an alpha of .05, 80% power and a delta of 12.5%, [ADDRESS_54410] any 
dropouts (i.e., we expect to be able to account for mortality and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51509]); however, adjusting for a 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54411] 7 , 2014  Page 47 of 52 potential 5% loss to follow -up results in a total sampl e size of 418 
patients (209 per treatment group).  
 
For the efficacy endpoint, the response rate based on a ≥  1 ml  
O2/kg/min increase in VT at [ADDRESS_54412] results and based on prior studies of heart 
failure, including those on CRT (e.g., the MIR ACLE study, Abraham et 
al, N Engl J Med 2002;346:1845 -53 and the Medtronic InSync 
Biventricular Pacing System’s Summary of Safety and Effectiveness 
P010015) it is also expected that a certain number of control patients will 
meet the success criterion.  It is estimated that that a reasonable estimate 
of the responder rate would be ~20% in the control group based on a 
preliminary analysis of limited clinical data collected in Europe and prior 
studies of heart failure.  We expect to observe a relatively large 
difference ( e.g., 30% or larger) between groups.  In this case, the sample 
size shall be determined based on the safety analysis.  Even after 
allowing for a 5% lost to follow -up for efficacy purposes ( i.e., which 
would result in 198 evaluable patients) thi s sample size would provide 
sufficient power to detect a 1 3% or greater difference in responder rates 
between groups if a 20% responder rate was observed.   
 
Thus, in order to have adequate power for all study endpoints, the study 
will enroll 209 patients per treatment group.  
 
4.  Secondary efficacy analyses  
                                                           
4 A difference in VT of 1 ml O 2/kg/min is justified as being clinically significant based on prior studies of card iac 
resynchronization therapy showing that there is an approximately 1 ml O2/kg/min change in response to that 
approved therapy (Auricchio et al.  J Am Coll Cardiol 2003;42:2109 -16) 
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54413] 7 , 2014  Page 48 of 52 The secondary analyses will include:  
a. Comparison between groups of the change from baseline in New 
York Heart Association (NYHA) classification.  NYHA 
classification shall be assigned by:   
i. blinded on site clinicians according to their standard clinical 
practice  
ii. by a blinded core lab that evaluates patient responses to a 
standardized questionnaire.5   
b. Comparison between groups of the changes from baseline in 
quality of life, as assessed by [CONTACT_3433] e Minnesota Living with Heart 
Failure (MLWHF) Questionnaire.   
c. Comparison between groups of the change from baseline in 
exercise tolerance, as quantified by [CONTACT_51575] 
(6MW).   
d. Comparison between groups of the change from baseline in left 
ventricular ejection fraction as assessed by [CONTACT_51553] a 
blinded core lab.  
e. Comparison between groups of the change from baseline in  left 
ventricular size as indexed by [CONTACT_51576]-diastolic dimension determined  by a blinded core lab.  
f. Comparison between groups of the change from baseline in  peak 
VO 2 and ventilatory efficiency determined on CPX testing.  
g Comparisons of treatment effects separately in subjects whose 
CHF etiology is ischemic or non-ischemic  
h. Comparison between groups of the change from baseline in  
medical treatment for heart failure (either up or down titration of 
doses or changes in the types of medications prescribed).  
                                                           
[ADDRESS_54414] Fail  10: 228 -235, 2004.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54415] to baseline evaluations (including NYHA Class, peak 
VO2, MLWHFQ, initial medications and additional implanted devices).  
If any significant differences are observed in the aforementioned baseline 
factors or other cov ariates, all primary and secondary analyses will be 
repeated with an adjustment for the significant factors.  
 
 Additionally, an exploratory comparison for treatment effects across sites 
will be performed along with a statistical comparison using a chi -squared 
test for homogeneity.  
 
B. Number of subjects planned to be enrolled  
Based upon the power calculations in Section IX.A.3  above, 418 subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_54416] completed 
the Week 50 follow -up.  Patients with an implant who choose to continue CCM 
therapy shall continue to be followed every six months until FDA  has completed 
their review of this study.  
D. Procedure for accounting for missing, unused and spurious data.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54417] the endpoints on all subjects a t all follow -
up points, but especially at Week 24 (the primary efficacy endpoint assessment) 
and 50 weeks (the primary safety endpoint assessment).  An intent -to-treat 
analysis will be performed on the primary efficacy and safety endpoints and will 
include  all patients randomized, regardless of whether patients withdrew prior to 
study completion.  The main reasons for withdrawal are anticipated to be failure 
to reach ≥  5% improvement in dP/dtmax during the system implant procedure 
(for patients randomized t o treatment) and voluntary decision by [CONTACT_102] (for 
patients randomized to control).  Imputation of missing data will include a 
conservative scenario and missingness patterns will be compared across 
treatment groups.  Where missing data are present, a worst case analysis (control 
subjects assumed to satisfy success criteria and treatment subjects assumed to 
fail success criteria) shall also be performed for the primary safety and efficacy 
analyses.  
E. Procedures for reporting deviations from the origina l statistical plan.  
Deviations from the original statistical plan will be reported at the time that the 
statistical report is issued.  
F. Selection of subjects to be included in the analyses.  
All subjects will be accounted for in the analyses (See Section 9 .E.). 
 
X. Direct access to source/data documents  
The investigators and institutions will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB 
review, and regulatory inspections, providing direct access to source/data documents.  
 
XI. Quality control and quality ass urance  
Quality control and quality assurance will be the responsibility of the Impulse Dynamics 
clinical representatives.  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54418] demonstrated the safety of the OPTIMIZER  System with 
commercially available active fixation leads and the performance of  the CCM signal in 
improving ventricular function.  Results of preliminary clinical studies suggest that brief 
applications of CCM signals do not pose an unreasonable risk to heart failure subjects.  
The present study represents the next step in the evalua tion of this device.  The study is 
justifiable because the potential benefits of using the device outweigh the risks to 
participating subjects.  
Prior to the initiation of the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_51510] a copy of th e Patient Informed Consent document that has been 
approved by [CONTACT_51577].  Before enrollment, each subject will be 
informed of the overall requirements and potential risks and benefits of the study and 
his/her written consent will be obtained.  
 
XIII.  Data handling and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_51511] (EDC) by 
[CONTACT_51578]. Access to clinical study 
information will be based on i ndividuals’ roles and responsibilities and will be 
controlled by [CONTACT_51579]. The 
application provides hierarchical user permission data entry, viewing, and reporting 
options. For optimum security, the system o perates Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128 -bit 
encryption protocol over Virtual Private Networks. This application is designed to be in

Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of the  
OPTIMIZER  System with Active Fixation Leads in  
Subjects with Heart Failure Resulting from Systolic Dysfunction:  
FIX-HF-5 
 
INFORMED CONSENT  
 
Introduction  
Your doctor has explained to you that your heart strength is decreased and this may be causing 
you to experience tiredness and shortness of breath.  This condition, called heart failure,  is 
usually treated with medi cations to improve the strength of the heart muscle and reduce the 
amount of work the heart has to do.  However, medications are not always successful in making 
heart failure patients feel better.  A new experimental medical device has been developed to 
improve heart strength using electrical signals applied to the heart.  The experimental medical 
device is called the OPTIMIZER  System.  The experimental treatment delivered by [CONTACT_51593]™ System for stimulating the heart muscle with an electrical signal is called cardiac 
contractility modulation (CCM) treatment.  
 
Research  
You are being asked to consider voluntary participation in a research study of the CCM treatment 
with the OPTIMIZER™ System sponsored by [CONTACT_51594] ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  The purpose 
of the study is to determine whether the CCM treatment improves the way you feel.  We would 
like to give you all the information necessary to help you make an informed decision about 
participating in this research study.  Before you give your consent please read the following 
information carefully.

review of this study. This follow up may take up to 5 years.   
 
Study Procedures  
Certain medical tests will be performed to determine if you are eligible to participate in this 
study. These tests include a physical examination with a medical history; an electrocardiogram 
(to check the electrical activity in your heart); two different types of stress tests (one test 
performed on a treadmill while the oxygen in your breath is analyzed and a second test to see 
how far you can walk on flat ground), an echocardiogram (to check the strength of your heart), 
two questionnaires that ask you about your heart failure symptoms and a [ADDRESS_54448] (a tape r ecording of your heart rhythm over the course of an entire day).  If you are a woman 
of childbearing potential, a preg nancy test will be done within 7 days of scheduled implant to 
make sure that you are not pregnant; in addition, you must agree not to beco me pregnant as long 
as you are in this study.  Women of childbearing potential must be using a medically approved 
method of birth control such as an IUD, surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation), or 
must be post -menopausal for at least one yea r.  
If the results of these tests indicate that you are eligible to participate, you will be randomly 
assigned (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to one of two groups: either a group that receives an OPTIMIZER 
System or a group that does not receive the OPTIMIZER Syst em.  Regardless of which group 
you are in, you will continue to be followed closely to ensure that you are receiving optimal 
medical therapy for your heart failure.

through a small incision in an artery in your groin.  This catheter will be used to measure the 
effects of CCM treatment on your heart.  If the effects of the CCM treatment do not reach a 
certain level the OPTIMIZER System will not be implanted . If the effect do es reach a certain 
level, the OPTIMIZER System will be implanted.  The implant includes three electrical wires 
(leads) that connec t the device to your heart through the veins inside your chest, very similar to 
procedures used when implanting a pacemaker device.  The leads are used to record the normal 
electrical signals generated by [CONTACT_51595].  The 
implantation is performed under sterile conditions with local anesthesia while you are awake, but 
possibly sedated.  The implantation will be done either in an operating room or in a cardiac 
catheterization laboratory, depending upon the norma l practices for implanting heart devices at 
your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Many patients with heart failure develop a need for a device called an implantable cardiac 
defibrillator (ICD) and/or a pacemaker.  If you do not already have one of these devices, your 
doctor may  recommend that one be implanted.  If you are randomized to receive the 
OPTIMIZER System, the devices can be implanted at the same time.  If you do have both 
devices, your doctor will perform tests to make sure that the devices do not interfere with each 
other.  This could include a standard test used to confirm proper ICD function during which your 
heart is stimulated to beat abnormally (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation).    
Following a device implant you will have a chest X -ray before you are sent h ome.  The 
OPTIMIZER System will be turned on for a brief period to make sure it is operating properly.  
During this time, you may also be instructed in how to use the battery charger.  Before you leave 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], however, the OPTIMIZER System will be tu rned to sensing mode until your next 
visit to the doctor.

A physical examination and check of your medications will be performed.  In subjects that have a 
pacemaker and/or ICD, that device will also be tested to make sure it is working properly.  If you 
have received an OPTIMIZER implant, the device will be checked to make sure it is worki ng 
properly and will be adjusted if necessary.  The OPTIMIZER System will be turned ON to 
deliver the CCM treatment, which you will receive for the next [ADDRESS_54451] during your daily life, to undergo stress tests to see how

for you.  In such case,  a medical history , medication revi ew, physical examination and device 
interrogation will be performed at 3 -month intervals until the FDA has completed its review of

3. Risks Assoc iated with the Use of Local Anesthesia  
Risks associated with the use of local anesthesia used during the OPTIMIZER System 
implantation procedure are as follows:  
 puncture of a vein  
 localized pain at or around injection site  
 numbness at or around injection s ite 
 bruising  
4. Risks associated with possible ICD and/or pacemaker device interactions  
If you have an ICD, it is possible that the CCM pulses delivered by [CONTACT_51596] a fast heart beat (ventricul ar 
tachycardia).  If this should happen, the ICD may send an unnecessary shock to your heart.  
Studies in animals have not found this to be a problem when the ICD and the OPTIMIZER 
System are programmed correctly.  Also, it cannot be excluded that the Opti mizer III will 
cause the ICD to fail to deliver treatment for a life threatening arrhythmia. However, the 
Optimizer device is designed to minimize  this possibility and prior testing and experience in 
patients confirm the unlikeliness of this occurring. Additionally, all personnel involved with 
programming the OPTIMIZER System have been trained on device programming and device 
interaction testing.  
If you have a cardiac pacemaker it is possible that the CCM pulses delivered by [CONTACT_51597] a regular 
heart beat.  If this should happen, the pacemaker might not send pacing signals to your heart 
at a rate needed by [CONTACT_39625], and could result in an abnormally slow or unsteady heart 
rhythm (bradyca rdia).  Symptoms of bradycardia result from a lack of oxygen enriched blood 
being delivered to your body and include dizziness, fainting, extreme fatigue and shortness of 
breath.   
Many of the risks associated with the implantation  of the OPTIMIZER System are minimized 
by [CONTACT_51598], through 
the use of meticulous care during the implantation  procedure and by [CONTACT_51599].

5. Risk of an Optimizer System Surgical Revision  
There is a potential that any system component could malfunction, become damaged, 
infected, or, in the case of the leads, become dislodged.  System component malfunction or 
other clinical circumstances (e.g., s epsis) may require noninvasive corrective actions or 
possibly even a surgical revision (repositioning, replacement, or removal) of the 
malfunctioning component(s).   
6. Unknown Risks  
Because the OPTIMZER System is an experimental device, the application of CC M 
treatment to your heart may involve risks that are currently unknown.  If you receive the 
OPTIMIZER System, you will be notified of any additional risks that become known during 
the study that may affect your decision of whether to continue in the study.  
 
Foreseeable Risks Associated with Study Participation for All Study Patients  
There is a risk for all patients enrolled in this study, whether you receive an OPTIMIZER System 
or not, that your heart failure signs and symptoms may become worse.  Heart fail ure signs and 
symptoms include:  
 Stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA)  
 heart attack  
 dizziness or lightheadedness  
 palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]  
 increased fatigue/weakness  
 shortness of breath or difficulty  breathing  
 fluid retention in the lungs  
 severe swelling of the le gs, feet and ankles  
 abnormal heart rhythms (too fast or too slow)  
There is also a risk of death associated with many of the signs and symptoms listed above.

TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS ENROLLED IN PHASE I OF THE FIX -HF-5 STUDY  
 
Background  
On May 6, 2004, FDA conditionally approved the Evaluation of the Safet y and Efficacy of 
the OPTIMIZER™ II System with Active Fixation Leads in Subjects with Heart Failure 
Resulting from Systolic Dysfunction: FIX -HF-5.  The evaluation was designed as a 
prospective, double -blind, multi -center study of subjects with moderate to  severe heart 
failure.  An interim safety evaluation was planned after completion of the first 50 implants 
(Phase I), with a DSMB decision required before proceeding with additional patient 
enrollment (Phase II).  All Phase I patients received an OPTIMIZER ™ II System and were 
randomized to either have the device either turned “ON” or “OFF” for the first six months of 
follow -up.  Patients were informed that if their device was turned “ON” for the first six 
months, the battery would deplete and the device wou ld need to be replaced.  If their device 
was turned “OFF” for the first six months, it would be turned “ON” after they completed the 
first six months of follow -up.   
 
Changes are now proposed to the study design and to the device.  The new generation of th e 
device, the OPTIMIZER™ III System is now being introduced; this device has a rechargeable 
battery meaning that it does not have to be replaced after every 6 month period.  Because of 
this, however, the study design is now extending to two groups (treatme nt versus control) that 
are followed for twelve (12) instead of six (6) months.  The study will transition into an un -
blinded safety and effectiveness evaluation of patients who will either receive or not receive 
the OPTIMIZER™ III System.  This appendix i s intended for those centers that enrolled 
patients into Phase I of the IDE study, and describes the methods used for the ongoing 
evaluation of those subjects.  
 
The sequence and duration of these follow -up intervals are described in Table 1 .

Version: August 7, 2014   Page 2 of 4 Study Proce dures  
The main changes to the original protocol (May 6, 2004) in which 50 Phase I study subjects 
are participating shall be:  
1. At the point of OPTIMIZER II battery depletion, all subjects shall be offered the 
opportunity to have a device replacement with an OPTIMIZER™ III pulse generator 
as a replacement device.  For subjects randomized to “ON” during the first [ADDRESS_54462] 6 months of 
the study.  For subjects randomized to “OFF” during the first [ADDRESS_54463] (CPX), an echocardiogram and a [ADDRESS_54464] (6MW) at the [ADDRESS_54465] participation shall not change from the originally 
indicated 13 months (including the screening, baseline, and 12 months of follow -up).  
However, subjects who choose to have an OPTIMIZER™ III pulse generator implant 
shall be asked to return for routine follow -up and generator checks at [ADDRESS_54466] and choose to 
keep it a ctive until the FDA completes their review of this study.  
The subjects enrolled in Phase I of the study shall be informed of the changes to the protocol 
since they originally agreed to participate and shall be asked to sign an informed consent 
document tha t describes the risks and potential benefits of the changes.  The risks include 
those associated with performing the additional tests described above (CPX, 6MW and an 
echocardiogram).  The risks associated with these test are considered to be minimal and 
clinically acceptable, as detailed in the original study.  Participation shall be voluntary.  Any 
subject not wishing to participate is free to withdraw from the study.

The OPTIMIZER II pulse generator will be repl aced with the OPTIMIZER™ III rechargeable 
pulse generator, which is connected to the three leads placed during the initial implant 
procedure.  The device replacement procedure is performed under sterile technique.  Device 
interaction (if the patient has an  ICD) and function is checked and a chest X -ray taken 
according to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51523].  Patients may be instructed on when 
and how to use the battery charger and will be discharged with the device turned on.    
Patients will be aske d to return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51524] a 
physical examination, a medication check, and device interrogation.  Additional instruction 
on use of the battery charger will be provided as necessary.      
 
Post Study Follow -Up 
Following the 50 week follow up, subjects can continue to receive treatment with CCM 
signals.  These patients shall be seen at ~ 6 month intervals at the investigational site.  These 
follow -up visits shall include an Optimizer device interrogation and reportin g of any 
Optimizer device -related serious adverse events  (and the corresponding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51525], if any) and all deaths.  These visits shall continue until FDA has made a 
determination of device safety and efficacy.  In the event that the s tudy is terminated prior to 
approval, the device is found to be ineffective or at the request of the patient, the device can 
be removed.  Alternatively, the device can be left in place and deactivated; in this case, the 
device charger would be retrieved fr om the patient in order to eliminate the possibility of 
further use of the device.

INFORMED CONSENT  
 
Introduction  
Several months ago you signed an informed  consent document and were enrolled in a research 
study for the OPTIMIZER™ II System (an experimental medical device).  The OPTIMIZER™ II 
System battery has now depleted and in order to continue CCM treatment, the portion of the 
device that contains the ba ttery needs to be replaced.    
You are now being asked to consider continuing your voluntary participation in this research 
study, which is being sponsored by a company called IMPULSE DYNAMICS ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.  
Please read the following information carefully an d discuss any questions you have with your 
doctor.   
 
Expected Duration of Study Participation  
Your participation in this study is expected to be an additional 6 months (for those subject 
randomized to have CCM treatment ON for the first six months of the study), with additional 
follow -up every [ADDRESS_54472] and choose to keep it active 
until the FDA completes their review of this study.  This follow up may take up to 5 years.

 Study Procedures  
The battery in the OPT IMIZER™ II System that you had implanted several months ago has now 
depleted.  The study sponsor has modif ied that version of the device to one that is now 
rechargeable, called the OPTIMIZER™ III System.  The replacement device (OPTIMIZER™ III) 
will be con nected to the three electrical wires (leads) that were already implanted in your heart 
when you received the OPTIMIZER™ II System.  The device replacement procedure is 
performed under sterile conditions with local anesthesia while you are awake.  The impla ntation 
will be done either in an operating room or in a cardiac catheterization laboratory, depending 
upon the normal practices for implanting heart devices at your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
After the OPTIMIZER™ III device is implanted, your doctor will perform tests to  make sure that 
it is functioning properly.  If you have an ICD (defibrillator) and/or pacemaker in your heart, your 
doctor will also do a test to verify that the devices are not interfere with each other’s function.  
You will have a chest X -ray taken to v erify that the leads in your heart are still optimally placed.  
Before you leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the OPTIMIZER III System will be turned on to deliver the CCM 
treatment, which you will receive for as long as you choose to keep the device charged. You will 
be instructed on how to use the battery charger, which you will take home with you.  The 
OPTIMIZER III System has a rechargable battery, meaning that it can remain active for many 
years without having to be replaced.  During normal use, the battery needs to be recharged every 
week for approximately [ADDRESS_54473] a pacemaker and/or ICD, that 
device as well as the OPTIMIZER III System will be tested to make sure they are working 
properly and adjusted if necessary.     
If you have not done so already, you will be asked to return for follow -up visits at Weeks 36 and 
50 following the date of your initial OPTIMIZER II System implant.  During these two visits you 
will undergo medication review, medical history, physical examination and device

Phase I, August 7, [ADDRESS_54474] during your daily life, to undergo stress tests to see how much you can 
exercise (the [ADDRESS_54475]) and to undergo an 
echocardiogram to check th e strength of your heart.    
At the end of one year (~50 weeks) or after receiving the OPTIMIZER III System (whichever 
comes last), you will have the option of continuing to receive CCM treatment if you and your 
doctor believe that it’s the best choice for  you.  In such case, you will continue to be followed at 
approximately [ADDRESS_54476] em and CCM Treatment  
The risks associated with replacement of the OPTIMIZER System and application of CCM 
treatment include:  
 bleeding  
 pain at the incision site  
 infection  
2.   Risks Associated with the OPTIMIZER System Implant and CCM Treatment  
The risks as sociated with implantation of the OPTIMIZER System (which includes 
implantation of the pulse generator and the leads that connect the generator to your heart) and 
application of CCM treatment include:  
 injury to the heart or blood vessels  
 bleeding  
 irregular  heartbeats (arrhythmias, including abnormally slow or fast heart beats)  
 damage to the heart muscle  
 damage to specialized tissue in the heart responsible for initiating each heart beat (i.e., 
the heart’s c onduction system ) 
 formation of blood clots  
 stroke  
 chest wall sensations  
 pain at the incision site  
 infection  
 collapsed lung  
Impulse Dynamics ([LOCATION_003]), Inc.

Informed Consent Form Addendum  
Phase I, August 7, 2014   Page 4 of 8 
 
  perforation of the leads through the heart wall  
 lead dislodgement  
 fluid or blood accumulation around the heart  
 death  
 
3.   Risks Associated with the Use of Local Anesthesia  
Risks assoc iated with the use of local anesthesia used during the OPTIMIZER System 
replacement procedure are as follows:  
 puncture of a vein  
 localized pain at or around injection site  
 numbness at or around injection site  
 bruising  
4.   Risks associated with ICD/pacemak er device interaction  
If you have an ICD, it is possible that the CCM pulses delivered by [CONTACT_51596] a fast heart beat (ventricular 
tachycardia).  If this should happen, the ICD may send an un necessary shock to your heart.  
Studies conducted in animals indicate that this should not occur when the appropriate type of 
ICD lead is used and when the ICD and the OPTIMIZER System are programmed correctly.   
If you have a pacemaker that is set for pac ing your heart beat, it is possible that the CCM 
pulses delivered by [CONTACT_51604] a regular heart beat.  If this should happen, the pacemaker might not send 
pacing signals to your heart at  a rate needed by [CONTACT_39625], and could result in an abnormally 
slow or unsteady heart rhythm (bradycardia).  Symptoms of bradycardia result from a lack of 
oxygen enriched blood being delivered to your body and include dizziness, fainting, extreme 
fatigue a nd shortness of breath.   
Many of the risks associated with the replacement of the OPTIMIZER System are minimized 
by [CONTACT_51598], through 
the use of meticulous care during the replacement pro cedure and by [CONTACT_51599].  Also, it cannot be excluded 
that the Optimizer III will cause the ICD to fail to deliver treatment for a life threatening 
arrhythmia. However, the Optimizer dev ice is designed to eliminate this possibility and prior

programming and de vice interaction testing.  
5.   Risks Associated with Heart Failure  
There is a risk for all patients enrolled in this study that your heart failure signs and 
symptoms may become worse.  Heart failure signs and symptoms include:  
 stroke  
 heart attack  
 dizzines s or lightheadedness  
 palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]  
 increased fatigue/weakness  
 shortness of breath or difficulty  breathing  
 fluid retention in the lungs  
 severe swelling of the legs, feet and ankles  
 abnormal heart rhythms (too fast or too slow)  
There is also a risk of death a ssociated with many of the signs and symptoms listed above.  
 
6. Risk of an Optimizer System Surgical Revision  
There is a potential that any system component could malfunction, become damaged, 
infected, or, in the case of the leads, become dislodged.  System  component malfunction or 
other clinical circumstances (e.g., sepsis) may require noninvasive corrective actions or 
possibly even a surgical revision (repositioning, replacement, or removal) of the 
malfunctioning component(s).   
7.   Unknown Risks  
Because the OPTIMZER System is an experimental device, the application of CCM 
treatment to your heart may involve risks that are currently unknown.  You will be notified of 
any additional risks that become known during the study that may affect your decision of 
whether to continue in the study.

Reasonably Expected Benefits to You and to Others  
Your heart failure symptoms may improve as a result of receiving CCM treatment and this may 
help you exercise more or feel better.  The study will determine the degree to wh ich these 
benefits occur.  However, because the therapy is not yet proven to be effective, you may not 
benefit from this study.  
 
Alternative Procedures or Treatments  
As a participant in this study, your doctor is making sure that you are receiving the bes t possible 
medications for treating heart failure.  Your doctor may discuss other treatment options, such as 
giving you a drug continuously into a vein to increase the strength of your heart (known as 
positive inotropic agents) or cardiac resynchronization  therapy (another pacemaker like device 
for treating heart failure pati ents with certain types of cardiac conduction abnormalities).  
Therefore, the alternative to continuing your participation in this study is to choose not 
participate (and not to receive  a replacement OPTIMIZER System) and continue with your 
current medications or consider one of the other treatments mentioned above.   
 
Confidentiality  
For the purpose of this study, your health data will be recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_51605] y (Impulse Dynamics) and by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for 
evaluation.  Representatives of the sponsor and the US FDA will inspect your health data.  Any 
data that may be published in scientific journals will not reveal the identity of the s tudy 
participants. Any information that is obtained in connection with this study that can be identified 
with you will remain confidential.

Study #IDPT [ADDRESS_54481] a concomitant device (e.g., ICD, pacemaker) will undergo additional testing 
at the end of the implant procedure to ensure appropriate function of both the Optimizer III and 
the concomitant device. The following steps summarize the required testing:  
1. Program the sensing windows of the Optimizer and ensure that the Optimizer  III can be 
programmed to consistently delivery CCM therapy in the presence of the concomitant 
device.  
2. Activate CCM therapy and evaluate the real -time intracardiac electrograms and marker 
channels to ensure that CCM therapy does not cause inappropriate oversensing  during 
normal sinus rhythm that cannot be resolved through reprogramming or lead 
repositioning.  
3. Activate CCM therapy and evaluate the real -time intracardiac electrograms a nd marker 
channels to ensure that CCM therapy does not cause inappropriate undersensing  during 
normal sinus rhythm that cannot be resolved through reprogramming or lead 
repositioning.  
4. While CCM therapy is being delivered, ensure that CCM therapy does not c ause 
inappropriate inhibition of bradycardia pacing. In patients that require bradycardia pacing, 
activate CCM therapy during pacing and evaluate the real -time intracardiac electrograms 
and marker channels to ensure that CCM therapy does not cause inapprop riate inhibition 
of bradycardia pacing therapy that cannot be resolved through reprogramming or lead 
repositioning.  
5. Program the ICD to detect and convert an induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Program 
the Optimizer III to deliver continuous CCM therapy. W hile CCM therapy is being 
delivered, induce VT/VF and ensure that the implanted ICD can appropriately detect the 
ventricular tachyarrhythmia.  Ensure that CCM therapy does not cause inappropriate 
undersensing during VT/VF that cannot be resolved through re programming or lead

OPTIMIZER III Long -term Follow -up  
 
Background  
The FIX-HF-5 study included a Phase I  and Phase II, with all active study subjects currently 
implanted with the OPTIMIZER™ II I System.  This appendix is intended  for those centers that 
enrolled patients into the FIX -HF-[ADDRESS_54483] acement  
Another protocol called the FIX -HF-5C Confirmatory Study protocol is being conducted under 
the same IDE as the FIX -HF-5 Study.  Subjects in the FIX -HF-5C Study will receive the new 
generation device, the OPTIMIZER™ IVs System. The OPTIMIZER IVs is  very similar in its 
design to the OPTIMIZER III System with regard to its intended use, safety, performance, and 
design characteristics. The Optimizer IVs System employs the same atrial and ventricular leads 
as Optimizer III System.  The purpose of the OP TIMIZER IVs is to offer patients a smaller and 
thinner IPG with a smaller and more portable charger . The OPTIMIZER II I IPG is no longer 
being manufactured by [CONTACT_51565], so if IPG replacement becomes necessary, subjects 
will be provided the OPTIMIZER  IVs System at that time.   Subjects who do not wish to have 
the newer OPTIMIZER IVs implanted will have the OPTIMIZER III IPG de -activated and if 
they wish, the device may be  explanted.

I. I ntr oduction  
 
Moderate to severe heart failure is associated with disability that significantly limits 
exercise tolerance and is associated with poor quality of life.  The OPTIMIZER 
System delivers cardiac contractility modulation, non -excitatory signals during the 
myocardial absolute refractory period synchronized with locally sensed electrical activity, intended to improve symptoms in treated subjects. 
 
The statistical analysis below provides a detailed description of the analyses 
conducted, hypotheses tested, the precise statistical methods used and the populations analyzed.  The analysis methods provide a thorough evaluation of the OPTIMIZER System in the population of moderate to severe heart failure subjects. 
 
II. S tudy D esi gn  
 
This is a multicenter, randomized, prospective, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of the OPTIMIZER
TM System with active fixation leads in 
subjects with moderate to severe heart failure.  Four hundred and twenty eight (428) 
subjects from 50 centers in the US were randomized with equal probability to 
implantation of the OPTIMIZERTM System in combination with optimal medical 
treatment (OMT) for heart failure or to OMT alone. Randomization used permuted blocks of four and was stratified by [CONTACT_51611] (ischemic versus non- ischemic cardiomyopathy). The nature of the treatment and requirement 
for one-year follow up precluded blinding of subjects and their treating clinicians, however, safety data were adjudicated by [CONTACT_51612]- specified criteria.

The baseline exercise capacity appears to be balanced between the treatment groups.  
 
The data from all study sites will be pooled based on a clinical justification of pooling given in Meinert (1986).  The pooling is based on three principles: that all sites used the same protocol, that the sponsor monitored the sites for protocol compliance and that the data gathering in struments (case report forms) were the same at all sites.

A comparison of the baseline characteristics by [CONTACT_51617].  Study sites were combined (to create pseudo 
sites) to allow a study site comparability assessment because a number of sites 
enrolled too few patients for analysis  on their own.  The method of forming pseudo-
sites combines sites in numerical order in such a way to provide as much balance between treated and control patients with in the pseudo site as possible.  This process 
occasionally requires skippi[INVESTIGATOR_51528] a better balance in the randomized patients between the two groups.  The skipped site was combined with one or more sites below it that also provide a good balance for the randomized assignments to the control and Optimizer groups.  The pseudo- sites and the original 
sites used to obtain the pseudo- site are presented below.

1A comparison of exercise duration between patients with missing and non -missing 24 week AT data 
indicated that subjects missing 24 week data with short baseline exercise times (<6.5 minutes) were possibly not miss ing at random.  Assigning these patients worst case values and removing them from 
the missing patient comparison resulted in no statistically significant differences between the patients 
with missing and non -missing 24 week AT values demonstrating that there is no violation in the 
missing at random assumption.

Where s is the root mean square from the regression (an estimate of the 
standard deviation of the AT value), a is the intercept, b 1is the coefficient for  
PVO2 and b 2 is the coefficient for RER .  The equation for case three is similar 
with the difference that the AT term being estimated and the PVO2 and RER 
values are differences between 24 weeks and baseline.  
 b. Propensity Score Imputation ( Imputation Cases 4 and 5)  
 
The patients who had both PVO2 and AT  at 24 week missing were assigned to 
Imputation Case 4.  In addition to the one patient missing AT  at baseline, and 
PVO2 and AT  at 24 weeks, one patient missing PVO2 and AT  at baseline and 
PVO2 at 24 weeks and a second patient missing PVO2 and AT  at baseline 
were added to Imputation Case 5.  Because there were only three patients in Case 5, these were added to Case 4 for propensity score assignment and subsequent imputation.  The random selection based on the propensity score quintile replaced only the missing values for any patient.  For the purposes of

The random selection was done from quintiles of patients with actual non-missing data based on propensity scores and the numbers of missing, assumed non-missing (patients  not in Case 4 or 5) and actual non- missing patients (the 
subset of patients not in Cases 4 or 5 with non- missing data) are presented in 
the table below.

complete data from which the patients with missing data can obtain values in 
each quintile.  The random selection is done with replacement.

X. Primary Safety Analysis  
 
The primary safety analysis evaluated the composite event rate of all cause mortality 
and all cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51530] 50 week s.  The statistical hypothesis is that the 
proportion of subjects in the treatment group where an event occurs by [CONTACT_941] 50 weeks 
will be non- inferior to the proportion of subjects where an event occurs by [CONTACT_941] 50 
week s in the control group.  The statistical hypothesis to be tested is : 
 
Η0: πt > πc + δ 
vs. 
 
Η1: πt < πc + δ 
 
where δ=0.125 (clinically insignificant difference) and πc is the event rate in the 
control group and the πt is the event rate in the treatment group.  The statistical test to 
be used shall be the Blackwelder (1982) non- inferiority test and will be evaluated 
based on the intent- to-treat subject population. 
 
The events comprising the composite primary safety endpoints are provided in the 
table below  for all patients, for patients grouped by [CONTACT_51626] (< 25 or 
≥ 25), and patients grouped by [CONTACT_51627] (equal to 3 or not).

A Cox regression multivariate analysis was done on the primary safety endpoint (all 
cause mortality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) for events through 350 days.  Variables were screened by  [CONTACT_51628] (2000) with a P-
value for admission into competition for the final model of 0.2.  Univariate Cox models including the covariate of interest and its interaction with treatment were used for screening.   If the interaction term with treatment is not significant, a second model 
was done without the interaction to screen for the main effect.    The variables that were screened and their corresponding P -values are presented in 
the table below.

Rubin (1987) indicates that the data from multiple imputations can be combined to 
get an overall test of significance.  The method is the basis of Proc MIANALYZ E in 
SAS and is described in the online manual SAS OnlineDoc Version 8, Chapter 10 (Proc MIANALYZE), page 211.  The procedure computes the mean difference across all imputations by [CONTACT_51632]

where Q i is the difference between the Optmizer proportion and the control 
proportion for the ith imputation and m is the number of imputations (M=10 here)

The analysis of the combined imputations for FASB ( EF≥25 and NYHA=3) resulted 
in a z=-2.1549 with corresponding P=0.0156.  Theses imputation analyses by [CONTACT_51635], FASA, or FASB all resulted in similar outcomes.  The whole population does not demonstrate statistical significance at a 0.025.  The sub group of pat ients with baseline EF ≥25 results in a P -value less than 0.05, but 
slightly above the 0.025 value and the sub-group with EF ≥25 and NYHA=3 achieves 
statistical significance with P<0.025.

2Responder is a 10 or more point improvement from baseline.  
3Responder is a 1 or more point improvement from baseline.  
4Responder is a 40 or more meters improvement from baseline.  
 
Note that there are higher proportions of  responders i n the Optimizer group for all of the 
endpoints and time periods.  The P-value for patients experiencing a 10 or more point decline 
in the MLWHFQ at both 24 and 50 weeks are highly statistically significant and NYHA at 24

These analyses indicate that for CC patients with EF ≥25 and NYHA = 3, Optimizer 
patients have greater response than control patients and it is significantly greater for MLWHFQ and NYHA at 24 weeks and for MLWHFQ at 50 weeks with a P<0.025.  These additional analyses indicate that Optimizer patients had greater changes from baseline than control patients across all measures.  Statistical significance in responder analyses with P -values less than 0.025 was achieved for all Optimizer CC 
patients for MLWHFQ overall at 24 and 50 weeks and NYHA for 24 weeks.  For patient sub-grouped with EF ≥25 whether or not the NYHA =3, the AT responder 
analysis demonstrated superiority for the Optimizer patients with P- values less than 
0.025 at both 24 and 50 weeks.  In these patients, the PVO2 demonstrated a 
significant advantage for Optimizer patients at 24 weeks .

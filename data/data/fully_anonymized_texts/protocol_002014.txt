Hyperhidrosis is a condition of excessive sweating beyond what is physiologically required to 
maintain normal thermal regula tion, and where the sudomotor system is functioning excessively 
for no apparent reason. The sudomotor system consists of neurons that control sweat output through activation of cholinergic receptors on sweat glands.  
Primary hyperhidrosis (excessive sweati ng without a known cause) is localized (focal), is 
characteristically symmetric, and can affect the axillae, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, 
face, and other areas. Secondary hyperhidrosis can be either focal or generalized and results from 
any number of conditions, including endocrine, metabolic, neurologic, and cardiovascular disorders or can result from the use of medications.  
In a survey of households in the [LOCATION_002], using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale 
and items from the Hyperhidrosis Impact questionnaire, the prevalence of the disease was 
estimated to be about 4.8% [1] . 
 
In [ADDRESS_884215] prevalent type of 
hyperhidrosis in the study sam ple was axillary (68%) followed by [CONTACT_388074] (65%).  Data published 
in 2016 found that the majority of primary palmar hyperhidrosis patients reported childhood onset and less than 12 years of age [2] .  
Hyperhidrosis can have a substantial and debilitating effect on quality of life. Several quality of life studies conducted on individuals with hyperhidrosis have shown that excessive sweating 
often impedes normal daily activities and can result in occupational, emotional, psychological, 
social, and physical impairment.[3, 4] 
Current therapeutic options for treating hyperhidrosis vary by [CONTACT_656538][INVESTIGATOR_656512]. Nonsurgical treatments include top ical application of aluminum 
chloride products (e.g., Drysol®), tap water iontophoresis with or without anticholinergics, oral dosing with anticholinergics (e.g., Robinul®), intradermal injection of botulinum toxin (Botox®), and application of microwave energy (e.g., miraDry®). Surgical techniques are 
reserved for patients with severe disease and include endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy, 
excision of axillary sweat glands, and axillary liposuction. Limited efficacy and skin irritation limit the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_656513]. Iontophoresis, though effective for some 
patients, is a time consuming and somewhat painful treatment. Oral anticholinergics are 
efficacious, but have substantial side effects (e.g., blurred vision, tachycardia, dry mouth, urinary retention, increased ocular tension, and constipation) that often outweigh benefits [5, 6]. 
Botulinum toxin injections are also effective; however, very few patients receive botulinum toxin 
due to the high cost and pain associated with the required multiple injections. miraDry, a microwave device designed to destroy sweat glands, appears to be effective, but is expensive, 
requires repeat treatment, and can b e painful [7, 8]. Thus, there is a clear need for a safe, 
nonirritating, noninvasive, easy- to-use, and effective treatment for this indication.

GLYCOPYRRONIUM CLOTH  DRM04 -HH10  
Final 11 Dec 2018 Page 11 Confidential  Glycopyrrolate (glycopyrronium bromide) is a synthetic, quaternary ammonium compound with 
a well -known pharmacology (anticholinergic) that acts as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. As 
with other anticholinergic agents, glycopyrrolate inhibits the action of acetylcholine on structures innervated by [CONTACT_656539], such as sweat glands. Under physiologic conditions, glycopyrrolate dissociates generating the glycopyrronium cation; therefore, the 
pharmacological activity of glycopyrrolate is mediated by [CONTACT_656540].  
The pharmacology of glycopyrrolate is well understood. Published nonclinical and clinical data 
have documented the safe use of glycopyrrolate by [CONTACT_656541], intravenous, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [9, 10]. The adverse effects associated with glycopyrrolate are 
generally limited to its pharmacologic actions as an anti- muscarinic agent [11] . 
Glyc opyrronium carries a positive charge and does not readily cross the blood- brain barrier, thus 
minimizing central nervous system (CN S)-related adverse events (AEs) [12] . Systemic AEs 
observed with oral dosing include dry mouth, mydriasis, blurred vision, tachycardia, increased ocular tension, and constipation. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_656514].

tests may be repeated  one time  in order to confirm out of range results  or clinical significance, at 
the discretion of the investigator.  
The central laboratory should be used for any laboratory testing required for a subject during study participation, including laboratory testing needed for unscheduled visits. Clinically 
significant laboratory results must be recorded on the adverse event eCRF, preferably as a 
diagnosis rather than individual  test results. Any subject who has a clinically significant 
laboratory test result  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978], and will be treated and/or followed up at the

9.3.5 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a study drug in humans, whether or not conside red drug related. An AE can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not related to the investigational product .  
Adverse events (A Es) will be monitored throughout  the study. Subjects will be instructed to 
inform the Principal Investigator (PI ) and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit , subjects will 
be asked about AE s in a non- specific manner using open- ended  questions so as not to bias the 
response (e.g., How have you been since the last visit ?). Specific inquiry regarding reported AEs 
will be conducted when applicable. All adverse events will be documented and recorded in the 
subject’s e CRF .  
Any subject who has a n AE (whether serious or non- serious) or clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory test value  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978], and will be treated and/or followed up until the 
symptoms or values return to normal or to clinically acceptable levels, as judged by t he PI. 
A physician, either at clinical site, or at a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_9487], will administer 
Dermira, Inc.  
GLYCOPYRRONIUM CLOTH  DRM04 -HH10  
Final 11 Dec 2018 Page 26 Confidential  treatment for any serious adverse events ( SAEs ), if necessary. When appropriate, medical tests 
and examinations will be performed to document resolution of event(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting  
Only AEs that occur during or following study treatment with the drug will be reported in the AE 
section of the eCRF . Events recorded prior to study treatment with the drug will be reported in 
the Medical History section of the eCRF  as appropriate. All AEs occurring during the course of 
the study will be individually recorded in the e CRF . A condition that is present prior to 
administration of study drug and that worsens after administration of study drug should be reported as an AE. Information regarding the onset, duration, severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to study drug will be recorded .  
New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if 
they are considered to be of clinical significance by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_656526]  9.3.6. 
Unless a diagnosis is available, signs and symptoms must be reported as individual AEs in the 
eCRF; a diagnosis is preferred.  
The severity of an  AE will be designated as mild, moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used 
to describe the intensity of an adverse event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor clinical significance (e.g. ‘severe’ upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] ). Severity is  not the same as 
“serious”. Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE .  
The relationship of the AE to the study treatment will be based on the following two definitions : 
Not related : An AE is defined as “not related” if the AE is not judged to be as sociated with the 
study drug and is attributable to another cause; 
Related : An AE is defined as “related” where a causal relationship between  the event and  the 
study drug is a reasonable possibility  (possibly or probably related) . A reasonable causal 
relationship is meant to convey that there are facts (e.g., evidence such as dechallenge/  
rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to suggest a causal relationship between the AE and 
study treatment.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_884240] medical occurrence that , at any dose, 
• Results in death;  
• Is immediately  life-threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], the AE places the subject  at 
immediate risk of death ; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form , might have caused death); 
• Requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1666] ; 
• Results in  persistent or significant disability  or incapacity ; 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; 
Dermira, Inc.  
GLYCOPYRRONIUM CLOTH  DRM04 -HH10  
Final  11 Dec 2018 Page 27 Confidential  • Is an important medical event  that may  not be immediately life -threatening , result in 
death , or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, it jeopardizes  the subject  or may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed above . 
As soon as the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_656527], the SAE should be 
documented to the extent that information is available. A report must be submitted by [CONTACT_656552], w ithin [ADDRESS_884241] be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(within  24 hours of the PI’s knowledge of the event) . Forms for reporting SAEs will be provided 
to the study site .  
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent, through to end of the study. If in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], an SAE occurring outside the specified time window (i.e., following 
subject  completion or withdraw al from  the study) , is deemed to be drug- related , then the event 
should be reported within  [ADDRESS_884242] -mortem findings/reports will be requested . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious  Adverse Events 
All SAEs, as defined by [CONTACT_29967], must be reported to the Sponsor  or designee  using the 
SAE Form  provided, within [ADDRESS_884243] number, event description, SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered to be serious (i.e., the seriousness 
criteria), and PI’s assessment of t he relationsh ip of the event to study drug. Additional SAE 
information including medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, and the 
outcome/resolution of the event should also be recorded on the SAE Reporting  Form. 
In all cases,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_656528] . The Investigator may be required to provide 
supplementary information as requested by [CONTACT_39987] . 
When r eporting SAEs, the following additional points should be considered:  
• When the diagnosis of an SAE is known or suspected, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_656529], rather than as signs or symptoms ; signs, 
symptoms and tests tha t support the diagnosis should be provided.  
• Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE, unless the 
event preceding the death is unknown. If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report should be provided.  
While most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656530], some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_294708], as follows:

existing condition that has not worsened after administration of  study drug (e.g., a 
previously scheduled ventral hernia repair). SAEs must, however, be reported for any 
surgical or procedural complication resulting in prol ongation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Events that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656531] 24 hours and that do 
not require admission  or therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room 
visit for hematuria that results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics).  
The Sponsor will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received. For each 
SAE received, the Sponsor will make a determination as to whether the criteria for expedited reporting to relevant regulatory authorities have been met.  
The Sponsor will assess the expectedness of each SAE to the study treatment. The current 
Investigator’s Brochure will be used as the reference document to assess expectedness of the 
event to study drug. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_884244] experience intolerable tre atment -related adverse

10 STUDY DISCONTINUATIONS  
10.1 Discontinuation of the Study  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate or to stop the study at any time. Shou ld this be necessary, 
both the Sponsor and the Investigator will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures 
are completed . The entire study will be stopped if:  
• Evidence has emerged that, in the collective opi[INVESTIGATOR_656532], makes the continuation 
of the study unnecessary or unethical. 
• The stated objectives of the study  are achieved . 
• The Sponsor discontinues the development of the study drug. 
Regardless of  the reason for  withdrawal , all data available for the subject  at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRF . All reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented.

subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time . If the subject withdraws 
consent and discontinues from the study, the Investigator will attempt to schedule  an Early 
Withdraw al Visit as soon as possible, determine the reason for discontinuation , and record the 
reason in the subject’s study records and i n the eCRF.   
If at any time during the study, the Investigator determines that it is not in the best interes t of the 
subject to continue, the subject will be discontinued from participation . The Investigator can 
discontinue a subject at any time if medically necessary . The Investigator may discontinue a 
subject’s participation if the subject has failed to follow  study procedures or to keep follow -up 
appointments . Prior to discontinuing a subject from study participation, the Investigator will 
discuss his/her intentions with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee . Appropriate 
documentation in the subject’s study record and e CRF regarding the reason for discontinuation 
must be completed.  
All subjects who fail to return to the study center for the required follow -up visits will be

visit or elected to discontinue from the study. If a subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_34675] a 
minimum of two documented attempts (one attempt on two different days), a registered letter 
will be sent requesting that subject contact [CONTACT_656554] -up.  
Subjects will be discontinue d early from the study if any of the following occur:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason).  
• Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or inter -current illness which, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the 
study is not in the best interest of the subject.  
• Death.  
• Serious protocol violation, including persistent non- compliance or subject requiring 
medication or procedures prohibited by [CONTACT_760], to allow subjects to receive the appropriate medical attention. In such cases, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_16015], as the final decision to withdraw the subject will be taken by [CONTACT_1034]. 
• Discontinuat ion of the study by [CONTACT_1034] . 
10.3 Study Drug Discontinuation  
For subjects who decide to prematurely discontinue study drug treatment, all reasonable efforts 
should be made to obtain all protocol -specified safety assessments and end of stu dy procedures .  
The I nvestigator should stop study drug treatment in the following instances:  
• Inter -current  illness that would, in the judgment of the I nvestigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree.

11 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
11.1 General Statistical Methodology  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® un less otherwise stated. No interim 
analyses are planned. Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two -sided and will be 
performed at the 0.05 level of significance.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and saf ety res ults. 
For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be 
presented. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of subjects), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median , minimum and max imum. Appropriate inferential 
statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables.  
As a sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used 
(i.e., the last available on -therapy observation for a subjec t will be used to estimate subsequent 
missing data points).  
Demographic data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070]. Subjects’ 
Baseline characteristics related to efficacy analyses will be compared with descriptive statistics 
among treatment groups to ensure comparable results.  
The number of subjects in each analysis set will be summarized. Reasons for study withdrawal during the blinded study will be summarized using frequencies and percentages by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Sweat producti on will be measured gravimetrically for each hand at each time point. Analyses of 
sweat production will be based on the mean of the right and left hand measurements.  
Subjects are to complete the hand sweating severity item  #[ADDRESS_884250]’s responses to item # 1 will be computed for each week, weekly mean 
response to item # [ADDRESS_884251] has 
responses to item # [ADDRESS_884252] has 3 or fewer 
responses to item # 1, the value will be considered missing.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments.  
11.1.1 Populations Analyzed  
Approximately 60 subjects  (including subjects  ≥9 years ) will be randomized to glycopyrronium  
cloth , 2.4% or vehicle treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio. Efficacy analyses will be performed using 
the intent -to-treat (ITT) population and the per -protocol (PP) population. Safety analyses will be 
performed u sing the safety population. 
Dermira, Inc.  
GLYCOPYRRONIUM CLOTH  DRM04 -HH10  
Final  [ADDRESS_884253] one confirmed dose of study drug will be 
included in the safety population.  
The PP population will include all subjects in the safety population who complete the Week 2 
evaluation without any significant protocol vi olations (i.e., any subject or I nvestigator activity 
that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the  study drug or the 
precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include subjects in the safety 
population who do not meet any of the following criteria:  
• Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Used an interfering concom itant medication or underwent a prohibited procedure;  
• Did not attend the Week 2 visit;

Exact Test.  
For the s econdary e fficacy e ndpoint:  
• Mean absolute change from baseline in gravimetrically -measured sweat production at 
Week 2. 
Each a ctive treatment group will be compared to its corresponding vehicle group using the 
Wilcoxon rank- sum nonparametric test and the two sample t -test. 
No imputation of missing values will be performed. The observed data will be analyzed. 
Subjects 16 years or older will be asked to provide answers to items 2, 3 and 4.T abulations  of 
their data will be based on the following methodology. Daily Diary (DD) contains a set of diary 
items  designed to m easure the severity and impact of any hand sweating collected daily wherein 
the evaluation is focused on the past [ADDRESS_884255]’s global 
impression of change and is only collected at end of treatment (EOT) visit.  
The scoring of each answer for questions 2 and 3 is as follows:  
Q2 / Q3: Not at all / Not at all bothered  scored 0  
Q2 / Q3: A little bit / A little bothered  scored 1  
Q2 / Q3: A moderate amount / Moderately bothered scored 2  
Q2 / Q3: A great deal / Very bothered  scored 3  
Q2 / Q3: An extreme amount / Extremely bothered scored 4  
Subjects will complete the DD for 4 -7 days within 7 days of randomization during the screening 
period. Daily data will be averaged and used to compute baseline scores. Baseline DD scores will be calculated as follows:  
• Baseline scores for items  2 and 3: The most recent 7 days prior to randomization day 
(Day 1) will be averaged to calculate the baseline scores for i tems  [ADDRESS_884256] misses more than 4 days of

Appendix  A: Gravimetric Measurement o f Sweat Production  
Study sites must use the equipment and supplies provided by [CONTACT_656563] (Mettler b alance, gauze pads, plastic bags, timer, non- latex, flock -lined gloves in 
multiple sizes  and temperature/humidity device). A source document template  will be provided 
to study sites to capture information on the gravimetric procedure . 
The room used for the gravimetric procedure must be at a temperature of 68  to 76°F (20.0-24.0°C) 
and controlled for humidity. This information is recorded as part of the gravimetric procedure for each subject.  
Prior to starting the gravimetric procedure , subjects must be evaluated for the appropriate size 
flock -lined glove and acclimated to the room where the procedure will be conducted . Flock -lined 
gloves will capture sweat production so the size selected should be snug but not overly tight .   
Have all supplies ready in ad vance of starting the gravimetric procedure.  
1. Clear the temperature device.  
2. Place the subject in the room.  
3. Record the start time of the acclimatization period, the room humidity and the room 
temperature at the beginning of the acclimation period.  
4. Acclimati on is [ADDRESS_884267]’s hand an d slowly remove the glove . Press the gauze gently against both 
sides of the hand to fully absorb any residual sweat from  the hand.  Immediately place 
flock -lined  glove and gauze  back in the plastic bag.

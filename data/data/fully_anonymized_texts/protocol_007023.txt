After a review of the 1st cohort results, it was decided that an additional two cohorts be added and to 
remove references to the second stage (parallel design portion) of the study.  The parallel design study 
will be conducted under a new protocol with new numbering identifier with the design features to be 
determined after the results from all three cohorts are evaluated.  Additional changes were made to 
reduce confusion and augment the standard of care treatment for all subjects.

adverse events (AEs) to resolution or establishment of a new baseline.  
Study Objectives:  Primary  Objective :  To evaluate the efficacy  of a single intraoperative 
administration of CA-008 vs. placebo  in subjects undergoing an elective C-
ABD .  
Secondary  Objectives:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intraoperative 
administration of CA -008 vs. vehicle placebo in subjects undergoing an 
elective C-ABD.  
• To evaluate the PK profile of a single intraoperative administration of 
CA-008 vs. vehicle placebo in subjects undergoing an elective C-ABD .  
• To evaluate the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing effect of CA -008 vs. placebo  in terms of 
consumption and time to cessation.  
Study Treatment 
Dosing Schedule:  Study treatment is to be administered intraoperatively as a single 
administration via “surgical site” infiltration prior to wound closure.   
“Surgical site” is defined as the area extending approximately 2 -3 cm in all 
directions (lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the incision site and 
surrounding tissues.  
Anesthesia:  The surgery is to be performed under general anesthesia supplemented by a 
transverse abdominis plane ( TAP ) block  and local surgical site infiltration .  
Prior to the  surgery , perform the TAP block  as a single injection of 0. 25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_84684] (HCl) 60 mL ( 150 mg).  
Dose Groups:  • Cohort #1: total N=18 randomized 1:1 CA -008 5 mg or  placebo  
• Cohort #2: total N=18 randomized 2:1 CA -008 10 mg or  placebo  
• Cohort #3: total N=18 randomized 2:1 CA -008 15 mg or  placebo  
• Optional 4th cohort with a total N=24 randomized 1:1 to CA -008 or 
placebo at a dose between 5 mg and 15 mg as determined based upon 
results from cohorts #1 -3 
The volume for each cohort is 100 mL of CA -008 or placebo vehicle.   
Injection of Study 
Treatment:  Prior to wound closure, study treatment will be infiltrated uniformly 
throughout  the soft tissues  around surgical sites  with particular attention to 
the rectus fascia .   
A 25 g (or lar ger) 3.5” spi[INVESTIGATOR_521713].  
Note that T0 is the time that the study treatment injection is completed.  
Allowed 
Substitutions:  Note that if any standard of care drugs are  unavailable, for example due to 
stock outages, available clinically equivalent alternatives may be substituted, 
particularly for the protocol -specified  analgesic drugs for intraoperative or

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 9 of 105 postoperative inpatient analgesia , after approval of the medical monitor who 
should notify Sponsor of said substitution.  
Intraoperative 
Analgesia:  Within [ADDRESS_676638] IV hydromorphone 
0.02 mg/kg.  
During the  surgery, ensure that each subject has received at least [ADDRESS_676639] discretion.  
Within 15 min of the end of surgery, administer IV acetaminophen 1g 
(Ofirmev® full prescribing information at http://ofirmev.com/ ) and IV 
hydromorphone 0.007 mg/kg . 
Inpatient Analgesia:  
 No non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_521714] (through T96h).  
Postsurgical Care:  After surgery, subjects will be monitored in the post -anesthesia care unit 
(PACU) during which time efficacy asssessments can begin once the subject 
is awake.  Document PACU entrance and discharge times.  
After discharge from the PACU, subjects are followed through T96h as an 
inpatient.  Safety and efficacy evaluations will be performed and blood 
drawn and urine collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.  Subjects 
will be required to meet standard criteria for discharge to outpatient status .  
Subjects will continue to be monitored as an outpatient after discharge 
through D29/W4 for various safety and efficacy assessments, and later if 
necessary for safety follow up.  
Rescue Medication 
During the Inpatient 
Stay : During the PACU stay, the subject may be administered IV fentanyl 25 -50 
mcg q5 min prn for moderate -to-severe pain (≥ 4) as reported by [CONTACT_521743] 0 to 10 numerical rating scale of current pain intensity (NRS).   
From the time of PACU discharge thr ough T12h administer IV 
hydromorphone 0.2 to 0.5 mg q10 -15 min prn for NRS ≥ 4 as reported by 
[CONTACT_1766].  
After T12h, administer PO oxycodone 5 mg q2h prn moderate pain (NRS ≥ 
4 and ≤ 6) or 10 mg q2h prn severe pain (NRS ≥ 7).   
After T24, administer PO oxyc odone 5 mg q4h prn moderate pain (NRS ≥ 4 
and ≤ 6) or 10 mg q4h prn severe pain (NRS ≥ 7)  
Subjects will be encouraged to rescue only for moderate -to-severe pain 
scores (NRS ≥ 4), however rescue may be requested at any time and 
medication will be provided w hen requested.  
Analgesia during the 
Outpatient Period:  
 Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be 
instructed to take a combination of over -the-counter (OTC) analgesics at an 
appropriate dose per medical judgment to manage any  residual or 
breakthrough postsurgical pain.  
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-204               Confidential  
 
 
Version: [ADDRESS_676640] is still requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_149151] 12h prior to discharge from 
the inpatient unit (i.e., from T84h on regardless of whether discharge is 
delayed) , then prescribe no more than 9 tablets of oxyco done 5 mg (1 PO tid 
prn) per investigator discretion for the initial outpatient period . 
If needed for pain management, acetaminophen up to 1000  mg prn tid /qid 
(3g daily maximum limit)  and ibuprofen 400 -600 mg prn tid/qid will be 
recommended for subjects to  self-administer (note that th ese medications 
will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034]) . 
Persistent pain or pain exacerbations during the outpatient period may 
suggest the need for an unscheduled in -person visit to assess the surgical 
site.  If such a situation  occurs, the Investigator should use clinical discretion 
on adequacy of analgesic treatment, but to capture this event as an adverse 
event (AE) and document any required treatments.

Safety Parameter 
Assessment Times:   • Incidence of spontaneous reported TEAEs or SAEs from T0 through 
D29/W4 or later if necessary:  
o TEAEs are defined as AEs occurring post T0  
o AEs recorded from the time the informed consent form (ICF) is 
signed up to D0/T0 will be recorded in medical history.   
• PE: full PE at screening (without a breast, genital or rectal examination). 
Interim targeted PE on D -1 or D0 prior to surgery (to be conducted on 
D0 if not done on D -1), T96h, and as an outpatient on D8/W1, D15/W2, 
and D29/W4 (later if necessary).  
• Vital signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR]) 
at screening, D0 prior to surgery, post -surgery T1, T2, T4, T6, T12, and 
T24h, and every 8 hours thereafter until T96h, and as an outpatient on 
D8/W1, D15/W2, and D29/W4 or later if necess ary.  Assess temperature 
on D -1 or D0 prior to surgery. Daily temps can be recorded along with 
vital signs per site SOPs at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and every 8 hours thereafter 
until discharge from the inpatient facility (if awake at the time of 
assessment bet ween hours of midnight and 6 a.m.).  
• Surgical site assessments at T96h (prior to discharge from the unit) and 
then as an outpatient on D8/W1, D15/W2, and D29/W4 (later if 
necessary) .  If there are skin reactions atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84699], 
e.g., more than expected erythema, drainage, bruising or hematoma, 
induration, swelling or other skin changes, they should be documented 
as AEs, graded for severity and followed regularly until resolution or 
establishment of a new baseline.  
• Neurosensory testing near the incision (compared to a control site just 
distal to the costal margin ) will be performed at Screening visit, T96h 
(prior to discharge from the unit) and then as an outpatient on D8/W1, 
D15/W2, and D29/W4.  
o Numbness at or near the incision need not be considered a 
neurologic AE since this could occur because of tissue trauma 
and inflammation from the surgery.  
o Sensory deficits or clinically significant persistent sensory 
change beyond the area immediately proximal/distal to the 
incision at time of discha rge, such as allodynia or hyperalgesia,

Version: [ADDRESS_676645] be designated as a neurologic AE. Subjects will be 
followed until there is a return to baseline or establishment of a 
new baseline.  
• Query subjects as to whether they have experienced any rebound or 
worsening pai n at the surgical site at D8, 15 and 29.  
• ECGs, standard clinical labs at screening and post -surgery as specified 
in the Schedule of Assessments and outlined below   The Investigator is 
responsible for determining if out of range laboratory values are 
clinically significant or not.  All clinically significant values will be 
recorded in the eCRF and followed until resolution.   
o ECG at screening and T24±2 h  
o Hematology/Coagulation at screening and T96±4h: 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count with 
differential, red blood cell count, platelet count, 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and 
prothrombin time (PT) or international normalization 
ratio (INR).    
o Blood Chemistry at screening and T96±4h to include at 
least the following: Alanine aminotr ansferase (ALT; 
SGPT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST; SGOT), 
total bilirubin (TBili), gamma -glutamyl transferase 
(GGT), albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, 
alkaline phosphatase (ALK), sodium, potassium, 
calcium, chloride and glucose.  
o Serum  and urine pregnancy test for FCBP: βhCG test at 
screening and urine test usually to be done within 24 
hours prior to surgery.  
o Urinalysis at screening and T96±4h: including macroscopic 
analysis and, if indicated, microscopic analysis.

 1. NRS scores will be assessed as follows:  
• During the inpatient stay, NRS at rest beginning with the PACU 
admission may be assessed once the subject is awake.  If the subject 
is able to provide responses, obtain NRS scores at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 
12, 16, 20, 24, and every 4 hours (if awake at time of assessment) 
until discharge from the inpatient unit.   Time windows: for T0.5 to 
T2 (± 5 min ) and from T4 onward (±15 min ). 
• Pain scores may be skipped between the hours of midnight an d [ADDRESS_676646] may not miss two consecutive assessments.  
• An additional NRS assessment must be obtained prior to rescue 
medication request (±15 min) .  The T12, T24, T48, T72 and T96h 
assessments must be completed even if the subject is asleep at these 
times.

 • During the inpatient stay, starting on postoperative day 1  perform 
the following  each morning : on arising at  0800h (±2 h) and each 
evening at 2000h (±2 h) document the NRS on arising from a 
recumbent position to a sitting or standing position .  Actual 
assessment times must be documented .  If however these twice daily 
assessments coincide with timed assessments of NRS at rest, then 
the time assessment at rest is used in place of the twice daily 
assessments.   Resting pain scores are performed on th e schedule 
noted above in the first bullet.  
• During the outpatient period, instruct the patient to document, if 
possible, their NRS scores twice daily at 0800h (± 4h) and 2000h 
(±4h) at rest and on arising from a recumbent position to a sitting or 
standing p osition at T96. W1. W2. Amd W4 .  Note that the actual 
time of these assessments must be documented in the diary

medication or 2  (±15min ) hours after tak ing any pain 
medication  
o Obtain the evening NRS assessment 2 (±15min ) hours after 
taking any pain medication  
2. Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (OC) and daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (rescue medication) 
consumption in MEDs will be recorded during the inpatient period.   
• Document subject days in which no rescue medication or analgesic 
consumption is required (opi[INVESTIGATOR_39895], OF) during the inpatient and 
outpatient period.   
• Document daily use of OTC analgesics (and oxycodone if 
prescribed) during the outpatient period.   
• Docu ment the fraction of subjects who rescue at T6, T12, T24, T48,

Sample Size 
Justification:  Given the uncertainty in estimating a sample size for C -ABD surgery, the 
data from the current study will be used to determine the sample size for a 
subsequent parallel design study  selecting one or more optimal doses of CA -
[ADDRESS_676647] of care for abdominoplasty . 
Study Populations:  The following three analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• The Safety Population will include all subjects who received any part of 
a dose of study treatment.   
• The PK Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of 
study treatme nt and complete all PK assessments . 
• The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects as 
randomized to study treatment.  The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) 
Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of study 
treatment and complete the first 3 pain assessments (through T2h).   
• Study completers (Study Completers) will include all subjects who 
receive a full dose of study treatment and complete the entire study 
period through D29±2/W4.  
Subjects who elect to discontinue study participation  (early termination or 
ET) after randomization but prior to receiving study treatment will be 
replaced.   

Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-204               Confidential  
 
 
Version: [ADDRESS_676648] to 
discontinue participation prior to D8 (W1) will be considered to have 
terminated as of the date of their election, however they will b e asked to 
return to the site one time, if willing and at their conven ience, to ensure 
wound healing.  
Statistical 
Considerations:  
 All safety assessments and baseline characteristics will be summarized using 
the Safety Population.  Efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT 
population.  PK analyses will be performed using the PK population.  All 
summaries will be grouped by [CONTACT_84810].  Subjects 
receiving vehicle placebo will be combined for summaries.  
Safety and tolerability wi ll be evaluated by [CONTACT_373421], including Treatment -Emergent AEs.  AEs leading to discontinuation 
from the study, AEs related to study treatment and AE severity will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].   
Actual and change from baseline in  clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, 
and ECGs will also be assessed and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  These 
data will be summarized using descriptive statistics including n, mean, SD, 
SEM (if appropriate), median, minimum and maximum.  Abnormal va lues 
will be determined and flagged in the listings.  Laboratory shift tables 
displaying the change (number of subjects) relative to the normal range from 
baseline to each study visit will also be presented by [CONTACT_84777].  
The Investigator sho uld exercise medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.  
While the study is not specifically designed to detect a significant difference 
in efficacy between CA -008 and placebo, efficacy analyses will be 
performed as secondary endpoints.

5.1. Background  
Concentric Analgesics, Inc. (Concentric) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_84712] -[ADDRESS_676675] -surgical pain following a single local administration  (for 96h and beyond) .  CA-008 
is a prodrug of trans -capsaicin (trans -8-methyl -N-vanillyl -6-nonenamide) , the substance in chili 
peppers that produces the sensation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_84713].  Capsaicin is a transient receptor potential 
cation channel, subfamily V (vanilloid), member 1 (TRPV1)  agonist.  TRPV1 is a ligand -gated, 
nonselective, cation channel preferentially expressed most densely in C -fiber nociceptors and to 
a lesser extent on Aδ –fiber nociceptors (Babbar 2009, Caterina 2001 ). TRPV1 responds to 
noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heat, and extracellular acidification, and integrates 
simultaneous exposures to these stimuli (Suresh 2010, Surh 1995, Tominaga 1998 ).   
Capsaicin exposure  to TRPV -1-expressing nociceptor peripheral terminals  results in initial 
excitation of the nociceptor followed by a functional desensitization which continues for some 
time after removal of capsaicin from the site.  Capsaicin, however, is virtually insoluble in 
aqueous media  or local anesthetic solu tions which means that capsaicin formulations tend to be 
quite hydrophobic and viscous making them hard to inject and less likely to permeate surgical 
site tissues.  Anesiva, which had been developi[INVESTIGATOR_373381] -surgical 
pain and osteoarthritis, solubilized capsaicin in polyethylene glycol  300 (Hartrick  2011 ).  The 
product was instilled into the open surgical site and after waiting for [ADDRESS_676676] or had clinical development programs for such products .  
Centrexion Therapeutics has an active development program (CTNX -4975) for intraarticular 
injection of capsaicin for chronic osteoarthritis  and Morton’s neuroma (see 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 29 of 105 http://centrexion.com/our -pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]/ ).  Note that Centrexion is using the Anesiva highly viscous 
polyethylene glycol formulation for its intraarticular knee joint injections.  
5.2. CA-[ADDRESS_676677].  The 
free base form of CA-008 rapi[INVESTIGATOR_521721] a 
cyclic urea,  as shown in the scheme below:  
 
CA-008 was specifically selected for development due to its short half -life (<5 min) at neutral 
pH.  In Tris buffer at pH 7.4 and 37°C, it completely breaks apart to capsaicin and CA -101 as the 
sole degradants.  
The cyclic urea (CA-101) formed has not been previously evaluated for biological activity.  
While not a known compound in the clinical literature, its safety was evaluated in all nonclinical 
studies with CA -008 and it was shown to be inactive.  The toxicokinetic profiles for CA -008, 
CA-101, and capsaicin were determined in GLP safety studies  and the PK profile for various 
doses were determined in a Phase 1 ascending dose safety study in patients undergoing 
bunion ectomy . 
5.3. Previous Human experience  
There is substantial clinical support for the potential safety of capsaicin, the active molecule 
released by [CONTACT_28474] -008 in vivo.  In addition to consumption in hot spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716] (chili peppers), 
capsaicin is an approved product for dermal applications for OTC and prescription use (Qutenza; 
8% patch for management of neuropathic pain associated with post herpetic neuralgia) , is 
frequently used intradermally in experimental pain models,  and has been studied clinically for 
wound ins tillation for postsurgical analgesia (Anesiva; Adlea; capsaicin for instillation).

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 30 of 105 5.3.1.  Study CA -PS-201 (Bunionectomy)  
A first-in-human study (Study CA -PS-2017 -101) evaluated  the safety and tolerability of CA -[ADDRESS_676678] metatarsal osteotomy for correction of 
hallux valgus deformity, more commonly known as a  bunionectomy.  This study also evaluated 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary efficacy assessment of CA -008 to inform future studies in 
our clinical develop ment plan.   This study was originally designed to look at 4 different doses of 
CA-008 (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 3 mg) , however based upon the relatively benign adverse 
event (AE) profile, the Data Management Committee gave the go -ahead for a 5th cohort (4.2 mg) 
to be added .  The safety, efficacy and PK results for the Phase 1 bunionectomy study are shown 
in the current Investigators’ Brochure.    
Additionally, a follow -on Phase 2 bunionectomy study (CA -PS-201) was completed with 147 
subjects enrol led and randomized to one of 3 active doses: 0.05 mg/mL (0.7 mg), 0.15 mg/mL 
(2.1 mg) and 0.3 mg/mL (4.2 mg) vs. placebo in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_676679] dose of 4.2 mg was statistically significantly superior to placebo for the 
primary efficacy endpoint of AUC 0 -96h (p=0.005) and key secondary efficacy endpoints: AUC 
0 to week 1 (p=0.036); mean opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (reduced by 50%, p<0.002); and percent of 
subjects who were opi[INVESTIGATOR_149162] 0 to 96h (26% vs. 5% for placebo; p=0.039).  The following

5.3.2.  Study CA -PS-204 (Abdominopl asty)  
Preliminary unblinded safety data was made available with an interim data snapshot after the 
first cohort (5 mg) was completed.  For this cohort, 18 subjects were randomized 1:[ADDRESS_676681] 
(TAP) block , intraoperative IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_521722] . 
There were 8/9 subjects in each treatment group who experienced TEAEs: [ADDRESS_676682] TEAEs were moderate in severity: 20/28 in the 
placebo group and 20/[ADDRESS_676683] TEAEs were deemed unrelated.  There were 
5/28 possibly related events in the placebo group (all nausea events)  and 2/26 possible related in 
the active group (one each of pruritus – mild and nausea – moderate).  The most frequent TEAEs 
in descending order were:  
• Placebo:  nausea – 14; low back pain – 5; vomiting, constipation and hypoxia at [ADDRESS_676684] single  events  
• CA-008: nausea – 9; headache – 5; low back pain – 3; constipation – 3; and the rest were 
single events  
5.4. Study Rationale  
CA-008 is being investigated as a potential therapy for treatment of pain following surgery.   

 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 42 of 105 5.5. Dose  Rationale  
5.5.1.   Selection of Doses  
The safety of CA -008 was established in relevant animal models and supported by [CONTACT_149188] (CA-PS-2017 -101 and CA -PS-201) and knowledge from prior human 
studies with an injectable formulation of c apsaicin.  Taken together, the characte rization of the 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology profiles are considered sufficient to support the 
intended use of CA -008 in th is study.  
5.5.2.  Selection and Timing of Dose  
CA-008 is a pH labile prodrug of capsaicin that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_521723] a fter administration 
into tissue.   Decision for single administration at the time of surgery is based on capsaicin’s 
mechanism of action. Capsaicin exposure results in initial excitation followed by a functional 
desensitization of TRPV -1-expressing nocicep tors which continues for some time after removal 
of capsaicin from the site.   Administration while the patient is under anesthesia for the 
procedure supplemented by a regional local anesthetic block or local anesthetic infiltration 
addresses the pain that  results from TRPV1 agonism.  Administration of CA -008 during the  
closure process is ideal for delivering therapy to the surgical site, thus optimizing target 
engagement.  During closure, the surgical tissue is exposed and visible which allows for  
complete  and adequate delivery of CA-008 (and capsaicin)  to the potential areas where noxious 
pain is being generated.

mg, 10 mg or 15 mg  vs. placebo each in 100 mL of vehicle , randomized 1:[ADDRESS_676685] cohort 
and 2:1, respectively, in cohorts 2 and 3 , and an optional 4th cohort may be enrolled with a total 
N=24 randomized 1:[ADDRESS_676686] acebo at a dose between 5 mg and 15 mg as determined 
based upon results from cohorts #[ADDRESS_676687], the postoperative  assessments will be conducted in two parts:  
• Inpatient period  which  starts with completion of study treatment injection (T0) and continues 
through  96h (T96h ).    
• Outpatient period which begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through various follow 
up visits to day 29 (D29) or week 4 (W4) after surgery, or later if ne cessary for ongoing 
safety assessments.  Note that additional follow up visits could occur after D29/W4 to follow 
adverse events (AEs) to resolution or establishment of a new baseline.  
7.2. Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_521725], as defined:  
• 1 or more subjects with any grade 4 “related” TEAE in any of the categories shown in the 
table below  
• 2 or more subjects with the same grade 3 “related” TEAE in any of the categories shown  
in the table below  
Refer to Table 8 below for descriptions/definitions of AE severity grading.   Additional guidance 
on descriptions of AE grading may be found in Appendices I -K (Sections 17.9, 17.10  and 0). 
An external independent Safety Review Committee (SRC) will be consulted should a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_521726] a ppropriate to continue with dosing in the

9.1. Study Treatment  
Complete details of study drug packaging, storage, dispensation, preparation and tracking are 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
9.1.1.  CA-008 HCl Description  
CA-008, provided as the hydrochloride salt is a white solid, highly soluble in water.  It degrades 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_149175]~3.  Capsaicin is known to be irritating to mucous membranes when aerosolized 
and is a skin irritant . 
9.1.2.  Study Treatment Description  
The active drug product will be provided as CA-008 frozen concentrate s olution for injection in a 
1.0 mL vial with doses calculated as the freebase.   
The placebo comparator is identical in appearance.  
The proposed dose of CA -008 to be evaluated in the study are:  
• Cohort #1: CA -008 5 mg vs. placebo in 100 mL of vehicle  
• Cohort #2: CA -008 10 mg vs. placebo in 100 mL of vehicle  
• Cohort #3: CA -008 15 mg  vs. placebo in 100 mL of vehicle  
• Optional 4th cohort with a total N=24 randomized 1:1 to CA -008 or placebo at a dose 
between 5 mg and 15 mg as determined based upon results from cohorts #1 -3 
At time of use, the concentrate will be completely reconstituted in saline and used for treatment 
(see the Pha rmacy Manual).  All study treatment vials are unblinded and the dose (for CA -008) 
or placebo will be identified on the vial label .  The pharmacist reconstituting the study treatment 
for administration is unblinded, however the surgeon and other site partic ipants are blinded.  
9.1.3.  Study Treatment Storage  
Study treatments will be shipped to sites and stored at -20°C (-15°C to -30°C) until the day of 
surgery.   All study treatment  should be stored in a secured area and in accordance with the 
product labeling and all  applicable laws, regulations, and local/institutional requirements.  A 
description of storage conditions for all investigational products will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.

Version: [ADDRESS_676694] be maintained, including the dates 
shipments are received, the quantity of material received, the dates dispensed and the running 
inventory.  The unused quantities will be returned to the Sponsor’s drug supply vendor at the end 
of the trial. All unused supplies will be checked aga inst the drug accountability records during 
the study and/or at the end of the study. The Investigator or designee must maintain an inventory 
record of all dispensed rescue medications to subjects. Additional details are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
Only eligible subjects participating in the study will receive the study treatment . Only authorized 
research site staff may supply, prepare or administer the study treatment s. Once dispensed, study 
treatment  may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by [CONTACT_121641] r subjects.  
9.1.5.  Control of Study Treatment and Rescue Medication  
Mishandling, potential theft, significant loss of clinical supplies, including study treatments, 
systemic  analgesia medications and rescue medication s at the site, or other suspected diversion 
must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_676695] knowledge of the issue. If 
diversion is confirmed or suspected (e.g., excessive use of rescue medications), the study staff 
will be required to complete a clinical supply documentation form, including information related 
to situations in which  a subject sold drug or gave drug to a friend or relative, there is a 
discrepancy in drug accountability and suspected diversion, or a subject had drug stole n, or if 
there was diversion or theft by [CONTACT_149191].  
9.2. Other Interventions  
Note that if any standard of care drugs are unavailable, for example due to stock outages, 
available clinically equivalent alternatives may be substituted, particularly for the protocol -
specified drugs in Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_676696] IV hydro morphone 0.02 mg/kg  and IV 
acetaminophen 1 g (Ofirmev®, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals 2018) full prescribing information 
at http://ofirmev.com/ .  
During the surgery, ensure that each subject has received at least [ADDRESS_676697] IV hydromorphone 0.007  mg/kg. 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: [ADDRESS_676698] -anesthes ia care unit (PACU) during which 
time efficacy asssessments can begin once the subject is awake.  During th e PACU stay 
administer the subject IV fentanyl 25 -50 mcg q5 min prn for moderate -to-severe pain (≥ 4) as 
reported by [CONTACT_149186] 0 to 10 numer ical rating scale of current pain intensity (NRS).  
After discharge from the PACU, subjects are followed through T96h as an inpatient.  
From the time of discharge from the PACU through T12h administer IV hydromorphone 0. 2 to 
0.5 mg q 10-15 min prn for NRS ≥  4 as reported by [CONTACT_1766].  
After T12h, administer PO oxycodone 5 mg q2h prn moderate pain (NRS ≥ 4 and ≤ 6) or 10 mg 
q2h prn severe pain (NRS ≥ 7).   
Subjects will be encouraged to rescue only for moderate pain scores ( NRS ≥ 4), however rescue 
may be requested at any time and medication will be prov ided when requested.  
9.2.2.  Outpatient Analgesic Medications  
Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be instructed to take a 
combination of over -the-counter (OTC) analgesics at an appropriate dose per medical judgment 
to manage any residual or breakthrough postsurgical pain.  
If needed for pain management, acetaminophen up to 1000 mg prn tid /qid (3g daily maximum 
limit) will be recommended for subjects to self -administer (note that this medications will not be 
provided by [CONTACT_1034]).  
If a subject is still requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_149151] 12h prior to discharge from the inpatient unit 
(i.e., from T84h on regardless of whether discharge is delayed) , then prescribe no more than 9 
tablet s of oxycodone 5 mg (1 PO tid prn) per investigator discretion  for the initial outpatient 
period . 
Persistent pain or pain exacerbations during this period may suggest the need for an unscheduled 
in-person visit to assess the surgical site.  If such a situa tion occurs, the Investigator should use 
clinical discretion on adequacy of analgesic treatment, but capture this event as an AE and 
document any required treatments.  
9.3. Method of Assigning Subjects  to Treatment Groups  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias  in the assignment o f subject s to treatment s, to increase 
the likelihoo d that known and unknown subject  attributes (e.g., demographics, baseline 
characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of 
statistical compar isons across treatment groups.  
Subjects  who have provided written informed consent will be assigned a unique number in the 
screening process. This number will be used to identify the  subject  throughout the study.  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 53 of 105 In the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32734], 18 subjects will be ra ndomized to either the active medication  or placebo in a 
1:[ADDRESS_676699] and/or monitoring of this study will not 
be aware of the treatment group assignments.  Note that t he placebo is identical in appearance to 
CA-008. 
Under normal circumstances, the blind will not be broken until all participants have completed 
treatment. In case of emergency, and only if the information is required by [CONTACT_12534]’s safety in managing a medical condition, the treatment may be unblinded at the 
site by [CONTACT_2329]  a code break module.  The code break module will be provided by [CONTACT_95346]. If possible, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_373431]. Whenever a treatment sequence is prematurely unbli nded, the 
reason, date and time of the unblinding, and the individual who broke the blind must be 
documented. Individual code breaks will result in withdrawal of the participant from the study.  
It is assumed that the need to unblind a study subject’s treat ment assignment will occur in the 
setting of an SAE, and therefore, all procedures for the reporting of a SAE must be followed . 
9.5. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All non -study medications, including prescription, over -the-counter, or herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], used by 
[CONTACT_373432] 30 days prior to Screening and throughout the study. The 
Investigator will determine if the prior/concomitant medication(s) affect the subject’s eligibility 
to participate or continue to participate in the study.  
On a case -by-case basis, the Investigator is permitted to allow the use of some concomitant 
medications, for example, to treat an AE, as long as the Investigator determines that the 
medication will not affect the subject ’s safety or study integrity. Wherever possible, the 
Investigator should obtain approval from the Medical Monitor prior to administering the 
medication.

Upon completion of surgery, subjects will be observed for 96-hours in the clinic. AEs will be 
assessed during the surgery.  
10.1.3.  Surgery Phase : Administration of Study Medication  Into the Surgical Site  
The “surgical site” is defined as the area extending approximately 2 -3 cm in all directions 
(lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the incision  and surrounding tissues which may be 
affected by [CONTACT_521752] .  Study treatment is to  be administered 
intraoperatively as a single administration via “surgical site” infiltration  prior to wound closure .  
A total of 100 mL of study treatment will be infiltrated into the deep peri -incisional 
subcutaneous tissues  and rectus fascia within the exposed incision surfaces.    
10.1.4.  Inpatient Phase : Time 0  (Post -Surgery) to Day 4  (Discharge)  
Time 0 is defined as the time of completion of study drug administration. Following surgery, 
subjects will be transferred to the appropriate recovery unit where they will undergo an 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 57 of 105 assessment of safety and efficacy over the next 96 hours. The schedule of assessments are as 
follows:  
• Subjects with inadequately controlled pain may request rescue at any time; however, subjects 
will be encouraged to receive rescue medication only w ith an N RS ≥ 4.        
• Pain intensity (assessed with NRS):   
o During the inpatient stay, beginning with the PACU admission and after the subject is 
awake: assess the NRS at rest at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours , and every 4 
hours (if awake at time of assessment) until discharge from the inpatient unit.  Time 
windows: for T0.5 to T2 (±5 min) and from T4 onward (±15 min).  
o Pain scores may be skipped between the hours of midnight and [ADDRESS_676704] is asleep at these times.  
o Pain intensity (NRS) will be completed at the time of rescue medication request ( ±15 
minutes).      
o During the inpatient stay, starting on postoperative day 1: each morning on arising  at 
0800h (±2h) and each evening at 2000h (±2h)  document the NRS at rest and on arising 
from a recumbent  position to a sitting or standing position.  Actual assessment times  
must be documented.   These assessments are in addition to the time -specific NRS 
assessments at rest .  If however these twice daily assessments coincide with timed 
assessments of NRS at rest, then the time assessment at rest is used in place of the twice 
daily assessments.  
• Vital signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR]) and temperature are 
assessed together  at screening, D0 prior to surgery, post -surgery at T1, T2, T4, T6, T12, and 
T24h, and every 8 hours thereafter until T96h, and as an outpatient on D8/W1, D15/W2, and 
D29/W4 or later if necessary.  Assessments between the hours of 00:00 and 06:[ADDRESS_676705] is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; however, two conse cutive assessments may not be skipped.  
The allowable window is ±[ADDRESS_676706] -surgery, and ±15 minutes for 
all other times.  
• Targeted Physical exam: 96  (±4) hours after the administration of study medication  (prior to 
discharge from the unit).  Weight is included at the 96 hour assessment.  
• ECG: 24 (±2) hours after the administration of study medication.  
• Surgical Site assessment: 48 (±2) and 96 (±4) hours after the administration of study 
medication. If the investigator determines there are atypi[INVESTIGATOR_521729], a digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_521730]  (if subject has 
consented to digital photography) . 
• Neurosensory testing  of the surgical area: 48 (±2) and 96 (±4) hours after the adminis tration 
of study medication.  
• Clinical laboratory tests: T96h (±4h) prior to discharge from the unit.

T1, T1.5, T2, T2.5, T3, T4, T6, T8, T12, T16, T24 , T30, T36 and T48h for a total of 20 
samples).   
• 24h urine collection in two aliquots: end of surgery to T6h and T6h to T24h.    
• Subject completes Patient Global Evaluation (PGE) assessment at T96h (±4) prior to 
discharge  
• Investigator completes Investigator Global Evaluation (IGE) assessment at T96 (±4 ) prior to 
discharge .  Note that the IGE may be performed by [CONTACT_521747] -investigator.  
• Record rescue medication consumption and concomitant medications  throughout the 
inpatient period  and record any prescriptions for opi[INVESTIGATOR_521731].  Also document any additional  
prescriptions if needed . 
• Record AEs throughout the inpatient period (Section 17.11  Appendix K may be useful to the 
investigator for assessing systemic [general] AEs)   
After completing the assessments through T96h, the diary for at -home use will be reviewed and 
subjects will be discharged from the study center with diary to record pain assessments and pain 
medication at home.  Subjects will be provided routine standard of care for pain management 
after discharge from the study center.  Subjects will be instructed to return to the study center on 
Day 8 [ ±1 day] for follow -up assessments.  
10.1.5.  Outpatient Phase : Days 4 (after discharge)  through 8:  
In their diary, subjects will assess their pain intensity (at rest and after arising from recumbency) 
once in the morning (08:00 ±4 hours), and once in the evening (20:00 ±4 hours) using the NRS  
(these are two sep arate scores “at rest” and “on arising” obtained  twice daily) . Subjects will also 
record any medication they take to treat their pain.  
Subjects will return to the study center on Day 8 [ ±1 day] for the following assessments:

10.2.2.  Subject Withdrawal  
A subject is free to withdraw his/her consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time 
for any reason. A subject’s participation must therefore be terminated immediately upon his/her 
request,  and the reason(s) for discontinuation appropriately documented.  
A subject may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
▪ Safety reasons, including AEs or significant concomitant illness, injury, or urgent 
surgeries/procedures that wo uld, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant extent, require discontinuation of study drug, or both  
▪ At the request of the Sponsor, regulatory agency, or Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
▪ Subject is lost to  follow -up 
▪ Subject treatment allocation is unblinded (i.e., individual code break; Section 9.4) 
▪ Death of subject  
A subject may also be discontinued from the study, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or 
Sponsor, for any of the following reasons:  
▪ Subject refuses or is unable to adhere to the study protocol  
▪ Major protocol violation  
▪ Pregnancy  
▪ Use of unacceptable concomitant medication(s)  
▪ It is not  considered in the best interest of the subject to continue  
▪ Administrative reasons (e.g., termination of enrollment or study)  
The Investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who discontinue from the study prior to 
completion; the reason(s) for stud y discontinuation will be documented. In the event that a 
subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to 
obtain and record the reason(s) for withdrawal in as much detail as possible, although the subject 
is not obligated to provide such a reason.  
Subjects who elect to discontinue participation prior to D8 (W1) will be considered to have 
terminated as of the date of their election, however they will be asked to return to the site one 
time, if willing and at their convenience, to ensure wound healing.  If a subject refuses to 
complete early termination/Follow -up procedures or continued data collection, this information

will be assessed per the Schedule Assessments.    
10.3.16.  12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
12-Lead EC Gs will be performed per the Schedule of Assessments after the subject  has been 
resting in a recumbent/supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes. The ECG variables will include 
ventricular heart rate and the PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals. ECGs will  be signed and dated 
by a medically -qualified individual to confirm review of the ECG and verify whether any 
abnormalities are clinically significant. In general, abnormal, clinically significant ECGs are 
expected to be associated with an item recorded in medical history (e.g., at Screening) or with an 
AE (if it occurred post study treatment) .  Note that for QTc, clinically significant changes in 
ECG (using  QTCf , should be <450 msec  for male subjects  / < 470 msec for female subjects .  
Clinically significant changes in ECG are: an increase of QT cF of 30msec or greater, as well as 
any other changes deemed by [CONTACT_521753]. 
10.3.17.  Physical Examination  
A complete PE including all major body systems (HEENT,  neurologic , cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal, dermatologic and musculoskeletal systems) will be performed at Screening .  A 
focused interim or targeted PE will be performed pre -surgery and after surgery  during the inpatient 
and outpatient periods  as per Table 1.  
Body weight (kg ), in indoor clothing, but without shoes , will be measured at Scre ening  and 96 
hours.  Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured, and BMI will be calculated at Screening 
only. BMI shall be calculated as kg/m2.  The site should use NIH website BMI calculator 
(available at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi -m.htm . 
10.3.18.  Surgical  Site Assessment   
The s urgical site should be assessed per the Schedule of Assessments  to determine if any site 
related AEs have occurred.   The investigator will evaluate their satisfaction with the healing of 
the wound during this Surgical Site assessment using an 11 -point scale (0 -10) where a score of 0 
is “Completely unsatisfied,” and a score of 10 is “Completely satisfied.” (Section 17.6 Appendix 
F).  Assessments will also be performed  at each of the Follow -up visits  or at the time of early 
discontinuation. When assessed on Day 29, if the Investigator observes insufficient wound or bone 
healing  or to ensure an ongoing AE has resolved , the subject will be scheduled for a follow -up 
visit.  
If  there are skin reactions atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84699], e.g., more than expected erythema, 
drainage, bruising or hematoma, induration, swelling or other skin changes, they should be 
documented as AEs, graded for severity and followed regularly until re solution or establishment

11.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The following definitions, developed in accordance with the [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Clinical Safety 
Data Management Guidance for Industry, E2A, will be used to identify AEs  in this study.  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., includi ng an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or increase in severity of a preexisting abnormality, temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
A “suspected adverse reaction” means any AE for which there is a reasonable  possibility that the 
drug caused the event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.   
11.1.1.  Relationship  to Study Treatment  
A qualified investigator must make the determination of relationship to the investigational 
product for each AE.  The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event m ay have been caused by [CONTACT_104841].   
 
Causality 
Category  Description  
Unlikely related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration which  makes a causal 
relationship improbable or if other drugs, chemicals or underlying 
disease provide more plausible  explanations.  
While temporal sequence may be an important factor in determining 
causality: i.e., whether the observed reaction or event began after the 
study treatment, it may well be that the surgery, anesthesia, a concurrent 
medical condition or concomitant medications administered during or 
after surgery were more likely than not to be responsible for the AE.  
The investigator should use clinical judgment to evaluate the evidence 
and determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that study 
treatment actually cause d the AE or whether based upon the evidence it 
is more likely that something else is responsible.  If the former, choose 
“possibly related” and if the latter, “unlikely related.”   
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 71 of 105 For the purpose of this protocol, the term “unlikely related” will be 
consi dered an AE not related to study treatment.  
Possibly related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration, which also may be 
explained by [CONTACT_149196].  In such 
cases, if the investigator using clinical judgment is unable to rule out a 
reasonable possibility that study treatment was partly responsible, then 
choose “possibly related.”  
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has possible rela tionship 
to study treatment will be defined as a “Suspected Adverse Drug 
Reaction”.   
Probably related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration, in which the investigator 
has de termined that the event is unlikely to be attributed to other 
factors.    
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has probable relationship 
to study treatment will be defined as an “Adverse Drug Reaction”.  
 
11.1.2.  Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs must be entered on the AE CRF, regardless of causality or severity. AEs include new 
AEs, worsening baseline conditions, clinically significant laboratory findings, disease -related 
signs and symptoms that were not present at baseline, and any events or findings tha t the 
Investigator feels are clinically significant.  
Disease -related signs and symptoms that are present at baseline should not be recorded as AEs 
unless they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.  
Information collected concerning AEs will include th e following:  
▪ Name [CONTACT_12581]  
▪ Onset date  
▪ Resolution date  
▪ Severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe or potentially life -threatening)  
▪ Relationship to study treatment  
▪ Action and outcome  
▪ Seriousness of event  
All SAEs will be documented and followed from the time  the subject has signed the ICF until 
D29±2 after the completion of surgery.  All SAEs and non -serious AEs will be documented and 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: [ADDRESS_676718]’s medical record, unless the AE is due to a 
study -related procedure (such as phlebotomy), in which case  it will be recorded as a non -
treatment emergent AE.  Serious AEs and AEs that have been designated as possibly related to 
study treatment will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
11.1.3.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE or reaction is any adverse dru g experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
▪ Death  
▪ Is life -threatening (at the time of the event)  
▪ Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
▪ Results in persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity  
▪ Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in an offspring)  
▪ An Important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
All AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a pre -existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521738] ≥ [ADDRESS_676719] be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF: study specified hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], short -term administrative 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84748], tests or treatments of conditions that would not otherwise 
constitute an SAE, elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event Reportin g 
Serious AEs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_676720] is receiving study treatment and within 14 days 
following the study completion visit (or 21 days following an ET if app licable) are reportable 
within 24 hours. During this follow -up period beyond study completion or after an ET, only 
those SAEs considered to be possibly related to study treatment should be reported within 24 
hours.  
The procedure for reporting an SAE is as follows:  
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 73 of 105 ▪ All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of discovery) by [CONTACT_521754].  Calls related to SAEs should first be directed to the CRO 
Medical Monitor or designee.  
o CRO Medical Monitor: Jon Ruckle, MD  
o 24/[ADDRESS_676721]: [PHONE_1987] /  (253) 448 -8690  
o SAE Reporting email: MedicalMonitorCA -[EMAIL_9978]  
▪ The Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor is available for questions about safety -related issues:  
Mike A. Royal, MD JD MBA; 858 -204-1112 or mike@concentric analgesics.com.  
▪ The initial report should include all information known at the time of the report (additional 
information can be reported as discovered). Do not delay the initial reporting in order to 
obtain resolution or follow -up information.  
▪ The site wi ll enter into the electronic database (or fax, if the database cannot be accessed for 
any reason) an SAE report, or similar form, that includes the following information, as 
available:  
o Subject ID  
o Basic demographic information (age, gender, weight)  
o Outcomes  attributed to the event (death, life -threatening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [new or 
prolonged], disability, congenital anomaly, required medical intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment/damage, etc.)  
o Onset date and severity of the event  
o Brief description of the event including frequency and severity of symptoms leading 
to diagnosis  
o List of relevant test results and laboratory data  
o Any other relevant history  
o Whether the study treatment was discontinued  
o Investigator ’s assessment of causality  
The CRO Medical Monitor  or another representative of the Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_521755]. All SAEs will be 
entered on the AE CRF. The same nomenclature should be used on both the SAE report and the 
AE CRF.  The Investigator is responsible for the complete and timely reporting of all SAEs to 
the Sponsor (or designee), reporting pertinent follow -up information on the SAE, and notifying 
the appropriate IRB of the occurrence of and details surroundin g the event. In the event there is a 
question as to whether the AE is serious, the event should be reported.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 74 of 105 11.2. Severity Grading for AEs  
Grading the severity of AEs is per investigator discretion (the guidance reflected in Sections 
17.9, 17.10  and 17.11 ; Appendices I, J and K may be helpful ).   Additionally,  the following 
general guideline may be helpful : 
• Grade 1 (mild) = asymptomatic or mild symptoms requiring no treatment, only clinical or 
diagnostic observation  
• Grade 2 (moderate) = event or symptoms limit age -appropriate activities of daily living  
(ADLs)  more than is expected from the surgery itself , requiring minimal treatment or 
local noninvasive intervention indicated .   
• Grade 3 (severe) = medically -significant but not immediately  life-threatening, 
significantly limiting of self -care ADLs, requiring of medical treatment and may require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318].   
11.3. Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant at any time during the study, the Investigator must notify 
the CRO Medical Monitor or designee within [ADDRESS_676722] through the pregnan cy term, and report to the 
CRO Medical Monitor or designee the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal or neonatal 
outcome. Information on the status of the mother and the child will be forwarded to the CRO 
Medical Monitor or designee. Any premature t ermination of the pregnancy will also be reported 
on this form. Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an SAE, 
any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
recorded as an AE  and will be followed as such. A spontaneous abortion is considered to be an  
SAE.

This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. To ensure compliance, the Sponsor or design ee may conduct a quality assurance 
audit, as outlined in Section 12.2.  
Actions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with the 
Investigato r and study personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents 
with appropriate instructions for use (where applicable); the internal audit of source data 
according to GCP and internal procedures to ensure their accuracy, completeness,  and 
verifiability; as well as the periodic site monitoring by [CONTACT_1034]. The Sponsor or designee will 
review source documents for accuracy and completeness during on -site monitoring visits and 
after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be  resolved with the Investigator, as 
appropriate.  
Significant and/or repeated non -compliance will be investigated and remedial action instituted 
when appropriate. Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in investigational site 
termination and re gulatory authority notification.

ethical considerations, authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and/or 
an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including the drug storage area, study 
drug stocks, drug accountabilit y records, participant charts and source documents, and other 
records related to study conduct. The purpose of the Sponsor audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether th e study -related activities were conducted, and data recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, the site’s standard operating procedures, GCP 
guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirement s. The Investigator sho uld

SAMPLE SIZE  
13.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The sections of the Statistical Considerations describe the statistical m ethods to be used to 
analyze the efficacy and safety.  These methods may be revised and updated due to rea sons such 
as regulatory requirements or need for further clarifications.  The final analysis will be 
documented in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that must be finalized before database 
lock.  The SAP will include details on how variables will be derived, how missing data will be 
handled, and how data will be presented as well as the details on statistical methods to be used 
for safety and effi cacy analyses.  The final clinical study report will discuss deviations from the 
SAP, if any.  
13.2. Sample Size Justification  
Given the uncertainty in estimating a sample size for C -ABD surgery, the data from the current 
study will be used to determine the sampl e size for a subsequent parallel design study selecting 
one or more optimal doses of CA -[ADDRESS_676723] of care for 
abdominoplasty . 
13.3. Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• The Safety P opulation will include all subjects who received any part of a dose of study 
treatment.   
• The PK Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of study treatment and 
complete all PK assessments.  
• The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects as randomized to study 
treatment.   
Membership in analysis populations will be determined before unblinding.  
Subjects who elect to discontinue study participation (early termination or ET) afte r 
randomization but prior to receiving study treatment will be replaced.   
Subjects who elect to ET after receiving study treatment will not be replaced, however those who 
ET during the inpatient phase of the study, will be asked to continue with assessmen ts through 
T96h if they have not elected to withdraw from all aspects of study participation.

13.5. Study Subjects and Demographics  
13.5.1.  Disposition and Withdrawals  
The numbers of subjects randomized, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. The number of subjects in each 
analysis po pulation will be reported.  
13.5.2.  Protocol Deviations  
Major protocol deviations will be classified and documented before database lock and will be 
discussed in the CSR.  All protocol deviations, whether  minor  or major , will be presented in a 
data listing.  
13.5.3.  Demogra phics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, race, weight, and height) will be 
summarized for each treatment group and for the overall population by [CONTACT_9086]. 
Medical history and clini cal laboratory tests will be listed.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], by [CONTACT_149199], classified using World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic  Chemical classes and preferred terms .

Since this is a single dose s tudy, study  drug administration will be summarized in terms of total 
exposure  by [CONTACT_82187].  
13.5.5.  General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) 
using the descriptive statistics n, mean, SD, median, and range (minimum, and maximum).  
Categorical assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) using 
frequency counts and rates of occurrence (%).  Changes from baseline for continuous outcomes 
will be presented as their corresponding continuous measures for post -baseline visits.  All study 
data will be listed by [CONTACT_1570], subject and time point.  
No preliminary rounding will be performed; rounding will only occur after the analysis.  Means 
and medians will be presented with one more decimal place than the precision of the data.  
Standard deviations will be presented with two m ore decimal places than the precision of the 
data.  Percentages will be presented with one decimal place.  A percentage of 0% or 100% will 
be reported as 0% or 100%, respectively.  Minimums and maximums will be presented with the 
same precision as the orig inal data.  
All analyses will be performed using the SAS System® version 9.3 or higher. The domain 
(Study data tabulation Model [SDTM]) and analysis (Analysis Data Model [ADaM]) data sets 
will be taken as input to the SAS programs that generate the report -ready tables, figures and 
listings. The submission ready SDTM and ADaM data sets will be provided to the sponsor along 
with display deliveries. The specifications for the domain data sets and analysis data sets will be 
provided in a separate document.  
The following conventions will be used throughout the study analysis:  
• Time T0 is the time of completion of study treatment administration.  
• Day of surgery is defined as D0  
• Assessment visit times are defined by [CONTACT_5586] T0 /D0. 
• Baseline value is defined as the last v alid measurement prior to beginning study treatment 
administration.  
• Change from baseline is defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value.  
• Duration of an AE will be computed in days for AEs lasting longer than 24 hours, and as 
hours for AEs lasting l ess than 24 hours.  Duration in hours will be calculated as the stop 
date/time of the event minus the start date/time.  Duration in days will be calculated by [CONTACT_149201] +[ADDRESS_676725] in the 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: 28 January  2019        Page 80 of 105 database, whichever is later.  Missing dates will be imputed as described in the Study’s 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
• The number of days in the study is computed as: [Date of study completion or withdrawal 
minus the date of study drug administration (Day 1)] + 1.  
• If duplicate values are obtained at a given visit (e.g., repeated vital sign measurements), the 
last value will be used unless it is noted that the measurement was in error for that v alue. 
Values that compromise interpretation will not be used in summaries (e.g., values that were 
obtained post -dose will not be summarized as pre -dose values).  
13.5.6.  Analysis of Efficacy Measures  
All efficacy endpoints (e.g., NRS scores), will be summarized ove r time by [CONTACT_149202].  
AUC calculations will be done using the standard trapezoidal rule  
AUC  =     ∑ (𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+1
2)𝑥
𝑖=0 ∗ (𝑇𝑖+1− 𝑇𝑖) 
Where:  NRS i = NRS at time i, and (T i+1 – Ti) is the Time difference in minutes between time i 
and time i+1.  A similar calculation and handling of missing data will be performed for the NRS 
scores with position changes.  
Missing NRS will be handled as discussed in the Study’s SAP.   
The AUC analyses will be presented in a summary table with standard summary statistics for 
each dose cohort and placebo as well as active vs. placebo mean  difference s, standard errors, 
confidence intervals and comparison p -values  as appropriate . Comparison s of individual dose 
cohorts for dose response may also be presented for certain secondary AUC endpoints.  
The AUC analyses will be presented in a summary table with standard summary statistics for 
each treatment group mean differences standard errors, conf idence intervals and comparison p -
values as appropriate.   
Mean NRS scores over time (in -clinic and diary) will be graphed over time by  [CONTACT_1570] .  
NRS over time by [CONTACT_521756].  The individual 
NRS and the computed AUC variables will be listed for all individual subjects.   
In this study, subjects are permitted to take rescue medication for analgesia.  It is expected 
subjects randomized to placebo arm will take rescue medication more often.  During both 
inpatient and outpatient portions of the studies, the subjects will be instructed to record NRS  
immediately prior to taking rescue medication.  
For subjects who take rescue, the pre -rescue pain score will be used to impute scheduled 
assessments.   Intermittent missing pain scores (due to subject sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc.) will not be imputed, 
 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204  Confidential  
 
 
Version: [ADDRESS_676726].  
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable using different methods of imputation for 
rescue me dication may also  be performed.    
Additional  sensitivity analysis with different missing value imputation methods for subjects who 
drop out of the study may also be performed.    
All imputation methods for pain intensity will be documented in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
All efforts will be made to minimize missing data .  These efforts will include the following:  
• Subjects are required to consent continuous data collection even after subjects 
discontinue the study medication;  
• Continue data collection after subjects taking rescue medication;  
• Establish robust efficacy data collection procedures.  
With the procedures above, it is expected that the missing would be minimal.  Missing at random 
is expected to be a reasonable assumption and the prim ary analyses  are expected to be sufficient 
for this dose escalation study. Additional s ensitivity analyses will be performed to support robust 
conclusion s, if warranted and details are presented in a detailed SAP prior to database lock .  
For subjects who t ake rescue  medication a windowed last pain score carried forward (wLOCF) 
will be used.  The pre -rescue pain score will be used to impute scheduled  assessments for 30 
minutes following the rescue use when IV fentanyl is used, 2 hours when IV hydromorphone is  
used, and 4 hours  when PO oxycodone is used . Intermittent missing pain scores (due to subject 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc.) will not  be imputed, and AUC will be calculated based on non -missing values.  For 
subjects who drop out  of the study prior to Day 15, scheduled assessments  will first be imputed 
using the worst prior pain score carried forward (WOCF).  As sensitivity analyses, the AUC will 
also be calculated where assessments after drop out will be imputed using LOCF, using the last 
scheduled non missing pain score  prior to drop out, and the median scores for the remainder of 
the group continuing in the study, without imputation using actual data . 
For secondary continuous efficacy endpoints, similar methods as the primary analysis will be 
used.  For categorical endp oints, when assessments are imputed for data after a subject 
discontinues from the study, a WOCF method will be used.

Version: 28 January  2019        Page 82 of 105 Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable using different methods of imputation for 
rescue medication may also be performed.  Additional sensitivity analysis with different missing 
value imputation methods for subjects who drop out of the study may also be performed.   All 
imputation methods for pain intensity will be documented in the SAP.  
13.5.7.  Analysis of Safety  
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the Safety Population (as defined in 
Section  13.2).  
Safety will be assessed through treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs); hematologic, biochemical, 
and urinal ysis laboratory parameters; vital signs measurements ; ECGs; physical exam, surgical 
site and neurosensory assessments .  
No formal statistical comparisons will be performed for safety endpo ints. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) reporting system. Treatment -emergent AEs are 
defined as any of the following:  
▪ Non-serious AEs w ith onset on the date of treatment with the study drug through Day [ADDRESS_676727];  
▪ Serious AEs with onset on the date of treatment with the study drug through [ADDRESS_676728]; 
▪ AEs that start before the start of treatment but increase in severity or relationship at the time 
of or following the start of treatment through Day [ADDRESS_676729]. 
The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be displayed for each treatment group 
by [CONTACT_9315]. Additionally, TEAEs will be tabulated for each treatment group by 
[CONTACT_373436]. A listing of SAEs will be provided if applicable.  
13.5.8.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluat ions 
For continuous laboratory parameters, descriptive statistics will be presented for the value at 
each assessment time  and for the changes from baseline by [CONTACT_1570].  
Additionally, clinical laboratory parameters will be categorized as low, normal , or high 
according to laboratory range specifications and the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category will be presented in shift tables.

along with c orresponding normal ranges.  
13.5.9.  Vital Signs  and ECG  
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual values and 
changes from Baseline will be calculated for vital signs and ECG .  Detailed description of the 
analysis will be included in the Study SAP.  
The incidence of abnormal ECG findings will be summarized for each visit.  
13.5.10.  Physical Examination Findings  
Physical and Surgical S ite examination data will be presented in the listings . Abnormal or 
clinically significant physical exam and surgical site findings will be recorded as AEs.

Neurosensory testing should be performed in an area approximately [ADDRESS_676741] the investigator or designee in performing  neurosensory 
testing.  
• Monofilament (von Frey) Testing:  For this examination, the filament should initially be 
prestressed (4 -6 perpendicular applications to the dorsum of the examiner’s first finger). 
The filament is then applied perpendicularly at the location to be assessed and briefly, 
(<1 second) with even pressure.  When the filament bends, the force of [ADDRESS_676742], whose eyes are closed, is asked to respond yes if he / she feels 
the filament.  Eight correct respon ses out of 10 applications is considered normal: one to 
seven correct responses indicate reduced sensation and no correct responses translates 
into absent sensation.  
• Testing for Allodynia: testing should be performed  at the location to be assessed using a 
foam brush but allodynia may also be a finding during the monofilament testing .   

Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-204               Confidential  
 
Version: [ADDRESS_676743] reports the stimulus as 
the same as the control  area then sensation will be reported as normal. If sensation is less than 
the control  area then sensation will be reported as reduced, and if sensation is not felt as a ll then 
it will be reported as absent.

(DoD ) Non -Valvular Atrial Fibrillation Patient Population -A 
Retrospective Database Analy sis
Rationale and 
background:Due to the emergence of multiple pharmaceutical alternatives to 
warfarin, ph ysicians in the US are faced with many  
anticoagula tion options. To help inform their decisions phy sicians 
want to know the comparative safet y and efficacy  profiles of 
these new agents.
Now that real world experience with dabigatran for NVAF 
patients has accrued, the safet y and effectiveness for dabigatran , 
rivaroxaban, and api[INVESTIGATOR_65610].
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. (BI PI) has an 
opportunity  to collaborate with DoD to conduct comparative 
safet y and effectiveness studies of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, a nd 
api[INVESTIGATOR_65611] y existing real world data from DoD’s 
claims and EMR data.
Research 
question and 
objectives:To assess the safet y and effectiveness of newl y initiated 
dabigatran among patients diagnosed with  NVAF in comparison 
to newly  initiated rivaroxaban users and newl y initiated api[INVESTIGATOR_65612] (2) separate study  cohorts :

reduce popu lation sizes further but feasibility  estimates provide 
strong support for necessary  sample size.
Data analysis: The target population will include OAC treatment naïve NVAF 
patients with at least one prescription claim for dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban or 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. For each patient treated with a NOAC, 
the date of the first NOAC prescription (index exposure) will 
serve as the index date. Only  those patients whose index date 
occurs between the respective study  periods will be included. The 
12-month period pr ior to the index date will be defined as the pre -
index period. The patients will be required to have a NVAF 
diagnosis in the pre -index period (including index date).
Study period NOT including pre- index period:
Dabigatran vs. Rivaroxaban: July  1, 2011 to June 30, 
2016 
Dabigatran vs. Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]: December 28, 2012 to June 30, 
2016
Study period including pre- index period:
Dabigatran vs. Rivaroxaban: July  1, 2010 to June 30, 2016 
Dabigatran vs. Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]: December 28, [ADDRESS_71417] dose for NOAC’s:
Dabigatran 150 mg , twice daily , total daily  dose of 300 
mg
Rivaroxaban 20 mg , once daily , total daily  dose of 20 mg
Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 5 mg , twice daily , total daily  dose of 10 mg
Length of Follow -up:
The post -index follow -up period will begin the day  following the 
NOAC index date and end on whichever of the following occurs 
earliest:
The day  of discontinuation of the index NOAC exposure;
The day  before a switch to an anticoagulant different from 
the index exposure;
The day  before a change in dose for the index NOAC;
The end of continuous eligibility  of a patient in the health 
plan (disenrollment) ;
The end of the stud y observation period; or
The date of death of the patient.
The last date of calculated day s supplied if treatment gap

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_71418] -01(4.0)>[ADDRESS_71419] will be ascertained through 
ICD-9 and ICD -10 diagnosis codes, in combination with 
procedures and medic ations, as appropriate to the study  protocol 
definitions.  
To account for potential selection bias, the study  cohorts 
(dabigatran/rivaroxaban and dabigatran/api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) will be 
matched on their baseline characteristics using the propensit y 
score matching ( PSM) method.  The PSM aims to balance the two 
treatment groups on baseline demographics, health plan ty pe and 
clinical characteristics. The feasibility  of PSM will be evaluated 
based on available sample size and descriptive results. I f patient 
characterist ics between dabigatran/rivaroxaban and 
dabigatran/api[INVESTIGATOR_65614] y different, i.e., less 
than 50% of patients in the dabigatran group can be matched to
therivaroxaban or api[INVESTIGATOR_65615], then the study  
design will be re -evaluated before proceeding to analy sis. The 
Nearest Neighbor method of propensit y score matching within a 
caliper of 0.10 -0.20 (depending on resulting sample sizes) of the 
standard deviation of the estimated logit will be used to select the 
matched samples.
The propensit y score models will include baseline variables 
known to be confounders or factors related to the outcome only ,
including age, gender, health plan ty pe, geographic region, month 
and y ear of index date, Charlson comorbidity  index (CCI ), stroke 
risk scores (i.e. CHADS 2or CHA 2DS 2-VASc), bleeding risk 
scores (i.e., modified HAS- BLED), specified comorbid 
conditions and medication use , based on literature and clinical 
relevance ,as well as empi[INVESTIGATOR_12484] (top diagnoses, procedures, 
etc.) that may  account for possible unforeseen confounding.

Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is an abnormal heart rh ythm characterized by  [CONTACT_65635]. Patients may  experience shortness of breath, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], fainting, or 
chest pain. Anticoagulants have long been used to decrease the risk of stroke in NVAF 
patients and the efficacy  of blood thinners have
been well studied. 
Until recentl y, warfarin, which was FDA -approved in 1954, was the only  drug on the market 
used to prevent stroke in patients with NVAF. In the last few years, the FDA has approved 
three NOACs – dabigatran, rivaroxaban , and api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] . All three NOACs have shown 
efficacy  in reducing the overall risk of stroke, but, can also increase the risk for bleeding .
In several clinical trials that included more than 50,[ADDRESS_71426] for man y days after it is discontinued , potentially  causing a slower resolution 
to bleeding events.
There is still an unmet need to truly  understand utilization patterns of NOAC and non- NOAC 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as well as outcomes and safet y associated with NOACs when compared to one 
another.  Man y traditional insurance plans do not allow for lengthy follow -up periods, as 
patients tend to f requently  switch insurance coverage and in some cases providers. Therefore, 
the ability  to assess longitudinal real -world data in a large patient population poses an unmet 
need in the medical community .  The DoD patient population is well suited to help ta ckle 
these real -world issues due to its “closed loop sy stem”.  DoD beneficiaries have much longer 
treatment durations and follow -up periods because beneficiaries tend to have longer coverage 
periods when compared to traditional commercial insurance plans. 
DoD , in collaboration with
 have successfully  published prior findings in a reputable 
medical journal comparing dabigatran and warfarin in an NVAF patient population (1).  That 
study  aimed to mitigate many  of the potential biases and limitations of observational studies 
via vigorous methodology including inclusion of only  newl y treated patients, propensity  
score matching (PSM) to derive cohorts for comparison, and adjustm ents of covariates if 
needed based on imbalances left following PSM.  Additionally , rules were pre- specified to 
ensure that PSM anal yses of outcomes were onl y performed if there were enough patients per 
cohort to support a robust analy sis.  
The opportuni ty to expand on our initial study  by [CONTACT_65636] a large 
patient population with a relatively long duration of continuous follow -up provides an 
outstanding opportunity  to assess safet y and outcomes in a real -world setting.  Results f rom

9.4 DATA SOURCES
The study  will use the Military  Health Sy stems (MHS) database .
The US Do Doperates the largest cradle -to-grave health care database in the US. The military  
database has over 30 billion archived records, including 5 billion online records spanning 
Boehringer Ingelheim Page 27of 90
Protocol for non -interventional studies based on existing data
BI Study Number 1160.274 c14336616- 01
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_71442] -01(4.0)over 11 years for EMRs, 20 years of ePrescribing, and decades of prescription, inp atient, and 
outpatient data. Its size increases b y 230,000 outpatient encounters and 2,700 inpatient 
admissions every  day. As a single
-payer, full y budgeted $[ADDRESS_71443] patients, thus positioning 
the DOD as a dy namic platform for patient adherence. It is completel y free of expense for 
patients utilizing military treatment facil ities (MTF) and clinics. These data are commercially  
available onl y through .
The MHS provides [ADDRESS_71444] care accounts for approximately 40% of the total care provided, with the 
balance being purchased from civilian providers. All the administrative events generated b y 
either a direct care or purchased care inpatient or outpatient encounter are centrally  processed 
into the MDR . Examples of the data recorded in such encounters include patient demographic 
data, provider information (provider ID, special ty, facility ), diagnostic codes (I CD-9 codes 
for outpatient; diagnosis-related group [DRG] codes for inpatient), and Current Procedural 
Terminology  (CPT) codes for any  procedures. Extensive information regarding the patient, 
including age, race, and gender , is also stored within the MDR via connections with the 
Defense Eligibility  Enrollment Reporting Sy stem (DEERS). The military  utilizes an 
electronic medication sy stem called the Pharmacy  Data Transaction Sy stem (PDTS). All the 
prescribing details of both direct care and purchased care outpatient medication orders, 
including mail order, are electronically  coded, including the prescribed drug name [CONTACT_65651] , 
dose, quantity , refills, and prescribing provider. All PDTS information is fed into the MDR. 
In additi on to feeding data into the MDR, direct care encounters conducted at MTFs utilize 
the military ’s EMR s ystem, called AHLTA. This robust EMR sy stem stores the entire 
encounter electronically  and is powered b y the MEDCIN®Engine; AHLTA is therefore 
designed w ith extensive variables documenting the individual components of an encounter, 
including s ymptoms, vital signs, history , phy sical exams, laboratory  and radiology  results, 
diagnostic codes, procedure codes, pharmacy  orders, and other orders such as specialt y 
consultation. The AHLTA dataset for each encounter is stored within the Clinical Data 
Repository  (CDR). Aspects of the CDR feed into the MDR, including vitals and lab results.

9.5 STUDY SIZE
Given the non- interventional design, the stud y’s objective is not to demonstrate superiorit y of 
dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban or api[INVESTIGATOR_65620] -world estimates of the 
comparative effectiveness and safet y of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, a nd api[INVESTIGATOR_34219] a large US 
population of NVAF patients. Therefore, the planned anal yses are descriptive in nature and 
results of the statistical tests are to be interpreted in an exploratory  manner.
For each treatment comparison, the available sample size is determined by  [CONTACT_65644]- specified time window and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and not by  [CONTACT_65645]. Therefore, the 
purpose of the power assessments described in this sectio n is to illustrate the precision of the 
effect estimates that can be achieved given the feasible sample size. The primary safet y 
outcome of major bleeding was used for the power assessments, for which an annual event 
rate of 3.1% for the dabigatran patient s and a mean follow -up duration of 0.[ADDRESS_71447] with α=0.05 and a 10% loss of dabigatran patients during the 1:1 
propensity  score matching.
For the anal ysis of dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban, it is estimated that a total of approximately  
41,000 patients (16,000 dabigatran vs. 25,000 rivaroxaban patients) will be available for this 
study , based on the proposed time window of July  [ADDRESS_71448] a relative difference in the rate 
of major bleeding of 22% with 80% power, and 25% with 90% power, between the 
rivaroxaban and dabigatran groups.

Protocol for non -interventional studies based on existing data
BI Study Number 1160.274 c14336616- 01
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_71449] -01(4.0)For the anal ysis of dabigatran vs. api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], it is estimated that a total of approximately  
27,000 patients (6,000 dabigatran and 21,000 api[INVESTIGATOR_65621]) will be available for this 
study , based on the proposed time window of December [ADDRESS_71450] a relative 
difference 
in the rate of major bleeding of 37% with 80% power, and 43% with 90% power, between the 
api[INVESTIGATOR_65622]. The analy sis may therefore have insufficient power to detect 
a smaller treatment difference if the expected sample size is confirmed. 
The actual power of the study  will be dependent on the actual event rate in each treatment 
group, the covariates included in the anal ysis models, and the actual loss of patients during 
matching, and may  therefore differ.
9.[ADDRESS_71451] the study -specific anal ytic datasets. Data are 
checked for internal consistency  within each patient’s claims/records relevant to the study  
analyses and an y patients with extreme or unexpected treatment patterns or diagnoses are 
identified. BIPI [INVESTIGATOR_65623]. All data management a nd 
statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS Version 9.4 (or later) in the secured 
environment
9.7 DATA ANALYSIS
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC).
Baseline characteristics will be described for the two cohorts based on the NOAC treatment 
(dabigatran vs. rivaroxaban and dabigatran vs. api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) using standard summary  statistics. 
Means (±standard deviation, SD) and median (interquartile range) will be reported for 
continuous variables and frequenc ies (%) for categorical variables. The final study  sample 
will be newly  initiating cohorts.
To account for potential selection bias, the study  cohorts (dabigatran/rivaroxaban and 
dabigatran/api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) will be matched on their baseline characteristics using the propensity  
score matching (PSM) method.  The PSM aims to balance the two treatment group s on 
baseline demographics, health plan ty pe and clinical characteristics. The feasibility of PSM 
will be evaluated based on available sample size and descriptive results. If patient 
characteristics between dabigatran/rivaroxaban and dabigatran/api[INVESTIGATOR_65624] y different, i.e., less than 50% of patients in the dabigatran group can be matched 
to the rivaroxaban or api[INVESTIGATOR_65615], then the study  design will be re -
evaluated before proceeding to anal ysis. The Nearest Neighbor method of propensity  score 
matching within a caliper of 0.10 -0.20 (depending on resulting sample sizes) of the standard 
deviation of the estimated logit will be used to select the matched samples.

BI Study Number 1160.274 c14336616- 01
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_71452] -01(4.0)The propensit y score will be defined as the probability  of bei ng treated with the index NOAC 
based on a set of baseline characteristics. If, for example, two patients, one in the dabigatran 
group and another in the rivaroxaban group , had the same propensity  score, they  would both 
have the same probability of being tr
eated with dabigatran. The final list of baseline 
characteristics to be utilized in the PSM will be decided in conjunction with BI. The 
following baseline characteristics in the pre -index period will be considered: age, gender, 
health plan ty pe, geographic region, month and year of index date, Charlson comorbidity  
index (CCI), stroke risk scores (i.e. CHADS 2or CHA 2DS 2-VASc), bleeding risk scores (i.e., 
modified HAS -BLED), relevant baseline comorbid conditions and medication use asdefined 
in Section 9.3.3. The distribution of baseline characteristics will be presented before and after 
the matching process. For baseline covariates that are not sufficiently  balanced after PSM , the 
covariates will be included in an appropriate multivariate model to adjust for those 
differences.

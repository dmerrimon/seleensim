2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Background and rationale for research based on existing literature:  
Alzheimer ’s disease afflicts over 5 million Americans and is the 6th leading cause of death in 
the U.S. To date, advanced dementia research has largely focused on describing the end -of-
life experience of patients with this disease. Designing and testing intervention s targeting 
those opportunities is the current research priority for this field. Advance care planning 
(ACP) is the most consistent modifiable factor associated with better palliative care 
outcomes in advanced dementia.  
The opportunity for ACP is exceptional in advanced dementia but often inadequate. Thus, 
advanced dementia patients often get aggressive interventions that may be inconsistent 
with preferences and of little clinical benefit. Recent work has particularly underscored the 
need to avoid unwanted  and unnecessary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340813]. Traditional 
ACP primarily relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of hypothetical health states and 
treatments. This approach is limited because complex scenarios are difficult to envision,  
information from providers is inconsistent, and verbal explanations are hindered by [CONTACT_340830].  
To address these shortcomings, the co- PIs have developed video decision support tools for 
ACP and shown their efficacy in several randomized controlled  trials (RCTs) in out -patient 
settings. The over -riding goal of the EVINCE (Educational Video to Improve Nursing home 
Care in End -stage dementia) study is to conduct a cluster RCT of an ACP intervention vs. 
control among 360 -400  nursing home (NH) residents  with advanced dementia (N=180 -
200/arm) in up to - 70 matched N Hs ( up to 3 5 intervention/ up to 3 5  control.  
2.2 Previous (non -clinical, pre -clinical or clinical)  studies leading up to and supporting the 
proposed research:  
The literature clearly demonstrates the opportunity to improve advanced dementia care

the clinical care (e.g., ACP, treatme nts). Third, the effect of the video over time has not been 
well -examined. The proposed RCT will address these limitations, and is the next logical step 
towards understanding the real world application of a video ACP support tool for advanced 
dementia.       
 
2.3 Describe w hy this research is important and how it will contribute  to existing 
knowledge:  
Better ACP is a key opportunity to improve advanced dementia care. Video decision support 
is a pra ctical, evidence -based, and innovative approach to ACP. If this RCT is successful, this 
will be one of the first rigorously tested interventions shown to improve outcomes for NH 
residents with advanced dementia. This work could have significant clinical an d policy 
implications for the millions of Americans dying with this disease by [CONTACT_340831].

Over the past [ADDRESS_421867] complex and sensitive data from their charts, nurses, and proxies.  
4 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
               Provide study objectives/aims/h ypotheses:  
The over -riding goal of the EVINCE (Educational Video to Improve Nursing home Care in 
End -stage dementia) study is to conduct a cluster RCT of an video ACP intervention . The 
Specific aims and hypotheses are:  
 
Aim 1: To conduct a cluster RCT of an ACP intervention vs. control among 360 -400  NH 
residents with advanced dementia (N=180 -200 /arm) in up to 70  matched NHs ( up to 35 
intervention/ up to 35 control), and to compare their proxies ’ preferences for their level of 
care. Levels of care options are: com fort care (i.e., no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340814]: 617- 971- [ADDRESS_421868]                          Fax: 617- 971 -5350

comfort, e.g. hip fracture), basic  care (i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340815], intubation, 
or i ntensive treatments  (i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], resuscitation, intubation, tube feeding, ICU 
care), or uncertain. Preferences will be ascertained from proxies at baseline (pre and [ADDRESS_421869] video in intervention NHs), 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.  At baseline, proxies in the 
intervention NHs will view a video ACP decision support tool. Their preferre d level of care 
ascertained ~ 10 minutes after viewing the video will be communicated to the primary care 
team. Proxies in the control NHs will experience the usual ACP practices in those NHs.  
H1: A higher % of proxies in the intervention vs. control NHs will choose comfort care at baseline (~ 10 minutes after viewing video in intervention arm), and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months 
follow -up.  
  
Aim 2: To compare the % of residents with advance care palnning ( ACP ) in the intervention 
vs. control NHs at 3, 6, 9, and 1 2 months as measured by [CONTACT_340832]: 1. Explicit decisions 
to forego hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 2. Explicit decisions to forego other treatments (tube -feeding, 
parenteral therapy), and 3. Goal of care discussions between proxies and providers.  
H2a: A higher proporti on of residents in the intervention (vs. control) NHs will have 
documented decisions to forego hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51530] 3, 6 (primary study outcome), 9, and 12 
months.  
H2b: A higher proportion of residents in the intervention (vs. control) NHs will have 
documen ted decisions to forego other treatments, and goals of care discussions at 3, 6, 9, 
and 12 months.  
 
Aim 3: To compare the % of residents with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788] (admission or emergency 
department) and other burdensome treatments (tube -feeding, parenteral therapy) over 12 
months in intervention vs. control NHs. 
H3: There will be a lower proportion of residents in the intervention (vs. control) NHs 
having at least one hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340816] 12 
months follow -up. 
 
5 STUDY DESIGN

with advanced dementia (N=180 -200 /arm) in up to 70 matched NHs ( up to 35 
intervention/ up to 35 control) ..   
5.2 Study duration  (total) : 
Five years  
5.3 Duration of study for participa nts: 
12 months  for all residents and all but 10 proxies who  will be recruited to participate in a 
one-time 10 minute interview one month afte r their dyad completes the study..

> 45 beds and be within 60 miles of [LOCATION_011]. The number of facilities and eligibility criteria 
were chosen in order to achieve an appropriate sample size within the 36 -month 
recruitment period and allow us to concentrate our data collection efforts . 
Within our network of 32 NHs, 40% of facilities are for -profit . We will pair up to 7 0 NHs 
(up to 35 pairs) based on the for-profit status  and randomly assign one NH in each pair to 
the intervention group and the other to the control group . A computer g enerated algorithm 
will be used to randomly assign one matched pair at a time, as  we stagger the start of 
subject enrollment at the NHs bringing 2 NHs (i.e., one matched pair) i nto the study  at a 
time . Matched pairs will always be enrolled at the same time .  The statistician will remain 
blinded to the names of the nursing homes during the randomization process. 
 
6.2 Total  target  number of participants to be enrolled:  
360-400 dyads of nursing home residents with advanced dementia and their health care 
proxies will be recruited; approxiatemately [ADDRESS_421873] not yet been recruited, therefore table below in not completed.

6.3 Inclusion criteria:  
Resident eligibility criteria are: 1) Age  GE 65  at the time of screening , 2) A diagnosis of 
dementia (any type), 3) Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) score of 7 , 4) NH length of stay >  
30 days, 5) proxy is available who can speak in English, and 6) proxy must either live within 
a 60 mile radius of [LOCATION_011] or be available to come to the resident ’s NH within two weeks of 
recruitment in order to conduct the in -person baseline interview. Fea tures of GDS stage 7 
include: profound memory deficits (cannot recognize family), total functional dependence, 
speech < [ADDRESS_421874] not been translated into 
other languages. As in our prior studies, we will enroll prox ies who are  formally  designated 
to make medical decisions for the patient as noted in the NH chart (i.e., durable power of 
attorney for health care). However, if t here is no such formal designation, we will enroll the 
informally designated  health care decision -maker for the resident  (i.e., next -of-kin) as 
indicated in the NH record.  
Providers from  up to [ADDRESS_421875] participated in 
the study and where study activity has been mostly completed, wherein no more than 1 
resident is currently active in the study.   
6.4 Exclusion criteria:  
Residents with cognitive impair ment due to causes other than dementia (e.g., head trauma)

and in short -term, sub -acute SNFs will be excluded.  
6.5 Participant recruitment (describe recruitment method s and submit any materials to be 
used to recruit participants ): 
At baseline and q 3months thereafter (up to 36 months) a research assistant (RA) will 
interview nurses on each NH unit to identify eligible residents based on the aforementioned 
eligibility criteria. A diagnosis of dementia will be confirmed by [CONTACT_14716], and clarified 
with the resident ’s primary care provider if nece ssary. One  packet of recruitment materials  
will be left in the resident's room and another will be mailed to the proxies of eligible 
residents , including an introductory letter about the study, a study flyer, and  a copy of the 
consent for m for their refer ence. Proxies will be telephoned one  week later to solicit their 
participation , confirm eligibility , and obtain informed consent for themselves and residents  
(see section 6.6) .  If no contact [CONTACT_340833], the proxies will be called weekly for 
a maximum of three weeks , at which point a second  mailing of the same recruitment 
materials will be made.  One week after the second mailing, the RA will initiate the same 
proce ss of weekly calls for a maximum of thre e weeks.  If no contact [CONTACT_340834] /calling  series, no further attempt to contact 
[CONTACT_340835].  This approach to recruitmen t, involving weekly calls  to proxies has 
been used for three previous larger studies by [CONTACT_2296].  The previous studies involved 
outreach to more than 3,000 proxies, successfully recruiting approximately 1200 dyads 
without complaint from any proxy.  If the proxies are willing to p articipate  and consent 
obtained , the baseline in -person interview will be scheduled within two weeks either at 
their homes or at the NHs based on the proxy ’s preference.  
To increase study awaren ess and enthusiasm among resident proxies, we will be leaving 
study flyers in the facility or unit  and introducing the study during family meetings at the 
discretion of the study contact [CONTACT_340836].   
6.6 Procedures for obtaining informed consent , including who will obtain consent and the 
timing of consent from recruitment : 
An introductory letter , a study flyer  and a copy of the study consent form  will be left in the 
eligible residents rooms and mailed to the ir proxies  as described in the  recruitment 
procedures section (6.5).   During the telephone call in which the RA ultimately contacts the 
proxy, the RA will  solicit their participation  and answer any questions. T he RA will read the 
consent form to the proxy over the telephone. As the r esidents have advanced dementia, the 
proxy will provide informed consent for the residents and themselves. If, after the RA reads 
the full consent form to the proxy, the proxy agrees to participate and gives verbal consent 
for both themselves and the resid ent to participate in the study, the RA will sign the consent 
form and mail it to the proxy.   This telephone consent procedure has worked well and 
efficiently for recruitment of over [ADDRESS_421877]    Phone: 617- 971- [ADDRESS_421878]                          Fax: 617- 971 -5350

individuals; the research assistant conducting the chart reviews will be blinded to the 
nursing home allocation (control vs. intervention). At  the baseline  in-person  interview we 
will be asking questions and giving information about advance care planning  to the proxy .  
A key part of the intervention is the placement of  a feedback  form about  the proxy 
preferences for the primary care team  into the resident's medical chart. If the research 
assistant doing the baseline chart review sees this form, he/she will know that the nursing 
home is an intervention site and this will ruin the fidelity of the blinding,  introducing 
potential bias into t he data collection . In addition, the research  procedures at the baseline 
in-person chart review may prompt changes in the resident's care plan. The intent of the 
baseline resident chart review is to  obtain  resident information unadulterated by [CONTACT_340837]. While the chart review could theorectically be conducted retrospectively to the 
date of the proxy interview, this additional detail would have the potential of introducing 
data collection errors in key outcome measures.  In summary, the baseline res ident chart 
review needs to be conducted before the in -person proxy interview, and this consent needs 
to be obtained at the time of initial contact [CONTACT_340838].  
Our team has extensive experience obtaining consent over the telephone from proxies of 
nursi ng home residents with advanced dementia from three other large  cohort studies. 
Given that randomization is at the NH level, two consent forms will be used. Both consent 
forms will seek permission for data collection, but proxies in the intervention NHs w ill also 
be asked to consent to the intervention.  
Verbal Consent for proxy and provider participation in the one -time study exit interview 
will be obtained at the  time of exit interview .    
Since the proxies that will be asked to participate in the exit interview have previously 
consented to participate in the study, they are aware of the study and will be asked to 
participate in one additional interview at the time of contact.  
To obtain verb al consent from providers to participate in the telephone interview towards 
the end of the study, a member of our research team will contact [CONTACT_340839], along with the purpose of the brief interview for which we seek their participation.  
Providers will be clearly informed that their participation is voluntary and that they can 
refuse further pa rticipation at any time.  Following this explanation, the research team 
member will ask provider for verbal consent, record their answer in the electronic data 
capture system, and continue immediately with the interview for all those that agree to 
participate.  
6.7 Withdrawal of participants (anticipated circumstances when participants will be 
withdrawn without their consent, how participants  will be withdrawn , including use of any 
collected  data and follow -up with  any new/pertinent information ): 
Proxies will be withdrawn from the study without their consent if we are unable to reach 
them for two consecutive follow -up interviews. Residents an d their proxies will be 
withdrawn from the study if the resident permanently moves out of his/her current nursing 
home to a new location wherein we have no research relationship .  All data collected on 
proxies or residents prior to involuntary withdrawal may be used as part of the analyses.  
Proxies are free to voluntarily withdraw  from  the study at any point.  It the y do withdraw,

The consent form will be read to the proxy and their questions will be addressed.  If the 
proxy agrees to participate, the research team member will sign the consent form and mail 
the signed copy to the proxy.

The video begins with a physician -moderator intro ducing the viewer to the broad concept 
of ACP for advanced dementia and the levels -of-care framework adapted from  our prior 
studies . The levels are : intensive medical care , basic medical care, and comfort care care .

script for this study is attached. There may be a few additional edits made to the script p rior 
to the study's initation. Enclosed is a an earlier version that is very similar to what we will 
use with several updates, including: the script will be changed to the one enclosed with this 
submission, the visual text and images will align with the re vised script, and images of a 
nursing home resident being tube -fed will be added to the portion describing intensive 
medical treatment. The final video  will be submitted to the IRB prior to starting the study.  
Proxies in the intervention NHs will be shown  the video on the  research assistant's (RA's)  
iPad  at the baseline in -person interview. Immediately prior to and approximately 10 
minutes following the video, the RA  will read a brief verbal description of each level of care 
to the proxies, identical in format as will be used in the control group, and their preference will be ascertained  (e.g., intensive  medical care , basic care, or comfort care) . The RA will 
record t he proxies’ post -
video preferences on feedback forms that will be put on the 
residents’ charts and emailed/mailed to their primary care providers. The descriptions of 
the levels and of the types of treatments that align with each level will be on this form .   
Proxies in the control NHs will be exposed to the usual ACP practiced in the facilities. The y 
will a lso have an in -person baseline interview at which they will read a brief verbal 
description of each level of care, and the ir preference will be ascertai ned for research 
purposes only . Proxies in the control arm will not view the video. We also will not feedback 
baseline preferences to providers in control NHs because we want the ACP planning process to reflect usual care as much as possible and because we  consider this feedback to be an 
integral component of an ACP intervention. We did not feel a more developed attention 
control was needed for several reasons. First, proxies in the control NHs will have the same 
exposure to the research team as those on th e intervention, including a baseline in -person 
interview. Second, the RAs will read brief descriptions of the levels of care to the proxies in 
the control arm at each interview in order to ascertain their preferences. Thus, the research 
protocol already pa rtially augments their awareness of ACP. Finally, the primary outcome is 
obtained from the residents’ charts, and does not rely on proxy measures. After completion 
of this entire study, NHs in the control arm will be provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_340820] e 
as part of clinical care at their discretion.

Data will be collected from each dyad by [CONTACT_340841], and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. At baseline, a nurse with primary care responsibilities 
for the resident will be i dentified and interviewed by [CONTACT_340842] 3 -minutes in a private space in the facility to assess the resident's functional 
statues. The baseline proxy interview will be in -person and all subsequent interviews will 
be over the te lephone. A chart review will also be conducted within 6 week s  of death.  Data 
elements collected at each of these interviews/assessments are described below : 
 Resident baseline assessment (28 minutes): (20 -minute chart review, 3 -minute nursing 
interview, 5-minute resident examination). The following data will be abstracted from the 
chart: demographic data, medical comorbidity, decisions to forego hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340821], and feeding tube use. The nursing interview will include functional st atus 
(BANS -S) and will be conducted in a private space in the nursing home . Resident 
examination will measure cognitive status (TSI).  
Proxy baseline interview (30 minutes control; 42 minute intervention): A baseline in -
person interview will be conducted t o collect the following data: demographic, preference 
for level of treatment  (intensive, basic , comfort care or uncertain) , prior communication 
about ACP with providers, and comfort with the interview. In the intervention arm, 
preferences for the level of care will be ascertained from the proxies just prior to and ~10 
minutes after viewing the video.  
Resident quarterly assessments: (20 -minute chart review) The following data will be 
abstracted from the chart to reflect the residents’ status since the prior  assessment: 
decisions to forego hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340822], goals of care discussions, 
feeding tube use, parenteral therapy, other health services utilization, and acute illnesses.  
 Proxy quarterly interviews (20 minutes): Proxy telephone fo llow -up interviews will 
include: preference for level of care, communication with providers, and comfort with the 
interview.  
Resident death assessment (20 minutes): Every month , RAs will contact [CONTACT_340843] a subject’s death in a timely manner.  Charts will be reviewed within [ADDRESS_421885] month of life spent in the NH, and 
the following information since the prior assessment: decisions to forego hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340823], goals of care discussions, feeding tube use, parenteral therapy, other 
health services uti lization, and acute illnesses.  
Brief (~10 minute) exit interviews will be conducted over the telephone with a small 
sample of proxies that participated in the intervention arm of the study, as well as providers

consented prox ies from the intervention group , (weekly for  up to 3 weeks ) and  ask the  proxy to 
participate in one additional ~10 minute interview.  Following obtainment of verbal consent 
the RA will proceed with the interview.  
 
Brief (~10 minute) telephone interviews will be conducted with a small sample of 
healthcare providers that are known to have been involved in the care of participating residents.   
To capture the perspectives of providers that have been involved in providing car e to 
residents participating in the interve ntion arm of the study, and at the same time,  avoid 
influencing the provision of care during the remainder of the study, we will attempt to 
interview providers from homes wherein at least [ADDRESS_421890] procedures bei ng performed  as routine medical care ( e.g. for diagnostic or 
treatment purposes ): 
All resident treatments and orders i n both study arms will occur at the discretion of the NH 
providers as part of their routine medical care. The study does not include any  direct 
clinical intervention to the resident's care.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_421891] procedures being performed solely for the research:  
Prodecures conducted solely for research include: all proxy  and provider  interviews, all 
resident chart reviews, and exposure of the proxies in the intervention arm to the video with feedback of their stated preferences being placed into their medical record and sent to 
the NH providers.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_421892] participant privacy:  
All access to data is restricted to those in the research group who have been authorized by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_340824].  Because HSL is a licensed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the information 
technology group adheres to all the policies and practices under the HIPAA regulations, 
therefore, creating a very tight computing environment. In order to preserve confidentiality, 
subjects will be assigned a study number known only to the co- PIs, RAs and data manager. 
All data collected el ectronically by [CONTACT_340844] s and iPads  use internet -based 
electronic data capture programs (i.e., RedCap) accessible only to research personnel 
through the use of unique password. Al l written documentation with subject information 
will be stored  in a locked area at HSL, accessible only to the co- PIs, RAs and data manager. 
All data will be stored on computer workstations, accessible only through use of a unique 
password. Access to these data will be limited to study personnel on a “need to know ” basis. 
If a NH resident is deemed ineligible for the study, all personal health information obtained for screening purposes will be destroyed as soon as possible.

8.1 Statistical methods:  
Aim 1: To compare the preferred level of care of proxies in the intervention (vs. control) 
nursing home s (NHs) . The percent ( %) of proxies choosing each of the following levels of 
care at baseline (prior to and ~10 minutes after viewing the video in intervention group), 3 
and 6 and 12 months will be calculated: intensive treatments, basic  care, comfort care, or 
uncertain. For H ypot hesis 1 (H1) , the outcome will be dichotomized as comfort care vs. 
other. The proportion of proxies choosing comfort care will be compared between the 
intervention and control groups using an extension of logistic regression based on general 
estamited equa tions (GEE)  to account for the clustering at the NH level at each time period. 
The focus of H1 will be on comparing preferences obtained from proxies ~[ADDRESS_421895] method.  
Aim 2: To compare advance care planning (ACP)  between residents in the intervention vs. 
control NHs: The initial approach will be to describe the % of residents in both arms with 
the followin g ACP outcomes by 3, 6, 9, and 12 months determined from documentation in 
the resident ’s chart: 1. Decisions to forego hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 2. Decisions to forego tube -
feeding, 3. Decisions to forego parenteral therapy, and 4. Goal of care discussions. The 
proportion of residents with these outcomes will be considered cumulatively at each time 
point, including those who died. For H ypotheses 2a and 2b, the proportion of residents with 
each ACP outcome will be compared between the intervention and control groups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using an extension of logistic regression based on GEE to account for the 
clustering at the NH level. The % of residents with a documented explicit decision to forego 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340825] 6 -months follow -up will be the primary outcome of this randomized 
clinical trial .  
3.C.iii.b.3. Aim 3: To compare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340826]. 
control NHs.  The proportion of all residents experiencing each of following outcomes at 
least once over entire 12 month follow -up period will be calculated: i. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], 
ii. emergency department ( ED) visits (without admission), iii. tube -feeding, and iv. 
parenteral therapy.  Analyses for H3 will focus on two outcomes: i. the proportion of 
residents experiencing the  following at least one hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181225] (i.e., any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1410]) over 12 months and ii. the proportion of residents experiencing either tube -
feeding or parenteral therapy over 12 months. The outcomes will be compared 
between the interventi on and control groups using an extension of logistic regression based 
on GEE to account for the clustering at the NH levels. Analyses will be at the level of the 
resident.  Odds ratio s and 95% C onfidence Intervals will be generated from these analyses.   
8.2 Sample size  determination (include power calculations or provide justification for their 
absence, e.g., pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility study) : 
The sample size between 360-400  dyads from up to 60 NHs (180 -200 dyads/ up to 30 NHs 
per treatment arm) will provide sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful differences 
between the intervention and control NHs for our primary outcome :  a decision to forego 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340827] [ADDRESS_421896]    Phone: 617- 971- [ADDRESS_421897]                          Fax: 617- 971 -5350

provided for selected secondary outcomes for Aims 1 and 3. All calculations use two -sided 
testing and a 5% type I error ra te. Power calculations are adjusted for potential dependence 
of observations within NHs using an intraclass correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_421898] 96% power to detect an absolute 
difference of 25% for the  primary outcome (Aim 2) and 82% power to detect a 20% 
difference. For secondary outcomes, power to detect a 25% difference is excellent for a 
baseline preferences (post video in intervention arm) (Aim 1), and good for a 20% 
difference. Power to detect a 1 5% difference in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788] (Aim 3) is very good, but 
limited for smaller differences.Table 3. Power estimatesTable 3. Power estimates  
8.3 Data management (data collection and data entry) : 
 Data management and analysis for the study will take place at Hebrew SeniorLife (HSL). 
It is anticipated that the field staff involved in our prior work will be hired for this study, 
and thus have experience administering many of the data collection elements. The principal 
investigators  will oversee the training of the field staff for four months prior to starting 
data collection. During the study, the co- PIs will perform unannounced reliability checks on 
a 5% sample of chart reviews and proxy interviews.  
Five  research Assistants (RAs) will be responsible for screening subjects, obtaining 
informed consent, interviewing nurses and proxies, implementing the intervention, 
conducting chart reviews, and doing the brief baseline resident cognitive examination.  RA [ADDRESS_421899] all the other outcome data through chart reviews and follow -up proxy interviews.   
RA5 is 
primarily responsible for proxy recruitment and obtaining consent from proxies.  She will not be blinded to the study assignment.  
All data will be collected and  enter ed electronically by [CONTACT_340845] . State -of-the-art electronic data capture software and programming  (e.g., 
RedCap) will be used for these purposes. Once entered, the data will be downloaded and 
entered into the computer systems at HSL IFAR for  cleaning, programming and analyses.   
9 FORESEEABLE RISKS , POTENTIAL BENEFITS , COMPENSATION AND COSTS TO PARTICIPANTS  
9.1 Potential medical  risks of study procedures:  
We anticipate little risk to the residents  enrolled in this study  and we don ’t anticipant any 
proxy medical risks.  All the resident data will be obtained from their medical record, 
baseline nursing interviews, and a [ADDRESS_421900] conducted this cognitive examination on over 1200  
NH residents in our prior studies without any adverse consequences. If at any time the 
resident appears bothered or distressed  by [CONTACT_340846], the RA will cease the 
examination.  Residents in the control NHs will experience usual ACP as practiced in their 
NHs. Residents in the intervention NHs will experience ACP subsequent to their proxies ’ 
exposure to the intervention  (video plus feedback of preferences placed in chart and sent to 
their primary care provider). Given that the proxies are the designated health care decision -
makers for these residents, it is reasonable to assume they will make informed decisions

based on the residents ’ perceived wishes and in their best interests. Thus, the risk from the 
intervention for the resident is expected to be minimal.  
9.2 Psychosocial (non -medical) risks, discomforts, inconveniences:  
We don’t anticipate any resident psychosocial risks, discomforts or inconveniences . The 
proxy interviews include questions related to the illness of their loved ones, and therefore 
may be distressing. Proxies may refuse to answer any of the questions. In our prior studies 
of NH residents with advanced dementia, we have conducted over 1200  repeated proxy 
interviews using similar questions. These interviews were very well tolerated. When 
proxies were asked how comfortable they were a nswering the study questions, only 3% 
stated that they were uncomfortable. The RAs never had to stop the interview because of 
proxy distress.  In the intervention arm, proxies will listen to and watch a 12-minute video 
that contains a verbal narrative and visual images describing 3 the levels of care (  intensive 
medical  care,  basic medical  care, and comfort care), and therefore may be distressing. Using 
similar video decision support tools in our prior studies that involved a combined total of 
several hund red subjects, including healthy older adults, older patients admitted to sub -
acute skilled nursing facilities, and patients with advanced cancer, over 90% of subjects 
rated the videos as highly acceptable, helpful, and would recommend it to others. The RAs  
never had to stop the interview because of subject distress. Should a proxy become 
distressed during the interviews or while watching the video and prefer not to continue, the 
RA will be instructed to cease the study procedures. The RA will offer to telep hone him/her 
back the next day to see how he/she is managing. If deemed necessary, the RA may suggest 
to the proxy that he/she contact [CONTACT_5657]/her primary care provider.   Proxies will also be slightly 
inconvenienced by [CONTACT_106269] -person baseline interview and sub sequent telephone interviews. 
We will schedule all interviews at the convenience of the proxy. Moreover, for the baseline 
in-person, we will offer for the RA to either come to their home or meet them at the NH, 
according to their preference.  
An additional  potential burden of this study is the time commitment of the NH staff to 
participate in facility orientation, resident recruitment, and baseline nursing interviews. 
Data collection procedures and intervention implementation will not require any staff 
assistance. We will make every effort to minimize staff burden. The NH administrators in the ~[ADDRESS_421902] not felt these procedures 
to be too onerous. Based on our experience, each nursing interview is expected to take < [ADDRESS_421903] these interviews at times that are convenient for the 
nurses.  
 
9.3 Potential benefits to individual participant:  
Proxies in both study arms will gain knowledge about levels of care options for residents 
with advanced dementia. Proxies in the control NHs will be read brief descriptions of the 
levels of care by [CONTACT_340847], thus 
augmenting their awareness of ACP. Proxies in the intervention arm will gain this 
knowledge by [CONTACT_340848]: 617- 971- [ADDRESS_421904]                          Fax: 617- 971 -5350

read by [CONTACT_340849]. Residents in the intervention arm may furthe r benefit by 
[CONTACT_340850], as perceived by [CONTACT_340851], communicated to their 
healthcare providers. Thus, there is the potential for residents to benefit from the study by 
[CONTACT_340852]. Proxies also may find that 
some stress is relieved by [CONTACT_340853], impartial listener about issues 
related to their loved ones care and illness.  
9.4 Potential benefits to study population , community, or society:  
 The results gleaned from the study are intended to improve the advance care planning  
(ACP)  in advanced dementia.  Better ACP is a key opportunity to improve advanced 
dementia care. Video decision support is a practical, evidence -based, and innovative 
approach to ACP. If this RCT is successful, this will be one of the first rigorously tested interventions shown to impr ove outcomes for NH residents with advanced dementia. This 
work could have significant clinical and policy implications for the millions of Americans 
dying with this disease by [CONTACT_340854].  
9.5 Describe provisions for medical care and available compensation in the event of 
injury , if any : 
Should a proxy become distressed during the interviews or while watc hing the video and 
prefer not to continue, the RA will be instructed to cease the study procedures. The RA will 
offer to telephone him/her back the next day to see how he/she is managing. If deemed 
necessary, the RA may suggest to the proxy that he/she con tact his/her primary care 
provider.  
 
9.6 Remuneration  for participants (e.g.  goods, services, gift cards, cash, etc.) : 
Proxies tha t agree to participate will be given a $[ADDRESS_421905] in appreciation for their time 
and efforts in the study.  
 
9.7 Describe any costs participants may incur during the study:  
Proxies will have the option  of having the in -person baseline interview in their home (RA 
will travel to their home) or the NH. If the y opt for the NH, then the proxy will incur the cost 
of travel to NH.  
 
10 SAFETY ASSESSMENT  AND STUDY MONITORING  
10.1 Definition s of adverse event and serious adverse event  for the study : 
The study has been granted a low -risk status by [CONTACT_18121]. The DSAC has agreed that the only 
potential SAE (serious adverse event ) for this study is extreme distress of proxies while 
viewing the intervention video or answering questions about the residents ’ care, as defined 
by [CONTACT_147664]  
1. Based on the assessment of the  trained Research Assistant, the proxy exhibits signs of 
severe emotional distress (i.e., excessive crying,  anger, sadness etc) while watching the video or during the interview suc h they are unable or unwilling to continue.  (Due to the 
sensitive nature of the material, minor emotional responses by [CONTACT_340855], such as 
tearing up, are expected by [CONTACT_340856] a SAE)  
2. The proxy directly requests that the protocol be stopped or leaves th e room during

during the video or interview due to distress.  
 
 (Patients with advanced dementia are very frail. In the natural course of the disease, we 
expect of 40% mortality rate over one year.  Thus, while deaths will be reported to the Data Safety and monitoring committee, they are not considered an adverse event. 
10.2 Adverse event (AE) reporting (method, distribution  and time frame) : 
If an adverse or unexpected event occurs, it wil l be recorded by [CONTACT_340857] -based Adverse Event form.  The research assistant will 
immediately notify the Project Director of the event by [CONTACT_340858], email, or in -person.  The Projec t Director will notify the PI ([CONTACT_131854] or [CONTACT_340864] if [CONTACT_131854] is unavailable) with 24 hours in -person or by [CONTACT_756]. The Data 
Safety Advisory Committee chair and HSL IRB chair will be notified of this event within 48  
hours in writing (email and/or hard copy).  
  
10.3 Process for data and safety monitoring:  
Safety monitoring will be the responsibility of a Data and Safety  Advisory 
Committee(DSAC) composed of voting and non -voting members.  The non -voting members 
include:  the co- Principal Investigators , the study biostatistician , the data analyst and 
proje ct director.  The voting members include: two experienced clinical dementia 
investigators and one experienced biostatistician from outside the Harvard/Hebrew 
SeniorLife system.  One voting member will be designated as chair.  The NIH Project Officer 
respon sible for EVINCE will also be invited to attend DSAC meetings but will be a non -
voting member.  The voting members will function as independent Safety Monitors. The 
committee was convened on November 5th via conference call to provide input and 
guidance on  the composition and conduct of the DSAC, study protocols, quality assurance 
and safety issues related to the protocols, and to define serious adverse events..   
DSAC meetings will occur every [ADDRESS_421907] of an open and a closed session. The open 
session will be attended by [CONTACT_340859]. Issues discussed during the open session will include aggregated (two study arms combined) reports of the f ollowing: subject 
and facility recruitment rates, dropout rates, deaths, protocol deviations, SAEs, and 
unanticipated problems. The closed session will immediately follow the open session and 
will be attended only by [CONTACT_340860].  Data reviewed in the closed session will include primary and secondary outcomes as well as all items presented in the open -session 
(subject and facility recruitment, dropout rates, death, , protocol deviations, serious adverse 
events and unanticipated problems) stratified by [CONTACT_340861] a blinded fashion. 
The DSAC will be free to determine the need to stop the protocol based on examination of 
serious adverse events and study outcomes.  At minimum, in each report the DSAC will 
evaluate a preset stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_340828] a statistically significant (one sided P<0.05) 
higher count of SAEs in the intervention group.  Within a week after the DSAC meeting, the

reports fr om the DSAC to HSL IRB within a week of the meeting.  The IRB chair will be 
informed of any SAEs or DSAC decision to stop the study for any reason within 48 hours.  
       
 
10.4 If this is a multi -site study, indicate how modifications of study procedures or 
materials will be communicated across  sites, as well as communication of adverse 
events , or other issues affecting the research :  
While the study involves multiple N Hs, all the data collections and study protocol will be 
handled by [CONTACT_340862]. Therefore, modifications of study procedures and 
adverse events across will be communicated among the study personnel at the regularly 
scheduled team meetings or  ad hoc telephone meetings or emails as the situation dictates. 
The Project Director (s), under the direction of the co- PIs will ensure this communication. In 
additon, at each NH, there will be a senior administrator (i.e., Director of Nursing, Medical Dir
ector) identified as the study contact. The project director and/or PIs will take 
responsibility of communicating any modifications or adverse events to that individual.

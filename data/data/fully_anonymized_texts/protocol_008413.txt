prevention, 20% -30% of U.S. women ≥[ADDRESS_1152170] 3

underscreened women.5–7 2012 national guidelines id entify increasing screening coverage as the

cancerous cervical neoplasia grade 2 to 3,  carcinoma in situ, and invasive cervical cancer 
(hereafter referred to as CIN 2,3+) from Pap co -testing with FDA -approved tests for high -risk 
(hr) HPV infection compared to Pap screening alone for women ≥[ADDRESS_1152172] in an

collected at home (with in -clinic follow -up of hrHPV -positive women), the need for in -clinic 
screening could be eliminated for a majority of women.

are only recommended for women ≤[ADDRESS_1152174] not been widely us ed even 
among the recommended target population,15 the majority of women ≥3 0 years of age (the age 
group at highest risk for cervical cancer) are unvaccinated. Although Pap screening programs 
have been highly effective in reducing cervical cancer rates over the past 50 years, a significant 
portion of U.S. women do not participate  in regular Pap screening; 20% -30% of U.S. women 
≥[ADDRESS_1152175] not been screened in the pas t three years.5–7 Reaching 
underscreened women is a top national priority for reducing disparities in cervical cancer 
prevention; in fact, t he 2012 joint cervical cancer screening guidelines state that the #1 research 
priority is to increase screening coverage.1 There is a significant need for targeted, inn ovative 
interventions that increase screening participation and adherence to recommended screening 
intervals, while maintaining high quality care. The joint guidelines advocate for novel programs 
incorporating self -sampling for hrHPV testing, and evaluatio n of the “scale -up, implementation, 
and acceptability of such programs17” targeting underscreened women.[ADDRESS_1152176] is 
directly responsive to this nationa l recommendation, and will provide definitive evidence -based 
data on the ability of an in -home programmatic HPV screening outreach strategy to enhance 
early detection of cervical neoplasia and improve screening compliance. It is likely that this 
innovative  study could change the ways in which women participate in cervical cancer screening 
programs. Furthermore, we will investigate patient experiences and attitudes that are associated 
with in -home HPV screening uptake and complete follow up of hrHPV+ test re sults. The latter is 
particularly important for understanding adherence to the continuum of cervical cancer 
prevention, from screening through treatment. While the majority of cervical cancers are 
attributable to lack of screening, up to 13% of cervical ca ncers diagnosed in fully -insured women 
are attributable to delayed follow up of abnormal Pap results.7,18,19

3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
 
3.1.1 Female sex  
 
3.1.2 30 years to 64 years of age

3.2.1 Currently pregnant  
 
3.2.2 Language interpreter needed  
 
3.2.3 On "do not contact [CONTACT_4111]" for research studies  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
The scientific objective of the proposed research is to study the ability of an in -home 
programmatic HPV screening outreach strategy to enhance early detection of cervical neoplasia 
and improve screening compliance. Because cervical cancer only affects women, our entire study 
popu lation will be composed of women.  
 
Race and ethnicity are not eligibility requirements for participation in our study. We will include 
all minorities that are Kaiser Permanente Washington members and meet our study eligibility 
requirements. The ethnic/racial composition of our study population will therefore largely reflect 
the ethnic/racial composition of Kaiser Permanente Washington women members. The projected 
proportions of participants from different ethnic/racial backgrounds are based on th e composition 
of Kaiser Permanente Washington members (See Planned Enrollment Report table in Section 
5.1). 
 
3.4 Inclusion of Children  
 
We are not enrolling women younger than age 21 in the current study.  All current guideline 
recommendations (2012) are that cervical cancer screening should begin at age 21 years 
(regardless of sexual history).  Screening before age [ADDRESS_1152179] Recruitment and Screening  
 
Revision: March 17, 2015   Page 9 of 18 4.1.1 Primary objectives, and secondary objectives one (1.2.1), two (1.2.2), and three (1.2.3)  
 
Eligible women will be identified using electronic medical record (EMR) data; all e ligible 
women will be enrolled under a waiver of consent. The study programmer will use SAS software 
built in simple random sample procedure to randomly allocate participants 1:[ADDRESS_1152180] to complete HPV self -sampling. Women will 
be informed participation is voluntary and provided with a telephone number to call with 
questions or to “opt -out” of having their individual -level  medical record data used for research. 
To mirror Kaiser Permanente Washington prevention outreach protocols, if the kit is not returned 
within three weeks, study staff will make up to three reminder calls.  
 
4.1.2 Secondary objective four (1.2.4), survey  
 
We wil l mail survey invitation letters to intervention arm participants six months after trial 
randomization. We will sample two groups based on kit return status, using EMR data to identify 
and recruit “kit returners” and “non -returners”. Invitation letters wil l ask women to complete a 5 -
10 minute web survey about their experience with a “health screening kit” mailed 6 months 
prior.  
 
4.1.3 Secondary objective five (1.2.5), interview  
 
Potential interview participants will be identified [ADDRESS_1152181] a 15 –[ADDRESS_1152182] medical records: (1) cervical cancer screening, 
diagn osis, and treatment, (2) medical information related to cervical cancer risk factors, and (3) 
demographic information. For example, doctor visits and lab tests, age, ethnic background and

Subjects randomized to the intervention arm (in -home screening) will be asked to wash their 
hands and then push a polyester swab into their vagina as far as they can with no pain.  Rotate 
three times and take the swab out.  Put the swab in a specimen cup.  Repeat the sample collection 
on a second swab. Pla ce the specimen in a return mailer and mail the sample to the Kaiser 
Permanente Washington central laboratory.

5.2 Analysis Plans  
 
5.2.1 Analysis plan relevant to primary objectives and secondary objectives one (1.2.1), two 
(1.2.2), and three (1.2.3)  
 
Data will be analyzed based on the intention -to-treat principle. Denominators for each arm will 
genera lly include all women randomized to that arm, minus the women identified post -
randomization as ineligible. For diagnosed and treated CIN 2+, abnormal screening results, and 
screening uptake, we will compare the proportion of outcomes detected in the interv ention arm 
to the proportion detected in the usual care arm and estimate relative risks using log -binomial 
regression. Robust variances estimates will be used to account for within -subject correlation due 
to re-randomized subjects contributing more than on e observation period. If differences are 
observed in the distribution of EMR -derived subject characteristics across arms despi[INVESTIGATOR_722309], we will adjust for the relevant covariates in the regression models. Subject 
characteristics of interest include  age, race, ethnicity, length of health plan enrollment before 
randomization, etc.  
 
To evaluate predictors of screening uptake, we will use log -binomial regression to estimate the 
effects of subject characteristics on the probability of screening uptake. T o test for effect 
modification by [CONTACT_63615] (i.e., to test if home HPV screening is more effective at 
increasing uptake than usual care for subgroups of women), we will test characteristic -by-
randomization arm interaction terms using log -binomial r egression comparing the relative risk of 
screening uptake in the intervention arm relative to the usual care arm by [CONTACT_830189]: March 17, [ADDRESS_1152185].  
 
In an exploratory analysis, positive predictive value (PPV) of an abnormal screening test for 
detecting CIN 2+  will be estimated within each arm. The denominator will include women who 
receive an abnormal screening result within 6 months of randomization that warrants referral to 
colposcopy, and the numerator will include women with diagnosed CIN 2+. We will also 
calculate PPV restricting the denominator to women who receive colposcopy within 6 months of 
the abnormal screening result.  
 
5.2.2 Analysis plans relevant to secondary objectives four (1.2.4) and five (1.2.5)  
 
Through surveys and in -depth interviews of women in the in -home HPV screening arm, we will 
identify patient experiences and attitudes that are associated with in -home HPV testing uptake 
and complete follow up of hrHPV+ test results. We will describe frequency distributions of 
responses to survey questions a bout patient experiences and attitudes (aligned with our 
conceptual model –adapted from Andersen -Aday20–22 & Proctor23). We will transcribe, code and 
analyze the semi -structured interviews to examine experiences and attitudes related to timely 
completion of follow up of hrHPV+ results.  Together with the system -level impact data, these 
results will provide important information about how multi -level systems can support timely 
follow up for hrHPV+ women, and areas for additional educational intervention.  
 
6. ADVERSE EVENTS:  REP ORTING REQUIR EMENTS  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1152186] clinical procedures such as Pap, human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) or 
other sexually transmitted di sease testing.  Based on our own previous and ongoing studies and 
numerous other prior studies involving self -collected vaginal swabs, we expect adverse events 
will be rare and minor in severity.  The study questionnaires and interviews also present minima l 
risk to subjects as they do not address highly sensitive information.  As such, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_830179]’s primary care teams.  Both reviewing ins titutional review boards for 
this study (University of Washington and Kaiser Permanente Washington) have ruled in 
agreement with this assessment.  
 
Discomfort and light bleeding are the expected adverse events (AEs). In our previous University 
of Washington  studies of in -home HPV testing, light bleeding was reported by a small minority 
of subjects who used in -home HPV test kits (less frequent than bleeding from standard Pap 
testing). We have no plan for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_830180] -report to the study hotline or primary care teams, and do not expect that the number 
of reports of bleeding would exceed the frequency of bleeding from standard Pap testing.  All 
adverse events will be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_941] P rincipal Investigator.  
 
Toxicities and adverse events will be assessed using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for 
Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE; see Appendix A).  
Revision: March 17, [ADDRESS_1152187] be document ed in the adverse event 
(AE) case report form (CRF).  
 
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_830190], or via report to their 
Kaiser Permanente provider (providers will report AEs to study staff).  All AEs reported to study 
staff, regardless of causality, must be recorded immediately in the AE CRF.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_817925] a medical monitor that will be responsible for following 
AEs that are serious or that cause the patient to discontinue before completing the study, through 
an appropriate health care option.  The patient should be followed until the event resolves or 
stabilizes.  Frequency of follow -up is at the discretion of the medical monitor.  The medical 
monitor must follow the clinical course of each AE u ntil resolution or stabilization. Serious AEs 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to final outcome.  
 
6.3 Reporting the Intensity of an Adverse Event  
 
The intensity of an AE will be described and graded per NCI Common Terminology Criteria  for 
Adverse Events  CTC AE v3.0  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf) .  
 
6.4 Reporting the Relationship of an Adverse Event to intervention  
 
The medical monitor will determine the assessment of the causal relati onship of the event to 
study intervention using the following guidelines:  
 
 Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
All adverse events, regardless of severity, will be classified as expected or unexpected and 
reported to the Kaiser Permanente Washington Human Subjects Review Committee, per current 
Kaiser Permanente Washington Human Subjects Review Committee Incident Guidelines.

7. STUDY OVERSIGHT AND DATA REPORTING / REG ULATORY 
REQUIREMENTS  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1152188] be reviewed and approved in 
writing by a properly constituted independent Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) prior to any patient being registered on this study.  
 
7.2 Informed Consent  
 
7.2.1 Prima ry objective and secondary objectives one (1.2.1), two (1.2.2), and three (1.2.3)  
 
All consent conduct in compliance with Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46 (45 CFR 
part 46). To reduce participation bias, all eligible women will be enrolled int o the trial under a 
waiver of consent. Informed consent of intervention arm kit recipi[INVESTIGATOR_830181] a waiver of 
documentation of consent. Intervention arm women will have the ability to opt -out of having 
their individual -level medical record data used i n the research, but passive consent will be 
utilized which will significantly enhance the generalizability of the findings.  
 
7.2.2 Secondary objectives four (1.2.4) and five (1.2.5) (surveys and in -depth interviews of 
women in the in -home HPV screening arm)  
 
In compliance with [ADDRESS_1152189] be approved by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_830182](s), b efore the revision or amendment may be implemented.  The only circumstance in 
which the amendment may be initiated without regulatory approval is for a change necessary to 
eliminate an apparent and immediate hazard to the patient.  In that event, the inves tigator must 
notify the IRB in writing per current IRB rules.  
 
7.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
An interim data look at the kit return rate in the intervention arm will be reviewed by [CONTACT_830191] 6 weeks after reaching 50% of the expected target ac crual; a kit return rate of >10% is 
set as the threshold for continuing the trial because a lower return rate will make the intervention 
not clinically viable.  
 
Study staff involved in interim data activities will not be involved in any scientific decision s 
about modifications to the study protocol, but may consult with an external scientific advisory 
committee if review of study data raises any potential ethical concerns. Membership on the

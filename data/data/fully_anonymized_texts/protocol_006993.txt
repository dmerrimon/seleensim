Study protocol with statistical analysis plan  
Significance  
People with advanced Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) commonly 
experience functional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms that interfere with eating ( mealtime 
difficulties),1-[ADDRESS_1215025] in residential care settings (residents) , 94% are at risk for 
malnutrition and 66.5% are already malnourished.7, [ADDRESS_1215026]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_870189], 
residents are not provided with optimal mealtime care.12, 15, 16 Person-centered mealtime care 
(PCMC) is individually tailored to residents based on their preferences and levels of 
independence, in contrast to task -centered mealtime care (TCMC) that focuses on completion of 
tasks regardless of resident preferences  and abilities .17-19 The PCMC  features individualized, 
resident-oriented care through adherence to four principles : 1) provid ing choices and 
acknowledging  preferences, 2) showing respect, 3) supporting independence, and 4) promoting  
social interaction.10-12, 20 Our preliminary studies  show that positive  staff engagement and social 
interaction with residents  is associated with reduced mealtime difficulties and improved intake.10-
12, 14 While PCMC is highly recommended, PCMC  strategies haven’t been empi[INVESTIGATOR_870190] .21-24 A gap exists in creating  effective individualized PCMC  interventions to  
optimize mealtime care quality  and resident outcomes. 
 
Objectives  
This study  developed  and refined  OPTIMAL, and evaluated its feasibility, fidelity, and 
usefulness. The specific aims are: 
1. Develop, evaluate, and refine OPTIMAL intervention protocol and training materials. We 
will integrate evidence from  literature and our prior work  to develop the intervention protocol 
and training materials , addressing resident mealtime difficulties, targeted PCMC strategies, 
and establishment of individualized PCMC plans. We will conduct separate focus group  
interview s of staff and famil y participants on the acceptability  and appropriateness  of the 
intervention  protocol  and training materials  before pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]. Data obtained will be used to 
refine the intervention protocol and training materials before pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124].  
2. D etermine feasibility, fidelity, and usefulness of OPTIMAL. Feasibility  on participant 
identification, recruitment, consent, and retention will be evaluated descriptively . Fidelity  will be 
assessed on a) delivery  of treatment (staff attendance to training sessions), b) receipt of 
treatment (staff knowledge and self-efficacy post-training), and c) enactment of treatment skills 
(quality of staff engagement). We will conduct focus group interview s of staff to assess the 
usefulness  of OPTIMAL after T3.  
3. Describe resident outcomes (Exploratory). We will measure and describe resident mealtime 
difficulties, eating performance, intake success rate, and body mass index  using descriptive 
statistics  over time for two treatment groups. D ata obtained will inform estimates of effect sizes 
for a future larger-scale trial.   
 
Design  
We used m ixed methods (i.e., focus groups, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_516535]-group repeated measures)  to refine 
and test OPTIMAL. W e collected repeated measures at 3 time points: baseline (T1), immediately 
post intervention ([ADDRESS_1215027] baseline, T2), and 6-week post intervention ([ADDRESS_1215028] 
baseline, T3). At each time point, we assess ed quality of staff engagement and resident outcomes  
including eating performance and BMI through collection and coding of videotaped observations 
of dyadic mealtime interaction (videos; Aim 2&3) over 6 meals in 2 consecutive days (2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, 2 dinners) for each staff-resident dyad. We used Cue Utilization and Engagement in 
Dementia (CUED) mealtime video coding scheme, an innovative, feasible, and reliable tool that 
our team has developed and validated, and assessed resident mealtime challenging behaviors  
including resistive behaviors and functional impairments  and intake success rate  using videos 
collected in this study.11, 25 
 
Methods 
Development  of OPTIMAL  (Aim 1). OPTIMAL is designed to teach staff to effectively manage 
mealtime difficulties and engage residents in eating to restore and maintain their highest level of function possible. We developed OPTIMAL  following the  four PCMC  principles : 1) providing 
choices  & acknowledging preferences (i.e., offering opportunities to make choices,  providing and 
delivering  food in ways personally acceptable and culturally appropriate), 2) supporting 
independence (i.e., providing appropriate technical, motivational, instrumental, and informational assistance based on residents’ functional ability), 3) showing respect (i.e., honoring and valuing 
residents when assisting them ), and 4) promoting social interactions (i.e., making connections 
with residents , creating/fostering a social environment with low stimul i and positive 
engagement) .
10-12, [ADDRESS_1215029] significant barrier in providing optimal mealtime care 
in terms of assessing residents’ preferences, interacting with residents, and modifying the over -
stimulated environment.[ADDRESS_1215030] by [CONTACT_870200]-related electronic databases (Pubmed, CINAHL, AgeLine, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library ) 
between [ADDRESS_1215031] identified 98 unique mealtime difficulties 
categorized in four types of symptoms (behavioral, functional, cognitive, mixed), in which [ADDRESS_1215032] commonly described and addressed by 260 unique behavioral multilevel strategies. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_870191] 3 steps : 1) updating evidence based on literature from [ADDRESS_1215033]; 2) integrating 
findings from the updated review, our preliminary studies  (see 4C1), and our current R03 study 
that examines patterns of and temporal relationships between staff PCMC &TCMC behaviors and 
resident mealtime difficulties and intake (see 2A); and 3) synthesizing all  the above evidence. The 
training materials will ad dress  three components of OPTIMAL: a) Why and What: rationale, 
benefits, and PCMC principles, b) How (basic): resident common mealtime difficulties and targeted behavioral multilevel PCMC strategies; and c) How (advanced): establishment of individualized PCMC plans based on assessments of common mealtime difficulties and use of targeted multilevel PCMC  strategies.  
Evaluation and Refinement of OPTIMAL (Ai m 1). After the intervention protocol and training 
materials are developed, w e conducted one focus group of NH stakeholders including leadership, 
staff, and families  to prioritize the multiple mealtime difficulties identified from literature and to 
understand the acceptability  of the OPTIMAL intervention following an interview guide. The focus 
group was audio-recorded, and facilitated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_870192]. Data obtained were  analyzed and used to refine the intervention protocol and training 
materials before pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124].  
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (Aim 2 and 3). Participants  including staff, residents, and families 
were recruited from nursing homes.  Staff are eligible if they are [ADDRESS_1215034] twice a week over the previous month. Families are 
eligible if they are 18 years old or above, English speaking, a family member of the resident who 
is living at the NH study site at the time of the study , having experiences of delivering mealtime 
care to their resident family members, and providing  informed consent.  
Residents  are eligible if they: 1) are ≥ 55 years, 2) diagnosed as having ADRD based on 
medical records, 3) identified by [CONTACT_870201], and 4) having a 
legally authorized representative (LAR) providing informed written consent. Whether the 
resident needs mealtime assistance is based on medical record review as well as proxy report from the NH staff who has recently cared for the resident at mealtimes using the “feeding” item of the Katz ADL Index. Specifically, residents  who need varied levels of assistance with feeding 
(limited, extensive, total assistance) are eligible, and those who get food from plate into mouth 
without help are excluded regardless of who prepares food. Residents will be excluded if they: 
1) have a documented diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, or swallowing disorder, 2) do not eating orally (e.g., parenteral/IV feedings, use of feeding tubes), 3) unable to hear or see staff even with glasses and/or hearing aids  (e.g., uncorrected visual or heari ng 
impairment), or 4) stay in the NH study site for less than 12 weeks at the time of recruitment/consent/assent (e.g., terminally ill receiving hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249], and/or receiving post-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870193]) that may not allow enough time for obtaining consent/assent, and 
scheduling days for video recording sessions across three time points (baseline, and 6- and 12- 
weeks post baseline) . 
 
Recruitment and Consent (Aim 2 and 3).  To enroll staff and families, we will adapt a standard 
consent protocol for NH dementia mealtime research developed based on our prior study.12 To 
enroll residents, w e will use a consent & assent protocol for research involving NH residents with 
dementia and their legally authorized representatives (LAR s).29 Briefly, proxy informed consent 
will be obtained from the eligible resident’s LAR , and assent from the resident afterwards . Detailed 
plan is described in the PHS HSCTI , 2.5 Recruitment and Retention Plan.  
 
OPTIMAL  intervention (Aim 2 and 3).  A research assistant (OPTIMAL interventionist) will be 
trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_870194]. To assure sustainability 
of OPI[INVESTIGATOR_870195], we  will identify a staff champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (a staff participant who is a lead nursing 
assistant or licensed practical nurse) in each NH to work with the OPTIMAL interventionist during 
the intervention period. T he interventionist will train all  staff participants  to implement OPTIMAL  
through 3 phases: I) one training session, II) ongoing mentoring to establish/ refine PCMC  plans, 
and III) two biweekly facilitations of OPTIMAL care delivery . Phases  will be implemented 
sequentially, although they will overlap in that, once initiated, they will continue throughout the 
intervention period.  
      In Phase I , all staff participants  from one NH will attend an in-person 2-hour  group training 
session led by [CONTACT_870202], role 
modeling/playing, practic ing with each other, and demonstration and  application of skills in 
individualized PCMC care planning. All staff  participants  will be provided with training materials 
to be developed by [CONTACT_870203] 1(see 4C 4). If a staff is not able to attend the group session, 
we will record reasons of no attendance and schedule a make -up individual  training session  led 
by [CONTACT_139230]. By [CONTACT_870204], staff participants are expected to be 
able to 1) assess common mealtime difficulties and d escribe the use of targeted PCMC strategies, 
and 2) develop PCMC plans to address observed mealtime difficulties with targeted strategies . 
Staff will complete a PCMC -related  knowledge and self-efficacy test to  be developed based on 
training materials pre - and post-training session.  Adequate receipt of the OPTIMAL  training is 
indicated by a total test score of ≥ 75% post-training.30, [ADDRESS_1215035] score of 
<75% post-training will attend booster training sessions ( in group or individual  format) until the 
individual staff receive a  total test score of ≥ 75% . 
      The OPTIMAL interventionist will initiate Phase II, individual ized PCMC  planning, working 
closely with staff and resident participants. The interventionist will assess e ach resident’s  eating 
independence and mealtime difficulties  as well as staff use of PCMC &TCMC strategies  during 
the first week of the OPTIMAL intervention. After assessment, the interventionist will record major 
mealtime difficulties demonstrated by [CONTACT_347229], strategies used that do (not) work, and any 
barriers to implementing specific strategies . The interventionist will then develop a PCMC care 
plan for  each  resident by [CONTACT_870205]. The primary goal is to engage residents to be actively involved in eating and 
initiate each intake attempt by [CONTACT_870206]. For example, a care plan for a resident demonstrating prolonged chewing may include 
offering food bites of smaller size, offering drinks frequently to flush food down, and giving short, simple verbal cues. Another example is that for a resident with difficulty using utensil properly, the 
care plan may include preloading utensils, offering finger food, and providing adaptive utensils. 
The interventionist will work with the staff participants to identify  possible solutions to eliminate 
any barriers to implement specific PCMC strategies , the best places  to store/locate the care plans , 
as well as  the best way for staff participants to review residents’  updated care plans in each NH.  
      After individualized PCMC care plans are established, Phase III, biweekly facilitations of 
OPTIMAL care, will be provided to each staff participant twice over [ADDRESS_1215036]  will observe each staff participant in 
providing care to a resident during one meal, and provide  role m odeling as well as  feedback on 
how well the staff follows and implements the care plan. In this phase, individualized PCMC care 
plans will be updated continuously  based on assessments  of resident mealtime difficulties . 
 
Data Collection Procedures (Aim 1, 2, 3; Table 1). In each NH, i mmediately  after written  
consents  of staff and family participants are obtained,  separate focus groups  for staff and families 
will be scheduled and conducted (see 4C4b. Aim 1), and participants ’ characteristics  will be 
collected using a demographic survey (4C7)  before T1. R esidents  will be recruited with written 
assents /consents from residents and their LARs. Resident characteristics will be collected by 
[CONTACT_458939] . Feasibility data about identification, recruitment, consent, and 
retention of all participants will be gathered throughout the study (see 4C8a, Aim 2 ). A trained 
research videographer  will schedule a 1-day practice recording session for each  resident  
participant using a mini handheld digital video recorder. Adequate quality recordings for 
behavioral analyses have been obtained with a mini digital camera in prior research.
32, 33 After  the 
practice session, the videographer  will schedule a 2 -day formal recording session for each 
resident participant at baseline (T1), and at 6- (T2) and 12-week post baseline (T3), respectively  
(Aim 2&3). We will videotape mealtime only in the scheduled days  of all recording sessions . Staff 
participants will complete a knowledge & self-efficacy test  pre- and post- OPTIMAL training 
sessions (Aim 2). At each time point, in addition to mealtime video recording, a trained data 
collector will collect body mass index (BMI) of each resident, and complete observational 
measures on quality of staff engagement and resident eating performance for each of the 6 meals 
in 2 days in the NH (Aim 2&3). After T3, we will conduct one  focus group in each NH ( Aim 3 ), 
lasting  50-60 minutes, audio-recorded, and facilitated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_870196] .

Sample Characteristics (Aim 1, 2, 3). Resident characteristics include age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, education, dementia stage. Staff and families  characteristics  include  age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, education, job title (staff only) , and length of caregiving.   
 Feasibility, Fidelity, and Usefulness Data (Aim 2)   
Feasibility of OPTIMAL . Descriptive data on  identification, recruitment, consent,  and retention 
of staff, resident,  and famil y participants will be gathered to assess  intervention feasibility
34-36 (see 
Appendix 5). In addition to the number of participants screened and eligible for the study, the 
recruiter will track  reasons  for those unwilling to participate in the study , and whether  that is 
specifically related to video recording  and/or  OPTIMAL interventi on. We will record the  number of 
participants deemed not eligible and reasons for ineligibility as a basis for planning future trials of 
OPTIMAL . The length of time it takes to obtain  assent s/consents  from residents, staff, families, 
and LARs, as well as the number of families and LARs who don’t mail back their written consent 
within expected time period (i.e., 2 week s after they receive blank consent forms  by [CONTACT_2319] ) will be 
tracked. Families/ LARs will be contact[CONTACT_870207]. We will track  the number of 
residents  and staff requiring reschedul ing of video recordi ng sessions and the reasons for 
reschedul ing. We will track the number of resident and staff participants  who withdraw at various 
time points (e.g., before , during,  and after T1, T2, and T3), and those who withdraw  will be 
contact[CONTACT_870208].  
Fidelity of OPTIMAL . We will assess three aspects  of fidelity37: 1) delivery  of treatment, tracking 
staff attendance at the group or individual training sessions  using a checklist, 2) receipt  of 
treatment, indicated by a total test score of ≥ 75% on the staff PCMC -related knowledge & self-
efficacy test post-training with or without booster sessions  (we will track the number of group or 
individual booster sessions offered in each NH) , and 3) enactment of treatment skills , including 
quality of staff engagement assessed by [CONTACT_941] 19-item Mealtime Engagement Scale38 developed 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_870197]  (each item is scored on 0-3, total score range: 0-
57, higher score = higher quality of engagement).   
Usefulness of OPTIMAL. Staff perceived usefulness of  the OPTIMAL intervention  (OPTIMAL 
group) or OPTIMAL training session  (education control group) will be assessed using semi -
structured focus group  interview s. Open-ended questions  focus on experiences in delivering 
OPTIMAL care , use of PCMC -related strategies, strategies that do (not) work, and suggestions 
of refinement for OPTIMAL (see Appendix 7). 
 
Resident outcomes (Aim 3) 
Resident mealtime difficulties. We will code videos using CUED that has codes for  resident 
mealtime difficulties grouped into three types : 1) chewing and swallowing difficulties represented 
by 4 behaviors (e.g., holds food in mouth), 2) functional impairment represented by 5 behaviors 
(e.g., difficulty using utensil), and 3) resistiveness  to care represented by 6 behaviors (e.g., 
doesn’t open mouth). Coded data will be used to calculate the number of resident mealtime 
difficulties  by [CONTACT_870209] .  
Resident eating performance. We will use the 9-item Level of Eating Independence scale (see 
appendix 8) to assess the ability of independence with eating and drinking activities during cycles of verbal prompts
39. Each item is scored from 1 (total dependence) to 4 (total independence), with 
total score ranging from 9 to 36 (higher score = more independence). The inter -rater reliability 
was 0.96.39 
Resident intake success rate. We will code videos using CUED to track  whether the resident or 
staff initiates/ completes each intake attempt, and whether there is a subsequent intake  after each 
attempt. We will calculate r esident intake success rate through dividing  the number of intake 
attempts initiated/ completed by [CONTACT_870210].  
Resident Body Mass Index ( BMI). We will assess body weight in the early morning before 
breakfast with each indiv idual resident dressing casual indoor clothes without shoes  using the 
same digital body scale throughout the study . We will assess  body weight twice in one early 
morning of each time point and calculate the average of the two assessments for BMI .  
Behavioral Coding Procedures for Videos. All videos will be computer archived and coded 
second-by -second by [CONTACT_870211]® 14.[ADDRESS_1215037] CUED  
coding manual established by [CONTACT_2296] . Detailed training and coding procedures are described 
in PHS HSCTI , 4.4 Statistical Design and Power. Coded data on resident mealtime difficulties 
and intake process will be exported from Noldus Observer® to excel worksheets, and then 
imported to SAS 9.440 for us to calculate the number  of mealtime difficulties, and intake success 
rate. 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Develop, evaluate, and refine OPTIMAL intervention protocol and training materials (Ai m 
1). We developed OPTIMAL through systematic integration of four PCMC principles,10-12, 20 our 
prior work on multilevel facilitators and barriers to engaging residents in eating, and our systematic 
review of mealtime difficulties and targeted behavioral strategies. We integrated evidence from 
literature and our prior work  to develop the intervention protocol and training materials, addressing 
resident mealtime difficulties, targeted PCMC strategies, and establishment of individualized 
PCMC plans. We conducted focus group interviews of staff participants on the acceptability and 
appropriateness of the intervention protocol and training materials before pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]. Based on 
staff overall comments, the OPTIMAL components were highly evaluated as timely and fit to the 
needs of care practice. Data obtained were used to refine the intervention protocol and training 
materials before pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124].  
Determine feasibility, fidelity, and usefulness of OPTIMAL (Aim 2 ). We described  feasibility 
data on participant identification, recruitment, consent and retention, including the number of and 
reasons for participants’ ineligibility, unwillingness to participate, not consenting/assenting, not 
returning written consent within expected time period, and attrition/withdrawal. We used this 
information to refine study procedures for a future larger trial to facilitate recruitment and retention. 
We described treatment fidelity, including staff attendance at training sessions  and staff PCMC -
related knowledge scores pre- and post-training. Audio-recorded focus group interviews from staff 
(usefulness)  were  transcribed41 and coded42. We extracted codes using open coding (using staff’s 
own words)42, 43 to address the usefulness and areas of refinement of OPTIMAL.  
Describe resident outcomes ( Aim 3). We described distributions of resident eating 
performance, mealtime challenging behaviors including resistive behaviors and functional 
impairments , intake success rate, and BMI using appropriate descriptive statistics (mean, median, 
mode, range, variance, SD, percentile and quartile ranks, n, %) over time. These data were  used 
to inform estimates of effect sizes for sample size calculation in a future trial.   
 
Expected Outcomes and Impact for Future Trials. Using mixed methods, qualitative and 
quantitative data will be collected and analyzed to refine OPTIMAL intervention protocol, training 
materials , and study procedures, and to understand its feasibility, fidelity , and usefulness . Data 
obtained from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_870198]  a future large r efficacy 
trial. They are: 1) refined OPTIMAL intervention protocol and training materials with preliminary 
evidence of feasibility, fidelity, and  usefulness ; 2) refined study procedures  for recruitment, 
retention, data collection, and recording and behavioral coding of videos; 3) evidence of feasibility 
for a two-group parallel cluster RCT design with three repeated measures (baseline, 6-&12-weeks  
post baseline); 4)  effect size estimates of resident outcomes for sample size calculation; and 5) 
videotaped observations collected in this study  to be used in  future staff training sessions to 
illustrate OPTIMAL care skills.  
Limitations. As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], a small sample of staff and residents from [ADDRESS_1215038] a new behavioral intervention, prior to  a large-scale  
efficacy trial .

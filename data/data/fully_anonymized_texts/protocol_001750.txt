Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of terms
Baseline Observed values/findings which are regarded observed starting point for 
comparison. 
Clinical response for 
subjects aged from 
birth to < 2 years Absence of watery diarrhea for 2 consecutive days during treatment and 
subjects remain well until the time of study drug discontinuation (initial 
clinical response). 
In addition, subjects should not require further CDAD therapy within 2 days 
after completion of study drug (confirmed clinical response). Resolution of 
diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the subject/parent/legal guardian 
supplemented by a review of the subject’s personal records for the day (if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]), and the presence of watery diarrhea.
Clinical response for 
subjects aged ≥ 2 
years to < 18 yearsImprovement in the number and character of bowel movements as 
determined by < 3 unformed bowel movements (UBMs) per day for 2 
consecutive days during treatme nt and subjects remain well until the time of 
study drug discontinuation (initial clinical response). 
In addition, subjects should not require further CDAD therapy 2 days after 
completion of study drug (confirmed clinical response). Resolution of 
diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the subject/parent/legal guardian, 
supplemented by a review of the subject’s personal records for the day (if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]), and the number of UBMs.
Enroll To register or enter into a clinical trial. NOTE: Once a subject has been 
enrolled, the clinical trial protocol applies to the subject. 
End of Study The end of the study is defined as the date of the last subject’s last visit /TC. 
Intervention The drug, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study. (e.g., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety, pharmacoeconomics).
Investigational period Period of time where major interests of protocol objectives  are observed, and 
where the test drug or comparative drug is given to a subject, and continues 
until the last assessment after completing administration of the test drug or 
comparative drug.
Post investigational 
periodPeriod of time after the last assessment of the protocol. Follow -up
observations for sustained adverse events and/or survival are done in this 
period.
Randomization The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control gro ups using 
an element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Recurrence for 
subjects aged from 
birth to < [ADDRESS_1058884] testing for the presence of toxigenic C.difficile in 
stool and that, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would require retreatment with 
CDAD anti -infective therapy.
Recurrence for 
subjects aged ≥ 2 The re -establishment of diarrhea after confirmed clinical response to an 
extent (as measured by [CONTACT_771379]) that is greater than that 
noted on the last day of study drug with positive direct or indirect testing for

Name [CONTACT_26323]: Fidaxomicin Phase of Development: 3
Title of Study:  
A Phase 3, Multicenter , Investigator -blind , Randomized, Parallel Group Study to Investigate the 
Safety and Efficacy of Fidaxomicin Oral Suspension or Tablets Taken q12h, andVancomycin Oral 
Liquid or Capsules Taken q6h, for 10 Days in Pediatric Subjects with Clostridium difficile -
associated Diarrhea
Planned Study Period: 
From 3Q 20 14to 2Q 2017
Study Objective(s): 
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the clinical response to fidaxomicin oral 
suspension or tablets and vancomycin oral liquid or capsules of pediatric subjects with Clostridium 
difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) from birth to < 18 year sof age .
Planned Total Number of Study Centers and Location(s):  
Approximately 65-80 centers in North America and Europe .
Study Population:  
Male and female subjects from birth to < [ADDRESS_1058887] in stool or positive detection of toxigenic C. difficile in stool .
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:  
144 subjects from birth to <[ADDRESS_1058888] 24 subjects in each of the 
following age categories: birth to <24 months , ≥2 years to < 6 years , ≥6 years to < 12 years ,and 
≥12 years to < 18 years (the remaining 48 subjects can be enrolled in any of the age groups).
Study Design Overview :  
This multicenter , investigator -blind , randomized parallel group study will investigate the safety 
and efficacy of a 10- day course of fidaxomicin oral suspension or tablets anda 10-day course of 
vancomycin oral liquid or capsules in subjects from birth to <18 years of age with confirmed 
CDAD. Note that in the [LOCATION_002] of America subjects can only be included if aged ≥ 6 months 
to < 18 years.
One hundred forty four subjects, stratified by [CONTACT_771380] ( birth to < 24 months, ≥ 2years to 
<6 years, ≥ 6 years to < 12 years, and ≥ 12 years to < 18 years) will be enrolled. A minimum of [ADDRESS_1058889] been diagnosed with 
CDAD. 
Subjects will be randomized to either fidaxomicin or vancomycin in a 2:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_135911] .
Subjects from birth to <6 years of age will be randomized to receive weight based doses of either 
fidaxomicin oral suspension (32 mg/kg/day with a ma ximum dose of 400 mg/day, divided in 
2doses) 2 times daily for 10 days, or vancomycin oral liquid (40 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose 
of 500 mg/day divided in 4doses) 4 times daily for 10 days.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Study Design Overview continued :  
Subjects aged ≥ 6years to<[ADDRESS_1058891] aged ≥ 6years to <[ADDRESS_1058892] igator can 
decide to give fidaxomicin oral suspension, at adose of 400 mg/day, or vancomycin oral liquid at a
dose of 500 mg/day.
Plasma and stool samples will be analyzed for fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP -[ADDRESS_1058893] to be collected on the same day. For all subjects a stool sample will be taken between 
Day 5 and 10 inclusive, within 24 hours of a dose .
At End of Treatment ( EOT ), subjects will be evaluated for initial clinical response (see Definition 
of Key Study Terms section) and two days thereafter for confirmed clinical response. Clinic al 
responses will be based on the investigator’s assessment of clinical par ameters, most importantly 
resolution of diarrhea and the need for further treatment for CDAD. 
Subjects without initial clinical response at EOT will enter the Follow -up period for safety (adverse 
events) and will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (visit or telephone call [TC] ) at EOS (EOT +30 days ).
Subjects without confirmed clinical response at EOT + 2 days will continue in the Follow -up 
period for safety (adverse events) and will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (visit or TC) at EO S.
Subjects who have a confirmed clinical response will be followed for recurrence and sustained 
clinical response (see Defi nition of Key Study Terms section) throughout the F ollow -up period, 
with weekly visits or TCs. At the end of the 30 day F ollow -up period the EOS TC / visit will take 
place.
If diarrhea recurs during the Follow -up period an Unscheduled visit will take place for reassess -
ment of CDAD recurrence. If recurrence is confirmed, subjects will continue in the Follow -up 
period for safety (adverse events) andwill be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (visit or TC) at the EOS.

days after the EOT, and at End of Study (EOS) EOT + 30 days, following a standardized 
questionnaire. These interviews m ay be conducted by [CONTACT_756] (e.g. when not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]). 
Palatability will be assessed  for all subjects receiving fidaxomicin oral suspension and vancomycin 
oral liquid.
Site and S ponsor staff involved in dispensing , administering or collecting the study drug will be 
unblinded as well as the subject and parents/legal guardians. They will be instructed not to discuss 
the study drug with the blinded staff.
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established for this study.

Definitions :
Clinical response for subjects aged from birth to < 2 years is defined as: Absence of watery 
diarrhea for 2 consecutive days during treatment and subjects remain well until the time of study 
drug discontinuation (initial clinical response). In addition, subjects should not require further 
CDAD therapy within 2 days after completion of study drug (confirmed clinical response). 
Resolution of diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the subject/parent/legal guardian 
supplemented by a review of the subject’s personal records for the day (if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]), and the 
presence of watery diarrhea.
Clinical response for subjects aged ≥ 2 years to < 18 years is defined as:  Improvement in the 
number and character of bowel movements as determin ed by < 3 unformed bowel movements 
(UBMs) per day for 2 consecutive days during treatment and subjects remain well until the time of 
study drug discontinuation (initial clinical response). In addition, subjects should not require further 
CDAD therapy 2 days after completion of study drug (confirmed clinical response). Resolution of 
diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the subject/parent/legal guardian, supplemented by a 
review of the subject’s personal records for the day (if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]), and the num ber of UBMs.
Time to resolution of diarrhea (TTROD) for subjects aged from birth to < 2 years is defined as:  
the time elapsing (in hours rounded up from minutes > 30) from the start of treatment (time of first 
dose of study medication) to resolution of di arrhea (time of last epi[INVESTIGATOR_771337] 2 consecutive days without watery diarrhea that was sustained through EOT).
Time to resolution of diarrhea (TTROD ) for subjects aged ≥ 2 years to < 18 years is defined

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 21 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Back ground
Fidaxomicin is a macrolide (18 -membered macrocy cle) antibacterial drug produced by  
[CONTACT_771387] , and has a highly  potent y et narrow -spectrum bactericidal 
activity  against Clostridium diff icile.Fidaxomicin was approved b y the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in May  2011 for the U nited States (US) and in December 2011 by  [CONTACT_771388] (EU) for the treatment of C.difficile infection 
(CDI) also known as C. difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults, and is now being 
developed for use in pediatric patients with the same condition. 
CDAD is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea in developed countries .The 
disease accounts for approximately  20% of cases of an tibiotic -associated diarrhea, and for the 
majority  of cases of antibiotic -associated pseudomembranous colitis [Blanckaert et al, 2008; 
Calfee 2008; Monaghan et al, 2008; My lonakis et al, 2001 ].Although ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_771340] -term car e facilities, CD ADmay also be acquired in the community .  
While not nearly as common as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired CD AD, community -acquired CD ADis 
afflicting otherwise healthy  people with no recent history  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771341][Monaghan et al, 2008; Bartlett, 2006; Kuijper et al, 2006; My lonakis et al, 2001]. One 
study  reported that approximately  50% of patients with CD ADwho visited a general 
practitioner in 2006 acquired the disease outside of a healthcare setting [Weil et al, 2007 ]
C. diffici leis a spore -forming, anaerobic, gram- positive bacillus. CD AD is caused b y an 
overgrowth of C. difficile in the colon often resulting from antibiotic use that disrupts the 
beneficial microflora found in the gut, allowing C. difficile to proliferate. The r ising 
incidence of CD ADhas been attributed to the frequent prescription of broad -spectrum
antibiotics to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], the increasing incidence of virulent strains (such as the 
North American PFGE pulse -field gel electrophoresis type 1 [NAP1] /restriction endo -
nuclease anal ysis type BI ( Epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] h ypervirulent C. difficile strain)/ Polymerase C hain 
Reaction riboty pe 027 or NAP1/BI/027), [Kuijper et al, 2006; Kuijper et al, 2008] or less 
commonly  to cancer chemotherapy [Feket y, 1997] . Antibiotics 
commonly  linked to CDAD 
include ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312], amoxicillin, clindamy cin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins,
[Wistrom et al, 2001; Fekety, 1997] but almost all antibiotics can induce CDAD.  Once 
overgrown, C.difficile produces harmful toxins that can cause a variet y of complications, 
including pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, perforations of the colon, and sepsis, 
and can cause or contribute to death in up to 14.4% of cases [Loo et al, 2005]. Recent reports 
mostly  in adults suggest that CDAD is evolving into a more severe disease. Outbreaks of 
CDAD with increased morbidity  and mortalit y have been described in North America and in 
the EU [Ackermann et al, 2004 ].These outbreaks were associated with the emergence and 
dissemination of a hy pervirulent strain characterized as toxinoty peIII, NAP1/BI /027. The 
NAP1/BI/027 strain has been reported in the US, Canada, and Northern Europe [Blanckaert 
et al, 2008; Calfee 2008; Kuijper et al, 2006]. This strain is thought to be responsible for 
increasing morbidit y and mortality . It contains an 18- base pair tcdC deletion, and has been 
shown in vitro to produce 16 to 23 times more toxins A and B than other strains [Monaghan

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2et al, 2008; Credito & Appelbaum, 2004] .To date, hy pervirulent strains of C. difficile have 
been identified in the US, Canada, Japan, and many other countries, and are of increasing 
concern [Kuijper et al, 2008].
CDADhas long been considered a disease of adults and not a clinical problem in children
[McFarland et al, 2000; Larson et al, 1982] . It is unclear whether typi[INVESTIGATOR_771342] 2 years of age. Even in older children, CD ADis associated with variable 
diarrheal sy mptoms, with some reports stating that CD ADrarely causes severe diarrhea in 
childre n [Vernacchio et al, 2006; Sp ivack et al, 2003] . However, other studies have shown 
the presence of C.difficile in a significant number of older children presenting with diarrhea; 
27.3% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771343] a positive C.difficile test in a study  in the 
US[Kader et al, 1998].
Recently , the disease has been recognized to be increasing in children and y ounger adults with a 
significant proportion of these cases exhibiting the onset of sy mptoms in the community  [DuPont 
et al, 2008; Benson et al, 2007] . These observat ions along with the emergence of a more virulent 
and possibly  more transmissible strain (NAP1/BI/027) prompted the initiation of population -
based surveillance s ystems for CDAD. The preliminary  data now emerging from these 
surveillance s ystems, as well as data from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771344], but is steadily  increasing. The most 
recent data indicate that the incidence/prevalence of CDAD in children in the US has likely  
reached a rate of approximately  20,000 cases annually  [Kuijper et al, 2008].
The most recent data on population- based surveillance of CDAD in children in the US were 
reported b y Kast and colleagues at the recent 2010 I nternational Conference on Emerging 
Infectious Diseases [Kast et al, 2010]. 
The investigator s reported the incidence of CD ADin [ADDRESS_1058918] catchment areas:  
fivemetropolitan counties in Colorado and four rural counties in Minnesota. The anal ysis 
captured both healthcare facility -onset disease and community -onset disease. The overall 
incidence of CD ADin individuals aged 1 -17 years was similar between the two areas. In the 
urban centers in Colorado, the rate was 16 per 100,000, whereas in the rural counties , the rate 
was 21 per 100,000. Adjusting for the regional differences in CD ADprevalence described b y 
Elixhauser and Jhung [ Elixhauser & Jhung, 2011] ,the rates in each surveillance area closel y 
approximate to20 per 100,000.a  The inclusion of both rural and metropolitan populations 
and the similarity  of the results across populations support the generalizability  of the data to 
the general US pediatric population. Thus, using current US census data for individuals under 
18 years of age (i.e., 74,548,215 persons aged under 5 years through 17 years) y ields a 
national incidence of approximately  15,000 cases per year based on both the rural and 
metropolitan data.
                                                
aWhen regional CDAD rates (all ages combined) w ere evaluated, the rate in the Midwest (including Minnesota) 
was slightly higher than the overall national rate (83 versus 79.3 per 100,000; 5% higher) whereas the rate in the 
West (including Colorado) w as som ewhat lower than th e national rate (62 versus 79.3 per 100,000; 20% low er).  
Adjusting the rate of 21 per 100,000 from Minnesota by 5% results in a rate of [ADDRESS_1058919] by  20% also results in a rate of 20 per 100, 000.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Lower national CD ADrates were obtained b y McDonald and colleagues based on data on 
discharges from short -stay hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5425] a period approximately  [ADDRESS_1058921] and colleagues [Kast et al, 2010; McDonald, 2006]. In the McDonald study , 
diagnoses of intestinal infection due to Clostridium difficile (ICD-9 code 8.45) between 1996 
and 2003 from the Nation al Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36669]  (NHDS) database were used to 
estimate national rates. The NHDS consists of diagnosis and demographic data collected from 
a national probability  sample of patient discharge records from approximately  500 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
An algorithm (SUDAAN ™) was used to estimate national rates. Although this study  included 
adults as well as children, rates were anal yzed by [CONTACT_164737]. The point estimate rate for 
patients <15 y ears was 9/ 100,000 (95% CI 5-9 per 100,000). Using US census data on 
indivi duals <15 years (61,882,854 persons aged under 5 years throu gh 14 yearsb), the point 
estimate of the national rate in the years between 1993 and 2003 is 5,570 cases/y ear.
The increase in the incidence of pediatric CD ADbetween time periods covered b y the 
McDonald and Kast studies is supported by  [CONTACT_771389][INVESTIGATOR_771345] [ Zilberberg , 2009 ]. Using the Kid’s Inpatient Database (KID) and the NHDS 
database, the incidence of CD ADdiagnoses between [ADDRESS_1058922] recent 
data from this study  (2006 data) indicated that the rate of CD ADamong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771346] 12.8 per 10,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771347] o n KID data and 14.03 per 
10,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771348].

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2The etiology  in children is the same as in adults with one major difference: children, 
particularl y those < 2 years of age, frequently  harbor C. di fficile while being clinically  
asymptomatic. In addition, unlike in adults and older children with CDAD ,the exclusion of 
other causes of diarrhea is not as conclusive in neonates and young babies < 6months because 
children often have underly ing gastrointestinal or immunologic diseases and children are more 
susceptible to infection by  [CONTACT_771390], for example rotavirus, many  of which cannot 
be cultured at all or only in sophisticated research labs.  
Several studies have been carried out to d etermine the culture rates in fe ces of C. difficile in 
children with and without diarrhea, with these studies showing variable culture rates and no 
apparent association between a positive culture and clinical diagnosis. I n newborn infants in 
particular (i.e., <1 month old), the occurrence of positive cultures varied widely , from 4% in 
Sweden ,11% in [LOCATION_009] , 25% in t he Netherlands, 31% in the US , 67% in Belgium , and 71% 
in the [LOCATION_006] [Penders et al, 2006; Enad et al, 1997; Collignon et al, 1993; Delmee et al, 1988;
Al-Jumaili et al, 1984; Holst et al, 1981 ].It should be noted that these results were seen in all 
newborns, with no direct correlation to the presence of diarrhea.
A 1989 study  demonstrated that C. difficile -positive cultures were obtained at a similar 
frequency  from infants of less than 1 year of age both with and without diarrhea (32.5% 
compared to 27.9%, difference not significant, p=0.44) [ Karsch et al, 1989 ]. Similarly , 
Vernacchio and colleagues demonstra ted that 3.5% ofhealth y children (aged 6 to 36 months) 
had positive C.difficile cultures, whereas the proportion of children with positive C. difficile
cultures plus diarrhea was only  1.9% (p=0.12) [ Vernacchio et al, 2006 ]. In a Finnish study , 
the preval ence of positive cultures was compared between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771352] 
(21.1%) to an y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304] (32.7%) [Vesikari et al, 1984 ].In this study  newborns 
and infants were included (i.e., patients of 0 to 2 years).
Taken together, it is clear that y oung children of all age groups frequentl y harbor C.difficile
and tolerate the presence of C.difficile, but can be clinically as ymptomatic and not develop 
CDAD. The presence of intestinal colonization with C.difficile does not necessaril y correlate 
with diarrhea in this age group.
As a possible scientific rationale for the differences in colonization and incidence of CD AD
seen in y oung children compared to adults, it has been suggested that neonates and infants do 
not respond to c lostridial toxins in the same way  as adults do [Tullus et al, 1989 ].Though the 
mechanism for this difference is unclear, h ypotheses include the inability of immature 
receptors to bind or respond to the toxins, transference of protective maternal antibodies, and 
the inability  of the infant’s immune sy stem to mount an effective immune response.
Patients are currentl y treated b y discontinuation of the offending medication, as well as 
supportive therap y, but antimicrobial therap y is required if these measures fail to con trol the 
infection (Kell y, 1994; Feket y, 1997). The two most commonly utilized specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_771353], the latter being used off -label. 
Vancom ycin is recommended for first -line treatment of CDAD in severe cases, but not in mil d 
to moderate cases, which represent the majorit y of CDAD patients (Bauer, 2009). Increasing

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2use of vancom ycin has caused some concern as it is the only antibiotic active against some 
serious life -threatening, multi -drug resistant bacteria [Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] I nfect ion Control Practices 
Advisory  Committee (HICPAC), 1995; Watanabe, 1997]. 
Metronidazole is the recommended treatment for patients with mild to moderate disease 
experiencing a first epi[INVESTIGATOR_149495] [American Society  of Health -System Pharmacists 
(ASHP), 1998; Bauer, 2009]. Metronidazole is effective in these subgroups of patients, and 
can be used either orally  or intravenousl y. However, it is near -fully  absorbed in the absence of 
diarrhea, and oral absorption is associated with significant adverse effects inc luding nausea, 
neuropath y, leukopenia, seizures, and a toxic reaction to alcohol [Kelly , 1994; Feket y, 1984, 
Feket y, 1997]. 
Furthermore, its use is discouraged in young children and pregnant women [Yassin, 2001]. 
Finally , several reports have shown a lowe r clinical response rate in severe cases when 
treated with metronidazole treatment compared to vancom ycin [Zar, 2007; Louie, 2007]. The 
current recommendations for CDAD treatment in The Medical Letter and Up -To-Date, and 
endorsed b y the recent guidelines o f the European Society  of Clinical Microbiology  and 
Infectious Diseases (ESCMI D) [Bauer, 2009] and the Society  for Healthcare Epi[INVESTIGATOR_771354] (SHEA -IDSA) [Cohen, 2010] 
state that vancom ycin, but not metronidazole, should be used to treat severe cases of CDAD. 
Although current CDI treatment options are effective in treating the acute sy mptoms, none of 
the available treatments is without significant problems. I n the case of vancomy cin, these 
problems incl ude high recurrence rate, high risk of acquiring resistant organisms, especially  
VRE. Therap y with metronidazole presents the following problems high recurrence rate, 
higher rate of failures in severe cases compared to vancom ycin, frequent adverse effects.
A major shortcoming of currentl y available antimicrobial treatments for CDI is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_771355]  20% to 50% [Kyne, 1999; Ky ne, 2001; Aslam, 2005; L ouie, 
2007; L ouie, 2006; Musher, 2006]. A new agent that effectivel y treats CDI and markedl y 
reduces recurrence would be a significant therapeutic advance. 
Fidaxomicin tablets are approved for use in the US and other countries to treat adult subjects 
with CDAD. Also due to the need for a liquid formulation for pediatric patients, an or al 
suspension formulation of fidaxomicin has been developed. 
Data from the recent pediatric PK study with fidaxomicin tablets and oral suspension suggest 
a pharmacokinetic profile that is generally  similar to that observed in adults. The safet y 
observations were consistent with both the underly ing conditions of the subjects and with 
data from prior studies in the adult CDAD population, and suggest that fidaxomicin is well 
tolerated in this population. Fidaxomicin showed strong efficacy  in treating the init ial 
disease, but higher recurrence percentage than observed in prior adult studies .The pharmaco -
kinetic, safet y, and efficacy results observed in this study  support the continuation of 
pediatric development of fidaxomicin.

In two ascending dose studies ( Studies OPT -80 1A-SD and OPT- 80 1B -MD), following single 
oral doses of 100 to 450 mg and multiple oral doses of 150 to 450 mg of fidaxomi cin to healthy  
adult volunteers, plasma levels of fidaxomicin were near the lower limit of quantification 
[LLOQ ]=5 ng/mL , showing a dose -proportional increase over the dose range studied. Plasma 
elimination half -lives ranged from 0.[ADDRESS_1058934], normalized to the 150 mg 
dose, fecal concentrations of fidaxomicin reached a mean of 916.0 μg/g (range 138.4 to 1768.9 
μg/g) after [ADDRESS_1058935]. Overall, fidaxomicin was well tolerated by  [CONTACT_771391] 450 mg. The adverse events (AEs) were comparable between active and 
placebo over the d ose range studied. There were no clinically  significant abnormalities or drug -
related changes in serum chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis throughout the study  period. 
There were no clinicall y significant abnormalities in hemody namic or electrocardiograp hic 
data collected throughout the study .
Fidaxomicin and its main metabolite, OP -1118, showed maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
values that were 21.5% and 33.4% lower, respectively, in the fed versus the fasted states, while 
extents of exposure (AUC 0-t) were equivalent (Study  OPT -80-005). The frequency , types and

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2with fidaxomicin (200 mg) in clinical studies, and these exposure levels were de monstrated to be 
safe, the increases are not considered clinically significant. Coadministration of the P -
glycoprotein inhibitor cyclosporine with fidaxomicin (Study  OPT -80-007) increased the least 
squares (LS) mean C maxof fidaxomicin and main metabolite OP-1118 by  [CONTACT_3450]  
4-fold and 10- fold, respectively , compared to fidaxomicin alone. AUC 0-tfor fidaxomicin and 
OP-1118 were also increased b y cyclosporine, but to a lesser extent (approximately 2-fold and 
4-fold, respectivel y). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_771357] s in s ystemic exposure with cyclosporine, plasma 
fidaxomicin concentrations remained low (< 27 ng/mL) and the drug was safe and well 
tolerated. Therefore, the increases in fidaxomicin concentrations that may  occur during 
concomitant treatment with cy clospo rine are unlikely  to be clinically  meaningful as s ystemic 
exposure is not relevant to the safety or efficacy of fidaxomicin which is used for CDAD, 
infections that are confined to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
In stud y OPT -80-008, subjects received a single oral dose of 0.5 mg digoxin tablets on Day s
1 and 13. All subjects also received oral fidaxomicin tablets (200 mg, q12h) on Days 8 to 18.  
When digoxin was administered 1 hour after a dose of 200 mg fidaxomicin, the L S mean 
Cmaxand AUC 0-∞values for digoxin were increased by  [CONTACT_3450]  14% and 12%, 
respectivel y, on Day  [ADDRESS_1058937] on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
When a probe cocktail of R -and S -warfarin, omeprazole, and midazolam was administered 
as a single dose with steady -state 200 mg fidaxomicin (Study  OPT -80-009), no statistically  
significant drug -drug interactions (DDI) were observed between fidaxomicin and warfarin 
isomers, omeprazole and its metabolite 5- hydroxyomeprazole, or with midazolam.
Following coadministration of rosuvastatin with fidaxomicin (Study  2819- CL-2003), a 
substrate for transporters BCRP, MRP2, and OATP2B1, with fidaxomicin (200 mg twice 
daily ) in healthy  volunteers, the rosuvastatin C max increased b y 17% and AUC 0-∞ by 9.7%. 
This effect of fidaxomicin on rosuvastatin exposure is not considered clinically  relevant and 
no dose adjustment is necessary .
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 2A Study
In the phase 2A study , fidaxomicin administered to subjec ts with CDAD twice dail y for 
10days at total daily  doses of 100, [ADDRESS_1058938] 90% of subjects receiving 400 mg/da y (200 mg q12h) 
showed total relief of symptoms at the end of treatment. There were no treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAE) that were considered to be drug-related. An analysis of time -to-
resolution of diarrhea provided additional evidence that higher doses were mor e efficacious 
than lower doses.
At the dose of 200 mg q12h (400 mg/day ), observable plasma fidaxomicin concentrations 
from Day  1 and Day  10 ranged from 5.32 to 84.9 ng/mL, while stool concentrations averaged 
over 1,400 μg/g. At the same dose, stool concentrations of fidaxomicin were approx imately

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 22-3 fold higher than OP -1118, the active metabolite, but plasma levels of OP- 1118 remained 
well below the μg/mL range (maximum value 402 ng/mL).
Microbiological evaluation of the stool samples from th is study  alongside stools from 
vancom ycin-treated subjects showed that by  [CONTACT_771392], 
subjects treated with fidaxomicin had: (i) undiminished fecal titers of Bacteroides fragilis and 
other major ph ylogenetic groups; (ii) lo wer post -treatment C. difficile spore counts; (iii) less 
frequent post -therapy  expression of toxin.
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3 Studies
Two randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter phase 3 studies Studies 101.1.C.003 
and 101.1.C.004) were conducted to compare th e safet y and efficacy of 400 mg/day 
fidaxomicin (taken orally as 200 mg tablet q12h) with 500 mg/day  vancomycin capsule (taken 
orally  as 125 mg q6h) for 10 day s in subjects with CDAD. Comparing fidaxomicin to 
vancom ycin, clinical response rates at the EOT were similar ( Study  101.1.C.003 : 92.2% versu s 
89.6%; Study  101.1.C.004: 91.7% versu s 90.6%, fidaxomicin versu s vancomy cin, per protocol 
population). Fidaxomicin was superior to vancomy cin for sustained clinical response at 30 
days follow -up ( Study  101.1.C. 003: 74.4% versu s 64.2%, p=0.007; Study  101.1.C.004 : 76.7% 
versus 63.3%, p=0.001, Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) population). Recurrence rates were 
significantl y lower with fidaxomicin compared to vancom ycin ( Study 101.1.C.003 : 15.7% 
versus 25.1%, p=0.008; Study  101.1.C.004: 12.6% v ersus 27.0%, p<0.001, FAS population). 
In pooled results, fidaxomicin was well-tolerated with a safet y profile similar to that of 
vancom ycin. Only 5.9% of subjects treated with fidaxomicin withdrew from trials due to 
AEs. The primary  cause leading to discontinuation was vomiting, occurring at an incidence 
of 0.5% in both fidaxomicin and vancom ycin treatment groups.
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 2A Pediatric Study
A single arm phase 2A study  (OPT -80-206) in subjects with CDAD aged 6 months to 17 
years and 11 months to assess the safet y, tolerability  and pharmacokinetics of fidaxomicin 
tablets and suspension was conducted . Subjects below 6 y ears of age received weight -based 
doses of fidaxomicin oral suspension (32 mg/kg/day  with a maximum dose of 400 mg/day , 
divided into two doses) every  12 hours for 10 days. Subjects 6 y ears–17 years 11 months 
received 200 mg fidaxomicin tablets every  12 hours for 10 day s.
Clinical response rates were high overall, with 92.1% of subjects experiencing a clinical cure. 
Recurrence rates were 28.6% overall, and higher than observed in prior adult studies. T his is 
likely  reflective of high number of pediatric patients enrolling with prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_771358] , 
which is a strong risk factor for further recurrence [McFarland, 1999] . 
This study  was conducted in children with underly ing CDAD, and frequently  severe 
underly ing diseases such as neoplasms (24%). Overall, the safet y observations were consistent 
with both the underly ing conditions of the subjects and with data from prior studies in the adult 
CDAD population, and suggest that fidaxomicin is well tolerated in this population.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Fecal concentrations were in excess of the MIC 90of the organism in all age groups. There 
was a trend toward higher fecal concentrations of fidaxomicin in the lowest age group.
Higher fecal concentrations in the lowest age group or in individuals in other age groups are 
not related to AEs.
As observed previously in adults, plasma concentrations were generally  in the low ng/mL 
range, with a mean fidaxomicin concentration across the age strata that ranged from 9.8 
ng/mL to 15.2 ng/mL, at [ADDRESS_1058941] -dose. As in adults, metabolite concentrations in the 
plasma wer e typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y higher than parent concentrations, though still in the ng/mL range, 
with mean values from 28.5 ng/mL to 122 ng/mL across the age strata. There appeared to be 
no age -related trends in sy stemic exposures.
The observed plasma levels were not found to be above the levels observed in the main 
juvenile dog oral toxicity  study  (2819- TX-0004).
For further stud y results details reference is made to the I nvestigator’s Brochure addendum [ADDRESS_1058942]-marketing pharmacovigilance data. The full safet y 
information of fidaxomicin is described in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) version 9.3.

experience and clinical studies. For safet y information of vancomycin reference is made to 
the SmPC vancomy cin capsules.
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment
CDAD in adults is associated with significant mortality andmorbidity , particularly  in those 
infected with highly  virulent strains. Loo showed that deaths attributable to CDAD occurred 
in 6.9% of patients [Loo et al, 2005], while all cause mortality  in the fidaxomicin phase 3 
studies was 5.3% to 7.6% . In an observational study  the mortalit y in children with CDAD 
was3.8% [ Kim et al, 2008 ]. The risks of any treatment should therefore be assessed in the 
context of the seriousnes s of the underl ying condition. The currentl y recommended 
treatments ,metranidazole a nd vancomy cin,have limitations such as disruption of intestinal 
flora, cross resistance with other agents and a high rate of recurrence. Fidaxomicin has low 
systemic absorption and a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity  and therefore represents 
a pot entially  useful treatment forCDAD in children .

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Non-clinical safet y pharmacology, repeat dose toxicity , genotoxicity  and reproductive 
toxicity  studies of fidaxomicin did not identify  any hazard for humans.
Although s ystemic bioavailability  is low in humans (Cmax9.88 ng/mL after a 200 mg dose), 
the elderl y and those with CDAD appear to have higher exposure, as do patients with hepatic 
impairment.
Common AEs observed in the adult phase 3 studies were nausea, vomiting, and constipation. 
Uncommon AEs were rash, pruritis, decreased appetite, dizziness, headache, dysgeusia, 
abdominal distension, flatulence, dry  mouth and alanine aminotransferase increased (SmPC 
Dificlir). Acute h ypersensitivity  reactions have been reported during post marketing such as 
rash, pruritis, angioedema and d yspnea. [reference IB version 9.3 ]. 
In the phase [ADDRESS_1058945] treatments for CDAD, vancom ycin,was comparable in terms of clinical 
response and safet y and may  be associated with higher rates of recurrence compared with 
fidaxomicin treatment.
The results of the phase 2A pediatric stud y (age: > 6 months - <18 years: see section 1.2) 
showed a safet y profile consistent with that seen in adults, with gastrointestinal disorders and 
infections/infestations the commonest AEs.  Six subjects developed AEs considered related 
to study  drug none of which were serious. These were tachy cardia, constipation, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, increased body  temperature, urticaria, and elevated liver enzy mes. There 
were no safety signals detected b y analysis of vital signs, ECG or laboratory  data.  
Fidaxomicin has not been used in children < 6 months. A 4-week oral repeated- dose toxicity  
study  in juvenile beagle dogs showed no target organ for toxicity  after 28 day s of dosing up 
to 200 mg/kg/day  fidaxomicin fr om P ost Natal D ay 4(see section 1.2.1 ), which is the age 
equivalent to a newborn child.
Fidaxomicin is the first representative in the novel antib acterial class of macrocy cles. The 
current safet y data -base consists of a total of 798patients with mild to moderatel y severe 
CDI treated up to [ADDRESS_1058946] -marketing experience since July  2011, the safet y 
profile of fidaxomicin has slightly  changed relative to that seen in the Phase III studies. Some 
patients with hy persensitivity  reactions reported a history  of allergy  to macrolides. 
Fidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with a known macrolides allergy (SmPC 
Dificlir). The availab le data suggest that fidaxomicin will have an acceptable benefit-risk 
balance in the treatment of CDAD in children.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 22 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DESIGN, AND ENDPOINT S
2.1 Study Objectives
2.1.1 Primary
The primary  objective of this study  is to investigate the clinical response tofidaxomicin oral 
suspension or tablets and vancom ycin oral liquid or capsules of pediatric sub jects with 
Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) from birth 
to <18 yearsof age.
2.1.2 Secondary
The secondary  objectives of this study  are to investigate the recurrence/sustained clinical 
response to and safet y of fidaxomicin and vancomycin in pediatric sub jects with Clostridium 
difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) from birth to <18 yearsof age, as well as palatability  
(acceptance) of the fid axomicin oral suspension formulation. 
2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This is a multicenter , investigator -blind , randomized parallel group study  to investigate the 
safet yand efficacy of a 10 -day course of fidaxomicin oral suspension or table ts anda 10-day 
course of vancom ycin oral liquid or capsules in subjects from birth to < 18 yearsof age with 
confirmed CDAD. Note that in the [LOCATION_002] of America subjects can only  be included if 
aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years.
In order to reduce diff erential assessment of safet y and efficacy outcome s,typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  a double -
blind study  would be preferred. However, due to nature of the active treatment and the 
comparator (e.g. formulation differences, dosing regimen differences) , double blinding of the 
study  drug for this pediatric study  population is not feasible, given dosing constraints. 
Therefore the study  will be investigator -blinded only .
The study will be conducted in North America and Europe across ~ 65to 80sites. A target of 
onehundred forty four subjects, stratified b y age at enrollment ( from birth to < 24 months, 
≥ 2 y ears to < 6 years, ≥ 6 y ears to < 12 years, and ≥ 12 y ears to < 18 years) will be enrolled. 
A minimum of 24 subjects will be enrolled into each age group . 
Subjects will be randomized to either fidaxomicin or vancom ycin arm in a 2:[ADDRESS_1058948]/parent/legal guardian (or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110067] e.g. when hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]). These interviews will be conducted in the morning, dail y during

aliquots one for detection of toxigenic C.difficile at site and one for the reference lab (for 
possible microbiological and biochemistry  testing), for reassessment of CDAD (as per protocol 
criteria). Subjects with recurrence of CDAD will after the Unscheduled visit, continue in the 
Follow -up period and will only  be contact[CONTACT_771394] S for safet y (adverse events).
Thirty days after EOT, the EOS TC/ visit will take place. For subjects that had a confirmed 
clinical response at EOT +2 day s and did not experience a recurrence during the Follow-up 
period, all assessments will be done, including sustained clinical response assessment. For all 
other subjects a telephone call (TC) will be done for recording of safe ty information (adverse 
events).
Unscheduled visits could take place throughout the study  period, if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_1275]. Onl y those assessments that are relevant according to the investigators opi[INVESTIGATOR_771361]. However, evaluation of adverse events (AE) and concomitant

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 22.2.2 Dose Rationale
Subjects aged ≥ 6 years to < 18 years will be randomized to receive either 400 mg dail y dose 
of fidaxomicin or 500 mg dail y dose of vancom ycin and subjects from birth to <6yearsof 
agewill be randomized to receive weight based doses of either fidaxomicin oral suspension 
or vancom ycin oral liquid.
Vancom ycin will be given at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 500 mg/day, either 
as an oral liquid (Vancomy cin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771362], 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_771363], Italian SmPC) , or oral capsules. This dose of vancom ycin is considered 
standard for children ( SmPC v ancomy cin capsules) .Please refer to section 5.1.[ADDRESS_1058952] total dail y dose of vancom ycin in adults is 500 mg/day , while that for 
fidaxomicin is 20% lower at 400 mg/day . Neither drug unde rgoes appreciable sy stemic 
absorption when administered orally , both are considered effective and have an acceptable 
risk/benefit balance.
The total daily  dose of fidaxomicin for children in the current study  was therefore chosen to 
be 20% lower than the standard dose of vancomycin as follows:
Fidaxomicin will be given at a dose of 32 mg/kg/day  up to a maximum of 400 mg/day , either 
as an oral suspension, or oral tablets. Please refer to section 5.1.1 T able 3A weight based 
dosing instruction of the fidaxomicin oral suspension . 
Both treatments will be given for 10 day s, a duration demonstrated to result in an acceptable 
cure rate of 85.7% to 88.2% inthe adult phase 3 studies.
The results of the Phase 2A pediatric stud y (OPT -80-206) suggest a pharmacokinetic profile 
that is generall y similar to that observed in adults, with low ng/mL  concentrations of 
fidaxomicin and its metabolite observed in the plasma, while concentrations in the feces are 
in the μg/g range, well above the MIC90 of the target organism. Overall, the safet y 
observations were consistent with both the underlying conditions of the subjects and with 
data from prior studies in the adult CDAD population, and suggest that fidaxomicin is well 
tolerated in this population. The pharmacokinetic, safet y, and efficacy results observed in this 
study  support the continuation of pediatric development of fidaxomicin with the same dose.

4.3 Study Drug Handling 
Current ICH GCP Guidelines require the investigator to ensure that stud y drug deliveries 
from the Sponsor are received by  [CONTACT_093]/or designee and
that such deliveries are recorded,
that study  drug is handled and stored accordin g to labeled storage conditions,
that study  drug with appropriate expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061] /retest and is only dispensed to study  subjects in 
accordance with the protocol , and
that any  unused study  drug is returned to the Sponsor .
As this is an investigator blind study , site and Sponsor staff involved in dispensing , 
administering or collecting the study  drug will be unblinded . 
Drug inventory  and accountability  records for the study  drugs will be kept by  [CONTACT_1275]/ or designee. Study  drug accountability  throughout the study  must be documented 
and reconciled. The following guidelines are therefore pertinent:
The investigator agrees not to supply  study  drugs to any  persons except the eligible 
subjects in this study  in accordance with the protocol.
The investigator or designee will keep the stud y drugs in a pharmacy  or other locked and 
secure storage facility  under controlled storage conditions, accessible only  to those 
authorized by  [CONTACT_559842].
A study  drug inventory  will be maintained by  [CONTACT_1719]. The inventory  
will include details of material received and a clear record of when they  were dispensed 
and to which subject.
At the conclusion or termination of this study , the investigator or designee agrees to 
conduct a final drug supply  inventory  and to record the results of this inventory  on the 
Drug Accountabil ity Record. I t must be possible to reconcile delivery  records with those 
of used and/or returned medication. An y discrepancies must be accounted for and 
documented. Appropriate forms of deliveries and returns must be signed b y the site staff 
delegated this responsibility .
The site must return study drug to the Sponsor or designee at the end of the study  or 
upon expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].

treatment with unblinded staff, subjects and parents/legal guardians.
Given the complexity  of maintaining the blind because of the charactaristics of the study  
medication and the pediatric population, accidental unblinding is a risk. Every  effort will be 
taken to maintain the blind. In the event of accidental unblinding of blinded site, CRO or 
sponsor staff, this will be documented. Accidental unblinding is not a reason to discontinue 
study  drug, even if the unblinding occurs b efore the start of treatment. Subjects should not be 
re-randomized for any  reason, even if accidental unblinding occurs. Further details will be 
described in the blinding instructions.

Subjects and parents/legal guardians/unblinded study  staff will be instructed not to discuss 
the treatment (appearance, frequency  of dosing, palatability , times of individual doses etc.) 
with the blinded study  staff.
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s)
Increases and reductions of study  drug are not permitted because the aim of the study  is to 
investigate fixed weight based dose of fidaxomicin and vancom ycin.  
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Non -Medication 
Therapy)
Previous medication (medication history ) taken within a month prior to screening will be 
entered in the Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  An y treatments of relevance to CDAD, 
either as t reatments for CDAD or causative agents such as antibiotics or anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_771367] [ADDRESS_1058977] recent 
use of fidaxomicin or any  macrolide antibiotic should be recorded in the eCRF, rega rdless of

Concomitant medication includes relevant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_373445] b y the study doctor, other 
doctors and over the counter drugs taken from Day 1 until the EOS ( EOT + 30 day s)and 
should be recorded in the eCRF .
Medication history  and concomitant treatment consists of drug and non- drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
prescribed and over -the-counter (OTC) and all alternative medicines. This also includes 
drugs used on a chronic and as- needed basis. Subjects will be instructed not to start any  new
medication during the screening period through EOS , both prescribed and OTC , without prior 
consultation of the investigator wherever possible.
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Medication and Restricted Medication
No other antibacterial agents potentially  useful in the treatment of CDAD (e.g., 
metronidazole , oral vancomy cin,oral bacitracin, fusidic acid, rifaximin, nitazoxanide) or 
fecal transplantation should be given during the study unless they  are specifically  given 
because of a primary  treatment failure or suspected CDAD recurrence after initial clinical 
response. 
It is preferred that prior to randomization, no pretreatment for CDAD is given . However, if 
the investigator feels there is a clinical imperative to begin treatment before knowi ng the 
laboratory  result of direct or indirect testing for presence of toxigenic C.difficile , up to four 
doses but no more than 24 hours of treatment with metronidazole , oral vancomycin or any  
other effective treatment for CDAD are allowed.

5.1.4 Treatment Compliance
Study  subjects and/or legal guardian (as applicable) should be counseled on the need to meet 
100% treatment compliance. The unblinded i nvestigator or designee should ensure that 
subjects meet this goal. The quantity  of study  drug dispense d will be counted or measured 
and recorded in the eCRF at EOT . 
Treatment compliance will be based on the weight of the oral liquid/oral suspension used or 
count of tablets/capsules used during the treatment period (whatever applies), which will be 
recorded in the eCRF. Subjects will be regarded as compliant if the calculated amount of 
oral liquid/oral suspension used or of tablets/capsules used (as applicable) is between 80%
and 120%

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 25.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AEcan therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality meets one of the 
following criteria:
Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms.
Requires active intervention.
Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  drug.
The abnormalit yor investigational value is clinically  significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_576812].
All subjects will remain in the study  until EOS for safet y assessment. All AEs occurring 
between signing informed consent and EOS TC/visit should be recorded.
The s pecified AEs / findings of interest for this study are shown below and may require m ore 
extensive collection of information which will be collected in targeted questionnaires: 
Development of microbial resistance to fidaxomicin
Hypersensitivity  to fidaxomicin
GIhemorrhage
Decreases in WBC, neutrophil and ly mphocy te counts 
Hepatic laboratory  value abnormalities
Renal laboratory value abnormalities
QT-interval prolongation 
Lack of efficacy  / lack of effect / treatment failure
Some countries may  have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE. I n these cases, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility  to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriatel y recorded in the (e)CRF accordingly.
In addition, if a nyof these events meet the criteria for a S erious Adverse E vent (SAE) , the 
SAE reporting requirements in section 5.5.5 will apply .
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Eve nts (SAEs)
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any  of the following outcomes:
Results in death
Is life threatening (an adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of

might have caused death)
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions
Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/ examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious) 
Other medicall y important events
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28954]. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or developme nt of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Special situation events relevant to the medicinal products administered to the subject as part 
of the study  (e.g., study  drug, comparator, background therapy ) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluat ion include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)
Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])
Drug -drug interaction
Lack of efficacy
All special situations listed above should be especially  monitored and reported on a SAE 
form, even if considered non -serious and regardless whether or not an (S)AE occurred. The 
above special situation will not be captured on the AE form in the eCRF, inst ead they  will be 
captured in the dosing and accountabilit y forms within the eCRF. 
As fidaxomicin is orally  administered, for this study , there is no risk of occupational 
exposure and risk of transmission of infectious agents is limited, therefore the Spon sor do not 
expect these events to be reported.
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an adverse 
event is reported that is considered to be an event per thisclassification as “always serious”, 
additional inform ation on the event may  be requested.   
If a subject becomes pregnant during treatment, this should be reported as if it were an SAE.

5.7.1 Stool Samples for Toxigenic C.difficile and Microbiological Testing
Stool samples will be obtained at Screening, at the End of Treatment visit and in case of 
recurre nce at the Unscheduled visit. Stool samples will be split into two aliquots; one for 
local (direct or indirect) testing for presence of toxigenic C.difficile at the study  site and one 
for microbiological testing at the reference laboratory. 
For assessment of inclusion criteria for Screening, a routinely  performed local rapid test that 
was taken after the onset of CDAD and within [ADDRESS_1059009] of care.
In this situati on an
addition alstool sample (for possible microbiological and biochemistry  testing) for the
reference laboratory  need sto be taken as part of Screening, even if on antibiotic treatment. 
Microbiological testing will be performed on stool samples collected pre -treatment and post -
treatment and in case of recurrence. Results from relevant microbiological and biochemical 
assay s may  be used foran exploratory  evaluation of efficacy  or to furthe r increase knowledge 
on the investigational product.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 25.8 Total Amount of Blood
The following blood volume limits for sampling are recommended (although are not evidence -
based). If an investigator decides to deviate from thes e, this should be justified. Per individual, 
the trial -related blood loss (including an y losses in the manoeuvre) should not exceed 3% of 
the total blood volume during a period of four weeks and should not exceed 1% at any  single 
time. I n the rare case of simultaneous trials, the recommendation of 3% remains the maximum. 
The total volume of blood is estimated at 80 to 90 mL /kg body  weight; 3% is 2.4 m Lblood per 
kg bod y weight. (Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products Conducted 
with the Paediatric Po pulation, European Medicines Agency , 2008 ).

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2The following imputation of missing information for the assessment of clinical response and 
recurrence /sustained response is foreseen (taking into consideration applicable visit 
windows) :
Missing information for efficacy  variables of confirmed clinical response and sustained 
clinical response will be estimated using the multiply imputation procedure which will
replace each missing value with a set of plau sible values as predictions from logistic 
regression based on bowel mo vement data, and previous CDAD experience . Each
multiply  imputed data set will then be anal yzed and the methodology  combines the 
results from all datasets to give a single final analysis that takes into account the 
uncertaint y of the imputed values .
Sensi tivity  analy ses forefficacy  endpoints  will be described in the SAP . 
As a general principle, no imputation of other missing data will be done (e.g. labs, vital signs, 
ECGs, etc) . Exceptions are the start and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medication. The 
imputed dates will be used to allocate the concomitant medication and AEs to a study  period , 
in order to determining whether an AE is/is not treatment emergent. Listings of the AEs and 
concomitant medications will present the actual partial dates; impu ted dates will not be shown.
Visit windows for the assessments planned a fter the EOT are defined in the Schedule of 
Assessments.
8 OPERATIONAL AND ADMI NISTRATIVE CONSIDERA TIONS
8.1 Procedure for Clinical Study Quality Control
8.1.1 Data Collection
The investigator or designee will enter data collected using an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) s ystem. All data on each subject generated according to the protocol must be recorded 
continuously  in an eCRF designed according to the protocol .The investigator or site 
designee is responsible to ensure that all data in the eCRFs and queries are accurate and 
complete and that all entries are verifiable with source documents. These documents should 
be appropriatel y maintained by [CONTACT_779].
For dat a that can potentially  unblind staff (e.g., drug dispensing, drug intake, drug returned, 
palatability , drug concentration blood samples )a separate database will be set up, only  
accessible for unblinded site staff and the unblinded monitor.
The monitor sh ould verify  the data in the eCRFs with source documents and confirm that 
there are no inconsistencies between them.
Laboratory  tests are performed at local laboratory . The data will be entered in the eCRF.
The ECGs are done locally  at site and all origina l ECG traces are to be shipped to central 
ECG reader for central ECG reading. Central ECG read data will be transferred electronicall y 
to the Sponsor.

Testing should be repeated within [ADDRESS_1059064]:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3× ULN Or > 2× ULN
Severe* > 3× ULN and > 2× ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8× ULN
●ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks  
●ALT or AST > 3× ULN and INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3× ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophi lia (> 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  asmoderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , phy sical 
examination and laboratory  tests. The site should complete the L iver Abnormality  Case Report 
Form (LA -CRF) that has been developed globall y and can be activated for any  study  or an 
appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should be 
followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2- [ADDRESS_1059065] i s 
asymptomatic.  
Severe hepat ic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another etiology , 
may beconsidered an important medical event and may be reported as a Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE).  The S ponsor should be contact[CONTACT_771410].

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘adverse events’ on the AE page of the
(e)CRF. Illnesses and conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac 
disease t hatmay lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Non- alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients 
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels.   The investigator should 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreatio nal drug use, and 
special diets.  Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medicat ion page of the (e)CRF .  Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document .
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents .
●Based on the subject ’s history ,  other testing may  be appropriate including: 
○acute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) 
○ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract dise ase
○other laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT ’s, such as viral hepatitis, pre-existing or 
acute liver disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subject may  be 
discontinued from the study. The investigator may determine that it is not in the subject’s best 
interest to continue study enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is

●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic l aboratory  tests is 
not possible, drug should be discontinued.

1.Update Inclusion Criteria
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Inclusion Criteria #2 has been amended to specify  that in the [LOCATION_002] of America 
subjects can onl y be included if aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years .
RATIONALE:
Following the submission of Substantial Amendment 1 protocol version 2.0, dated 21 
November 2014, related to the widening of the inclusion criteria to open the study  for 
inclusion of children from birth onwards, the FDA raised concerns regarding the inclus ion of 
children younger than 6 months. The FDA is concerned that the extension of enrollment to 
children younger than 6 months of age will result in inclusion of subjects who are colonized 
rather than infected with C. difficile . 
Because the FDA has granted a waiver for the development of fidaxomicin for children from 
birth to 6 months due to the concern around diagnosis in this age group, subjects from birth 
to less than 6 months cannot be included in the 2819- CL-0202 US study  sites.

7.10 Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows, and Other Information
The following imputation of completel y missing information for the assessment of clinical 
response and recurrence is foreseen (taking into consideration applicable visit windows):
Missing information for confirmed clinical response will be classified as clinical failure 
(no response). 
Missing information for sustained clinical response 16 day s after the EOT (at Day  26) 
will be classified as recurrence (= no sustained clinical response), unless data after Day  
26 is available that suggests/confirms that clinical response was sustained until Day  26.
Missing information for sustained clinical response 30 day s after the EOT (at Day  40) 
will be classified as recurrence (= no sustained clinical response). 
Handling of other missing data related to efficacy  endpoints will be detailed in the SAP, if 
deemed appropriate. Sensitivity  analy ses of efficacy  results (with and without imputation) 
might be necessary  and will be described in the SAP. 
As a general princ iple, no imputation of other missing data will be done.

7.9 Interim Anal ysis (and Early  Discontinuation of the Clinical Study )
No formal interim anal ysis is planned. If required for regulatory submissions, interim 
analyses may be carried out (e.g. to present the results of some age strata while 
recruitment is ongoing in other strata).  Is so, details of the analysis and for preserving 
the blind will be included in the analysis plan.
7.10 Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows, and Other Information
Every effort should be made to follow -up subjects and to obtain data – especially on the 
important endpoints of confirmed clinical response (EOT+2) and recurrence / sustained 
clinical response (to EOS).

Missing information for efficacy variables of confirmed clinical response and sustai ned 
clinical response will be estimated using the multiply imputation procedure which 
will replace each missing value with a set of plausible values as predictions from 
logistic regression based on bowel movement data, and previous CDAD experience.  
Each m ultiply imputed data set will then be analyzed and the methodology 
combines the results from all datasets to give a single final analysis that takes into 
account the uncertainty of the imputed values. classified as clinical failure (no 
response).
Missing i nformation for sustained clinical response 16 day s after the EOT (at Day  26)

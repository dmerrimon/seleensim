Protocol Body  
 
1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Primary  Objectives:  
 
1.1.1  To characterize the safety of anti -CD22 immunoconjugate inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (CMC -544), when administered in conjunction with fludarabine, 
bendamustine, and rituximab as non -myeloablative preparative regimen for 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation for CD22 -positive lymphoid  malignancies.  
 
1.2 Seco ndary  Objectives:  
1.2.1  To estimate tumor  response.  
1.2.2  To determine overall and event -free survival rates by [CONTACT_662207].  
2.0 Background  
2.1 Non-myeloablative Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Lymphoid 
Malignancies . 
 
In conventional transplants, high-dose chemotherapy plus radiation, is 
used to destroy as many lymphoma cells as possible. However, these high dose 
associated with conventional stem cell transplantation. This has restricted the 
use of conventional transplantation to younger patients w ho may be more able to 
undergo this treatment.  
In a European Bone Marrow Transplantation Group study in which the 
majority of patients received total body irradiation -based preparative  
(pre-transplant) regimens, the treatment -related mortality for the allo geneic group 
was 25% compared  with 11% for the autologous  group.1   Another  multicenter 
analysis of allogeneic transplantation in 113 patients with advanced low -grade 
lymphoma  reported  a treatment -related  mortality  of 40%.2    A similar  high mortality 
has been seen using the chemotherapy conditioning regimen of 
cyclophosphamide,  carmustine  and etoposide.3
 
Non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NST) was 
developed following the observation that leukemia/lymphoma patients, who ha d 
received allogeneic transplantation and then subsequently relapsed, went back 
into remission  following  infusions  of donor  lymphocytes.[ADDRESS_893402] proved resistant to high -dose 
chemotherapy and irradi ation, then these highly toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_662200].  
 
Evidence for a graft -versus -lymphoma (GVL) effect includes the 
observation that patients who develop chronic graft -versus -host-disease 
(cGVHD) following allogeneic transplantation, where the donor’s immune cells

MDACC ID: 2012-[ADDRESS_893403] ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
2012 -0295                 Version 28, 0 9 November 2022  Page 4  1 
6 attack the patient’s normal tissue, have a lower probability of relapsing than 
patients who do not develop cGVHD. Chopra, et. al. demonstrated a lower 
incidence of relap se in patients who acquired cGVHD (0% relapse with cGVH D  
versus 35% relapse with no cGVHD). Perhaps the most direct data supporting 
the evidence and clinical significance of GVL comes from small studies and case 
reports whereby [CONTACT_662208], which is often accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in 
the size of their lymphomas. Van -Besien demonstrated that of 9 patients  who 
relapsed after allogeneic transplantation, 4 (44%) responded to withdrawal of 
immunosuppression drugs (2 complete remissions, 2 partial remissions), with  
responses that lasted nearly [ADDRESS_893404] is to establish immunological tolerance  between the 
patient’s immune system and the new stem cells from the donor, and to use this 
as a platform for immunotherapy involving the activation of immune cells, with  
donor lymphocytes as the active agent. In NST, the patient receives low doses 
of chemotherapy and radiation, as well as drugs to suppress the immune  system 
in order to prevent rejection of the donor stem cells. The donor stem cells are 
then infused into the patient. The patient’s suppressed immune system allows 
the donor cells to travel to the bone marrow where they produce replacement 
blood cells. This process is known as engraftment. Once engraftment occurs, 
the patient’s new blood and immune systems, resulting from the donor cells, 
have the ability to recognize and eradicate bot h the patient’s remaining stem 
cells and the lymphoma  cells.  
Therefore, although NST was initially designed to decrease transplant 
related morbidity so that elderly patients, patients with other serious conditions, 
and patients relapsing from prior autolog ous transplants could be more safely 
treated, it is now seen as an effective form of immunotherapy for possibly all 
lymphomas.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_893405] (a)  produce suppression of the 
patient's immune system to prevent rejection of the donor cells and (b) suppress 
the lymphoma sufficiently to prevent marked progression of the tumor and allow 
time for the GVL effect to occur.  
 
2.2.1  FCR regimen.  
 
Our initial studies  at MD Anderson involved a combination of fludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) as a conditioning regimen for patients 
who had chemosensitive disease (Protocol ID99 -035) and who were to receive a 
transplant  from a compatible  sibling  donor.7 A recent  update  reported  an overall 
survival (OS) rate of 85% and progression -free survival (PFS) rates of 83% in 
patients with follicular lymphoma patients. Median follow -up time was [ADDRESS_893406] with FCR has been a successful strategy for patients wit h indolent 
lymphomas who had a chemosensitive relapse, results in patients who 
aggressive histologies or had refractory disease or were in kinetic failure at the 
time of transplantation need to be improved upon. The 5 -year OS and PFS rates 5

MDACC ID: 2012-[ADDRESS_893407] ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
2012 -0295                 Version 28, 0 9 November 2022  Page 5  9 in mantle cell l ymphoma were 53% and 46%, respectively. 8 Results were poorer  
in diffuse large cell lymphoma. Intensification of the preparative regimen has 
been associated with increased toxicity with no improvement in outcomes.  
Immunomanipulation with donor lymphocytes or rapid immune suppression 
withdrawal has been associated with an increased risk of GVHD without 
documented improvement in survivals.  
 
2.2.2  Bendamustine -based regimen  (FBR).  
 
Bendamustine is an alkylating agent with a unique structure containing 
both a nitrogen mustard group and a benzimidazole ring. It has been shown to be 
active against cell lines that are resistant to other alkylating agents in pre -clinical 
experiments in vitro. Its activity profile, when compared with othe r commercially 
available chemotherapeutics in the NCI human [ADDRESS_893408] to further elucidate the possible existence of a 
unique mechanism of action, including potential contribution of the purine -like 
structure of the agent. There were 13 published reports of combination therapy 
with bendamustine for the treatment of low -grade NHL. In the publications that 
included only patients with NHL, overall response rates ranged from 66% to 96%, 
CR rates ranged from 20% to 60%, and PR rates ranged from 30% to 53%.There 
were 8 published reports of combination therapy with bendamustine for the 
treatment of high -grade NHL (N=72); overall response rates in these studies  
were 50%.  
Patients with lymphoid malignancies who are consi dered for allogeneic 
transplantation usually have had multiple relapses and have been thus rendered 
resistant to cyclophosphamide, the backbone of most conventional treatment 
regimens for NHL. In vitro studies suggest that there is no cross -resistance 
betw een cyclophosphamide and bendamustine, and that the latter may 
overcome the resistance to cyclophosphamide with lesser toxicities. Some other 
studies have also suggested recently a synergy between bendamustine and 
purine analogs.  
We have recently initiated  a phase I/II trial of NST with bendamustine 
(maximum dose of 130 mg/m2/day x3) together with fludarabine and rituximab 
for patients with relapsed lymphoid malignancies (Protocol 2008 -0246).  
Twenty -four patients have been treated. No DLT was observed. 
Myel osuppression was minimal (80% of patients did not require platelet 
transfusions,  and 61% did not have  a neutrophil  nadir  of below  500) and only one 
death occurred (ASH 2011, abstract # 894, oral presentation) This regimen is 
now replacing the FCR as a back bone for our NST regimens, and can be used 
as a platform for combination with additional agents to increase efficacy 
especially in patients with aggressive histologies and/or refractory  disease.  
 
2.3 Anti-CD22 Immunoconjugate Inotuzumab Ozogamicin  (CMC -544). 
 
CMC -544 is a humanized antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, a 
cytotoxic agent. CMC -544 targets CD22, which is expressed in the majority of 
B-cell NHL and in more than 80% of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).  
CMC -544 alone and in combination with rituximab  has demonstrated efficacy and 
tolerability in indolent and aggressive NHL patients including diffuse large B -cell 
lymphoma12,13   , and more  recently  a 57% response  rate was seen  in relapsed  10,11

2.4 Proposed  Study . 
 
Because of the above properties, CMC -544 would be an ideal candidate 
for dose -escalation, as part of a non -myeloablative nontoxic conditioning (such 
as FBR) and allogeneic NST. We propose to treat cohorts of patients in an 
escalating dose of 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg/m2. CMC -544 would be given on D -13 in 
order to decrease the risk of veno -occlusive disease or unforeseen additive 
toxicity to the conditioning. We propose the FBR as conditio ning due to its well 
known favorable safety profile. We hope that this unique strategy will further 
decrease the relapse rate, especially in patients with aggressive histologies.

7.0 Statistical  Considerations  
Statistical section - patient sample size and analysis plan:  
 
7.1 The study  design  developed  by [CONTACT_42336], Li, and Bekele  (2007)  will be used  to determine  the 
MTD of CMC -544 targeting a toxicity rate not greater than 30% using a prior 
beta(0.5, 0.5). Three doses of CMC -544 will be studied (0.6, 1.2, 1.8 mg/m2). The 
dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as gr ade III or IV renal, hepatic, intestinal, 
neurologic, pulmonary or cardiac adverse events, as well as any graft failure or 
treatment -related death at any time from first CMC -544 administration (D -13) through 
[ADDRESS_893430] transplant  (D30).  
 
Patients will be  enrolled in cohorts of two, beginning at 0.6 mg/m2. Each cohort of two 
must be fully evaluated for toxicity through D30 before enrolling the next cohort. The trial 
monitoring chart is displayed in Table 1. This table describes when a dose is declared 
too toxic and should be de -escalated or is safe and can be escalated or chosen as the 
MTD. The MTD is defined as the highest dose for which the probability of toxicity is 
closest to 30%. A legend is displayed below the table. Prior to advancing dose levels a 
cohort summary must be completed and submitted to the Clinical Research Medical 
Monitor (IND Office).

If the current dose is 1.8 mg/m and the decision rule from Table 1 is E (escalate), then 
future patients will be treated at 1.8 mg/m . We will terminate the trial when the maximum 
sample size (n=30) is reached.  
 
Table [ADDRESS_893432] two scenarios contain safe toxicity rates for all doses (<30%) and the

MDACC ID: 2012-[ADDRESS_893433] ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
[ADDRESS_893434] scenario contains unsafe toxicity rates for all doses (>30%).  
 
 
Secondary Outcomes  
 
We will estimate the objective overall re sponse (CR+PR) with a 95% confidence interval 
in the dose that is declared the MTD. We will use logistic regression to assess the 
association between response and disease and clinical characteristics of interest.  
 
Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be used to estimate overall survival and  
recurrence -free survival. We will use Cox proportional hazards regression methodology 
to assess the association between disease and clinical characteristics and the survival 
outcomes. We will use the meth od of Gooley et al to estimate the cumulative incidence  
of acute and chronic GVHD.

Causality  Assessment . 
For the purpose of this study common adverse events of Fl udarabine, 
Bendamustine and Rituximab as preparative regimen for allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation are known and well described. Therefore an increased pattern 
of frequency and or severity of these events will be assessed and reported as 
definitive rela ted to the preparative regimen in combination of CMC -544. 
 
When the relationship of the adverse event cannot be ruled out with certainty 
the AE may be considered probable or possible related . 
 
Adverse events known to be related to drugs used for supportive  treatment will 
be scored as unrelated .

List of most common expected AEs related to high dose chemotherapy followed by 
[CONTACT_662213]:  
1. Infections  in the presence  or absence  of neutropenia:  fungal,  bacterial  and 
or viral  infections.  
2. Fever : Non -neutropenic or neutropenic without  infection  
3. Acute graft versus host disease  (aGVHD): most commonly manifested by 
[CONTACT_362656], diarrhea and abnormal liver function tests could also present with 
some  degree  of fever,  upper  gastrointestinal  symptoms  (nausea  and vomiting) 
mucositis and eye  dryness.  
4. Gastrointestinal (GI tract) : the GI t ract manifestations could be not only due 
to direct damage from the preparative regiment but also be a manifestation of 
GVHD or infections. Therefore, the time, course, and its presentation are 
crucial when assessing these as adverse events. Nausea/vomitin g, mucositis, 
and diarrhea  when  presented  within  first [ADDRESS_893441]  likely  will be related 
to the preparative  regimen.  
5. Skin rash : not related to GVHD could be caused by [CONTACT_662214].  
6. Transaminitis:  liver function test  elevation.  
7. Pulmonary  events:  not related  to CHF most  likely  caused  by [CONTACT_662215]. These could present with a pneumonitis pattern manifested with 
shortness of breath, pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, sometimes 
accompanied by [CONTACT_662216][INVESTIGATOR_662205] a diffuse bilateral alveolar  pattern.  
8. Cytokine Storm/ engraftment syndrome : most likely caused by  [CONTACT_662217].  
9. Hemorrhagic cystitis : not r elated to chemotherapy agents used in  the 
proposed  preparative  regimen  is most  likely  caused  by [CONTACT_300618].

adverse events and would not be recorded in the  database:  
1. Flu-like symptoms not associated with  infection  
3. Abnormal laboratory findings considered associated to the  original 
disease  
4. Isolated changes in laboratory parameters such as  electrolyte,

onset and resolution date a nd maximum grade. Intermittent events should be 
labeled as such and followed until resolution. If a patient is taken off study while 
an event  still ongoing,  this will be followed  until resolution  unless  another  therapy 
is initiated. Pre -existing medical co nditions will be recorded only if an 
exacerbation occurs during the active treatment period. Medical events not 
considered adverse events will not be collected. Co -morbid events will not be 
scored  separately.  
 
Adverse events will be documented based on pro gress notes, including the 
flowsheet, in the electronic (Clinic Station) patient medical record.

Serious Adverse Events Reporting (SAE)  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience  as it occurred.  It does  not include  an adverse  experience  that, had it occurred  in 
a more severe form, might have caused  death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal 
life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result i n death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to preve nt one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR  312.32).  
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse 
events.  Any important  medical  event  can and should  be reported  as an SAE if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND  Office.  
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in 
“The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy 
for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. 
Unless  stated  otherwise  in the protocol,  all SAEs,  expected  or unexpected,  must  be reported 
to the IND Office,  regardless  of attribution  (within  5 working  days  of knowledge  of the event).  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, 
must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of  the 
event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND  Office.  
 
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application ( eSAE) will be utilized  for 
safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC  IRB. 
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_893445] returned to baseline, progression of the event  has

• Additionally,  any serious  adverse  events  that occur  after  the [ADDRESS_893447] be reported to the IND Office. This may 
include the development of a secondary  malignancy.  
 
Reporting to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety  Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR  312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_662206], Good Clinical Practices, the

Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 4 of 48Version Date: May 8,[ZIP_CODE].1. Objectives: Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives.
This proposal is for a Phase III study to examine the beneficial, pro-autophagy effects of 
Metformin in adults with prediabetes.  
Our long term goal is to develop a phase III study in response to a specific NIH FOA using high 
content screening of leucocyte LC3 puncta scores, qRT-PCR transcription factor EB (TFEB) 
scores, and assays of total DNA methylation and galectin-3, to gauge the magnitude of 
metformin’s effects on autophagy and cell senescence as markers of aging in adults with 
prediabetes. This study will provide preliminary data for such a proposal and will also fill a 
knowledge gap regarding the use of validated biomarkers in this field.  It will also contribute 
significantly to the overall anti-aging literature. The primary objective of this proposal is to 
validate the autophagy experimental design in humans by [CONTACT_542463]3, TFEB, Galectin-
3, and total methylation of DNA scores as markers of autophagy activity and cell senescence.
1.2. State the hypotheses to be tested.
AIM 1: Demonstrate that metformin therapy will increase cellular autophagy as an 
inverse correlate of aging as measured by [CONTACT_542464]3 and TFEB scores. 
Hypothesis 1: In addition to beneficial effects on glycemia, body weight, and body 
composition, metformin therapy exerts beneficial effects on surrogate measures of 
autophagy and aging.
Primary outcome: Increased levels of LC3 in leukocytes.
AIM 2: Demonstrate that metformin therapy will mitigate evidence of aging as 
measured by [CONTACT_542465] 3 among 
adults with prediabetes. 
Hypothesis 2: Metformin therapy exerts beneficial effects on DNA methylation as measures 
of aging
Primary outcome: Increased DNA methylation in leukocytes.
AIM 3: Monitor the beneficial metabolic effects of metformin in adults with 
prediabetes. Hypothesis 3: Metformin therapy will elicit the expected beneficial effects on 
glycemia, body weight, insulin resistance, and body composition demonstrated in previous 
studies.
Primary outcome: Decreased A1c. 
2. Background
2.1. Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge.
Anti-aging medicine is a burgeoning field, and accumulating data implicates the cellular 
process of autophagy as the primary mechanism of normal aging and the diseases 
associated with aging. Autophagy is considered to be a process of “cellular recycling” and is 
known to affect a spectrum of health and disease states associated with aging, including 
inflammatory disorders, metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
cancer and neurodegeneration. The dynamics of autophagy are strictly controlled by 
[CONTACT_273735]-related genes as well as by [CONTACT_542466], 
the target of metformin. Autophagy also affects stem cells and cellular senescence. When 
the process of autophagy fails, the result is a state of chronic inflammation and degenerative 
diseases in many systems.

Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 5 of 48Version Date: May 8,[ZIP_CODE].2. Describe any relevant preliminary data.
Diabetes can be considered a disease of premature aging, and many of the salutary effects 
of metformin therapy in diabetes can be interpreted as slowing or reversing the aging 
process. For example, in Western societies, 44% of patients with type 2 diabetes die within 
10 years of diagnosis [1], and the incidence of, and mortality from, cardiovascular disease 
are 2–3 times greater in patients with diabetes than in the general population [2]. In current 
practice, metformin is the consensus first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes not only for its 
potent anti-hyperglycemic effects, but also for its well-documented improvements in 
endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and 
fat redistribution [3]. Metformin may also decrease adverse cardiovascular outcomes 
independent from its glucose-lowering activity, and it likely has anti-proliferative effects in 
cancer and may also exert a neuroprotective effect [4]. These apparent pleiotropic effects of 
metformin make it a prime candidate for investigation as an anti-aging therapy.
What is Autophagy? Autophagy is a key feature of aging cells and a ubiquitous process of 
cellular senescence in human tissues. It can be described as an irreversible arrest in cellular 
proliferation. Autophagy is a key cellular homeostatic [5,6] and metabolic process [7-12] that 
is the center of a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_542453] [13-28]. Autophagy responds to growth factors and is also exquisitely 
sensitive to cellular energy and nutritional status (e.g.- amino acids, glucose, ATP, NAD+, 
Acetyl-CoA, and neutral lipid stores) through very specific regulatory systems [29-38]. 
Autophagy affects a spectrum of human health and disease states [13, 17, 21-28], including 
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders [19,21,39,40], metabolic conditions such as obesity 
and diabetes [11,12,41-43], cardiovascular problems [17,25] cancer [13,15,20,28,44,45] 
neurodegeneration [18,22,40,46], infectious processes [21], and age-related diseases [47-
49]. 
Autophagy and Metabolism: Autophagy enables regulation of glucose metabolism, and its 
failure contributes to the Metabolic Syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes [12,41,42,60-
63]. Drugs such as metformin may affect autophagy [64]. Additionally, autophagy has 
connections with adipogenesis and lipolysis [11], and the cardinal regulators of metabolism 
in mammalian cells are also key upstream regulators of autophagy [9-11].
Autophagy and Inflammation: Autophagy directly and indirectly governs (often suppressing) 
activation of major inflammatory pathways associated with the pathogenesis of many 
diseases [17,19,39,50-54, 66]. It also modulates other global inflammatory processes, such 
as interferon responses [39]. These responses are key to maintaining normal immune 
homeostasis: failure of autophagy can lead to chronic inflammatory conditions (i.e.- Crohn’s 
Disease [57,66-70], cancer [23,28], infections (tuberculosis [21,58, 59, 71,72] or HIV and 
other viruses [73-76]), and autoimmunity [56,77-82]. 
Synergy Between Autophagy, Inflammation, and Metabolism: Autophagy and metabolic 
abnormalities such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and inflammation are interrelated 
[83-86]. For example, cholesterol crystals [87], fatty acids [88, 89], obesity-linked lipotoxicity 
of ceramide [89], and amylin [91] are known inflammasome agonists and inducers of 
inflammation.  Autophagy suppresses inflammasome activation [17,19,21,39, 50-55]. 
Autophagy also modulates lipid metabolism [9-11].

Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 6 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018All of this is relevant for aging. Rapamycin’s effects on aging have been observed for years 
[92-117], and Metformin’s impact on aging implicates similar mechanisms, but with improved 
metabolic sequelae [93,118].
2.3. Provide the scientific or scholarly background for, rationale for, and significance of the 
research based on the existing literature and how will it add to existing knowledge.
Numerous studies have documented the benefits conferred by [CONTACT_542467]-lowering agent 
Metformin. In animal models, Metformin is shown to increase both lifespan and healthspan, 
and a clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is currently ongoing to determine whether this effect 
translates to humans, as well as how the medication alters the adult human transcriptome. 
In vitro studies demonstrate Metformin’s ability to mitigate aging- and disease-related 
inflammation, oxidative damage, and diminished autophagy. Additionally, there are 
numerous cohort, case-control and meta-analysis studies confirming metformin’s reduction 
in cancer-related death via hypothesized activity in the relevant mTOR, HER2, miRNA and 
TGF-alpha pathways. As such, NIH has issued FOA PA-17-073 
(https:// grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-17-073.html) to solicit additional clinical 
studies that will evaluate Metformin’s effects on aging and age-related conditions. 
3. Study Design
3.1. Describe the study design 
(e.g., observational; 
randomized placebo-
controlled clinical trial, etc.)
We will perform a randomized, 
quasi-double blind, placebo-
controlled trial of metformin in 
adult patients with prediabetes.  
Inclusion criteria will comprise 
individuals aged 30-70 years 
(inclusive) with prediabetes 
(defined as an A1c of 5.7-6.4%) 
and a BMI between 27 and 40 
kg/m2 (inclusive).  Exclusion 
criteria will include prior 
treatment with metformin or 
other diabetes medications, 
pregnancy, the presence of 
significant renal dysfunction 
(Serum Creatinine > 1.3 mg/dl 
for women, > 1.4 mg/dl for 
men), severe hepatic 
dysfunction (AST or ALT > 3 
times the upper limit of normal), 
ongoing alcohol or substance 
abuse, inflammatory bowel 
disease, ongoing glucocorticoid 
therapy, or inability to render 
informed consent.Figure 1: Anti-Aging, Pro-Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes 
Study Description: A phase III study to examine the beneficial pro-autophagy effects of metformin in 
adults with prediabetes.  We hypothesize that in addition to beneficial effects on glycemia, body weight, 
and body composition, metformin therapy exerts beneficial effects on surrogate measures of inflammation

Page 7 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018As summarized in the accompanying Figure 1, all subjects will complete four study–related 
visits. All visits will occur within a 7-day window of the target date. At Visit 1, informed 
consent will be obtained, a brief medical history and physical examination will be performed, 
and a health-history questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_2299]. Blood samples will 
also be obtained for eligibility criteria at this visit.  Women of child-bearing age will receive a 
urine pregnancy test at Visit 1. 
At Visit 2, randomization to placebo or active Metformin will occur.  All subjects will receive 
standardized instruction about diet and exercise for the prevention of diabetes and will be 
provided with a pedometer. Participants will subsequently be instructed to attempt to walk at 
least 10,[ADDRESS_707973] their step data.
As shown in Table 1, 
the following data will 
be collected at visit 
two (Week 0), visit 
three (4 weeks), and 
visit four (12 weeks).  
After randomization, 
all subjects will 
receive 90 days 
worth of study 
medication in the 
form of either 
Metformin or Placebo 
(i.e.- nearly identical 
Calcium carbonate 
[CaCO 3]) as prepared and labelled by [CONTACT_542469][INVESTIGATOR_542454], Susan 
Kunkel, PharmD. Subjects will start on doses of Metformin [ADDRESS_707974]. 
FDA Regulatory Considerations: Metformin has an excellent long-term safety record and is 
already FDA approved for utilization in prediabetes. As such, attainment of an FDA IND is not 
necessary for this study. CaCO 3 is being administered in a manner consistent with current 
guidelines: 1000 mg of elemental calcium are recommended per day for adults, and our dosage 
delivers 780 mg of elemental calcium daily 
(https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/winter11/articles/winter11pg12.html).Table 1: Study Visit Summary

Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 8 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018Lifestyle Intervention: All study participants will be educated in the importance of lifestyle 
modification in a manner consistent with the Diabetes Prevention Program [122], and all 
subjects will be expected to follow these instructions throughout the course of the [ADDRESS_707975] reduction in 
total calories (500-1000 kcal/d) each day [123], as is consistent with the recommendations 
of the American Diabetes Association [124]. We will also ask participants to approach the 
physical activity recommendations of the Diabetes Prevention Program by [CONTACT_542470] 10,[ADDRESS_707976] five days per week [125]. This amount of exercise will 
approximate the 150 minutes of moderately strenuous exercise achieved by [CONTACT_542471].  
Study Population:  
We will recruit 
potential subjects 
with prediabetes 
from the 
Endocrinology 
Clinics, from the 
CTSC participant 
recruitment service, 
and from the UNM 
Prediabetes Cohort 
Registry. This latter 
registry is the result 
of a small CDC-
sponsored study 
performed at UNM 
a few years ago 
that identified 104 
subjects with prediabetes out of 218 at-risk subjects who were screened (HRRC # 11-422) 
[126]. These subjects agreed to be contact[CONTACT_542472]. We will also employ CTSC-sponsored social media to recruit for this study, if 
necessary. We do not anticipate much difficulty identifying subjects who are interested in 
participating in this study. We estimate that 50 adults at risk for diabetes will need to be 
screened to find 30 eligible subjects with prediabetes to enroll in this study.
Data Analysis: For continuous variables (i.e.- A1c, Body Mass Index, HOMA-IR index, Body 
Composition, LC3 Score, TFEB Score, Total DNA Methylation, and Galectin-3 
concentrations), we will analyze the change from baseline (Week 0) at Week [ADDRESS_707977] for frequency data, as 
appropriate.Table 2: Study Outcome Measures

Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 9 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018Sample Size Determination and Power:  Primary outcome variables for this study are 
“increase in LC3 Score from baseline” for Aim 1, “increase in total DNA methylation” for Aim 
2, and “decrease in A1c” from baseline” for Aim 3. Secondary outcome variables (not 
powered) are TFEB score for Aim 1, Galectin-3 concentrations for Aim 2, and BMI and 
HOMA-IR index (using fasting glucose and insulin) for Aim 3. These outcome variables are 
summarized in Table 2.  We will enroll 30 subjects into this study and assume a dropout rate 
of 20%, leaving 12 subjects per group for data analysis. Sensitivity analysis will also be 
performed with an “intention to treat” analysis using the last value carried forward for 
subjects who dropped out.  
For Aim 1, with 12 subjects per group, a difference in change in LC3 Score from baseline of 
8±4 Dots Per Cell (DPC) for Metformin vs. 3±[ADDRESS_707978] with α = 0.05 and β = 0.83. Baseline LC3 score is 
assumed to be 2±[ADDRESS_707979]. Deretic’s previous in vitro studies.
LC3 is our primary outcome variable for Aim 1. During the process of autophagy, 
autophagosomes engulf cytoplasmic components and concomitantly, the cytosolic form of 
LC3 (LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidyl ethanolamine, resulting in the autophagosomal 
membrane-bound form (LC3-II). LC3-II is a widely used marker to monitor autophagosome 
formation by [CONTACT_542473]3-labeled puncta (autophagosomes, or “dots”) 
per cell detected by [CONTACT_542474].  An increase in LC3 puncta formation denotes 
an increase in autophagic activity. The Deretic Lab has employed this technique in many 
different cell types, including human monocyte-derived macrophage cells (MDMs). Here, 
MDMs from human subject donors will be cultured and adhered in full media in [ADDRESS_707980] endogenous LC3 using Anti-LC3 polyclonal 
antibody (MBL P036) and a secondary fluorescent antibody. Plates will then be imaged 
using a Cellomics HCS scanner. This device will automatically capture cell images while 
identifying and quantifying LC3 puncta according to pre-set parameters in the HCS Studio 
software. This approach eliminates the problems of user subjectivity inherent in conventional 
microscopy studies while generating sufficient data from many hundreds of cells for robust 
and reproducible studies.
For Aim 2, we will employ the Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO). This kit quantitates the amount of methylated DNA in a 60 ng sample of isolated 
DNA from PBMCs relative to a methylated control sample. Gomes and colleagues described 
a study comparing the total DNA methylation of young (26.5 years) and older (70.8 years) 
healthy subjects. They found a pattern of relative DNA hypo-methylation among the older 
subjects: 18.2±1.6% in the older subjects versus 21.9±3.0% in the younger subjects [127]. 
With [ADDRESS_707981] a difference of this magnitude with α = 0.05 and β 
= 0.82.  
For Aim 3, with 12 subjects per group, a difference in change in A1c from baseline of 
0.7±0.4% for Metformin vs. 0.2±0.4% for Placebo can be detected with using a two-tailed 
unpaired t-test with α = 0.05 and β = 0.83. Baseline A1c is assumed to be 6.1±0.4% and not 
different between groups.
Potential Challenges:  If adherence to lifestyle modification is significantly different between 
groups, this could become an important confounder. If this occurs, we will perform a

3.2. Describe blinding, if applicable
Study investigators will be blinded as to study assignment of those [ADDRESS_707982]. Kunkel.
4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
4.1. Describe how individuals will be screened for eligibility.
Screening will occur at the UNM CTSC Clinical Research Unit.
Inclusion criteria will comprise individuals aged 30-70 years (inclusive) with prediabetes 
(defined as an A1c of 5.7-6.4%) and a BMI between 27 and 40 kg/m2 (inclusive).
Exclusion criteria will include prior treatment with metformin or other diabetes medications, 
pregnancy, the presence of significant renal dysfunction (Serum Creatinine > 1.3 mg/dl for 
women, > 1.4 mg/dl for men), severe hepatic dysfunction (AST or ALT > 3 times the upper 
limit of normal), ongoing alcohol or substance abuse, inflammatory bowel disease, ongoing 
glucocorticoid therapy, or inability to render informed consent.
 
4.2. Describe the criteria that define who will be included or excluded in your final study 
sample.
Inclusion criteria will comprise individuals aged 30-70 years (inclusive) with prediabetes 
(defined as an A1c of 5.7-6.4%) and a BMI between 27 and 40 kg/m2 (inclusive).
Exclusion criteria will include prior treatment with metformin or other diabetes medications, 
pregnancy, the presence of significant renal dysfunction (Serum Creatinine > 1.3 mg/dl for 
women, > 1.4 mg/dl for men), severe hepatic dysfunction (AST or ALT > 3 times the upper 
limit of normal), ongoing alcohol or substance abuse, inflammatory bowel disease, ongoing 
glucocorticoid therapy, or inability to render informed consent.
During the screening assessments, we will employ the AUDIT questionnaire to determine 
whether the participant’s behaviors constitute alcohol abuse.  The AUDIT questionnaire 
(attached) has been added to the “Supporting Documents” section of the proposal.  A score 
of 13 or more in a female, or 15 or more in a male, will constitute an exclusionary criterion 
for the study.
For the purposes of excluding other drugs of abuse, we will simply ask the participant the 
following question: “Have you used heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine, or misused other 
narcotic drugs, over the past 30 days?”  A yes response will constitute an exclusionary 
criterion for the study.
For women of child-bearing age, exclusion criteria include current pregnancy. Further, they 
must agree to not get pregnant during this study and to use an effective method of birth 
control during the course of the study.  
4.3. Indicate specifically whether you will include each of the following special populations: 
(You may not include members of the above populations as subjects in your research 
unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.)

LC3 (LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidyl ethanolamine, resulting in the autophagosomal 
membrane-bound form (LC3-II). LC3-II is a widely used marker to monitor autophagosome 
formation by [CONTACT_542473]3-labeled puncta (autophagosomes, or “dots”) 
per cell detected by [CONTACT_542474].  An increase in LC3 puncta formation denotes 
an increase in autophagic activity. The Deretic Lab has employed this technique in many 
different cell types, including human monocyte-derived macrophage cells (MDMs). Here, 
MDMs from human subject donors will be cultured and adhered in full media in [ADDRESS_707985] endogenous LC3 using Anti-LC3 polyclonal 
antibody (MBL P036) and a secondary fluorescent antibody. Plates will then be imaged 
using a Cellomics HCS scanner. This device will automatically capture cell images while 
identifying and quantifying LC3 puncta according to pre-set parameters in the HCS Studio 
software. This approach eliminates the problems of user subjectivity inherent in conventional 
microscopy studies while generating sufficient data from many hundreds of cells for robust 
and reproducible studies.

Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 12 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018For Aim 2, we will employ the Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO). This kit quantitates the amount of methylated DNA in a 60 ng sample of isolated 
DNA from PBMCs relative to a methylated control sample. Gomes and colleagues described 
a study comparing the total DNA methylation of young (26.5 years) and older (70.8 years) 
healthy subjects. They found a pattern of relative DNA hypo-methylation among the older 
subjects: 18.2±1.6% in the older subjects versus 21.9±3.0% in the younger subjects [127]. 
With [ADDRESS_707986] a difference of this magnitude with α = 0.05 and β 
= 0.82.  
For Aim 3, with 12 subjects per group, a difference in change in A1c from baseline of 
0.7±0.4% for Metformin vs. 0.2±0.4% for Placebo can be detected with using a two-tailed 
unpaired t-test with α = 0.05 and β = 0.83. Baseline A1c is assumed to be 6.1±0.4% and not 
different between groups.
6. Study Timelines
6.1. Describe:
The duration of an individual subject’s participation in the research
The duration anticipated to enroll all subjects
The expected duration for the investigators to complete the study (complete analysis)
Participation in this study by [CONTACT_542475] a total of approximately 6-10 hours over 
a period of 12 weeks, and 4 visits to the UNM HSC Clinical Research Unit will be required 
(including the initial screening visit).  Total time to complete sample processing and analysis is 
estimated to be approximately 3 months subsequent to the end of data collection.  The entire 
study, from the beginning of funding and enrollment to the end of the funding cycle is estimated 
to be one year.
           
7. Study Endpoints
7.1. Describe the primary and secondary study endpoints.
AIM 1: Demonstrate that Metformin therapy will increase cellular autophagy as an 
inverse correlate of aging as measured by [CONTACT_542464]3 and TFEB scores. 
Hypothesis 1: In addition to beneficial effects on glycemia, body weight, and body 
composition, Metformin therapy exerts beneficial effects on surrogate measures of 
autophagy and aging.
Primary outcome: Increased levels of LC3 in leukocytes.
AIM 2: Demonstrate that Metformin therapy will mitigate evidence of aging as 
measured by [CONTACT_542476] 3 among 
adults with prediabetes. 
Hypothesis 2: Metformin therapy exerts beneficial effects on DNA methylation as measures 
of aging
Primary outcome: Increased DNA methylation in leukocytes.
AIM 3: Monitor the beneficial metabolic effects of Metformin in adults with 
prediabetes. Hypothesis 3: Metformin therapy will elicit the expected beneficial effects on 
glycemia, body weight, insulin resistance, and body composition demonstrated in previous 
studies.

for this study, if necessary. We do not anticipate having difficulty identifying subjects who 
are interested in participating in this study. We estimate that [ADDRESS_707988]’s blood draw will be conducted utilizing 
dedicated bench space in the CTSC T1 laboratory.  Cell purification will carry along no 
personal identifiers, only the blinded numeric assignment, and utilize Ficoll gradient 
separation for isolation of the mononuclear layer.  The services of the T1 Lab will also be 
used for subsequent RNA purifications, cDNA production, qRT-PCR, DNA Methylation 
measurements, and assay quantifications.  
Cultured cells labeled with the blinded numeric assigned will be transferred to the 
laboratories of [CONTACT_542493], in Fitz Hall for cell treatment and analysis. Cells 
undergoing autophagy can be identified by [CONTACT_542478]-labeled LC3 puncta 
and/or the co-localization of fluorescently labeled LC3 and lysosomal markers.  LC3 
measurements will be quantified using our Cellomics ArrayScan® VTI HCS Reader with a 
fully automated microscope featuring Zeiss optics for HTS high-content screening of 96

13. Data Analysis
13.1. Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.
13.2. Provide a power analysis
For Aim 1, with 12 subjects per group, a difference in change in LC3 Score from baseline of 
8±4 Dots Per Cell (DPC) for Metformin vs. 3±[ADDRESS_707993] with α = 0.05 and β = 0.83. Baseline LC3 score is 
assumed to be 2±[ADDRESS_707994]. Deretic’s previous in vitro studies.
LC3 is our primary outcome variable for Aim 1. During the process of autophagy, 
autophagosomes engulf cytoplasmic components and concomitantly, the cytosolic form of 
LC3 (LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidyl ethanolamine, resulting in the autophagosomal 
membrane-bound form (LC3-II). LC3-II is a widely used marker to monitor autophagosome 
formation by [CONTACT_542473]3-labeled puncta (autophagosomes, or “dots”) 
per cell detected by [CONTACT_542474].  An increase in LC3 puncta formation denotes 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 19 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018an increase in autophagic activity. The Deretic Lab has employed this technique in many 
different cell types, including human monocyte-derived macrophage cells (MDMs). Here, 
MDMs from human subject donors will be cultured and adhered in full media in [ADDRESS_707995] endogenous LC3 using Anti-LC3 polyclonal 
antibody (MBL P036) and a secondary fluorescent antibody. Plates will then be imaged 
using a Cellomics HCS scanner. This device will automatically capture cell images while 
identifying and quantifying LC3 puncta according to pre-set parameters in the HCS Studio 
software. This approach eliminates the problems of user subjectivity inherent in conventional 
microscopy studies while generating sufficient data from many hundreds of cells for robust 
and reproducible studies.
For Aim 2, we will employ the Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MO). This kit quantitates the amount of methylated DNA in a 60 ng sample of isolated 
DNA from PBMCs relative to a methylated control sample. Gomes and colleagues described 
a study comparing the total DNA methylation of young (26.5 years) and older (70.8 years) 
healthy subjects. They found a pattern of relative DNA hypo-methylation among the older 
subjects: 18.2±1.6% in the older subjects versus 21.9±3.0% in the younger subjects [127]. 
With [ADDRESS_707996] a difference of this magnitude with α = 0.05 and β 
= 0.82.  
For Aim 3, with 12 subjects per group, a difference in change in A1c from baseline of 
0.7±0.4% for Metformin vs. 0.2±0.4% for Placebo can be detected with using a two-tailed 
unpaired t-test with α = 0.05 and β = 0.83. Baseline A1c is assumed to be 6.1±0.4% and not 
different between groups.
Potential Challenges:  If adherence to lifestyle modification is significantly different between 
groups, this could become an important confounder. If this occurs, we will perform a 
Repeated Measures ANCOVA using “steps per day” and “change in body mass” as 
covariates.
14. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects
This section is required when research involves more than Minimal Risk to subjects. Describe:
14.1. The entity (e.g., DMC, DSMB) or individuals (e.g., medical monitor) who will perform 
data and safety monitoring.  Describe whether they are independent of or affiliated with 
the sponsor or investigator.  If a DMC or DSMB is planned, describe the composition 
of the committee or board. Generally, a DSMB or DMC should be composed of experts 
in all scientific disciplines needed to analyze and interpret the data (e.g., 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_187543], biostatisticians, subject matter experts).
We will employ [CONTACT_542494], MD, to act as an independent monitor in the 
capacity of our Data Safety and Monitoring Board. [CONTACT_542495] is independent of this 
study and has no vested interest in its outcome.  Treatment for diabetes in this study is 
consistent with current standard of care, and the risks of Metformin or CaCO [ADDRESS_707997]. Schade’s review each year prior to protocol

Adverse event rates will be compared following conclusion of the study.
14.6. The conditions that would trigger a suspension or termination of the research (i.e., 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]), if appropriate.
An unexpected high rate of SAEs (40% or greater) would prompt unblinding and 
investigation to see if these events are clustered in one group or another.  If that is the 
case, the DSMB and the IRB would be consulted to see if cessation of the study is 
warranted.  
14.7. The plan for reporting findings to the sponsor, investigators, and HRRC.
AE reporting will be to the HRRC as is standard for clinical trials.

study treatment, study drug assignment, and results at the conclusion of the study.
15.3. Describe any procedures for partial withdrawal (e.g., from procedures but allowing 
continued data collection by [CONTACT_72634], phone contact, etc.).
We will attempt to schedule a study close-out visit for any participant who is withdrawn 
from the study. Failing that, we will attempt to conduct an exit interview via telephone.
15.4. Describe the disposition of existing data/specimens when a subject withdraws.  
Describe any restrictions on a subject’s ability to withdraw any already gathered data 
or specimens (e.g., unable to retrieve because it has been stripped of identifiers and

Not applicable.
16.10. Describe if data will be collected, transmitted, and/or stored via the internet, the 
identifiability of the data, and the security measures that will be employed to protect it.
Some data will be stored on the UNM HSC secure H drive, as is consistent with 
current guidelines.  Working data will be entered into REDCap through the UNM CTSC 
Biomedical Informatics Service.
16.11. Describe if data will be collected by [CONTACT_86675], how the recordings will 
be secured, whether and when recordings will be transcribed, if the transcription will

banking in the consent and authorization, using opt-in procedures, and the procedures 
for subjects to request withdrawal of their data or specimens and any limitations on 
their ability to do so. 
Not applicable.
18. Risks to Subjects
18.1. List the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or inconveniences to the 
subjects related the subjects’ participation in the research.  Describe the probability, 
magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the risks. Consider physical, psychological, 
social, legal, and economic risks.  Note that almost all research includes confidentiality 
risks.
Study medication risks: Participants may experience some side effects from the study 
medication.  Approximately 20% of patients experience gastrointestinal bloating with 
Metformin, but these symptoms tend to improve over time. Some of the more common side 
effects of metformin include abdominal or stomach discomfort, cough or hoarseness, 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast or shallow breathing, fevers or chills, a general feeling of 
discomfort, lower back or side pain, muscle pain or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], painful or difficult urination, 
and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  Less common side effects of metformin include anxiety, blurred vision, 
chest discomfort, cold sweats, coma, confusion, cool or pale skin, depression, difficult or 
labored breathing, dizziness, fast or irregular or pounding or racing heartbeat, a feeling of 
warmth, headache, increased hunger, increased sweating, nausea, nervousness, redness 
of the face or neck or arms or upper chest, seizures, shortness of breath, slurred speech, 
tightness in the chest, unusual tiredness or weakness, or wheezing.  Rare side effects of 
metformin include a behavior change similar to being drunk, difficulty with concentration, 
drowsiness, lack or loss of strength, or restless sleep. 
There are no known serious side effects to the CaCO 3 Placebo therapy.  There is a 
theoretical increased risk of kidney stones in a patient who is predisposed to them (< 1%).  
CaCO3 may also cause mild gas, bloating, or constipation in up to 30% of participants. 
CaCO3 may also interfere with the absorption of certain other drugs from your 
gastrointestinal tract. These medications include certain antibiotics (quinolones, 
tetracycline), certain osteoporosis medications (alendronate, residronate), heart and blood 
pressure medications (digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), thyroid hormone 
(levothyroxine), and diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide).  Additionally, estrogen therapy might 
increase the absorption of CaCO3 from the gut.  For the most part, these effects can be 
avoided by [CONTACT_542482]. Subjects will be 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 24 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018instructed to report any side effects they experience while taking part in this study to their 
study doctor or study personnel.    
Blood drawing risks:  Drawing blood may cause temporary pain and discomfort from the 
needle stick.  Bruising at the site of the needle insertion, sweating, feeling faint or 
lightheaded and, in rare cases, infection may also occur.  There is also a < 1% chance of 
passing out briefly during blood draws. If this occurs, subjects will be asked to lie down and 
rest until they feel better.   All blood draws will occur in a clinical setting and will be 
performed by a phlebotomist who is trained in aseptic technique and in recognizing the 
signs of distress. After the blood draw, a bandage and care instructions will be provided.  In 
the event that the subject feels faint or shaky after the blood draw, they may be provided 
with a small snack.
According to common medical study guidelines, subjects should not donate too 
much blood at one time, and though the total amount of blood to be obtained during this 
[ADDRESS_708000] the blood donor 
they should plan not to donate blood until after 8 weeks after the completion of the study.
Allergic reaction:  Although allergies to Metformin are rare, there is a risk of allergic 
reaction with any drug. Subjects will be advised of the symptoms of an allergic reaction that 
may include, but are not limited to, trouble breathing, fast heart rate, rash, dizziness, itching, 
and swelling. They will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_402865], or present to the 
nearest emergency room if they experience any of these symptoms.
Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis:  This procedure has been shown to cause mild skin 
irritation from electrode adhesives, or temporary discomfort, although this is rare.   We will 
not perform this test in people with a lot of metal in their body (such as a metal hip or other 
joint replacement), those with amputations, those who have received radiographic contrast 
material within the last [ADDRESS_708001] results.
Reproductive Risks:  There are no known reproductive risks in this study, and Metformin has 
been used safely during pregnancy on many occasions.  Nevertheless, we will not recruit 
subjects in this study who are pregnant. Women of child-bearing age who are enrolled will be 
requested to employ an acceptable method of birth control (condoms or other barrier method, 
birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], an IUD, or long-acting implantable contraception) for the duration of the study 
and to notify study personnel immediately if they become pregnant during the course of this 
study.  
General: There are risks of stress, emotional distress, inconvenience and possible loss of 
privacy and confidentiality associated with participating in any research study. Subjects will 
be informed that they can discuss these concerns and any others regarding the study by 
[CONTACT_542483].
18.2. If applicable, indicate which procedures may have risks to the subjects that are 
currently unforeseeable.
Not applicable.
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 25 of 48Version Date: May 8,201818.3. If applicable, indicate which procedures may have risks to an embryo or fetus should 
the subject be or become pregnant.  If pregnancy testing or birth control provisions are 
required, describe these.
Metformin and CaCO [ADDRESS_708002] been used safely in many pregnancies, but pregnant 
women will not be allowed to participate in this study.
18.4. If applicable, describe risks to others who are not subjects.
Not applicable.
18.5. Describe the steps being taken to minimize the probability or magnitude of risks.
Metformin (1500 mg daily) and CaCO3 (1944 mg) are being titrated up to full dose 
slowly.
Note: All risks described here should also be described in the consent document.
19. Potential Benefits to Subjects
19.1. Describe the potential benefits that individual subjects may experience from taking part 
in the research. Include as may be useful for the IRB’s consideration, the probability, 
magnitude, and duration of the potential benefits.
19.2. Indicate if there is no direct benefit. Do not include benefits to society or others in this 
section.
Note: All potential benefits described here should also be described in the consent 
document.
Although some subjects may lose a small amount of weight with Metformin therapy, 
there may be no direct benefit to them from participating in this study.  However, it is 
hoped that information gained from this study will help in the future understanding and 
treatment of prediabetes and further, help us better understand whether or not 
Metformin might result in anti-aging effects on cells.
20. Recruitment Methods
20.1. Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.
20.2. Describe the methods that will be used to identify potential subjects (e.g., chart review, 
referral, etc.). 
20.3. Describe materials that will be used to recruit subjects (e.g., emails, scripts, 
advertisements, brochures, flyers, etc.). Attach draft copi[INVESTIGATOR_542458]. Once the draft has been approved, the final 
copy of the printed material, audio or video recording must be submitted for review and 
approval prior to implementation.  Please see Worksheet HRP-315 for information on 
advertisement standards.
We will recruit potential subjects with prediabetes from the Endocrinology Clinics, from 
the CTSC participant recruitment service, and from the UNM Prediabetes Cohort 
Registry. This latter registry is the result of a small CDC-sponsored study performed at 
UNM a few years ago that identified 104 subjects with prediabetes out of 218 at-risk 
subjects who were screened (HRRC # 11-422) [126]. These subjects agreed to be 
contact[CONTACT_542484]. We will also employ 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 26 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018CTSC-sponsored social media to recruit for this study, if necessary. We do not 
anticipate much difficulty identifying subjects who are interested in participating in this 
study. We estimate that [ADDRESS_708003] subjects’ privacy interests. “Privacy” 
refers to persons and their interest in controlling the access that others have to 
themselves.  For example, based on their privacy interests, people may want to 
control:
The time and place/setting where they are examined or provide information
The nature of the information they provide
The nature of the experiences they are exposed to 
Who may observe or have access to information about them
For example, individuals may not want to be approached for participation, provide 
responses to a research interview, or undergo a research procedure in a location 
where they may be seen or overheard.
The CTSC Participant Recruitment Service maintains a “do not call” list, and we will 
abide by [CONTACT_542485].  Calls to potential participants will be will be made during 
working hours.  If that proves unsuccessful in contact[CONTACT_62896], one or two calls 
might be made in the evening hours. Study personnel will describe the study and 
gauge the subject’s interest.  
21.2. Describe the steps that will be taken to protect subjects’ privacy including privacy 
protections during recruitment, consent, and data collection. Issues related to data are 
addressed in the Data Management/Confidentiality Section.
Contact [CONTACT_542486], as per PRS policy. 
22. Economic Burden to Subjects
22.1. Describe any costs that subjects may be responsible for because of participation in the 
research.  Clearly stipulate what procedures are standard of care and what procedures 
are research-related in the table below. Please place an X in the box for the 
responsible party for each procedure involved.
List any costs to participants (or their 3rd party payer); include any charges for study 
procedures, visits, or drug/devices.
No costs will be incurred by [CONTACT_542487].

22.5. Ensure that the cost section of the consent form reflects the cost that are covered by 
[CONTACT_203611] (or 3rd party payers) are responsible.
Done.
23. Compensation
23.1. Describe any plans for compensation or reimbursement for subjects (amounts, 
methods (e.g., cash card), and payment schedule).  Describe why the proposed 
amount is reasonable and appropriate for the subjects’ time and inconvenience.  Credit 
for payment should be prorated and not be contingent upon the participant completing 
the entire study.  Any amount paid as bonus for completion of the entire study should 
not be so great that it could unduly induce subjects to remain in the study when they 
otherwise would have withdrawn.  Note: Consult with your department official for 
reporting requirements associated with cash or merchandise cards distributed to 
research subjects.
In return for time and effort participating in this study, subjects will be compensated up 
to $[ADDRESS_708005] worth $30 will be given for 
each of the four study visits. If they do not complete the study, they will be paid $[ADDRESS_708006] administered by [CONTACT_542488].  We do not feel this is an amount that will unduly influence subjects to 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 28 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018participate or remain in the study when they otherwise would withdraw. If we are 
having difficulty enrolling patients because of the low rate of reimbursement, we may 
approach the HRRC to increase the amount being offered.
24. Compensation for Research-Related Injury
24.1. If the research involves more than Minimal Risk to subjects, describe the plan for 
compensation in the event of research related injury.
24.2. If subjects are responsible for seeking their own form of care for research-related 
injury, describe how this will be communicated and what options are available to 
participants.
“No commitment is made by [CONTACT_193688] 
(UNM HSC) to provide free medical care or money for injuries to participants in this 
study. If you are injured or become sick as a result of this study, UNM HSC will provide 
you with emergency treatment at your cost. It is important for you to tell your study 
doctor immediately if you have been injured or become sick because of taking part in 
this study. If you have any questions about these issues, or believe that you have been 
treated carelessly in the study, please contact [CONTACT_542489] (HRRC) at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, 
Albuquerque, New Mexico [ZIP_CODE], ([PHONE_11247] for more information.”  
25. Consent Process
25.1. Indicate whether you will you be obtaining consent, and if so describe:
25.1.1. Who will be responsible for obtaining consent and their qualifications/training to 
do so.  Be certain to identify which study team members will obtain consent in

during the screening visit.  If participants desire more time to think about it, they 
will be granted that time. 
25.1.3. The steps that will be taken to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue 
influence.
We will make it clear that the study is entirely voluntary.
25.1.4. The waiting period available between reviewing the study and consent with the 
potential subject and obtaining the consent.
The study design is simple, so we feel that most potential participants will be 
ready to make a decision after having the study described and reviewing the 
consent form.  For those who require more time, they will be provided a copy of 
the consent form and allowed to return at their convenience, if desired. 
25.1.5. Processes to ensure ongoing consent throughout the study.
Any unhappy participants will be reminded that they have the right to withdraw 
from the study at any time.
25.1.6. Any steps that will be taken to enhance understanding.
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 29 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018We will use the “teach-back” method to ensure that potential participants 
understand the study procedures.
25.1.7. Any procedure/testing for ensuring that the consent is understood by [CONTACT_38822] (e.g., teach back).

but we may revisit this issue if we are having difficulty enrolling subjects.
25.1.9. If you anticipate enrolling subjects who do not understand or have limited fluency 
in English, describe the process to ensure that the oral and written information 
provided to those subjects initially and throughout their participation will be in the 
language they understand (e.g., use of translations and interpreters). Please note 
that translations of consent documents and subject materials will likely be 
required once the content of the English-language version is approved.
Not applicable.
25.1.10. Short-form consent documents are available for unanticipated enrollments of 
persons who don’t understand or have limited fluency in English.  However, 
based upon the nature of the research (e.g., clinical trials) subsequent translation 
of the consent document may be required so that the subject has access to 
written information about the research in a language they understand.
Not applicable.
Cognitively Impaired Adults/Adults Unable to Consent/Use of a Legally Authorized 
Representative

research that equitably involves all partners in the research process and recognizes 
the unique strengths that each brings. Community-based Participatory Research 
begins with a research topic of importance to the community, has the aim of combining 
knowledge with action and achieving social change to improve health outcomes and 
eliminate health disparities.
Not applicable.
31. Research Involving American Indian/Native Populations
31.1. Please provide detailed information of the local research context including how the 
research questions are sensitive to community attitudes and how the PI [INVESTIGATOR_542459]: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 35 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018ascertained that the proposed research is acceptable to the local population in terms 
of tribal regulations, applicable law and standards of professional conduct and 
practice.  Attach any supporting documents from tribal officials or entities addressing 
the status or requirements for review of the research activity from tribal officials or 
tribal entities (for example, Indian Health Services, the Navajo Nation IRB).  
This research proposal is not specifically geared toward members of any one 
community, nor will we exclude members of any community. As American 
Indian/Native populations do experience significant levels of prediabetes, however, 
and as our local population includes a significant number of Native American persons, 
we expect that our research recruitment will include subjects from this population and 
that our findings would be applicable and of interest to them.
32. Transnational Research
32.1. When conducting transnational research, you must ensure that subjects are provided 
equivalent and appropriate protections for human subjects located outside of the 
[LOCATION_002].  Please refer to the following website for current OHRP interpretations 
of research standards, equivalent protections, and for a current compi[INVESTIGATOR_542460]. 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/international/index.html 
32.2.Location: Describe the research locale and how and why the setting was chosen.  
Describe significant cultural norms, local laws, and differences with U.S. culture with 
respect to autonomy, perception of research, recruitment, consent, age of majority, 
parental permission, etc.  
32.3.Study Personnel: Describe the qualifications of the researcher and research team to 
perform research in the community/culture where it will occur.  Indicate the research 
team’s ability to speak, read, and write the language of the subjects.  Describe the 
researcher’s knowledge of or expertise in local or state laws, culture, and community 
norms. Indicate if the researcher was invited into the community (provide 
documentation, if available).  If not invited, then describe how the researcher will have 
culturally appropriate access to the community.
32.4.Consent: Describe the consenting procedure that you intend to use for the research 
and why it is appropriate for the community where the research will occur.  Describe 
how you will ensure that potential subjects understand the research, and the 
voluntariness of their participation.
32.5.Community Consultation: Describe any plans for community consultation to assess 
receptiveness to the proposed research and to obtain feedback on how it should be 
conducted and any limitations or boundaries that should be respected.  Describe plans 
for dissemination of results to subjects and to the community. 
Not applicable.
33. Drugs or Devices
33.1. If the research involves drugs or devices, describe your plans to store, handle, and 
administer those drugs or devices so that they will be used only on subjects and be 
used only by [CONTACT_10733].
We will use the UNM Investigational Pharmacy to package, label and deliver study 
drug.  Study drug may be stored in the CTSC pharmacy for 1 or 2 days prior to 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 36 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018participant appointments. After randomization, all subjects will receive study 
medication in the form of either Metformin or Placebo (i.e.- nearly identical CaCO 3) as 
prepared and labelled by [CONTACT_542469][INVESTIGATOR_542454], Susan Kunkel, 
PharmD.  Subjects who choose to withdraw from the study will be required to return 
unused study medications provided to them.  Metformin has an excellent long-term 
safety record and is already FDA approved for utilization in the setting of prediabetes.  
As such, attainment of an FDA IND is not necessary for this study.
33.2. If the drug is investigational (has an IND), identify the holder of the 
IND/IDE/Abbreviated IDE.
No IND is necessary. Meformin is currently approved for use in prediabetes.  CaCO 3 
Placebo has no known anti-diabetes activity.
33.3. For research involving drugs, complete and attach a signed “Drug Attachment”, 
available in Click or the HRPO website.
A signed “Drug Attachment” form is attached.
33.4. For research involving devices, complete the “Device Checklist” in the Checklist

because the records review itself is non-invasive and the results of the 
records review will not be used for any purposes other than those 
described above.
 True
 Other justification:      
b) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare 
of the subjects because eligible subjects will be approached for 
consent to participate in the research and are free to decline.  Further, 
the information accessed during the records review will not be 
disclosed to anyone without a legitimate purpose (e.g., verification of 
eligibility).
 True
 Other justification:      
c) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver 
or alteration because there is no other reasonably efficient and 
effective way to identify who to approach for possible participation in 
the research.  
 True
 Other justification:      
d) Whenever appropriate, potentially eligible subjects will be presented 
with information about the research and asked to consider 
participation.  (Regulatory criteria: Whenever appropriate, the subjects 
will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
participation.)

commonly requested when the research does not include any opportunity for 
interaction with subjects (e.g., chart review).
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes
Page 40 of 48Version Date: May 8,2018Note: FDA-regulated research is not eligible for a full waiver of consent using these 
criteria.  If you believe that your FDA-regulated research may be eligible for a waiver 
under another mechanism, such as planned emergency research, contact [CONTACT_86686].
Not applicable.
1. Are you requesting a waiver for some or all subjects?
 All
 Some. Explain:      
2. Provide justification for each of the following regulatory criteria:
a) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects:
     
b) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare 
of the subjects:
     
c) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver 
or alteration:
     
d) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional

or certain subject groups (e.g., retrospective cohort) and the research involves the 
evaluation of a public benefit or service program.  
1. Are you requesting a waiver for some or all subjects?
 All
 Some. Explain:      
2. Provide justification for each of the following regulatory criteria:
a) The research or demonstration project is to be conducted by [CONTACT_32115], evaluate, or otherwise examine: (i) public benefit or 
service programs; (ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or services 
under those programs; (iii) possible changes in or alternatives to 
those programs or procedures; or (iv) possible changes in methods or 
levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs:
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Anti-Aging, Pro-
Autophagy Effects of Metformin in Adults with Prediabetes

review).
1. Are you requesting a waiver of authorization for some or all subjects?
 All
 Some. Explain: Medical records at UNM.
2. Describe your plan to protect health information identifiers from improper use 
and disclosure:
A master key to link unique identifiers will be maintained in a separate file on 
a secure UNM computer and the H drive in [CONTACT_542496]’s folder.
3. Describe your plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent 
with conduct of the research (absent a health or research justification for 
retaining them or a legal requirement to do so):
Identifiers will be destroyed when the study is closed.
4. Describe why the research could not practicably be conducted without the 
waiver or alteration:
Retention of identifiers helps make sure participants qualify for the study, 
allows the study team to make certain of drugs and doses that the patient is 
receiving, facilitates communication with the participant, and enhances 
participant safety.
5. The PHI accessed or recorded for identification/screening purposes will not 
be reused or disclosed to (shared with) any other person or entity, except as 
required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other 
research for which the use or disclosure of the PHI would be permitted under 
the Privacy Rule.

1. Background and Rationale   
1.1. Background and Scientific Rationale  
Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disease complicated by [CONTACT_694851]  (Higaki et al., 1999; Travers et al., 2001; Ricci et al., 2003; Sugimoto et al., 2006; De  Bendetto et al., 
2009).  The skin of AD patients is highly susceptible to infections by [CONTACT_419939], bacteria, and fungi. These microorganisms 
interact with the human immune system to trigger the onset  of, or exacerbate the disease. Studies suggest that 7 -10% 
of AD participants have difficulty containing infections caused by [CONTACT_694852] (HSV), vaccin ia 
virus (VV ); causing eczema herpeticum (EH),  eczema vaccinatum  (EV),  and molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) ( 60). 
Preliminary data in the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network ( ADRN ) Registry study indicate 40% of AD participant s and 
only 2% of non -atopi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (NA) are S. aureus  colonized on lesional and/ or non -lesional skin. Thes e observations are 
consistent with the understanding that patients with AD have defects in innate and adaptive immune responses and 
thus have a general defect in the control of skin infections.  
Several lines of experimental evidence support the concept tha t the  multiple defects in epi[INVESTIGATOR_694790], a state of microbial imbalance , and that this dysbiosis then promotes the  immunological disorder 
characteristic of AD . Dysbiosis in AD has been shown to be closely associated with  disease severity ( Kong et al., 2012 a). 
Antibiotic therapy is a mainstay of treatment for normalization of dysbiosis ; however , antibiotic treatment 
nonspecifically kills bacteria and may induce additional dysbiosis.  In addition, long- term treatments generate resistant 
bacteria. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as defensins and cathelicidins are important mediators to maintain the 
balance of epi[INVESTIGATOR_694791].  Our studies indicate that the innate immune defense of  the skin is mediated not only by 
[CONTACT_694853]’s  own cells, but also by [CONTACT_694854], such as S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_95232] S. hominis  (Lai et al., 2009;  Lai et al., 2010; Cogen et al., 2010 a; Cogen 
et al.,  2010b ). Previously  published  data (Nakatsuji et al., 2017 ) suggest that AD skin colonized by S. aureus  has a lower 
frequency of these antimicrobial Staph  species compared to  normal skin.  Studies have also shown that AD patients 
colonized by S. aureus  have more severe disease states and are prone to more frequent flares of their AD  (Kong et al., 
2012a ; Schnopp et al., 2010;  Ong et al., 2002; Kong & Segre, 2012 b). More recently, to further examine if topi[INVESTIGATOR_694792]  (CoNS ) can decrease S. aureus  survival on the skin 
of AD participant s, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_694793] (AMT) was conducted by [CONTACT_676717] – San Diego ( UCSD ) as the Investigational New Drug  (IND) Sponsor under IND# [ZIP_CODE] . Antimicrobial CoNS 
strain (s) were  isolated from the non -lesional skin of each of the 5 AD participant s who were S. aureus  culture positive  
(see Table 1.1 for active strains used for each patient) . To transiently increase their abundance, the active strain (s) of 
each participant  were expanded , mixed with Cetaphil ® lotion at 1 x107 colony forming units per gram ( CFU/g ), and then 
reapplied to the lesional forearm skin of the same participant  to get 1x105CFU/cm2, from which the active colonies were 
isolated. After 24 hours of a single application of AMT lotion,  S. aureus  CFU decreased ; whereas , vehicle (Cetaphil®  
lotion)  applied to the contralateral arm in a double -blind comparison did not (Fi gure 1.4, a-b). From these results, w e 
hypothesize that an increase in the ratio of antimicrobial S taph  to the level found on  normal  skin would normalize the 
balance of microflora in AD participant s, thereby [CONTACT_694855].  The goal of this 
study  is to develop a therapy of healthy donor -derived (allogeneic) targeted microbiome transplant  lotion  (TMT) of 
antimicrobial Staph  strain , S. hominis  A9, to help normalization of skin dysbiosis  in moderate -to-sever e AD. By 
[CONTACT_16538] S. aureus , and possibly inflammation, we propose TMT as a novel therapy for AD .

2. The total CFU applied on the skin of each participant was 1×105 CFU/ cm2. 
1.2. Rationale for Selection of Investigational Product or Intervention  
We have made a highly innovative discovery of newly recognized species such as S. hominis , as well as newly identified 
strains of S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_694795] S. aureus  while not harming the resident commensals. Because of this, these 
commensal bacteria can provide selective antimicrobial protection against pathogens on the skin surface yet maintain 
diversity. One example of such protective bacteria is a strain of S. epi [INVESTIGATOR_694796] 
(PSMs) gamma and delta ( Cogen et al., 2010a). We have shown that these helical peptides are potent against S. aureus  
in vitro  and on human skin. More recently, with the prior support of National Institute of A llergy and Infectious Diseases 
(NIAID ), we have discovered a novel S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353] -derived antibiotic we have named Firmocidin that selectively kills S. 
aureus  [including methicillin -resistant S. aureus  (MRSA) strains], group A Streptococcus  (GAS) , group B Streptococcus  
(GBS)  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Another commensal strain of S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_694797] a specific protease (esp) that 
disrupts S. aureus  biofilms and has been used successfully in a human clinical trial to decrease nasal colonization ( Iwase 
et al., 2010 ). We have also discovered that S. hominis , which is also a major commensal on the human skin, produces 
two novel AMP s we have named Hogocidin alpha and Hogocidin beta that kills S. aureus  by a different mechanism. 
These findings indicate that mu ltiple bacteria inhabiting the surface of normal human skin contribute directly to the 
skin’s antimicrobial defenses. Importantly, we have now  identified [ADDRESS_942627] by [CONTACT_694856]. Stability testing of these 4 specific strains in Cetaphil®  lotion has revealed S. hominis  and 
its antimic robial, hogocidin alpha , to be the best formulation for our targeted microbiome transplant.  This will be a 
Phase I, first in human,  clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a novel therapy for AD , a targeted microb iome 
transplant  lotion . The allogeneic  targeted microbiome transplant lotion or TMT will be composed of 50% Cetaphil ® 
lotion , 50% Vegetable glycerin , and commensal Staph species , S. hominis  A9. 
1.3. Preclinical Experience 
It has been known for decades that patients with AD have increased colonization with bacteria and are susceptible to 
infectio ns with S. aureus  and viruses such as herpes and vaccinia. An alteration in the physical barrier by [CONTACT_694857]  (FLG) (Irvine 2007 ) and our findings of a decreased antimicrobial barrier from altered expression of 
antimicrobial proteins ( Ong et al., 2002 ) have been hypothesized to contribute to the abnormal microbial colonization. 
Once the skin barrier is impaired and the expression of AMPs is reduced , it is likely that the homeostasis between host 
and microbe is shifted. This is consistent with more recent observations that show the whole skin microbial community is abnormal in AD. Several recent findings in patients with AD reveal a dramatic change in microbial community 
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  19 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  structures compared to healthy volunteers ( Kong & Serge, 2012b ; Hata & Gall o, 2008). Worsening disease and lower skin 
bacterial diversity are associated with each other. Microbial shifts are localized to sites of disease predilection. This 
suggests that ecological niches such as the antecubital and popliteal crease s are important  for the initiation of disease 
and are influenced by [CONTACT_694858] .  
Figure 1. 3a AD skin contains a microbiome that is deficient in the ability to inhibit S. aureus.  
  
Clinical improvement in AD is associated with higher bact erial diversity, indicating that current treatments that promote 
bacterial diversity promote improvement of the disease. Increases of specific bacterial genera, such as Corynebacterium , 
Streptococcus,  and Propi[INVESTIGATOR_694798] , are observed during therapy indi cating more complex species relationships 
during AD than known from culture -based methods  (Kong et al., 2012a ). Our prior work in the ADRN has further 
extended the understanding of the microbiome by [CONTACT_694859] s is d eficient in 
bacterial strains that provide anti- S. aureus activity. Figure 1 .3a shows the percentage of coagulase negative Staph that 
secretes activity  that will inhibit S. aureus  growth. The data are conservatively biased since it eliminates coagulase 
positive bacteria from the calculation.  
Each data point represents the proportion of coagulase negative Staph  isolates recovered from the surface of an 
individual participant ’s forearm skin. One hundred  isolates were measured from each individual. Bacterial colonies were 
cultured and sterile supernatant of that culture was added to S. aureus  strain  113. Suppression of the growth of S. 
aureus  was assessed in each assay by [CONTACT_694860] 
a well- defined  control strain of S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_694799] -Staph activity (negative control) and 
comparison with strains of S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_694800] -Staph activity (positive control) . 
These observations show that not only is the skin of AD patients defective in host -derived protective factors (FLG, β-  
defensins, cathelicidins, etc.) but it also has a defect in protection from the microbiome. This is important to AD because of the risk  that increased abundance of S. aureus  has to infection and because of recent observations suggesting that the 
presence of δ -toxin produced by S. aureus  will directly enhance allergic responses in mice ( Nakamura et al., 2013 ). 
Recognition that AD has a lac k of specific strains of bacteria supports the rationale behind our current proposal. Our 
microbiome transplant will inform  how to replace some of the bacteria that are necessary for normal host defense of 
the skin.  
To understand how the microbiome can dir ectly inhibit S. aureus , we have sought to identify specific strains of the 
commensal microbiome that contribute to this activity. This work has been highly successful, and we have discovered 

Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  20 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  three novel antibiotics. All are common on normal skin but are r elatively absent in AD. The activity of the products of 
two of these antimicrobial strains is illustrated in Figure 1.3b  below.

Part A  illustrates  the capacity of S. hominis  A9 (culture supernatant)  to inhibit S. aureus . Zones of inhibition of S. aureus  
are shown to illustrate heat stability, protease sensitivity,  and ammonium sulfate precipi[INVESTIGATOR_694801] S. hominis . Parts B and C  indicate  S. hominis A9 strain produces two antimicrobial component s. Part B

Hogocidin -β. Part s D and E illustrate potency of each hogocidin to kill S. aureus . The minimal bactericidal concentration 
of Hogocidin -α and Hogocidin -β was 0.[ADDRESS_942628] antimicrobial peptides.  The 
hogocidins exerted  synergistic antimicrobial activity when combined  with skin antimicrobial peptide, LL -37. Part F 
illustrates the antimicrobial dose response of Firmocidin identified in S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353] . Com parisons of potency between 
synthetic and naturally purified Firmocidin and activity of a highly potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_694802] (Benzyl peroxide) to 
inhibit GAS, GBS, Methicillin -Sensitive S. aureus  (MSSA) and MRSA are  also shown. Part s G and H  show data fro m a 
single IV dose of Firmocidin (20 mg/kg)  given to mice 24 hours after starting a deep skin infection by [CONTACT_694861] 108 CFU of GAS. Three days later mice given only one dose of Firmocidin showed no open wounds and 3 logs 
fewer bacteria at the injection site (not shown). We confirmed that these compounds are active on the skin. To test this, 

Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  21 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  we developed a method for stable formulation of commensal bacteria in a lotion base. The lotion base Cetaphil® is well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_694862] .  
Figure 1.3c below shows results of an experiment where survival of S. aureus  was measured on the skin of mice after a 
single application of bacteria shown  in Figure 1.3b . It shows that our transplant approach has a high likelihood to 
succeed in achieving the endpoint of decreasing S. aureus . 
Figure 1.3c A bacterial transplant inhibits the survival of S. aureus  on ex vivo  pig skin  (a) and mouse skin  (b). 
 
Having establish ed an association between AMP -producing commensal CoNS and colonization with S. aureus  (Figure 
1.3a), and having identified active peptides produced by [CONTACT_694863]  (Figure 1.3b ), we next sought to directly test if the 
presence of S. hominis  producing Hogocidins  (A9 strain)  will reduce colonization by S. aureus . First, we employed an ex 
vivo pig skin colonization model . In this model, peptides or bacteria were applied to the surface of sanitized pig skin on 
which defined amounts of S. aureus  had first been  applied  (1x105 CFU/cm2). A significant decrease in survival of S. aureus  
was seen after a single application of S. hominis  A9 at a final application density consistent with estimates of the density 
of bacteria on normal human skin (1×105 CFU/cm2) (Fig ure 1.3c, a). A similar density of S. hominis  A9 that were killed and 
rinsed prior to application, or use of multiple S. hominis  isolates that did not show antimicrobial activity in culture  (C4, 
C5 and C6 strains)  did not affect S. aureus  survival.  Similarly, a single application of active S. hominis  A9 to mice dorsal 
skin on which defined amounts of S. aureus  had been applied  (1×105 CFU/cm2) reduced the survival of S. aureus  on the 
skin (Fig ure 1.3c, b). In contrast, application of inactive strains  (C4, C5, and C6 strains)  at the similar density did not show 
this activity.  
We have also published additional evidence that this approach can be succ essful using another beneficial S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_694803] ( Cogen et al., 2010a; Cogen et al., 2010b ). In these studies , we demonstrated that application of 
these bacteria to human fingertips will inhibit > 99.9% survival of GAS , and application of only nanomoles of the purified 
AMP  will inhibit growth of GAS abundance on the forearm of volunteer participant s with a p value of < 0.001. Thus, we 
have strong preliminary evidence in animals and on normal human skin that only a single application of a single 
antimicrobial will be effective to inhibit S. aureus.  
Our approach will build on this preliminary data by [CONTACT_134963] a strategy similar to what we have observed in normal skin. 
Multiple antimicrobial strains of commensal bacteria are present at the same time. We have chosen one strain based on 

Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  [ADDRESS_942629] vital 
new information on the interactions of the microbiome with AD patients , to better understand the mechanistic factors 
that influence the stability and effects of the microbiome, and evaluate a potential therapeutic intervention that may be 
a major modifier of clinical outcome.  
1.4. Clinical Studies  
In order t o further examine if topi[INVESTIGATOR_694804] S. aureus  survival on the skin of AD 
participant s, a preliminary double -blind, plac ebo-controlled AMT  study was conducted under IND# [ZIP_CODE]  (IND Sponsor: 
UCSD) . An antimicrobial CoNS strain was isolated from the non-lesional skin of each of 5 AD participant s who were S. 
aureus  culture positive. To transiently increase their abundance on each  participant , the active strain (s) were expanded 
and then reapplied to the lesional forearm skin of the same participant , from which the active colonies were isolated  
(Table 1.1) , to a final concentration of 1×105 CFU/cm2, a density similar to previous  assessments of the abundance of 
bacteria on normal human skin. A single application of th e functionally defined and autologously -derived CoNS strain(s) 
decreased S. aureus  CFU within 24 h ours; whereas , vehicle applied to the contralateral arm in a double -blind 
comparison did not (Fig ure 1.4, a-b). However, CoNS survival on the arm [ADDRESS_942630] that a single application of CoNS at a dose of 1×105 CFU/cm2 was sufficient to 
transiently decrease survival of S. aureus , but the majority of transplanted CoNS died within 24 hou rs. Autologous 
derived S. hominis  A9 (AMT)  did not survive beyond 24 hours on AD  lesional skin ; it is unknown how long S. hominis  A9 
as applied in the allogeneic TMT product will remain alive and active on lesional or non-lesional AD skin. Therefore, we 
propose to apply the allogeneic TMT  at a final concentration of bacteria that ranges from 1 x 106 CFU of bacteria/ gram 
Vegetable glycerin -Cetaphil® to 2 x 109 CFU of bacteria/ gram Vegetable glycerin -Cetaphil® , and for multiple applications 
(twice a day  for 1 week ) for better survival of transplanted CoNS.   
Figure 1.4. Transplantation of antimicrobial CoNS reduces survival of S. aureus  colonized on the skin surface  (The 
manuscript including this data has not yet been published . 
 
Figure 1.4 panel  (a) demonstrates the effect of transplantation of antimicrobial CoNS strain(s) on survival of S. aureus  on 
the skin surface of participant s with AD . S. aureus  survival was measured on the lesional sites in both antecubital fossa 
of the AD participant  before and 24 h ours  after either treatment with antimicrobial CoNS strain(s) autologously 
screened from the same participant  or vehicle. Panel (b) illustrates  S. aureus  survival on the forearm 24 h ours  after 
treatment with autologous strain(s) of CoNS or treatment with vehicle.  Relative CFU (rCFU) of S. aureus  is shown as 

Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  23 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  percent  of baseline  and d ifferent color symbols indicate data from each indi vidual participant . In panel (c)  CFUs of CoN S 
on the skin surface of participant s with AD were simultaneously counted as shown in panel (a).  Panel (d) shows CoNS 
survival on the forearm 24 h ours  after treatment with autologous strain(s) of CoNS or treatmen t with vehicle.  Relative 
CFU of CoNS is shown as percent of baseline.  
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 5 participant s evaluating an AMT lotion  (IND#[ZIP_CODE]), no serious adverse events  (SAEs) were noted . 
Two participant s noted mild worsening of AD, which was deemed unrelated to the AMT lotion , given AMT was not 
applied on the area with worsening AD. One  participant  noted mild worsening of AD with an increase in pruritus and 
erythema on both arms. Since AMT was applied to only one arm, it is less likely that t he adverse event (AE)  was related 
to the AMT given the bilateral worsening of AD on the upper extremities.  Overall, the AMT was  very well tolerated and 
had no significant AEs . 
2. Study Hypotheses/ Objectives  
2.1. Hypotheses  
We propose an interventional clinical trial that will apply S. hominis  A9 to S. aureus  colonized skin of participants with 
moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis . S. hominis  A9 is a specific strain of bacteria commonly found on normal human 
skin but deficient in patients with AD. This strain has be en selected based on its capacity to kill S. aureus in pre -clinical 
models.  
Our central hypothesis is that this intervention will be safe and well tolerated by [CONTACT_694864]. Furthermore, we 
hypothesize that the reintroduction of this commensal mic robe to the skin of AD participant s will decrease colonization 
of S. aureus .  
Testing th ese hypothes es will allow us to proceed with development of an intervention that will successfully treat S. 
aureus  colonization in  clinical patients with AD and eliminate the negative consequences caused by S. aureus  on the 
health of skin.  
2.2. Primary Objective  
The pr imary objective of this trial is to assess the safety  profile  of [ADDRESS_942631] of 1 week of TMT application to placebo application  for up to 4 days after completion of 1 
week of treatment on abundance of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) separately on lesional and non -
lesional skin by [CONTACT_694865] ( qPCR) of the following:  
a. Combined S. homini s 
b. Combined Staphylococci  
c. Combined bacteria  
 
2.4. Exploratory Objective  
1. To identify the diversity of the lesional and non -lesional skin microbiome by [CONTACT_694846] 
[ADDRESS_942632] in man, randomized, double -blind plac ebo controlled multi -site trial designed to assess the safety, 
efficacy , and  steady -state of  allogeneic  TMT  in adults with moderate -to-severe AD. Approximately 54 adult AD 
participant s, 18 to 80 years of age, will complete 1 week of TMT  or placebo applications to  non-lesional and S . aureus  
colonized lesional  skin on the right and left ventral upper extremities (wrist to upper arm ). Participant s who withdraw  or 
are discontinued  from the study before completing the End of Treatment (Day 7) Visit will be replaced.  
During the Screening Visit, participant s will provide informed consent for study participation . Consented participant s will 
then be further assesse d for study eligibility  through the collection of medical history, including medication /therapy  use, 
a physical exam, assessment of AD severity, and swab collection for S . aureus  screening.  Participant s who require a 
washout p eriod of more than 14 days will be required to  return to clinic for a repeat Staph culture.   
Participant s who are eligible based on their positive Staph culture results  will be randomized 2:[ADDRESS_942633] 15 cm2 and one non -lesional site  of equal size  will be identified  on the participant’s 
ventral upper extremities as the target swabbing areas . These sites will be  photographed and marked for swabbing for 
reference  at the participant’s future visits . Participants  will be  instructed to apply investigational product with gloved 
hands to their ventral upper extremities bilaterally from the wrist to the upper arm , which will include  the identified 
lesional and non -lesional swabbing sites  twice a day for [ADDRESS_942634] and empty packets will be returned during the Day 4 and Day 7 visit s. Two  additi onal clinic visits on Day s 
8 and 11  will be scheduled for additional skin swabs to assess safety  and the abundance  of CoNS bacteria and  S. aureus  
colonization . Participant s will be followed through Day 38 to assess for safety and disease status.  
Approximately 54 moderate -to-sever e AD participant s with a positive S . aureus colonized lesion on the upper 
extremities  will be enrolled  for this  trial. Based on preliminary data from the ADRN Registry protocol, we estimate that 
approximately 40% of AD par ticipant s will be S. aureus  positive on their lesional skin , and we may need to screen up to

Unblinding the study due to  an approved int erim analysis, final analysis, or study termination will require written 
approval from NIAID.  
4. Selection of Participants and Clinical Sites/Laboratories  
4.1. Rationale for Study Population 
In AD, a state of microbial imbalance known as dysbiosis occurs and is closely associated with disease severity. An 
important characteristic of the dysbiosis in AD is an increased abundance of S. aureus and a decrease in overall bacterial 
diversity. Several lines of experimental evidence support the concept that the multiple defects in epi[INVESTIGATOR_694805].  
These characteristics , dysb iosis and immunological disorder,  make AD patients most suitable for the transp lant of 
beneficial skin microbiome species to help regulate the imbalance.  AD patients will also be used as the control 
population. This study will be limited to adult moderate- to-severe AD participants , ages 18 -80 years . 
4.2. Inclusion Criteria  
Individuals who  meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment as study participant s:

9. Participant s with a history of psychiatric disease or history of alcohol or drug abuse that would interfere with the 
ability to comply with the study protoc ol 
10. Past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory testing that are not listed 
above, which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may 
interfere with the particip ant’s ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or 
interpretation of the data obtained from the study  
11. Ongoing participation in another investigational trial or use of investigational drugs within 8 weeks, or 5 half -
lives (if known), whichever is longer , of the Screening Visit  
12. Treatment with biologics within [ADDRESS_942645] s (e.g. spouses, children, or members in the same household) that have severe 
barrier defects or are immunocompr omised  
14. Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (including steroids and calcineurin inhibitors) AD treatments within  7 days of the Treatment 
Initiation Visit; Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_694806], per investigator discretion  
15. Treatment of AD with prescription moisturizers classified as medical device ( e.g., Atopi[INVESTIGATOR_12436]®, MimyX®,

19. Any phototherapy for skin disease (such as narrow band ultraviolet B [NBUVB], ultraviolet B [UVB], ultraviolet A1 
[UVA1], psoralen + UVA [PUVA])  or regular use (more than 2 visits per week) of a tanning  bed within [ADDRESS_942647] dermatitis to Vegetable glycerin  or Cetaphil®  lotion are also possible both with the TMT 
product and the placebo.  Participants will be instructed to avoid applying lotion to mucosal surfaces such as the 
conjunctiva. If applied to mucosal surfaces, there may be a higher risk of irritation or infection . We will also avoid 
applying the investigational product ( IP) to the hand since the hand would be a likely source of spreading these bacteria 
onto other surfaces that other people may contact.  Disposable nitrile gloves  will be provided to participants to use 
during application of the allogeneic TMT or placebo. Participants with close contacts (e.g. spouses, children, or members 
in the same household) that have severe barrier defects or are immunocompromised will be excluded from 
participating, per study ex clusion criteria.  
Should an infection occur, the participant  would be treated according to standard treatment including antibiotics (for 
infection) and ointment (for irritation and dryness ). Refer to Section 7.[ADDRESS_942648] allergic reactions to Cetaphil ® lotion or Vegetable glycerin  will be treated with mid -potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_694807] 0.05%.   
5.2. Risks of Investigational Product or Intervention cited in Medical Literature  
Not Applicable  
5.3. Risks of Other Protocol Specified Medications  
In the event of infection, the elected rescue treatment will follow guidelines specified in Section 7.4 . There is theoretical 
risk associated with the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_694808] a rescue medication. Specific risks will vary between treatments. In general risks of  antibiotics are hypersensitivity, urticari a, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sun sensitivity, 
anaphylaxis,  and death.  
5.4. Risks of Study Procedures  
5.4.1.  Risks Associated with S toppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] t he Use of Protocol Prohibited Medications /Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_694809] -prohibited medications /therapi[INVESTIGATOR_694810]. In an effort to minimize these 
risks, participant s with severe AD who may have difficulty tolerating periods without 
medication /therapy  use will be excluded from participating , per study exclusion criteria.  
5.4.2.  Risks A ssociated with Skin Swab Collection  
There are no significant risks associated with skin swab colle ction.  
5.4.3.  Risks Associated with Physical Exam  
There are no known risks associated with the physical exam.  
5.4.4.  Risks associated with Questionnaires  
There is a possibility that participant s may find questions too personal. Participant s may refuse to 
answer any que stions that make them feel uncomfortable. There is also a possibility that a participant ’s 
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  31 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  answers may be read by [CONTACT_2312] ; however , participant s’ records are carefully protected so this is very 
unlikely. S ee section 16. 4 for more information on confidentiality.  
5.4.5.  Risks associated with Blood Collection  
Risks associated with drawing blood include possible pain when the needle is inserted, as well as 
bleeding, bruising and/or infection at the puncture site.  Some people may experience lightheadedness, 
nausea, or fainting.  A numbing agent may be placed on the skin before the blood draw to reduce the 
pain of the stick. Side effects from this cream (mainly skin rash) may occur. There is a potential for slight 
psychological stress from the procedure.  If psychological stress is too much in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_694811]/nurse the procedures will be halted.  National Institutes of Health ( NIH) 
guidelines for blood collection (amount and frequency based on age) will be followed.  
5.5. Potential Benefits  
There may or may no t be any direct benefits for the participant s who elect to enroll in this study . One potential benefit 
is that the investigational product  may improve the participant ’s AD; however, there is no guarantee that the product  
will help the p articipan t’s condition.  The participant ’s skin condition may even get worse by [CONTACT_694868]/her 
previous/regular AD treatment, or the participant  could be in the  placebo  group and not receive active treatment, in 
which case his/her AD  may also flare.  
The resu lts of this study  may also provide identification and/or validation of new targets for the future development of 
therapeutics for participant s with AD , as well as increase current knowledge on the ability to transform the cutaneous 
microbiome, which could lead to potential therapeutic strategies for treating a variety of inflammatory skin conditions.  
6. Investigational Agent   
6.1. Investigational Agent  
6.1.1.  Targeted Microbiome Transplant  Lotion (TMT)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling  
The allogeneic TMT product will b e manufactured and packaged at UCSD.  The UCSD Manufacturing Lab  has 
isolated Staphylococcus  hominis  strain A9 from the skin surface of a healthy donor.  This S. hominis  A9 strain 
produces potent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus . UCSD has characteriz ed antimicrobial peptides 
produced by [CONTACT_694869], protein sequencing,  and genomic sequencing approaches.  
The UCSD Manufacturing Lab will establish the  Master Cell Bank (MCB) of the S. hominis  A9 strain , and it  will 
be stored in a  locked  -80oC freezer at UCSD.  The Working Cell Bank (WCB) will be prepared from a single 
colony  of the MCB and stored in a locked - 80oC freezer  at UCSD . 
 
Each batch of the allogeneic TMT product will be prepared from a single -use vial from the WCB.  A vial of the 
S. hominis  A9 from the W CB will be thawed and cultured in animal -free tryptic soy broth ( TSB) media at 37°C 
to expand the number of S. hominis A9. Bacterial concentration will be assessed, after culturing, by [CONTACT_349802] 600. 
The cultured bacteria  will then be washed twice with  an equal volume of  normal saline (NS ) to remove the 
animal- free TSB. Based on pre -clinical data, proteins are undetectable in the supernatant after the second 
wash. Bacterial density  of the resuspension will be measured by [CONTACT_349802]600. 
 
Washed bacteria will be sterilely mixed in 50% Cetaphil®  lotion and 50% Vegetable glycerin  using a sterile 
bowl and sterile spatula.  Each batch wi ll be  assigned a unique lot number and will undergo  a visual test for 
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  [ADDRESS_942649] ing in accordance with U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention ( USP) <61> and  
<62> testing , potency testing by [CONTACT_694870], and identity 
testing by  [CONTACT_940] ( PCR) for the hogocidin gene . Two gram aliquots of final allogeneic 
TMT product will be transferred into sterile heat -sealing pouch es with a sterile dispenser  under the sterile 
hood.  The packet will be sealed with a heat -sealer.  Twenty -two single -use p ackets will be grouped in boxes 
and labeled  with the lot number and box ID. Pre -labeled boxes will be provided to the UCSD Manufacturing 
Lab by [CONTACT_694871]. Packaged boxes will be stored in a -80°C freezer at UCSD until shipment to clinical sites. 
After packaging, one percent of single -use packets will  be selected and potential pathogens will be screened 
for Microbial Limits  Testing in accordance with USP <61> and <62> testing , visual appearance testing, and 
also undergo  potency testing by [CONTACT_694870], an d identity 
testing by [CONTACT_694872] . The final TMT product will be formulated at a S. hominis  A9 
concentration range from  1 x 106 CFU of bacteria/gram Vegetable glycerin -Cetaphil® to 2  x 109 CFU of 
bacteria/gram Vegetable glycerin -Cetaphil®  
Potency testing will be performed by [CONTACT_694873].  
Potency of TMT is acceptable if [ADDRESS_942650] show  S. 
aureus  inhibition zones greater than 1 mm in diam eter. Bacterial  concentration of the TMT will be checked 
by [CONTACT_14391] a known quantity of the TMT on an agar plate and incubating the plate overnight at 37 ̊ C. The  
number of viable colonies will be counted the following day . All colonies  will be checked to ensure they  
show the same morphology.  Only TMT that has a final concentration of bacteria that ranges from 1 x 
106 CFU of bacteria/gram Vegetable glycerin -Cetaphil® to 2 x 109 CFU of bacteria/gram Vegetable glycerin -
Cetaphil® will be used in the clinical t rial.  
Identity testing will be confirmed by [CONTACT_694874] - α gene  by [CONTACT_954] .  
Any TMT that does  not meet these  requirements will be discarded as per UCSD’s hazardous waste protocol.   
[IP_ADDRESS].   Dosage, Preparation, and Administration 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Dosage  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1.  Targeted Density of Transplanted CoNS  
There is considerable variability in the abundance of CoNS bacteria on human skin. A recent 
unpublished study by [CONTACT_694875] a range of abundance bet ween 1 x102 CFU/cm2 and 1 x107CFU/cm2. No deleterious 
effects were observed in participants  colonized at this density, but p articipant s with this range of 
antimicrobial CoNS abundance were not colonized by S. aureus . Therefore, the application of CoNS 
in a lotion  formulation to a final density of as  low as 102 CFU/cm2 can be predicted to be effective at 
inhibiting S. aureus , and a density as high as 1 x 10 7CFU/cm2 is within the density typi[INVESTIGATOR_694812].  
Using the body surface area calculations of Mosteller ( Mosteller 1987 ), we estimate that the 
smallest potential participant  of 4’10” and [ADDRESS_942651] participant  of 
6’3” and 210 pounds has a BSA  of 2.25 m2. Using the R ule of Nines , each arm is estimated as 9% of 
the total  BSA.  Therefore, the ventral surface would be 4.5%  of the total BSA . Since one hand is 1%  of 
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  33 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  BSA, the ventral surface  of one arm  not including the hand would be 3.5% of BSA.  Thus  the smallest 
participant  has an area on their ventral arm of [ADDRESS_942652] participant  787 cm2.  
We seek to achieve a final concentration of 1x 105 CFU/cm2 of transplanted bacteria on the skin  
which mimics the concentration on normal skin . To achieve this, the investigational  product will be 
formulated at a final concentration of bacteria that ranges from 1 x 106 CFU of bacteria/gram 
Vegetable glycerin -Cetaphil® to 2 x 109 CFU of bacteria/gram V egetable glycerin -Cetaphil® , and a 
total mass  of [ADDRESS_942653] will be  applied to each  participant’s  arm twice a day . The acceptable 
dosage range will be between 2 x 103 CFU/cm2 and 1 x 107 CFU/cm2 to account for variability in 
participan t surface area, bacteria survival, and loss of product during application. This range is 
within the predicted effective and safe concentration of 102 CFU/cm2 to 107 CFU/cm2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Preparation 
Boxed TMT packets , 22 packets per box,  will be shipped to clinical sites on dry ice  and stored at - 80°C

6.2. Investigational  Product s Accountability  
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62 ), the investigator will  maintain adequate records of 
the disposition of the investigational product s, including the date and quantity of the  product received, to whom the 
product was dispensed ( participant -by-participant  accounting), and a  detailed accounting of any product  accidentally or 
deliberately destroyed.  Details of investigational product dispensation to each participat ing site will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_694876].  
Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maint ained by [CONTACT_3452].  A product -dispensing log will be 
kept current for each  participant . This log will contain the  study  identification number of each participant  and the date 
and quantity of product  dispensed.  
All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection.  At the termination of 
the study, all u nused product will be destroyed . For more information on handling of the investigational product please 
refer to the  manual of procedures  (MOP ).  
6.3. Assessment of Participant  Compliance with Investigational Agent  
Each clinical site will keep an inventory of TMT  and placebo  packets with information on date of original preparation, 
and date received on site. Participant s will be required to return all packets of product dispensed, used or unused . Study 
staff will record the  count of opened , unopened , and missing packets.  A reconciliat ion of recorded data per box, prior to 
dispensation and after , will be used to assess compliance. In addition, participants will record completed and missed 
applications in their participant diary.  
6.4. Toxicity Prevention and Management  
All steps will be take n to minimize potential risks of the study. Participant s with known sensitivities/allergies to any of 
the products used during this study  will be excluded from enrollment and study participation . Participant s with any 
cracks or breaks in their skin, includ ing severely excoriated or bleeding skin suggesting that the participant  may be 
susceptible to an  infection will be excluded. Similarly, participant s with prosthetic or implanted devices will also be 
excluded. Any  AE, defined as any undesirable sign, sympt om, or medical condition occurring after the participant ’s

9. Sample Collection  and Assays  
This section describes the proposed methodologies for this study. The techniques are state- of-the-art at the time of the 
writing of this protocol. Even so, the techniques will be updated and/or changed should there be additional technical 
breakthroughs in this area of research. Details of the laboratory processes are described in Standard Operating 
Procedures (SO Ps) maintained by [CONTACT_109153].  
9.1. Skin Swab Samples  
9.1.1.  Skin Swab Collection Procedure  
The most severe lesion measuring at least [ADDRESS_942667] 15 cm2. The designated  lesional and non -
lesional sites for swabbing will be marked with a pen and non -identifying digital photographs will be take n for 
reference during future visits.  The designated sites for swabbing will be measured  for each participant  and the 
total  lesional and non -lesional area (cm x cm) recorded.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_942668] 30 seconds.  If sampling 
area allows, u p to 6 additional swabs  may  be obtained from each  participant, 3 additional  swabs from the 
lesional and non -lesional each.  A maximum of 12 swabs may be obtained from each participant.  
9.1.2.  Staphylococcus aureu s Screening Assay  
Skin swabs will be collected from pre -measured area s of lesional and non -lesional skin per Section 9.1.1 . Swabs 
will then be used to inoculate blood agar plates (5% sheep blood; No. R01202;  Remel Inc.; Lenexa, Kansas) . A 
Spectra MRSA agar plate (Remel Spectra MRSA Screen plate; No. R01821;  Remel Inc. ) will also be swabbed for 
qualitative evaluation only . Blood agar p lates will be incubated up to 48 h ours in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37◦ C. 
Colonies appearing to be Staphylococcus aureus  on the blood agar will be tested for coagulase and catalase. If 
the tests are positive, the colonies will be identified as  Staphylococcus aureus species. Positive plates will be 
scored from 1 -4 based on the number of quadrants with S. aureus  growth. The MRSA plat es will be incubated up 
to 24 hours in a non -CO 2 incubator at 35 °C. Any colonies growing on the Spectra MRSA plate after 24 hours will 
be identified as MRSA.

Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  9.1.3.  CFU Quantification of Live Staphylococcus aureus  and CoNS  
Skin swabs will be collected from pre -measured area s of lesional and non -lesional skin per Section 9.1.1 . Swabs 
will be suspended in 1.5  mL TSB containing 15% (v/v) USP -grade  glycerin  and stored frozen at - 80°C. Live CFUs of 
coagulase positive S. aureus  will be determined by [CONTACT_694892] a bacterial culture plate containing mannitol salt agar with egg yolk for selective growth of 
Staphylococcus spp . S. aureus  will be  conventionally distinguished f rom CoNS  according to mannitol metabolism 
and the egg yolk reaction , and coagulase positive and negative Staphylococcus will be quantified by [CONTACT_694893] .  
Lesional and non-lesional s kin swabs will be  separat ely analyzed in batches  consisting of all applicable swabs 
available for a pre -selected minimum number of participants after all selected participants have either 
completed the Day [ADDRESS_942669] bacterial DNA, pre -measur ed areas adjacent  to those used for bacterial culture  will be rubbed with a 
swab pre -moistened with Tris -EDTA buffer containing 0.1% TritonX -100 and 0.05% Tween -20 (w/v) . Bacterial-
genomic DNA will be extracted for qPCR  with the QIAamp DNA Micro kit (QIAGEN: [ZIP_CODE]).  DNA will be eluted 
with 25  µL elution buffer . One µL of the elution will be used for qPCR using universal 16S  rRNA primers and 
species - or genus -specific primers.  For quantification of S. aureus  and S. homini s DNA , DNA extracted from  an 
authentic number of each bacterium  (S. aureus  ATCC35556 and S. hominis  ATCC27845, respectively)  will be used 
for standard curve s. For quantification of combined staphylococci DNA, a standard curve from an authentic  
number of S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_694830]12228 will be used.  The standard curve will be used for determination of absolute 
number of bacteria (as rCFU/ µL). This known amount of bacteria for S. aureus  and S. hominis  will range from 1x 
101 to 1x106 CFU/ µL. For total 16S rRNA quantification, relative abundance will be calculated with the Delta-
Delta -Ct method.   
 
Lesional and non -lesional skin swabs will be analyzed in batches consisting of all applicable swabs available for a 
pre-selected minimum number of participants  after all selected  participants have either completed the D ay 38 
Visit or  terminated early from the study.  In order to help maintain the blind throughout the process of sample 
analysis, swabs in each batch will be relabeled and processed in random  order so that swabs from a single 
participant are not analyzed in sequence. To help ensure the random order and to maintain  the blind within the 
lab, a separate technician will arrange the samples for processing and assay the samples.  
9.1.5.  Analysis of Mic robial P opulati ons by 16S rRNA S equencing  
V1-V3 16S rRNA gene will be amplified with Phusion High -Fidelity polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) 
using dual -indexed coded primers, normalized, pooled and paired -end sequenced (2 × 300bp) on an Illumina 
MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA).  The 16S rRNA bacterial sequence reads will be assessed for quality and analyzed 
using phylogenetic and Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) methods in the Quantitative Insights into Microbial 
Ecology (QIIME) software, version 1 .9.1.  Read pairs will be assembled using fastq -join from the ea- utils package 
(http://code.google.com/p/ea -utils), requiring at least 20 bases of overlap and allowing a maximum of 10% 
mismatched bases. OTUs will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_694831]- based USEARCH (version 5.2) pi[INVESTIGATOR_694832], 
using the May 2013 release of the GreenGenes 99% OTU database. OTU clusters with less than four sequences

Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  Information in this section complies with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety 
Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E -6: Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice  (GCP) , 21CFR Parts 312 and 320, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
12.2 Definitions  
12.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the participant ’s participation in the research, 
whether or not considered related to the participant ’s participation in the research (modified from the 
definition of AEs in the 2018  ICH E-6 Guideline s for Good Clinical Practice) (from  Office of Human Research 
Protections  (OHRP ) "Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects 
or Other s and Adverse Events (1/15/07)"  http://www. hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2  )  
For this study, an AE  will include any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with:   
• TMT  or Placebo  regimen:  An AE occurring from the time of consent and within one month  after 
the last study -mandat ed TMT or placebo  application  
• Study mandated procedures :  
o Blood Draw  
The following events related to the blood draw procedure will be considered an AE if they 
occur within 48 hours of the blood draw:  
o Fainting / Vasovagal Events  
o Bruising at the puncture site larger than 2 cm in diameter  
o Bleeding from the puncture site lasting more than 30 minutes  
o Swelling at puncture site larger than 2 cm  
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational study product  regimen  caused 
the AE. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest 
a causal relationship between the product and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
12.2.2 Unexpected Adverse Event   
An AE or SAR is considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in the I nvestigator  Brochure  or is not listed at the 
specificity, severity,  or rate of occurrence that has been observed.  
12.2.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the DAIT/NIAID  Medical Monitor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)):  
1. Death.  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life -thre atening” if, in the vie w of either the 
investigator or the DAIT/NIAID  Medical Monitor, its occurrence places the participant  at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  [ADDRESS_942673].  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate m edical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_694835].  
12.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
12.3.1 Grading Criteria  
The study site will grade the severity of AEs  experienced by [CONTACT_87755] s according to the criteria set 
forth in the NCI -CTCAE  Version 4.0 3. This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a 
common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical 
significance of all AEs . The NCI -CTCAE has been reviewed by [CONTACT_694896].   
AEs will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the follo wing standards in the NCI -CTCAE manual:  
Grade 1 = mild AE  
Grade 2 = moderate AE  
Grade 3 = severe and undesirable AE  
Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling AE 
Grade 5 = death  
Events grade 1 or higher will be recorded on the appropriate AE electronic case report form  (eCRF ) for this 
study.  
For grading an abnormal value or result of a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but not limited to, a 
radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram  etc.), a treatment- emergent AE is define d as an increase in 
grade from b aseline or from the last p ost-baseline value that doesn’t meet grading criteria. Chan ges in grade 
from screening to  pre-treatment and  enrollment  at Day 0 will also be recorded as AEs, but are not treatment -
emergent. If a specific event or result from a given clinical or laboratory evaluation is not included in the NCI -
CTCAE manual, then an abnormal result would be considered an AE  if changes in therapy or monitoring are 
implemented  as a result of the event/result . 
For additional information and a printable version of the NCI -CTCAE manual, consult the NCI -CTCAE web 
site: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
12.3.[ADDRESS_942674]  regimen or study procedure(s) will 
initially be determined by [CONTACT_694897].  Final determination of 
attribution for safety reporting will be determined by [CONTACT_80964]/NIAID  Medical Monitor.  The relationship of an AE  
to study therapy regimen or procedures will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided in 
Table 12 .3.2.

12.4 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
12.4.1 Collection Period  
AEs will be collected from the time of consent  until a participant  completes study participation or until 30 days 
after he/she prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the study.  
12.4.2 Collecting Adverse Events  
AEs (includi ng SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods:  
• Observing the participant . 
• Interviewing  the participant  in an objective manner [e.g., using structured questioning] . 
• Reviewing the participant diary.  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant . 
• Receiving a call from the participant outside of their regular study visits; instructions for contact[CONTACT_694898] a n instructional  hand card at the Treatment Initiation Visit , as well as in the participant 
diary.  
• In addit ion, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE , as 
defined in Section [ADDRESS_942675] AEs and SAEs  as described previously (Section 12.2 ) on the 
appropriate AE/SAE eCRF  regardless of the relationship to study therapy regimen or study procedure.  
Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae , or the AE /SAE  stabilizes , or 
until the end of study parti cipation, or until 30 days after the participant  prematurely withdraws (without 
withdrawing consent)/or is withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs first.  
12.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  and Adverse Events  
12.5.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to DAIT/NIAID   
This section describes the responsibilities of the site investigator to report SAEs  to the sponsor and the SACCC

12.5.2 Reporting to Health Authority  
After an AE , requiring 24 hour reporting  (per Section 12.5.1), is submitted by [CONTACT_694899]/NIAID,  there are two options for  DAIT/NIAID  to report the AE  to the appropriate health authorities:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Annual Reporting  
DAIT/NIAID  will include in the IND A nnual Report to the FDA all reported AEs classified as:   
o Serious, expected, suspected adverse reactions (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section 12.2.2).  
o Serious and  not a suspected adverse reaction (see Section 12.2.2).  
o Pregnancies .  
Note that all AEs (not just those requiring 24 -hour reporting) will be reported in the IND Annual Report  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Safety Reporting  
This option, with 2 possible categories, app lies if the AE is classified as one of the following:  
Category 1 : Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R]  (see Section 12 .2.1.1 , Section 
12.2 , and 21 CFR 312.32(c ) (1) i).  
The sponsor shall report any SAR  that is both serious and unexpected.  The sponsor shall report 
an AE as a SAR  only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
investigational product  and the AE , such as:  
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  [ADDRESS_942678] exposure (e.g.  sepsis, cellulitis or deep tissue infections ); 
2. One or more occu rrences of an event that is not commonly associated with 
investigational product exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population 
exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or conditi on under investigation or other events 
that commonly occur in the study population independent of investigational product  
regimen ) that indicates those events occ ur more frequently in the investigational 
product  treatment group than in a concurrent or hist orical control group.  
  
Category 2 : Any fin dings from studies that suggest  a significant human risk   
 
The sponsor shall report any findin gs from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], analyses of AEs  within 
the current study or pooled analysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro  testing (e.g. 
mutagenicity, teratogenicity, ca rcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in humans  exposed 
to th e investigational product  that would result in a safety -related change in the protocol, 
informed c onsent, investigato r brochure or package insert or  other a spects of the overall 
conduct of the study.   
DAIT/NIAID  shall notify the FDA and all participating investigators of expedited Safety Reports within 15 
calendar days; unexpected fatal or immediately life -threatening suspected adverse reaction(s) shall be 
reported as soon as possible or within 7 calendar days.  
12.5.3 Reporting of Adverse Events to the Central IRB  
All investigators shall report AEs, including expedited reports, in a timely fashion to the ir local and central 
IRB in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines . All Safety Reports to the FDA  shall be

discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the  possible effects on  the fetus. Monitoring of the 
pregnant participant  or partner of the male participant  shall continue until the conclusion of the  pregnancy.    
The investigator shall report to the SACCC  all pregnancies within 1 business day of becoming aware of the event 
using the Pregnancy eCRF.  The SACCC will report all pregnancies to DAIT/NIAID. All pregnancies identified during 
the study shall be followed to conclusion and the outcome of each must be reported.  The Pregnancy eCRF  shall 
be updated and submitted to the SACCC  when details about the outcome ar e available.   
Information requested about the delivery shall include:  
o Gestational age at delivery  
o Birth weight, length, and head circumference  
o Gender

Stratified block randomization will be performed centrally at the SACCC , and will balance baseline  S. aureus  abundance  
(low vs high)  between treatment arms  by [CONTACT_68566]. Clinical staff, laboratory personnel analyzing samples,  and study 
participant s will be blinded to treatment arm. Laboratory personnel analyzing samples will remain blinded as described 
in Section 3.5.  
13.4 Analysis Plan  
13.4.1 Analysis Samples  
• Safety Sample  
o The safety sample will include all participant s who are randomized and receive an y amount of 
TMT/ placebo . 
• Modified Intent -to-Treat (MITT) Sample  
o The Modified Intent -to-Treat sample will include all participant s who are randomized, provide  skin 
swabs on Days 0 and 7 and administer 75% of doses of TMT/placebo . The MITT sample will not 
exclude participant s with lesional CFU=0 at the Treatment Initiation Visit.  
• Per-Protocol  (PP) Sample  
o The per -protocol sample will include all M ITT participant s who commit no major protocol deviations . 
The PP sample will not exclude participant s with lesional CFU=0 at the Treatment Initiation Visit.  
o Additional PP samples will be defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
• Interim Analysis Sample  
o The Interim Analysis sample will include all participant s who meet the following criteria:  
 Are randomized  
 Administer at least 75% of doses of TMT/placebo  
 Provide skin swabs  with analyzable results  at each of the  Days 0, 7 and  11 visit s 
 Complete the Day 38 visit on or prior to the  time of the interim analysis, which will be on or 
after the  date when both of the following criteria are satisfied: 1) 10 participants given 
active TMT application complete the Day 38 visit  and meet the 3 criter ia above  and 2)  [ADDRESS_942687] error, 
as appropriate, adjusting for site  and S. aureus  growth stratum at S creening.  Zero -inflated negative binomial or 
Poisson models will be considered if a large number of participants experience no AEs throughout the study.  
Analyses will be performed on the Safety S ample within the TMT treatment arm and the placebo arm  
separately . 
As this is a Phase 1 study, the primary endpoint is descriptive, and comparisons between TMT and placebo arms 
will be done as secondary analyses.  All analyses will be used to inform future studies.  
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  55 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  13.4.3 Supportive Analyses of the Primary Endpoint   
Similar analyses as those described above will be performed as sensitivity analyses, adjusting for cov ariates 
found to be relevant and unbalanced between treatment arms  (e.g. severity measures , age, gender, etc.).  
Further sensitivity analyses will be performed similarly on the  MITT and  PP sample s and on additional PP 
samples defined in the SAP . 
13.4.[ADDRESS_942688] or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate . 
Analyses of disease severity (e.g. SCORAD, RL, EASI of ventral arms, and Pruritus VAS  of ventral arms ) will be 
conducted using analysis of c ovariance (ANCOVA ) comparing treatment arms  at each applicable visit , adjusting 
for Day [ADDRESS_942689] s of participant and  time will be included in the model.  
Covariates similar to those used in support of the primary endpoint w ill be considered for inclusion in severity 
analyses.  
Secondary analyses comparing bacterial abundance  (e.g.  CoNS , S.  hominis  A9 and S. aureus ) on lesional and  
non-lesional skin between treatment arms  will be performed using ANCOVA on the log 10 transformed 
abundance of bacteria over all applicable timepoints , adjusting for the log 10 (pre-dosing Day 0 bacteria 
abundance ) and  site.  Random effect s of participant and  time will be included in the model. Comparisons will be 
made on the MITT  sample bet ween the TMT treatment arm and the placebo  arm. 
Change from baseline in S. aureus , CoNS  or S. hominis  A9 bacteria abundance comparisons between lesional and 
non-lesional skin  in the applicable  treatment arm  will be analyzed using ANCOVA on the difference in log 10 
transformed abundance over baseline, adjusting for the log 10 (pre-dosing Day 0 bacteria abundance ) and  site. 
Random effect s of participant and  time will be included in the model.   Additional analyses adjusting for the 
abundance at other visits in lieu of pre -dosing Day 0 abundance will be considered and defined in the SAP.  
Analyses of microbiome diversity (e.g. % relative abundance by [CONTACT_694849]: Class  and Shannon Diversity Index ) will 
be conducted using ANCOVA  comparing treatment arms at Day 7, adjusting for Day 0 measure.  Analyses at 
additional time points  may be considered.  Covariates similar to those used in support of the primary endpoint 
will be considered for inclusion in microb iome diversity analyses . 
13.4. 5 Descriptive Analyses  
Descriptive analyses will be reported separately for each treatment arm. Continuous baseline measures will be 
reported  as 1) means (or geometric means) with 95% confidence intervals, or 2) median with 1st and 3rd quartile, 
as appropriate.  Categorical baseline and demographic characteristics  and study disposition  will be reported as 
proportions with 95% exact confidence intervals.   
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  56 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  13.5 Interim Analyses  
13.5.1 Interim Analysis of Efficacy Data  
An interim analysis will be performed based on cumulative efficacy data of all participants  in the Interim Analysis 
sample (see Section 13.4.1).  
The purpose of the interim analysis is to provide critical information  for future studies  regarding the potency  of 
the intervention to decrease S. aureus  CFU as well as detect any tendency of the S. hominis  A9 to accumulate on 
the skin after repeated applications . Skin total staphylococcal  CFU, S. aureus  CFU, qPCR o f total DNA abundance 
of staphylococci, S. aureus  specific DNA , hogocidin lantibiotic and total S. hominis  DNA  will be analyzed as part 
of the interim analysis . Clinical endpoints  of disease severity (EASI, SCORAD, pruritus  VAS and RL score) will also 
be analyzed . 
The interim analysis will support our primary endpoint of safety to determine if there is an accumulation of 
bacteria during the course of treatment or if there is an increase in clinical disease severity.  The interim analysis 
will also inform secondary endpoints regarding the ability of the mic robiome transplant to decrease S. aureus  
survival and total abundance. This information is necessary for d esign of future studies . There will be no 
decisions made regarding  the conduct of this clinical trial (e.g. stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_582413]) based on the 
results of the interim analysis.  Enrollment will not be impacted  or paused while the interim analysis is being 
performed.  
Secondary objectives [ADDRESS_942690] modifications to the protocol based on its review of the findings.  
13.5.3 Futility Analysis  
 No formal interim  analyses are planned for futility.   
13.6 Statistical  Hypotheses  
For the analysis of the primary endpoint,  we hypothesize that the TMT application  taken over the course of 1 week is 
safe for AD participants  with S. aureus  skin colonization . Safety will be  assessed by [CONTACT_694901] -serious  
treatment- emergent AEs per participant  during the time period of Day 0 to  Day 8 . As this is a Phase 1 study, the primary 
endpoint is descriptive, and comparison s between TMT and placebo arms will be done  as secondary analyses . All 
analyses will be used to inform future studies.  
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  57 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  Null hypotheses of secondary analyses are described below.  All corresponding alternative hypotheses are that  there are 
differences between both groups being compared  (i.e. 2 -sided comparisons) . 
1. There is no difference in the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious or non -serious 
treatment- emergent AE during the time period of Day [ADDRESS_942691] one serious or non -serious 
AE between the TMT and placebo arm during study  participation.  
4. There is no difference in the EASI score of the ventral arms between the TMT and placebo arm  at each 
applicable time point (individually).  
5. There is no difference in the SCORAD score between the TMT and placebo arm  at each applicable time 
point (individually).  
6. There is no difference in the Pruritus VAS of the ventral arms between the TMT and placebo arm  at each 
applicable time point (individually).  
7. There is no difference in the RL score between the TMT and placebo arm  at each applicable tim e point 
(individually) . 
8. There is no difference in CoNS bacteria abundance on lesional and non -lesional skin between the TMT 
and placebo a rm at each applicable time point (individually) . 
9. There is no difference in the change from baseline of CoNS bacteria ab undance between  lesional and 
non-lesional skin at each applicable timepoint (individually).  
10. There is no difference in  the change from baseline  of S. hominis  A9 bacteria abundance  between  lesional 
and non -lesional skin  at each applicable timepoint  (individually).  
11. There is no difference in S. aureus  abundance on lesional  and non -lesional skin between the TMT arm 
and the placebo arm  at each applicable time point (individually) . 
12. There is no difference in  the change from baseline  of S. aureus  abundance  between  lesional and non -
lesional skin  at each applicable time point (individually) .  
13. There is no difference in the bacterial DNA abundance on lesional and non -lesional skin between the 
TMT arm and the placebo arm  at each applicable time point (individually) . 
13.7 Sample Size Considerations  
The proposed sample size for this study is 36 participants in the TMT arm and 18 in the placebo arm (2:1 
randomization).  The primary objective of the analysis is to estimate the count of serious and non -serious  treatment -
emergent AEs during the time period of Day 0 to Day 8 per  participant  for participants completing 1 week of TMT 
application and for participants completing 1 week of placebo  application . The proposed sample size allows us to 
determine a safety p rofile of TMT application taken for 1 week, as well as to estimate parameters of secondary 
analyses to power for future efficacy studies.

14. Identification  and Access to Source Data  
14.1. Source Data 
Source documents and source data are considered to be the original documentation where participant  information, visit  
consultations, exami nations and other information  are recorded . Documentation of source data is necessary for the 
reconstruction, evaluation,  and validation of clinical findings, observations and other activities during a clinical trial.   
14.2. Access to Source Data  
The site investigators and site staff will make all source data available to the DAIT/NIAID,  authorized  representatives of 
DAIT/NIAID , as well as to relevant health authorities . Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain 
the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that may be linked to identified individuals.  
15. Protocol Deviations  
15.1. Protocol Deviation  Definitions  
Protocol Deviation  – The investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the protocol; no deviations 
from the protocol are permitted . Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures constitutes 
a protocol deviation . As a result of any deviation, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_48162].  
 
Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violation) -  A Protocol Violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that 
may affect the participant 's rights, safety, or well -being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study 
data . In addition, protocol violations include willful or knowing breach es of human subject protection regulations, or 
policies, any action that is inconsistent with the NIH Human  Research Protection Program’s research, medical, and 
ethical principles , and a serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, local or institutional human subject 
protection regulations, policies, or procedures . Examples of Major Protocol Deviat ions are described in the MOP.  
 
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  [ADDRESS_942692] on the participant 's rights, safety,  or 
well- being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.  
15.2. Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations  
The study site PI [INVESTIGATOR_393241], document and report protocol deviations  as directed by [CONTACT_73884]/ NIAID . 
However, protocol deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during other form s of study conduct 
review.  
Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the study staff will a) notify the site PI, b) notify the SACC C 
and c) will complete a Protocol Deviation form . The protocol deviation form will document at minimum the date the 
deviation occurred, the date it was identified, a description of the event, whether the deviation resulted in an SAE/AE, PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_59844], I RB report requirement, and documentation of a corrective action plan. DAIT/ NIAID may request discussion 
with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_694838]/her further study 
participation, the effect of the p rotocol deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_694839], electronically sign Major Deviations in the  electronic data capture  (EDC) system , and 
submit the deviation to the central IRB, and loc al IRB/EC per IRB regulations.  Major protocol deviations will be reported 
to the DSMB by [CONTACT_80964]/ NIAID Medical Monitor at the medical monitor’s discretion.  
16. Ethical Considerations and Compliance with Good Clinical Practice  
16.1. Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The investigator is required to keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the study is fully documented. The 
investigator is required to ensure that all CRFs are completed for every participant entered in the trial.  
The sponsor is responsi ble for regular inspection of the conduct of the trial, for verifying adherence to the protocol, and 
for confirming the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of all documented data.  
The CRFs will be completed online via a web -based EDC system that has b een validated and is compliant with Part 11 
Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Study staff at the site will enter information into the e CRFs, and the data will 
be stored remotely at a central database. Data quality will be ensured through the EDC  system’s continuous monitoring 
of data and real- time detection and correction of errors. All elements of data entry (i.e., time, date, verbatim text, and 
the name [CONTACT_8066]) will be recorded in an electronic audit trail to allow all changes in the database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal regulations.  
16.2. Statement of Compliance  
This clinical study will be conducted using GCP, as delineated in Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice 
Consolidated G uidance , and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol.  Before study initiation, the protocol 
and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_106505]. Any amendments to the 
protocol or to the consent materials w ill also be approved by [CONTACT_694902].  
16.3. Informed Consent Process  
The consent process will provide information about the study to a prospective participant  and will allow adequate time 
for review and discussion prior to his/her  decision.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_694840] [ADDRESS_942693] demonstrated knowledge of the protocol and study procedures.  The prospective 
Atopic Dermatitis Research Network  Confidential  Page  60 of 64 
Targeted Microbiome Transplant in Atopic Dermatitis    Version 2.0 14 February  2019  participant  will be told that being in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, 
for any reason.  The participant  will read, sign, and date a consent form before undergo ing any study procedures.  
Consent materials will be presented in the participant ’s primary language. A copy of the signed informed consent form 
will be given to the  participant . 
The consent process will be  ongoing. The informed  consent form will be revised  when important new safety information 
is available, the protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes available that may affect participation in the 
study.  
16.4. Privacy and Confidentiality  
Following the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Ac t (HIPA A) guidelines a  participant ’s privacy and 
confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study.  Each participant  will be assigned a unique identification number 
and these numbers rather than names will be used to collect, store, and report participant  information. All biological 
samples will be labeled with the identification number. Data reported in medical journals or scientific meetings will be 
presented in aggregate for participant s as a whole. No individual participant  will be identifie d in any way. Site personnel 
will not transmit documents containing personal health identifiers (PHI) to the study sponsor or their representatives.   
17. Publication Policy  
The ADRN  Publications  Policy will apply  to presentations and publications of the results of  this trial.

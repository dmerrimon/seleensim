compared with placebo  and active control (fentanyl) , in subjects  undergoing painful outpatient and 
office based procedures.  
Secondary objectives of this st udy will include:  
 To evaluate the anxiolytic effects  of DEX -IN  
 To determine the safety and tolerability of DEX -IN as evaluated with  vital sign collection , and 
incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs).  
Methodology:    
This is a Phase  2, randomized, multicenter, double -blind, placebo - and active -controlled evaluation of 
the efficacy and safety of DEX -IN in adult subjects undergoing painful outpatient and office based 
procedures .  The study will enroll up to 250 subjects across  up to 5 stud y cohorts, with approximately 
50-75 subjects per cohort .  Each study cohort will include subjects undergoing a specific  painful 
procedure which may include, but is not limited to, cosmetic procedures (face peel, 
liposuction/liposculpture, sclerotherapy, et c.), dental procedures, biopsy  procedures  (prostate, 
colposcopy, etc.), or other  procedures. The procedures to be evaluated in this study will be selected o n 
an ongoing basis . 
Subjects planned to undergo  a selected procedure , age 18  to 65 years inclusive , will be screened for 
participation at up to 5 study centers  in the [LOCATION_002] .  Screening will occur  within 28  days before 
study drug administration.  After signing the informed consent, demographics and medical history, 
physical examination, clinical  laboratory testing, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy testing, 
and vital sign measurements  will be completed  during the screening visit.  
On the day of the procedure (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment (1:1:1) with 
DEX -IN 50 µg, intravenous (IV) fentanyl  [ADDRESS_436889] will receive an intranasal (IN) dose (DEX -IN or

5 September 2017 1. INTRODUCTION 
Since the year 2000, when the Joint Commission revised their standards for the assessment and 
management of pain, the treatment of pain has taken an increasingly significant position in 
medical care.  Often referred to as the “fifth vital sign”, subjects must now be routinely evaluated 
for pain symptoms so that therapy may be appropriately adjusted. 
While this increased focus has brought more attention to the issue of subject comfort and quality 
of life
, our range of tools has remained largely the same.  Current medications run the gamut in 
duration of activity, ranging from acute medications that provide relief for 1-[ADDRESS_436904] to provide relief (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl).[ADDRESS_436905], with selectivity approximately 10-fold 
that of clonidine.  Dexmedetomidine has an extensive history of safe intravenous use in acute 
care and surgical settings, utilizing its sedative properties, and is indicated for use under the trade 
name [CONTACT_351562]®.  At lower doses, dexmedetomidine has been observed to provide analgesic2 and 
a
nxiolytic3 benefits, without risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].[ADDRESS_436906] shown dexmedetomidine to be well tolerated in 
studies in pediatric patients with doses up to 1.5 µg/kg.  Subsequent studies conducted by [CONTACT_351544] 17.[ADDRESS_436907] been evaluated.  
Dosing with DEX-IN in these studies were generally well tolerated.  These studies and their 
finding
s are discussed further in the DEX-IN Investigators Brochure.  
The use of an intranasal dosage form with dexmedetomidine is intended to provide a noninvasive 
mechanism for rapid drug uptake.  This accelerated uptake facilitates a quick pharmacologic 
re
sponse, with potential benefit for patients experiencing acute pain and anxiety symptoms.  
De
xmedetomidine has the potential to control pain without additional sedation or respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826]. 
The
 current study is planned to evaluate the use of single doses of DEX-IN in an office based or 
outpatient surge
ry/procedure setting where patients may receive limited or no analgesic 
medications.  Patients undergoing these procedures generally experience a range of pain and 
anx
iety symptoms that may not be well managed under the current standard of care.  This study

 To e valuate the anxiolytic effects of DEX- IN 
 To de termine the safety and tolerability of DEX-IN as evaluated with vital sign

3.1. Overall Study Desi gn 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled 
e
valuation of the efficacy and safety of DEX- IN in adult subjects undergoing painful outpatient 
a
nd office based procedures.  The study will enroll up to 250 subjects across up to 5 study 
c
ohorts, with approximately 50-75 subjects per cohort.  Each study cohort will include subjects 
unde
rgoing a specific painful procedure which may include, but is not limited to, cosmetic 
procedures (face peel, liposuction/liposculpture, sclerotherapy, etc.), dental procedures, biopsy 
procedures (prostate, colposcopy, etc.), or other procedures. The procedures to be evaluated in 
thi
s study will be selected on an ongoing basis. 
Subjects requiring a selected procedure, age 18 to 65 years inclusive, will be screened for 
pa
rticipation at up to 5 study centers in the [LOCATION_002].  Screening will occur within 28 days 
be
fore study drug administration.  After signing the informed consent, demographics and 
medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(E
CG), pregnancy testing, and vital sign measurements will be completed during the screening 
visi
t. 
On the day of the procedure (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment (1:1:1) 
with DEX-IN 50 µg, intravenous (IV) fentanyl [ADDRESS_436909] will receive an intranasal (IN) dose

satisfaction with pain experienced during the procedure.  Safety assessments will include 
moni
toring of AEs and SAEs, and vital sign measurements.    
3.2. Rat ionale for Study Design and Control Groups 
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a known drug substance administered via an 
alternative route of delivery.  Previous research has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 
single and repeated doses of dexmedetomidine when administered by [CONTACT_351545] (bunionectomy) populations.    
This s
tudy will explore the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of dosing with DEX-IN in a 
population of subjects undergoing painful offi ce-based and outpatient procedures.  Dosing will 
occur in a single dose setting prior to the procedure to evaluate the benefits of DEX- IN in 
re
ducing the incidence of more severe pain during and following the procedure, as well as 
re
ducing anxiety which may further increase satisfaction with the procedure overall.  These 
effects will be compared between DEX-IN and placebo and active controls.  F entanyl IV is

5.1. Office Based/Outpatient Procedure  
On Day 1, subjects will undergo a painful office based or outpatient procedure according to their 
e
nrolled cohort.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to, cosmetic procedures (face peel, 
liposuction/liposculpture, sclerotherapy, etc.), dental procedures, biopsy procedures (prostate, 
c
olposcopy, etc.), and other outpatient and office based procedures.   
Prior to enrolling any subjects for a study cohort, the procedure to be performed in that cohort 
will
 be defined and a procedure specific cohort manual will be prepared to provide additional 
operational details.  Details provided in the procedure specific cohort manual may include, but 
a
re not limited to, duration of the procedure, materials and techniques to be utilized, number and 
t
ypes of samples to be collected or sites to be treated, etc.  The procedure specific cohort manual 
will be distributed to all investigators who will be eligible to enroll subjects in that cohort for 
review and training. 
[ADDRESS_436921] will receive a single IN dose (DEX-IN or placebo) approximately 1 hour prior 
to the scheduled procedure, and a single IV dose (fentanyl or placebo) approximately 15 minutes 
prior
 to the scheduled procedure.  Study doses will be administered according to the study 
ra
ndomized treatment assignment with IV and IN doses administered as described in Table 1.

[ADDRESS_436922] as a single spray into the right or left nostril.  
Study IV doses will be administered by [CONTACT_351546] a slow IV push over approximately 1-2 
mi
nutes. 
Prior to IN administration, the nostrils should be cleared by [CONTACT_93764] a tissue.  A single dose 
(i.e
., a single spray) will be administered into one nostril with the untreated nostril covered with 
a finger.  The subject’s head should be held in an upright or semi upright position with the spray 
applicator inserted approximately ½-inch into the treated nostril.  The subject should inhale 
gently through the treated nostril as the device is squeezed and the dose is delivered.  The subject 
should inhale normally through the nose and exhale through the mouth for 10-20 seconds while 
maintaining the head upright after dosing.

5 September 2017 5.3. Identity of Study Medication 
5.3.1. IN D osing 
DEX-IN will contain 50 µg dexmedetomidine in each 100 µL of solution (DEX-IN.02 
for
mulation), as well as excipi[INVESTIGATOR_12461]: citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium chloride, 
phenylethyl alcohol, disodium EDTA, and purified water.  DEX-IN doses are calibrated to 
de
liver 50 µg (100 µL) with each dose actuation 
Placebo solution will contain citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium chloride, phenylethyl alcohol, 
disodium EDTA, and purified water.  Placebo doses are calibrated to deliver 100 µL with each 
dose
 actuation 
Doses of DEX-IN/placebo will utilize a unit dose spray device containing the appropriate 
volume of study drug to deliver the assigned dose for administration into the nostril.  
5.3.2. IV D osing 
Fentanyl IV doses will be administered using fentanyl citrate injection USP 50 µg/mL to be 
sourced locally by [CONTACT_977](s).  Each IV fentanyl dose will be administered as 50 µg 
(1 mL )  via slow IV push. 
Placebo IV doses will utilize normal saline, 0.9% sodium chloride injection USP, to be sourced 
locally by [CONTACT_977](s). Each IV placebo dose will be administered as 1 mL via slow IV 
push.
 
5.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
A computer generated randomization scheme will be prepared prior to study initiation for each 
procedure cohort.  Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with DEX- IN, IV fentanyl, or 
placebo in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_436923] been selected following review of pharmacokinetic data in man 
and canine.  Study REC-10-007 evaluated three doses of DEX- IN (17.5 µg in one nostril, or 35 
µg in one nostril or divided between nostrils) in healthy human volunteers.  This study found all 
dose
s to be well tolerated, with the most rapid and extensive absorption seen with a single 
100 µL volume dose, containing 35 µg dexmedetomidine, administered into a single nostril.  
This dos
e achieved plasma concentrations that were observed to produce analgesia in a previous 
study of dexmedetomidine administered by [CONTACT_2747]. 
Upon subsequent evaluation in a repeated dose study in the U.S. (Study REC-11-008), this 35 µg 
dose
 yielded mean observed plasma concentrations below those seen in REC-10-007.  Based on 
thi
s observation, the formulation of DEX-IN was modified to contain 50 µg dexmedetomidine 
base equivalent per 100 µL.  This was explored in a single dose study of efficacy, safety and 
pharmacokinetics in a group of subjects with chronic low back pain (REC-11-010).  This study 
utili
zed doses of 25 and 50 µg per actuation and demonstrated significant efficacy at the 50 µg 
dose level.

5 September 2017 Based on these data, DEX-IN doses of 35 and 50 µg per actuation were evaluated in two studies 
of mode
rate to severe postoperative pain in subjects undergoing bunionectomy (REC-13-012 and 
R
EC-14-013).  Data from these studies demonstrated efficacy of the [ADDRESS_436924]’s eCRF.   
5.7. Blinding and Unblinding of Study Medications 
Study doses will be prepared by [CONTACT_351547]; blinded to IN 
treatment assignment, unblinded to IV treatment assignment. 
All doses administered in this study will be under double-blind conditions; both the subject and 
the inve
stigator/site staff will be blinded to the treatment assignment. That is, the study drug will 
be administered in a double-dummy fashion and each subject will receive a single IN dose 
(D
EX-IN or placebo) and a single IV dose (fentanyl or placebo).   
The study blind may be broken only if the safety of a subject is at risk and the treatment plan for 
that subject depends on which study medication he or she received.  If knowledge of the 
treatment assignment is absolutely necessary for the management of a subject’s safety, the blind 
may be broken by [CONTACT_351548].  
Unless the subject is at immediate risk, the investigator must make diligent attempts to contact 
[CONTACT_318804]’s data.  If a subject’s data are unblinded without the 
prior
 knowledge of the sponsor, the investigator must notify the sponsor as soon as possible and 
no later than the next business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding 
must be clearly documented.

.8. Treatment Compliance 
Study subjects will receive a single IN and a single IV study dose during their participation in the 
study.  All study doses will be observed by (IN) or administered by (IV) study personnel while 
the subject is at the study center.  The exact date and time each dose is administered will be 
re
corded in the subject’s e CRF .

Study medication labeling will include the study number.   
Intravenous study medication (fentanyl and placebo [normal saline]) will be sourced locally by 
[CONTACT_5243](s). 
Sealed randomization envelopes will be provided and should be stored in a locked area with 
controlled access until required to break the blind in the event of an emergent condition in a 
treated subject.  
DEX-IN and IN placebo should be stored at the study site at 25ºC (77ºF), although a range of 
15ºC
 to 30ºC (59ºF to 86ºF) will be permitted.

SERIOUS SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS 
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE, SAE, or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction (SSAR) as provided in 
this 
protocol.  During the study, when there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff 
will be responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol. 
7.1. Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study medication.  Any abnormal laboratory 
value deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], regardless of causal relationship, must be 
reported as an AE beginning after administration of study medication. 
Ex
amples of an AE include the following: 
 significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication under 
study 
 exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (e.g., abnormal physical examination 
finding) 
 signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
 signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study medication o r 
a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unless 
nonserious or serious sequelae occur) 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
 medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE 
 anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen 
 the disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disea
se or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a greater 
frequency than expected for the subject’s condition 
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and regardless of 
causality or seriousness, will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF beginning after 
administration of study medication through the end of the study.  
7
.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria: 
Recro Pharma, Inc. 
Protocol REC-17-023 
C
ONFIDENTIAL 33 
0
5 September 2017  It results in death or is life-threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred).  (This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.) 
 It results in persistent or substantial disability or incapacitation.  (This criterion is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance, such as 
uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.) 
 It results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 It results in prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 I t is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in the offspring of a subject using the study 
medic
ation regardless of time to diagnosis). 
 I t requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes.  
 I t is considered an important medical event. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is serious 
when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent any of the other outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events that may also be 
considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of an SAE. 
Social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137541] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_351538]. 
SAEs will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF after the signing of informed consent through 
the end of the study.  If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE or death that occurs in a 
subject more than [ADDRESS_436937] receives study drug and considers the event to be 
related to the study drug, the investigator is obligated to report the SAE to the sponsor. 
7.3. Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) 
A SAR is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257].  For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
‘r
easonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
c
ausality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
7.4. Definition of a Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction (SSAR) 
A SSAR is any Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) that is determined to be serious, based on the 
outcomes of a SAE described in Section 7.2; i.e. death, life-threatening, causes or prolongs 
Recro Pharma, Inc. 
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_436938] normal life functions, or a congenital abnormality/birth defect. 
7.5. Recording and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or 
symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE. 
7.5.1. Asse ssment of Intensity 
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study, using his or her clinical judgment.  The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the 
eCRF should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
 mild:  an event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and 
doe
s not interfere with everyday activities 
 moderate:  an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities 
 severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity  is a term used to 
de
scribe the intensity of a specific event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  The 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe 
headache).  This is not the same as serious,  which is based on the subject’s or event’s outcome or 
on a
ction criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning (see Section 7.2). 
7.5.2. Asse ssment of Causality 
The investigator is obligated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  The investigator will 
assess the relationship to the study medication by [CONTACT_88550]: 
 Definitely Related :  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The AE 
is most likely explained by [CONTACT_5349].  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if possible) are 
positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study drug.  Another 
etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely. 
 Probably Related :  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The AE 
is more likely explained by [CONTACT_137581].  Dechallenge (if 
performed) is positive. 
 Possibly Related :  An AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug.  The AE 
could have been due to another equally likely cause.  Dechallenge is positive. 
 Not Related :  The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no temporal 
relationship to study drug OR the AE has a much more likely alternate etiology OR the 
AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug.

5 September 2017 Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
transmitting the SAE reporting form and completing the AE eCRF page(s).  The causality 
a
ssessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  The 
investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and 
amend the SAE reporting form and AE eCRF page(s) accordingly. 
7.5.3. Asse ssment of Outcome 
All SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the condition stabilizes, the events are 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up.  The investigator will assess the outcome 
of the event by [CONTACT_137582]: 
 Resolved :  The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae.  An event 
(either serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject experienced 
no restrictions.  Examples include stent placement for coronary artery disease (a device 
implanted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a sequela), a postoperative 
wound infection, or an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. 
 Resolved with sequelae :  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may result 
in 
permanent disability, functional limitation, or both.  Such sequelae are usually limited 
to SAEs.  Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the 
intended outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or emboli 
formation after a bacterial infection resulting in a renal infarct and loss of renal function. 
 Not resolved :  At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown.  
Examples include headache, low-grade fever, or nausea. 
 Unknown : The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to follow-up, 
and the status of the event is unknown. 
 Death 
7.5.4. Asse ssment of Expectedness 
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, expectedness of the SAE will be assessed by [CONTACT_429].  An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator brochure 
or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure 
is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
7.6. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit, until an appropriate 
re
solution can be documented. 
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow each subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition.  All AEs and SAEs 
doc
umented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_351553].

In the initial e-mail, the investigator must provide to the sponsor the following eCRF pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible: 
 AE record 
 medical history 
 prior and concomitant medications 
Also, t
he following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE. 
E-mail transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information.  In rare circumstances 
and in the absence of e-mail capacity, notification by [CONTACT_39984], with a copy 
of the SAE reporting form sent by [CONTACT_9338].  Initial notification via telephone does not 
replace the need for the investigator to complete the SAE reporting form and eCRF pages within 
the tim
e frames outlined. 
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he or she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event.  The form must be 
updated when additional information is received.  Follow-up information received on all SAEs 
Recro Pharma, Inc. 
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_436940] promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section 7.7, “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor.”  The 
sponsor ha
s a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  Prompt 
notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_351555], be 
reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects 
are met. 
Investigator letters are prepared according to sponsor policy and are forwarded to the 
investigators as necessary.  An investigator letter is prepared for any SAR that is attributable to 
study medication, serious, and unexpected.  The purpose of the investigator letter is to fulfill 
specific regulatory and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements regarding the product under 
investigation. 
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. 
7.9. Special Reporting Situations: Pregnancy 
Reports of pregnancy exposure in a female subject (maternal exposure) or female partner of male 
subject (paternal exposure), where the embryo or fetus may have been exposed to investigational 
product through the placenta or semen will be reported. A subject should be instructed to notify 
the investigator immediately of a maternal/paternal pregnancy exposure.  The sponsor must be 
noti
fied of all pregnancies reported to the investigator (see Section 7.[ADDRESS_436941] information). 
A f
emale subject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further study drug 
administration.   
An
y uncomplicated maternal/paternal pregnancy exposures that occurs in a subj ect or female 
pa
rtner of a male subject during this clinical study will be reported for tracking purposes only.  
All subject maternal/paternal pregnancy exposures that are identified during or after this study, 
where the estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred within 30 days of 
receiving study medication need to be reported, followed to conclusion (delivery or termination), 
a
nd the outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued from the study. The investigator 
should report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Pregnancy Report/Outcome Form, 
according to the usual timelines and directions for SAE reporting provided in S ection 7.7. 
Moni
toring of the pregnancy should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy; and follow-up 
detailing the outcome of the pregnancy submitted using the Pregnancy Report/Outcome Form. 
For purposes of follow-up on a paternal pregnancy exposure, in order to collect information on 
the pregnancy and outcome of the pregnancy, informed consent will be requested from the male 
subject and a Pregnant Partner Consent Form completed.

8.3. General Considerations for Statistical Analysis 
The following outlines some of the key elements of the data analysis approach.  A formal 
statistical analysis plan will be developed for this study in which statistical models, data 
derivation methods and rules will be described in detail. 
8.3.1. Anal ysis Datasets  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: The ITT set will include all subjects randomized.  The ITT 
subjects may or may not receive randomized treatment.

5 September 2017 Safety Analysis Set:  The safety analysis set will include all subjects treated with study drug.    
Efficacy Analysis Set: All subjects in the safety analysis set who had required procedure will be 
included in the efficacy analysis. 
8.3.2. T est Hypothesis an d P Value Justification 
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the treatment arms.  The alternative 
h
ypothesis is that the treatment groups are different. 
Differences between DEX- IN, fentanyl, and placebo groups will be evaluated via 2-sided 2-
sa
mple t-test at the 0.05 level of significance. Nominal p-values for secondary and exploratory 
comparisons will be reported without adjustment for multiplicity. 
8.3.3. P rocedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise, no imputation will be done for missing data.  However, AEs with 
missing severity assessments will be tabulated as “severe,” and AEs with missing relationship 
assessments will be tabulated as “related” for the purpose of analysis; and the missing data will 
be presented in data listing as is. 
8.3.4.  Definitions for Assessment Windows 
For the purpose of data analysis,  baseline  measures for a given period will be the last 
mea
surements taken before the subject receives the study medication. 
8.4. Study Population Summaries 
Population summaries will be provided for the safety analysis set included in this study. 
8.4.1. Disp osition 
The summary tables will provide frequency counts for subject disposition (all treated subjects, 
subjects who completed the study, subjects who discontinued from the study, and reason for 
discontinuation) by [CONTACT_137590].   
Disposition in terms of number of subjects excluded from each analysis sets (ITT, safety , 
efficacy) will also be provided by [CONTACT_137590]. 
8.4.2. De mographics and Procedure Characteristics 
The
 demographic summary will include descriptive statistics for age, sex, race, weight, height, 
and BMI for the overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Procedure characteristics will also be tabulated such as procedure type, site, and duration. Th e 
exact information collected for each procedure will be defined in the cohort manual to be 
prepared for each study cohort.  
8.4.3. P rotocol Deviations 
All protocol deviations will be identified.  Tabulation may be provided if data warrant. 
Recro Pharma, Inc. 
Protocol REC-17-[ADDRESS_436944]’s eCRF.  No formal summary of treatment 
c
ompliance will be produced. 
8.4.5. P rior and Concomitant Medications 
All prior and concomitant medications will be tabulated for the overall study population.  Prior 
a
nd concomitant medications will be coded to the therapeutic drug classes and generic drug 
names using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug classifications version 1Q2017 or 
hig
her. 
8.5. Efficacy Analysis 
8.5.1. PI [INVESTIGATOR_351539] 
P

8.5.2. Wor st Pain Intensity 
Worst pain intensity scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_351557] 
c
ohort.   
8.5.3. Anxi ety Assessment 
Anxiety assessment scores will be summarized for the NRS and STAI-6 separately by [CONTACT_3148]

including
: pre-procedure, during the procedure, Hour [ADDRESS_436945] will be 
50 µg dexmedetomidine for subjects in the DEX-IN treatment group, and 50 µg fentanyl for 
subj
ects in the fentanyl treatment group.   
E
valuation of the extent of exposure for the treatment period will be assessed via number of 
dose
s taken. 
8.6.2. Adver se Events 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 20 or higher) will be used to classify 
a
ll AEs with respect to system organ class and preferred term. 
Three types of summaries will be produced for the AE summary: 
1. a n overall summary of AEs: number of subjects with at least one event and number of 
e
vents for all AEs, and SAEs 
2. a  summary table of AEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_196486]  
3. a  summary table of AEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_351558].  AEs that lead to premature 
disconti
nuation from the study or to death will be listed separately via data listings.    
8.6.3. Clin ical Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory values will be collected at screening and Day 1 for enrollment purposes, no data 
summ
ary will be prepared.   
8.6.4. Vital S ign Measurements 
Resting vital sign values and postural vital sign values at each time point collected will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_351559].  Potentially clinically 
sig
nificant changes (PCSC) in vital signs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9084], treatment, and time point.  
P
ostural and resting blood pressure measures will be listed side- by-side for subjects with 
reported orthostatic hypotension. Vital sign listing will be prepared separately for subjects with 
at least one incidence of PCSC in the study.  Time point where the PCSC is observed will be 
flagged. 
PCSC in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) 
measurements will be defined as follows: 
 H ypotension: SBP < 90 mm Hg with a decrease  20 mm Hg from predose, or a DBP  
50 mm
 Hg and decrease  15 mm Hg from predose.   
 Hypertension: SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg with an increase of ≥ 20 mm Hg from predose, or a

[IP_ADDRESS]. Ethics Committees 
The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the 
site’s informed consent form, and any other information that will be presented to potential 
subjects (e.g., advertisements or information that supports or supplements the informed consent 
form) are reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_196490].  The investigator agrees to 
allow the IRB or IEC direct access to all relevant documents.  The IRB or IEC must be 
constituted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.  The sponsor will provide 
the investigator with relevant documents or data needed for IRB or IEC review and approval of 
the study.  Before investigational products can be shipped to the site, the sponsor must receive 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_196453], the approved informed consent form, and any other 
information that the IRB or IEC has approved for presentation to potential subjects. 
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other information that the IRB or IEC has 
approved for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the study, the investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where applicable, these 
amended documents.  The investigator must follow all applicable regulatory requirements 
pertaining to the use of an amended informed consent form, including obtaining IRB or IEC 
approval of the amended form, before new subjects consent to take part in the study using the 
new version of the form.  The investigator must promptly forward to the sponsor copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] 
I
RB or IEC approval of the amended informed consent form or other information and the 
approved amended informed consent form or other information.  IRB or IEC approval of the 
consent forms must be obtained in addition to the approval given for the clinical study.  
Regulatory review and approval may be required in some countries before IRB or IEC approval 
can be sought.

5 September 2017  Human subjects are provided with an adequate understanding of the possible risks of 
their participation in the study, and they have a free choice to participate or not. 
 The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in such a 
way as to ensure the integrity of the findings. 
 The potential benefits of the research justify the risks. 
Recro Pharma, Inc. is the sponsor of study REC-17-023.  The sponsor is responsible for all of the 
following
: 
 selecting qualified investigators 
 providing investigators with the information they need to conduct the investigation 
properly 
 ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation 
 ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all participating investigators are 
properly informed of significant new information regarding AEs or risks associated with 
DEX- IN 
9.1.3. In formed Consent 
The sponsor will provide investigators with a sample informed consent form for this study.  
Investigators are encouraged to use the sample form; however, they may adapt the information to 
suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required elements of 
informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part 50.25).  The final informed consent form must be 
a
ccepted by [CONTACT_196491].  Investigators must provide the 
sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final informed consent form before and after it is approved 
by [CONTACT_4186].  If any new information becomes available that might affect subjects’ 
willingness to participate in the study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to 
the informed consent form, the sponsor will provide investigators with a revised informed 
consent form.  The IRB or IEC must provide written approval of any revisions to the informed 
consent form in advance of its use.  
Investigators must provide subjects with all the information necessary to make an informed 
decision about their participation in the study, including the nature and intended purpose of the 
study, possible benefits, and possible risks. 
All information in the informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether written 
or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical and that is understandable to the subjects. 
Before written informed consent is obtained, the subject should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study.  All questions must be answered to the 
satisfaction of the subject (or his or her legally authorized representative). 
Before a subject undergoes procedures specific to the protocol, the informed consent form must 
be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423] (or his or her legally authorized representative) and any other 
signatories as required by [CONTACT_4186]. 
If a subject (or legally authorized representative) cannot read, a short form approved by [CONTACT_196492].  Only the short form itself is to be signed by [CONTACT_318820], Inc.

and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign the copy of the summary in accordance 
with 21 CFR 50.27 (b2). 
Af
ter all required signatures have been obtained, a copy of the informed consent form should be 
provided to the subject, and the original must be kept on file at the site and made available for 
review by [CONTACT_456].  Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the 
subject’s case history. 
9.1.4. In vestigator Reporting Requirements 
The investigator is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and accurate eCRFs and 
source documentation.  Source documentation constitutes original records (first point of entry, 
either hard copy or electronic), which may include progress notes, medication administration 
records, operation reports, laboratory reports, discharge summaries, and so on.   
9.2. Study Monitoring 
The sponsor is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with regard to subject 
protection, ethics, protocol adherence, site procedures, and integrity of the data.  At regular 
intervals during the study, the sponsor’s study monitors will contact [CONTACT_318821], telephone calls, and letters in order to review study progress and eCRF completion and 
to addr
ess any concerns or questions regarding the study conduct.  During monitoring visits, the 
following aspects of study conduct will be carefully reviewed: subjects’ informed consent 
documents, subject recruitment procedures, subjects’ compliance with the study procedures, 
source-data verification, drug accountability, use of concomitant therapy by [CONTACT_1766], AE and 
SAE documentation and reporting, and quality of data. 
9.3. Quality Assurance 
The sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IRB representative may visit the study site at any time 
during the study or after completion of the study to perform audits or inspections.  The purpose 
of a sponsor audit or regulatory inspection is to examine systematically and independently all 
study-related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted 
according to the protocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, and any other applicable regulatory 
requirements.  Investigators should contact [CONTACT_167449] a regulatory 
agency about an inspection at their site. 
9.4. Study and Site Closure 
If the sponsor, investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study site should be 
closed, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and 
investigator.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 
 discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the

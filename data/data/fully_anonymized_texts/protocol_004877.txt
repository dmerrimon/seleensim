Sponsor or Funding Source: Departmental, Commercial : (ViOptix , Newark, [LOCATION_004])  ViOptix will be 
providing a portable ViOptix  terminal and sensors for the project.  
 
Background, Rationale, and Context  
 
Transcutaneous oximetry monitoring , which utilizes near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) 
technology,  is one of many modalities in existence to monitor the post -operative circulatory status of 
microvascular skin flap reconstruction1. Specifically NIRS devices such as the ViOptix T.Ox Tissue 
Oximeter (Newark C A.) have the ability to detect vascular compromise in microsurgical flaps prior to 
gold standard techniques such as serial clinical exam and handheld doppler2. The ViOptix T.Ox machine 
utilizes NIRS to measure the oxygenation of composite tissue. The technology is able to assess the 
oxygenation of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_447925] – this reads a  percent tissue oxygenation (StO 2). 
 
Success rates of microsurgical  procedures h as increased in recent years but complications still 
exist. The most common reason for flap failure is vascular thrombosis, and venous thrombosis occurs 
three times more often in free flaps than arterial occlusion3,4. Additionally the success rate of flap 
salvage is higher for venous congestive problems when compared to arterial complications3. Larger scale 
studies have also been conducted which demonstrate the use of ViOptix monitoring can improve flap 
salvage rates and decrease the rate of total f lap loss 2,5,6. Although technique improvements have 
decreased complications, microvascular complications such as venous congestion still routinely occur 
post operatively in free flap procedures. Most free flap micro vascular complications  occur within the 
first [ADDRESS_569606] op of StO 2 of 20% in an hour or an absolute StO 2 reading below 30% 
indicates flap compromise 2. This criteria may still produce false positives leading to patients returning to 
the OR without microvascular complication 6.  
 
The body o f research on NIRS and non -invasive free flap monitoring has grown significantly in 
recent years. To our knowledge these studies have not been able to describe an inflection point or a 
specific pattern which characterizes the venous congestion curve. Identify ing these specific patterns will 
help to establish an evidence -based approach in recognizing specific problems and patterns associated 
with tissue compromise that can guide physicians to consider earlier  flap sa lvage measures .  
 
Objectives  
 
We hypothesize  the rate of decline and pattern seen in tissue oxygenation as quantified by a 
NIRS device (ViOptiox T.Ox) can be quantified and described by a mathematical model which will allow 
earlier detection and identification of venous congestion in tissue. The vascular o cclusion test has been 
established as a safe and accurate model to induce various states of vascular insufficiency and occlusion  
8–15. Specifically the v ascular occlusion test has been demonstrated to be an accurate model for inducing 
venous insufficiency  on awake and aware patient s 14. This study will aim to analyze the StO [ADDRESS_569607] signs of tissue failure in various states of vascular 
compromise .  
 
Methods and Measures  
 
Design :  
Subjects will be recruited through convenience sampling. Subjects will be given a study number 
at the initiation of the study and will not be identified through any identifying information throughout 
the study.  
 
First,  participants included will enter an examination room in the Department of Plastic and 
Reconstructive Surgery clinic. Subjects will be acclimatized for a minimum of [ADDRESS_569608] their baseline vitals 
measured a nd recorded , including heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, height, weight, and BMI.  
Their blood pressure will be taken once  on each arm  to determine the baseline blood p ressure .   The 
variables to be measured and recorded will be pulse oximetry (SpO 2), transcutaneous oximetry  (StO 2), 
demographic informatio n, and past medical history.  
 
The ViOptix machine has the capability to measure two StO [ADDRESS_569609] the study room.  
 
Setting:  
The study will be conducted in a clinic room of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive surgery. 
Subj ects will include volunteers who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written informed 
consent for application of upper extremity tourniquet and monitoring by [CONTACT_27189].  
 
Subjects Selection Criteria  
  
To be included in this study it is required that human subject participants are between 18 and 65 years 
of age  and meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 Age 18 – 65 volunteers  
 
Exclusion Criteria   
 Subject s with a h istory of major cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease 
including (vascular insufficiency ), Raynaud syndrome, blood dyscrasias, pain 
syndromes, neurologic conditions, major upper extremity soft tissue trauma or 
previous vascular injury,  
 
Sample Size  
To ensure the study is adequately powered, w e aim to include [ADDRESS_569610] s in the study.  We will 
terminate data collection if 100 subjects undergo data collection process.  
 
The number of subjects recruited has been determined by [CONTACT_1629] a priori sample size calculation using 
the statistical software G*Power. Alpha will be set at 5% and beta a t 20%. The necessary sample size 
will be determined based on p reviously collected  data regarding the means and standard deviations 
of the measured variables, transcutaneo us oximetry number in experimental and control conditions.  
Based on a previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_447926] a large effect size in our data gathering. Given these 
previously researched values and effect size an early statistical sample size estimate using G*Power 
suggests a sample size of [ADDRESS_569611] -operatively. For t hat intended use, The T.OxTM sensor is packaged as a 
sterile device and is intended for single -use in a sterile environment. For this study however, the 
monitors are being placed on the wrists of patients with no surgical interventions. The monitors will 
remain on for only the length of the study visit (~35min) as opposed to 48 hours after a surgery.  
 
Because this is a non -significant risk study for non -invasive data collection only, we plan to re -use the 
sterile T.OxTM sensor on multiple subjects with appr opriate cleaning (Sani Cloth AF3 wipe) between uses 
as with any non -sterile device used on multiple subjects. The device will be allowed to dry for [ADDRESS_569612] protected.   No reference to any individual participant will appear in 
reports, presentations, or publicatio ns that may arise from the study.  The planned data to be collected 
will not include any of the 18 personal identifiers set forth by [CONTACT_2373].

 Efficacy of 1540nm Erbium glass laser to improve benign dermatofibromas  
 
BACKGROUND:  
Dermatofibromas are benign histiocytic fibrous nodules that arise in the skin, and are reported more often seen on the legs and in women.  These nodules can be itchy, painful and unattractive with 
discoloration or textural irregularities.  
 Prior to use of lasers to treat dermatofibromas, dermatologists have tried  to treat these nodules with 
liquid nitrogen and intralesional Kenalog injections but both these options are considered less than ideal and pose significant risks for worsening the l esions.  In addition, dermatofibromas can be excised, but 
excision guarantees a scar, and surgical leg wounds and scars  in adult women are often compromised in 
their healing by [CONTACT_94890].  
 There are case reports of improvement of dermatofibromas w ith other lasers such as the pulsed -dye 
laser and the CO2 laser (see attachments), but no clinical studies using laser treatment.  In addition, the 
non-ablative Erbium glass laser is a generally safer laser being non -ablative and is being more widely 
used in medical and cosmetic dermatology practices as it can be operated in most states (in the U.S.) by 
[CONTACT_94891] P.A. or Aestheticians.  It would be  helpful to have a treatment option that can be so widely 
used.   
 PURPOSE & OBJECTIVES  
The main objective of this study is to find a more effective  treatment for itchy, painful or 
unsightly dermatofibromas, that will improve symptoms of itch and/or pain and/or improve the appearance of dermatofibromas.   A secondary objective of this study is to better understand  
the 1540nm Erbium glass laser and its impact on the skin.   
  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  Data Analysis:  Two dermatologists will review all de -identified photos, and will rate them on a color, 
texture improvement scale as shown in the attached questionnaires. We expect to recruit about [ADDRESS_104939] to determine whether the color and texture improvement is significant at two 
visits (i.e. visits #4 and #5) after [ADDRESS_104940] regression to evaluate the association between laser treatment and dermatofibroma symptom and appearance. All these statistical analyses will be conducted using statistical software R at the significant level of 0.05. We do not anticipate substantial missing data for the outcomes assessed since our physician will be very less likely to miss items in the survey. Even though we don’t anticipate that there is a substantial amount of missing  data in our study, we will still compare the characteristics of 
subjects with complete versus incomplete data to assess the possibility of bias due to missing. If subjects with incomplete is systematically different from those with complete data, our comp lete-case analysis 
may be biased. We will use inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach, where complete cases are weighted by [CONTACT_94892] a complete case, to correct the bias induced by [CONTACT_94893].

  Added via Addendum (17MAY20 18): We increased laser settings after the 13th patient, and therefore, 
we are now are going to increase enrollment to [ADDRESS_104941] the follow -up visits done 
remotely in hopes of increasing the number of subjects that will complete all visits.    
 STUDY DESIGN:  This is a Prospective, interventional, Single -Blinded, open label trial.  Blinded photography outcomes 
assessors.   Added via Addendum (17MAY2018): Enrollment Goal: 40 patients  
 PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY  
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Male or Female ages [ADDRESS_104942] be  either itchy, painful, or unattractive  to the patient.  
Exclusion criteria:  
1. Previous trea tment to the dermatofibroma(s)  
2. Pregnant or nursing women  
3. A diagnosis of diabetes, psoriasis,  lupus or other autoimmune diseases.  
4. A current tobacco smoker   
5. A history of keloids or poor wound healing.   
6. Dermatofibroma lesions on the face and genitals.   
 
Recruitment:  
Participants will be recruited or identified for inclusion in the study using in -person contact, referrals, 
and writte n or electronic record review.  P atients who appear to be eligible for the study will be 
approached during regular clinic visits by [CONTACT_3462]. Electronic record review may be used to find possible subjects from existing patients.   
 STUDY PROCEDURES : 
1. Screening Visit (Visit #1):  Perform Informed Consent process.  Review inclusion/exclusion criteria with 
written questionnaire,  and review  post -laser treatment instruction sheet.  
2.  Baseline Visit/1st of 2 Laser Treatments (Visit #2):  Sign SJHC laser  treatment consent form, fill out 
dermatofibroma symptom questionnaire, take pre -treatment photos of dermatofibroma(s), perform 
first laser treatment.  
3.  Visit #3, Second Laser treatment, four  weeks after first treatment.  Patient will fill out 
dermatofib roma symptom questionnaire again.  Pre-treatment photos taken of dermatofibroma(s) 
again.  Patient will sign SJHC laser treatment consent form, perform second laser treatment.    
4.  Visit #4, Four  weeks follow up after second laser  treatment.  Patient to f ill out dermatofibroma 
symptom questionnaire, photos taken again.   This visit may be completed remotely by [CONTACT_94894](s) through MyChart.   If

 subjects are experiencing any side ef fects or changes to their health, they should be seen in person by 
[CONTACT_5989].   
5.  Visit #5, 12  weeks  follow up, 16 weeks after second laser treatment.  Patient to fill out 
dermatofibroma symptom questionnaire, final photos taken.   This visit may  be completed remotely by 
[CONTACT_94895](s) through 
MyChart.  If subjects are experiencing any side effects or changes to their health, they should be seen in 
person by [CONTACT_94896].

Data Monitoring Plan: 
- Research intervention is conducted in a prive place  
- Study will be discussed with patients individually  
- The collection of information about participants is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the 
aims of the research so that no unneeded information is being collected.  
- Research data will be stored on password protected computers  
- Photos of participants will be stored in the patient’s secure electronic medical record.  
- Periodic review and confirmation of participant elegibility , informed consent documentation and 
conformation that appropriate information has been reported to IRB will occur annually.    
- Independent Safety Monitor will review consent documentation, and adverse events after every 10 
patients or every 6 months (whic hever comes first).

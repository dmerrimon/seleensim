5 This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled study to be conducted in the 
[LOCATION_002]. Approximately 164 subjects  with treatment -resistant pruritus diagnosed with atopic 
dermatitis, who satisfy the selection criteria for the study, will be randomized to receive either 
tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 85 mg or matching placebo BID.   
The study is divided into two phases: the pre-treatment phase and the evaluation phase. The pre-
treatment phase includes  a screening and a baseline visit whe re subjects’ eligibility for the study 
will be assessed . Washout of medications per  Section 7.2 will occur during the screening phase.  
The evaluation phase includ es 8 weeks of randomized double -blind  treatment. In clinic 
evaluations will occur at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Efficacy assessments will in clude:  
• Daily Diary Itch Scale (DDIS)  
• Pruritus Visual Analogue S cale (VAS)   
• Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) item “pruritus”  
• SCOR ing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)  index  
• Eczema Area Scoring Index ( EASI )  
• Daily Diary Sleep Scale  (DDSS ) 
• Clinical Global Impression  of Change (CGI -C) 
• Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) 
• Skindex -16 
• Patient Benefi t Index (PBI)  
Safety:  
• Safety and tolerability  assessments will include the recording of adverse events 
(AEs), physical examinations, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 
electrocardiograms.  
• The Columbia -Suicide Severity Scale (C-SSRS) will be used to assess suicidal 
behavior and ideation . 
Statistical methods:   
Primary Endpoint:  
 
• Mean change from baseline in pruritus symptoms in the tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_181932]:   
• Mean change from baseline in pruritus intensity in the tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_181933]-VLY-686-2102   Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol                                     03 March  2017

6 • Mean change from baseline of disease severity  in the tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_181934] (SCORAD)  index  
• Mean change from baseline of disease severity  in the tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_181935] (EASI)  
• Mean change from baseline in the daily diary sleep scale (DDSS)  in the tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_181936].  
• Mean global improvement measured by [CONTACT_87793] -Change 
(CGI -C), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C), Skindex -16, and the Patient 
Benefit Index (PBI)   
• Mean change from baseline in pruritus intensity in relation to serum concentrations 
of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_181937].   
 
Statistical analyses will be performed using two -sided tests.  The details of analysis models will 
be specified in the SAP.

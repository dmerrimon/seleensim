PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study title:  
A randomized, open -label, parallel- group study to evaluate the efficacy of the digital therapeutic 
OXD01  (MODIA ™) in combination with sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].

Background/Rationale:  
Medication -assisted t reatment, the current standard  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827],  is the use of medications  
in combination with counseling and behavioral t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_559439] a “whole -patient” approach to 
the treat ment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD). However, patients may not have optimal access to face -
to-face clinical behavioral health services. Digital therapeutics can help bridge the gap between 
accessible services and optimal treatment of OUD , the primary goal of which is to reduce the use of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] . OXD01 is a device -based digital therapeutic , designed to offe r individuals diagnosed with 
OUD quality psychotherapy intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational 
interviewing .  This study is being conducted to determine the value of OXD01 when combined with 
medication to change opi[INVESTIGATOR_559440].  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective:  
 
The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the combination of sublingual (SL) buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NAL)  standard of care (SOC) background therapy  and the digital 
therapeutic OXD01 is superior to SL BUP/NAL  alone  to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], as measured by [CONTACT_559505]. Treatment success is defined as the subject having ≥ 80% of urine drug 
tests negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_559441] -reports  for illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (from the TLFB interview  at 
the same visit ) from Week 6 to Week 25.    
  
Secondary Objectives:  
 
Compare the treatment groups for the following outcomes:  
 
• Cumulative response – The cumulative response rate over a period from Week [ADDRESS_734888] for opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942] a self-report negative for illicit use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_192845] a study visit.  
 
• Illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] - The cumulative response rate over a period from Week [ADDRESS_734889] to the percentage of urine drug tests negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] . 
 
Clinical study protocol OXD01 -001   
 
Version: 1.0, 19 April 2021  3 (48)  
 
• Self-reports of illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] - The cumulative response rate over a period from Week [ADDRESS_734890] to the percentage of self -reports negative for illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942]. 
 
• Percentage of subjects abstinent - Abstinence  is defined as a subject having a urine drug test  
negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_559442]- reports negative for illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_559443] 25 . 
 
• Proportion of subject s completing the study - A completer is defined as a participant who 
completed either the UDS or the self -report assessment at the Week 25  visit. 
 
• Clinical global impression - This will be evaluated in two ways:  
 
o Scor e on the Clinical Global Impression -Improvement  scale at Week 12 and Week 25  
o Change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression -Severity  score  at Week 12 and  
Week 25  
 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2570] - Change from baseline in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_559444] 4  to Week 25 . 
 
• Illicit u se of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_238352] - The cumulative percentage of subject s with urine drug 
tests negative for drugs  of abuse  (excluding opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) plus  self- reports negative for use  of drugs 
of abuse  for the period from Week 6  to Week 25 . 
 
• Number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] , emergency department visits , and overdoses , and the ability  to 
resume work, school, or other productive activity  
 
• Adverse events (AE). 
 
Treatments:  
• SL BUP/NAL SOC background therapy  
• SL BUP/NAL  + OXD01 digital therapy  for 15-30 minutes , 1-2 times per week  
 
Subjects in both groups will receive the assigned treatment for 24 weeks . Note: No investigational 
product will be administered as part of this study. Subjects in both groups may also be encouraged 
to participate in behavioral health therapi[INVESTIGATOR_559445] ’s standard of 
practice.

Methodology : 
This is an open -label, randomized, parallel- group multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy 
of the digital therapeutic OXD01 combined with SL BUP/NAL  SOC background therapy  compared to 
SL BUP/NAL alone to change opi[INVESTIGATOR_559446] s in subject s with OUD.  
 
Approximately [ADDRESS_734891] four weeks of treatment, then every other week from 
weeks 5 through 12, then monthly through week 25. Subjects will also return to the site for only a 
UDS and a self- report of drug use each week between the evaluation visits.  
 
Statistical Considerations : 
Treatment success is defined as the subject having ≥ 80% of urine drug tests negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_559447] ≥ 80 % of self -reports negative for illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (from the TLFB interview  at the same visit ) 
from Week 6 to Week 25 of the study.  Current literature suggests that the proportion of subjects likely to be successful by [CONTACT_559506] 12%.  [1] If OXD01 is effective in improving this percentage to 25%, approximately 200 
subjects will be required to receive each treatment to provide 90% power to detect such a difference at an 𝛼𝛼  = 0.05 level ( chi-squared t est).  Approximately 510 opi[INVESTIGATOR_559448] 400 subjects.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
 
In 2017, 70,237 drug overdose deaths occurred in the [LOCATION_002]. The age-adjusted rate of overdose deaths increased significantly by 9.6% from 2016 (19.8 per 100,000) to 2017 (21.7 per 100,000).   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , 
primarily synthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_559453] , are currently the main driver of drug overdose deaths 
and were implicated in 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017 (67.8% of all drug overdose deaths).  [2] 
 Effective and available treatment is the gateway to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with 
drug addiction. Medication -assisted t reatment (MAT) , the current standard for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827],  is the use 
of medications, in combination with counseli ng and behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], to provide a “whole -patient” 
approach to the treat ment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) . Research shows that MAT can successfully treat 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] ( OUD) , and for some people can help sustain recovery.  [3] 
 Successful MAT implementation requires the availability of varying levels and types of care in a range of 
settings, although all of the necessary services may not be available to all patients . Patients appropriate 
for outpatient care require access to office -based buprenorphine prescribing (or opi[INVESTIGATOR_103587] s that provide methadone) and clinical behavior al health services . However, the National Center 
for Health Workforce Analysis estimates that between 40 million and 45 million individuals (roughly 20 percent  of the U.S. 2013 population) may have needed but did not receive behavioral health care in  2013. 
The National Center completed a projection of US supply and demand for behavioral h ealth practitioners 
in 2025 and identified s ix provider types that are tracking for shortage  of more than 10,000 full-time 
equivalents: psychiatrists; clinical, counseling, and school psychologists; substance abuse and behavioral 
disorder counselors; menta l health and substance abuse social workers; mental health counselors; school 
counselors.  [4]  
 Clearly one challenge for healthcare providers working on the front of the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_559454], particularly  behavioral health services. However, based 
on the National Center estimate , trained behavioral health professionals will not join the workforce in 
adequate numbers to meet the demand for services.  The evidence is that man y patients who require 
behavioral health services are not getting access, or chose not to engage in face- to-face therapy. N ew 
modes of service delivery are necessary  to close the gap between patients and the treatment required for 
recovery from addiction.   Digital therapeutics , an innovative  new category of mobile medical applications that help treat diseases by 
[CONTACT_559507]- term health outcomes , are 
poised to improve the quality of healthcare across a broad spectrum of the market . Digital therapeutics 
implement treatment programs tailored to specific ailments, and the early evidence is that these digital 
health programs, often combined with human coaching/interaction, can effectively close service gaps and make a significant difference in health outcomes.  In addition, digital health programs can be tailored and 
optimized for individual patients and delivered at scale via mobile  devices , which can conceivably be 
transformative to the healthcare marketplace . With precise regimes and daily monitoring, digital 
therapeutics offer valuable data t hat can provide doctors insight  into patient behavior and create 
feedback/optimization loops for individual patients. Enabling patients to take greater control over 
managing their chronic illnesses and preventing disease progression could yield substantial  cost savings 
througho ut the entire healthcare system, and evidence suggests that treatment adherence may be 
improved by [CONTACT_559508].  [5] 
Clinical study protocol OXD01 -001   
 
Version: 1.0, 19 April 2021  10 (48) 
 
 
OXD01 is a n individualized  device -based digital therapeutic designed to be an adjunctive treatment tool 
for OUD. OXD01 is designed to offer individuals diagnosed with OUD quality psychotherapy intervent ion 
based on cognitive  behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing , implemented through  a smart 
application with artificial intelligence.  
 OXD01 has not been studied in patients with OUD  receiving standard of care  (SOC)  MAT with sublingual 
buprenorphine /naloxone . The current study is being conducted to determine the value of OXD01 to 
reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_559455].   
2. STUDY OBJECT VES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective of the study is to determine whether  the combination of sublingual (SL) 
buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NAL)  SOC background therapy  and the digital therapeutic OXD01 is 
superior to SL BUP/NAL alone to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], as measured by [CONTACT_559509]. 
Treatment success is defined as t he subject having ≥ 80% of urine drug tests negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_559456]- reports for illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] ( based on  the timeline followback  [TLFB ] interview at the same 
visit) from Week 6 to Week 25 .   
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
The secondary objective s are to compare the treatment group s for the following outcomes:  
 
• Cumulative response – The cumulative response rate from Week [ADDRESS_734899]  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_205650] a negative self-
report  for illicit use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_559457] a s tudy  visit.  
 
• Illicit u se of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] - The cumulative response rate from Week [ADDRESS_734900] s negative for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] .

• Percentage of subjects abstinent - Abstinence  is defined as a subject having a urine drug test  negative 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_559458]-reports for illicit  use of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] s at Week 25 . 
 
• Proportion of subjects completing the study - A completer is defined as a participant who completed 
either the UDS or the self -report assessment at the Week 25  visit. 
 
• Clinical global impression - Will be evaluated by : 
 
o Scor e on the Clinical Global Impression -Improvement (CGI -I) scale at Week 12 and Week 25  
o Change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression -Severity  (CGI -S) score  at Week 12 and  
Week 25

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
This is an open -label, randomized, parallel- group multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy of the 
digital therapeutic OXD01 combined with SL BUP/NAL  SOC background therapy compared to  SL BUP/NAL  alone 
in the treatment of subject s with OUD.  
 
Approximately 510 opi[INVESTIGATOR_559461] 400 subjects. Current 
literature suggests that the proportion of subjects likely to be successful by [CONTACT_559510] 12%.  [1] If OXD01 is effective in improving this percentage to 25%, 
approximately 200 subjects will be required to receive each treatment to provide 90% power to d etect such a 
difference at an 𝛼𝛼  = 0.05 level (Fisher’s Exact Test).   
 
The study will include a screening visit  and a randomization visit , followed by  [ADDRESS_734902] will participate in  24 study visits (11 evaluation visits plus 13 visits to perform  only  a 
urine drug screen ( UDS) and collect a subject self- report of drug use , Figure 1 ).  
 The screening visit will identify opi[INVESTIGATOR_559462] -to-severe OUD.  Subject s 
who have received MAT for OUD within 14 days or those with a diagnosis of moderate to severe substance use 
disorder involving  psychoactive substances other than opi[INVESTIGATOR_559463].  
 Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio:  
 
• SL BUP/NAL  SOC background therapy  
• SL BUP/NAL  + OXD01 digital therapy   
 Subjects in both groups  will receive the assigned treatment for 24 weeks.  Note: No investigational product will 
be administered as part of this study.  Subjects in both groups may also be encouraged to participate in 
behavioral health therapi[INVESTIGATOR_559445] ’s standard of practice.  
 On study Day [ADDRESS_734903] been  stabilized on SL  BUP/NAL . Subjects randomized to BUP/NAL pl us 
OXD01 digital therapy will use  the OXD01 application  as non -pharmacologic treatment for their OUD. OXD01 is a 
web -based software platform  that can be used on a mobile phone, tablet, or computer with a compatible 
browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari.

Version: 1.0, 19 April 2021  15 (48) 
 
3.1 Selection of Study Design  
3.1.1 Overall Study Design  
 
This is a prospective, open -label, randomized, parallel-group superiority study designed to determine whether 
the efficacy of OXD01 combined with SL BUP/NAL  SOC background therapy  is superior to BUP/NAL alone in the 
treatment of subject s with OUD. The study is comprised of a screening visit and a randomization visit, followed 
by 24 weeks of study treatment and 24 study visits ([ADDRESS_734908] self -report of drug use ). 
 A randomized, parallel- group design is selected to  assure an adequately controlled study. An open -label design 
is necessary because there is not a placebo or sham validated for the OXD01 digital therapeutic. 
3.1.2 Study Treatments  
 
On study Day 1, subjects  stabilized on SL BUP/NAL  SOC background therapy  will be randomized to SL BUP/NAL 
alone, or to SL BUP/NAL plus the OXD01 digital therapeutic. A stabilized subject  will have completed SL BUP/NAL 
induction, with physical withdrawal symptoms reduced so the subject  is able to fulling participate in OXD01 
training , if randomized to that treatment group. Induction with SL BUP/NAL and titration to a maintenance dose 
that suppresses withdrawal signs and symptoms is  described in the product information under Dosage and 
Administration  and can be implemented  in accordance with the Investigator ’s standard of practice.  Note: No 
investigational product will be administered as part of this study.  
 
Subjects randomized to SL BUP/NAL plus OXD01 will be trained to use OXD01 on Day [ADDRESS_734909] dose of SL BUP/NAL induction .  
 Subjects in both groups will use  the assigned treatment for [ADDRESS_734910] 
be in generally good health, seeking MAT treatment for moderate or severe OUD (absent a moderate to severe  
use disorder for other psychoactive substances) and ha s not received MAT for OUD wi thin [ADDRESS_734911] meet the following criteria to qualify for the study.  
 1. Male or female  18 – 65 years of age  at the screening visit , fluent in English and able to read, comprehend,

AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign, symptom, or disease tempora lly associated with the 
use of the device, whether or not considered related to the intended use of the device . 
 Pre-existing conditions will not be regarded as AEs if the condition follows a normal course of recovery, unless it 
worsens after exposure to the device . Medical procedures will not be  regarded as AEs, but the cause of the 
procedure may be.

7.1.[ADDRESS_734934] 
a reasonable possibility;  i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_734935]  (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the device ; or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the safety or welfare of subjects.  
7.1.4 Serious Adverse Event  
 An SAE is an AE that:  
 
• results in death  
• is life threatening  
• requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_559477]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is another important medical event (e.g. , convulsions not leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ) 
 Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_559478] ’s health or may require intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in the definitions above. These AEs should also usually be considered as  serious . 
 SAEs will only be considered when there is an underlying AE. For example, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80334] a pre -existing 
condition which is not due to an aggravation of the condition after exposure to any study treatment will not be 
considered to be an SAE.  
7.[ADDRESS_734936] s will be monitored throughout the study for any AE s, including abnormal, clinically significant, 
laboratory values, clinically significant findings at physical examinations, vital signs measurements or electrocardiogram ( ECG) measurements, spontaneous reports by [CONTACT_62444] s and observations by [CONTACT_71510] .

7.4 Recording of A dverse Events  
 
All AEs should be recorded in the CRF s. Although an AE can initially be acknowledged by [CONTACT_559523], an Investigator will always be responsible for reporting and assessments of AEs. All AEs should be 
reported separately (i.e . one record per event). Reporting of AEs are event based, (i.e. , an ongoing event will not 
be closed until resolved or at the end of study). At least the following will be recorded for each AE:  
 Description of adverse event: Adverse event description should be provided in English. Diagnosis is to be 
preferred over symptoms. If no diagnosis could be made, each symptom will be reported as a separate AE. 
Abbreviations should be avoided. Descri ptive  words should be used for ongoing conditions as applicable (e.g. 
“exacerbation of herpes genitalis”, “worsening of eczema” etc.).  
 Serious adverse event:  Yes or no (definition of SAE in section 7.1.4). If Yes, a n SAE Report Form needs to be 
completed.  
 Maximum intensity: Maximum intensity of the AE during the complete course of the event should be recorded 
in accordance with the following definitions:  
 
• Mild – Awareness of sign and symptoms but easily tolerated  
• Moderate – Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities  
• Severe – Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
 Duration: The duration of the AE will be recorded by [CONTACT_559524].  
 
Relatedness to medical device  (causality):
 Relatedness to the medical device will be assessed by [CONTACT_559525].    
 
• Not related : A causal relationship between the medical device  and the AE is assessed as not possible 
(e.g. due to onset in relation to use of the device  or that another cause of the AE has been identified )  
• Related : A causal relationship between the medical device  and the AE is assessed as at least possible  
 
Actions taken: Actions taken in relation to the AE  with respect to use of the medical device , should be recorded 
as: 
 
• Use of the medical device withdrawn  
• Use of the medical device interrupted  
• Use of the medical device is reduced  
• Use of the medical device is increased  
• Use of the medical device not changed  
• Not applicable  
• Unknown  
 Any medication given to treat the AE will be record ed separately on the concomitant medication list of the CRF s. 
  
Clinical study protocol OXD01 -001   
 
Version: 1.0, 19 April 2021  27 (48) 
 
 
Outcome: The outcome of the AE should be recorded.  
 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving  
• Not recovered/Not resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Fatal 
• Unknown – lost to follow -up 
7.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting/ Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects − Procedures for Investigators  
7.5.1 Initial Reports  
 
All SAEs /UADEs  occurring from the time of informed consent until discharge from the study must be reported to 
Medpace Clinical Safety with in 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence. After discharge from the study , any 
SAE/UADE  that the Investigator considers related to study drug must be reported to the Medpace Clinical Safety 
or the Sponsor/designee.  
 To report the SAE/UADEs , complete t he form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) system for the 
study. When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified electronically by [CONTACT_248129]. If the event meets serious criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to Medpace Safety at medpace -[EMAIL_1925] or call the Medpace SAE 
reporting line (phone number listed below), and fax/email the completed paper form to Medpace (contact [CONTACT_248130] 7.5.2 ) within [ADDRESS_734938] continue to follow the patient until the SAE /UADE  has subsided or  until the condition 
becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the patient dies.  
 
Within [ADDRESS_734939] update the form electronically in the 
EDC system for the stu dy and submit any supporting documentation ( e.g., patient discharge summary or 
autopsy reports) to Medpace Clinical Safety via fax or e -mail. If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer

Version: 1.0, 19 April 2021  28 (48) 
 
7.6 Reporting Responsibilities  
 
Orexo will report UADEs to the FDA. Medpace will be responsible for submitting reports of UADEs to sites and 
Central IRBs according to applicable regulations and stipulated timelines. Sites will be responsible for reporting 
to local IRBs as required.   
 In the event an SAE is reported as related to BUP/NAL (SOC background therapy), Medpace will forward this information to the manufacturer for postmarketing reporting to the FDA as re quired.  
7.[ADDRESS_734940] and either continue or discontinue BUP/NAL 
treatment based on their clinical judgement.  
 The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital 
abnormality) must be followed up and documented even after the subject  was discontinued from the trial.  
 All events of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported 
and handled as SAEs.  
 
8. MEDICAL SAFETY  
8.1 Expected Side Effects  
8.1.1 OXD01  
 
Since OXD01 is a non- systemic therapy for OUD, the likelihood of adverse events is low. However, the following 
emotions may occur when using the application:  
 
• Disappointment if there is no benefit  
• Distress when presented with particular topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  
• Frustratio n, or other distressing emotions, if the content is found to be confusing, overwhelming, or 
unsuitable.   
 
Subjects should be directed to contact [CONTACT_559526].

The protocol and the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_559527] [ADDRESS_734942] s should be implemented directly and the sponsor and IRB should then be notified as soon as possible. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_559480] F amendments/revisions, along with letters noting IRB approval, will be submitted to 
the sponsor. Any addendum , amendment, or revision that substantially alters the study design or increases 
potential risk to the subject  requires the subject 's consent to continue in the study.  
9.3 Records  
 Adequate records will be maintained for the study as required by [CONTACT_559528]  
(ICH) Good Clinical Practices ( GCP). This will include volunteer medical records, CRFs, laboratory reports, work 
sheets, signed ICFs, drug dispensing records, AE  reports, information regarding volunteers’ discontinuation and 
similar.  Following completion of the study, Medpace will supply the sponsor with originals of the CRFs  (or a copy if 
electronic CRFs are used) and copi[INVESTIGATOR_559481] . CRF copi[INVESTIGATOR_559482] . No study related e ssential documents , records or data

APPENDIX  D: TIMELINE FOLLOWBACK METHOD – DRUGS AND ALCOHOL  
 
 
 
To help us evaluate your drug and alcohol use, we need to get an idea of what your use was like in the past days. To do this, we would like you to fill out the attached calendar.  
 
 Filling out the calendar is not  hard! 
 Try to be as accurate as  possible. 
 We recognize you won’t have perfect recall. That’s  OKAY. 
 
 WHAT TO FILL  IN 
• The idea is that for each day on the calendar we want you to indicate whether you “used"  or “did not use ” 
 drugs  or alcohol . Specifically indicate whether you have used any of the following:  amphetamines (uppers), barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (for example , Xanax, Ativan, Valium), cocaine, marijuana, methadone, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (for example, oxycodone, 
hydrocodone), phencyclidine (PCP) , or alcohol in any form . 
• On days when you did not use drugs  or alcohol , you should write a “0” in the  box. 
• On days when you did use drugs  or alcohol , you should put a “” in the  box for drugs or alcohol . 
 
It’s important that something is written for every  day for both drugs and alcohol , even if it is a “0”.  
 
 YOUR BEST ESTIMATE  
• We realize it isn’t easy to recall things with 100%  accuracy.  
• If you are not sure  whether  you used  a certain  drug  or alcohol  on a Thursday or a Friday  of a certain  week,  give it  your 
best guess ! The goal is to get a pi[INVESTIGATOR_559501].  
 
 HELPFUL HINTS  
• Holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas are marked on the calendar to help you better recall your  
use. Also, think about whether you used drugs  or alcohol  on personal holidays and events such as 
birthdays, vacations, or  parties.  
• If you have regular drug or alcohol use patterns you can use these to help you recall your use. For 
example, you  may have weekend/weekday changes in your drug use or your drug use may be 
different depending where you are or whom you are  with.  
 
 COMPLETING THE CALENDAR  
• A blank calendar is attached. Each day should contain a "0" for no drug use or a " " for drug  and alcohol use . 
• The time period we are talking about on the calendar  is 
from ___________________ to ___________________ .  
• In estimating your drug use, be as accurate as  possible.

Rationale for this Study  
Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) arise from post thymic lymphocytes, representing non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the 
western populations. Based on  immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], molecular, clinical and pathologic  features, there are about 22 different 
subtypes of P TCL that are broadly classified into nodal, extranodal, leukemic variant and cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) 
based on th e site of origin of the disease. Approximately 5,[ADDRESS_950615] a dismal prognosis with a 5 year survival of less than 30% with the exception of ALK+ ALCL . 
The Bcl-[ADDRESS_950616] . Bcl-2 over-expression is a major contributor 
to the pathogenesis of some types of lymphoid malignancies and has been extensively studied in B cell lymphomas, including CLL 
and DLBCL. In studies of T -cell lymphoma at City of Hope , Bcl -2 has been found to be expressed in 52 -76% of cases of PTCL and 
25% of CTCL . So far there is no publ ished data regarding the use of Bcl -2 inhibitors in the treatment of peripheral T cell lymphomas 
and cutaneous T cell lymphomas . 
Venetoclax (also known as ABT -199) is a novel, orally available, small molecule Bcl -2 family protein inhibitor that binds with high 
affinity to Bcl -2 and with lower affinity to other Bcl -2 family proteins such as Bcl -xL and Bcl-w. There is currently clinical experience 
with venetoclax in CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia and B -cell NHL. In the Phase 1 study of venetoclax in diffuse l arge B-cell 
lymphoma and follicular lymphoma the overall response rate was 15%  and 34%  with a median duration of response of 3.3 months  
and 10 months, respectively.  In diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, there is an ongoing trial evaluating the combination of venetoclax 
with rituximab or obinutuzumab plus CHOP ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  We hypothesize that interference of BCL2 will lead to antitumor 
activity in mature T-cell lymphomas.  
Experience with the first 6 patients on the venetoclax monotherapy was that only 2 patients  were able to complete the 
unacceptable toxicity evaluation  period (2 cycles) . PTCL are aggressive lymphomas , and during the first version of the protocol 
with a weekly ramp up it became eviden t that most patients progressed before the completion of C1.  Three patients were 
enrolled on the weekly ramp up , two of them had clinical PD/PD after 1 cycle of therapy and terminated treatment without 
unacceptable toxicities; they had to be replaced.  The 3rd patient completed [ADDRESS_950617] been cond ucted 
in aggressive heamtological malignancies including AML [1] where a more rapid ramp up was studied and felt to be sa fe. Once the 
protocol was modified, [ADDRESS_950618] 
cycle without unacceptble toxicities and had to be replaced,  due to disease progression (n=1) or due to neutropenia (n=1, 
several grade 2 and 3 neutropenia events but grade 3 only lasted for a day). The 3rd patient completed 2 cycles without 
unacceptable toxicities . Since it remains a promising strategy to be studied in PTCL, we propose to  evaluate venetoclax in

Page 5 of 94 combination w ith another active agent, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) romidepsin. Romidepsin has regulatory 
approval for use as a single agent in relapsed CTCL and PTCL, and has been shown in vitro and in primary patient samples to a ct 
synergistically with v enetoclax via effects on Bcl -2 family proteins to increase antineoplastic efficacy. Therefore it is hoped that 
addition of romidepsin will slow disease progression, allow patients to complete the unacceptable toxicity  period in the Safety 
Lead-in portion o f the trial and then enable accrual and evaluation on the phase 2 portion.  
Objectives  
Primary Objectives  
Safety Lead-in: 
 To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of venetoclax  with romidepsin , including the dose ramp-up, in 
adults with relapsed or refractory mature T -cell lymphoma.  
Phase 2: 
 To estimate the efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_147447] [ ORR]) of venetoclax  with romidepsin  in patients with 
relapsed or refractory mature T -cell lymphoma.  
Phase 2 Secondar y Objectives 
 To evaluate the complete response rate, duration of response, time to response, overall survival and progression free 
survival associated with venetoclax  and romidepsin in relapsed/refractory mature T -cell lymphoma.  
 To further characterize the  safety and toxicities of venetoclax and romidepsin combination in relapsed/refracto ry 
mature T-cell lymphoma.  
Exploratory Objective 
 BCL2 protein expression in baseline trea tment tumor samples and correlation with response  
 To determine changes in Bcl -[ADDRESS_950619] the safety and efficacy of  venetoclax  with romidepsin  
for the treatment mature T -cell lymphoma .

Statistical Considerations  
Safety Lead-in 
Up to 6 patients may be enrolled under a “3+3” design at  the proposed dose (maximum dose of 800 mg/day with a 1 -week dose 
ramp up schedule). Unacceptable toxicities will be evaluated during the first 2 cycles of therapy. This will ensure monitorin g of 
participants during the ramp -up period (Cycle 1 , Days 1-8) and while participants are on steady- state dose ( Cycle 1 Days 8- 28, 
Cycle 2). Initially up to 3 patients can be enrolled and treated. After 3 patients are treated and evaluated for unacceptable  
toxicities, if 0/[ADDRESS_950621] 2 cycles, up to 3 additional patients will  be 
enrolled and treated to bring the total number of patients treated to 6. If ≤1/[ADDRESS_950622] 2 cycles, the proposed treatment dose/schedule will be considered tolerable and be used for the subsequent Phase 2 
response evaluation. If ≥2/3 (after the initial 3) or ≥2/6 (after the total 6 in 2 cohorts) patients experience unacceptable toxicities 
during the first 2 cycles, the accrual will be suspended and the study will be amended.   
Phase 2 
The primary endpoint for Phase 2 is ORR after 2 cycles  of treatment . The response evaluation will be based on a Si mon’s Two -
Stage Optimal design t o distinguish a promising 30% response rate (alternative hypothesis) from a disappointing rate (null 
hypothesis) of 10%, at a one -sided type I error of 10% and a power of 80%. In the first stage, 7 evaluable subjects will be accrued. 
If there is 0 response among the 7, the study accrual will be suspended. If there are 1 or more responses among the 7, the study 
will remain open to accrue a total of 18 evaluable patients. Observing 4 or more responses among 18 evaluable patients will

Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_700344] (TLS)  
The study will implement accrual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_700345]. When a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16510], t he 
study PMT will review and assess the safety of the trial and s ubmit a report to the COH DSMC.  The COH DSMC will review for 
approval any decision to continue or permanently suspend accrual to the trial.  
 Clinical TLS Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]  
−  Study accrual will be suspended when the first incidence of clinical TLS is reported.   
 Laboratory TLS Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_700346] T LS will be monitored with 12% being the benchmark based on IB. Operationally, the study 
accrual will be suspended if:  
−  [ADDRESS_950624] been ≤5 patients treated  
−  [ADDRESS_950625] been ≤14 patients treated  
−  3 patients experience laboratory TLS regardless of the number of patients treated  
The rule is derived based on a <50% probability of the rule being triggered when the true laboratory TLS incidence is ≤12% .

2.1  Introduction/Rationale for Development  
2.1.1  Burden of disease  
Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) arise from post thymic lymphocytes, representing non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) in the western populations. Approximately 5,000 new cases of PTCL are diagnosed 
annually in the US [ 2]. Based on immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], molecular, clinical and pathologic  feat ures, there 
are about 22 different subtypes of PTCL that are broadly classified into nodal, extranodal, leukemic variant 
and cutaneous T cell lymphomas ( CTCL) based on the site of origin of the disease [ 3, 4]. In North America, 
the most common subtypes are PTCL -not otherwise specified, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and 
angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) [5] .  
Most PTCL cases have a dismal prognosis with a 5 year survival of less than 30% with the exception of 
ALK+ ALCL. Anthracycline based combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_700352] u sed for 
PTCL but primary response rate is less than 60% and most patients relapse after initial therapy  [5]. There 
are now 4 FDA approved agents ( Table 2.1.1 ) for the treatment of PTCL in the relapsed setting in the US 
but none of them are curat ive. Other than  ALCL most patients with PTCL are in dire need for new and 
improved therapeutic options. Currently there are many agents that are being evaluated for relapsed and refractory PTCL.

Chidamide [10] 28/[ADDRESS_950637] identified in follicular lymphoma where the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation results in significant over- expression of the protein in B -cells. The Bcl -2 family of genes encodes a family of closely  
related proteins that possess either pro -apoptotic or anti- apoptotic activity and share up to f our Bcl-2 
Homology (BH) domains [ 11-14]. Bcl-2 over-expression is a major contributor to the pathogenes is of some 
types of lymphoid malignancies and has been extensively studied in B cell lymphomas, including CLL and 
DLBCL. Bcl -2 is also over- expressed in acute and chronic leukemias.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
is a genetic disease where the microRN As miR15a and miR16 -1 that negatively regulate the transcription 
of Bcl-2 are deleted or down -regulated, resulting in u ncontrolled expression of Bcl -2 [14]. 
Bcl-2 over-expression has been found to be associated with progression of various B cell lymphoid 
malignancies and is targetable with selective anti-  BCL2 therapy including Venetoclax resulting in 
meaningful  clinical responses in CLL and other B cell malignancies [ 15]. Similar studies have demonstrated 
over-expression of Bcl -2 in cases of CTCL  [16]. Using immunohistochemical methods on tissue samples

Page 15 of 94 and a 10% cut off, Bcl- 2 was detected in 46% of cases in PTCL along with other members of the Bcl -2 family 
[17]. The expression pattern of the BCL family of pr oteins was variable, with a distinct pattern seen in only 
Alk +ALCL and EATCL that were Bcl- 2 negative and MCL -1 positive. Further studies conducted using a 
TUNEL assay and proliferation index revealed that the Bcl -2 family protein levels correlated with apoptotic 
rates and proliferation index. It was hypothesized that over- expression of these proteins may explain the 
poor response of the many types of PTCL to chemotherapy. A later study attempted to  correlate the 
expression of Bcl -2, Bax and p53 with progr ession of PTCL using paraffin -embedded specimens from 
patients [18]. These included CTCL. In this study, Bcl -2 over-expression was strongly associated with 
advanced stage and a high IPI [INVESTIGATOR_632596]. Within the groups that over -expressed BcL2, p53 over -expression 
was associated with poor survival. The 3 year OS was 82% for Bcl- 2+/p53- cases and only  32% for Bcl -
2+/p53+ cases, indicating that Bcl- 2 over expression seemed to correlate with progression of PTCL through 
a p53-dependent pathway3. In studies of T -cell lymphoma at City of Hope , Bcl- 2 has been found to be 
expressed in 52 -76% of cases of PTCL  and 25% of CTCL [19, 20]  (unpublished data from Joo Song, City of 
Hope). Hence, there is strong rationale to consider that interference of the Bcl -[ADDRESS_950638] in PTCL and 
CTCL may be a favorable anti lymphoma target. So far there is no published data regarding the use of Bcl-
2 inhibitors in the treatment of peripheral T cell lymphomas  and cutaneous T cell lymphomas. We 
hypothesize that interference of BCL2  will lead to antitumor activity in mature T-cell lymphomas.  
2.3  Venetoclax  
Venetoclax (also known as ABT -199) is a novel, orally available, small molecule Bcl- 2 family protein 
inhibitor that binds with high affinity (Ki < 0.010 nM) to Bcl- 2 and with lower affinity to other Bcl- 2 family 
proteins such as B cl-xL and Bcl-w (> 4,000 -fold and > 2,000 - to > 20,000- fold lower affinity than to Bcl -2, 
respectively) [21]. Selective inhibition by [CONTACT_700386] -2 signaling and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_700354]- 2-dependent human tumor cell lines [22]. Importantly, venetoclax 
inhibition of Bcl- 2 is independent of p53 activity.  
Venetoclax  has been FDA approved for  patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p 
deletion, as detected by [CONTACT_129324], who have received at least one prior therapy .  
2.3.1  Pre-clinical experience  
Previous agents targeting Bcl -2 were non-specific and had inhibitory effects on BCL -XL  as well as BCL -w 
that resulted in significant clinical thrombocytopenia due to the role of  BCL-XL   in platelet survival  [23]. 
This led to the development of Venetoclax or ABT- 199 which has specific inhibition of Bcl -2 with platelet 
sparing effects with sub -nanomolar affinity to Bcl -2 (Ki < 0.010nM) and anti - tumor activity a gains NHL, 
CLL and acute leukemia in vitro  [21, 24, 25]. Multiple experiments demonstrate that venetoclax acts to 
induce apoptosis. As expected, venetoclax was ineffective against murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 
lacking Bax and Bak, essential mediators of the intrinsic apoptosis program.  However, in the Bcl- 2-
dependent ALL cell line RS 4;11, venetoclax rapi[INVESTIGATOR_700355], including cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and the externalization of phosphatidylserine.  
Venetoclax exhibited potent activity against patient -derived tumor cells treated ex vivo killing CLL cells 
with an average EC50 of 6.0 nM (N = 35) 
and AML cells with a median IC50 of 10 to 20 nM (N = 57). 
Venetoclax was equally potent against the subset of CLL samples bearing the high -risk 17p del, with an 
average EC50 of 0.008 µM (N = 5), indicating that venetoclax may hav e a significant utility in treating 
patients with this high -risk lesion. 
Venetoclax also demonstrated cell killing activity against lymphoma and 
leukemia cell lines including B- cell FLs, MCLs, DLBCLs, AMLs, ALLs, and MMs. 
Venetoclax was especially 
potent against cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl- 2. 
The majority of sensitive FL and DLBCL cell lines

Page 16 of 94 were positive for the t(14;18) chromosome translocation that drives high level expression of Bcl -2 from 
the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer.  Bcl -2 levels and the t(14;18) chromosome translocation thus 
represent potential predictive biomarkers for sensitivity to venetoclax. Venetoclax also demonstrated 
potent killing of MM cell lines and primary tumor samples bearing the t(11;14) translocation [26]. 
These 
cells tended to express high levels of Bcl -[ADDRESS_950639] aggressive Myc positive lymphoma as well as acute leukemia [27, 28]. 
2.3.2  Clinical experience  
As of version 11  of the venetoclax Investigator's Brochure [ 29] a total of [ADDRESS_950640] 
1 dose of venetoclax in [COMPANY_013] studies and had data available as of 28 November 201 8. Among these 2939 
subjects, 1313 subjects had CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL), 570  subjects had non -Hodgkin's 
lymphoma  (NHL), 218 subjects had multiple myeloma (MM), 361  had acute myeloid leukemia ( AML), 59 
subjects had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 20 subjects had acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and [ADDRESS_950641] common adverse events (incidence > 20%) reported for all subjects in monotherapy studies were nausea, diarrhea, neutropenia,  anemia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia . Infections, including 
serious infections, although also common with the underlying malignancies, have been reported with 
venetoclax treatment and their incidence is higher with combination treatments. The most common 
adverse events that were grade 3 and above were neutropenia ( 31.0%) and anemia (1 3.8%). The most 
common serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia and malignant neoplasm progression (5.7% 
each). The most common treatment emergent adverse event that led to death was malignant neoplasm 
progression (2.1%). 
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an important risk of Bcl -[ADDRESS_950642] in CLL and MCL . As a 
result of on -target effects, the potential for TLS with venetoclax was identified early in the program when 
the initial 3 subjects with CLL/SLL  received starting doses of 100  mg or 200 mg and experienced TLS, which 
was reported as an adverse event for each. Subsequently, 2 fatal events in the setting of TLS and another event of clinical TLS in subjects with CLL/SLL occurred in December 2012. Afte r comprehensive review of 
all safety data available from studies with venetoclax, starting from May 2013, a revised dosing regimen with a dose -titration phase of 4 to 5 weeks and enhanced TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures were 
implemented in all CLL studies. In May 2014, a subsequent analysis of data from subjects with CLL/SLL 
following the implementation of prophylaxis measures, who completed monotherapy, indicated a marked 
reduction in severity and frequency of TLS when compared to the previous anal ysis. None of the subjects 
experienced any serious (including fatal) or non -serious events of clinical TLS or laboratory TLS or had 
study treatment discontinued because of TLS. Overall, the clinical data strongly support that the risk of TLS with venetocla x in CLL/SLL subjects is highest when initiating venetoclax dosing (5 week dose titration 
phase), as well as being greater in subjects with a large tumor burden. Currently, since May 2014, a more personalized approach for prophylaxis and monitoring measure s, where subjects with low tumor burden 
could receive venetoclax on an out -patient basis, has been implemented with no clinical TLS [ 30]. 
More specifically, in the Phase 1 study of venetoclax in CLL, the recommended Phase 2 dose (R2PD) of 
venetoclax was 400 mg per day. Given the risk of tumor lysis, dosing was ramped up weekly for 5 weeks 
(20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg). Among the 116  patients who received venetoclax on this study, 
the overall response rate was 79%, and complete remissions occurred in 20% of patients. The 15 month 
estimate for progression -free survival for those dosed at 400 mg was 69% [31]. Clinical tumor lysis

Page 17 of 94 syndrome did not occur in any of th e 60 patients treated in the expansion cohort of this study but did 
occur in 3 of the 56 patients treated in the Phase 1 portion of the study. There was one death due to 
tumor lysis in the dose escalation portion of the study.  
In the Phase 1  study of venetoclax in diffuse large B- cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, the RP2D 
dose was 1200 mg. In this study, there were two events of laboratory tumor lysis syndrome, but no 
patients had clinical tumor lysis. Therefore, in the expansion cohort portion for this study, dosing was ramped up weekly over 3 weeks (400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg). Of the 41 patients with diffuse large B -cell 
lymphoma, the overall response rate was 15% with a median duration of response of 3.3 months. Among the 29 patients with follicular lymphoma, the overall response rate was 34%, and the median duration of response was [ADDRESS_950643] common adverse events were diarrhea (44%), fatigue (44%), nausea 
(33%), and vomiting (23%). Serious adverse events included hyponatremia ( 4%), dehydration (3%), 
diarrhea (3%) , and febrile neutropenia (3%) [ 15, 32]. In diffuse large B- cell lymphoma, there is an ongoing 
trial evaluating the combination of venetoclax with rituximab or obin utuzumab plus CHOP  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . 
2.4  HDAC inhibition in mature  T cell lymphomas  
Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes t hat catalyze t he removal or acetyl groups from the lysine 
residues of various proteins, including histones and transcription factors. The transcription of genes is 
partially regulated by [CONTACT_700387]. The core nucleosomal histones are the most widely studied of the proteins that become acetylated following inhibition of HDAC activity. [33] In some 
cancer cells there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic transcription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. Hypoacetylation of histone is 
associated with a condensed chromatin structure and repression of gene transcription.  
Inhibition of HDAC activity allows for the accumulation of acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues 
resulting in an open chromatin structure and transcription activation. HDAC inhibitors can induce tumor cell growth arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in animals. [34, 35] HDAC 
inhibitors as a class appear to have significant activity in T -cell lymphomas for reasons that are not clearly 
understood. HDAC inhibito rs work through several different mechanisms including alteration in the 
expression of genes that regulate cell cycle, acetylation of non -histone proteins that may impair their 
function to influence cell growth and survival, and by [CONTACT_700388]. [36] 
Attempts at understanding the mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors have involved gene expression profiling 
on paired tissue samples both pre - and post-treatment that have shown only 5 -10% of the genome can 
be affected. As many genes are unregulated as are down regulated following treatment with most HDAC 
inhibitors. The genes that were consistently affected included genes that alter cell cycle (CCND1, IGF1), 
apoptosis (septin10, TEF, SORBBS2), angiogenesis (GUCY1A1, ANGPT1), and immune modulation (LAIR1). 
[37] QT-PCR was used to confirm that the findings on the gene array anal ysis were indeed biologically 
accurate, with a strong correlation between gene array and the PCR data. Tumor tissue specimens treated 
with various HDAC inhibitors have shown an increase in histone acetylation, decreased vascularity, and 
translocation of nu clear proteins like STAT- s which is associated with inactivation. [38] 
2.5  Romidepsin  
Romidepsin (also known as Istodax®, FK228) is a HDAC inhibitor commercially available from Celgene. It is a unique HDAC inhibitor as it is a prodrug. Upon entering cells romidep sin is reduced to an active 
compound, capable of preferentially interacting with zinc in the active site of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Class I). [39] Romidepsin currently has FDA approval for patients with c utaneous T -cell lymphomas (CTCL)

assessed for the treatment of a variety of malignant and inflammatory diseases.  
2.5.[ADDRESS_950645] provided the safety profile and dosing schedule. [ 40, 41] Romidepsin doses 
ranging from 1.0 to 24.9 mg/m2 administered intravenously over [ADDRESS_950646] been investigated in 
treatment of advanced cancers. [42] A more standardized regimen has been defined as 14  mg/m2 
intravenously over a 4 hour period on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle. [ 7] The major hematologic 
toxicity includes anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Other common adverse 
events include gastrointestinal symptoms, constitutional symptoms, and dysgeusia. In addition, it was 
found that romidepsin may cause QTc prolongation/ECG changes, however, this may be the result of a 
drug:drug interaction with select antiemetics. Based on on -clinical findings, male and female fertility may 
be compromised by [CONTACT_700389].  
The use of r omidepsin is best established in CTCL. A phase 2 trial with romidepsin in relapsed CTCL showed 
single agent activity in patients that previously had been heavily pretreated with a median of 4 prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. [43] A total of 7 1 patients were treated with an overall response rate (ORR) of 34% including 4 
patients with complete response. The median duration of response (DOR) was 13.7 months. This trial and 
a registration directed trial by [CONTACT_700390], previous owne rs of romidepsin, led to full 
regulatory approval by [CONTACT_700391]. A phase 2 trial of romidepsin in patients with heavily treated relapsed/refractory PTCL demonstrated an ORR of 25% with median DOR lasting a somewhat remarkable 17 months. [7] The treatment regimen was romidepsin administered as a 
4-hour infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle with a dose of 1 4 mg/m
2. Based on this trial, 
romidepsin gained FDA approval in 2011 for used in relapsed/refractory PTCL.

Bid.[44] These proteins  show tumor -suppressor function in certain contexts and inactivating mutations or 
loss of expression in human cancer samples have been reported. T ranscriptional activation of the 
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family BH3-only genes BIM , BMF, and NOXA is the apparent mec hanism of HDACi-
induced apoptosis . Selective knockdown of the three corresponding proteins rescued cells from 
vorinostat -induced apoptosis. Combined inhibition of Bc L2 members and HDAC is has shown synergistic 
effects in CTCL and other malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma and glioblastoma : vorinostat 
enhanced the activity of the BH3 -mimetic ABT -263 (navitoclax)  in MCL cells, leading to synergistic 
apoptosis induction .[45] Notably, overexpression of the prosurvival protein Bcl- 2, which inhibits activation 
of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, completely suppressed the apoptotic and therapeutic activities o f

Higher sensitivity to venetoclax that correlates with higher levels of BcL -2 expression and mRNA has been 
seen in CTCL patient samples in vitro ,[48] similar to observations  in CLL. In addition, when these p atient

venetoclax with romidepsin  for the treatment of relapsed/refractory  mature T-cell lymphoma.  
Eligibility 
Eligible patients will be adults with histologically  confirmed peripheral T -cell lymphoma as defined per the 
WHO criteria 2016 [49]. Eligible patients must be naïve to prior Bcl -[ADDRESS_950649] that B- cell NHL patients can tolerate up to 1200 
mg/day venetoclax [15, 32]. However, due to biologic differences in T cell and B cell lymphomas  and 
aggressive nature of T -cell disease , a maximum dose of 800 mg/day  will be tested  in this study . 
Romidepsin dosing will be according to the label.  
On-target effect of either romidepsin or venetoclax coul d lead to rapid cell death and pose a risk of TLS . 
Based on prior clinical experience with the agent , a ramp up dosing schedule will be implemented during 
Cycle 1. The venetoclax dose will be ramped up over 7 days , in line with current practice for AML [ 30]. 
Once the safety and tolerability of the proposed dose  combination  and schedule is established  after the 
safety lead -in, additional patients will be enrolled and treated for the Phase 2 response evaluation  using 
the same dose  combination  and schedule ( which includes  the ramp-up in Cycle 1) . 
Participants will continue with treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or completion 
of 26 cycles (~24 months) of therapy , whichever comes first. If a patient is still benefiting from treatment 
at the completion of  26 cycles of therapy, we will consider amending the study to extend the duratio n of 
therapy for that particular patient.  
Dose and Schedule:  
During Cycle 1, p articipants will take venetoclax 20 mg/day on Day 1, 50 mg/day on Day 2, 100 mg/day on 
Day 3, 200 mg/day on Day  4, 400 mg/day on Day 5, and 800 mg/day on Days 6-7 in the ramp -up phase 
and 800 mg/day on Days 8- 28. Romidepsin 14 mg/m2 will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of the  28-
day cycle.  
During Cycle 2+, participants will take 800 mg/day  venetoclax.  Romidepsin 14 mg/m2 will be administered 
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of e ach 28-day cycle.  
Safety Lead-in 
During the safety -lead in, up to 6 evaluable participants will be enrolled using a 3+3 design.  
In the event the proposed combination of venetoclax  (20-800 mg/day ) with romidepsin  is not tolerable 
(2+ patients with  unacceptable toxicity  in ≤ 6 evaluable participants), the accrual will be suspended and 
the study will be amended.  
Unacceptable toxicities will be evaluated during the first 2 cycles of therapy . This will ensure monitoring 
of participants during the ramp -up period (Cycle 1) and while p articipants are on steady -state dose (Cycle

Page 20 of 94 2). Unacceptable toxicities will focus on commonly observed toxicities for venetoclax such as ne utropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, blood chemistries  and tumor lysis syndrome . 
Phase 2 
Once the Safety Lead -in is completed  and the proposed dose combination and schedule  (including ramp -
up) is confirmed safe and tolerable , additional patien ts will be enrolled and treated  for the Phase 2 
response evaluation. The Phase 2 portion will utilize  a Simon’s two -stage optimal design. Patients enrolled 
during the Safety Lead -in will be included in the Phase [ADDRESS_950650]-dose monitoring during the ramp-up stage (see Section 5.10.2) . Patients will be monitored for 
TLS on an outpatient basis for  the first 8 days of treatment.  
Response  
PTCL specific response assessment criteria per Lugano Classification will be used for this study [ 50]; these 
criteria incorporate PET for response assessment. PTCL is considered [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)  avid 
[51, 52] and PET-CT is recommended for staging of routinely FDG- avid histologies [ 50]. CT is preferred for 
low or variable FDG avidity.  
Radiographic imaging will occur every [ADDRESS_950651].  Additionally, these studies will explore  response to therapy and toxicity base d on the patient’s 
BCL-2 status.

5.0  TREATMENT PROGRAM  
5.1  Treatment Program Overview  
This is a multi- center, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 trial of venetoclax with romidepsin for patients with 
relapsed/refractory mature T-cell lymphoma . 
The study consists of a Safety Lead -in stage to evaluate safety/tolerability and a Phase 2 stage to evaluate 
anti-tumor activity in the study population  (Section 5.3 ). Participants will receive up to [ADDRESS_950664].  If a patient is still benefiting from 
treatment at the completion of  26 cycles of therapy, we will consider amending the study to extend the 
duration of t herapy for that particular patient.  
During Cycle 1 , all participants  will be monitored closely  for tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS, Section 5.9.2). 
Participants who discontinue protocol therapy will undergo follow -up (see Section 5.8). Windows for all 
assessments and treatments are detailed in Section 10.0 . 
5.2  Treatment Cycle Definition  
The treatment cycle will be a fixed 28 days  (Note: exceptions due to unusual operational considerations 
may be permitted as described in Section 6.2 ).  
The cycle day count and cycle count will continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a hold in venetoclax or romidepsin 
administration due to toxici ties (See Section 6.2 ) - i.e. a cycle may initiate even if either drug is being held .

1 Days 8-28 and Cycle 2+ Days 1 -28, participants will continue at the maximum dose (Figure 5.3 ) of 
venetoclax. Romidepsin 14 mg/m2 will be administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.  
Figure 5.3. Dosing Schedule  
 
5.3.1  Safety Lead -in 
During the safety -lead in, 6 evaluable participants will be enrolled using a 3+[ADDRESS_950667] 2 cycles of therapy . 
In the event the proposed dose (20-800 mg/day)  of venetoclax plus romidepsin  is not tolerable ( 2+ 
participants with  unacceptable toxicity  in ≤ 6 evaluable participants), the accrual will be suspended and 
the study will be amended.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_950668] initiate TLS prophylaxis prior to initiating ve netoclax (refer to  Table 5.9.1 ). Delay 
initiating Cycle 1 Day 1 dose if the participant is experiencing laboratory TLS (see Appendix B ).

aseptic technique. Before intravenous infusion, further dilute the romidepsin in 500m L 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP.  
Infuse over 4 hours. Patients  will receive romidepsin (at a dose of either 14 or 12  mg/m2 – see Section 7.2 
for details) IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. On these days it does not matter whether venetoclax is given before or after the romidepsin infusion.  
The diluted solution is compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene (PE) infusion bags as well as glass bottles. Romidepsin is stable for 24 hours at room temperature after reconstitution per package insert.   
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration, whenever solution and container permit.  
5.5  Assessments and Special Monitoring  
Section 10.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed. It may be necessary to perform study 
procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Note the following:

5.6  Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
Participants will receive protocol therapy until one of the below criteria are met:  
o  Disease progression  
o  Completed 26 cycles (~24 months) of  protocol therapy 
o  Participant is deemed intolerant to protocol therapy because of toxicity, despi[INVESTIGATOR_58349]/ delay  
o  General or specific changes in the patient's condition which render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
o  Withdrawal of consent for further protocol therapy (see Section 16.5 ) 
Once participants meet criteria for removal from protocol therapy, the participant should then proceed to End of Treatment assessments.  If a patient is still benefiting from treatment at the completion of  26 
cycles of therapy, we will consider amending the study to extend the duration of therapy for that particular patient.  
Documentation of the reason  for discontinuing protocol therapy and the date effective should be made 
in the source documentation  and appropriate eCRF. The COH DCC should be promptly notified of the 
change in participant status.  
5.7  Follow -Up 
Following completion of protocol therapy, all participants will enter follow -up for up to 24 months after 
ending protocol treatment.  This is comprised of:  
o  Follow -up for safety - All participants will be followed until resolution or stabilization of 
reportable AEs occurring during protocol therapy or starting within [ADDRESS_950675]  disease

o  For supportive care guidelines see Section 5. 9. 
o  Venetoclax doses missed for toxicity will not be made up . 
o  Romidepsi n doses missed for toxicity will not be made up.  
o  Permanently discontinue protocol therapy  if:  
  Participant requires a dose reduction and is  already on 100 mg/day of venetoclax  
  Participant requires a dose reduction and is already on 10 mg/m2 romidepsin   
  Unable to resume treatment within [ADDRESS_950683] dose of venetoclax  
o  If the venetoclax dose was reduced during Cycle 1, intra-patient daily re-escalation to steady -
state venetoclax dose may be permitted in the absence of a recurrence of the toxicity that 
led to the reduction following consultation with the Study PI.  
o  The initiation of a new cycle may be delayed for up to 7 days with written approval from the 
Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_700362] (e.g. planned vacation by [CONTACT_3445], lack of transportation etc.).*  
*If prior approval from the Study PI [CONTACT_230418], then these modifications will not be considered a protocol deviation. The Study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_700363] t of 
these determinations on the study design, objectives and endpoints or risk to participants. If 
any modifications to the treatment plan might affect the study design, objectives, and 
endpoints, or impact the risk of participants, a single subject excep tion will be sought by [CONTACT_5040].  If the treating investigator is the Study PI , the determination and the rationale for the 
determination will clearly be documented in the source document(s).

Page 40 of 94 8.0  AGENT INFORMATION  
8.1  Venetoclax  
Venetoclax  has been FDA approved for  patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p 
deletion, as detected by [CONTACT_129324], who have received at least one prior therapy .  
For additional information refer to the IB.

8.1.2  Description  
Structural Formula:  
 
Molecular Formula: C45H50ClN7O7S 
Molecular Weight:  868.44 kDa 
8.1.3  Mechanism of Action  
Venetoclax is a novel, orally available small molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that binds w ith > 500-
fold higher affinity to Bcl-2 and with lower affinity to other Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl- XL and Bcl -w. 
Overexpression of anti -apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is associated with increased resistance to 
chemotherapy, and antagonism of the action of these proteins might enhance response to such therapy 
and overcome resistance.  Anti -apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are associated with tumor initiation, 
disease progression, and drug resistance, making them compelling targets for antitumor therapy .  
8.1.4  Pharmacokinetics  
Half-life: ~26 hrs

8.2.3  Mechanism of Action  
Romidepsin is a unique bicyclic depsipeptide originally isolated from Chromobacterium violaceum  strain 
968. Romidepsin is an antineoplastic agent that has been identified as a novel HDAC inhibitor. Romidepsin 
has been shown to induce hyperacetylation of histones and other nonhistone protein species resulting in a variety of phenotypic changes, induc tion of the upregulation of gene transcription, G1 and G2/M arrest 
of the cell cycle, morphological reversion of transformed cells, cell growth inhibition, apoptotic cell death, 
and inhibition of angiogenesis. In vitro, romidepsin causes the accumulation o f acetylated histones, and 
induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of some cancer cell lines with IC

Page 51 of 94 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Statistical  Design  
This is a multi- institution, single arm Phase 2 trial to evaluate the anti- tumor activity and safety/tolerability 
of venetoclax  with romidepsin  in patients with relapsed/refractory mature T -cell lymphoma. Patients will 
take oral v enetoclax daily and romidepsin on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle for up to 26 cycles (28- day 
cycle) Response will be assessed after every 2 cycles until disease relapse/progression. Patients will be 
followed for [ADDRESS_950695] 
6 patients enrolled on the study will be part of a Safety Lead -in to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
the proposed dose of venetoclax with romidepsin as described below in Section 12.1.1 . 
12.1.1  Safety Lead -In 
Prior to formally  initiating the Phase 2  response evaluation , a patient Safety Lead -in will be conducted to 
ensure the proposed treatment is tolerable . Up to 6 evaluable patients may be enrolled in two cohorts of 
3 patients each  at the proposed venetoclax dose (maximum dose of 800 mg/day with a 1-week dose ramp 
up schedule)  plus romidepsin  as outlined below . Initially up to 3 evaluable patients can be enrolled and 
treated. After 3 pati ents are treated and evaluated for unacceptable toxicities , if 0/[ADDRESS_950696] 2 cycles , up to 3 additional  patients will be 
enrolled and treated to bring the total number of patients treated to 6. If ≤1/[ADDRESS_950697] 2 cycles , the proposed treatment dose/schedule  
(including ramp -up) will be considered tolerable and be used for the subsequent Phase 2 response 
evaluation. At any time during the Safety Lead -in, if ≥[ADDRESS_950698] 2 cycles , the accrual will be suspended and the study will be amended. The unacceptable toxicities 
are defined in Section 11.2 . Unacceptable toxicities will be evaluated during the firs t 2 cycles of therapy 
to ensure monitoring of participants during the venetoclax ramp-up period (Cycle 1) and while participants 
are on steady -state venetoclax dose (Cycle 2). Patients inevaluable for unacceptable toxicities during the 
Safety Lead-in will be replaced (see below in Section 12.3 ). 
12.1.2  Phase 2 
The Phase 2 response evaluation will accrue a minimum of 7  evaluable patients and a maximum of 18  
evaluable patients. Patients enrolled during the Safety Lead -in period of the study (n=6) will be included 
in the Phase 2 response evaluation provided that they are evaluable for response  (defined in Section 12.3 ). 
The response evaluation will be based on a Simon’s T wo-Stage Optimal design  [53], to distinguish a 
promising 30% response rate (alternative hypothesis) from a disappointing rate (null hypothesis) of 10%, 
at a one-sided type I error of 10% and a power of 80%. In the first stage, [ADDRESS_950699] been observed, the study accrual will be terminated. On 
Venetoclax and Romidepsin for R/R Mature T -cell lymphoma  
City of Hope # :[ZIP_CODE] 
Version-Date 04-11/03/[ADDRESS_950700] one responder has been observed prior to enrolling the 7th patient for Phase II, 
then Phase II accrual will continue directly to Stage 2 without interruption.   
If no toxicity is noted at the proposed dose /schedule and there is no e fficacy either, the protocol may be 
amended after discussion with the industry partner  to increase the maximum dose of venetoclax up to 
1200 mg/day. 
12.2 Accrual and Expected Duration of Trial  
The expected sample size for the Phase 2 response evaluation is 18 patients evaluable for response  
(assuming the response evaluation passes the first stage ). Patients enrolled during the Safety Lead -in of 
the romidepsin/venetoclax combination will be inclu ded in the Phase [ADDRESS_950701] a response evaluation after 2 cycles . Therefore, the total sa mple 
size for the study including the Safety Lead -in is expected to be 18 evaluable patients. Assuming 
approximately 10% of the patients need to be replaced for safety lead -in or Phase 2 evaluation, the 
maximum sample size for evaluating the combination of venetoclax and romidepsin is 20 patients.  
The 6 patients enrolled on the previous versions of protocols with single agent venetoclax will be analyzed 
separately and excluded from the main analyses which evaluate the combination of venetoclax and 
romidepsin. Therefore, the maximum sample size of the study will be 26 accounting for these 6 prior 
enrollments.  
City of Hope saw ~160 PTCL patients per year, with ~30 new patients per year (mix of newly diagnosed 
and relapsed or refractory).  This will be a multicenter study with [ADDRESS_950702] a total accrual of 
1-2 patients per month across all sites. Therefore, accrual is expected to be completed in 24 months.  
Participant duration is planned for 4 years which includes  maximum time for treatment ( 24 months) and 
expected post- treatment follow -up (24 months). The estimated total study duration will be [ADDRESS_950703] patient.   
12.3  Evaluable Participants and Participant Replacement  
o  Evaluable fo r unacceptable toxicity during Safety L ead-in: Patients evaluable for 
unacceptable toxicity  (defined in Section 11.2 ) are: 
1)  Those who received at least 75% of the total  dose of each drug for  the first 2 cycles of 
therapy combined OR  
2)  Those who experience any unacceptable toxicity during the first 2 cycles  regardless of 
actual dose received.  
During safety lead -in, patients who are not evaluable for unacceptable toxicities will be replaced.  
o  Evaluable for response:  Patients evaluable for response are those who received at least [ADDRESS_950704] a response evaluation after 2 cycles. Subjects who 
terminate treatment prior to 2 cycles due to disease relapse/ progression or unacceptable 
toxicity will be considered evaluable for response and be considered non -responders. 
Patients who terminate prior to 2 cycles for other reasons will be inevaluable for response. 
Patients not evaluable for response will be replac ed.

using the product -limit method of Kaplan - Meier with the Greenwood estimator of standard error. Median 
progression -free survival and overall survival and their corresponding 95% CIs  will be estimated. O bserved 
toxicities will be summarized  as summary statistics  in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory

14.1 Definitions  
14.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing condition that occurs 
during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related to the protocol intervention.  
14.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any expected or unexpected adverse events that result in any of the following 
outcomes:  
•  Death 
•  Is life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred) 
•  Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
•  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
•  A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
•  Secondary malignancy*  
•  Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias of convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
*Modified from 21 CFR 312.32 
14.1.3  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  
An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three of the following 
criteria: 
1.  Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved research 
protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
2.  Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused by [CONTACT_177435], devices or procedures involved in the research); AND  
3.  Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.

grade), expectedness, and attribution of all adverse events.  
14.2.[ADDRESS_950714] recent version of CTCAE v. 5.0.  A copy of the scale can be found at NCI/ CTEP web site . The determination of 
severity for all other events not listed in the CTCAE v. 5.0 should be made by [CONTACT_700402] 1 to 5 as defined below:  
•  Grade 1 (mild) –  An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usu al activities of daily 
living. 
•  Grade 2 (moderate) –  An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
•  Grade 3 (severe) – An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject.  
•  Grade 4 (life threatening) –  An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an 
imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the subject to perform activities of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc).  
•  Grade 5 (fatal) – Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
14.2.2  Assessment of Attribution  
The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the study agent or study procedure.  
•  Unrelated – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the participant.  
•  Unlikely – The event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
•  Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_121641] r factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.

explained by [CONTACT_700403]’s condition, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant drugs, AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, improves 
upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478], or reappears on re -exposure.   
14.2.3  Assessment of Expectedness  
The following definitions will be used to determine the expectedness of the event:   
•  Unexpected – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure 
and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; is not consistent wi th the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event. *Modified from 21 CFR 
312.32 (a)

Page 77 of 94 APPENDIX C -1: PTCL -DISEASE PARAMETERS & METHODS OF EVALUATION AND RESPONSE  
Response will be assessed per Lugano Classification [ 50] 
Disease Parameters  
o  Measurable disease  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥15 mm (≥ 1.5 cm) by [CONTACT_13190] x -ray, CT scan, MRI, 
or calipers by [CONTACT_461]. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).  
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable  
 
o  Malignant lymph nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]). At baseline a nd in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and 
followed. 
 
o  Non-measurable disease  
Pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm [≥1 to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non -
measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleur al/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
  Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, 
by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
o  Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, bu t in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, 
the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion which can be m easured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the 
diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of 
the disease.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 78 of 94 o  Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of dis ease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target 
lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as close ly as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more 
than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during f ollow-up. Imaging- based evaluation is preferred to evaluation 
by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_119382]. 
o  Clinical lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion,  is recommended.  
 
o  Conventional CT and MRI  
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of th e scanning sequences 
used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with 
CT, the modality used at follow- up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions 
should be measured/assessed on the same pul se sequence. It is beyond the scope of the Lugano 
Classification [5] to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, 
and diseases. For this trial, MRI will not be used as standard imaging study for disease assessment.  
 
o  PET-CT at present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET- CT is not 
always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with Lugano Classification [5]. However, if the site 
can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time. Note, however , that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data 
which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.

Page 79 of 94 o  FDG-PET: While FDG- PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable 
to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can 
be identified according to the following algorithm:  
  Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based on a 
new lesion.  
  No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET at follow -
up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive FDG- PET at 
follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are 
needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD 
will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan). If the positi ve FDG-PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the 
anatomic images, this is not PD.  
  FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases 
where a resi dual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use 
of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and 
supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be 
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice 
that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

Measured dominant lesions:  
Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperit oneal areas.  
Non-nodal lesions include those in solid organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous 
lesions, or those noted on palpation.  
Nonmeasured lesions:  
Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly ass essable disease should be considered not 
measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively 
with measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot  be confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661]. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal 
sites (e.g., GI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete

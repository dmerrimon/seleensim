symptoms and on time to recovery post dialysis.  
Study Background  Subject s undergoing conventional intermittent thrice weekly hemodialysis using a Qd of 
500ml/min or higher report many inter and intra dialytic symptoms. Common symptoms 
include fatigue, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and insomnia.  
Subject s treated on the Tablo hemodialysis system  report ‘feeling better’. Tablo has a 
dialysate flow rate of 300 ml/min.  
Study Objective  The objecti ve of this study is to determine if Subject s who report dialysis symptoms while 
meeting adequacy (as determined by [CONTACT_739672]/V of 1.2 or greater) on thrice weekly dialysis or 
who have a recovery time of at least 4 hours when treated on a conventional, i.e. non 
Tablo, hemodialysis device feel better with a reduced dialysate flow rate of 300ml/min 
based on an assessment of time to recovery post dialysis and  Subject  reported symptoms 
via a modified weekly ESAS survey.  
Study Length  The study will last approximately [ADDRESS_1010709] of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant authorization statement.  
2. Subject is at least [ADDRESS_1010710] has end stage renal disease (ESRD) adequately treated with  thrice weekly 
dialysis.  
4. Subject is currently stable on dialysis for at least 3  months on a conventional dialysis 
machine and Qd of 500ml/min  or higher  with no change in the following dialysis 
prescri ption parameters over that time:  Qb, Qd, Dialyzer, Time.  
5. Subject has a baseline Kt/V of greater than 1.2.  
6. Subject has a stable vascular access.  
7. Subject reports time to recovery of more than [ADDRESS_1010711] 2 are rated as moderate (rating of 4 -6) or severe (r ating 
of 7-10). 
Exclusion Criteria  1. Subject is unable to complete the questionnaires.  
2. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant . 
3. Subject is scheduled for a change in modality or expected kidney transplant in the next

severity of intradialytic symptoms are associated with missed treatment s, shortened treatment time and delayed 
time to recovery after dialysis  (3,7,8).. Longer time to recovery has also been shown to be a simple, reproducible, 
tool associated with poor er HRQoL, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47144]  (3,4). Subject s treating on the Tablo system have 
previously reported feeling better when dialyzing thrice weekly with this device. The Tablo system utilizes a 
dialysate flow rate of 300ml/min to achieve the standard  adequacy target as defined as a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater 
(1,9). To better understand the feeling better effect on Tablo, this study was designed to determine if a decrease in 
dialysate flow rate on a conventional dialysis device produces a similar effect on  Subject  reported symptoms. This 
study assesses time to recovery as well as prevalence and severity of Subject  reported symptoms via a weekly 
modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment System when dialysate flow rate is decreased from 500ml/min or higher

requirements (21CFR).

50 subjects currently dialyzing on a  conventional dialysis machinev at a dialysate flow rate of 500ml/ min or higher

Enrolled subje cts will answer the question, “ How long does it take you to recover from a dialysis session?”  (TTR)  
along with a modifi ed ESAS at baseline and weekly. Subject s will be screened prior to entry into the study  and 
enrolled if time to recovery at baseline of >  [ADDRESS_1010718] 2 being described as moderate (rating of 4 -6) or severe (rating of 7 -10). 
Caregivers of screened Subject s meeting the study criteria will be given  a baseline KDQoL SF-[ADDRESS_1010719] ’s current state of health. Subject s enrolled will be randomized to two groups. Group [ADDRESS_1010720] 4 weeks of the study  at a Qd of 300ml/min, then for the last 4 weeks at a  Qd of 500ml/min. 
Group [ADDRESS_1010721] 4 weeks of the study  at a Qd of 500ml/min, then for the last 4 weeks at a Qd of 
300ml/min. At the end of each week, the Subject  will respond to the TTR question as well as the modified ESAS 
survey. Subje ct caregivers will complete the KDQoL at the end of each [ADDRESS_1010722]  caregiver responses to the survey tools as well as other outcome measures which may include 
but are not limited to, kinetics, laboratory  values, blood pressure measurement, intradialytic interventions, missed 
or shortened treatments, and/or changes to treatment parameters. The study will collect subject demographics 
and dialysis related medications.  The goal is to enroll at least 15 Subjec ts who report intradialytic symptoms as the 
ITT group for study analysis . 
6.1 Effort to Minimize Bias  
All eligible Subjects that , in the treating physician’s best medical judgement, meet the selection criteria  will be 
asked to participate in this study. Subjec ts will not be excluded based on gender, race, ethnicity or sexual 
orientation .

Treatment with a Qd of 300ml/min has been shown to be safe and effec tive in the treatment of ESRD subjects . It 
has also been demonstrated that dialysis at a Qd of 300ml/min can achieve the prescribed adequacy target of  a

symptoms with a conventional dialysis device at a Qd of 500 ml/min and a Qd of 300 ml/min. Only Subject s will be 
blinded to the dialysis device Qd.  
Subjects will be randomized to either arm at a 1:1 ratio using excel’s RANDBETWEEN function. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned a 0 or a 1. Subjects tha t are assigned ‘0’ will go to Group 1 , and subjects that a re assigned ‘1’ 
will go to Group [ADDRESS_1010724] s with a diagnosis of end stage renal disease (ESRD)  who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be

9 STUDY LIMITATIONS  
Limitation of this include its small size and in a single center. Additionally, every attempt has been made to remove 
any variables other than change in dialysis treatment device; however, Subjects  with ESRD have com plex medical 
histories and the effect of illness unrelated to ESRD (whether worsened or improved) was not taken into 
consideration. Socioeconomic factors that can affect a Subject’s  sense of wellbeing or any changes to these factors 
during the study  were also not accounted for.  
10 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
Risks: The risks to subjects participatin g in this study are minimal. Subjects  will be informed of the potential risk of 
an overall decrease in weekly Kt/V due the change in Qd.  A possible risk is expos ure of protected health 
information. Every effort will be made to maintain subject privacy.  
Benefits: The study will provide information on Subject  self-reported symptoms in the real world setting for 
subjects who dialyze thrice weekly with a dialysate flo w rate of 500ml/min who are changed to a dialysate flow

from the potential intervention. Subjects and their caregivers will be compensated for the ir time and effort to 
complete the surveys as requested.  
Participation in this study  is voluntary. Failure to participate in the study will not impact Subject  care.

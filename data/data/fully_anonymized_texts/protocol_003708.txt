1. Exclusion Criteria
The exclusion criteria related to liver function, which appears in the Synopsis as well as Sections 
5.3 and 7.5 has been changed to “Elevated liver function tests (determined by [CONTACT_42386], AST, GGT, or 
ALP > 2 x upper limit of normal, and/or total Bilirubin > upper limit of normal).”
2. Laboratory Abnormalities
Additional text has been added to Section 7.7 that reads as follows:
“Particular attention will be paid to determine the possibility of drug induced liver injury (DILI) 
as detailed in the FDA guidance document “Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation.” Liver tests (ALT, AST, ALP, and total Bilirubin) will be performed at enrollment and 
at days 7, 14, and 28 throughout the drug administration period.  For patients exhibiting signs of 
liver disease such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, or 
rash, extensive laboratory testing will be performed that includes above liver chemistries 
immediately. Otherwise, on routine weekly testing an increase of serum aminotransferase levels 
to >3x upper limit of normal would automatically trigger repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours of 
all four of the usual serum measures (ALT, AST, ALP, and total Bilirubin) to confirm the 
abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing. If symptoms and/or 
aminotransferase levels remain >3x upper limit of normal, the participant will be monitored more 
closely with lab schedule, in-person or virtual evaluation twice weekly or more. A thorough 
evaluation for additional causes of liver test anomalies will be conducted in consultation with 
Hepatology. A case report form page will be created and DSMB review triggered. Otherwise, 
discontinuation of treatment will be considered immediately if: 
•ALT or AST >8x upper limit of normal
•ALT or AST >5x upper limit of normal for more than 2 weeks 
•ALT or AST >3x upper limit of normal and total Bilirubin >2x upper limit of normal 
or INR >1.5 
•ALT or AST >3x upper limit of normal with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia 
(>5%).”

read:
“Serious Adverse Event: An untoward event or reaction that at any dose:
results in death
is life-threatening
results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]
results in permanent or significant disability or incapacity
requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage
results in congenital anomaly or birth defect
In addition, any important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.”

Objectives The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety, tolerability and treatment effect of the 
orally administered Caspase-1 inhibitor, belnacasan, for the treatment of patients with 
mild to moderate COVID-19 and to generate hypotheses for future trials.
Primary Objective : To determine the safety and tolerability  of belnacasan (VX-
765/RVT-201/MSR-001) administered orally for 28 days in subjects with mild to 
moderate COVID-19 as determined by [CONTACT_533381] .
Secondary Objective : To generate data on the treatment effect of belnacasan (VX-
765/RVT-201/MSR-001) administered orally for [ADDRESS_692471] size on outcomes in five areas: 
1. Clinical recovery and resolution of COVID-19 symptoms
2. Physical functions and parameters relevant to COVID-19
3. COVID-19 related deterioration and mortality 
4. WHO 9-point ordinal scale for clinical improvement
5. Surrogate markers of COVID-19-related inflammation and organ involvement
The hypothesized end result of treatment with belnacasan would be to reduce the 
symptomatic and clinical burden, length of disease course, and disease progression of 
COVID-19.
Number of 
SubjectsThe intent is to enroll 40 subjects to participate in a 1:[ADDRESS_692472] of care.

ConsiderationsStudy Populations:
Safety & Tolerability Population: All enrolled subjects who have received at least 
1 dose of IP (belnacasan or placebo) will be studied. Even if subjects have 
discontinued study treatment, as long as they maintain consent, they will continue 
to be in the study and included in analysis, i.e., their safety and tolerability 
information will continue to be collected for at least 60 days. 
Treatment Effect Evaluable Populations: All enrolled subjects who have received 
at least 1 dose of IP (belnacasan or placebo) will be studied. Even if subjects have 
discontinued study treatment, as long as they maintain consent, they will continue 
to be in the study and included in analysis, i.e., their outcome information will 
continue to be collected for at least 60 days.
Analysis Methods:
FDA Data Standard Guidelines will be followed. Continuous variables will be 
summarized using the number of observations, number of observations above the limit 
of quantification (if applicable), mean, standard deviation (SD) median, and range. 
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. 
Comparison of belnacasan and placebo groups will utilize Poisson regression for 
counts, Cox proportional hazards regression for time-to-event data and mixed effects 
models for continuous and categorical data obtained over study days.
Primary Safety and Tolerability Analysis:
All safety & tolerability analyses will be performed on the Safety Population. The 
safety data will be presented in individual listings and summary tables. Overall 
safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_533388] a 
grade [ADDRESS_692501] possibly related to belnacasan or should one or more subjects 
develop a ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_692502] Endpoint Analysis:
Event counts over [ADDRESS_692503] to change in continuous endpoints will be assessed by [CONTACT_533389]. Endpoint proportions of belnacasan and placebo 
groups will be assessed by [CONTACT_533390] (chi-square).   
Sample Size Considerations: 
As this is a proof-of-concept study, it will likely not be powered to detect belnacasan 
– placebo differences that are clinically meaningful. For example, the observed 
difference in endpoint rate ratios would need to be over 60% to achieve 80% power 
with an alpha error rate of 5% for [ADDRESS_692504] size to inform a larger trial where a more clinically 
meaningful difference can be detected.

Version 2.2 12/14/21 Page 18 of 661 BACKGROUND, STUDY RATIONALE AND DOSING RATIONALE 
1.1 Background and study rationale
For more than one year, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – an acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_533360]-CoV-2 that also has profound multi-systemic inflammatory involvement – has 
cost countless lives and livelihoods, especially for vulnerable populations with comorbidities 
characterized by [CONTACT_533391]. The full spectrum of COVID-[ADDRESS_692505] illness, to severe progressive pneumonia, 
multi-organ failure, and death [1]. Since its first discovery, the virus has continued to spread, even 
with attempted control with a variety of public health measures. There are more than 36 million 
cases in the [LOCATION_002], accounting for a quarter of the worlds documented cases, and over 
620,000 deaths [2]. In general, there is likely an underestimate of total cases since the prevalence 
of asymptomatic carriers is yet unknown. What is clear, is that individuals at highest risk are those 
over 65 years and / or those with concomitant chronic conditions most notably hypertension, 
diabetes, pre-diabetes, obesity, chronic cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_533361] [1, 3-6]. While there are racial disparities in the greater number of Black and Hispanic 
patients experiencing a more severe course there is no evidence that this is related to anything 
other than underlying comorbidities and socioeconomic factors, often limiting their ability to 
socially distance. 
There have been promising scientific breakthroughs for preventing and treating severe COVID-
19, including via vaccines, monoclonal antibody and steroid treatments. However, there is to-date 
no targeted treatment for SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammation and subsequent complications in 
COVID-19. In general drug treatments aimed at the virus have so far not lived up to their promise. 
Most notably the nucleotide analog remdesivir was demonstrated to mitigate the course of the 
illness when given early in the course [7]. Subsequent data however failed to show a benefit. While 
antibody for treatment has been available the uptake of this therapy has been limited by [CONTACT_533392]. While efficacious in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high 
risk of progressing to severe disease [8], monoclonal antibodies (e.g., bamlanivimab, casirivimab, 
and imdevimab) are costly and their administration is complicated for outpatients and providers as 
it is given intravenously, in an hour long infusion that must take place in a separate unit since 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533362]. A late 2020 report from the Department of Health and Human Services 
found that only 5-20% of available supply had been used. Currently the most widely accepted and

Version 2.2 12/14/21 Page 19 of 66available treatment is dexamethasone having shown a clear benefit in seriously affected, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] [9]. 
The most hopeful remedy for the population at large is vaccination and at this time vaccines from 
three sources ([COMPANY_007]/BioNTech, Moderna, [COMPANY_012]) have been authorized for 
emergency use in the [LOCATION_002] after having demonstrated the ability to prevent disease in up 
to 95% of individuals [10]. However, vaccines may not be sufficient to address COVID-[ADDRESS_692506], vaccine hesitancy persists (https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-
report/vaccine-hesitancy). Second, vaccination may only confer immunity for a limited number of 
months, necessitating the need for booster shots (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/scientist-
who-helped-develop-pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-agrees-third-shot-is-needed-as-immunity-
wanes.html), which may not be taken, or taken on time, by [CONTACT_533393]. Third, 
immunocompromised people, such as transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_533363], 
have recently been shown to not develop sufficient antibodies through vaccination [11, 12]. Fourth, 
it remains to be seen to what extent vaccines are effective against emerging new variants with 
immune-escape properties [13-15], especially the delta variant.
Moreover, given that even mild COVID-19 cases can result in devastating, likely inflammatory-
driven, persisting effects (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html), 
there is clearly an unmet need for a therapeutic option, especially an oral one, that can mitigate 
harmful uncontrolled inflammation and dysfunctional immune responses during a SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_692507] immune responses 
to the virus [16]. In the spring of 2020, our team was the first to publish data linking the 
inflammasome / caspase-1 / pyroptosis axis to heightened pro-inflammatory IL-18 levels, 
lymphopenia and poor outcome in COVID-19 patients [6]. Over the summer of 2020, a Brazilian 
study in over [ADDRESS_692508] evidence of NLRP3 
inflammasome activation and caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes 
in vitro, as well as in blood and lung tissue of COVID-19 patients [17, 18]. Inflammasome 
formation, as evidenced by [CONTACT_533394]-1 and NLRP3 in leukocytes and endothelial 
cells, was also found in the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19 pneumonia [19, 20]. Most 
recently, several studies further corroborated and expanded these findings by [CONTACT_533395]-

Version 2.2 12/14/21 Page 20 of 66CoV-2 infects monocytes and directly activates the inflammasome / caspase-1 / pyroptosis axis 
leading to pro-inflammatory cell death and cytokine release [21, 22].  Importantly, it was further 
demonstrated that a caspase-1 specific inhibitor was effective in blocking pyroptotic cell death of 
SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and subsequent release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-
1β, IL-6, and TNF-α [21]. In addition, from a mechanistic standpoint, it was recently shown that 
SARS-CoV-2 viroporin encoded by [CONTACT_533396]3a activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 via 
potassium efflux [23]. Moreover, key ORF3a amino acid residues required for inflammasome 
activation were found to be conserved in virus isolates across continents, highlighting the 
universality of this inflammatory pathway [23].
Taken together, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that upstream SARS-CoV-2-mediated 
inflammasome and caspase-1 activation leading to pyroptosis, trigger uncontrolled hyper-
inflammation via cytokine release (IL-18, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) as well as immune dysfunction 
of monocytes and lymphocytes downstream [ 16, 24-28]. Moreover, activation of the 
inflammasome / caspase-1 / pyroptosis axis could also explain COVID-19 related organ damage 
and tissue pathology of the heart, kidney, lungs, liver, pancreas and nervous systems, as it has been 
shown that SARS-CoV-2 also appears to cause pyroptosis in a variety of other cell types, including 
lung pneumocytes and endothelial cells in these organs [27-32].

Version 2.2 12/14/[ADDRESS_692509] with water is a highly specific caspase-1 
inhibitor (also known as IL-1β  converting enzyme) upstream of pyroptosis and pro-inflammatory 
cytokine release, is a much more targeted and potentially safer alternative to current generalized 
anti-inflammatory COVID-19 treatments such as corticosteroids, especially for comorbid patients 
with an already chronically-activated inflammasome [6, 25, 27, 28, 33-36] (Illustration 1).
1.2 Belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-201/MSR-001)
The drug substance has a molecular formula of C 24N33CIN 4O6 and has molecular weight of 509.[ADDRESS_692510] with water to an active form and is 
a caspase-1 inhibitor (caspase-1 is also known as IL-1β  converting enzyme). Blocking this enzyme 
with belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-201/MSR-001) has been shown to prevent production of IL-1β, 
IL-18, and pyroptosis in healthy and disease states. The drug has been extensively developed 
originally by [CONTACT_533397]. 
1.3 Dosing rationale
Belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-201/MSR-001) has previously been studied in rodents and large 
animals including dogs and monkeys to doses of up to 2000mg/kg/day for toxicity studies in dogs. 
Dosing at these levels and in multi-dosing schedules have not shown any severe and particularly 
life-threatening side effects. In human trials, including for conditions such as seizure disorders, the 
drug has been trialed in increments of 300mg/dose on a TID or QID regimen up to 900mg QID for 
13 weeks, in nearly 100 patients. 
Detailed pharmacokinetic studies from Vertex / Roivant are available for review. In brief, ex-vivo 
studies have demonstrated that Lipopolysaccharide stimulated IL-1β production is 50% suppressed 
by [CONTACT_533398] a concentration of 0.8mcg/ml. This translated in to 50% 
suppression of IL-1β by [CONTACT_533399] 400mg while 80% suppression was achieved with 
doses of 800 and 1600mg. There was gradual but marked inhibition of IL-18 over 14 days in 
healthy controls as compared to placebo and 60% inhibition with 900mg TID as well as 1200mg 
TID and 1800mg TID during the duration of the study. For this study we have therefore chosen 
our primary dose as 900mg TID in the absence of data on acute viral infection / COVID-19.

 Study title: Safety, tolerability, and treatment effect of belnacasan in patients with COVID-19 
Version 2.2 12/14/21 Page 22 of 66The drug has previously been manufactured with appropriate due diligence in tablet form at 
300mg/tablet (Data available from Roivant Sciences) and will be manufactured by [CONTACT_533400] (Metrics), in the original format for immediate use in this trial.
For this trial we will treat for a maximum of 28 days. Our rationale for this timeframe is that while 
there is an expectation that the illness lasts up to 12-15 days in those who recover without 
complication, others will endure a longer duration, and some will experience persistent, new onset 
or worsening disease related symptoms. A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e3.htm?s_cid=mm7017e3_w)  
found that among 3,171 non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533364]-19 patients, 69% had one or more 
outpatient visits 28–[ADDRESS_692511] visit. Symptoms potentially related to 
COVID-19 were common new visit diagnoses. Visits for these symptoms decreased after 60 days 
but for some patients continued through 120–[ADDRESS_692512] of the drug 
in this latter population we do need to establish safety for a duration that includes the other groups 
mentioned above. 
1.4 Brief summary of known systemic safety profile of belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-
201/MSR-001)
Based on files held by [CONTACT_533401], which contains evidence from animal and 
human studies, there is no indication that belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-201/MSR-001) causes severe 
or life-threatening side effects. The only preclinical finding on toxicity studies was a reduction of 
the heart rate in dogs at 2000mg/kg/day, a dose that was estimated to be 10-25 times higher than 
the maximum in this study (900mg QID). In humans with epi[INVESTIGATOR_533365] 3600mg/day for up to 13 weeks. Adverse effects reported in humans were headache, 
dizziness, nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort and rash. Seizure was reported in more than 
one patient in one study on epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].

that it will take time for the vaccine and any needed boosters to reach critical mass in the 
population, especially in the face of vaccine hesitancy; and that vaccines might not always be 
effective, especially as new virus strands and variants continue to emerge and early data show that 
immunosuppressed patients may struggle to develop anti-bodies. Second, while the most 
frequently heralded therapeutic of remdesivir offers the potential for earlier clearance of the virus, 
the inflammatory cascade results in continued need for inpatient and especially intensive care in 
high-risk patients. Furthermore, as an IV drug, the treatment itself requires inpatient treatment and 
likely needs specific timing to be optimally effective. Third, the prospect of immunosuppression, 
for example with a broad therapy such as dexamethasone or other equivalent corticosteroid, affects 
the inflammatory cascade but any use beyond a few days carries risks and therefore disadvantages 
that we believe will come to light with greater use of the drug and scrutiny of outcomes going 
forward. Over the next [ADDRESS_692514], it is clear from the pathophysiology that clearing virus may not be enough and such specific 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_533366]’s inflammatory response is important to reduce morbidity and 
mortality. We believe that what is needed is an immunologically targeted medication that can 
be taken orally - and without the prospect of major immunosuppression in at-risk patients - 
and that can even be taken for early treatment in high-risk patients. Based on the data 
presented here we believe that belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-201/MSR-001) may fulfil this role.

Grade [ADDRESS_692544] will be performed for up 
to 60 days.
At the screening / baseline / day 1 Visit, subjects will provide informed consent and be screened 
for eligibility based on the Inclusion / Exclusion criteria identified in Section 5.3. Subjects will 
also receive the first dose of study drug at this visit once study eligibility has been confirmed, and 
the second dose of study drug will be taken approximately 8-[ADDRESS_692545] dose. Study 
drug will be continued three times daily (morning, mid-day, and nighttime doses) through day 28.  
Some patients identified will require a PCR-confirmed COVID test, having only had a rapid 
antigen test.  Patients requiring a PCR test can either have one collected with screening labs prior 
to leaving the MedStar enrollment site or have these labs collected via a home-health research visit 
at no cost to the potential participant.  Prior to study-specific procedures the study team will obtain 
their consent in-person or by [CONTACT_533403].  An e-consent platform, Interlace, may also 
be used to document consent electronically.  Once their COVID-19 status is confirmed via PCR 
they will complete the remainder of their screening/enrollment visit at either MedStar Washington

The trial duration will be approximately 60 days (8.5 weeks) for all subjects enrolled. As outlined 
in the Schedule of Events Table in Section 5.2, over the course of the study duration, all subjects 
will use a diary to record IP intake as well as symptoms and activity levels with guidance to do so 
at the same time each day; assess physical parameters using a study-provided thermometer and 
pulse oximeter for which detailed instructions will be provided at enrollment; be assessed at 
regular intervals by [CONTACT_533404]-person follow-up clinic visits; and 
give blood for laboratory tests. 
An experienced and appropriately licensed Study Team member will conduct the telephone study 
visits and be the point of contact [CONTACT_533405], such as high temperatures 
(above 38C) or low oxygen saturation levels (below 93%). The primary coordinator of the trial 
will be a registered nurse, experienced in vital sign and symptom review, with the ability to escalate 
any medical concerns to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_533367]’ illness 
or adverse event identification. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_230924]-Investigator, as 
documented on the study delegation log, is well-versed in delegation of appropriate tasks as 
defined by [CONTACT_533406]. Medical advice or direction will 
only be given by [CONTACT_533407], either mid-level providers or physicians, in 
partnership with their primary care team.
Subjects will be instructed to fill in symptoms assessment, overall health assessment, temperature 
and oxygen saturation levels in the diary each morning; and to note in the diary [ADDRESS_692546] in-person visits with the subjects 
on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and telephonic visits with subjects on days 1, 4, 10, 42, and 60; as well 
as when / if subjects contact [CONTACT_533408]. Subjects will receive 
reminders to complete the diary via text message and / or email. Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study drug for any reason will be asked to have an Early Termination (ET) visit the 
day the last study drug dose is administered; moreover, they will be encouraged to stay enrolled 
so that further safety and outcome information can be collected and analyzed.

Discontinuation Criteria and Early Termination Procedures
Subjects may withdraw voluntarily from participation in the study at any time and for any reason. 
Subjects may also be withdrawn on the basis of the Investigator’s clinical judgment. This study 
may be terminated at the discretion of MedStar Health or of any regulatory agency for reasons 
including safety and/or treatment effect. 
For enrolled subjects we anticipate that the main reasons for discontinuation of therapy will be 
either withdrawal of consent for continuation in the study or inability to tolerate the study. Other 
instances may include patient death, inability to take the study drug from severity of illness or in-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533371]. Subjective intolerance of the drug from minor side effects or 
alternatively cessation of COVID-19 related symptoms well ahead of the 28-day schedule may 
cause patients to want to discontinue the drug. With regards to drug toxicity itself, we anticipate 
minor symptomatology from adverse effects, such as headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, 
abdominal discomfort and rash (see also 1.4) based on prior human trial experience with the study 
drug. Should any subject dosed on the study drug experience seizures, which was reported as an

withdrawal are to be documented. Subjects who withdraw or who are withdrawn prematurely are 
to attend an early termination, at which time they will complete all assessments as outlined in the 
Schedule of Events (Table 1); moreover they will be encouraged to stay enrolled so that further 
safety and outcome information can be collected and analyzed. 
In the event that a subject is withdrawn prematurely due to an adverse event or serious adverse 
event, the adverse event or serious adverse event will be followed until it resolves or stabilizes, or 
until it is judged by [CONTACT_39982]. 
5.4 Concomitant and Prohibited Medication
At time of enrollment, and at any point during the study, medication or the ingestion of food that 
interferes with the IP would preclude participation in the study, including: 
Non-COVID19-related anti-viral medication such as lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], ritonavir, ribavirin or 
interferon-1β.
Systemically administered immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents, other than 
background standard of care for COVID-19 at the time.
In vitro studies suggest that CYP-mediated metabolism is not a major route of clearance for 
belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-201/MSR-001) or VRT-043198. However, belnacasan (VX-
765/RVT-201/MSR-001) was metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in a recombinant enzyme system. 
Drugs and foods that are potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and / or P-gp, as listed in 
FDA “Drug Development and Drug Interactions: Table of Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers”, 
including herbal medications such as St. John’s Wort within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever 
is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug
Subjects should also be advised against the consumption of grapefruit juice since it is a known 
inhibitor of CYP3A.

6.1 Study Drugs
All study medication will be managed by [CONTACT_533413] (RP). The 
Pharmacy will store and dispense medication to subjects. 
For all enrolled subjects, the first dose of study drug will be given orally only after the participant 
has documented consent, has completed screening and been verified to meet enrollment criteria.  
This screening visit may occur over more than one day if confirmatory PCR testing is needed.  
Subjects will be closely monitored for at least [ADDRESS_692561]. 
For outpatient subjects (and discharged former inpatient subjects), subjects will be instructed to 
take subsequent doses at 0600, 1400, 2200 (+/- 4 hours). They will self-record administration in a 
subject diary (see Appendix) to be reviewed by [CONTACT_533414]. The study team, under direction of the Investigator, will provide any needed medication 
education, including adequate storage requirements, with the subject and any relevant family 
member(s) or caretaker.
For subjects who become inpatients over the course of the trial, study medication will be supplied 
to the unit in which subjects are admitted and will be dosed by [CONTACT_533415], recorded in the 
electronic medical record, and overseen by [CONTACT_3476]. Doses will be given at 0600, 1400, 
2200 (+/- 4 hours). Those who cannot swallow tablets will receive crushed tablets suspended in 
water and immediately administered through a nasogastric tube, by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_533372]. At 
discharge and subsequent outpatient visits, enough medication will be dispensed to the subject to 
assure they have adequate supply until their next on-site follow-up visit.
6.2 Storage, Dispensing and Reconciliation of Study Drug and Identity of Investigational 
Products 
All study medication will be stored at room temperature until dispensed. Storage within the RP is 
locked and secure, accessible only to investigational pharmacy staff. Storage condition 
temperatures are recorded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days per year and the RP is 
immediately made aware of any temperature excursions. In such an event, study medication will 
not be utilized until MedStar Health provides further direction. It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that accurate records of study medication dispensation and administration

indicate a drug reaction or new symptoms that could be temporally attributable to the drug. The 
most frequent adverse effects in humans have been mild and mainly include headache, nausea, 
lethargy and dizziness. No serious side effects have been described in human and animal studies.
7.3 NCI CTCAE Definitions of Dose Limiting Adverse Events 
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) will be used for monitoring adverse events throughout study including those related to 
dose limitation. As noted above in section 7.2, adverse events with belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-
201/MSR-001) have been mild and of no consequence (grade 1 and 2 by [CONTACT_55550], see 
below section 7.8). There is no dose escalation in this trial that could result in new symptoms 
though it is possible that mild symptoms may become more severe.

of normal, and/or total Bilirubin > upper limit of normal) will not be enrolled in the study. 
2. Laboratory testing throughout the study period (see Section 5.2 Table 1) may, though 
unlikely, show an acute change in renal or liver testing to indicate acute organ-specific 
disease or involvement as a possible complication of COVID-19. In such a circumstance, 
subjects will be directed to seek care from the respective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/specialist. In the case of 
acute liver injury with functional impairment, the IP will be discontinued immediately after 
blood has been taken for future assessment of drug levels. In the case of subjects with 
elevated liver function tests suggestive of acute liver injury without functional impairment, 
IP will be held to discern in the first instance the possibility of an adverse event and 
restarted in consultation with the managing hepatologist if it is determined to be COVID-
[ADDRESS_692570] if it is determined to be COVID-19 related nephropathy. 
DSMB guidelines for unblinding will be followed in these cases as relevant.
3. Acute liver and kidney injury may be seen in the face of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_533377]-19, in which case the patients will be managed similarly to number 2 
above (also see Section 5.3 on discontinuation).
7.6 Treatment Emergent Adverse events 
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any event not present prior to the 
initiation of the treatments or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or 
frequency following the start of IP administration.
Adverse events will be captured following the first dose of IP and could be related or unrelated to 
the study drug. A TEAE is defined as any AE that occurs after the subject takes the first dose of 
IP.
Separate summaries for adverse events that occur during treatment (summary of treatment 
emergent adverse events) will be provided.

Version 2.2 12/14/21 Page 43 of 667.7 Laboratory Abnormalities
Clinical labs will be performed locally at WHC or other MedStar clinical sites. Labs to be drawn 
during the study include serum chemistries, a hematology panel and an immune panel (see 
Appendix 12.1 for more details). A serum pregnancy test must be performed, and the result must 
be negative prior to the entry of women of child-bearing potential. 
Clinical laboratory reports must be reviewed by a physician for out-of-range values within 
12 hours of receipt. Out-of-range values will be evaluated using the following notations:
NCS:  Not clinically significant
LE:  Laboratory Error
PT:  Subject abnormal; relates to the subject's usual state of health
CS:  Clinically Significant. This value cannot be explained by [CONTACT_533420].
By [CONTACT_108] a lab value flagged as "CS" indicates an adverse event and will be captured on the 
CRF. A laboratory test flagged "CS" should be repeated as soon as possible, then the Investigator 
should use his or her judgment as to whether the abnormal finding is sufficient reason to 
immediately withdraw the subject from the study.
If a laboratory value is considered to be serious and life-threatening and at least possibly related 
to the study drug, the subject should be immediately discontinued from the study and appropriate 
therapy started. Refer to Sections 7.8 to Section 7.13 for definition of a serious adverse event and 
related terms, and details on reporting a serious adverse event.
Particular attention will be paid to determine the possibility of drug induced liver injury (DILI) as 
detailed in the FDA guidance document “Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation.” Liver tests (ALT, AST, ALP, and total Bilirubin) will be performed at enrollment 
and at days 7, 14, and 28 throughout the drug administration period.  For patients exhibiting signs 
of liver disease such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, 
or rash, extensive laboratory testing will be performed that includes above liver chemistries 
immediately. Otherwise, on routine weekly testing an increase of serum aminotransferase levels 
to >3x upper limit of normal would automatically trigger repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours of 
all four of the usual serum measures (ALT, AST, ALP, and total Bilirubin) to confirm the 
abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing. If symptoms and/or 
aminotransferase levels remain >3x upper limit of normal, the participant will be monitored more

Hepatology. A case report form page will be created and DSMB review triggered. Otherwise, 
discontinuation of treatment will be considered immediately if: 
•ALT or AST >8x upper limit of normal
•ALT or AST >5x upper limit of normal for more than 2 weeks 
•ALT or AST >3x upper limit of normal and total Bilirubin >2x upper limit of

drug therapy, underlying disease, a combination of these factors, or if it is unknown. Subjects 
experiencing an adverse event should be carefully followed to determine outcome.
The Investigator will use the NCI-CTCAE for adverse event monitoring, version 5.0 will be 
applied in all instances. CTCAE version 4.03 may also be used especially when assessing 
laboratory tests given the complexity in applying version 5.0 in all instances, see

The relationship or association of the study medication in causing or contributing to the adverse 
event will be characterized as not related, remote, possible, probable, or definite as defined below:
Not related: Evidence indicates no plausible direct relationship to the study medication
Remote: Suggests other conditions are reasonably likely to account for the event including 
concurrent illness, progression or expression of the disease state, or reaction to concurrent 
medication
Possible: Suggests that the association of the event with the study medication is unknown; 
however, the adverse event is not reasonably supported by [CONTACT_145037]
Probable: Suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with medication 
administration exists and based upon the Investigator's clinical experience, the association 
of the event with study medication seems likely
Definite: Suggests that based upon the Investigator’s experience, the association of the 
event with the study medication seems very certain. 
Planned procedures such as surgery should not be recorded as adverse events. However, the 
medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the 
definition of adverse event.

related to the investigational drug.
Serious Adverse Event: An untoward event or reaction that at any dose:
results in death
is life-threatening
results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]
results in permanent or significant disability or incapacity
requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage
results in congenital anomaly or birth defect
In addition, any important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
Life-threatening: An event which a subject was at risk of death at the time of event. There is a 
distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. Severity is a measurement 
of intensity, thus a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious adverse event. For example, a 
headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be serious unless it met one of the criteria for 
serious adverse events listed previously.
7.10 Serious Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected from the time the first 
dose of IP is administered until [ADDRESS_692574] dose of IP. Medical occurrences that began 
prior to the start of study treatment, but after obtaining informed consent will be captured as 
Medical History/Current Medical Conditions on the CRF. The Investigator or site staff will be 
responsible for the identification and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition 
of an adverse event or serious adverse event, as provided in the study protocol. SAEs assessed as 
related to study participation (e.g., dosing, protocol mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change 
in existing therapy) or related to a concomitant medication will also be captured once the subject 
has taken the first dose of study medication.

documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the 
event and attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and other clinical  
information. Once the Investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred, they are' to report 
the information to MedStar Health within 24 hours and provide an assessment of causality.
7.11 Notification of Serious Adverse Events
The Sponsor will report all serious adverse events to regulatory agencies as required. In addition 
to the serious adverse events described in Section 7.10, other events that in the Investigator's 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_196402] a significant hazard, contraindication, or precaution should be considered serious. 
This includes, but is not limited to, blood dyscrasias, endocrine disturbances, hemorrhage from 
any site, or severe skin disorder. Additional examples are intensive treatment for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions. 
Subjects who experience an SAE must be given appropriate examinations and treatment. The 
Investigator must provide written information to the Sponsor as soon as possible.
7.12 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
All appropriate SAEs will be reported immediately to the FDA per reporting criteria for an IND 
Safety Report. The event(s) will also be reported locally to the IRB of record when the event

the number of observations, number of observations above the limit of quantification (if 
applicable), mean, standard deviation (SD) median, and range. Categorical variables will be 
summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Comparison of belnacasan (VX-765/RVT-
201/MSR-001) and placebo groups will utilize Poisson regression for counts, Cox proportional 
hazards regression for time-to-event data and mixed effects models for continuous and categorical 
data obtained over study days.

10.15 Data Management
All data relating to study procedures will be entered onto the eCRF (OnCore platform). CRF 
completion guidelines will be developed to assure the required data is appropriately captured.  
eCRFs will be completed for each subject. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data entered in each subject’s eCRF. Source 
documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study 
and document the dates and details of study procedures, adverse events, and subject status.

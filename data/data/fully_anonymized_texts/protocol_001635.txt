 The START -CKD study is designed to describe the benefits and potential risks of a ne w 
treatment strategy using a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa in subjects with chronic kidney disease 
and not on dialysis  (ND- CKD) .  Subjects will be randomly allocated to treatment with a fixed dose 
of darbepoetin alfa or to treatment with darbepoetin alfa using a hemoglobin ( Hb)-based titration 
strategy, which has been the conventional dosing strategy.   This study  aims  to estimate t he 
incidence of red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusions  (administered as deemed clinically necessary)  in 
each group and the differenc e in incidence of RBC transfusions between the [ADDRESS_1160262] s, such as cumulative darbepoetin alfa dose, total number of units of 
transfusions, Hb concentration, Hb- related parameters (eg, Hb variability, excursions, rate of 
change), and adverse (eg, cardiovascular ) events , will also be considered in order to determine a 
preferred dosing regimen. 
Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   START -CKD: Strategies Using Darbepoetin alfa to Avoid Transfusions in Chronic Kidney 
Disease  
Study Phase:   3 
Indication:  Management of anemia in chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis.  
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the incidence of RBC transfusions in ND -CKD  subjects  using 
either a Hb- based titration algorithm or a weight -based dose that will not be tit rated (fixed dose), 
and to evaluate the difference in the incidence of RBC transfusions between the 2 groups.    
Secondary Objective(s)  
To summariz e the following for each dosing strategy:  
• Transfusion burden  
• Time to first RBC transfusion 
• Achieved Hb concen tration  
• Cumulative dose of darbepoetin alfa 
To describe the difference in each of the above between the two dosing strategies.  
Safety Objective:  To describe the safety profile of darbepoetin alfa, including adverse events 
and the occurrence of adjudicated clinical events of interest . 
Exploratory Objectiv e(s) 
To describe with each dosing strategy:  
• Dose and Hb- related parameters  
• Initial Hb response and resulting dose and achieved Hb 
• Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Allosensitization over time  
Hypotheses:   The incidence of RBC transfusions in each treatment group (Hb- based titration 
group and fixed dose group) and their difference will be estimated, and no formal hypothesis will 
be tested.  The width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the transfusion incidence rate is 
expected to be < 10% (ie, ± 5% around the point estimate) in each group and the width of the 
95% CI of the difference in transfusion incidence rates is expected to be < 14% (ie , ± 7% around 
the point estimate).   The efficacy and safety  of each treatment group will  be described, as these 
aspects will assist in the determination of a preferred dosing regimen.

 Study Design:  This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel group study.  
Anemic, ND -CKD subjects, without recent ESA use,  will be randomized to 1 of 2 dosing 
strategies .  In the Hb- based titration group, darbepoetin alfa doses will be titrated to maintain 
Hb ≥ 10.0 g/dL.  In the other group, subjects will receive a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa.  All 
subjects will receive investigational product (IP) as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks 
(Q4W).  Treatment group, darbepoetin alfa doses, and protocol specified Hb concentrations will 
be blinded to the investigator, subjects and study team.  Subjects will be followed for 
approximately 2 years from the date of randomization.  
Sample Size:   A total of approximately 750 subjects (approximately 375 per treatment group)  will 
be randomized. 
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria    
Anemic ND-CKD  subjects:  
• Age 18 or older  
• Two Hb concentrations < 10.0 g/dL at least 2 week s apart   
• Not currently receiving dialysis with an e stimated  glomerular filtration rate of 
< 45.0 mL/min/1.73m2 during screening  
• Iron replete, defined as a transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 20% and a ferr itin ≥ 100 ng/mL  
• Clinically stable by [CONTACT_835738]:  
• Received erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs) within 4 weeks of screening  
• Received  an RBC transfusion within 8 weeks of screening  
• Received intravenous  iron or had changes to oral iron therapy within [ADDRESS_1160263] (darbepoetin alfa or placebo) will be administered subcutaneously every 
4 weeks.  Darbepoetin alfa will be supplied as a clear, colorless, sterile protein solution in singl e 
use prefilled syringes (PFS) at concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200 and 
300 µg.  Placebo will be provided in similar PFS as a clear , colorless , sterile  solution.  
The protocol specified doses (PSD) for use in this study are 10, 20,  30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 
150, 200, 250, and 300 µg.   
Every 4 weeks a protocol specified Hb will be measured using a n modified  Hb point of care 
(POC)  devic e and the results will be blinded.  The codes  provided by [CONTACT_835739] (SBP) will be entered into the interactive voice 
response/interactive web response ( IVR/IWR ) system at each dosing visit. The mean SBP 
obtained from additional blood pressure monitoring visits will also be entered into the IVR/IW R 
system.  
In both dosing groups, the dose of investigational product will be withheld if the subject’s mean 
SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg for three consecutive visits  (including blood pressure monitoring visits) .  
Investigational product will be restarted at the dosing visit when the mean SBP is ≤ 140 mmHg.  
Subjects randomized to the Hb- based titration group will receive an initial dose of 
darbepoetin alfa of 0.45 µg/kg, based on the subject’s screening weight, rounded down to the 
next lower PFS strength.  Subsequently, the dose of darbepoetin alfa will be titrated based on the Hb concentration at the current visit and rate of rise (ROR) as outlined in the table below.  The Hb 
ROR will be determined by [CONTACT_835740].  An IVR/IWR system will be used to determine and assign each dose.  
Subjects may be assign ed [ADDRESS_1160264]:  Dar bepoetin alfa

Subjects randomized to the fixed dose group will receive a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa 
throughout the study of 0.45 µg/kg, based on the subject’s screening weight, rounded down to the 
next lower PFS strength.  The same dose of darbepoetin alfa will then be administered Q4W for 
the duration of the study, with 1 exception: if the Hb is > 12.0 g/dL, the darbepoetin alfa dose will 
be withheld and placebo will be administered until the Hb falls below 10.0 g/dL, at which time the darbepoetin alfa dose will be restarted.   In order to maintain the blind when a subject in the 
Hb-based titration group is assigned [ADDRESS_1160265] .  
Throughout the study, investigators should provide adequate supportive care.  It is recommended 
that iron be administered to ensure TSAT l evels of ≥ 20% and serum ferritin ≥ 100 ng/mL and 
blood pressure be monitored and managed as appropriate, such as to target a SBP <  130 mmHg 
and a diastolic blood pressure ( DBP) < [ADDRESS_1160266] visits and assessments will occur from the time of screening through the end of study.  At the 
conclusion of  the scre ening period, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 
2 dosing strategies:  
• Hb-based titration group:  Darbepoetin alfa titrated to maintain Hb ≥ 10.0 g/dL  
• Fixed dose group:  Weight -based dose of darbepoetin alfa that will not be titrated  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_835741] 12 months prior to random ization (yes/no) and site practice setting (nephrology/non- nephrology).  
Assessment s during the study visits may include:  
• Recording of transfusions, adverse events, concomitant medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_835726] 
• Physical assessments (eg, blood pressure)  
• Collection of laboratory samples for evaluation of blood chemistry, hematology and iron 
status  
• Collection of blood samples for biomarker s 
Subject s ending investigational product prior to week [ADDRESS_1160267] be followed for the collection of RBC transfusions and endpoint data for adjudication.  
 
RBC 
transfusions should be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_835742].  Information regarding the context surrounding RBC transfusions will be collected throughout the study including units of RBCs transfused, the 
transfusion setting (eg, dialysis center, intensive care unit, emergency department)  and clinical

 events (eg, bleeding, surgery).  This information will be reviewed by [CONTACT_835743] (CEC).  
Events of death,  myocardial infarction, stroke, decompensated heart failure and 
thromboembolism, including vascular access thrombosis,  will also be collected from 
randomization through the end of the study and adjudi cated in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_835744] .  
Adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the time of randomization through [ADDRESS_1160268].  Serious adverse events will be collected from the date of consent.  Any serious adverse events with a fatal outcome (regardless of possible relationship to investigational product) occurring through the end of the subject’s participation on the study are to be reported to [COMPANY_010].    
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section [ADDRESS_1160269] plus 3 months  or end of study, 
whichever is earlier  (on-treatment approach).  
For the primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects in each treatment group receiving at least 1 RBC transfusion during the evaluation period will be presented with 2-sided 95% CIs .  The 
difference in proportions between treatment groups and the relative risk ratio will be described 
with 2-sided 95% CIs .  Confidence intervals will be derived using normal approximation.  The 
primary analysis will be repeated by [CONTACT_205995] . 
As a sensitivity analysis , the primary analysis will be repeated using all randomized subjects with 
the evaluation period beginning at the date of randomization and subjects will be censored at the 
end of study (on- study approach).  
Sensitivity analyses will also be performed to assess the impact of potential differential follow -up 
on the primary endpoint .  Exposure- adjusted subject incidence of receiving at least 1 RBC 
transfusion will be calculated with 95% CI using Chi -square approximation to the Poisson 
distribution for both on- treatment and on -study approaches.  
For the analyses of the secondary endpoints: total number of units of RBC transfused per subject will be summarized for each treatment group.  Time to first RBC transfusion using both 
on-treatment and on- study approaches will be described for each treatment  group.  Average 
achieved Hb concentration while receiving investigational product will be analyz ed as average Hb 
using the area under th e curve (AUC) method.  Cumulative doses of darbepoetin alfa adjusted for 
investigational  product exposure time will also be described. 
Safety endpoints  will include the descriptive summary of the time to adjudicated event endpoint  
by [CONTACT_1570], using Kaplan -Meier curves, Kaplan- Meier percentiles, the number of subjects 
censored, and the number of subjects with events.   Subject incidence of adverse events will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], high level group term, and preferred term by [CONTACT_1570].  Adverse events of interest will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  Subgroup analyses will be 
presented for all adverse events.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review unblinded study data on a regular basis throughout the duration of the study .  The DMC may recommend modifying or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90348], or suspending enrollment.  This recommendation can be based on any safety concerns, lack of efficacy/futility, or preponderance of early evidence of efficacy.  The DMC will conduct an interim analysis , which will occur when approximately 33% of subjects  have completed 12 months 
of planned study follow -up.

 1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary  
To evaluate the incidence of red blood cell (RBC) t ransfusions in chronic kidney disease 
subjects not on dialysis  (ND- CKD)  using either a hemoglobin (Hb) -based titration 
algorithm or a weight -based dose that will not be titrated (fixed dose), and to evaluate 
the difference in the incidence of RBC transfusions between the 2 groups .   
1.2 Secondary  
To summarize the following for each dosing strategy:  
• Transfusion burden  
• Time to first RBC transfusion  
• Achieved Hb concentration  
• Cumulative dose of darbepoetin alfa  
To describe the difference in each of the above between the two dosing strategies.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease  
Anemia is a common and debilitating complication of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) .  
It results primarily fr om decreased production of erythropoietin by [CONTACT_10521] 
(Eschbach and Adamson, 1985 ) and becomes increasingly prevalent and severe as 
kidney function declines ( Moranne et al, 2009 ; Astor et al, 2002; Kazmi et al, 2001).  
This renal anemia itself may be severe enough to require RBC transfusions or may 
contribute to the need for a RBC transfusion in patients who experience a clinical event which worsens the anemia (eg , bleeding, infection, or inflammation).   
Avoidance of RBC transfusions is desirable due to the association of transfusions with a number of risks as well as because of blood inventory constraints 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 17 of 67 
 (Goodnough  and Shander, 2007).  Some risks, including transfusion- related acute lung 
injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), hemolytic reactions, 
and bacterial sepsis, have been associated with transfusion- related death 
(Leo and Pedal, 2010 ; Eder  and Chambers, 2007 ).  Transmission of blood- borne viral 
pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T- lymphotropic virus  
(HTLV), hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) is a lesser risk of RBC transfusions due 
to contemporary screening practices, but the risk has not been completely eliminated.  
Concerns remain regarding transmission of pathogens such as West Nile virus  for which 
blood products are not routinely screened ( Busch et al, 2003) .  The possibility for RBC 
transfusions to transmit Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease is also a concern ( Busch et al, 2003).  
Chronic transfusions can also lead to iron overload and its complications (Despotis  et al, 2007 ; Goldman and Vanherweghem, 1987).   
CKD patients are at higher risk for specific complications of transfusions.  These include volume overload and hyperkalemia ( Despotis et al, 2007; Simon and Bove, 1971 ).  
In addition, transfusions may lead to allosensitization ( Murphey and Forsthuber, 2008).  
Allosensitization can increase the time a patient spends on the kidney transplant wait -list 
or even preclude transplant eligibility ( Susal et al, 2009), and has also been associated 
with shorter graft survival ( Seetharam et al, 2010; Opelz, 2005)  and accelerated 
atherosclerosis ( Hill et al, 2011 ). 
2.2 Darbepoetin alfa Background  
Erythropoie sis stimulating agents (ESAs) bind to the erythropoietin receptor and 
stimulate erythropoiesis by [CONTACT_835747] (EPO) .  
They have been shown to effectively elevate and maintain Hb concentrations in patients 
with renal anemia and reduce transfusion requirements. 
Darbepoetin alfa is an ESA produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells as a secreted 
glycoprotein by [CONTACT_12060].  It is a 165 amino acid protein that 
contains 5 N -linked  oligosaccharide chains, rather than the 3 contained in human EPO .  
The additional carbohydrate chains  increase  the molecular weight and carbohydrate 
content of the glycoprotein, which gives darbepoetin alfa an approximately 3- fold longer 
serum half -life and mean residence time than recombinant human erythropoietin 
(rHuEPO) in animal models and subjects with CKD, allowing extended administration 
dosing intervals ( Macdougall, 2000 ; Egrie et al, 1993).  Details of the chemistry, 
preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and clinical experience with darbepoetin alfa are contained in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1160284] been in wide use in CKD patients both on dialysis and 
not on dialysis to raise Hb concentrations  and reduce the need for RBC transfusions.  
Because observational studies had shown an association between anemia and 
increased cardiovascular ( CV) morbidity and mortality in ND-CKD patients 
(Collins,  2003; McClellan et al, 2002 ; Sarnak et al, 2002; Al Ahmad et al, 2001; 
Mann,  1999 ; Levin et al, 1999), clinical trials were conducted in this population to 
evaluate potential CV benefits of ESAs.  Contrary to the hypothesis, 2 large clinical trials did not demonstrate a CV benefit when anemia was treated.  The Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) study evaluated outcomes in 
subjects with moderate anemia treated with epoetin alfa to Hb concentrations of 13.5 g/dL vs 11.3 g/dL ( Singh et al, 2006).  The CHOIR study identified an increased risk 
for death and serious CV events in the higher Hb target arm (hazard ratio 1.34; 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.74), the imbalance being mostly for death and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19934].  The Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with 
Aranesp
® Therapy (TREAT) evaluated ND -CKD subjects with moderate anemia and 
type 2 diabetes who were randomized to receive either treatment with darbepoetin alfa 
to a target Hb concentration of 13 g/dL or placebo with rescue darbepoetin alfa therapy if 
Hb concentration fell < 9 g/dL ( Pfeffer et al, 2009).  The TREAT study did not 
demonstrate a benefit on the primary composite CV endpoint of all cause mortality or CV 
event (hazard ratio 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17), however, an increased risk of stroke was observed when compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.92; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.68).  The mechanism for the increased risk observed when targeting high Hb concentrations has not been determined.  It has been suggested that exposure to high doses, high 
cumulative dose of ESA, Hb excursions, and rapid Hb rises might contribute to these 
risks.  Thus, there is a desire to define a dosing regimen that can retain the transfusion benefits of ESA treatment while minimizing potential contributing factors listed above.  
Although in CKD patients ESAs have historically been titrated to achieve a predefined Hb concentration, this may not be the only possible dosing strategy.  In particular, a 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 19 of 67 
 dosing strategy using a fixed dose could mitigate some of the potential contributing 
factors of increased risk while effectively avoiding RBC transfusions.  A fixed dose 
strategy will avoid exposure to high doses entirely and could decrease the cumulative 
dose exposure.  Additionally, by [CONTACT_835748], the occurrence of Hb excursions and rapid Hb rises may be minimized.  A fixed dose may also reduce Hb cycling, which 
may be associated with frequent dose changes, which has been associated with worse 
outcomes in some observational studies of dialysis patients ( Gilbertson et al, 2008; 
Weinhandl et al, 2011 ).  A consistent, fixed dosing strategy, without titration, may also 
simplify therapy for patients and providers, which may potentially improve compliance 
and minimize dosing errors. 
The ability of treatment with a fixed dose to effectively reduce the need for transfusions 
is unknown.  One prospective single arm study designed to use primarily 1 fixed dose of 
epoetin alfa has suggested that such a strategy can reduce RBC transfusions in anemic 
ND-CKD patients ( Provenzano et al, 2004).  During the short 16- week study, 3.7% of 
patients were transfused compared to 11.1% of patients within 6 months prior to 
enrollment.  However, this study enabled the “fixed dose” to be increased or decreased, and less than half the patients were maintained on the original 10,[ADDRESS_1160285] 
incidenc e of RBC transfusions (administered as deemed clinically necessary) in each 
group and the difference in incidence of RBC transfusions between the 2 groups .  
However, determining a preferred dosing regimen will also be based on multiple 
considerations, such  as cumulative darbepoetin alfa dose, total number of units of 
transfusions , Hb concentration, Hb- related parameters (eg, Hb variability, excursions, 
rate of change), and  adverse (eg, CV) events .  Given these considerations, an 
estimation approach was chos en for this study . 
The dosing algorithm that will be used in the Hb- based titration group is intended to 
maintain Hb concentration ≥ 10.0 g/dL , with a starting dose of 0.45 µg/kg, to be 
administered every 4 weeks ( Q4W ).  Model -based simulations were used to select a 
fixed dose that would achieve approximately the same population mean 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 20 of 67 
 Hb concentration at the end of the s tudy.  The  simulations , conducted in a similar 
fashion as previously published ( Doshi et al, 2010), predicted  that a darbepoetin alfa 
dose of 0.45  µg/kg/Q4W should be used .  
The starting dose is the same for both of the dosing algorithms .  Thus it will be possible 
to analyze the dose received and achieved Hb concentrations  by [CONTACT_835749] . 
2.4 Clinical Hypotheses 
The incidence of RBC transfusions in each treatment group (Hb -based titration group 
and fixed dose group) and their difference will be estimated, and no  formal hypothesis  
will be tested .  The width of the 95% CI of the tran sfusion incidence rate is expected to  
be < 10% (ie, ± 5% around the point estimate) in each group and the width of the 
95% CI of the difference in transfusion incidence rates is expected to be 
< 14% (ie, ± 7% around the point estimate).  The efficacy and safety of each treatment 
group will be described, as these aspects will assist in the determination of a preferred 
dosing regimen.  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel group study.  Anemic, 
ND-CKD subjects , without recent ESA use,  will be randomized to 1 of 2 dosing 
strategies.  In the Hb -based titration group, darbepoetin alfa doses will be titrated to 
maintain Hb ≥ 10.0 g/dL.  In the other group, subjects will receive a fixed  dose of 
darbepoetin alfa.  All subjects will receive investigational product  (IP) as a subcutaneous 
injection Q4W.  Treatment group, darbepoetin alfa doses, and protocol specified Hb 
concentrations will be blinded to the investigator, subjects and study team.   The overall 
study design is described by a study schema  at the end of the protocol synopsis section.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1. 
3.2 Number of Centers  
The study will be conducted in approximately 350 sites in North America.   Sites that do 
not enroll subjects within 6 months  of site initiation may be closed.   
3.3 Number of Subjects

7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Screening assessments and study procedures are outlined in this section and in Appendix  A.  The informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any screening 
or study procedures.   
All on -study visits and d osing should be scheduled from Study Day 1.  It is important to 
perform study procedures and obtain samples at the time points outlined in the protocol.  When it is not possible to perform the study visit at the specified time point, the visit may be performed within the acceptable visit window as defined in Section 7.1.  If a study 
visit is missed , subsequent study visits should resume on the original visit schedule.  
Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subsequent visits.  
With the ex ception of the screening and rescreen visits, all study procedures for a vis it 
must be c ompleted on the same day.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure all procedures are performed according to the protocol.

 will also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further characterized for 
quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes.  Additional blood 
samples may be obtained to rule out anti -erythropoietic protein antibodies during the 
study.    
Subjects who test positive for neutralizing antibodies at the final scheduled study visit will 
be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  This testing should occur 
approximately every 12 weeks starting from when the site has been notified of the 
positive result, until:  (1)  neutralizing antibodies are no longer detectable or (2)  the 
subject has been followed for a period of at least 1 year ( ± 4 weeks).  More frequent 
testing (eg, Q4W ) or testing for a longer period of time may be requested in the event of 
safety -related concerns.  Follow -up testing will not be required where it is established 
that the subject did not receive darbepoetin alfa . 
Subjects who test positive for binding, non- neutralizing antibodies and have clinical 
sequelae that are considered potentially related to an anti -erythropoietic protein antibody 
response may also be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.

for detailed collection and handling procedures for all biomarker development samples.  
Sample Storage and Destruction  
These biomarker development samples  and any other components from the cells may 
be stored for up to 20 years from the end of the study to research scientific questions 
related to nephrology  and/or darbepoetin alfa .  The subject retains the right to request 
that the sample material be destroyed at any time by [CONTACT_59554].  The sponsor will be the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_835731] (eg, the scientific rationale for 
experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).  
Following the request from the subject, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_835732].  If a commercial product is developed from this research project, the sponsor will own the commercial product.

8.[ADDRESS_1160333] the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to his or her future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. 
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product at any time during the course of the study.  If this occurs, the 
investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate procedures for discontinuation from investigational product and must discuss with  the subject the options for 
continuation of the schedule of  assessments and collection of data, including endpoints 
and adverse events.  These subjects, as well as those who have stopped receiving investigational product for other reasons (eg, initiation of dialysis ), are encouraged to 
continue the schedule of study visits .  If the subject is unable or unwilling to continue the 
schedule of visits : 
• At a minimum, subjects should be followed for the occurrence of RBC transfusions 
and collection of endpoint data for adjudication

level of  follow -up the subject is permitting:  in person, by [CONTACT_756]/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, and/or from 
review of the medical records  
Withdrawal of consent  for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further investigational treatment and does not wish to or is unable to continue further 
study participation; subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available data can be included 
after withdrawal of consent .  The investigator will discuss with the subject appropriate 
procedures for withdrawal from the study.   
Should a subject (or a legally acceptable representative) request or decide to withdraw 
from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as 
thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  All information should be reported on the applicable eCRFs.   
Reasons for removal from protocol -required  investigational product  or procedural 
assessments include:  
• subject request to end investigational product administration  
• pregnancy in a female subject (report on Pregnancy Notification Worksheet; 
see Appendix  D) 
• safety concern (eg, due to an adverse event) 
• initiation of dialysis or receipt of a kidney transplant  
• lack of efficacy  (eg, need for a commercial ESA regularly)  
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study include:  
• withdrawal of consent  from the study  
• death  
• lost to follow -up 
• administrative decision by [CONTACT_11337]

Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1160335]’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates the pre- existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an 
association with a significantly worse outcome.  A pre- existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study and involves an intervention while on- study, such as elective 
cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure , is not considered an adverse event.  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device(s) , or 
adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device(s). 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1160336]  are reported using the applicable e CRF 
(eg, Adverse Event Summary  eCRF) .  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution,  
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],  
• Assessment of relatedness to darbepoetin alfa,  and 
• Action taken  
The adverse event toxicity grading scale used will be the [COMPANY_010] adverse event standard 
grading score.   The toxicity  grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix  B. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to 
darbepoetin alfa.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_835760]?  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to a device.

any study -mandated screening procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may be 
related to screening procedures?” 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure?” 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinicall y 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) should be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment will be used to determine whether a subject should be removed from treatment or from the study due to an adverse event.  A subject, or subject’s parent/legal guardian, may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an adverse event.  If the subject requests to withdraw consent  for further participation in the 
study , the subject should be encouraged to undergo, at a minimum, an end- of-study 
assessment.

 If an investigator considers  an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias,  or events that necessitate 
an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

with a fatal outcome (regardless of possible relationship to investigational product) 
occurring through the end of the subject’s participation on the study are to be reported to 
[COMPANY_010] .  This would include subjects  who have been re moved from investigational 
product and continued on-study .   
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required re porting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.  
The serious adverse event must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the Serious Adverse Event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an electronic Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  See  Appendix  C for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet/eSAE Contingency Report Form.  When the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via the eSAE Contingency Report Form, the data 
must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to any study -mandated activity or procedure.   This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedure”?

10.1.3  Subgroups and Covariates  
Subgroups and covariates to be considered include the stratification factors used 
at randomization, and  the following baseline factors: age, sex, race, baseline 
Hb concentration and baseline eGFR.   Subgroups are defined as

Additional analyses may be performed if other prognostic factors emerge in this study or 
in this population.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The objective of the study is to provide estimations with acceptable precision.  Thus, t he 
sample size is chosen to ensure that the width of the 95% confidence interval ( CI) for the 
proportion of subject s who receive at least 1 RBC transfusion in each treatment group 
will be ≤ 10% (ie,  ± 5% around the point estimate), assuming the proportion to be 25%.  
The choice of the precision of the estimated transfusion rate is based on clinical 
relevance and experience.   The estimated proportion of 25% of subjects  receiving at 
least [ADDRESS_1160344] hoc analyses in both treatment groups of 
TREAT of subjects who met the eligibility criteria for this study ([COMPANY_010] data on file)  and 
transfusion rates observed in other  studies (Provenzano et al, 2004; Lawler  et al, 2010).  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 48 of 67 
 To ensure the 95% CI with a width  of ≤ 10%, 300 subjects per group will be needed to 
enroll into the study.  In order to ensure this precision can be maintained for sensitivity 
analyses, 20% drop out  is accounted for, and  enrollment of  375 subjects per treatment 
group is planned .  This to tal sample size of 750 subjects will also ensure that the width 
of the 95% CI of the difference in transfusion incidence rates will be ≤ 14% 
(ie, ± 7% around the point estimate), assuming the proportion of subjects receiving at 
least 1 RBC transfusion duri ng the study in both treatment groups is 25%.   All 
confidence interval s are derived using normal approximation.  
10.[ADDRESS_1160345] treatment assignments will be maintained by [CONTACT_21925]/ IWR system.  
Only t he Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  and the supporting independent biostatistics 
group will have access to unblinded data .  Members of the [COMPANY_010] study team will not 
have access to unblinded data until the study is unblinded for the final analysis.   
The external, independent biostatistics group will provide unbl inded results, including 
aggregate and subject level data, to the DMC  for regular data reviews.  The role of the 
DMC is discussed in Section 10.4.  Any unplanned unblinding occurring during the study 
period will be documented and reported in the final clinical study report.

aggregated data  and revise the sample size in order to ensure that the desired precision 
of transfusion rate estimates can be achieved.  
An independent, external  DMC will review unblinded study data throughout the duration 
of the study  and may request additional data.  If warranted, the  DMC can recommend 
modifying or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] , or suspending enrollment .  This recommendation can 
be based on any safety  concerns , lack of efficacy/futility, or preponderance of early 
evidence of efficacy .  The DMC will convene approximately once every 3-6 months .  The 
DMC will oversee an interim analysis to assess the totality of the data , which will occur when approximately 33% of subjects have completed [ADDRESS_1160347]:  Dar bepoetin alfa

 10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.5.1  General Approach/Consi derations  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for all endpoints by [CONTACT_1570].  For 
continuous variables, these include number of observations, mean, standard error (SE) and/or standard deviation (SD), median, 25
th percentile (Q1), 75 th percentil e (Q3), 
minimum and maximum.  For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage are presented.  For time to event endpoints: Kaplan- Meier curves, Kaplan- Meier percentiles, 
the number of subjects censored, and the number of subjects with events  will b e 
summarized .  Confidence intervals will be constructed as 2-sided at the 95% level.   
Summaries of laboratory data, Hb and dose related parameters , and vital signs will be 
completed using the full analysis set, limited to measurements obtained while the subject 
is receiving the investigational product.  
10.5.2  Analysis of Key Study Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis  of the primary endpoint will be conducted using the full analysis 
set.  The evaluation period will begin  from the date of randomization and subjects will be 
censored at the last dose of investigational product  plus 3 months  or end of study, 
whichever is earlier  (on-treatment approach).  For the primary endpoint, the proportion of 
subjects in each treatment group receiving at least 1 RBC tr ansfusion during the 
evaluation period will be presented with 2-sided 95%  CIs.  The difference in proportions 
between treatment groups and the relative risk ratio will be described with 2-sided 
95% CIs.  Confidence intervals will be derived using normal approximation. 
The primary analysis will be repeated  by [CONTACT_835761], and also by [CONTACT_835762], gender, race, baseline Hb concentrations 
and baseline eGFR.  
Sensitivity analys es of the primary endpoint  will be repeated using all randomized 
subjects with the evaluation period beginning at  the date of randomization and subjects 
will be censored at the end of study (on- study approach).   
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of potential differential follow up on the primary endpoint .  Exposure- adjusted subject incidence of receiving at least 
1 RBC transfusion will be calculated with 95% CI using Chi -square approximation to the 
Poisson distribution for both on -treatment and on -study approaches.   Other sensitivity 
analyses, such as completer analyses for investigational product and study, may be performed as appropriate.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Endpoints  
Total number of units of RBC transfused per subject will be described for each treatment 
group, and will be a nalyzed using a negative binomial regression model which will 
include the stratification factors used at randomization.  As a sensitivity analysis, 
exposure adjusted event incidence of total number of units RBC transfused will be 
presented with 95% CI using Chi -square approximation to the Poisson distribution .  
These analyses will be performed using both on -treatment and on -study approaches.  
Time to first RBC transfusion using both on- treatment and on -study approaches will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_835763]- Meier curves, K aplan- Meier percentiles, 
the number of subjects censored, and the number of subjects transfused.   A supportive 
analysis will be performed using Cox proportional hazards model ( Cox, 1972) stratified 
by [CONTACT_835764] .  The hazard ratio and its corresponding 95% CI will be estimated.  
Average achieved Hb concentration while receiving investigational product will be described as average Hb using the area under the curve (A UC) method.   The median of 
the difference in achieved Hb concentration (Hodges –Lehmann estimate) between 
treatment groups will be calculated and 2 -sided 95% confidence limits  will be derived by 
[CONTACT_2329] a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum statistic ( Holander and Wolfe, 1973).  
Cumulative doses of darbepoetin alfa adjusted for investigation product exposure time 
will also be summarized, and the median of the difference (Hodges –Lehmann estimate) 
between treatment groups will be calculated and 2 -sided 95% confidence  limits  will be 
derived by [CONTACT_2329] a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum statistic.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Endpoints 
Time to adjudicated event endpoints, such as composite endpoints of mortality and CV 
morbidity, all-cause mortality, and fatal and non -fatal CV events, will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_835763]- Meier curves, Kaplan- Meier percentiles, the number 
of subjects censored, and the number of subjects with events.

Vital signs at each study visit will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  Average blood pressure on treatment will be described as average value using the 
AUC method , and medication changes secondary to elevated blood pressure will be 
summarized descriptively in each treatment group. 
The incidence and percentage of subjects who develop anti -erythropoietic protein 
antibodies (binding and if positive, neutralizing) at any time will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6490].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Explorato ry Endpoints 
All exploratory endpoints, except otherwise mentioned in this section,  will be described  
by [CONTACT_81591] .  In addition to Hb concentration and change from baseline at 
each study visit, the subgroups of Hb concentrations , will also be p resented.

11. REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
11.1 Informed Consent  
An initial generic informed consent form  (ICF)  is provided for the investigator to prepare 
the informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template 
will be communicated by [CONTACT_246529].  The written informed consent document should be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient population.  
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for obtaini ng written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol specific  screening procedures or any investigational products are administered.   
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject agrees to such notification, the investigator shall inform the subject’s primary care physician of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator should 
document such in the subject’s medical record .  The acquisition of informed consent and 
the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her notification of the primary care physician should be documented in the subject’s medical records, and the informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_506215].  The original signed informed consent form should be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form should be provided to the subject.  
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent  form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the 
subject and the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was freely given and understood.

12.5 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, a publication committee consisting  
of members of the executive committee  and appropriate [COMPANY_010] staff  will be formed , the 
governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  The 
committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for executive committee members  and 
[COMPANY_010] staff) does not guarantee authorship—the criteria described below should be met for every publication.

 Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)  
Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of 
Scholarl y Work in Medical Journals , which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; (4) and agreement to be accountable for all aspects of 
the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any 
part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors should 
meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
quali fy should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.  
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] for corporate review.  The Clinical 
Study Agreement among the institution, principal investigator, and [COMPANY_010] will detail the procedures for, and timing of, [COMPANY_010]’s review of publications.

   Amendment 1 
Protocol Title:  START -CKD:  Strategies Using Darbepoetin alfa to Avoid 
Transfusions in Chronic Kidney Disease 
 
[COMPANY_010] Protocol Number (Darbepoetin alfa)  20110226 
 
Amendment Date:  03 April 2013  
 
Rationale:  
The key purpose of this amendment is to  provide additional measures to improve blood 
pressure control in subjects enrolled in the START -CKD study who are receiving 
investigational product .  
The following changes have been made throughout the protocol:   
• The protocol eligibility criteria have been  modified and subjects with a mean systolic 
blood pressure > 140 mmHg or a mean diastolic blood pressure > 9 0 mmHg  at both 
screening visits will be excluded  
• Additional visits have been added for subjects with elevated blood pressures.  These 
blood pressu re monitoring visits will be required for subjects with a mean systolic 
blood pressure ≥ 160mmHg and may be conducted at the investigators discretion for 
those whose mean systolic blood pressure is < 160 mmHg    
• The dosing algorithm has been modified such that  investigational produc t will be 
withheld if a subject’s  mean systolic blood pressure is ≥ 160 mmHg for 3 consecutive 
visits (including blood pressure monitoring visits) and restarted only when the mean 
systolic blood pressure is ≤ 140 mmHg  
• Additional information regarding antihypertensive medication use will be collected at 
each study visit  
• Additional information regarding the investigational hemoglobin point of care device 
for the collection of study specific hemoglobin concentrations and the automated 
blood pressure monitor for the collection of blood pressure measurements has been 
provided. Both of these devices are provided by [CONTACT_835773].  
Additional clarifications and administrative changes h ave also been made.

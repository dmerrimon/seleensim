 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 Synopsis  
 Study overview  
This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages of a novel peroxide -inactivated 
whole -virus yellow fever vaccine , HydroVax -002 YFV, in healthy adults.  The c urrently available yellow fever 
vaccine is the live, attenuated YFV -17D vaccine. This live attenuated vaccine is contraindicated in multiple 
vulnerable populations including infants <9 months of age and immunosuppressed individuals such as those with 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, thymic disease, or persons with hype rsensitivity to eggs. Special 
precautions are  also noted for pregnant women, nursing mothers and adults over the age of 60 [1]. These 
contraindications and precautions stem from known serious adverse events associated with the vaccine including 
a serious nervous system/neurotropic condition ter med yellow fever associated neurotropic disease (YEL -AND).  
In addition to YEL -AND, vaccination with live YFV -17D can cause severe multiple organ system failure, 
described as yellow fever vaccine -associated viscerotropic disease (YEL -AVD), a syndrome close ly resembling 
wild-type yellow fever  virus (YFV) .  Because HydroVax -002 YFV is based on inactivated virus that is unable to 
replicate or spread to the brain or nervous system, we anticipate that these vaccine complications will be 
eliminated.  
 
 Enrollment Period  
It is anticipated that enrollment may be completed in 3.5 -4 months.  
 
 General  
This trial will be a randomized, placebo controlled, double -blind (within dosing group), dose escalation Phase 1 
trial evaluating dosages of 1 mcg and 5 mcg of HydroVax -002 YFV vaccine given intramuscularly on Day 1 (the 
day of first vaccination is defined as Day 1) and Day 29 in healthy adults ≥18 and <[ADDRESS_468172] of 10 individuals who receive HydroVax -002 YFV and 2 or 3 who receive placebo. The initial dose 
of HydroVax -002 YFV to be evaluated in Group 1 will be 1 mcg and the next dose to be evaluated in Group 2 
will be 5 mcg. Following asses sment of safety and reactogenicity data of Group 1 by [CONTACT_45000] (SMC), the vaccine dose will be increased to [ADDRESS_468173] four subjects enrolled (the sentinel subgroup) will include three HydroVax -[ADDRESS_468174] of those subjects.

 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Study Rationale  
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a mosquito -borne pathogen that is endemic in over 40 countries [2] and c linical 
presentation often involves severe acute onset with fever, nausea, vomiting, hepatitis, hemorrhage and renal 
failure.  The case fatality rate for severe cases of yellow fever ranges from 20 -60% [3, 4].  Prevention or reduction 
of disease burden is mainly accomplished through immunization with a live -attenuated yellow fever virus (e.g., 
YFV -17D or YFV -17DD)  but these live vaccines are specifically contraindicated in young infants, pregnant or 
nursing mothers  of young infants , people with egg allergies  or people with a number of pre -existing medical 
conditions .  In addition, specific warnings ar e in place for individuals >[ADDRESS_468191] developed an advanced yellow fever 
vaccine formulation in which the virus is inactivated using the proprietary  hydrogen peroxide -based  HydroVax ™ 
technology.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_468192] -in-person evaluation  of 
the safety and immunogenicity of a novel peroxide -inactivated whole -virus yellow fever vaccine . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Yellow Fever Virus  
Yellow fever virus (YFV) represents an important mosquito -borne human pathogen that is endemic in more than 
40 countries in sub -Saharan Africa and South America [2].  Although disease may be mild in some instances, 
clinical presentation often involves severe acute onset with fever, nausea, vomiti ng, hepatitis, hemorrhage and 
renal failure.  The case fatality rate for severe cases of yellow fever ranges from 20 -60% [3, 4].  There are no 
licensed antiviral drugs t o treat yellow fever and prevention or reduction of disease burden is mainly accomplished 
through vaccination as well as through vector control measures.  Though the requirements for protective vaccine -
mediated immunity are unknown for many viruses, a corr elate of immunity exists for YFV.  Protective immunity  
against YFV  was originally defined as a log neutralizing index (LNI) of ≥0.7 [5, 6] based on NHP challenge 
studies but more  recent yellow fever vaccine clinical trials have been updated to use more reliable serum -dilution, 
constant -virus plaque -reduction neutralization tests (PRNT)  [7, 8]. 
 
The live, attenuated YFV -17D vaccine was developed in 1936 and although there are two main substrains that 
are used in commercial manufacturing  (17D and 17DD), there appear to be no major differences in safety or 
immunogenicity between YFV -17D vaccines [3, 9-11].  Yellow fever vaccination is recommended for people 
living in endemic areas and for travelers who may visit endemic areas, and for many years, YFV -17D has been 
considered “ one of the safest vaccines in the world ” [12].  However, this live attenuated vaccine is contraindicated 
in persons with hypersensitivity to e ggs as well as  several  vulnerable populations including infants <9 months of 
age and immunosuppressed individuals such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, leukemia, 
lymphoma, thymic disease, generalized malignancy, and patients who are underg oing drug therapy (e.g., systemic 
corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites or other immunomodulatory drugs) or radiation therapy. Thymic

Common p otential side effects resulting from intramuscular injections include stinging, discomfort, redness of 
skin, or mild bruising at vaccine injection site.  
 
Uncommon side effects include  general signs and symptoms associated with administration of the vaccine 
injection, including fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, dizziness and fatigue. These side effects will be 
monitored, but are generally short term, mild to moderate severity and usually do not require treatment.  
 
Rare risks with any i njection procedure  include  infection at the site of injection. Signs of infection at the injection 
site include: severe pain, erythema , induration , warmth or drainage. There may be side effects from the study 
products, which may be serious or life threaten ing that we do not know about yet.

While individual subjects may not benefit from involvement  in this study, their participation is crucial to the 
larger societal benefit of improved medical interventions.  As noted in Section 2.1, the current  live attenuated  
YFV  vaccine is contraindicated in multiple vulnerable populations including infants <9 months of age and 
immunosuppressed individuals such as those with acquired i mmunodeficiency syndrome, thymic disease, or 
persons with hypersensitivity to eggs .  By [CONTACT_4907], subjects are enabling the development of a 
potential advancement to address this current unmet medical need.

 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Design  
This trial will be a randomized, placebo controlled, double -blind (within dosing group), dose escalation Phase 1  
trial evaluating dosages of 1 mcg  and 5 mcg  of HydroVax -002 YFV  vaccine given intramuscularly on Day 1 (the 
day of first vaccination is defined as Day 1) and Day 29 in healthy adults ≥18 and < [ADDRESS_468194] of 10 individuals who receive HydroVax -002 YFV , as well as  5 total subjects who  receive placebo . 
Each dose -group  will include a sentinel subgroup consisting of 3 vaccine and 1 placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. In each of the 
two ( 1 mcg  and 5 mcg ) dose phases, enrollment is halted after the dose 1 vaccination of the sentinel subgroup . 
Following assessment of safety and reactogenici ty data of Group 1 by [CONTACT_28749] (SMC), 
the vaccine dose will be increased to [ADDRESS_468195] 4 subjects enrolled (the sentinel subgroup) will include [ADDRESS_468196] of those subjects. This review 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_373918] (ISRC), consisting of the Blinded medical monitor,

clinical safety profile at the planned maximum  dose level  of 5 mcg . 
 
This route and vaccination schedule is commonly used for other inactivated whole -virus vaccines formulated with 
alum.   Analysis of antigen dose used in other ina ctivated alum -adsorbed, whole -virus vaccines consisting of 
closely related flaviviruses produced in Vero cells provides information of potential relevance for this dose 
ranging study of HydroVax -002 YFV.  The commercial tick -borne encephalitis virus vaccin e, TicoVac, contains 
5 mcg/dose, and the commercial Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine, IXIARO, contains 6 mcg/dose.  The 
experimental yellow fever virus vaccine, XRX -001, was tested in Phase I trials at 4.8 mcg/dose and at 0.48 
mcg/dose. [8]  Antiviral immunity following a single dose of inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine is 
low after a single 6 mcg dose, [35] whereas two or three intramuscular injections of a 12 mcg/dose vaccine were 
tested and found to be safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic [36]. 
 
Based on prior results with a closely related inactivated flavivirus vaccine (HydroVax -001 WNV , [37]) we do not 
anticipate significant safety signals.  Based on the animal model evaluations of HydroVax -[ADDRESS_468200] agree to the collection of venous blood per protocol.

5.5 Lifestyle Considerations  
During this study, participants are asked to:  
• Avoi d getting pregnant during the study from the time of screening until 30 days after the second vaccination  
• Use an acceptable contraception method, if a woman of childbearing potential , from [ADDRESS_468213] 
study vaccination until 30 days after the second study vaccination  
• Use a medically acceptable form of contraception, if a sexually active male,  until day [ADDRESS_468214] 
vaccination  
• Refrain from receiving another experiment al agent or participating in another clinical trial with an 
interventional agent  
• Refrain from donating blood during the study period  
• Refrain from a major change in exercise routine  or strenuous exercise  from 72 hours before any dose of study 
vaccine/placebo  and for 72 hours before each blood collection for clinical laboratory tests (Vaccination Days 
and Days 4 and 15 following each dose)  
• Abstain from travel to areas known to be endemic with Yellow Fever  virus  until [ADDRESS_468215] been completed, the investigator or designee is to review 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria and determine the subject’s eligibility for the stud y.  If there is any uncertainty , 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_119820] a potential subject is eligible for enrollment.  
 
Only the following information will be collected on screen failures: demographics (age, screen number, sex, 
ethnicity, and race) an d reason for ineligibility. Subjects who are found to be ineligible will be told the reason for 
ineligibility.  
 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) because of a laboratory 
value  that is outside the rang e of eligibility , but is thought to be due to an acute condition or due to laboratory 
error , may be repeated once

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 35 of 84 The IRB will approve the recruitment process and all materials provided prior to any recruitment to prospective 
subjects directly.  
 
Screening will begin with a brief discussion with stud y staff. Some people will be excluded based on demographic 
data and medical history (i.e., pregnant, prior travel, prior vaccination, etc.). Information about the study will be 
presented to potential subjects and questions will be asked to determine potent ial eligibility. Screening procedures 
can begin only after informed consent is obtained.  
 
 Retention  
Retention of subjects in this trial is especially important  for determining the primary and secondary endpoints. As 
such, after  vaccination , participating s ubjects will be reminded of subsequent study visits and every effort will be 
made to accommodate the subject’s schedule to facilitate follow -up within the specified visit window. 
Additionally, there are many circumstances that influence the ability to obta in outcome information after 
vaccination .  Follow -up visits may be conducted by [CONTACT_373922]. Lastly, compensation 
strategies will be implemented to encourage subjects to return for follow -up assessments and sample collections .  
 
 Compensation Plan for Subjects  
Compensation will be determined locally at the study site and in accordance  with local IRB regulations an d 
approval.  
 
 Costs  
There is no cost to subjects for the research tests, procedures /evaluations , and study product while taking part in 
this trial.  Procedures and treatment for clinical care may be billed to the subject, subject’s insurance or third 
party.   
 
  
NTI Protocol [ADDRESS_468217] 13 subjects will be randomized (10:3) to receive two doses of either 1 mcg 
HydroVax -002 YFV  IM injection or placebo IM injection 28 days apart .  The second 12 subjects will be  
randomized (5:1) to receive two doses of [ADDRESS_468218] Description  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vaccine  
The HydroVax -002 YFV  vaccine is a yellow fever virus , Vero cell tissue culture -derived  vaccine inactivated with 
hydrogen peroxide, formulated with 0.1% aluminum hydroxide. HydroVax -[ADDRESS_468219] contains 5 
mcg purified whole virus  YFV  formulated in a volume of 0.5 mL/dose with 0.1% aluminum hydroxide and 10% 
sorbitol , 0.001% polysorba te 80 in phosphate -buffer  [pH = 7.5]  with [ADDRESS_468220] cell DNA (<1 ng/0.5 mL) or Vero 
host cell protein (< 300 ng/0.5).  HydroVax -002 YFV  does not contain an tibiotics or preservatives.  The stoppers 
used for single -dose vials do not contain latex.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Placebo  and Diluent  
Sodium Chloride Injection USP, 0.9% (NaCl 0.9%, Normal Saline)  will be used as the placebo  and diluent . 
 
 Dosing and  Administration  
Based on dosi ng group assignment, subjects will receive either 1 mcg, 5 mcg, or placebo per vaccination dose 
administered in the non -dominant arm as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection on days [ADDRESS_468221] subgroup, termed 
the sentinel subgroup, includes 3 vaccine and 1 placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] . In each of the two (1 mcg and 5 mcg) dose 
phases, enrollment is halted after vaccination of the  sentinel subgroup. This allows the opportunity to identify 
potential early vaccine related adverse events in this subgroup prior to exposure of additional subjects, a design 
which decreases the risk of multiple serious vaccine related adverse events compa red to sequential vaccination of 
the entire dose group without halting [34]. After enrol lment of the expanded subgroups, escalation to the next 
dose group will be delayed until 14 days of safety data following the second vaccination  (corresponding to study 
Day 15)  is available from all subjects in the preceding dose group.

6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E6: Good Clinical Practice (GC P), screening 
records will be kept at the clinical site to document the reason why an individual was screened, but failed trial 
entry criteria. The reasons why individuals failed screening will be recorded in the Coordinating Center’s (CC) 
Advantage eClini cal®  (Electronic Data Capture System).  
 
Once consented and upon entry of demographic data and confirmation of eligibility for the trial , the subject will 
be assigned to a treatment arm within each dose group (low dose and high dose) subjects will be random ly 
assigned to receive the study test product or placebo. Subjects will be block randomized so that [ADDRESS_468224] 4 
sentinel subjects will receive placebo and the other 3 active vaccine. In the expanded groups, 7 of the 8 or 9 
subjects will be randomized to vaccine and 1 or 2 to placebo. Subjects will receive the same treatment for both 
vaccinations.  
 
 Randomizatio n 
Enrollment of subjects will be done online using the enrollment module of Advantage eClinical® . The 
randomization code will be prepared by [CONTACT_373925]. 
Advantage eClinical®  will generate a tre atment assignment for each subject after the demographic and eligibility 
data have been entered into the system. A designated individual at each site will be provided with a code list for 
emergency unblinding purposes, which will be kept in a secure place.

 Blinding and Masking Procedures  
This is a partially -blinded clinical trial.  
 
Study staff and investigators will not be blinded to dose group but, within dose groups, subjects, investigators, 
and study staff other than unblinded site research pharmacist (or other designated unblinded personnel 
administering study product) will be blinded as to the subject's treatment assignment (vaccine vs. placebo). 
Laboratory personnel performing antibody assays will be blinded to dose group and  treatment assignment.  
 
The randomization scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_373926] (i.e., research 
pharmacists performing study vaccination preparations and unblinded study vaccine administrators) at the clinical 
site. 
 
An unblinded site research pharmacist will prepare the study product and an unblinded research nurse will inject 
the study product per the randomization assignment. The pharmacist will conceal the contents of the syringe by 
[CONTACT_6406][INVESTIGATOR_373891], opaque tape, or other equivalent material. In addition, the subject 
will be asked to look away when the vaccine is being administered.

 Subject Replacement  
Subjects who withdraw, or are withdrawn or terminated from the study, or are lost to follow -up after signing the 
informed consent form, randomization, and receipt of study vaccine will not be replaced. Subjects who withdraw, 
or are withdrawn or terminated from the study, or are lost to  follow -up after signing the informed consent form 
and randomization but before receipt of study vaccine may be replaced . 
 
NTI Protocol [ADDRESS_468242] to follow -up if he or she fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to 
be contact[CONTACT_136589].  
 
7.4 Follow up for subjects that discontinued study intervention  
The primary reason for withdrawal from this trial will be recorded on the Study Status data collection form (DCF). 
Subjects will be encouraged to complete  the Early Termination Visit. The Early Termination Visit procedures are 
listed in Sectio n 1.2. 
 
Although subjects are free to withdraw at any time o r may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_29353] -
investigator at any time (see Section  7.2.1 ), those subjects who receive only one dose of study vaccine will be 
encouraged to remain in this trial for follow -up safety assessments (may be conducted by [CONTACT_373931]) c ontinuing through approximately [ADDRESS_468243] study vaccination. See the 
protocol -specific Manual of Procedures ( MOP) for alternate follow -up requirements.  
 
Every attempt will be made to follow all AEs, including solicited injection site and systemic reactions, unsolicited 
non-serious AEs,  SAEs , and NOCMCs  ongoing at the time of early withdrawal through resolution as  per 
applicable collection times defined for the specific type of AE.  
 
In the case of subjects who fail to appear for a follow -up safety assessment, extensive effort (i.e., three 
documented contact [CONTACT_373932] a certified letter) will 
be made to locate or recall them, or at least to determine their health status. These efforts will be documented in 
the subject’s study records.  
 
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_29353] -investigator will inform the subject that al ready collected data will be retained and 
analyzed even if the subject withdraws or is withdrawn from this study.

 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  AND PROCEDURES  
8.1 Screening and Immunogen icity Assessments  
 Screening  Procedures  
Screening procedures may be done up to 28 days prior to enrollment (Day -28 to Day -1). After informed consent 
the following assessments are performed to determine eligibility and obtain baseline data:  
1. Take a focused medical history, including the following information:  
• History of any chronic medical conditions related to inclusion and exclusion criteria . 
• History of any medication allergies including history of hypersensitivity to any components of the study 
product.  
• Concomitant medications taken within 60 days prior to signing the ICF will be reviewed with subjects to 
determine stability of chronic diseases and eligibility . 
• Ask if they are participating in another clinical trial or plan to enroll in another clinical trial during the study 
period . 
2. Women of childbearing potentials should be co unseled to either practice abstinence or use at least one 
primary form of contraception from [ADDRESS_468244] . 
5. Physical exam (standard exam at screening and targeted exam at enrollment) . 
6. Height and weight measurement (Calculation of Body Mass Index) . 
7. Vital signs measurement (including HR, BP, oral temperature) . 
8. Blood for la boratory evaluations . 
• Serology at screening: HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody . 
• Chemistry at screening: sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium , creatinine, glucose [non -fasting], ALT, 
AST, and total bilirubin . 
• Hematology at screening:  white blood cells (WBCs) , hemoglobin, and platelet  count . 
• Urine for glucose and protein . 
 
Clinical screening laboratory evaluations will be performed locally by [CONTACT_373933] .  Urine pregnancy tests will be perfor med by [CONTACT_7628].  The volume of venous 
blood to be collected is presented in  Table 3. 
 
NTI Protocol [ADDRESS_468245] will be referred for appropriate follow -up.   Laboratory values that are  outside the range of 
eligibility but are thought to be due to an acute condition or due to laboratory error may be repeated once.  
 
 Immunogenicity Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Humoral Immunogenicity Tests  
Neutralizing YFV -specific antibody responses following vaccination w ill be assessed by [CONTACT_185670] 50 assays 
performed on blood samples obtained at Baseline (Day 1) and Days [ADDRESS_468246] vaccination and at 
Days 15, 29, 57, and 180 following the second vaccination.

due to the event.  Graded laboratory abnormalities should be follo wed until either a return to normal or are judged 
to be stable, as determined by [CONTACT_978].  
 
In the absence of a diagnosis, any clinical safety laboratory test result that meets the definition of an SAE as 
determined by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., life -threatenin g) must be reported as an SAE using the AE/SAE form set.  
 
 Viremia Detection Tests  
Blood samples will be obtained on Day 4 after each vaccination for YFV  viremia testing. Viremia testing will 
include plaque assay and/or RT -PCR.  Positive results may be foll owed by [CONTACT_5001] (e.g., blind 
passage/amplification).   Frozen serum specimens for viremia testing will be shipped to Fisher BioServices. They 
will then be sent to OHSU (Beaverton, OR) for testing as needed.  
 
 Additional Sera Samples  
Additional sera samples may be shipped to Fisher BioServices for storage.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_468250] Values or Abnormal 
Clinical Findings  
If a physiologic parameter, (e.g., vital signs, or laboratory value) is outsi de of the protocol -specified range, then 
the measurement may be repeated once if, in the judgment of the investigator, the abnormality is the result of an 
acute, short -term, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_373903] (e.g., stress, anxiety, or “white coat syndrome”). A physiologic 
parameter may also be repeated if there is a technical problem with the measurement caused by [CONTACT_257937], 
or an inappropriate measuring device (i.e., inappropriate -sized blood pressure cuff).  
 
8.4 Unscheduled Visit  
If the investigator deems the  reaction warrants further evaluation or intervention, the investigator will give further 
instructions on the proper course of action, including a return to the clinic for immediate evaluation at an 
unscheduled visit if appropriate.  
 
8.5 Adverse Events and Ser ious Adverse Events  
 Definition  of Adverse Events (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, 
whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). An AE can therefore be any u nfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will b e considered as baseline and 
not reported as an AE.  However, if the severity of any pre -existing medical condition increases, it should be 
recorded as an AE.  
NTI Protocol [ADDRESS_468251] report occurring without being queried about the 
specific event.  
 
All AEs will be assessed for severity and relationship to study intervention (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 
All AEs, solicited and unsolicited, will be captu red on the appropriate data collection form.  Information to be 
collected for AEs includes event description, date of onset, assessment of severity,  relationship to study product 
and alternate etiology (assessed only by [CONTACT_373936] y to make a diagnosis and listed on 
the FDA Form 1572 as an investigator), date of resolution, seriousness and outcome.  AEs occurring during the 
trial collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. In addition, a ll 
medically -attended adverse events  (MAAEs)  (i.e., events for which medical care from a healthcare provider is 
sought) will be collected through Study Visit 09.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Solicited Adverse Events /Reactogenicity  
Solicited adverse events are anticipated l ocal and systemic adverse events for which consistent collection of 
information is desired. This may include:  
• Common and expected events according to the available knowledge about the product, or  
• Specific events of concern that should be ascertained on eve ry participant.  
 
All subjects will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_468252] vaccination local reactogenicity events, including signs of re dness and swelling and 
symptoms of pain and tenderness. The subjects will measure redness and swelling at the vaccination site with the 
measuring device provided. Systemic solicited symptoms will include feverishness, fatigue, headache, chills, 
nausea, new  muscle pain (exclusive of the injection sites), aggravated muscle pain (increase of existing pain, 
exclusive of the injection site), new joint pain, and aggravated joint pain (increase of existing pain). The subjects 
will measure temperature with the ther mometer provided.   Subjects will be instructed to notify the study center if 
they develop any severe reactions and/or fever equal to or exceeding 101. 3°F. 
 
Subjects will also  be asked to record any medications taken and any emergency room or physician visi ts (other 
than routine check -ups). The subject memory aid will be reviewed with the subject at subsequent clinic visits.  
 
After vaccination, antipyretics or analgesics should not be given routinely. Administration of an antipyretic or 
analgesic is to be re corded in the memory aid and entered into the CRF.

 Definition of Serious Adverse Event s (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32 (a)):  
• Death. 
• A life-threatening adverse event . 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37511] . 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, 
or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death , be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], etc.  
 
SAEs will be:  
• Assessed for severity and relati onship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product) 
by a licensed study physician listed on the FDA Form 1572 or by [CONTACT_373937] [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator.  
• Recorded on the appropriate SAE data c ollection form and eCRF.  
• Followed through resolution by a licensed study physician (for investigational new drug application [IND] 
studies, a physician listed on the FDA Form 1572 as the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator).  
 
Reviewed and eval uated by [CONTACT_456] , the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) (periodic review unless 
related), and the IRB/IEC . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Unexpected  Serious  Adverse  Reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
A S[LOCATION_003]R  is any SAE  where  a causal  relationship  with the study product  is at least reasonabl y possibl e but is 
not listed  in the Investigator  Brochure , Package Insert,  and/or  Summary  of Product  Characteristics.  
 
 Classification of an  Adverse Events  
The determination of seriousness, severity, and causality will be made by [CONTACT_63689] -site investigator who is qualified 
(licensed) to diagnose, provide a medical evaluation of adverse events, and classify adverse events based upon 
medical judgment. This includes but is not limited to physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.

Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 52 of 84 [IP_ADDRESS]  Seriousness  and Severity of Event  
Event seriousness will be determined according to the protocol definition of an SAE ( Section 8.5.1 ).    All AEs 
or SAEs  will be assessed for severity, according to the toxicity grading scales in  Appendix A.  
 
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be 
used to describe severity.  
• Mild (Grade 1):  Events that are usually transient and may require only minimal or no treatment or therapeutic 
intervention and generally do not interfere with the subject’s usual activities of daily living.  
• Moderate (Grade 2):  Events that are usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily livin g, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent 
risk of harm to the research participant.  
• Severe (Grade 3):  Events interrupt usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or 
may require intensive therapeutic inter vention.  Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Intervention  
The licensed study physician’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study product is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is o r is not reported in this study. If there is any doubt as to 
whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. The relationship to study product must be 
assessed for AEs using the terms: related or not related. In general , the study product must always be suspect. To 
help assess, the following guidelines are used:    
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal r elationship between the study intervention and event. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administratio n of the study intervention caused the 
event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology 
has been established.  
 
 Time Period  and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
For this study all solicited AEs will be documented for the [ADDRESS_468253] administration.  
 
For this study,  all unsolicited, non -serious AEs will be documented from Study Visit 01 (Day 1) through Study 
Visit 0 7 (Day [ADDRESS_468254] second vaccination).  
 
All MAAEs, SAEs and new onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMC ) will be documented from Study Visit 
01 (Day 1) through Study Visit 09 (final visit).  
 
Resolution of an AE is defined as the return to pre -treatment status or as stabilization of the condition, with the 
expectation that it will remain chronic.   Site PIs are required to follow all reported AEs until either resolution of 
the AE or until the event is stable, as determined by [CONTACT_7880]; all SAEs will be followed until either resolution 
NTI Protocol [ADDRESS_468255]’s 
permission, until the SAE is stable/deemed chronic , as determined by [CONTACT_7880].  
 
 Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigators Reporting of AEs  
Adverse Events, including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events,” will 
be captured on the appropriate case report form. Inf ormation to be collected for unsolicited adverse events 
includes event description, date of onset, investigator assessment of severity, relationship to study product, date 
of resolution of the event, seriousness, and outcome.  
 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporti ng 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigators Reporting of AEs  
Serious adverse events will be collected throughout the study until the final visit is completed.  
 
The following procedures will apply to all serious adverse events:  
• Assessed for severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product) 
by a licensed physician listed on the FDA Form 1572 as the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_249585] . 
• Recorded on the appropriate serious adver se event report form and electronic case report form (eCRF) . 
• Reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_202421], the SMC (periodic review unless related), NTI 
and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) (as indicated) . 
• Reviewed and followed to resolution  or stabilization by a licensed physician listed on the FDA Form [ADDRESS_468256].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Regulatory  Reporting of AEs  
Following notification from the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_29353] -investigator, NTI, as the IND 
sponsor, will review the suspected unexpected serious adverse event (S[LOCATION_003]R) and ensure it  is reporte d as an IND 
safety report to the FDA. Submissions of IND safety reports will be performed by [CONTACT_373938].  
Emmes  will notify all participating site Principal Investigators (i.e., all Principal Investigators to whom the 
sponsor is providing drug u nder its IND(s) ) of potential serious risks from clinical studies or any other source, as 
soon as possible.  Emmes, on behalf of NTI, will report to the FDA any unexpected fatal or life -threatening 
suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial 
receipt of the information.  If the event is not fatal or life -threatening the IND safety report will be submitted 
within [ADDRESS_468257] from FDA, NTI (or Emmes, on NTI’s behalf)  will submit to the FDA any 
NTI Protocol [ADDRESS_468258]  
This study will also assess New -Onset Chronic Medical Conditions (NOCMCs) from the day of receipt of the 
first dose of study product until study completion . NOCMCs are defined as any new ICD -10 diagnosis  (10th 
revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) that is applied to 
the subject during the course of the study, after receipt of the study agent, that is expected to continue for at least 
3 months and  requires continued health care intervention.  NOCMCs will  be assessed and recorded as unsolicited 
AEs.   
 
 Reporting of Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is not an adverse event. Pregnancies occurring in study subjects will be reported via Advantage 
eClinical® on the Pr egnancy Report form. No further study vaccinations will be administered to pregnant 
subjects, but if the subject has received a study vaccination and with the subject’s permission all study mandated 
blood samples will be obtained and the subject will conti nue in follow -up for safety events. Efforts will be made 
to follow all pregnancies reported during the course of the study to pregnancy outcome pending the subject’s 
permission.  
 
8.6 Unanticipated Problems  
 Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
The Department of Health and Human Services  Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers 
unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, 
or outcome that meets all of the following cri teria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in 
the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_32015]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
 Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and 
to the Coordinating Center (CC ). The UP report will include the following information:

relevant dates (vaccinat ion and adverse event), severity, relatedness, and outcome for each event.   Primary 
outcome measures include:  
• Occurrence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) at any time during the study . 
• Occurrence of all Grade 3 unsolicited adverse events (AEs) from firs t vaccination through day 29 after the 
second vaccination . 
• Occurrence of all Grade [ADDRESS_468259] vaccination through day 15 after the second 
vaccination . 
• Occurrence of solicited local AE and reactogenicity signs and symptoms in the 7 days after each vaccination . 
• Occurrence of solicited systemic AE and reactogenicity signs and symptoms in the 7 days after each 
vaccination . 
• Occurrence of any AE through day 29 after the second vaccination . 
 
 Analysis of Secondary  and Exploratory  Outcome Measures ( Immunogenicity ) 
Basic descriptive statistics, such as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals, and graphical summaries, such 
as the reverse cumulative distribution, of seroconversion rates and geometric mean titer (G MT) will be computed 
by [CONTACT_373940], [ADDRESS_468260] plaque reduction 
neutraliz ing titer  [PRNT 50] assay, or utilizing a Log 10 Neutralizing Index  (LNI) assay [5, 38].  For the purposes 
of this study,  and in line with recent yellow fever vaccine c linical trials [7, 8], antibody titers will be assessed 
using the PRNT 50 assay, and s eroconversion will be  defined as a PRNT 50 neutralizing antibody titer of ≥1:10. The 
limit of detection in the neutralizi ng assay will be a titer of <10.  For the purposes of determining seroconversion 
rates and GMT, antibody titers of <10 will be assumed to be 5 (one dilution step below th e assay limit value).  
 
Rates of seroconversion will be summarized by [CONTACT_373941] [ADDRESS_468261] vaccination and Day 57 after second vaccination.  Response rates for each treatment group 
will be presented with their corresponding 95% confidence interval estimates at each time point . The relationship 
between the proportion of responders and dosage will be examined using logistic regression.  The distribution of 
antibody titers will also be graphically summarized using the reverse cumulative frequency distribution of titers 
for each t reatment group.   
 
The PRNT [ADDRESS_468262] vaccination and at days 15, 29, and 57 following second vaccination 
will be summarized graphically for each treatment group .  The geometric mean titer (GMT) and pair -wise 
differences of eac h treatment group will also be presented with 95% confidence intervals.  The relationship 
between GMT and dosage will be examined using standard linear regression methods.   Secondary outcome 
measures include:  
• Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion ( 1:10 in plaque reduction neutralizing titer [PRNT 50] titer ) 
at day [ADDRESS_468263] vaccination and at day 29 after second vaccination .

10.1 Regulatory, Ethical and Study Oversight Considerations  
Each site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_373905]/her research site(s).   
 
NTI must receive the documentation that verifies IRB/IEC -approval for this protocol, informed consent, and 
associated documents prior to the recruitment, screening, and enrollment of subjects.  
 
 Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual agreeing to participate in a trial and co ntinuing 
throughout the individual’s trial participation. Before any study procedures are performed, informed consent will 
be obtained and documented. Subjects will receive a concise and focused presentation of key information about 
the trial, verbally and  with a written ICF. The explanation will be organized and  presented in lay terminology and 
language that facilitates understanding why one might or might not want to participate. The ICF must not include 
any exculpatory statements.  
 
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_373906] d esignee will describe the protocol to potential subjects face -to-face. The key information 
about the purpose of the trial, the procedures and experimental aspects of the trial, risks and discomforts, any 
expected benefits to the subject, and alternative tr eatment will be presented first to the subject.  
 
Subjects will also receive an explanation that the trial involves research and a detailed summary of the proposed 
study procedures and study interventions/study products. This will include aspects of the tri al that are 
experimental, the probability for random assignment to treatment arms, any expected benefits, all possible risks 
(including a statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject or to the embryo 
or fetus, if th e subject is or may become pregnant, that are currently unforeseeable), the expected duration of the 
subject’s participation in the trial, alternative treatment/procedures that may be available, and the important 
potential benefits and risks of these avail able alternative treatment/procedures.  
 
Subjects will be informed that they will be notified in a timely manner if information becomes available that may 
be relevant to their willingness to continue participation in the trial. Subjects will receive an expl anation as to 
whether any compensation and any medical treatments are available if injury occurs, and, if so, what they consist 
of or where further information may be obtained. Subjects will be informed of the anticipated financial expenses, 
if any, to the  subject for participating in the trial, as well as any anticipated prorated payments, if any, to the 
subject for participating in the trial. They will be informed of whom to contact (e.g., the site PI) for answers to 
any questions relating to the research  project.  
 
Information will also include the foreseeable circumstances and/or reasons under which the subject’s participation 
in the trial may be terminated. The subjects will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they are free 
to withdraw f rom the study for any reason at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled.

The extent of the confidentiality of the subjects’ records will be defined, and subjects will be informed that 
applicable data protect ion legislation will be followed. Subjects will be informed that the monitors, auditors, IRB, 
NTI, and regulatory authorities will be granted direct access to the subject’s original medical records for 
verification of trial procedures and/or data without v iolating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_4913], and that, by [CONTACT_2960] a written ICF, the subject is authorizing 
such access.  
 
Subjects will be informed that records identifying the subject will be  kept confidential and, to the extent permitted 
by [CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available and, if the results of the trial are 
published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential. Subjects will be informed whethe r private information 
collected from this research and/or samples/specimens will be used for additional research, even if identifiers are 
removed.  
 
Subjects will be allowed sufficient time to consider participation in the trial and  have the opportunity to discuss 
the trial with their family, friends or legally authorized representative, or think about it prior to agreeing to 
participate.  
 
ICFs will be IRB -approved and subjects will be asked to read and review the ICF. Subjects must sign the ICF 
prior to sta rting any study procedures being done specifically for the trial.  
 
Once signed, a copy of the ICF will be given to the subjects for their records. The subject(s) may withdraw consent 
at any time throughout the course of the trial. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by 
[CONTACT_373943].  
 
New information that significantly impacts the subject’s r isk of receiving the study interventions/study products 
will be communicated by [CONTACT_373944]. The ICF will be updated and subjects will be re -consented in accordance with 
IRB requirements, if necessary. Subjects will be given a copy of all ICFs that they sign.  
 
Study personnel may employ IRB -approved recruitment efforts prior to obtaining study consent if a patient -
specific screening consent is on record or if the IRB has agreed that chart review is allowed without a fully 
executed screening consent. In cases where there is not a patient -specific screening consent on record, Clinical 
Staff  may pre -screen via chart review and refer potential subjects  to the Research staff. Research staff would 
obtain written consent per the standard informed consent process before conducting protocol -specific screening 
activities.

subjects.  
 
Any amendments to the protocol or consent mate rials will be approved by [CONTACT_106526]. 
IRB review and approval will occur at least annually throughout the enrollment and follow -up of subjects and  
may cease if annual review is no longer required by [CONTACT_5279]. The site  PI [INVESTIGATOR_373910].  
 
 Study Termination and Closure  
This study may be prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause, including but not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Regulatory authorities  
 
If the study is prematurely terminated, the Pri ncipal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study participants and 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and regulatory authorities as applicable. Study participants will be

NTI Protocol [ADDRESS_468270]’s clinical information, and all other 
information generated during participation in this trial. No information concerning this trial , or the data generated 
from this trial , will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the subject and 
NTI.  
 
Subject confidentiality will be maintained when trial results are published or discussed in conferences and  is 
extended  to cover testing of samples/specimens. The study monitor or other authorized representatives  of NTI as 
well as governmental regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, may inspect all documents and records required to 
be maintained by [CONTACT_7880]. This includes , but is not limited to, medical records (office, clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and 
pharmacy records for the subjects in this trial. The participating site will permit access to such records.  
 
All records will be kept locked and all computer entry and networking pro grams will be carried out with coded 
numbers only and with password -protected systems. All non -clinical samples/specimens, evaluation forms, 
reports, and other records that leave the site will be identified only by a coded number and will not be identified  
by [CONTACT_423]’s name.  
 
As this research is funded by [CONTACT_18121], it is covered by [CONTACT_154386] a 
Certificate of Confidentiality.  By [CONTACT_122842], researchers cannot be forced to disclose or provide, in any Federal, 
State,  or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, the name [CONTACT_373957], document, or biospecimen that contains identifiable, sensitive information about the individual 
and that was created or compil ed for purposes of the research, unless such disclosure or use is made with the 
consent of the individual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen pertains.  
 
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the U nited States Government 
that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects, like this study, or for information that must be 
released in order to meet the requirements of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
A Certificate of C onfidentiality does not prevent the subject from voluntarily releasing information about 
themselves or their involvement in this research.  If any person or agency obtains a written consent to receive 
research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.  
 
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from reporting without the subject’s consent, 
information that would identify the subject as a participant in the research project regarding matters that must be 
legally reported including: child and elder abuse, sexual abuse, or wanting to harm themselves or others.  
 
The release of individual private information or specimens for other research will only occur if c onsent was 
obtained from the i ndividual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen pertains, or for the purposes of other 
NTI Protocol [ADDRESS_468271]’s decision can be changed at any time p rior to the end 
of the study by [CONTACT_154387]. However, if a subject consents to future use and 
some of their blood has already been used for research purposes, the information from that research may still be 
used.  
 
Some  samples may be stored at the local site and some at a central clinical storage facility. Samples may be shared 
with other investigators at other institutions. The samples will not be sold or used directly for production of any 
commercial product. No genet ic testing will be performed on stored specimens.  
 
Each sample will be encoded (labeled) only with a barcode and a unique tracking number to protect subject’s 
confidentiality. There are no benefits to subjects in the collection, storage and subsequent research use of 
specimens. Reports  about  future  research  done  with subject’s  samples  will not be kept in their health  records.

 Safety Oversight  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC ) 
The study oversight will be conducted by a SMC which is an independent group of experts that will be  established 
by [CONTACT_373945].  SMC members will be separate and independent of study 
personnel participating in this study a nd should not have scientific, financial or other conflict s of interest related 
to the study.  The SMC will consist of members with appropriate expertise to contribute to the interpretation of 
the data from this trial.   
 
The primary responsibilities of th e SMC are to:  
 
• Review and evaluate the accumulated study safety data in a blinded fashion for participant safety after the 
low dose cohort prior to proceeding to the high dose cohort, study conduct and progress, and  
• Make recommendations to the sponsors co ncerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial.  
 
The operating rules of the SMC will be established in conjunction with NTI guidelines.

HydroVax -002 YFV Phase 1 Study           24 January 2023 
 
  
Complete Clinical Protocol  Proprietary and Confidential   Page 67 of 84 The SMC will review the safety laboratory results , reactogenicity data , and adverse event information  collected 
through day 15 following Dose 2 for the Low Dose Cohort. SMC approval is required prior to initiation of 
enrollment in the High Dose Cohort.  
 
The SMC may also be asked to  review safety information on the low dose or high dose sentinel groups as 
documented in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
 
NTI or the SMC may convene the SMC on an ad hoc basis acco rding to protocol criteria or if there are immediate 
concerns regarding observations during the course of the study.  Any AE/SAE that triggers a study halting rule 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_373946] [ADDRESS_468272] the study site to suspend both study enrollment and study interventions (i.e., 
administering vaccine to subjects) until NTI provides explicit directions for resuming the suspended study 
activities. Concurrent with notification to the study site, Emmes will inform NTI that a halting rule has been 
triggered and that study activities, excepting follow -up with subjects for safety monitoring, have been paused 
pending the SMC’s review of the inciting event. The SMC will conduct an expeditiou s review of all relevant 
information, and a written summary of the committee’s discussion, to include any abiding concerns for subject 
safety, as well as any recommendations by [CONTACT_373947], will be submitted by [CONTACT_373948]. Any de cision to suspend study enrollment and/or study interventions, either temporarily or permanently, 
is exclusively NTI’s.  
 
The SMC will review SAEs on a regular basis and ad hoc during the study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Internal Safety Review Committee  (ISRC)  
An internal safety re view committee (ISRC), consisting of the blinded medical monitor, clinical program manager  
and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_373912] a rapid review of safety data collected through the day [ADDRESS_468273] vaccination through the day 8 visit, no 
individual halting rule was met, and no more than one unique Grade 3 adverse eve nt (i.e., no same adverse event 
in more than one subject) was observed then the study will continue with administration of the second vaccination 
to the sentinel group and initiation of enrollment in the expanded dose cohort. The ISRC may be convened to 
assist with this objective determination.  If the criteria above will not be met, or at the request of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
NTI, the SMC will be convened to review the sentinel safety data.  If the SMC is convened for any reason for 
review of the sentinel data, the ISRC will not be convened for the cohort and the SMC will determine whether 
administration of the second vaccination to the sentinel cohort and initiation of enrollment in the expanded dose 
cohort in order for additional study vaccinations is to be given.  
 
 Clinical Monitoring/Site Monitoring Plan

6.0 12Jan2023 • Immunogenicity analysis of the day 180 serum 
sample (Visit 09) was converted to exploratory 
analysis.  Changes were made in Sections 1.2, 
3.0, 9.4.3, 9.4.4 and 9.4.6. This change streamlined 
the analysis and 
reporting timeline for 
the clinical study 
without impacting any 
planned safety 
assessments.

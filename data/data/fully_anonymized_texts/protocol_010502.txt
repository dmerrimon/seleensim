•To evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with LDAC improves complete remission and complete remission with partial hematologic recovery rate (CR + CRh).
•To evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with LDAC improves the proportion of subjects achieving a composite CR (CR + CRi) by [CONTACT_800239] 2.
•To evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with LDAC improves complete remission rate (CR).
•To evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with LDAC reduces fatigue based on patient reported outcome (PRO) assessment of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and Fatigue Short Form (SF) 7a. 
•To evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with LDAC improves subjects Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core (EORTC QLQ-C30).
•To evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with LDAC improves event-free survival (EFS).
•To evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with LDAC improves the transfusion independence rates.

Objectives (Continued):   
•To evaluate if venetoclax when co-administered with LDAC improves the response rates and 
overall survival in molecular subgroups (e.g., IDH1/2, FLT3).
Exploratory Objectives:
•Exploration of biomarkers predictive of venetoclax activity and duration of response may be performed.  These analyses may be part of a multi-study assessment to compare responses to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or disease state.  Potential analysis may include, but will not be limited to:
oTo evaluate BCL-2 expression and outcome measures of overall survival and complete remission rate
•To evaluate the impact of venetoclax based on remaining subscales/items from the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L.
Investigators:   Investigator information on file at [COMPANY_013].
Study Sites:   Approximately 125 sites
Study Population:   Patients with treatment-naïve AML who are ineligible for intensive induction 
chemotherapy due to comorbidities.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 210 subjects
Methodology:   
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial.
Screening
Unless otherwise specified, screening procedures must be performed within 21 days prior to 
randomization.  Once screening procedures are complete and eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomized using a 2:1 ratio to one of the following two arms:
•Arm A:  Venetoclax plus LDAC
•Arm B:  Placebo plus LDAC 
Study Treatment
All subjects in Arm A will receive venetoclax orally once daily (QD) plus LDAC (QD) beginning on Cycle [ADDRESS_1104050].  Subjects will receive LDAC on Days 1 – 10 of each cycle.
All subjects in Arm B will receive placebo orally (QD) plus LDAC (QD) beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
Placebo should be taken within 30 minutes of food intake.  Subjects will receive LDAC on Days 1 – 10 of each cycle.
Cycle Length – 28 Days
•Venetoclax 600 milligram (mg) or Placebo Daily on Days 1 – 28
•LDAC 20 mg/m
2Subcutaneous (SC) Daily on Days 1 – 10
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104051] 2016-003900-30

Methodology (Continued):   
Subjects will continue their treatment assignment until documented disease progression per Investigator 
Assessment, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the subject meets other protocol criteria for discontinuation (whichever occurs first).  Accordingly, subjects may, in rare occasions, continue treatment after documented disease progression if the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient.  All subjects will have a Final Visit performed when treatment is discontinued unless the subject has withdrawn consent to participate in the study.  Baseline laboratory assessments will be obtained at Cycle [ADDRESS_1104052] dose of study treatment.  PRO measures should generally be completed prior to other procedures, clinical assessments, and the administration of study treatment; however, they may be administered following confirmation that the subject is able to receive study treatment at the visit.  Disease assessments by [CONTACT_800240] 1 (± 3 days).  Subjects with resistant disease at the end of Cycle [ADDRESS_1104053] of care.  In addition to being reviewed by [CONTACT_800241], all disease assessment information will be sent to an Independent Review Committee (IRC) to provide response assessment.  Interpretations from the IRC will not be shared with sites.

Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Bone marrow biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_778628].  Cytogenetic 
assessment will be done at a local lab during screening.  Samples for molecular markers and baseline disease assessment for potential MRD evaluation must be collected at screening.  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_800189] 1.  For all subjects a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_800190] 4 and every 3 cycles (± 1 week) thereafter, however, these collections are not required for subjects who are unblinded following the final analysis results.  Bone marrow collection can be completed as per institutional standard of care.  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_800191] (if no bone marrow was collected within the last 6 – 8 weeks, or if relapse or progression of disease has already been confirmed).  Bone marrow will be obtained until two successive samples indicate CR or CRi, however, these collections are not required for subjects who are unblinded following the final analysis results.  For subjects achieving [ADDRESS_1104069] be performed to confirm a CR once peripheral blood count recovery is noted, however, these collections are not required for subjects who are unblinded following the final analysis results.  Subjects will be assessed for response rate according to modified IWG criteria for AML (Cheson et al J Clin Oncol 2003).  Progressive disease is defined per European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations.  If additional treatments are needed to optimize subjects' medical care, they can be performed following institutional standards and procedures.  Subject's disease assessment is based on the most recent physical examination, bone marrow results and recent hematology values.  For subjects who require a delay in the next cycle of study treatment for blood count recovery after a bone marrow evaluation, hematology values up to pre-dose labs from Day [ADDRESS_1104070] one cycle of study treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_800244].  Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to completion of Cycle 1 will be deemed non-evaluable for response assessment.

Event-Free Survival (EFS):EFS will be defined as the number of days from randomization to the date of progressive disease, relapse 
of CR or CRi, treatment failure, or death from any cause.  If a specified event does not occur, subjects will be censored at the date of last disease assessment.  Data for subjects without any disease assessments performed after randomization will be censored at the date of randomization.
Post Baseline RBC Transfusion Independence:
Post baseline red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence rate will be calculated as the portion of 
subjects who achieved RBC transfusion independence post baseline.  The RBC Transfusion independence is defined as a period of at least [ADDRESS_1104074] Baseline Platelets Transfusion Independence:
Post baseline Platelets transfusion independence rate will be calculated as the portion of subjects who 
achieved Platelets transfusion independence post baseline.  The Platelets Transfusion independence is defined as a period of at least [ADDRESS_1104075]-baseline transfusion independence rates.

The proportion of subjects with complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic 
recovery (CR + CRh) by [CONTACT_800239] 2 will be calculated.
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Response Rate:The proportion of subjects achieving CR + CRi and MRD or CR + CRh and MRD response status may 
be calculated.  
CR + CRi Rate, CR + CRh rate, and OS in molecular subgroups:
CR + CRi rate, CR + CRh rate, and OS will be evaluated for molecular subgroups (e.g., FLT3, IDH1/2 
etc.).
Pharmacokinetic:
An analysis of venetoclax plasma concentrations may be performed using a nonlinear mixed effect 
population PK modeling approach.
Pharmacodynamic and Predictive Biomarker Analysis (Not Applicable for China):
Exploratory research may be conducted to find biomarkers predictive of venetoclax activity.  Peripheral 
blood and bone marrow samples will be obtained at study specified time points.  Biomarkers (e.g., characterization of Bcl-[ADDRESS_1104076] status) may be assessed to compare patient responses in the two arms in order to identify markers that may be predictive of venetoclax activity.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Safety:A safety analysis will be performed for all dosed subjects unless otherwise indicated.  For the study as a 
whole, AEs will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory test results and vital signs will be explored for trends and summarized as appropriate.
Exploratory Endpoints:
Patient-Reported Outcomes:Additional subscales and items from EORTC QLQ-C30 will be evaluated using a linear mixed effects 
regression model to test for differences between the two treatment arms.  Exploratory research will also be conducted on the subscales and items from the PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EQ-5D-5L.
Sample Size:
The primary endpoint of the study is overall survival.  The sample size calculation is based on the 
following assumptions:
•Median OS of 6 months for placebo plus LDAC arm
•Median OS of 11 months for venetoclax plus LDAC arm (hazard ratio of 0.545)
•Interim analysis of OS at 75% of death events with O'Brien-Fleming boundary
•2:1 randomization ratio to venetoclax plus LDAC, and placebo plus LDAC
With the above assumptions, a total of 133 death events will provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment arms at an alpha level of 0.05.  A total of approximately 210 subjects (140 in the venetoclax plus LDAC arm and 70 in the placebo plus LDAC arm) will be randomized into the study to obtain the 133 death events.

3.0 Introduction
Venetoclax Activity and Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Profile
Hematologic malignancies are highly dependent upon the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 
for survival.  Over-expression of BCL-2 is associated with tumor initiation, disease progression, and drug resistance, and is thus a compelling target for anti-tumor therapy.  Venetoclax is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2 that binds with > 1,000-fold higher affinity for BCL-2 (K
i< 0.010 nM) than for 
BCL-X L(Ki= 48 nm) or MCL-1 (K i> 444 nM).[ADDRESS_1104099] patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and a variety of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
1
BCL-2 over-expression has also been implicated in the maintenance and survival of AML cells and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics.  In addition, high levels of BCL-2 were associated with poor survival in a subset of patients with this disease.
2,3  The BCL-2/BCL-X Linhibitor ABT-737 has been shown to kill AML cells, 
including leukemic stem/progenitor cells, as both a single agent and in combination with cytarabine
2or 5-azacitidine.3  To further define the role of BCL-2 in this disease, panels 
of AML cell lines and primary patient samples were cultured in the presence of venetoclax.  Twelve of 24 AML cell lines tested were sensitive to venetoclax, with cell killing IC
50values of < 1.0 μ M (Appendix H ).  The sensitivity of primary AML subject 
samples was comparable to that observed for primary CLL samples, with a medianIC
50= 0.010 μ M (n = 57) for AML4(Appendix H ) 
  Venetoclax has also 
demonstrated killing of AML leukemic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo and antitumor efficacy in vivo, inhibiting the growth of AML cell lines or AML patient-derived primary cells systemically engrafted into immunocompromised mice.
4  Single agent venetoclax 
has been studied in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and was found to induce rapid reduction in blast counts in some patients indicating activity in subject with this disease.  However, not all AML cell lines, primary patient samples, or subjects treated with single 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)

to down-regulate MCL-1, indicating that they might combine well with BCL-2 inhibitors.  In support of this, ABT-737 has demonstrated synergistic killing of AML cell lines when combined with cytarabine or doxorubicin.
2  Likewise, the combination of ABT-737 and 
azacitidine demonstrated synergistic killing of 7 of 8 primary AML patient samples and completely inhibited the engraftment of human CD45 + AML cells into immunocompromised mice.
[ADDRESS_1104101] combinations resulted in additive cell killing, venetoclax combined with cytarabine or azacitidine showed synergistic effects on several AML cell lines (Appendix H ).  These data suggest that BCL-[ADDRESS_1104102] been observed between ABT-737 and cytarabine or azacitidine, and thus provides a rationale for testing these combinations with venetoclax in subjects with AML.  
 
 
 
 
 
.  Based on in vitro results, venetoclax was a P-gp, BCRP, and 
OATP1B1 inhibitor.  It was not a potent in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2D6 (IC
50> 30 μ M); and it did not induce CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 at 
concentrations up to 10 μM.

Venetoclax Preclinical Toxicology
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be 
found in the current Investigator's Brochure.[ADDRESS_1104104] different clinical presentations and differing responses to treatment.  AML is defined by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) as a myeloid neoplasm with 20% or more blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow.
[ADDRESS_1104105] common form of acute leukemia in adults with an estimated 19,950 new cases and 10,430 deaths in 2016 in the [LOCATION_002].
11  The incidence is approximately 36,000 in 
the US alone.  The median age of diagnosis is 67 years, with 55% of the patients diagnosed at [ADDRESS_1104106] of them are diagnosed over the age of 75.
For many patients with AML, initial treatment recommendations are a function of the 
patient's ability to receive and benefit from anthracycline-containing induction chemotherapy.  Most younger adults diagnosed with AML are considered fit enough to receive an anthracycline-containing induction chemotherapy regimen.  For fit patents, standard treatment for newly diagnosed AML consists of remission induction therapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline, usually daunorubicin or idarubicin (7 + 3), followed by [CONTACT_8215].  
Though some older patients receive anthracycline-containing induction chemotherapy, 
most older patients do not receive intensive induction chemotherapy but rather receive less-intensive therapy such as LDAC or a hypomethylating therapy.  Indeed, AML in older patients is often a biologically and clinically distinct disease with a diminished response to chemotherapy, low remission rates, and short disease-free/overall survival.  In older patients higher proportions of unfavorable cytogenetics, higher frequency of

M16-[ADDRESS_1104107] common adverse drug reactions across all indications are nausea, diarrhea, hematological effects, and serious and/or opportunistic infections.  Hematologic effects include neutropenia/febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and lymphopenia.  Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_800195].  TLS is an important identified risk and is predominantly seen in the CLL population with high tumor burden.  Based on pre-clinical data, decreased spermatogenesis has been identified as a potential risk for venetoclax.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104108] been treated in the 
venetoclax oncology clinical program:  32 subjects with R/R and in unfit AML received venetoclax as a single agent (Study M14-212) and 70 subjects received venetoclax in combination with other therapeutic agents including 45 subjects with HMAs (Study M14-358) and 25 subjects with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) (Study M14-387).  To date, the adverse events observed occurred at an incidence that appeared to be consistent with what would be expected in the AML patients both in monotherapy and combination studies.  Neutropenia is being closely monitored.
Overview of Phase 2 Study M14-212:  Venetoclax Monotherapy in AML
This is a completed study with single agent venetoclax in subjects with R/R AML and 
those unfit for intensive therapy.  A total of [ADDRESS_1104109] common adverse events observed in 
≥ 30% of the subjects in Study M14-212 were nausea (59.4%); diarrhea (56.3%); 
hypokalemia, vomiting (40.6% each); fatigue, headache (34.4% each); hypomagnesemia (37.5%); febrile neutropenia (31.3%); abdominal pain, cough, hypophosphatemia (28.1% each); epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, malignant neoplasm progression (25.0% each); dyspnea, hypotension, peripheral edema, pyrexia, and pneumonia (21.9% each).  Serious adverse events were reported in 27 subjects (84.4%), the most common being febrile neutropenia (28.1%), malignant neoplasm progression (25.0%), and pneumonia (15.6%).  Three serious adverse events were considered to have a reasonable possibility of being related to venetoclax (i.e., one event each of diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and pseudomonal bacteremia).  No cases of TLS occurred during venetoclax treatment.
Efficacy data for Study M14-212 are available for all 32 subjects, the majority (30, 94%) 
of the subjects had R/R AML and a few (2, 6%) were deemed unfit for intensive therapy.  The ORR was 19% (6 of 32 subjects), with complete remission (CR) in 2 (6%) and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) in 4 (13%) subjects.

Anti-leukemic activity was observed in and additional 7 (22%) subjects, with ≥ 50% bone 
marrow reduction with hematologic recovery in 4 of these subjects. 
Overview of Ongoing Phase 1b Study (Study M14-358):  Venetoclax in Combination
with HMA in Treatment Naïve AML
As of 09 March 2016, a total of 45 subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_1104111] induction therapy were enrolled into the escalation stage at 
three dose levels of venetoclax at 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg.  Venetoclax was administered daily during the 28-day cycles in combination with decitabine (20 mg/m
2
intravenously on Days 1 – 5 once every 28 days) or azacitidine (75 mg/m2intravenously 
or subcutaneously on Days 1 – 7 once every 28 days).  Preliminary safety and efficacy data are available from the ongoing dose escalation stage of this trial.
The most common adverse events for all subjects in Study M14-358 were nausea (53.3%), 
diarrhea (44.4%), febrile neutropenia (40.0%), neutrophil count decreased (31.1%), platelet count decreased, cough, and fatigue (28.9% each), edema peripheral and hypokalemia (26.7% each).  Events grade 3 and above were reported for the majority (91.1%) of subjects; the most common event was febrile neutropenia (40.0%).  Serious adverse events were reported for 27 (60.0%) subjects, including febrile neutropenia (11 subjects), malignant neoplasm progression (3 subjects) atrial fibrillation, abdominal pain, non-cardiac chest pain, pyrexia, pneumonia, sepsis, bone pain (2 subjects each).  All other events occurred in one subject each.  The combination of venetoclax with decitabine and azacitidine demonstrates a tolerable safety profile.  
As of 09 March 2016, the ORR, as assessed by [CONTACT_800249], was 62.2% (28 of 45), with CR in 12 (26.7%), CRi in 15 (33.3%), and PR in one (2.2%).  Four subjects (8.9%) were reported to have morphologic leukemia-free state (less than 5% blasts in bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_800196] 200 nucleated cells) after completion of Cycle 1.  Eight patients (17.8%) had resistant disease.  However, all of the patients with resistant disease had evidence of blast

reduction at completion of Cycle 1.  The patients enrolled into the 1200 mg dose level had 
a shorter follow-up at the time of this analysis.
The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached in either arm and dose escalation stage 
has completed enrollment.  Enrollment into safety expansion at 400 mg and 800 mg dose of venetoclax in combination with both HMAs is ongoing.  
Overview of Ongoing Phase 1/2 Study M14-387:  Venetoclax in Combination with 
Low Dose Cytarabine in Treatment Naïve AML
As of 28 November 2015, a total of 25 subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_1104113] induction therapy were enrolled; 18 subjects were 
enrolled into the Phase 1 portion of the study and a RPTD of 600 mg has been identified.  Enrollment into the subsequent Phase 2 portion with approximately 50 subjects is ongoing to evaluate the RPTD for efficacy and safety.  Preliminary efficacy data for Study M14-387 are available for 18 subjects with AML without a prior MPN treated with a 600 mg venentoclax target dose and LDAC as of 31 March 2016 (ASH abstract 2016).  The CR + CRi rate was 78%.
Of the [ADDRESS_1104114] 
common adverse events were nausea (68.0%), anemia (52.0%), and febrile neutropenia (36.0%).  Events grade [ADDRESS_1104115] (96.0%); the most common event was anemia (48.0%).  Serious adverse events were reported for 19 (76.0%) subjects, including febrile neutropenia (7 subjects), pyrexia, hyponatremia, and malignant neoplasm progression (2 subjects each).  All other events occurred in one subject each.  Fatal adverse events occurred in 5 (20.0%) subjects:  2 events of malignant neoplasm progression and one event each of acute hepatic failure, Candida pneumonia, and lung infection.  
Additional safety and efficacy data are described in more detail in the current version of 
the Investigator's Brochure.

Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104116] randomized study comparing venetoclax in combination with LDAC 
versus placebo in combination with LDAC in subjects with AML who are treatment naïve and are considered ineligible for treatment with an anthracycline-containing induction regimen due to age, co-morbidity or other risk factors.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Initial studies from the Acute Leukemia Group B, over 40 years ago, reported that 15% –
20% of patients with AML receiving LDAC at dose of 10 – 30 mg/m
2achieved a CR.13  
Subsequently, a meta-analysis including 293 previously untreated patients with newly diagnosed acute non-lymphocytic leukemia reported a CR rate of 32% with LDAC.
14  
More recently, a large, international trial for newly diagnosed patients using modern and more sensitive methods to determine the depth of clinical response reported a CR + CRi rate of approximately 11% for the patients randomized to LDAC.
15
There are currently no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800197], though low-intensity therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800198], azacitdine, or decitabine are relatively common treatment approaches worldwide.
As detailed in Section 3.0, preliminary efficacy and safety results of venetoclax in 
combination with LDAC are favorable and support further evaluation in treatment naive 
AML patients who are not eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy. 
Rapid AML cell death in patients can result in risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) during 
initial dosing.  Because of the known background risk of TLS in AML patients, venetoclax dose will be gradually increased to the final dose during initiation of study treatment in Cycle [ADDRESS_1104117] monitoring.

sponsored by [CONTACT_26282].  Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms in a 
2:[ADDRESS_1104121] treatment cycles of 28 days.
●Arm A:  Venetoclax 600 mg orally QD on Days 1 – 28 plus LDAC 20 mg/m2
SC QD on Days 1 – 10
●Arm B:  Placebo 600 mg orally QD on Days 1 – 28 plus LDAC 20 mg/m2SC 
QD on Days 1 – 10 
Approximately 210 subjects will be randomized to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.
5.1.1 Screening
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study specific procedures will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system.  The investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_1104122]'s medical records.  
Eligible subjects have up to [ADDRESS_1104123] up to 5 days to initiate Cycle 1 Day 1; however, this window cannot exceed the allotted 21-day Screening period.
5.1.2 Rescreening
Rescreening may be performed upon investigator discussion with the [COMPANY_013] Medical 
Monitor and subsequent agreement.

5.1.3 Treatment Period
After meeting the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled via IRT into a treatment 
arm.  All subjects will begin study drugs (venetoclax/placebo and LDAC) on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subjects in Arm A will receive venetoclax orally QD plus LDAC SC QD beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Venetoclax should be taken within 30 minutes after completion of a meal (preferably breakfast).  Subjects in Arm B will receive placebo orally QD plus LDAC SC QD beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Placebo should be taken within 30 minutes after completion of a meal (preferably breakfast).  Subjects will receive LDAC on Days 1 – 10 of each cycle beginning on Cycle 1.
Dosing Schedule Overview – for Venetoclax/Placebo and LDAC
Venetoclax or placebo for venetoclax will be administered with a 4-day ramp up 
beginning with 100 mg dose on Day 1, 200 mg dose on Day 2, 400 mg dose on Day 3 and 600 mg dose on Day 4 of Cycle 1.  Subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800192]-up period during Cycle 1 (i.e., Day 1 t hrough Day 5).  Subjects will remain in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93971] 24 hours after reaching the final dose of venetoclax on Day 4.  Venetoclax or placebo for venetoclax will be continued at 600 mg daily thereafter.  LDAC will be administered SC daily per protocol at 20 mg/m
2daily on Days 1 – 10 of each 
cycle.

On Cycle 1 Day 1, any changes observed from the Screening assessments (prior to dosing 
and not related to study specific required procedures) will be recorded in the subject's medical history.  At each visit, including the Final Visit and the 30-Day Safety Follow-Up Visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed and any clinically significant changes from baseline will be recorded on the adverse event eCRF.
Adverse Event and Prior/Concomitant Medication Assessment
All concomitant medications (prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins and/or 
herbal supplements) and AE assessments will be performed per Appendix C .  On Cycle [ADDRESS_1104168]'s medical history will be reviewed and any clinically significant changes from baseline will be recorded on the adverse event eCRF.
Cytogenetic Assessment
Cytogenetic analysis must be performed locally from diagnostic bone marrow (preferred) 
or from peripheral blood if an adequate number of circulating blasts (> 109/L) are present.  
Historic cytogenetic data will be accepted if done within 1 month prior to screening.
Molecular Markers
Profiling of common genetic abnormalities in AML may be explored on a mandatory 
screening bone marrow sample at a laboratory designated by [CONTACT_26282].  
Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Variables
PRO assessments include PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EQ-5D-5L.  
These assessments will be collected on or within 3 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, on Day 1 of every other cycle throughout the trial, and at the Final Visit per Appendix C .  PRO 
assessments will be self-administered by [CONTACT_800254] (ABT-199)

the sponsor and site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects 
other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  PRO assessments should generally be completed prior to any other procedures or clinical assessments and prior to dosing; however, they may be administered following confirmation that the subject is able to receive study treatment at the visit.  
PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a
PROMIS
®is a system of highly reliable, precise measures of patient-reported health 
status for physical, mental, and social well-being.[ADDRESS_1104170] 7 days.  The recommended minimum important difference range is 3 – 5 points; the lower bound (3) is being used as the minimum important difference in this study.
20  All questions employ the following 
five response options:  1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, and 5 = Always.
EORTC QLQ-C30
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms will be assessed with the EORTC-
QLQ-C30 version 3.[ADDRESS_1104171] self-report questionnaire 
composed of both multi-item and single scales, including five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), a global health status/quality of life scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties).  Subjects rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as "not at all" and 4 as "very much."  The QLQ-C30 was developed and validated for use in a cancer patient population, and its reliability and validity is highly consistent across different language-cultural groups.  A change of 5 to 10 points is considered a small change, and the lower bound (5) will be used to define the minimum important difference.  A change of ≥  10 to < 20 points is 
considered a moderate change.

EQ-5D-5L
The EQ-5D-5L is a generic preference instrument that has been validated in numerous 
populations.22,23  The EQ-5D-5L has five dimensions:  mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.  These dimensions are measured on a five-point scale:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  The scores for the five dimensions are used to compute a single utility index score ranging from zero (0.0) to 1 (1.0) representing the general health status of the individual.  The EQ-5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the subject's overall health.  The minimum important difference for the EQ-5D-5L utility index score in cancer patients is 0.08, and the minimum important difference for EQ-5D VAS is 7.

12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A single 12-lead resting ECG per Appendix C will be obtained at:
●Screening
●Final Visit (May be obtained within ± 2 days of the visit)
●As clinically indicated
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104177] 5 minutes.  Subjects will be instructed to remain completely stationary (no talking, laughing, deep breathing, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_800202]) for approximately 10 seconds during the ECG recording.  While ECGs are being acquired, subjects and staff are prohibited from having devices (e.g., cellular telephones, fans, heaters, etc.) that emit radiofrequency signals in the room.
Each ECG will be evaluated by [CONTACT_800255] (the 
"local reader") who will determine if any findings outside normal physiological variation are clinically significant.  The local reading of the ECG will be used by [CONTACT_197778], including adverse event determination and management, and subject discontinuation from the study.
The local reader will sign and date the safety ECG and provide a global interpretation 
using the following categories:
●Normal ECG
●Abnormal ECG – Not clinically significant (NCS)
●Abnormal ECG – Clinically significant (CS)
●Unable to evaluate
All local reader evaluations of ECGs will be entered into the electronic case report forms (eCRFs).  If the global interpretation is Abnormal (NCS or CS), the local reader will provide further information (e.g., sinus bradycardia, arrhythmia).  The QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) will be calculated for all ECGs and documented only if the QT interval is determined to be prolonged by [CONTACT_624542].
All ECG source documentation will be retained at the study site.  The automatic 
cardiograph reading (i.e., cardiograph-generated measurements and interpretations) will not be collected for analysis.

5.3.3 Efficacy Variables
Efficacy Assessments
Responses will be evaluated based on the revised guidelines by [CONTACT_800266] (IWG) for AML.  Progressive disease is defined per European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations.  Subject's response is based on most recent physical examination, bone marrow results and recent hematology values.  For subjects who require a delay in the next cycle of study treatment for blood count recovery after a bone marrow evaluation, hematology values up to pre-dose labs from Day [ADDRESS_1104200] antecedent hematologic illnesses, hematologic response including transfusion independence will also be evaluated.
Criteria for evaluation are as follows:
●CR:  No morphologic evidence of AML and absolute neutrophil count 
≥10
3/μL, platelets ≥ 105/μL, red cell transfusion independence, and bone 
marrow with < 5% blasts, absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer 
rods; absence of extramedullary disease.
●CRi:  All criteria as CR except for residual neutropenia < 103/μL (1,000/μL) or 
thrombocytopenia < 105/μL (100,000/μ L).  If all criteria for CR are met except 
for RBC transfusion independence, this also fulfills CRi criteria.
●PR:  All of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].

●MLFS:  Less than 5% blasts in an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_800218] a count of at least 200 nucleated cells, absence of circulating leukemia 
cells, absence of extramedullary disease, and absolute neutrophils < 103/μL 
(1,000/μ L) and thrombocytopenia < 105/μL (100,000/μ L).
●RD:  Failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR; in subjects surviving at least 7 days following completion of Cycle 1 treatment, with evidence of persistent leukemia by [CONTACT_278618]/or bone marrow examination.
●MR:  reappearance* of ≥ 5% blasts post CR/CRi in peripheral blood or bone 
marrow or development of extramedullary disease. 
* In cases with bone marrow blast percentages of 5% – 10%, a repeat 
marrow should be performed one week later to distinguish relapse from 
bone marrow regeneration.

5.3.6 Biomarker and Optional Exploratory Research Variables 
(Not Applicable for China)
Mandatory Biomarker Research Variables
Blood and bone marrow specimens will be collected to conduct exploratory biomarker 
analyses.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_94421].  Evaluations may include the assessment of minimal residual disease levels present after therapy, analyses of biomarkers related to the pathway(s) targeted by [CONTACT_5257] (i.e., BCL-2 family protein expression levels) or biomarkers believed to be related to the disease or to drug response.  The information learned from analyzing these samples may be used to investigate factors impacting response to treatment, scientific questions related to AML or in the development of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Given the exploratory in nature of these assessments, the biomarker analyzes may or may 
not be conducted in accordance with GLP/GCP guidelines and may not be included in the clinical study report.  
Minimal or measurable residual disease (MRD), defined as persistence of leukemic cells 
after therapy, represents a potential biomarker for the depth of response to the therapy and a possible predictor for the response duration.  Given the fact that AML is a phenotypic and molecularly heterogenetic disease, a single definition for meaningful measurable disease in this patient population has yet to be identified.  Therefore, MRD may be explored in this study using two different technology platforms; multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) for a phenotypic assessment of residual disease and next generation sequencing (NGS) for a genetic assessment of leukemic-specific molecular abnormalities that would indicate residual disease.  Another consequence of the disease heterogeneity in AML is the fact that the sensitivities of these MRD assays may vary for each subject depending upon the specific phenotypic or genetic aberrancy.  Published literature suggests that most subjects are capable of achieving an MRD sensitivity of 10
–3
(Araki 2016),26therefore, this cut-off as well as others may be explored as definitions of 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104205] negativity and correlated with outcome measures of efficacy and/or overall
survival.
Overall, the goals of the biomarker analyses described in this section are to 1) determine 
the relationship between drug concentration and disease status (pharmacodynamics) and 2) identify responsive patient populations (based on subject characteristics at baseline and relapse).
Optional Exploratory Research Variables
Pharmacogenetic DNA and RNA samples may be sequenced and data analyzed for 
genetic factors contributing to the disease or the subject's response to venetoclax or other study treatment in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, and safety.  Such genetic factors may include genes for drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins, genes within the target pathway, other genes believed to be related to drug response, or genes related to the disease state.  Some genes currently insufficiently characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of analysis.  The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to venetoclax, drugs of this class, or the disease state.  The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to venetoclax, drugs of this class, or the disease state.  The results of PG analyses may not be reported with the study summary.

●Treatment failure, defined as failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR, or MLFS.
●The subject becomes pregnant while on study drug.
Treatment will be continued as long as the patient continues to derive clinical benefit or 
until documented disease progression or develops unacceptable toxicity.
Accordingly, subjects may, in rare occasions, continue treatment after documented disease 
progression if the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient.
Following the final analysis results, the subjects will be unblinded by [CONTACT_800268][INVESTIGATOR_871], or until transition to commercial supply is available, or until protocol criteria for discontinuation is met.
The investigator or study site personnel will inform [COMPANY_013] prior to discontinuing a 
subject from the study by [CONTACT_800269] 7.0.  All 
subjects will be included for analysis of safety data.
In the event that a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the study, the reason(s) for 
the discontinuation from the study and the primary reason will be recorded and a Final Treatment Visit along with all necessary procedures per Appendix C (will be performed 
as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study).  The subject would then enter

Labels must remain attached to the containers.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of venetoclax plus LDAC compared to an active control of placebo plus LDAC.  The choice of the control group allows for a double blind assessment of the contribution of venetoclax to the safety and efficacy of the backbone regimen LDAC.

as low intensity therapy for AML.  Low intensity therapy, such as LDAC, azacitidine, or decitabine are considered appropriate treatment approaches by [CONTACT_800276] (NCCN)
26and European LeukemiaNet (ELN)28for patients who are not 
candidates for intensive chemotherapy induction or HSCT.  Two Phase [ADDRESS_1104218] compared azacitidine
29and decitabine30to physician's choice therapy for older patients 
with newly diagnosed AML to evaluate if either provided a statistically significantly longer survival when given as the initial treatment for AML.  To date, neither agent has been found to provide a significantly longer survival for patients with newly diagnosed AML than for those randomized to physician choice.  The most common treatment, in both studies, amongst the patients randomized to physician choice was LDAC.  The response rates to LDAC when administered as monotherapy are substantially lower than what is seen in Study M14-[ADDRESS_1104219] been validated in cancer patients and 
include a generic HRQoL measure (EQ-5D-5L), a cancer-specific HRQoL measure that includes functional and symptom scales as well as a global health status scale (EORTC QLQ-C30), and a symptom-based measure to assess fatigue (PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a).

control arm may be enrolled.  Study M14-387, which provides the experimental arm 
projections, enrolled a similar patient population.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The selected dosage of venetoclax is based on the results from Study M14-387, an 
ongoing Phase 1b/[ADDRESS_1104222] cytarabine and anthracycline induction regimen.  In the dose escalation phase, LDAC was administered subcutaneously at 20 mg/m
2QD on 
Days 1 – 10 of each 28-day cycle of therapy.  Venetoclax began on Day 2, to allow PK assessments of monotherapy LDAC of Cycle 1 followed by a ramp up to continuous daily dosing at the designated doses of 600 mg for Cohort 1 and 800 mg for Cohort 2.  Eighteen subjects were enrolled in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion (10 subjects at the 800 mg dose and 8 subjects at 600 mg dose) and an additional 53 subjects were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study at the 600 mg dose.  Two of the 10 subjects enrolled to the 800 mg venetoclax cohort with LDAC experienced a dose-limiting toxicity identifying 600 mg venetoclax as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in co-administration with LDAC.  
An exposure-response analysis was conducted across the 71 enrolled subjects to establish 
the relationship between venetoclax exposure and response rates to support venetoclax dose selection in Study M16-043.   
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104223] 2016-003900-30
83
In summary, based on the preliminary results of exposure-response analysis and the 
observed tolerability data, the 600 mg dose of venetoclax in combination with LDAC was selected to maximize the response rates while avoiding dose-limiting toxicities.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Adjustments for Venetoclax Upon Co-Administration 
with Anti-Fungal Agents
Patients with AML are at high risk for febrile neutropenia and life threatening fungal 
infections. Azole agents, all of which are CYP3A inhibitors, are widely used in these patients for prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.  As venetoclax is predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A, co-administration with antifungal agents which are strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors will increase venetoclax exposures.   
The effect of two strong CYP3A inhibitors (posaconazole and ketoconazole) on the 
pharmacokinetics of venetoclax was evaluated in two separate studies.  Study M13-[ADDRESS_1104224] of covariates such as food and dose non-linearity on the bioavailability of venetoclax, a population PK model was used to simulate exposures of venetoclax in presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors.  
The ramp-up scheme for venetoclax when given alone is 100 mg on Day 1, 200 mg on 
Day 2, 400 mg on Day 3 and 600 mg QD from Day 4 onwards.  To match the exposures (AUC) from these doses, venetoclax doses of 10 mg on Day 1, 20 mg on Day 2 and 50 mg QD from Day 3 onwards were chosen when co-administered with strong CYP3A

considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the 
investigator will provide an alternative cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_41614].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7) regarding toxicity 
management and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV hydration) 
for the purpose of TLS prophylaxis will not be captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), unless there is an additional reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147529].
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104228] 2016-003900-30
86
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event with onset or 
worsening reported by a subject from the time that the first dose of venetoclax/placebo or LDAC is administered until [ADDRESS_1104229] elapsed following discontinuation of venetoclax/placebo and LDAC administration.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse 
event:
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would 
have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention 
had not been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26182]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to 
an outpatient facility or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678].
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104230] 2016-003900-30
87
Persistent or 
Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study 
subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but 
based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-
threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an
important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.  Deaths related to disease progression will not be recorded as adverse events.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Expected due to Study Related Endpoints
Disease progression is an endpoint of this study.  Disease progression should not be 
reported as an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Deaths
For this protocol, overall survival is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol specified adverse event collection period (Section 6.1.4) that are attributed by [CONTACT_800278].  All other deaths during the protocol specified 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104231] be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and Death eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.1.5).  All deaths occurring after adverse event collection period should be 
collected in Death eCRF.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre-existing heart disease, within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within [ADDRESS_1104232] seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.03).  When applicable, once the diagnosis is confirmed the medical term should be reported for an event rather than the abnormal lab values as identified in CTCAE.  If a reported adverse event increases in severity, the initial adverse event should be given final outcome date and a new adverse event must be reported to reflect the change in severity.  If a reported adverse event increases in severity, the initial adverse event should be given final outcome date and a new adverse event must be reported to reflect the change in severity such that the dates on these AE's cannot overlap.  For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, the supplemental eCRFs also need to be updated to reflect any changes due to the increase in severity.

For adverse events not captured by [CONTACT_416992], the following 
should be used:
Grade [ADDRESS_1104234] (mild).
Grade [ADDRESS_1104235]'s 
usual activities (moderate).
Grade [ADDRESS_1104236]'s usual activities and may be incapacitating (moderate to severe).
Grade 4 The adverse event is life-threatening requiring urgent intervention (severe).
Grade [ADDRESS_1104237] (severe).
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgement, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship. 
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgement, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
The Investigator will assess the relationship of each adverse event to venetoclax/placebo, 
and to LDAC.  Some events may be reasonably related to more than one drug or to none.  For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the Investigator has not reported causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated to study drug.

6.1.7 Toxicity Management
Management of Cytopenias, Infections, and Other Adverse Events
Myelosuppression and the related adverse events (thrombocytopenia, anemia, 
neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia) are common in both treated and untreated subjects with AML.  Subjects with baseline neutropenia or have significant bone marrow involvement may be particularly at high risk.  If a participant achieves a CRi or a morphologic leukemia free bone marrow, and has Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia persisting beyond Day 28, venetoclax should be interrupted from Day 28 until ANC ≥ 500 – 1000/ μL and platelet count ≥ 25 – 100 × 10
3/μL.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], if 
persistent AML remains in the bone marrow, concurrent cytopenias are thought to be attributable to the disease process of AML and continued treatment with venetoclax and 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104245] with previous CR 
presents with new onset Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting more than one week, unless it is due to the underlying disease, venetoclax dosing may be interrupted until ANC recovery to ≥ 500 – 1000/ μL and platelet count ≥ 25 – 100 × 10
3/μL per 
investigator discretion in consultation with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor.  Venetoclax may be re-initiated at a lower dose, or discontinued if a minimal dose is not tolerable, per discussion with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor.
Administration of venetoclax in subjects with lymphoproliferative disorders has been 
associated with clinically significant lymphopen ia (B and T lymphocyte subtypes).  Anti-
infective prophylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial or Pneumocystis infections are required for all subjects with ANC of < 500/ μL.  Institutional infectious organisms and their drug 
resistance patterns should primarily be considered and the choice of these agents should be based on regional guidelines or institutional standards.  Potential for drug-drug interactions should be considered.  Please refer to Table 1, Table 2, and Appendix I for a 
description of excluded and cautionary medications and implement dose reductions for venetoclax/placebo as necessary.
If a subject is continuing to respond based on the bone marrow assessment after Cycle 2 
of treatment, but has persistent cytopenias (cytopenias that occur after Day 28 of a Cycle during Cycle 2 and beyond), venetoclax dose may be reduced as follows:
Table 7. Dose Reduction Guidelines for Management of Persistent 
Neutropenia or Thrombocytopenia

M16-[ADDRESS_1104246] Therapy:  Low – Dose Cytarabine
In a recent international clinical trial, subjects receiving LDAC experienced the following 
treatment emergent CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_1104247] 10%:  thrombocytopenia 35%, anemia 27%, febrile neutropenia 25%, disease progression 22%, neutropenia 20%, pneumonia 19%, general physical health deterioration 16%, and leukopenia 10%.
[ADDRESS_1104248] experiences myelosuppression associated complications, such as those described below:
●Febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5°C and ANC < 1,000/ μL)
●Active viral, bacterial or fungal infection (i.e., requiring IV anti-infectives or 
extensive supportive care)
●Hemorrhage (gastrointestinal, genito-urinary, pulmonary with platelets 
< 25,000/μ L or any central nervous system hemorrhage)
Treatment with LDAC may be resumed once the above conditions have improved or have 
been stabilized with adequate treatment (anti-infective therapy, transfusions, or growth factors).
Myelosuppression caused by [CONTACT_800281]. Complete blood and platelet counts 
should be performed regularly, as clinically indicated and prior to each treatment cycle.

In the presence of myelosuppression or its complications, treatment with LDAC may be 
interrupted or supportive measures instituted.
LDAC dose reductions are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_203777].  If a dose reduction is believed to 
be necessary a discussion with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor is required.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)
There is a potential risk for TLS in subjects with AML, especially in those with elevated 
leukocyte count, circulating blasts, elevated pretreatment LDH levels, renal dysfunction, and dehydration.  In addition, on-target effect of venetoclax could lead to rapid cell death and pose a risk of TLS.  To mitigate the risk for TLS all subjects enrolled in the study will need TLS prophylaxis and monitoring.  Prophylactic reductions of potassium, inorganic phosphorus or uric acid above normal range are recommended prior to beginning study treatment and continue based on the ongoing risk of TLS.  For subjects at higher risk for TLS (i.e., circulating blasts, high burden of leukemia involvement in bone marrow, elevated pretreatment LDH levels, or renal dysfunction), additional mitigation measures including more intensive laboratory monitoring and interventions should be implemented.  Lower starting dose of venetoclax/placebo may be considered (i.e., 50 mg).
Below are the minimum requirements for TLS prophylaxis and management for all 
subjects enrolled into the study.   All other prophylaxis and monitoring procedures for 
TLS will be implemented as per regional guidelines/institutional standards:
●All subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_778666] [ADDRESS_1104250] for 24 hours after reaching the final dose of venetoclax.
●All subjects must receive uric acid reducing agent, adequate oral and 
intravenous hydration as tolerated while monitoring the fluid status of the 
subject prior to and during the ramp up of venetoclax/placebo.  The uric acid reducing agent, type of fluids and the rate of infusion will be determined by [CONTACT_800282].
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104251] 2016-003900-30

●TLS chemistry tests to be drawn (calcium, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, 
uric acid, and creatinine) on the first day of venetoclax/placebo dosing and 
each day of a new dose at 0 (within 4 hours prior to dosing) and 6 – [ADDRESS_1104252] dose.
●Additional laboratory assessments may be performed, per investigator discretion, post-dose during ramp up and up to 48 hours after reaching final dose if clinically indicated.
●Abnormal chemistry tests during ramp up should be corrected promptly.
●If a subject meets criteria for clinically significant laboratory or clinical TLS, please follow institutional guidelines or recommendations in Appendix G .  No 
additional venetoclax/placebo dose should be administered until resolution.  For continued dosing of venetoclax/placebo, monitor for evidence of TLS during study treatment, and manage abnormalities of serum creatinine and 
electrolytes promptly.
For continued dosing of venetoclax/placebo, monitor for evidence of TLS during 
treatment, and manage abnormalities of serum creatinine, uric acid and electrolytes promptly.  For subjects at higher risk (i.e., circulating blasts), more intensive measures should considered.

Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104257] stratified by [CONTACT_800270] (secondary, de novo) and age (18 – < 75, ≥ 75).
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Fixed sequence testing procedure will be used for analyses of the secondary efficacy 
endpoints.  If statistical test is not significant for the primary efficacy endpoint of OS, then statistical significance will not be declared for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints.  Secondary efficacy endpoints are CR + CRi rate, CR + CRh rate, CR + CRi rate by [CONTACT_800239] 2, CR + CRh rate by [CONTACT_800239] 2, CR rate, fatigue based on the PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a, a global health status/quality of life scale (GHS/QoL) scale from the EORTC QLQ-C30, event free survival (EFS), transfusion independence rates for RBC or platelets, CR + CRi and MRD response rate, CR + CRh and MRD response rate, CR + CRi rate in biomarker subgroups (e.g., FLT3, IDH1/2), CR + CRh rate in biomarker subgroups (e.g., FLT3, IDH1/2), and OS in biomarker subgroups (e.g., FLT3, IDH1/2).  To adjust for multiple testing of the key secondary efficacy endpoints, a fixed sequence testing procedure will be used.  The key secondary efficacy endpoints and corresponding ranking will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).
The proportion of subjects with complete remission or complete remission with 
incomplete blood count recovery (CR + CRi) will be calculated based on the modified IWG criteria for AML.  CR + CRi rate will be compared between treatment arms using CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_800270] (secondary, de novo) and age (18 – < 75, ≥ 75).  In 
addition, 95% confidence interval will be constructed for CR + CRi.
CRh (Complete remission with partial hematologic recovery) is a derived response based 
on bone marrow blast and hematology lab values.  A response of CRh is achieved when the following criteria are met:
●Bone marrow with < 5% blasts

●Peripheral blood platelet count of > 0.5 × 105/μL*
●A 1 week ( ≥ 7 days) platelet transfusion-free period prior to the hematology 
lab collection
* For a bone marrow sample collected before the last cycle of study treatment, the hematology lab results collected 
from the date of the bone marrow sample collection up to the Day 1 of a subsequent cycle of study treatment will 
be used for CRh analysis.
* For a bone marrow sample collected during or after the last cycle of study treatment, the hematology lab results 
collected within 14 days after bone marrow sample collection date will be used for CRh analysis.
The proportion of subjects with complete remission or complete remission with partial 
hematological recovery (CR + CRh) will be calculated based on the modified IWG criteria for AML.  CR + CRh rate will be compared between treatment arms using CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_800270] (secondary, de novo) and age (18 - < 75, ≥ 75).  In addition,

Quality of life will be assessed using the GHS/QoL scale from the EORTC QLQ-C30.  
Scores will be computed according to procedures outlined in the EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring manual, available at http://groups.eortc.be/qol/manuals.  A linear mixed effects regression model with a variable covariance structure will be fitted to the longitudinal data to test for differences between treatment arms.
EFS will be defined as the number of days from randomization to the date of progressive 
disease, relapse from CR to CRi, treatment failure defined as failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR, or MFLS, or death from any cause.  If a specified event does not occur, subjects will be censored at the date of last disease assessment.  Data for subjects without any disease assessments performed after randomization will be censored at the date of randomization.  The distribution of EFS will be estimated for each treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier methodology and compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test stratified by [CONTACT_800270] (secondary, de novo) and age (18 – < 75, ≥ 75).
Post baseline transfusion independence rate will be calculated as the portion of subjects who achieved transfusion independence post baseline.  Transfusion independence is defined as a period of at least [ADDRESS_1104261]-baseline transfusion independent from baseline transfusion dependence.  The transfusion independence rate will be evaluated for 1) RBC and 2) platelets.  All randomized subjects will be included to estimate the post-baseline transfusion independence rate.  
Post baseline transfusion independence rate will be estimated as the proportion of subjects 
known to achieve transfusion independence during the evaluation period.  Transfusion independence rate will be compared between treatment arms using CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_800270] (secondary, de novo) and age (18 – < 75, ≥ 75).  In addition, 95% confidence 
interval will be constructed for transfusion independence rate.

addition, 95% confidence interval will be constructed for CR + CRh rate by [CONTACT_800239] 2.
The proportion of subjects achieving CR + CRi and MRD or CR + CRh and MRD 
response status may be calculated.  All randomized subjects will be included in the analyses.  Subjects who are randomized but have no MRD assessment will be considered as non-negative for the calculation of MRD response status.  MRD response will be defined using a threshold of less than 10
–3of residual blasts per leukocytes as measured in 
bone marrow.  The MRD response rates may be compared between treatment arms using CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_800270] (secondary, de novo) and age (18 – < 75, ≥ 75).  In 
addition, 95% confidence interval will be constructed. 
The response rates (e.g., CR + CRi, CR + CRh, or CR) and overall survival in molecular 
subgroups (e.g., IDH1/2, FLT3) may be evaluated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint
Exploratory analyses comparing the effects of venetoclax + LDAC versus placebo + 
LDAC will be performed on the following PRO measures:  EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30, and PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a.  Descriptive statistics will be calculated as per the scoring manuals for all scales/items of the EORTC QLQ-C30, PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a, the EQ-5D-5L utility score, and the EQ-5D VAS score at each assessment.

addition, the percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event at a given NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.03 toxicity grade and relationship to study drug will be provided.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse events will be summarized as described for Adverse Events above.
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
The number of subject deaths will be summarized (1) for all deaths in this study 
regardless of the number of days after the last dose of venetoclax.  (2) for deaths occurring within 30 days of randomization, (3) for deaths occurring within 60 days of randomization, (4) for deaths occurring within [ADDRESS_1104267] dose of venetoclax, and (5) for deaths occurring more than [ADDRESS_1104268] dose of venetoclax.
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Tests and Vital Signs
Changes from baseline will be analyzed for each scheduled post-baseline visit and for the 
final visit for blood chemistry and hematology parameters, as well as vital sign parameters.  If more than one measurement exists for a subject on a particular day, then an arithmetic average will be calculated.  This average will be considered to be that subject's measurement for that day.  Post-baseline measurements more than [ADDRESS_1104269]-baseline measurements will not be included. 
Where applicable, blood chemistry and hematology laboratory determinations will be 
categorized according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) grades, and shifts from baseline NCI CTCAE grades to maximum and final post-baseline grades will be assessed.  The baseline and final grades will be defined respectively as the grade of the last measurement collected prior to the first dose of study drug, and as the last post-baseline measurement collected no more than [ADDRESS_1104270] baseline grades of 3 to 4 
Venetoclax (ABT-199)
M16-[ADDRESS_1104271] baseline will be provided.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The primary endpoint of the study is overall survival and sample size calculation is based 
on the following assumptions:
●Median OS of 6 months for placebo plus LDAC arm
●Median OS of 11 months for venetoclax plus LDAC arm (hazard ratio of 
0.545)
●Interim analysis of OS at 75% of death events with O'Brien-Fleming boundary
●2:1 randomization ratio to venetoclax plus LDAC, and placebo plus LDAC arm
With the above assumptions, a total of 133 death events will provide 90% power to detect 
statistically significant different between treatment arms at alpha level of 0.05.  A total of approximately 210 subjects (140 in venetoclax plus LDAC arm and 70 in placebo plus LDAC arm) will be randomized into the study to obtain the 133 death events.

Internet access to the ePRO data will be provided by [CONTACT_94539].  This access will be available for the duration of the study to the site investigator, as well as delegated personnel.  Such access will be removed from investigator sites following the receipt of the study archive.  Data from the ePRO system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper print-outs from that media.
The ePRO data will be collected electronically via a tablet device into which the patient 
will directly enter the required pi[INVESTIGATOR_94470].  The electronic device will be programmed to allow data entry for only the visits specified in the protocol and will not allow for patients to complete more than one of the same assessments at any one visit.  All data entered on the device will be immediately stored to the device itself and automatically uploaded to a central server administrated by [CONTACT_51070].

* Laboratory TLS requires two or more metabolic abnormalities must be present during the same 24-hour period 
within [ADDRESS_1104320].
** Clinical TLS requires the presence of Laboratory TLS plus one or more findings from the Clinical TLS column.
# Corrected calcium = measured calcium level in mg/dL + 0.8 × (4 – albumin in gm/dL).
! Acute kidney injury, unless attributable to another cause, represents clinical TLS even if criteria for laboratory TLS 
are not satisfied.
*** Not directly or probably attributable to therapeutic agent.
† If no institutional ULN is specified, age/sex ULN creatinine may be defined as follows:  > 1 to < 12 years of age, 
both male and female, 61.6 μmol/L; ≥ 12 to < 16 years, both male and female, 88 μmol/L; ≥ 16 years, female

Abnormality Management Recommendations
Hyperkalemia (including rapi[INVESTIGATOR_26696])
Potassium ≥ 0.5 mmol/L 
increase from prior value 
(even if potassium within normal limits [WNL])•Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine in 1 hour STAT.  If further ≥ 0.2 mmol/L increase in potassium, but still 
< upper limit of normal (ULN), manage as per potassium ≥ ULN.  
Otherwise recheck in 1 hour.
•Resume per protocol testing if change in potassium is < 0.2 mmol/L, and potassium < ULN, and no other evidence of tumor lysis.
•At discretion of investigator, may recheck prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  If stable or decreased, and still WNL, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_197756].  Potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine must be rechecked within 24 hours.
Potassium > upper limit of normal•Perform STAT ECG and commence telemetry.
•Nephrology (or other acute dialysis service) notification with consideration of initiating dialysis.
•Administer Kayexalate 60 g (or Resonium A 60 g).
•Administer furosemide 20 mg IV × 1.
•Administer calcium gluconate 100 – 200 mg/kg IV slowly if there is ECG/telemetry evidence of life-threatening arrhythmias.
•Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine in 1 hour STAT.
•If potassium < ULN 1 hour later, repeat potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine 1, 2 and 4 hours, if no other evidence of tumor lysis.
Potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L 
(6.0 mEq/L) and/or symptomatic (e.g., muscle cramps, weakness, paresthesias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)•Perform STAT ECG and commence telemetry.
•Nephrology (or other acute dialysis service) assessment with consideration of initiating dialysis.
•Administer Kayexalate 60 g (or Resonium A 60 g).
•Administer furosemide 20 mg IV × 1.
•Administer insulin 0.1 U/kg IV + D25 2 mL/kg IV.
•Administer sodium bicarbonate 1 – 2 mEq/kg IV push.
•If sodium bicarbonate is used, rasburicase should not be used as this may exacerbate calcium phosphate precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332].
•Administer calcium gluconate 100 – 200 mg/kg IV slowly if there is ECG/telemetry evidence of life-threatening arrhythmias.  Do not administer in same IV line as sodium bicarbonate.
•Recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and creatinine every hour STAT.

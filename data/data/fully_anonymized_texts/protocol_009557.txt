This study is designed to compare the accuracy of a noninvasive  measurement of oxygen  saturation compared to 
reference values obtained by a laboratory blood gas analyzer.  Arterial blood samples will be collected from 
healthy adult subjects while undergoing a desaturation procedur e wherein the concentration of oxygen inhaled is 
slowly reduced until the subject’s arterial oxygen concentratio n is approximately 70%.  During the desaturation, 
the subject’s hand and arm without the arterial line will be su bjected to motion. After completing the 
desaturation, the gas mixture will be returned to room air conc entrations.

 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
 This document is a protocol for a clinical research study spons ored by [CONTACT_138479].  The study will be 
conducted in compliance with all stipulations of this protocol,  the conditions of IRB approval, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR 
Part 56, 21 CFR Part 812, ISO-[ZIP_CODE], and International Conferen ce on Harmonisation E6 Good Clinical Practice (ICH 
GCP). 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submitted to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval.  Appr oval of both the protocol and the consent form must 
be obtained before any participant is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by 
[CONTACT_3484].   
1. PURPOSE 
The objective of this study is to compare the noninvasive oxyge n saturation (SpO
2) performance of the Masimo 
noninvasive INVSENSOR00012 sensor against an arterial blood sam ple analyzed by a laboratory CO-oximeter 
reference instrument.  Data using the noninvasive devices will be collected from healthy volunteers undergoing a 
desaturation procedure. 
This is a nonrandomized single arm study wherein all subjects a re enrolled into the experimental arm and receive 
the INVSENSOR00012 sensor on one or more fingers.  Desaturation  will be conducted by [CONTACT_531610] a controlled manner to obtain noninvasive oxygen saturation readings, SpO 2, 
at various levels.  Reference blood samples will be repeatedly collected from the subject and analyzed using a 
standard laboratory CO-oximeter.  During the desaturation, the subject’s hand and arm without the arterial line will 
be subjected to motion. 
Outcome Measure:  
Performance of the sensors will be determined by [CONTACT_531611] 
(SpO 2) of the pulse oximeter sensors to the arterial oxygen saturati on (SaO2) value obtained from a reference blood 
sample and calculating the A RMS value per ISO-[ZIP_CODE]-2-61. The acceptance criteria will be ARMS  ≤ 3 %SpO2 across a 
saturation range of 70-100 %SpO2 under motion conditions. 
2. BACKGROUND 
Masimo Corporation develops non-invasive medical technologies.  These devices have applications in the operating 
room, critical care unit, emergency room, emergency transport v ehicles, as well as physician’s offices. 
 
An invasive blood sample analyzed by a CO-oximeter reference in strument gives the best measure of arterial oxygen 
concentration as well as other blood solutes, but cannot  measu re these parameters continuously and requires skin 
puncture, arterial line placement and subsequent risk of infect ion, hematoma, and other physiological damage.  
Masimo SET and Masimo Rainbow technologies allow real-time, non -invasive monitoring of oxygen saturation (and 
other blood solutes) and has the potential to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the cost of care and risks to 
both patients and clinicians associated with arterial and venou s punctures. 
2.1. Technology Background 
 Pulse oximetry is governed by [CONTACT_371330]: 
x Oxyhemoglobin (oxygenated blood) and deoxyhemoglobin (non-oxyge nated blood) differ in their 
absorption of red and infrared light (spectrophotometry).

 x The amount of arterial blood in tissue changes with arterial pu lses (photoplethysmography).  Therefore, 
the amount of light absorbed by [CONTACT_531612].  
x The CO-Oximeter utilizes a sensor with various light-emitting d iodes (LEDs) that pass light through the 
site to a photodiode (detector).  See figure below.   
 
 
x Signal data is obtained by [CONTACT_531613] a capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996] (for example, 
a fingertip, a hand, a foot) and measuring changes in light abs orption during the blood pulsatile cycle.  
The maximum radiant power of the strongest light is limited to ≤ 25mW.  The detector receives the light, 
converts it into an electronic signal and sends it to the Masim o hardware (e.g. Rad-57, Radical-7) for 
calculation.  Once the oximeter receives the signal from the se nsor, it utilizes Masimo SET signal 
extraction technology for calculation of the patient’s function al oxygen saturation, pulse rate and other 
blood parameters. 
2.2. Study Devices 
Investigational sensor : INVSENSOR00012 
The INVSENSOR00012 sensor is a modification to Masimo’s SpO2 Re usable line of sensors.  These sensors 
use red and infrared LEDs to calculate SpO2 values. INVSENSOR00 [ADDRESS_690248] or sensor that utilizes the same optical 
components as the FDA cleared sensors.  This study will validat e that the new sensor design meets the 
accuracy requirements for SpO2 under motion conditions when com pared to laboratory reference CO-
oximeter SaO2 values(A RMS ≤ 3 %SpO2). 
 
FDA Cleared Sensors and Devices:

the device accountability log.  Any discrepancies noted will be  investigated, resolved, and 
documented prior to return or destruction of unused study devic es.  Devices destroyed on site will 
only be upon written instruction from the sponsor and will be d ocumented in the study files. 
13. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
13.1. Benefits: There will be no benefit to the subject.  Other possi ble benefits would be to society as a 
whole.  Evaluation of the accuracy of this new device could ena ble healthcare workers to more 
appropriately treat potentially life threatening conditions. 
13.2. Device Risks: The noninvasive devices used in this study are si milar in technology and design to 
some commercially available pulse oximeters and other non-invas ive devices and hence have the 
same risks.  Pulse oximeters and other non-invasive devices are  commonly used and are considered 
to be minimal risk.  There is an extremely small risk of damage  to the subject’s fingers, or other 
locations where sensors are placed, from the device including t emporary skin irritation or 
discomfort associated with exposure to the sensor as well as po tential temporary mechanical 
irritation or discomfort.  There is a remote, yet possible, ris k of a burn from the sensor. In the case of 
a sensor burn there is the potential for permanent skin damage (scar/discoloration). 
13.3. Venous Cannulation Risks: swelling, infection, infiltration of fluids/ blood into area surrounding IV, 
bruising, hematoma, lightheadedness, fainting, feeling flush/wa rm, feeling nauseated, throwing up, 
sudden drop in blood pressure/sudden increase in blood pressure , sudden drop in heart 
rate/sudden increa se in heart rate, tingl ing sensation of face,  arms and/or legs, sweating, mouth 
dryness, damage to the blood  vessel and surrounding nerves or t issue. 
13.4. Arterial Cannulation risks: decreas ed blood supply, blood clot,  embolization, infection, hematoma, 
damage to the blood vessel and surrounding nerves, tendons or t issue; loss of feeling in hand and/or 
arm and even the loss of hand due to rare complications of the study. 
13.5. Blood Draw risks: discomfort is generally associated with needl e puncture.  The most common 
complications associated with blood draws and capi[INVESTIGATOR_531608].  All blood 
draws will be performed by [CONTACT_5944].  An ACLS certif ied physician will be in attendance 
throughout the entire procedure, and the study will be complete d under their general supervision.  
Other anticipated adverse events that may occur, include but ar e not limited to: vasovagal (passing 
out/fainting), infection to the skin or area right below the sk in, lightheadedness, feeling flush/ warm, 
feeling nauseated, throwing up, seizures, sudden drop in blood pressure/ sudden increase in blood 
pressure, sudden drop in h eart rate/ sudden increase in heart r ate, tingling sensation of face/arms 
and/or sweating, and mouth dryness.  These anticipated adverse events are expected to be 
temporary.

 13.6. Risk From Oxygen Administration:  There are no risks associated  with high oxygen/oxygen 
administration for less than [ADDRESS_690279] any cardiac conditions, COPD 
or any other lung diseases.  Subjects’ answers on the health qu estionnaire will help the medical staff 
decide if they can safely participate in this study; subjects a re encouraged to let the study staff know 
if they have any concerns. 
13.7. Low Oxygen Concentration Risks: Risks associated with hypoxia i nclude dizziness, shortness of 
breath, drowsiness, or headache. If or when this occurs, the st udy can be stopped. There is an 
extremely small risk of loss of consciousness, damage to vital organs, or death from lack of oxygen. 
The study shall be stopped by [CONTACT_138495] g before this could occur.  Other 
anticipated adverse events that may occur, include but are not limited to:  vasovagal (passing 
out/fainting), lightheadedness, feeling nauseated, throwing up,  seizures, sudden drop in blood 
pressure/sudden increase in blood pressure, sudden drop in hear t rate/sudden increase in heart 
rate, tingling sensation of face, arms and/or legs, sweating, m outh dryness.  These anticipated 
adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
13.8. Nose Clip Risks: It is expected that some people will have disc omfort/ pi[INVESTIGATOR_38633]/ scratches from 
wearing a nose clip. If this occurs, adjustments can be made an d/or the study can be stopped. 
13.9. Risk from Inflicted Knowledge: The risk of inflicted medical kn owledge to subjects is negligible since 
we deidentify all associated sample information including those  relevant to our clinical and 
engineering parameter studies.  The monitoring and test results  are not examined for diagnostic 
purposes and do not reflect an attempt to ascertain any subject 's medical condition.  The attending 
physician's role during this study is to ensure the safety of t he subject during the study. Subjects are 
informed that these are not diagnostic tools, if observations a re made using FDA cleared devices we 
will refer them to their primary care physician. 
13.10.  Risk From Loss of Confidentiality: Masimo upholds the highest s tandards to protect hard and 
electronic data however, a complete promise for confidentiality  cannot be guaranteed due to 
unforeseeable events. 
13.11.  Risk From Additional Testing: 
13.11.1.  During the conduct of the study, it is possible, but not likely , that someone could become 
exposed to the sample of blood drawn from the subject through a n inadvertent needle 
stick or by [CONTACT_138496]. In such circumstances, it  will be important to the 
exposed individual to know whether the blood to which he or she  was exposed contained 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
and additional testing of the sample will be performed. 
13.11.2.  Within the consent, subjects will agree to permit the company t o test the blood sample 
(or samples) by [CONTACT_44210].  The test results will be maintained as confidential 
and will only be used by [CONTACT_138497].  
13.11.3.  In the case that Masimo needs to contact a subject regarding ad ditional testing they will be 
contact[CONTACT_426] a Masimo employee and medical personnel can be ava ilable for further 
counsel if requested.  
13.11.4.  The cost for the initial testing and compensation for their tim e/travel to the testing facility 
will be the only things paid for by [CONTACT_108573].

 13.12.  Lidocaine (injection) Risks:  Insertion of the Lidocaine may be  discomforting and can feel like a slight 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_531609] a warm/burning sensation.  Other anticipated a dverse events that may occur, 
include but are not limited to: Flushing or redness of the skin , itching skin, small red or purple spots 
on the skin, unusually warm skin, bruising, bleeding at the app lication site, and swelling. These 
adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
13.13.  Although not common, it is also possible to have an allergic re action to injectable lidocaine.  
Subjects should not take part in this study if they are allergi c to lidocaine injection or other types of 
numbing medicine, or if they have a heart rhythm disorder such as Wolff-Parkinson-White 
Syndrome or Stokes-Adams syndrome.  Subjects are instructed to tell the study staff right away if 
they experience hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your f ace, lips, tongue or throat. 
13.14.  Ethyl Chloride (Lidocaine Spray): Ethyl Chloride is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] a nesthetic which is used to prevent pain 
by [CONTACT_138498]. Although unlikely, the anticipated adverse  events that may occur, include but 
are not limited to: changes in skin color (i.e. Flushing or red ness of the skin), delayed wound healing, 
rash, itching and swelling.  These adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
14. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES  
The physician and nurse present during the study will be ACLS c ertified and will respond to any medical 
emergency involving a subject with the ACLS approved protocol f or intervention.  A crash cart is on site and 
full emergency services are within [ADDRESS_690280] be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].

Date:  4/20/ [ADDRESS_150775] one site will be contaminated with 
MS2 in ~60 % of  control group participants.   A power calculation indicated that 17 patients per 
group would provide 80% pow er to detect a 75% reduction in contamination from 60% to 15%.  
Linear and generalized linear mixed -effects models controlling for time of collection and site of 
contamination w ill be  used to compare the percentages and average log 10 PFU levels of 
contamination for the groups .  Bivariate analyses w ill be  conducted to compare  characteristics of 
groups.  Fisher’s exact test w ill be  used for  categorical data and the Student paired t -test for 
normally distributed data.   Analyses w ill be  performed using R version 3.5.1 statistical software 
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)  and functions from the lme4 and 
lmerTest packages will be implemented .

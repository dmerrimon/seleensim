 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   5 PRÉCIS Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults.[ADDRESS_672920] will recruit 60 sedentary older adults between 55-80 years of age with early MCI. Based on the Surgeon General’s recommendation for moderate-intensity aerobic in older adults,14-15 participants will be randomly assigned to: aerobic walking for 30 mins, 5 days/week for 6 months OR health education non-active control for 6 months, with 30 participants in each arm. Primary outcome measurements include regional brain activity in the hippocampus and behavioral performance on the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST).16-17 Additionally, we will examine secondary outcomes of physical function, aerobic fitness, amyloid burden, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) associated with exercise.18-21 For exploratory purposes, all participants will be scanned with amyloid and tau PET tracers at baseline and follow-up to examine the contribution of amyloid and tau aggregation on brain function and to serve as an AD risk biomarker.    Study Title  Lifestyle Enriching Activities for Research in Neuroscience intervention trial (LEARNit)  Objectives  The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of modifiable lifestyle factors including exercise and healthy living education on brain health. The investigators will compare 2 types of interventions, moderate aerobic walking vs. healthy living education reading, over 6 months to evaluate changes in brain function, cognition, and physical function in older adults with cognitive concerns.        Our primary outcomes are neuroimaging measures of brain function after a 6--month exercise intervention, including regional BOLD activity and performance on a memory task, with secondary outcomes of brain derived neurotrophic factor, amyloid PET, physical function and aerobic fitness. We will link biological changes to meaningful clinical outcomes by [CONTACT_518743] 3.0 April 26, 2024   6 the relationship between enhanced brain function, improved memory performance and physical function after the intervention.    Primary outcomes. Based on the goals and innovation of this proposal, our primary outcomes are neuroimaging measure of brain function: fMRI BOLD signal in the hippocampus. Functional MRI has proven to be an effective non-invasive, in-vivo tool for measuring brain function. 22-[ADDRESS_672921]-intervention (at baseline and 6 month follow-up).   Design and Outcomes    This trial is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of aerobic exercise on brain signal and memory function in individuals 55-80 years of age.  Interventions and Duration  There will be two arms:   Moderate aerobic walking OR Health education reading  Participants will engage in the arm specific intervention activities for the duration of the 6-month intervention. There will be two study visits, one at baseline and one at the end of the 6-month intervention.  Sample Size and Population  LEARNit will recruit [ADDRESS_672922] any contraindications for MRI. Subjects will be randomized to one of the two arms, stratified by [CONTACT_291292]4 status.

 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_672929] differences in hippocampal brain signal and performance relative to the health education control arm.  1.2 Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives will examine change in outcomes of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), amyloid PET, physical function and aerobic fitness after a 6-month exercise intervention. We hypothesize that the exercise arm will have differences in amyloid PET accumulation, higher BDNF levels and improved aerobic fitness relative to the health education control arm.  2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects 36 million people worldwide.1 Results from several large pharmacological trials prompted a paradigm shift to initiate treatment earlier in AD. 2-3 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a preclinical stage of AD, may be an optimal period for initiating treatment. Exercise has emerged as an exciting, lifestyle intervention to help remediate cognitive loss or delay onset of dementia.8-[ADDRESS_672930] shown over a decade ago when aerobic walking improved executive function after 6 months, relative to stretching.30 Increases in gray and white matter brain volume after a 6-month aerobic exercise intervention were later reported, and this finding was corroborated by a recent 12-month aerobic exercise study that showed increased hippocampal volume, improved memory function, and increased BDNF in healthy older adults.28,37 Overall, the majority of studies on exercise that examined brain volume and cognition were in healthy older adults, leaving exercise effects on brain mechanisms in at-risk populations, such as MCI, largely unexplored. In a home-based exercise intervention, MCI patients were randomized to an exercise of choice, usually walking, or to a usual care control arm. The walking arm improved on the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- cognitive subscale) by 0.[ADDRESS_672931] will recruit 60 sedentary older adults between 55-80 years of age with early MCI. Based on the Surgeon General’s recommendation for moderate-intensity aerobic in older adults, participants will be randomly assigned to: aerobic walking for 30 mins, 5 days/week for 6 months OR health education non-active control for 6 months, with 30 participants in each arm.14-15 Primary outcome measurements include regional brain activity in the hippocampus and behavioral performance on the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). Additionally, we will examine secondary outcomes of brain volume, amyloid burden, cognition and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) associated with exercise. Importantly, all participants will be scanned with amyloid and tau PET tracers at baseline and follow-up to examine the contribution of amyloid and tau aggregation on brain function and to serve as an AD risk biomarker.  3 STUDY DESIGN LEARNit is a single-site, single-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of moderate aerobic walking (55-80% target HR) versus healthy living education reading in older adults who perform at least [ADDRESS_672932] deviation below normative values for their age (N=60). Intervention is performed at home or in the participant’s local community (e.g., home or neighborhood). Intervention duration is 6 months. Randomization for this single-blind study was achieved using a permuted block schema with block sizes of 2 and 4. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either aerobic walking or healthy living education arms and stratified by [CONTACT_291292]4 carrier status (yes/no) based on saliva APOE phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   12 9. Contraindications to MRI scan (e.g., pacemaker). 4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from the community using local media outlets, like the newspaper, radio, flyers and local community groups, including senior centers, retirement communities and churches. The projected enrollment is 25 participants per year. Screening and Eligibility Criteria: All study candidates will first be telephone-screened for information on demographics, exercise level, medications, and MRI contraindications. If eligible after the telephone screening, participants will receive an in-person evaluation including a detailed history, neuropsychological screening battery assessing memory and executive function. Screening for depression will be done using the self-report 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Participants will be deemed eligible, meeting criteria for a diagnosis of cognitive decline, when performance on at least one measure of the neuropsychological battery is one standard deviation below age, education and gender matched norms.  Screening Records: Detailed documentation for all subjects who are screened will be kept in the REDCap database including ineligibility documentation.  Eligibility Criteria: A summary of each participant’s in-person screening and eligibility data is included in the REDCap database in the Screening Key form. Consenting: Consent will be obtained from participants at the beginning of the Screening Visit prior to any testing. The Project Manager, Coordinator or PI [INVESTIGATOR_518735] (IFC) with participants. One of the collaborating MDs (e.g., [CONTACT_518755]) will be available to answer questions (by [CONTACT_518744]) and will sign the consent form.  A copy of the signed consent form will be offered to all participants for their records. The original signed consent form will be stored in a locked cabinet in the PI’s office. Randomization: Randomization for this single-blind study was achieved using a permuted block schema with block sizes of 2 and 4. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either aerobic walking or healthy living education arms and stratified by [CONTACT_291292]4 carrier status (yes/no) based on saliva APOE phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   13 5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  At-home Walking Program: Participants enrolled in the at-home walking program will have a program tailored to them. A trained exercise therapi[INVESTIGATOR_518736] a period of [ADDRESS_672935] 6 weeks subjects will engage in walking exercises that gradually increase in duration up to 150 minutes/week. The interventionist will work closely with the subject during this period to ensure proper safety, positioning, and intensity. From week 6 and on, participants will continue walking at 150 minutes/week. At the end of the study, subjects will receive a packet of reading materials for the at-home health education program to independently engage in the other intervention program, if they wish. At-home Health Education Program: Participants will be asked to participate in an at -home health education program for a period of [ADDRESS_672936], completed online or by [CONTACT_648].  5.2 Handling of Study Interventions   Aerobic Walking Arm:  The aerobic group will participate in aerobic walking for a total of 3-5 days/week for 6 months. There is a misconception of what constitutes beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of aerobics. It is exercise intensity level that determines heart rate.  The target heart rate range for participants in the aerobic training group is 60 to 75% of their maximum heart rate. Since all participants are [ADDRESS_672937] much, if any, prior aerobic experience. The aerobic walking program is detailed below. Each session will include warm-up, aerobic, and cool-down periods.   Components of Aerobic Training Exercise:  
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   14 Warm-up (5 minutes) – Each exercise session will begin with an easy warm-up. Instruct the participant to use a heart rate zone of less than 50% of Max Heart Rate to guide your warm-up.  As a general guideline, a warm-up can be something as simple as walking for 5 minutes at a slower pace.    Aerobic Segment (30 minutes) – The objective is to increase subjects’ heart rates to 60% to 75% of their maximum. Subjects will measure their heart rate at [ADDRESS_672938] their heart rates and perceived exertion in their Exercise Diaries.   Cool-down (5 min) – Aerobic activity should always be followed by a cool-down period. The participant will slow down walking speed in the last [ADDRESS_672939] the participant to “slow down your movement and try to get your heart rate back down to less than 50% of Max Heart Rate. “ Perceived exertion should be checked again to be sure everybody is recovering adequately  Progression of Aerobic Exercise:  Ideally participants will progress the walking program over the first 4 weeks with the following schedule: weeks 1-[ADDRESS_672940] of 40 minutes for 2 days/week (including 5 minutes warm-up, cool-down and 30 minutes of continuous walking). By [CONTACT_49418] 3-[ADDRESS_672941] walking day at 40 minutes. Thus, by [CONTACT_5875] 5 up to 6 months, subjects are participating fully in the aerobic component of the program ([ADDRESS_672942] 3 days/week). However, it is likely that not all subjects in the aerobic group can progress at this rate. In these cases, the interventionist will tailor a program of increasing duration per session and increasing frequency per week to eventually achieve the complete walking program of 40 minutes.   Structure of aerobic exercise: minimum of 3 days per week (45 minutes each) walking, up to 5 days per week (30 minutes each).   If a subject has limited endurance and can only manage [ADDRESS_672943] session before complaining of fatigue or RPE of ‘very hard exertion,’ the following adapted schedule may be used such that the subject is participating fully by [CONTACT_10585] 6.  Health Education Arm:  Interventionists will have equivalent contact [CONTACT_518745]. They will visit weekly for the first four weeks, biweekly at weeks 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_672944] of a home-based behavioral intervention packet of reading materials and videos for lifestyle practices including nutrition, stress management and risk factors for negative health outcomes (e.g., smoking, etc).   At the Orientation Visit (Week 0), subjects will complete the Health Education Contract with the interventionist and select their preferred topic order. Participants will be given a binder for the reading materials. There will be approximately two topi[INVESTIGATOR_518737] 4-5 reflection questions per week via electronic journal or on paper, to measure adherence. Because providing ‘choices’ to the subjects has been shown to greatly impact adherence, the subjects will be given the choice to complete [ADDRESS_672945] 80% of the prescribed exercise sessions. Participants who miss one or more exercise sessions each week will be contact[CONTACT_518746] a study team member to provide encouragement and help generate a plan to help the participant complete the training sessions the following week. In cases where adherence is an ongoing problem, the study team may meet with the interventionist to discuss strategies to increase adherence (e.g., goal setting, reinforcers identified and scheduled, etc.). Theory and evidence-based approach to increase adherence. A challenge of employing a behavioral intervention is achieving program adherence and completion, particularly in 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_672946] with the participant by [CONTACT_518747]’s perspective on the intervention and any perceived barriers to increasing self-efficacy.41-[ADDRESS_672947] 2 weeks.  To encourage adherence and accountability, these steps will be followed: 1) The interventionist will develop a contract with the participant and identify motivating factors for compliance and increasing positive health outcomes during the first [ADDRESS_672948] copy will be kept in the behavioral modification packet for the participant. 2) The participant will complete an exercise journal of activity completion (start/stop time), heart rate during activity, and any adverse events. It has been highly successful for collecting confidential information for our current projects and will be used for the participants’ journal. 3) The interventionist will conduct weekly phone calls for the first [ADDRESS_672949] will complete monthly home visits to provide encouragement and retrieve pedometer data as well as the exercise journal. 4) The study coordinator will mail monthly newsletters to the participants on the health benefits of exercise (or healthy lifestyles for the control arm). 5) The interventionist will perform a fidelity check during [ADDRESS_672950] will perform the program with the participant (walking, strengthening activities) to observe the participant’s completion and use motivational techniques to provide feedback and additional instruction if needed. If the participant must travel away from the home during the intervention period of [ADDRESS_672951] will work with the participant to establish a plan for maintaining activity during travel time. 6) To mitigate possible reduced motivation over time, we will conduct 2 “refresher course” at the midway point of the intervention. The steps of using a contract and journal to increase adherence in MCI have been used by [CONTACT_6283].

The study investigators will answer any questions participants may have about the study. • Evaluation: Subjects will receive an in--person evaluation including a review of medical history, physical screen and a comprehensive neuropsychological screening battery assessing memory and attention. Subjects will be asked to provide a saliva sample. 30-Day Compliance Test • Physical Activity Monitoring: Subjects will be given an accelerometer and asked to wear the device at home for a period of 30 days. 6.1.1 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization Baseline Assessments (2-day Visit): The following procedures will take place over 2 days at the baseline visit. Total participation during the 2--day period is not anticipated to exceed 10 hours. (For example, baseline participation may be 6 hours on day one and 4 hours on day two). ● Cognitive Tasks: Subjects will be asked to perform one or more memory or attention task(s). They may be presented with images, videos, words, numbers, or sounds. The cognitive testing session should last no more than two hours. ● Questionnaires: Subjects will be asked to complete one or more surveys or questionnaires on paper or in electronic format. Completing these documents should take no more than 30 minutes. ● fMRI Scan: Subjects will be asked to perform cognitive tasks while we use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure changes in activity in the brain. Estimated time in the MRI machine will be about [ADDRESS_672952] no more than 3.5 hours including said cognitive tasks. ● PET/CT Scan: Subjects may be asked to participate in 2 positron emission tomography (PET/CT) scans per visit (2 at Baseline and 2 at 6-month visit). After a delay of about 75 minutes to allow the tracers to be absorbed, you will be moved into the PET/CT scanner for about 30 minutes. ● Blood Draw: Subjects will be asked to have a blood draw. This will be a fasting blood draw. We will collect about 50 mL of blood. ● Physical Assessment: Subjects will be asked to complete a physical function test. Subjects will be asked to perform a number of everyday activities. The second assessment is a treadmill walking test performed at the clinical exercise research center 
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   20 (CERC) while we monitor heart rate. Subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_3665]. Finally, body composition and body weight will be measured at the same time on the Biospace InBody 520 device. Subjects will stand on the scale-like device while graspi[INVESTIGATOR_518738], one in each hand. The device works by [CONTACT_5583] a very low- voltage electrical signal through the body to determine water content and body fat percentage. The voltage is so low that subjects cannot feel it. The testing will take about 45 minutes. ● Randomization: Subjects will be assigned randomly, much like tossing a coin, to a study group. They will be randomized into one of two health programs, and will have a 50% chance of being placed in either group. One group will participate in an at-home walking program and the other an at-home health education program.  6.1.2 Follow-up Visits / Completion/Final Evaluation Follow-up 6-month Visit (2-day Visit): The following procedures will take place over 2 days at the follow-up visit. Total participation during the 2-day period is not anticipated to exceed 10 hours.

Finally, body composition and body weight will be measured at the same time on the Biospace InBody 520 device. Subjects will stand on the scale-like device while graspi[INVESTIGATOR_518739] 3.0 April 26, 2024   21 two handles, one in each hand. The device works by [CONTACT_5583] a very low- voltage electrical signal through the body to determine water content and body fat percentage. The voltage is so low that subjects cannot feel it. The testing will take about 45 minutes. 7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  Adverse events are recorded via electronic recording directly into REDCap by [CONTACT_518748] “Have there been any changes in your health status?” Any reporting of an AE triggers an alert to the study team in the REDCap system. 7.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events   An adverse event (AE) is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Adverse events are to be recording regardless of their relationship to the study intervention.  A serious adverse event (SAE) is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly.  7.1.1  Evaluation of Safety Measures  Event and participant count of the following will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_518749]:  • AE: Overall and by [CONTACT_7204] • AE: MedDRA Preferred Term • SAE: Overall and by [CONTACT_7204] • SAE: MedDRA Preferred Term • SAE Definitely Related to Intervention: Overall and by [CONTACT_1196] • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Deaths  Comparisons of the number of participants with at least one AE, SAE, SAE definitely related to Intervention and Death will be examined between Intervention groups using the Fisher's Exact test.

If a participant expresses a desire to stop the intervention, the study team will meet to discuss the participant’s existing challenges and possible approaches to reduce burden to encourage continued participation if at all possible (e.g., adapt exercise routine to reduce pain or increase interest, problem-solve regarding adherence issues, etc.). If a participant continues to decline further participation, or if an investigator discontinues the intervention, an exit interview should be completed as soon as possible immediately following intervention discontinuation.  
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   23  All early intervention discontinuation participants will be strongly encouraged to complete the month 6 assessment visit.           Reasons for Early Discontinuation       Participants are allowed to voluntarily discontinue participation in this trial at any time. Due to the low safety risk of this intervention, we do not anticipate early discontinuation due to safety concerns.  9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  9.1 General Design Issues  Hypotheses regarding the primary cognitive outcome, and secondary and exploratory outcomes will be tested using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) including indicator variables for time, intervention, time-by-intervention interaction term, and additional covariates meeting confounding criteria below. A participant-level random intercept will be specified; significance of random slopes will be tested and included in the model if significant. Age and sex/gender will be treated as potential confounders. Potential confounders will be identified from randomization imbalance and based on their effect on the magnitude of treatment. A variable will be treated as confounder if adding it to the model changes the value of treatment estimate by [CONTACT_726] 15%. APOE4 will be included in all models because it was a randomization stratification factor. For fMRI hippocampal BOLD analysis, within subject changes in activity will be calculated for each individual subject in those with both baseline and follow-up fMRI data. Subject data will be normalized to group template space which is comprised of timepoint [ADDRESS_672956] observable for this analysis are described below:  This study was powered based on the fMRI primary outcome. Group sample sizes of 30 achieve 80% power for each test to detect an effect size of at least 0.[ADDRESS_672957]. There are 2 primary outcomes (cognition, imaging), but because they are very different measures, the alpha level will remain at 0.[ADDRESS_672958] significant differences in brain function.  9.2.1 Treatment Assignment Procedures    We used a randomized, single-blind study design where randomization was achieved using a permuted block schema with block sizes of 2 and 4. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either aerobic walking or healthy living education arms and stratified by [CONTACT_291292]4 carrier status (yes/no) based on saliva APOE phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Research suggests that APOE4 status may affect response to exercise, thus carriers were balanced across groups.     9.3 Interim analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_518740]. 9.4 Outcomes  Hypotheses regarding the primary cognitive outcome, and secondary and exploratory outcomes will be tested using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) including indicator variables for time, intervention, time-by-intervention interaction term, and additional covariates meeting confounding criteria below. A participant-level random intercept will be specified; significance of random slopes will be tested and included in the model if significant. Age and sex/gender will be treated as potential confounders. Potential confounders will be identified from randomization imbalance and based on their effect on the magnitude of treatment. A variable will be treated as confounder if adding it to the model changes the value of treatment estimate by [CONTACT_726] 15%. APOE4 will be included in all models because it was a randomization stratification factor.  For fMRI hippocampal BOLD analysis, within subject changes in activity will be calculated for each individual subject in those with both baseline and follow-up fMRI data. Subject data will be normalized to group template space which is comprised of timepoint [ADDRESS_672959] (MST) during the fMRI scan to provide both primary outcome measures of hippocampal BOLD signal and MST performance, which is assessed using the Lure Discrimination Index.   
 
 LEARNit Protocol Version 3.0 April 26, 2024   25 ● Hippocampal BOLD signal: change in hippocampal BOLD signal during the MST task defined as differences in activity between baseline and 6-month as the outcome measure. Change can be in either direction.  ● Lure Discrimination Index (LDI): change in the LDI score, defined as 6-month – baseline, as the outcome measure will be analyzed using the MMRM approach. Higher change scores indicate improvement in LDI performance.  9.4.2 Secondary outcomes   Secondary analyses will be conducted using the same MMRM statistical approach described above for the analysis of all secondary outcomes.  • Single-stage treadmill test: change in the VO2 max score from the single-stage treadmill test defined as 6-month – baseline as the outcome measure. Higher change scores indicate improvement. • Physical function test score: change in the Physical Function test score defined as 6- month – baseline as the outcome measure. Higher change scores indicate improvement. • Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level: change in total plasma BDNF defined as 6-month – baseline level as the outcome measure. Higher change scores are better. • Amyloid PET SUVR: change in global amyloid composite score including the mean of frontal, temporal, parietal cortex SUVRs defined as 6-months – baseline will be the outcome measure. Lower change scores are better. 9.5 Data Analyses Hypotheses regarding the primary cognitive outcome, and secondary and exploratory outcomes will be tested using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) including indicator variables for time, intervention, time-by-intervention interaction term, and additional covariates meeting confounding criteria below.

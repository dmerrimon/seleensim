 Hypothesis: Secretin enhances gastric accommodation and reduces post -nutrient challenge 
symptoms without altering gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia with normal baseline gastric emptying.  
 
Specific Aim s:  
1. To compare the effects of secretin vs. saline on satiation, fasting gastric volume, gastric 
accommodation and emptying, and symptoms  in patients with functional dyspepsia with 
normal gastric emptying.  
2. To compare the effects of secretin vs. saline on satiat ion, fasting gastric volume, gastric 
accommodation and emptying, and symptoms  in healthy human volunteers . 
3. To compare effects of secretin on satiation, fasting gastric volume, gastric 
accommodation and emptying, and symptoms  in patients with functional dys peps ia with 
normal gastric emptying and in healthy human volunteers   
 
Background 
  Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a very common cause of substantial morbidity, estimated to 
affect ten percent of the population, and manifest  as abdominal pain after eating, present at 
least three days per week. It has been estimated that [ADDRESS_1202244] in excess of 18 billion dollars in 2009 ( 1). Current medical treatment 
includes eradication of H pylori, acid suppression, prokinetic drugs, antidepressants, and 
psychological and alternative therapy, yet, despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831],  many patients remain refractory  to 
treatment , experiencing continued disabling symptoms ( 2).  
 
Insights into the pathophysiology of this disorder provide clues suggesting possible 
dysfunction of the gastrointestinal hor mone, secretin, and the possible therapeutic  use of a 
secretin agonist or positive allosteric modulator (PAM) in the management of this syndrome. A prominent pathophysiologic feature of FD is defective gastric accommodation, with inadequate 
relaxation of the fundus of the stomach in response to eating  responsible for the post -cibal pain. 
A key physiologic regulator of gastric accommodation is secretin. Additionally, the site of 
synthesis and secretion of this hormone is enteroendocrine S cells in the duodenum, a site 
recently described as being involved pathologically with inflammation and eosinophilia in FD ( 3). 
Secretin is believed to elicit gastric fundic  relaxation through its effects on secretin receptors on 
vagal afferent neurons, which go on to release VIP and prostaglandins ( 4, 5). While these 
events have been well documented in animal  models and healthy human subjects, there are no 
published data for the effectiveness of secretin in stimulating gastric accommodation in patients with FD.   
 
Secretin and its potential role in functional dyspepsia  
Insights into the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia, with recent demonstration of 
inflammation with eosinophilia and mastocytosis in the duodenum ( 3, 6, 7 ), providing a possible 
lead toward reduced secretion of a potential mediator of post -prandial gastric accommodati on, 
the gastrointestinal peptide hormone secretin. The dominant site of synthesis and secretion of 
this hormone are enteroendocrine S cells in the duodenum. Inflammation -induced damage to 
these cells could produce a deficiency. Since intraluminal acid is a prominent stimulant of S cell 
secretion, the attempts to treat functional dyspepsia with anti -secretory medications could 
actually exacerbate a secretin deficiency syndrome. This raises the possibility of the therapeutic 
use of a secretin agonist or a pos itive allosteric modulator of the secretin receptor for patients 
with functional dyspepsia.  
A prominent pathophysiologic feature of functional dyspepsia is defective gastric 
accommodation, with inadequate relaxation of the fundus of the stomach in response  to eating 
responsible for the postcibal pain. This was observed in 47% of 151 patients with functional dyspepsia in a Mayo Clinic study performed in the clinical practice of the PI ( 8). There are 
presently no generally effective medications to restore normal gastric accommodation, and there is only limited support, based on single- center studies, for the use of such diverse 
medications as clonidine, sumatriptan, and buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], many of which have central or vascular 
side effects, or acotiamide, a cholinesterase inhibitor approved for use in Japan, but not in the 
[LOCATION_003].  
  A key physiologic regulator of gastric accommodation is secretin. Secretin is believed 
to elicit gastric fundic relaxation through its effects on secretin receptors on vagal afferent 
neurons, which go on to release VIP and prostaglandins ( 4, 5). While these events have been 
well documented in animal models and healthy human subjects, there are no published data for the effectiveness of secretin in stimulating gastric accommodation in patients w ith functional 
dyspepsia.  
We postulate that therapy that increases levels and/or  effectiveness of secretin to relax 
the gastric fundus  in FD patients will increase gastric accommodation and reduce post -cibal 
abdominal pain and other symptoms . This can theoretically be accomplished with a secreti n 
agonist or a PAM  increasing the biological response to physiologically -released secretin. 
Therefore, it is important to establish whether secretin can induce gastric accommodation in FD, 
supporting use of exogenous  secretin, or, if the secretin response is blunted or absent, 
suggesting that  an allosteric modulator might be important to develop for this application.  
Currently, only natural secretin peptide is approved for clinical use, and is a safe and 
effective reagent that can only be administered parenterally for diagnostic purposes. No orally 
active secretin agonist or PAM has yet been reported.  
 
Study Design 
 We will utilize single photon emission computed tomography  (SPECT) methodology and 
gamma scintigraphy present in the GI laboratory of the outpatient Clinical Research Unit to 
study fasting gastric volumes and postprandial gastric accommodation responses and gastric 
emptying rates of a standardized meal  in patients with functional dyspepsia and healthy 
subjects . Both groups will be studied twice, using crossover design, once with administration of 
secretin and once with placebo. This will provide each subject  as his/her own control, as well as 
providing contrast in baseline and responsiveness to this hormone across the groups.  
Rationale for Crossover design and selection of FD patients  
The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia includes:  
a. Delayed gastric emptying 
b. Accelerated gastric emptying (sometimes associated with impaired gastric 
accommodation) 
c. Reduced postprandial gastric accommodation  
d. Hypersensitivity to  gastric mechanical distension  
e. Hypersensitivity to duodenal nutrients  
f. Duodenal inflammation 
g. Combinations of different mechanisms  
Given the interest in secretin, we shall select patients with FD and prior documentation of normal or accelerated gastric emptying and/or reduced gastric accommodation.  Given the 
diversity of mechanisms, the most efficient way to appraise the effects of secretin or PAM is 
through a crossover design.     
Eligibility Criteria  
Functional dyspepsia patients  (n=15) and healthy subjects (n=15 ) aged 18- 65 years will 
be recruited, and enrolled after providing written informed consent.  The goal is to obtain the 
completed crossover results from 10 healthy and 10 Functional dyspepsia patients. Once that 
criterion  is satisfied, enrollment will stop.  The FD group will be identified from Mayo Clinic 
patients living within a 50 mile radius (Olmsted and Goodhue counties) who have symptoms 
consistent with this diagnosis and who have been studied and found to have normal or 
accelerated gastric emptying. Subjects may be involved in study activity for up to six  weeks from 
screening date to completion of all studies. The actual study will be conducted on two separate  
days, each involving 3-4 hours of study . These testing visits should be scheduled one week 
apart, but within 4 weeks.  
Male and female subjects, aged 18 to 65 years at screening, who meet the following 
criteria, will be eligible for enrollment. A detailed history will be obtained with validated 
questionnaires [including Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298739] , Functional Dyspepsia

Preliminary Data  
We have conducted a search of Mayo Clinic database for patients with functional dyspepsia and 
identified 34 potential candidates for the study:  
Pharmacokinetics and Dosing of Secretin  
Synthetic natural human secretin  
Pharmacokinetics and Dosing of Secretin : The standard dose of secretin used in exocrine 
pancreatic function testing is 0.2 mcg/kg IV over [ADDRESS_1202246] responses at the exocrine pancreas for a much longer 
period of time (minutes to hours afterward).  
Dosing:  We will administer the secretin at 0.2 mcg/kg IV over 1 min, immediately before 
initiating the Ensure administration. The placebo will be similar infusion of normal saline.  
Participants will receive the i.v. secretin dose on 1 occasion and the i.v. placebo on 1 occasion . 
IND: Use of the medication will be as a proof of concept with pharmacodynamics measurements 
rather than with intention of developi[INVESTIGATOR_862380] a therapeutic. However, the medication is being provided by [CONTACT_500903], Inc. who has requested a new IND from the FDA: the study will 
be conducted under the new IND  number 141437 .   
Supply : Human Secretin for injection (16 mcg/10 ml vial) will be  provided (60 vials) by 
[CONTACT_500903], Inc , Burtonsville, MD and will be stored in and dispensed by [CONTACT_862387]. 
Secretin is available as a lyophilized sterile powder in [ADDRESS_1202247] will reconstitute with 8mL of saline for injection to yield a final 
concent ration of 2mcg of human secretin/mL.    
 
Randomization   
The randomization schedule will be generated before the start of the study in the Mayo 
Clinic Section of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, and will be given to the research 
pharmacist. Medications will be  stored  in a monitored, climate -controlled environment according 
to manufacturer’s directions. Monitoring records will be available for review to ensure quality 
control.  
 
Experimental Procedures  
Design: We propose to measure fasting gastric volumes, and postprandial gastric 
accommodation responses and gastric emptying rates of a standardized meal in  functional 
dyspepsia patients  and healthy subjects during two testing periods. Participants in each group 
will be randomly assigned to receive secretin or  placebo at the first sitting  and the opposite for 
the second sitting.  We will also measure acute food intake (meal size) in each participant, as 
the total volume ingested until they reach satiation, and postprandial symptoms. The plasma 
levels of several neuropeptides and hormones will be measured during fasting and postprandially to provide an initial understanding of the mechanism of action of secretin on gastric volume, accommodation and satiation indices.  
Gastric Accommodati on Measurements; Fasting and postprandial gastric volume 
(GV)  by [CONTACT_592218] (SPECT  [9]) developed and validated 
(including  performance characteristics)  
in our lab.  Using the ratio of postprandial volume over the fasting 
volume is a measure of the 
postprandial gastric accommodation. 
Radiation exposure listed in Appendix.  
Gastric Emptying 
To assess gastric emptying during the 
satiation test  (10), the firs t 300 mL of 
Ensure® will be radiolabeled with 50 
μCi of 111In-DTPA and 2- minute duration anterior and posterior scans of the abdomen will be 
obtained right after the Ensure is ingested and  then 15 minutes (which will be after the end of 
SPECT imaging ) at [ADDRESS_1202248] 300mL of 
Ensure®.  Radiation exposure listed in Appendix.  
 
Plasma Measurements  Blood draws (18 cc each) will be taken during fasting (in two 
occasions) and postprandially (at 15, 45 and 90 minutes after starting ingestion of Ensure) 
during the gastric function measurements. We will measure plasma levels of GIP,  pancreatic 
polypeptide, and glucagon- like peptide- 1 (GLP -1). A blood sample for possible future DNA 
testing will be collected also.  
GLP-1 will be measured as the biologically active GLP -1 (active and total) using a 2- site, non-
competitive immunoassay based on enzyme- labeled quantification of GLP -1 detected by a 
fluorogenic substrate. Total GIP will be measured using a two- site sandwich immu noassay 
using a total GIP ELISA kit (Millipore Corp, Billerica, MA, [LOCATION_003]); the antibody used specifically recognizes human GIP (1- 42) and GIP (3 -42), but not other forms of oxyntomodulin, GLP -1, or 
GLP-2.  Pancreatic polypeptide will be measured (at Mayo ICL) on the same plasma samples 
using radioimmunoassay  technique.  
 
Satiation ( 11) by [CONTACT_862388]® nutrient drink test with ingestion (1kcal/mL, 11% fat, 73% 
carbohydrate, and 16% protein) at a constant rate of 30ml/min to measure volume to fullness 
(VTF) , and MTV. This will start [ADDRESS_1202249] intake to when they reach 5 levels of 
fullness.  These levels of fullness are from 1) first sensation; 2) mild satiety; 3) moderate satiety; 
4) severe satiety and 5) maximum satiety.  Nutrient intake is stopped when subjects reach the maximum satiety . Time and total volume consumed to maximum satiety is calculated and the 
time and total volume is also calculated to moderate satiety Postprandial symptoms of fullness, 
nausea, bloating, and pain are measured 30 minutes after the meal using 100mm horizontal visual analog scales, with the words “none” and “worst ever” anchored at each end.  Before 
starting any gastric testing, we will assess the volunteer’s current symptoms using the 
Functional Dyspepsia Symptom Diary  and then again along with the postprandial symptoms 
questionnaire 30 minutes after the meal . Questionnaires used are in Appendix.  

Study Schedule 
 
Measurement/Outcomes 
Participants will undergo the following tests  on two separate occasions, each lasting 3- 4 hours : 
• Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to calculate fasting 
gastric volume and postprandial gastric accommodation  
• Gastric emp tying (by [CONTACT_298754]) of Ensure after 30 minutes  
• Measurement of volume to fullness (mL), maximum tolerated volume (MTV), postprandial symptoms on satiation (nutrient drink)  test  
Pharmacodynamic Endpoints  
Comparison of the effects of secretin vs. placebo (saline) on the following 
gastrointestinal functions in FD patients  and healthy subjects :  
• Difference in fasting gastric volume  
• Difference in gastric volume after the 300 mL Ensure meal for secretin vs. placebo  
• Difference in gastric emptying of radiolabeled Ensure after 30 minutes  
• Volume to fullness (sensation of usual postprandial fullness) and maximum 
tolerated volume (MTV).  
• Difference in postprandial symptoms 30 minutes after ingesting maximum 
tolerated volume of Ensure 
Sample Size Determination  
 Sample size assessment  for primary aim to examine the within  dyspepsia patient 
response when receiving Secretin versus Placebo.  Sample size is based on the results of 
primary endpoints in the Mayo Clinic lab [data show mean ± SD). Within [ADDRESS_1202250] (80% power, α=0.05 ) in this crossover trial demonstrable  
differences for secretin compared to placebo is 21%  in fasting gastric volume, 13.0% in 

postprandial gastric volume and 16.6% in amount of gastric retention of Ensure at [ADDRESS_1202251] size detectable 
(absolute [% of mean],  n=[ADDRESS_1202252] prandial gastric volume, mL  273

Peak postprandial GLP -1, pmol/L  18.8 14 13.94pmol/L ( 74.1%) 
Therefore the study is powered to detect clinically relevant effects of the study medication.  
A similar analysis will be conducted in the healthy human volunteers based on the cross -over 
design, and the anticipated effect sizes that would be demonstrable in this second group is 
similar to that s ummarized above for patients with functional dyspepsia.  
A subsidiary  (secondary)  analysis will compare the response using secretin in FD and healthy 
volunteers.  This will be a 2 sample, unpaired analysis of the observations on secretin 
treatment , with ten patients in each cohort . 
The table below shows the effects sizes demonstrable for the comparison between FD and 
health, using a 2 -group analysis (unpaired analysis), again a two- sided test at α=0.05, with 80% 
power.

Statistical Methods  
It is anticipated that all primary and secondary endpoints will be norm ally distributed. We 
will use parametric tests to assess study parameters.    If the data are not normally distributed 
we will use non- parametric tests.    
For the primary aim, comparison of responses in the [ADDRESS_1202254] drug 
levels of secretin.   It is unclear if these covariate analyses will be required given the small 
sample sizes (n=10  in each group)    
Safety Considerations  
Informed consent  
A complete description of the study will be presented to each potential study participant and signed and dated informed consent will be obtained before any study specific procedures are 
performed.  
Demographics and medical history  
A medical history and review of body systems along with demographic data will be obtained for 
all patients during the screening period (Days -30 to - 1). Data that will be recorded in the source 
document/CRF include gender, race, date of birth, cigarette smoking history, alcohol use, drug 
abuse history and concomitant medication use.  
Physical examination 
A physical examination will be performed during the screening period to confirm eligibility.  
Concomitant medication review  
A review of concomitant medications will be conducted during the screening period and at every study visit. Any medications taken by [CONTACT_862389] a Concomitant Medication CRF.  
Vital signs and wei ght 
Vital signs will be obtained in the sitting position. Body temperature (°C), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] 
(breaths/minute) and weight will be recorded at each time point when vital signs are measured. 
Height (cm) will be measured at the screening visit.  
Pregnancy testing  
Urine pregnancy testing will be done for women of childbearing potential at screening. Urine 
pregnancy testing will be done on day 1 prior to randomization to study drug and placebo and at the final study visit or earlier if the patient is disconti nued.  
A woman of childbearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or 
bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal [defined as amenorrhea >12 consecutive 
months; or women with documented plasma follicle- stimulating hormone level >35lU/mL].  
Women who are using oral, implanted or injectable contraceptive hormones, an intrauterine 
device, barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicidal) to prevent pregnancy, practicing 
abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) will be considered to be of childbearing 
potential.  
Adverse Events : 
Adverse Event Grading will be in accordance with the severity grading scheme of the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;

Amendment #1: 15Jul [ADDRESS_930755]™ RX-ARAS -001 1.0 BACKGROUND  
 
Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis 
(RAS) in the adult population .(1) ARAS may result in progressive renal impairment, renovascular 
hypertension, and/or cardiac disturbance syndromes. As the disease progresses, the result ing 
luminal narrowing decreases blood flow to the kidney, which, in turn, is often accompanied by a 
reduction in kidney function as well as hypertension triggered by [CONTACT_686636] -
angiotensin axis. If left untreated, ARAS may progress to renal fa ilure.(2) 
 
The identification and management of patients with suboptimal control of hypertension and 
coexistent atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is both challenging and controversial .(3, 4) Current 
ACC/AHA Peripheral Arterial Disease Guidelines identify renal artery stent deployment as a 
revascularization strategy in patients with hypertension resistant to optimal medical 
management .(5) However, a contemporary literature review suggested that there is no data 
supporting a revascularization strategy over optimal antihypertensive medical therapy .(6) Indeed, 
several single -arm prosp ective trials sponsored by [CONTACT_686637], while 
establishing the procedural safety of renal artery stent deployment after failed/suboptimal 
balloon angioplasty, were unable to demonstrate a predictable and durable reduction in blood 
press ure.(7, 8) 
 
More than 50% of subjects with uncontrolled hypertension unresponsive to traditional medical 
therapy  may have significant ARAS and are considered candidat es for surgical revascularization 
or percutaneous intervention for the resolution or stabilization of hypertension and renal 
dysfunction. Surgical revascularization has proven to be an effective treatment with acceptable 
long-term patency rates but is hamp ered by [CONTACT_686638].(2) Percutaneous 
transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) has been successful in reducing morbidity and mortality 
compared to surgical revascularization but has poor technical success du e to high rates of elastic 
recoil and dissection for typi[INVESTIGATOR_686612], as well as high restenosis rates.  Primary stenting 
of atherosclerotic ostial lesions in the renal artery has thus become the preferred method of 
treatment due to higher success r ates compared to surgical revascularization .(2) 
 
To date, there have been no pi[INVESTIGATOR_686613] , for newer 
generation stents in patients with resistant hypertension as sociated with ARAS . Previously 
published industry -sponsored trials have not focused on improvement of hypertension control as 
a primary endpoint .(9) The Cardiovascular Outcomes of Renal Artery Lesions (CORAL) tr ial(10), 
a National Institutes of Health  (NIH) sponsored, prospective randomized controlled trial of 
optimal medical therapy compared to optimal medical therapy and renal artery stent deployment, 
will define t he potential impact of renal artery stenting on rates of cardiovascular related  
morbidity  and mortality , progression to renal replacement therapy and blood pressure control 
over five years of follow -up. However, the final analysis of this 1,050 cohort tria l is not 
anticipated until after 201 1. In the interim, clinical trials designed to establish the safety of new

Amendment #1: 15Jul [ADDRESS_930756]™ RX-ARAS -001 renal stent designs and their effectiveness in improving blood pressure control are needed. In 
order to facilitate the initiation and completion of single -armed prospective trials investigating 
the safety and effectiveness of balloon -expandable stents to treat hypertensive patients with 
ARAS , physicians (VIVA) have used modern clinically relevant data and statistical modeling to 
develop blood press ure and procedural safety performance goals to be used as a comparator in 
some single -armed prospective trials .(2) 
 
Although a trend toward a favorable restenosis rate has been noted with the use of stents,  
as compared with the with balloon angioplasty alone ,(11, 6) restenosis remains the  main concern 
after PTRA  stenting . Restenosis often results in symptom recurrence and may  progress to 
occlusion and kidney loss.  Thus, e arly restenosis detection is important to allow  for effective 
secondary intervention ; DUS is emerging as a screening modality for RAS .(12,13, 14) Although the 
value of DUS in RAS screening is well established, its role in  assessing the hemodynamic 
outcome of percutaneous intervention and routine follow -up after successful intervention has not 
been well evaluated .(15) 
 
A number of recognized conditions can limit the accuracy of intrarenal DUS in R AS evaluation, 
such as multiple (more than two) renal arteries or only mild to m oderate stenosis .(13) Patients who 
are young or have highly  compliant arteries may have an absent  early systol ic peak, especially 
when distal interlo bar arteries are sampled, which may yield false -positive results .(16) Conversely,  
noncompliant vess els may not display the parvus -tardus response and  may result in fa lse-
negative results .(17) Several ext raneous factors may also affect the accuracy of intrarenal DUS 
including valvular heart disease, left ventricular contracti lity disorders, and the effect of 
vasoactive drug s.(15) 
 
Clinical follow -up, which  has traditionally been used in large series  of percutaneous and surgical 
renal artery  revascularizations, may not enable detection  of asymptomat ic restenosis before it  
becomes symptomatic or progresses to  kidney loss. Magnetic resonance angiography  (MRa)  
after stent placement is limited by  [CONTACT_686639] .(18) DUS as a 
follow -up modali ty offers  several advantages: being widely available, non -invasive, relatively 
inexpensive, and well tolerated by [CONTACT_686640] . DUS 
in the evaluation of initial patency an d subsequent surveillance after renal art ery 
revascularization has been recommended .(19, 20, 21)  
 
Renal artery angioplasty and stent placement are generally well -tolerated procedures. As 
comp ared to stand -alone balloon angioplasty, renal artery stenting is associated with improved 
immediate results and a decrease in the rate of restenosis.(22) Complications include contrast -
induced nephropathy, th rombosis, distal embolization, renal artery dissection , and perforation.(17) 
Distal protection devices are attractive for safeguarding against the effects of distal embolization 
and are currently under investigation .(6) However, the short length of renal arteries and lack of a 
safe landing zone for placement of distal protection devices is a limiting factor. An alternative

Amendment #1: 15Jul [ADDRESS_930757]™ RX-ARAS -001 strategy could be the use of covered stents.  
 
The use of polyt etraflouroethylene  (PTFE ) covered stents is designed to combine the 
effectiveness of surgical treatment with the minimal invasiveness of endovascular treatment .(23) 
The stent -associated PTFE derived graft layer creates a mechan ical barrier between the arterial 
lumen and wall, theoretically improving patency .(24) This method prevents exposure of the vessel 
wall to constituents of blood that may initiate the intimal hyperplastic process which may reduc e 
the incidence of in -stent restenosis .(24) Lakshminarayan et al suggests that because covered stents 
could potentially exclude thrombus from within the lumen of lesions with large thrombus 
burden, there may be a role for these  stents in reducing distal embolization.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_930758] ™ RX Stent System consists of a balloon -expandable covered stent and a balloon 
dilation catheter. The stent is constructed out of 316L surgical stainless steel. The one pi[INVESTIGATOR_686614] a tubular form of expanded polytetraflouroethylene  (ePTFE).  The 
covering is attached in a manner such that both the inner lumen and outer surface of the stent are 
encapsulated with the ePTFE cover material. The stent is radio -opaque under fluoroscopy. The 
covered stent is mounted and crimped on to the dual lumen rapid exchange balloon catheter 
(delivery system) so that the system is ready for use by [CONTACT_15370].   
 
The balloon catheter shaft is comprised of two main sections: a distal coaxial section comprised 
of a thermoplastic inner tube and thermoplastic outer tube and a proximal section comprised of a 
[ADDRESS_930759] of the coaxial catheter section. Radiopaque markers are affixed to the inner tube of 
the distal catheter section to identify the dilatation zone of the balloon. The dista l catheter  tip is  
tapered to facilitate advancement of the catheter to and through the stenosis. The proximal hypo 
tube assembly section of the catheter is comprised of a stainless steel hypo  tube with an 
overmolded locking female  Luer hub attached to one end to allow attachment of a male locking 
Luer fitting (syringe/inflation device) . The attached female Luer hub is molded out of clear 
plastic to assist the user with purging the device of air during preparation. A strain relief is 
affixed over the Luer hu b and is printed with the device information (stent length, deployed stent 
diameter, guide wire size, and company logo).   
 
The catheter main lumen (annular space between the inner and outer coaxial tubes and lumen of 
hypo tube assembly) is used for inflati on and deflation of the attached balloon . The secondary 
lumen  (lumen of the inner tube of coaxial assembly) , is referred to as the Rapid Exchange ( RX) 
lumen  and is used for guide wire introduction. The inner and outer tubes are joined 
approximately 25cm fr om the distal tip to form the guide wire access port . The catheter will be 
available in two working lengths: 80cm and 140cm . Balloons will be available in diameters of 5, 
6, and 7mm and in lengths to accommodate the length of each stent. Table 1: iCAST ™ RX Stent

studies  has demonstrated that the number of lesions treated per patient has increased with 
time.(26) A recent  renal  trial report ed 1.2 lesions per patient  were treated .(27) To calculate on a per 
patient level for this endpoint would bias the results  and overestimate the failure rate  compared 
to a per lesion analysis,  as more lesions would be at risk for restenosis but would not be 
accounted for i n a per patie nt analysis . 
 
DUS  is an established safe, noninvasive, reproducible, and sensitive method of detecting and 
following renal artery lesions that provides both morphological and functional assessments of the 
renal arteries .(22, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32) There are limits  with relying exclusively on DUS for evaluating 
residual stenosis post -renal stenting. Velocity information such as peak systolic velocity ( PSV) 
and renal aortic ratio ( RAR ) correlate with angiographic stenosis but these DUS criteria , 
developed for native renal arteries within renal artery stents has not been studied extensively .(25) 
The extremes of ARAS can lead to a variety of waveform and flow velocity abnormalities and 
the entire main renal art ery must be visualized in order to perform an adequate examination .(24) 
There are documented technical disadvantages to DUS as it is very operator dependent and as 
such, is associated with higher technical fai lure rate than other diagnostic modalities, in part due 
to the steep learning curve associated with the technique. To mitigate the challenges with DUS 
interpretation, clinical validation through independent noninvasive core laboratory  and/or 
angiography wi ll be require d in order to correctly validate and definitively assess residual 
percent diameter stenosis.  DUS is highly reliable in identifying widely paten t stents. However, 
correlation studies of DUS with angiography have confirmed that DUS is not as acc urate when 
results suggest a stenosis. To mitigate the risk of inaccurate readings, if a stenosis is detected, an 
alternate means of clinical validation will be used to definitively assess patency.  
 
The primary clinical endpoint of reduction in SBP has bee n established to determine the benefit 
of revascularization therapy to perfuse the kidney.  The Framingham Heart Study showed that 
decreasing SBP by 10mmHg can be lifesaving. Additionally,  Joint National Committee VII (JNC 
VII) estimates that a 5mmHg reduc tion in SBP would reduce the incidence of stroke in patients 
by 14%, coronary heart disease ( CHD ) by 9%, and overall mortality by 7% .(33) JNC VII also 
presented data from a [LOCATION_006] diabetes study that demonstrated a 10mmHg decrease in SBP was 
associated with average reductions of 15% for diabetes -related mortality, 11% for MI, and 13% 
for microvascular complications of retinopathy or nephropathy.(33) Currently accepted indications 
for revascularization are significant ARAS with progressive or acute deterioration of renal 
function and/or severe uncontrolled hypertension; the key point for success is the correct 
selection of the patient .(34) When performed correctly, renal artery stenting had been shown to 
stabilize o r improve renal function and/or renovascular hypertension in 65 -70% of carefully 
selected patients with ARAS .(1) It is under this guidance that patients with  uncontrolled 
hypertension will be selected by [CONTACT_686641].

Amendment #1: 15Jul [ADDRESS_930767]™ RX-ARAS -[ADDRESS_930768] that some patients do 
show a stabilization or improvement in their hypertension following  revascularization. Clinical 
data show that successful renal artery stenting permits reintroduction of ACE inhibitors in some 
patients which in turn leads to satisfactory maintenance of renal function.(35) Current clinical  
experience does not allow one to predict exactly which patients may experience a clinical benefit 
from renal artery stenting . It is hypothesized that revascularization therapy for hemodynamically 
significant lesions may facilitate the stabili zation or reduction of blood pressure in conjunction 
with ongoing medical therapy for some portion of patients whose blood pressure is otherwise 
refractory to medical treatment.  
 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria in the ARTISAN trial seeks to target subject s likely to respond 
positively based on findings observed in the VIVA performance goals for blood pressure 
treatment.  In the VIVA paper, p atients are selected specifically for blood pressure improvement 
based on the review of three prior studies that sugg est patients with resistant hypertension  with a 
systolic blood pressure > 155mmHg, have been medically optimized with 3 or more hypertensive 
medications, and a lesion that is hemodynamically significant (or gradient) will have a likelihood 
of having a bloo d pressure improvement beyond medical therapy alone .(36) 
 
The ARTISAN  trial will assess  the impact of  additional clinical outcomes in this patient 
population such as improvements in systolic blood pressure and  renal function as determined by 
[CONTACT_67889]. Additionally, MAEs, the number and dose of antihypertensive medications used, 
technical success, acute procedural success, [ADDRESS_930769] the primary and secondary endpoints as 
applicable measures of device effectiveness and safet y.(37) 
 
Renal artery stent placement has gained increasing acceptance on the basis  of historical results of 
renal angioplasty and the attractiveness of percutaneous compared with surgical 
revascularization.(38) As a result, primary stenting of lesions has become the standard of care.  In 
this study, primary stenting of the target lesion  will be performed  where possible . The enrollment 
criterion  of the ARTISAN  trial has selected patients with hemodynamically significant stenoses 
and where necessary, pre-dilatation will be performed due to  narrowing of the  lumen diameter of 
the stenosis compared to the size of the device being inserted.  This strategy is selected to 
minimize the risk of distal embolization  and stent dislodgment during deployment . 
 
In conclusion, the safety , effectiveness , and c linical benefit of reducing blood pressure with the 
iCAST™ RX Stent System will be evaluated under the ARTISAN trial design .

A trial research staff member will explain the purpose, procedures, device , and int ent of the trial 
to each potential participant. Interested subjects will be invited to join the trial and asked to 
provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any trial related procedure.  
 
A focused hypertension medical history will be reviewe d and recorded for each subject. History 
should capture at least three months’ information prior to screening to document that reasonable 
and aggressive efforts were previously made to manage hypertension via a broad variety of 
medications that have been t ried and failed. Potential subjects will have been on a stable 
medication regimen for a minimum of two weeks prior to beginning the Medical Documentation 
Screening period. A minimum of a 14-day Medical Documentation Screening period is required 
to refine c ase selection and identify subject s most likely to benefit from renal revascularization *. 
Titration of the subject ’s antihypertensive medications will not be allowed during this period.

1. Potential subjects will complete an initial office visit d uring which 3 blood pressure 
measurements will be obtained, utilizing a standardized technique  (APPENDIX 3: 
METHODOLOGY FOR OFFICE -BASED B P MEASUREMENT ), to determine an 
average  SBP value.  If the average initial SBP value  for this visit  is ≥ [ADDRESS_930790] labs drawn , can be scheduled for the

procedu re. Only subjects  with a n average SBP value ≥  150mmHg at this visit after 3 
sequential blood pressure measurements are taken, u tilizing  a standardized technique   
(APPENDIX 3: METHODOLOGY FOR OFFICE -BASED B P MEASUREMENT ), will 
be allowed to proceed.  
 A minimum of two office visits are required within the [ADDRESS_930793] visit, subjects should return every two weeks (+/ - 3days) for 
BP assessment and monitoring  and the daily questionnaire for medication 
compliance should be continued until the day of procedure . 
 
4. On the day of the scheduled procedure,  or no more than 14 days prior, 3 sequential blood 
pressure measurements will be taken  again , utilizing a standardized technique  
(APPENDIX 3: METHODOLOGY FOR OFFICE -BASED B P MEASUREMENT ), to 
determine a n average SBP value.  Only subjects with a n average SBP of ≥  155mmHg 
from the three measurements taken on the last day of the 14 -day Medical Documentation 
Screening period will be considered for enrollment.  
 
*NOTE: If a subject is seen in the clinic  with a medical history documenting  at least a 1 month 
stable medication of ≥  three  anti-hypertensive medication s from at least three classes of drugs,  
one of which being a diuretic and documented SBP  ≥ 155mmHg , they will be allowed t o skip the 
formal Medical Documentation Screening period and to be enrolled as so on as the history and 
baseline labs are  reviewed by [CONTACT_686645]. Subjects must complete the daily 
questionnaire from the day of consent through the day of procedure.  All other protocol 
requirements that would have normally occurred during the two w eek screening period must still 
be completed even if the screening period is skipped. These assessments includ e: vitals, BP ,

Amendment #1: 15Jul [ADDRESS_930820]™ RX-ARAS -001 5.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
5.1 ASSUMPTION OF PRIMAR Y ENDPOINT RATE  
The endpoints will be tested in a sequential manner:  
 
1) Functional Endpoint  
Assessment of  primary patency rate  at 9-months , defined as continuous patency without 
the occurrence of a total occlusion of the original lesion, without a re-intervention to treat 
a partial or total occlusion of the stented  segment, or by[CONTACT_686648] e to 
clinically -driven restenosis or occlusion.  
 
Followed by:  
 
2) Clinical  Endpoint  
Improvement in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 9-months as compared to baseline 
systolic blood pressure.  
 
If the null hypothesis for the functional goal is rejected at the 0. [ADDRESS_930821] (primary patency) null 
hypothesis can be rejected, succ ess will be declared only for that Performance Goal .  This 
sequential approach controls the overall significance level at 0.0 25.  Of note, no success can be 
declared if the null hypothesis for the primary patency goal was not rejected, regardless of the  
outcome for the other Performance Goal . 
 
For the primary patency endpoint, the proportion of subjects experiencing this outcome will be 
compared to the predefined Performance Goal  of 0.70. Formally, the hypothesis to be tested is:  
 
H0:  The incidence p PP of primary patency at 9-months is less than or equal to 0.70.  
 
Ho:   pPP ≤  0.70  
 
HA:          The incidence p PP of primary patency at 9-months is greater than 0.70.  
 
HA:  p PP  > 0. 70  
 
 
The derivation of the Performance G oal is described in Section 5.2.1 Derivation of the 
Performance Goal for Patency.

Amendment #1: 15Jul [ADDRESS_930822]™ RX-ARAS -001 For the SBP endpoin t, the change between  SBP from baseline to 9 -month follow -up will be 
compared to a predefined Performance Goal  of 10mmHg. Formally, the hypothesis to be tested 
is: 
 
H0:  The mean difference between  SBP at 9-months  and baseline , μ∆SBP, is less than or equal  
to 10mmHg.  
Ho:   μ∆SBP   ≤  10mmHg  
 
HA:  The mean difference between  SBP at 9 -months  and baseline , μ∆SBP, is greater than 
10mmHg . 
 
Ho:   μ∆SBP   > 10mmHg  
 
Both primary endpoints will be tested in one -sided fashion against a significance level of 0.0 25; 
the primary patency endpoint will be tested using exact binomial methods and the SBP endpoint 
will be tested using a paired  t-test. 
 
5.2 SAMPLE SIZE  
For a one -sided alpha of 0.0 25 and desired power of 87%, sample size for the primary patency 
endpoint is establishe d by [CONTACT_7702] a hypothesized primary patency incidence of 0.82, which 
gives 125 evaluable subjects  therefore,  accounting for 10% attrition, 138 subjects are needed for 
this endpoint. At the proposed evaluable sample size of 125, no more than 27 subjects ( 22%) can 
fail primary patency in order to meet the endpoint hypothesis . 
 
For the endpoint of reduction in SBP, we assume an average reduction of 13.7mmHg .  Under a 
hypothesized standard deviation of 12mmHg  for a difference in SBP there will be 92% power to 
meet the Performance G oal. This standard deviation is conservatively approximated based on the 
expected range of SBP at baseline of 155mmHg to 180mmHg divided by [ADDRESS_930823] the null hypothesis at a one -sided alpha of 0.0 25 at 
the proposed sample size.  
 
The primary endpoints of primary patency and reduction in SBP are powered at 87% and 92%, 
respectively, in order to m aintain the overall trial power at 80% to meet both endpoints . 
 
5.2.1 DERIVATION OF THE PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR PATENCY  
The Performance Goal was derived from a thorough literature  review of trials with renal 
bare metal stent  placement. Trials were identified by [CONTACT_572939] a PUBMED search of the 
English -language medical literature from 1991 to 2010.  When available, the following 
data were extracted: author and year of publication , number of  subjects , number  of

sign (including any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the investigational intervention, whether or not considered related  to 
the investigational intervention. Pre -existing conditions, which worsen during a trial, are to be 
considered AEs.

outcomes:  
 Death 
 Is life -threatening  
 Subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 A persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Important medical event s that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death

The Clinical Events Committee (CEC) is made up of physicians  with specialization in the field 
of this trial who are not participants in the trial.  The CEC is charged with the de velopment of 
specific criteria used for adjudication of clinical events related to the primary endpoints in the 
trial. 
 
At the onset of the trial, the CEC will develop a CEC Charter which will describe explicit rules 
outlining the minimum amount of data re quired, and the algorithm followed in order to classify a 
trial endpoint related clinical event.  The CEC will meet regularly (at a minimum of once per 
year) to review and adjudicate trial endpoint related clinical events in which the required 
minimum data  is not available. The CEC will also review and rule on all deaths that occur 
throughout the trial.  
 
Once the specific criteria for clinical events and endpoints are established, the CEC will be 
responsible for adjudicating all clinical events when all nec essary data are available.

diameters.  
 
There are risks for participa nts in this trial. Potential risks have been minimized by [CONTACT_686659]/exclusion criteria to ensure appropriate subjects participate in the trial.  
Additionally, all enrolling investigators will be instructed on appropriate patient selecti on, in an 
effort to minimize the risk of recruiting patients who are found to be ineligible for trial 
participation.    
 
To minimize the risk of the invasive assessment and the stent procedure, investigators will 
perform angiography and stent placement bas ed on:  current medical license, privileges to 
perform these services at their treatment center, board certification, or equivalent experience.  
Appropriate angiographic technique principles will be utilized to expose subjects to the least 
amount of contra st dye and radiation while providing high resolution angiograms.

ADVERSE EVENT  Any untoward medical occurrence observed in a 
patient or a clinical investigational subject. This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship 
between the AE and the device under investigation. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavo rable and 
unintended sign (including any clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the investigational 
intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational intervention. Pre -existi ng conditions, 
which worsen during a trial, are to be considered 
AEs.   
 
DE NOVO LESION  A lesion in a native vessel that has not been 
previously treated.  
 
DISSECTION  Renal artery dissections are stenotic or occlusive 
lesions most often observed in hypert ensive patients 
with underlying atherosclerosis or fibromuscular 
disease. Acute dissections may present 
spontaneously, as a complication of diagnostic or 
therapeutic angiography or as an agonal event 
associated with overwhelming systemic illness. 
Chronic d issections may produce renovascular 
hypertension or be entirely asymptomatic.  
 
 
DISTAL EMBOLIZATION  
 Free flowing blood clot or thrombus material located 
in the circulation distal to the treated occlusion.  
 
DUAL ANTI -PLATELET 
THERAPY  The use of thienopy ridine s in combination with 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_119457] . 
 
EMBOLI  Something that blocks the flow of blood in a vessel. 
It may be a gas bubble, a blood clot, a fat globule, a 
mass of bacteria, or other foreign body that usually

ASSOCIATION CLASSIFICATION  Class I:  The subject  has cardiac disease but without 
resulting limitations of ordinary physical activity. 
Ordinary physical activity (i.e ., walking several 
blocks or climbing stairs) does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. 
Limiting symptoms may occur with marked 
exertion.  
 
Class II:  The subject  has cardiac disease resulting in 
slight limitation of ordinary phys ical activity. 
Subject  is comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical 
activity such as walking more than two blocks or 
climbing more than one flight of stairs results in 
limiting symptoms (i.e., fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], 
dyspnea, or anginal pain).  
 
Class III : The subject  has cardiac disease resulting in 
marked limitation of physical activity. Subject  is 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical 
activity such as walking one of two blocks or 
climbing one flight of stairs  causes fatigue, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or  anginal pain.  
 
Class IV : The subject  has dyspnea at rest that 
increases with any physical activity. Subject  has 
cardiac disease resulting in inability to perform any 
physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of 
cardiac insufficiency or anginal syndro me may be 
present even at rest. If any physical activity is 
undertaken, discomfort is increased.

Amendment #1: 15Jul [ADDRESS_930871]™ RX-ARAS -001 APPENDIX 3: METHODOLOGY FOR OFFICE -BASED B P 
MEASUREMENT  
 
The following techniques for blood pressure determination have been proposed by [CONTACT_686666].(37, 53) 
 
Blood pressure must be measured with certified, calibrated, and validated equipment.  The size 
of the bladder within the blood  pressure cuff must encircle at least 80% of the arm.  Subject s 
should be seated in a chair with their backs supported and their arms bared and supported at heart 
level with feet flat on the ground.  Subject s should refrain from exercise, smoking or caffei ne 
ingestion for [ADDRESS_930872] (seated comfortably as above). Subject s should also have emptied 
their bladder prior to obtaining the measurement as a full bladder  can affect the reading.  
 
 If necessary, blood pressure may be measured in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_322944].  
However, the subject  should then be in the same position for subsequent 
measurements.  
 
 Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be record ed, with the first 
appearance of sound used to define systolic blood pressure and the disappearance of 
sound used to define diastolic blood pressure.  
 
 A minimum of three (3) readings separated by [ADDRESS_930873] 3 readings diffe r by >  5mmHg, additional readings should be obtained and 
averaged. Blood pressure should be measured in both arms, and the higher value 
obtained should be used.  
 
 Initial blood pressure should be measured in both arms, to identify which has the 
higher read ing.  From that point on, the arm with the higher reading becomes the “BP 
arm” for the remainder of the trial. For consistency, the site of blood pressure 
measurement should be recorded, and follow -up pressures should be maintained from 
the same arm.  The appropriately sized blood pressure cuff must again be used, and 
the site used must be well documented for future examinations.

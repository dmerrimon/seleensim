ABSTRACT  
This is a Phase 1 study of ramucirumab (IMC -1121B; LY3009806), a recombinant, human monoclonal 
antibody of the immunoglobulin G subclass 1 developed agains t the vascular endothelial growth factor- 2 
receptor (VEGFR -2), to be conducted in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors including CNS 
tumors. Ramucirumab specifically binds to the extracellular domain of human VEGFR -2 with high 
affinity and le ads to a comprehensive inhibition of the signaling pathways activated by [CONTACT_12270] -A (VEGF) 
binding. In addition to VEGF, Ramucirumab also inhibits the binding of VEGF -C and VEGF -D to 
VEGFR -2. By [CONTACT_531896] -2, ramucirumab has less potential to induce “off -
target” toxicities seen with VEGFR -[ADDRESS_690473] shown that 
ramucirumab is efficacious as either  a single agent or in combination with doxorubicin across a series of 
pediatric patient -derived xenograft sarcoma models including synovial, osteosarcoma, Ewing s, and 
undifferentiated histologies  and in a cell -derived neuroblastoma xenograft. It has undergone Phase  1, 2, 
and 3 testing in adults and ha s been  FDA approved for advanced gastro- esophageal carcinoma and 
metastatic non -small cell lung cancer . The adult recommended FDA approved doses are 8 mg/kg I.V. 
administered every other week  in gastric indications and 10 mg/kg I.V. administered every 3 weeks in 
non-small cell lung cancer . In Part  A, we will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D 
of ramucirumab given intravenously every other week in children with solid tumors, excluding  CNS 
tumors. In Part  B of the study we wil l evaluate the toler ability and /or RP2D of ramucirumab in children 
with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors. In addition to pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity studies, 
correlative biologic endpoints will include evaluation of angiogenic proteins and circulating 
hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Angiogenesis, the generation of new blood vessels from existing ones, is an essential 
physiological process that is deregulated in various pathological conditions including 
cancer.
[ADDRESS_690474] decade.3  
 The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor (VEGFR -2) pathway (VEGF pathway hereafter) is considered the most 
important mediator of tumor angiogenesis.
[ADDRESS_690475] majority of human tumors including

Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_690476]. While clinical benefit has not been universally demonstrated acros s several tumor types, the positive findings of prolonged overall 
survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in the prospective, randomized, 
double- blind phase III VELOUR study (aflibercept versus placebo in combination with 
irinotecan and 5 -FU [FOL FIRI] in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer [mCRC] after failure of an oxaliplatin based regimen) led to the recent US approval of the aflibercept -FOLFIRI combination  for use  in this patient population.
14 
However, the toxicity profile demonstrated that more patients on the aflibercept arm had 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events (83.5% vs. 62.5%). These events included not just those 
expected with anti -VEGF agents, such as hypertension, hemorrhage, and arterial and 
venous thromboembolic events, but also the potentiation of adverse effects associated 
with FOLFIRI.  
 Anot her therapeutic modality to inhibit angiogenesis involves targeting the VEGF 
pathway by [CONTACT_531897] (TKIs) to block the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity triggered by [CONTACT_12270]/VEGFR -2 binding . TKIs impede the downstream 
signals necessary for endothelial proliferation, survival, and migration that are required 
for tumor growth and metastasis; however, lack of absolute specificity of TKIs for 
VEGFR -2 results in significant “off -target” inhibition. For example, although the specific 
patte rn of kinase inhibition varies, the TKIs sorafenib,  sunitnib, cediranib, pazopanib, 
and motesanib all additionally inhibit VEGFR s [ADDRESS_690477] mechanism of action.   To this end, selective inhibition of the extracellular domain of VEGFR -2 has been explored.  Ramucirumab, (IMC -
1121B; LY3009806), is a recombinant human monoclonal, receptor -targeted antibody of 
the immunoglobulin G subclass 1 that specifically binds to the extracellular domain of human VEGFR -2 with high affi nity (approximately 50 pM).

all other VEGFR -2 activating ligands inclu ding VEGF -C and VEGF -D (Preclinical, Eli 
                         ADVL1 416

Lilly and Company, data on file) . Ramucirumab thus provides a highly specific and 
comprehensive inhibition of the VEGF pathway , effectively  blocking the downstream 
intracellular signaling, which results in prolifera tion, survival, and migration of 
endothelial cells.20-23 Ramucirumab may further reduce signaling by [CONTACT_531898] -2 
internalization  (Preclinical, Eli Lilly and Company, data on file) . Finally, by [CONTACT_531899] -2, ramucirumab has less potential to induce “off -target” toxicities 
seen with VEGFR -2 TKIs.   
 
Rationale for Use in Pediatrics : Although sur vival for pediatric patients with solid 
tumors has improved with more than 75% cured, prognosis is still poor for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease. These patients need innovative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_531873]. Similar to adult tumors, angiogenesis is upregulated in pediatric embryonal 
tumors making it an important pathway to target with novel anti- angiogenic agents. 
VEGF and its downstream signaling play a vital role in tumor growth and metastasis in children.  Studies have shown high le vels of circulating VEGF levels in children with 
tumors at baseline.
24,25 Neuroblastoma and Wilm’s tumor  tissues express VEGF, and high 
expression is correlated with invasion, metastasis, and risk of recurrence. 26-28 VEGF 
expression drives tumor angiogenesis and in some instances tumor growth and metastasis 
among patients with Ewing’s sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.29-31 
Among osteosarcoma patients, VEGF upregulation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.
32,33 
 The pre -clinical testing of various anti-angiogenic agents in pediatric cancers has been 
investigated with VEGF ligand or intracellular VEGF receptor inhibition. VEGF ligand 
inhibition with bevacizumab and aflibercept suppresses tumor angiogenesis and growth 
in murine models of rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and hepatoblastoma. In 
addition, aflibercept decreased the tumor vasculature resulting in regression of 
established tumors and lung metastases in an orthotopic xenograft model of Wilm’s tumor.

anthracyclines in pediatric regimens. Physeal widening was observed in a single anti -
angiogenic phase 1 trial with pazopanib; no other pediatric studies of VEGF pathway inhibitors have reported growth plate defects. Cardiotoxicities have been observed in 
some patients with prior anthracycline exposure w ho were treated with anti -angiogenic 
agents, though the pathogenesis of this cardiotoxicity and its association with VEGF 
pathway inhibition is not yet known.  Regarding efficacy, while there is minimal data on

DC101, a rat antibody targeting mouse VEGFR -2 has been used to validate the 
therapeutic utility of targeting VEGFR -2 in vivo . DC101 has pharmacological 
characteristics very similar to ramucirumab meeting the scientific criteria of a surrogate antibody. DC101 was evaluated in a pancreatic cancer BxPC -3 
xenograft model to establish an effective dose regimen and determine the associated plasma concentration to guide subsequent studies. 
48 In this model, 
significant tumor growth inhibition was observed at doses which were on average 
associated with a mi nimum serum drug concentration of 18 µg/mL . DC101 has 
demonstrated anti -tumor effect in numerous mouse xenograft solid tumor models 
that include gastric, hepatic, breast, colorect al, and non- small cell lung 
cancers.49,50 Monotherapy with DC101 produced tumor growth inhibition ( TGI) 
up to 59% (range: 27% -78%) and also produced additive effects when combined 
with chemotherapy in multiple tumor types.  Importantly, single agent DC101 
was active across a series of pediatric patient -derived xenograft (PDX) sarcoma 
models including synovial, osteo, Ewing’s, and undifferentiated histologies (TGI 
ranging from 52 % to 88%). Significant activity of DC101 was also observed in combination with doxorubicin in PDX models of Ewings sarcoma and in a mouse

2.2.2 Animal Toxicology:  
The animal toxicology studies of ramucirumab were conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys. A tissue cross- reactivity study was conducted with a full panel of 
cynomolgus monkey and human tissues that showed that the tissue reactivity  of 
ramucirumab observed in both tissues was similar, indicating that the 
cynomolgus monkey is an appropriate animal model for toxicity testing of 
ramucirumab. In a 5 -week, 4 -dose study, cynomolgus monkeys were given 
ramucirumab I.V. weekly at dose levels 0, 4, 12, or 40 mg/kg on Days 1, 15, 22, and 29, with a subset of monkeys sacrificed after the last dose and a second 
subset of monkeys entering a [ADDRESS_690486] level was 40 mg/kg, the highest dose administered. A second toxicology 
study assessed the long -term (chronic) administration of ramucirumab  in 
cynomolgus monkeys who received doses of 0, 5, 16, or 50 mg/kg administered 
intravenously every week for 12 or 39 weeks . The results revealed nephrotoxicity 
consisten t with multi- focal and marked glomerulonephritis in both kidneys in 
monkeys receiving doses of 16 and 50 mg/kg for [ADDRESS_690487] umab was also conducted at doses 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg  since there is a 
strong role for VEGF  pathway in wound healing. This study did not reveal a 
clinical or histological impairment of wound- healing in this cynomolgus monkey 
linear incision model after a si ngle dose.48 
 
2.2.3 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies : Non-compartmental analysis of the 
concentration -vs-time data from the cynomolgus monkey studies mentioned 
above indicated that the PK behavior of ramucirumab was non- linear over the 4 -
50 mg/kg dose range. Area under the concentration- vs-time curve extrapolated to 
infinity (AUC 0-inf) and maximum concentration (C max) increased in a greater than 
dose- proportional manner. Ramucirumab half -life increased and clearance 
decreased with increasing dose. Mean ramucirumab AUC 0-inf in the 50mg/kg 
group increased between the 1st and the 39th dose, indicating drug accumulation 
consistent with a saturation of receptor mediated clearance.  48

2.3.4 Safety : Adverse events (AEs) for [ADDRESS_690494] received ramucirumab 
on 7 Phase 1/1b studies, 16 open- label Phase 2 studies, and 1 Phase 3 study are 
available. Adverse drug reactions (AEs for which a causal relationship to ramuciru mab was considered at least possible ) of special interest include AEs 
which  have been associated with other anti -angiogenic agents and monoclonal 
antibodies and include the following  categories : infusion -related reaction s, 
hypertension, proteinuria, arterial thromboembolic events, bleeding/hemorrhagic 
events, and gastro -intestinal perforation.  
 
In the Phase 3, REGARD study (n=236 ramucirumab arm), the AE profile of ramucirumab was similar to the placebo. Majority of patients received full dose 
of ramucirumab (dose intensity= 99.6%) with few dose delays or modifications. 
The most common treatment emergent AE that occurred in the ramucirumab 
group versus the placebo group at a higher rate (any grade) was hypertension 
(16.1% vs 7.8%), diarrhea (14.4% vs.8.7%), and headache (9.3% vs.3.5%). The 
overall incidence of Grade 3 -5 treatment emergent AEs were similar between the 
2 groups (56.8% vs.58.3%). The most common Grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent 
AE occurring in the ramucirumab group at a higher rate was hypertension (7.2% vs. 2.6% for Grade -3 hypertension). No individual Grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent 
AE was observed i n > than 10% of patients. Serious AEs, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531874] 2 groups indicating a good 
therapeu tic-index profile for ramucirumab. Discontinuations due to AE were low 
in both groups but higher in the ramucirumab group than the placebo (10.5% 
vs.6%) with no specific AEs resulting in discontinuation. Deaths due to AEs  
were less common in ramucirumab vs. placebo group (9.3% vs.13%).  
2.3.5 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
 
Pharmacokinetic Studies : The PK of ramucirumab was first studied in patients 
with solid tumors administered across a range of doses from 2 to 16 mg/kg adminis tered weekly via 1 -hour I.V. infusions in I4T-IE-JVBM (IMCL CP12 -
0401). Apparent nonlinear PK profiles were observed between 2 and 8 mg/kg; 
PK profiles appeared to be linear at doses of 8 mg/kg and above, suggesting 
saturation of the target- mediated (VEGF  Receptor 2) clearance pathway.
17  
 
Trough concentrations (or minimum concentrations [C min]) were collected in two 
Phase 3 studies (REGARD and RAINBOW) in patients with gastric cancer.  Following the recommended clinical dose regimen of 8 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_690495] and RAINBOW ( Table 1 ). 
The geometric mean (percentage coefficient of variation [CV%])  observed 
trough values approached 50 µ g/mL before the fourth dose, and ranged between

a Trough concentrations were obtained prior to Doses 4 and 7.  They also represent C min following Doses 3 and 6.  
 
Pharmacokinetic data from the 8  studies involving 497 patients were also pooled 
together for a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis. In these studies, 
ramucirumab  was administered as a 1 -hour I.V. infusion, at either 8 mg/kg once 
every 2  weeks on a 14- or 28- day cycle, or 10 mg/kg every 3  weeks on a 21 -day 
cycle. The studies included patients with varying cancer indications:  gastric 
cancer (80.5% of patients), non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 8.2%), breast 
cancer (2.2%), colorectal cancer (CRC; 1. 6%), and other tumor types (7.4%).  
The geometric mean of PopPK model -derived estimates of ramucirumab 
clearance (CL), volume of distribution at steady state  (Vss) and terminal half -life 
(t1/2) were 0.0140 L/h (29.8%), 5.5 L (14.4%), and 15 days (24.1%), re spectively. 
These parameter estimates were consistent with those observed with other human 
monoclonal IgG1 antibodies.63 Results from the PopPK analyses indicate that the 
PK of ramucirumab following 8- and 10- mg/kg dose administrations were dose 
linear (absolute dose range:  169 to 1234 mg) and time  independent. In addition, 
covariate analysis indicated that ramucirumab PK was not affected by [CONTACT_149262] (range, 31.9 to 133.0 kg), sex, age (range, 19 to 86 years), serum albumin 
(range, 15.5 to 64.8 g/L), race (Whi te and Asian), hepatic status (as assessed by 
[CONTACT_14427]  [range, 1 to 251 IU/L], aspartate transaminase [range, 1 to 276 IU/L], alkaline phosphatase [range, 31 to 2300 IU/L], and total bilirubin 
[range, 1.2 to 78.5 µ mol/L]), and renal functi on (as assessed by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault 
creatinine clearance [range, 20.2 to 231 mL/min]).  
 
Immunogenicity :  Ramucirumab is a human monoclonal antibody with a 
potential to induce formation of anti -drug antibody (ADA) when administered to 
human. The development of ADA has been studied across 16 studies involving 
1462 evaluable patients (1033 receiving ramucirumab and 429 receiving placebo) 
and the frequency of ADA and neutralizing ADA is low.[ADDRESS_690497] baseli ne ADA sample was greater than 4 -fold higher than baseline value or 
with a titer > than 1:20. Overall the number of patients with treatment emergent 
ADA was low at 1.1% in ramucirumab- treated patients who had at least [ADDRESS_690498]

Correlative and Biological Studies : 
Pharmacodynamic circulating plasma molecular markers: Ramucirumab, 
(IMC -1121B, LY3009806) is a human receptor -targeted antibody that 
specifically blocks VEGF Receptor 2.  The binding of ramucirumab to VEGF 
Receptor [ADDRESS_690502] shown that VEGF -A levels were increased from 
baseline (range: 0 to 10 -fold) following ramucirumab administration. Since it 
prevents receptor binding of circulating VEGF , this is consistent with its 
mechanism of action. Other VEGF ligands such as VEGF -D which also bind to 
VEGFR -2 were also elevated. Placental growth factor (PlGF)  levels were also 
elevat ed from baseline (range: 0 to 20 fold), even though PlGF  has not been 
shown to bind to VEGFR -2.64,65 The mechanism of the elevation of placental 
growth factor levels is not known. Additionally, using newly- developed assays, 
correlation s between pharmacodynamics changes with tumor response and 
survival are currently ongoing for multiple ramucirumab adult Phase 3 trials.  
These analyses may provide i nsight into ramucirumab activity that could be 
important to investigate in the pediatric population as well.    
 
Circulating pharmacodynamic cellular biomarkers: To date, a c onsistent 
predictive biomarker for clinical efficacy of anti -VEGF therapy has not been 
identified. This produces challenges for clinicians in the upfront select ion of  
which patients might  benefit or not from  anti- VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In adult patients 
with gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated with sunitinib, a rise in mature circulating endothelial cells was associated with clinical benefit
66 while results 
from a Phase- I pediatric study of bevacizumab showed circulating endothelial 
cells correlated with prolonged stable disease.36 Circulating endothelial 
progenitor cells (EPCs) have been identified as predictive biomarkers of clinical 
efficacy for anti -angiogenic agents.67 However, there has been a  lack of 
consensus  in defining EPCs  leading to groupi[INVESTIGATOR_531875] “EPC”  and thus an inability  to compare  study results. Utili zing a 
novel multi- parametric flow  cytometry  (MPFC)  protocol, our group has 
identified  and defined the bona fide EPC,  nam ely  the  endothelial  c olony

The ratio of the pCHSPCs  to nCHSPCs  is a  way  to  normalize  variability  in

recommended dose in adults is 8 mg/kg IV administered over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 
patients with gastric cancer. For patients with NSCLC, the recommended dose in adults is 
10 mg/kg IV administered over [ADDRESS_690507], including dose -limiting hypertension at 10 mg/kg IV weekly, and deep 
venous thrombosis at 16 mg/kg IV weekly. Similar to other monoclonal antibodies, ramucirumab has a long half -life and is expected to accumulate.  Based on adult PK 
studies, steady state is anticipated to be achieved after the third dose administered q 2 weeks.  Initial PK studies in adults demonstrated non -dose proportional exposure at dose 
levels 2 - 8 mg/kg weekly.  At 8 mg/kg q week and above, systemic clearance decreased 
indicating a saturable receptor mediated clearance mechanism such as binding to VEGFR -2. The target trough concentration established in vitro was 18 µg/mL.   
However, in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] [ADDRESS_690508] (8 mg/kg I .V. q 2 week s, as

with increasing ramucirumab exposure. In RAINBOW  (N=321) , patients with 
ramucirumab ex posure greater than  the median (in the 3

associated with longer OS and PFS and significantly better treatment effects (smaller HR) as compared to patients with ramucirumab exposure lower than the median ( in the 1

modelling and simulation analysis indicated EC 50 value (in terms of minimum 
concentration at steady state, C min,ss) was ~ 50 ug/mL, which was also the approximate 
media nCmin,ss value in RAINBOW. It is therefore of interest to identify a dose which will 
produce C min,ss  of 50 ug/mL or higher in a majority of patients, and identify a safety 
profile so as to assist in the selection of a potentially efficacious dose for pediatric 
populations entering Phase 2 studies and beyond. 
 
Based on the safety profile in adults and the lack of DLTs at 8 mg/kg IV q 2 week dose 
level, we propose a dose finding study that, in the absence of DLTs, the recommended 
dose of ramucirumab in c hildren and adolescents will be based on achieving a C min,ss ≥ 
50 µg/mL after 3 doses of ramucirumab administered every 2 weeks (C min will be 
obtained course 1 day 42 ±[ADDRESS_690511] before dose 4).  A 
rolling 6 design will be used.  Starting dose will be 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks x 3 doses 
per 42 day course. In this pediatric trial in the absence of dose limiting toxicity that 
defines a maximum tolerated dose, we propose a dose escalation to achieve a Cmin,ss of 
50 µg/mL  in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. One 
observation from the RAINBOW and REGARD trials was a tendency for concentrations 
to be decreased  in the lower  body weight quartiles in population PK analysis . The 
planned dose escalation in children and adolescents will permit evaluation of a  higher 
dose to achieve comparable serum exposures seen in adults [personal communication 
with Eli Lilly]. If the  MTD is not exceeded (0 or 1 DLT/6 fully evaluable patients) at 8 
mg/kg dose level , a second dose level will be explored at the escalated dose of 12 mg/kg 
IV q 2 weeks x 3 doses per course. After accrual to Dose Level 2 is completed, PK comparisons from dose levels 1 and 2 will be performed. If PK analysis indicates that 
more than one patient treated at 12 mg/kg dose level has a day 4 2 C
min significantly less 
than 50 µg/mL, and the MTD has not been exceeded, additional dose levels will be 
considered.  The next dose level will be established based on C min from children who 
received 8 mg/kg/dose and 12 mg/kg/dose on this trial, and will not exceed 16 mg/kg per 
dose q 2 weeks x 3 doses (adult MTD: 13 mg/kg weekly).  If the MTD in children and 
adolescents is exceeded at 8 mg/kg IV q 2 weeks x 3 doses within the 4 2 day evaluation 
period for  toxicity during course 1, de -escalation to 6 mg/kg will be considered, and the 
recommended dose will be based on the MTD. An expansion cohort will accrue at the 
lowest tolerable dose at which C min of ≥ 50 ug/mL has been achieved in at least 5 out of 
6 eva luable patients, to acquire PK data in a representative number of young patients 
(i.e. patients < 12 years old). If at least [ADDRESS_690512] a 
steady state concentration of ramucirumab greater than 50 µg/mL, then the RP2D has  
been defined.

A cycle of therapy is considered to be 42 days.  A cycle may be repeated for a total of 8 
cycles, up to a total duration of therapy of approximately 12 months. This is an open-
label study. 
 Effort should be made to begin protocol therapy on Monday through Thursday if possible 
to accommodate correlative sample shipments.  
 Drug doses should be adjusted based on actual  weight measured  within 7 days  prior to  
the beginning of each cycle.

5.3 Dose  Escalation Schema  (Completed)  
 
5.3.1 Inter -Patient Escalation  for Part A: 
Part A of the study is an open- label, Phase  1, dose -escalation study. 
Ramucirumab will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes 
every other week for 3 infusions over a 6 -week period constituting a cycle.  The 
anticipated maximum number of evaluable subjects required to complete Part A 
is 24 patients (See Section 11.1).  
 
Patients should receive diphenhydramine  (1 mg/kg, maximum dose 50 mg)  (or 
alternative antihistamine) within 30 to 60 minutes prior to each infusion with 
ramucirumab . Anaphylactic precauti ons should be observed during ramucirumab  
administration. If ≥ Grade 2 infusional reaction occurs, the infusion should be 
stopped and supportive care given as per institutional guidelines.   
See Section 6.3  for management and dose modification guidelines for infusional 
reactions (IRR) . For the first infusion, vital signs should be monitored prior to 
infusion, every 30 (± 5) minutes during the infusion, and every 30 (± 5) minutes for a one -hour observation period after the completion of the infusion. If there is 
no evidence of an IRR during  the initial 2 infusions of ramucirumab, then no 
observation period is required for subsequent  treatment cycles. In the event an 
IRR occurs thereafter, then the one-hour observation period should be  
reinstituted.  
 
The starting dose of ramucirumab will be 8 mg/kg (dose level 1) with dose levels 
for subsequent groups of patients as follows.

There will be no escalations beyond dose level 3 (16 mg/kg). If the MTD has 
been exceeded at the first dose level, then the subsequent cohort of patients will be treated at a dose of 6 mg/kg (dose level -1). If dose level -1 is not well

accrual.  
 
Defining RP2D : After accrual to dose l evel [ADDRESS_690539] tolerable dose at which C
min of ≥ 50 ug/mL has been achieved in at least 5 
out of 6 evaluable patients to acquire PK data in a representative number of 
young patients (i.e. patients < 12 years old). If at least [ADDRESS_690540] a steady state concentration of ramucirumab greater than 
50 µg/mL, then the RP2D has been defined. If C
min,ss of ≥ 50 µg/mL has not been 
achieved in at least 5 out of 6 evaluable pati ents from dose level 2, and if the 
MTD has not yet been reached, then dose level 3 will be considered . 
 
Update:  The RP2D was determined to be 12 mg/kg. 
 
5.3.2 Part B : Once the RP2D has been determined in Part A, Part  B will open to enroll 
children with relapsed or refractory CNS tumors who will receive  ramucirumab 
at the MTD or RP2D. Part B of the study will require up to 6 evaluable patients 
enrolled at the MTD or RP2D as determined in Part A (See Section 11.1 ). 
 
5.3.3 Intra -Patient Escalation  
Intra -patient dose escalation is not allowed.  
 
5.4 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  All appropriate treatment areas should  
have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  Any 
suspected or confirmed dose -limiting toxicity should b e reported immediately (within 24 
hours) to the Study Chair. 
 
5.5 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity ( DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely attributable to protocol therapy . The DLT  observation period for the purposes

 • Monitor patient until recovery from symptoms; infusion 
rate may be slowed.  
• If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 
50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve. Monitor patient closely.  
 
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg with max 50 mg (or equivalent) 
and/or acetaminophen 10- 15 mg/kg (max 1000 mg) at least 30 
minutes before additional ramucirumab administrations, 
slowing infusion rate as above.  
Grade 2  
Rash, flushing, 
urticaria, dyspnea, 
drug fever ≥ 38°C  • Stop infusion , begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and 
treat the subject with diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg with max 
50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen  10-15 
mg/kg ( max 1000 mg); remain at bedside and monitor 
patient until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or 
bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as approp riate. 
• If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 
50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve. 
Monitor patient closely.  
•  If symptoms recur, then no further ramucirumab  will be 
administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg with max 50 mg IV (or equivalent), and remain at bedside and monitor the patient until resolution of 
symptoms.  
 
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended: diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg with max 50 mg IV (or equivalent) 
and acetaminophen (10 -15 mg/kg, max 1000 mg) should be

needed.  
• Patient should be monitored until the investigator is 
comfortable that the symptoms will not recur.  
• Ramucirumab  will be permanently discontinued. 
 
Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor 
patient until recovery from symptoms. In t he case of late-
occurring hypersensitivity symptoms ( e.g., appearance of a 
localized or generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), 
symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine, 
or corticosteroids).  
 
6.4 Dose Modifications for Hypert ension  
• Baseline blood pressure (BP) is defined as the blood pressure obtained at the 
examination used for study enrollment. This baseline BP should be obtained 
as follows:  1) Obtain [ADDRESS_690545] 5 minutes apart . Avoid using the lower 
extremity if possible. 2) Average the systolic blood pressure from the 2nd and 
3rd measurements. 3) Average the diastolic blood  pressure from the 2nd and 3rd 
measurements.  4) The baseline BP is the average of the systolic over the 
average of the diastolic measurements.  
• Elevation  in either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure should be  
considered when following the algorithm below. 
• The upper limit of normal (ULN)  is defined as a BP equal to the 95th 
percentile for age, height, and gender. See  Appendix VIII . 
• The NCI CTCAE  will be utilized to determine the grade of  hypertension for 
reporting purposes.  
• Elevated BP measurements should be repeated on the same day to confirm  the 
elevation. If confirmed, patients with elevated BP should have BP 
measurements performed at least twice weekly until BP is ≤ ULN. 
• The algorithm below will be used to manage ramucirumab - related 
hypertension. 
• Hypertension should be managed with appropriate anti -hypertensive agent(s) 
as clinically indicated. It is strongly recommended that nephrology or  
cardiology be consulted in the evaluation and management of hypertension.

treated with anti-hypertensive agents and may remain on therapy as long as hypertension is well controlled on medication (See 
Section 7.7 ). 
 
The use of b elimumab (a monoclonal antibody  for systemic lupus erythematosus) and 
bisphosphonate derivatives are prohibited while the patient is on study therapy. 
 
7.7 Concurrent Anti -Hypertensive Therapy  
The algorithm in Section 6.4  will be used to grade and manage ramucirumab - related 
hypertension. Should initiation of anti -hypertensive therapy be required, single agent 
therapy (commonly including the calcium channel blockers amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_6705], which are permissible without discussion with the study chair) should be started and the 
blood pressure should be monitored at least twice weekly until BP is within the 95
th 
percentile for age, hei ght, and gender per  Section 6.4 .

9.1.1 Description  
Ramucirumab is an anti -VEGF Receptor 2 recombinant human monoclonal 
antibody of the IgG1 subclass. It is composed of 4 polypeptide chains, 2 identical 
heavy (γ) chains consisting of 446 amino acids each, and 2 identical light (κ) 
chains consisting of 214 amino acids each. The antibody contains 1 conserved N-
linked glycosylation site at each heavy chain, in the Fc region.  All excipi[INVESTIGATOR_531884]. No 
animal -derived components are used in the manufacture of ramucirumab 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
9.1.2 Supplied by : [CONTACT_531908] . Do not use commercial supply.  
 
9.1.3 Formulation 
Ramuciruma b is supplied in single -use, 50- mL nominal volume, [LOCATION_002] 
Pharmacopeia (USP) Type I glass vials. Each vial contains 500 mg of 
ramucirumab at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in a sterile, preservative- free 
solution.  Each vial is stoppered with a chlorobu tyl elastomer stopper laminated 
with FluroTec® (West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., Exton, PA), and secured with an aluminum 2 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_531885] -top seal. The buffer contains 10mM histidine, 
75mM sodium chloride, 133mM glycine, and 0.01% polysorbate 80. Ramucirum ab is a clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow 
liquid without visible particles. The pH is 6.0. The osmolality is 285 mmol/kg.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_690573] vials of ramucirumab refrigerated at 2 -8 °C (36- 46°F). Protect from 
light. DO NOT FR EEZE OR SHAKE. The formulation contains no 
preservatives.  
 Prepared dosing solution should be used immediately in order to minimize the 
risk of microbial contamination. If not used immediately, the prepared 
ramucirumab dosing solution should be stored under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C 
(36°F to 46°F), for a duration not to exceed 24 hours. If the prepared solution is 
stored at room temperature (below 25°C [77°F]), it must be used within [ADDRESS_690574]. DO NOT FREEZE AND/OR SHAKE PREPARED RAMUCIRUMAB FOR INFUSION.  
 
9.1.5 Solution Preparation  
Ramucirumab is compatible with common infusion containers. The use of a low 
protein binding 0.22 micron in–line filter is required . Aseptic technique is to be 
used when preparing and handling ramucirumab for infusion. Drug doses should be adjusted based on actual weight measured within 7 days prior to the beginning 
of each cycle. Based on the calculated volume of ramucirumab, add (or remove 
from pre -filled [with 0.9% normal saline] I.V infusion container) a sufficient 
quantity of sterile normal saline (0.9% weight/volume) to the container to a 
concentration > 0.4 mg/mL by [CONTACT_531909] 100 mL for pa tients 
weighing 8-25 kg, and total volume 250 mL for patients weighing > 25 kg . For 
patients < [ADDRESS_690575] 50 mL and concentration should 
be > 0.4 mg/mL. Do not use dextrose containing solutions. The container should 
be gently inve rted to ensure adequate mixing.

Version Date: 01/31/19 
 
9.1.6 Stability  
Prepared solutions of ramucirumab are stable for up to 24 hours refrigerated (2 – 
8° C).  If the prepared solution is stored at room temperature (below 25°C 
[77°F]), it must be used within 4 hours. 
 
9.1.7 Administration  
See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol. 
Patients should receive premedication with diphenhydramine or alternative 
antihistamine within 30 to 60 minutes prior to each infusion with ramucirumab 
(see Section 5.3.1 ). The infusion should be delivered via infusion pump over 60 
minutes. The infusion rate should not exceed 25 mg/minute. Infusions of duration 
longer than 60 minutes are permitted in specific circumstances (that is, for larger 
patien ts in order to maintain an infusion rate that does not exceed 25 mg/minute, 
or in the setting of prior ramucirumab infusion- related reaction); the infusion 
duration must always be accurately recorded. The infusion set must be flushed 
post infusion with sterile sodium chloride 0.9% equal to or greater than infusion 
set holdup volume to ensure delivery of the calculated dose. 
 
9.1.8 Ramucirumab Toxicities  
The toxicities in the table below are based on version 15.0 of the Investigator’s 
Brochure and US prescribing information data from single agent trials. The following events have been observed in patients receiving single agent 
ramucirumab  in clinical trials  or are potential toxicities for anti -angiogenic 
agents.

Pregnancy & 
Lactation Pregnancy  
Discontinue use in pregnant women. Animal studies have not been 
specifically conducted to evaluate the effect of ramucirumab on female 
reproduction and fetal development, and there are no studies in 
pregnant women. Based on ramucirumab’s mechanism of action, it is 
likely to inhibit angiogen esis and may potentially result in adverse 
effects during pregnancy and postnatal development. Patients (male 
and female) of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective 
                         ADVL1 416

11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
The study will be completed in 2 parts. Part A will be a dose -escalation phase including 
patients with non -CNS solid tumors, and Part B will include a safety and imaging 
evaluation in patients with CNS tumors. 
 
                         ADVL1 416 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY

Version Date: 01/31/19 
 
A minimum of 2 evaluable patients will be entered at each dose level for determination of 
MTD. Once the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose has been defined, up to 6 additional 
patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors without restrictions on hem atologic 
evaluability may be enrolled to acquire PK data in a representative n umber of young 
patients ( e.g six  patients < 12 years old  and six patients  ≥12 years old).  Review of the 
enrollment rate into previous COG new agent studies indicates that 1 -2 patients per 
month are available.  The anticipated maximum number of evaluable subjects required to 
complete Part A is 24 patients. Assuming a 20% inevaluable rate, 29 patients may be 
enrolled and the study would be expected to be completed within 15- 29 months. A 
maximum of 51 patients may be required in the unlikely event that each of the three dose levels are expanded to 12 because two DLTs of different types are observed at each of the three dose levels, 6 additional patients are needed for PK analysis, and a 20% inevaluable 
rate. The maximum of 51 would be completed within 26- 51 months. 
 Part B of the study will require  up to 6 evaluable patients  enrolled at the MTD or RP2D 
as determined in Part A . Allowing for 20% inevaluability, [ADDRESS_690581] one dose of the study drug(s) and who 
experiences a dose- limiting toxicity  is considered evaluable for Adverse E vents . 
In addition, during Cycle 1, patients must have the appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed to be considered evaluable for dose lim iting 
toxicity. Patients who do not have DLT and do not receive at least 85% of the 
prescribed dose within the first cycle for reasons other than toxicit ies (e.g. 
progressive disease) will not be considered evaluable for toxicity and will be 
replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose 
• The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one-third of 
patients experience DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy.  
 
• In the event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients ar e different 
classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), expansion of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered if all of the 
following conditions are met:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose- related  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, 
and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable 
 
If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose- limiting 
toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.

Version Date: 01/31/19 
 
• The DLTs  observed in the pharmacokinetic (PK) expansion cohort will be 
counted towards the total number of DLTs observed at the MTD during the 
dose escalation portion of the study. If ≥ 1/3 of the cohort of patients at the 
MTD (during the dose escalation plus the PK expansion) experience DLT 
then the MTD will be exceeded.  
 
11.2.3  Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) :  
After accrual to dose l evel [ADDRESS_690582] tolerable dose at which C
min of ≥ 50 ug/mL has been achieved in at least 5 out of 6 
evaluable patients  to acquire PK data in a representative number of young 
patients (i.e. patients < 12 years old). If at least [ADDRESS_690583] a steady state concentration of ramucirumab greater than 50 µg/mL, 
then the RP2D has been defined. If C
min,ss of ≥ 50 µg/mL has not been achieved in 
at least [ADDRESS_690584] of this study. 
82 Two to 
six patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the 
number of patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have 
experienced DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients  entered but 
with tolerability data pending at the current dose level.  Accrual is suspended when a 
cohort of six has enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.  
  
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the 
cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a DLT (i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable for toxicity). 
For example, when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicit y data is 
available for all three when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and the fourth participant is enrolled to the subsequent dose level. If data is 
not yet available for one or more of the first three particip ants and no DLT has been 
observed , or if one DLT has been observed, the new participant is entered at the same 
dose level.  Lastly, if two or more DLTs have been observed, the dose level is de -
escalated. This process is repeated for participants five and si x. In place of suspending 
accrual after every three participants, accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de -escalation  rules have not been fulfilled at the time 
the next available participant is enrolled onto the study. 
 
 
The following table provides the decision rules for enrolling a patient at (i) the current dose level (ii) at an escalated dose level, (iii) at a de- escalated dose level, or whether the 
study is suspended to accrual:

* If six patients already entered at next lower dose level, the MTD has been defined.  
**If final dose level has been reached, the recommended dose has been reached.  
 
If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients experience DLT at a given dose level, then 
the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be stopped (see Section 11.2.2  for 
exception to rule). If there are no further dose escalations based on toxicity assessment , 
then the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D ) will be confirmed  as per  Section 11.2.[ADDRESS_690585] be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the 
one hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on 
the other. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are 
noted, accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate 
those differences more fully.  
  
11.5 Pharmacokinetic and Correlative Studies and Response Analysis  
 
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ramucirumab  will be 
performed to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics . 
                         ADVL1 416

reported descriptively. 
 All these analyses will be descriptive in nature. 
 
11.6 Statistical methods  
 
11.6.1  Analysis Sets  
Safety Analysis Set (SAS) will consist of subjects who receive any amount  of 
study drug.  
 
11.6.2  Dose Evaluable Set (DES)  will con sist of: 1) subjects who receive any amount 
of study drug and then experience DLT during Cycle 1; and 2) subjects who 
receive at least 85% of the prescribed dose in Cycle [ADDRESS_690587] cycle. DES will be used for evalu ation of each dose level 
for dose- escalation.  
 
11.6.3  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set  (PAS) will include subjects who have sufficient 
PK data to derive at least one PK parameter .  
 
11.6.4  Efficacy Analyses:  
Preliminary efficacy analyses will also be performed by [CONTACT_531912]. Data cut -off for primary study analysis will occur when all 
enrolled subjects have completed 6 cycles of treatment or discontinued study 
drug administration. After the final analysis, additional analyses may be performed as appropriate.  
 
11.6.5  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Serum  concentrations of Ramucirumab  will be tabulated and summarized by 
[CONTACT_354566]. Ramucirumab  PK parameters will be derived from serum  
concentrations by [CONTACT_105]- compartmental analyses using actual times. Minimally, the 
following PK parameters will be calculated: C max, tmax, and AUC (t ½, CL, and 
Vd ss will be calculated only if the data permit ). Additional analysis utilizing the 
population pharmacokinetic approach may also be conducted if deemed 
appropriate.

12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA 
 
12.1 Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.[ADDRESS_690590] access to a c opy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.   
12.1.1  Adverse Event (AE or Adverse Experience): Any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal  (investigational) product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product 
(attribution of Unrelated [“unrelated”, “unlikely”] or Related [“possible”, 
“probable”, or “definite”]). (International Conference on Harmonisation [IC H] 
E2A, E6). 
 
12.1.[ADDRESS_690591] be reported routinely as 
outlined in the protocol (see Section 13.5 ). All Serious AEs (as defined in  Table 
A in Section 13.1 ) must be reported expeditiously. For detailed AE reporting 
guidelines refer to the “NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event 
Reporting Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs”:    
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm . 
 
12.1.[ADDRESS_690592] of monitoring and recording all AEs, including all CTCAE v  4.0 grades (for both increasing and decreasing severity) and SAEs; 
regular laboratory evaluation for  hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; 
periodic measurement of vital signs;  and the performance of physical 
examinations. 
 
12.2 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors  
See the table in section 8.0
 for the schedule of tumor evaluations. In addition to the 
scheduled scans, a confirmatory scan should be obtained the next consecutive cycle 
following initial documentation of objective response.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-
247, 2009].  Key points are that [ADDRESS_690593]  diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  
diameter of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria. 
 
12.2.1  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response : Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle [ADDRESS_690594] had their disease re- evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for response.  
                         ADVL1 416 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
57 
Version Date: 01/31/19 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of 
measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and  
have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
non-target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
12.2.2  Disease Parameters  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease: Measurable l esions are defined as those that can 
be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to 
be recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_690595] x -ray, as ≥[ADDRESS_690596] scan, or 
≥[ADDRESS_690597] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
might or might not be considered measurable.  If the 
investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions 
under which such lesions should be considered must be defined 
in the protocol. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_690598] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  
At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and 
followed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), 
including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-
measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by 
[CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patien t, 
these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_690599] ed and measured at 
baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
                         ADVL1 416 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
58 
Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_690600] lesion that can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will  be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesi ons should be 
identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.2.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler 
or calipers.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion  at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_147877](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
[CONTACT_461].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only  be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph 
nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin 
nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to es timate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable 
lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability 
of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_690601] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans). Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.

59 
Version Date: 01/31/19 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion 
of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality 
for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can 
document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements 
and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET 
portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an 
investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess 
response.  If markers are initially above the upper normal limi t, they 
must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesi ons in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
   Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG -PET:  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, 
it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the  basis of FDG-
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow- up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG- PET at 
follow- up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly  progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be 
the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease 
on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomi c images, 
this is not PD. 
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

12.2.4  Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non- target) must have reduction in 
short axis to <[ADDRESS_690602] be detected by [CONTACT_531914].  Normalization of urinary 
catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for patients with 
neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum  of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered 
progressions). Note:  in presence  of SD or PR in 
target disease but unequivocal progression in 
non-target or non- measurable disease, the 
patient has PD  if there is an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non- target disease such 
that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently  to merit discontinuation of therapy 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking

[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis) 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.

Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.     
 
12.2.[ADDRESS_690603] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes 
of analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in 
Section 12.[ADDRESS_690604] one dimension.  Such lesions may be evaluable by [CONTACT_531915], immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers or other reliable measures.
  
 
12.3.2  Complete Response  
Disappearance of all evaluable disease.  
 
12.3.3  Partial response  
Partial responses cannot be determined in patients with evaluable disease  
 
12.3.4  Stable Disease (SD)  
That which does not qualify as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), 
or Progressive Disease.  
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_690605] Response Assessment

12.4.2 The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_6778]:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Partial Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions 
Progressive disease: Development of new MIBG positive lesions 
 
12.4.3 The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review respon ses will be used to assess 
efficacy for study endpoint. See Section 8.3.2  for details on transferring images 
to the Imaging Research Center.  
 NOTE: This scoring should also be done by [CONTACT_6779].  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 
10
th general sector allocated for any extra- osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . 
In each region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extens ion score is 
graded as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by [CONTACT_6780]. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
 
 
The relative score  is calculated by [CONTACT_99239] -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Complete response : all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.

2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced). 
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly 
reduced) to 1.0 (lesions not reduced). 
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_690608] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes 
of analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of 
the overall response assessments as described in  Table 5 in Section 12.7 . 
 
12.5  Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
12.5.1  Bone Marrow Involvement  
Bone marrow obtained within 14 days prior to study enrollment with tumor cells 
seen on routine morphology (not by [CONTACT_442837]) of bilateral aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99203]. 
 
Bone Marrow responses are determined by H&E Staining of bilateral bone 
marrow biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].  
 
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_6785] [ADDRESS_690609] 21 days apart. Normalization of 
urinary catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment.  
 
Progressive Disease :  In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone 
marrow by [CONTACT_527323] a doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by 
[CONTACT_5293]. (For example, a patient entering with 5% tumor in marrow by [CONTACT_6787] ≥ 25% 
tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering 
with 30% tumor must increase to > 60%). 
 
In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma in bone marrow will be defined as 
progressive disease if tumor is detected in [ADDRESS_690610] 21 
days apart.  
 
Stable Disease: Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not me et 
the criteria for either complete response or progressive 
disease.

Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_690612] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is 
considered a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should 
be selected as “target” lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be 
followed as non- target lesions.  The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should 
be at least twice the thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the 
partial volume effect (e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice).  
 
Any change in size of non -target lesions should be noted, though does not need to 
be measured.  
 
12.6.[ADDRESS_690613] perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in 
any established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response 
in other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial baseline measurements.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products 
of the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the sum of the products 
of the perpendicular diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the products observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.

12.6.5  Response Criteria for Non- Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non- target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  
 
12.6.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
 
12.6.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and 
non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table below. The 
overall response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the 
assessments of target, non -target, marker and new lesions in the preceding 
columns.

 Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes 
of analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 12.[ADDRESS_690614] response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  Th e patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement 
of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

12.7.2  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for prog ressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  This will be described by [CONTACT_531916]. 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time mea surement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the 
baseline measurements. This will be described by [CONTACT_531917].

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the Case Report 
Forms  for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited 
manner to allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information about expedited reporting. 
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered 
serious; 3 ) the grade  (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332821].  
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label. 
 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distribut or, may on some occasions 
distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
All CTCAE v 5.0 codable AEs are considered reportable for this study . For detailed AE 
reporting guidelines refer to the “NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs”:    
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm. 
 
13.1 Steps to Determin e If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.0.  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web 
site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Step 3:  Review Table A in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious; 
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of 
specific adverse events that require special monitoring;  
 
Note :  This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_690615] dose of treatment and is attributed as Related (possibly, probably, or 
definitely) to the agent(s) must al so be reported according to the 
instructions in the table  below . Attribution categories are as follows:  
Unrelated ( Unrelated, Unlikely); Related  (Possible, Probable, and 
Definite ).

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persis tent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported via CTEP -AERS within 
the timeframes detailed in the table below.

• Any adverse event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital 
anomalies, or birth defects or exposure to study drug through breastfeeding  must be reported via 
CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs following treatment with the study drug . 
 
• Use the NCI protocol nu mber and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial 
registration on all reports.   
Additional Instructions or Exceptions to CTEP -AERS  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Phase 1 
Trials Utilizing an Agent under a CTEP -IND or Non -CTEP IND:  
 
• Death  due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease progression ” in the 
system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions”.  Evidence that 
the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor 
growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be 
submitted.  
 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_690619] dose, regardless of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention requires  expedited reporting within 24 hours.  
 
• Any death that occurs more than [ADDRESS_690620] dose of treatment with an investigational 
agent which can be attributed as Related  (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not 
clearly due to progres sive disease must be reported via CTEP -AERS  for an agent under a CTEP 
or non- CTEP IND agent  per the timelines outlined in the table above. 
 
• Myelosuppression, (Grade 1 through Grade 4 adverse events as defined in the table below), does 
not require expedited reporting , unless it is associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Category  Adverse Events  
INVESTIGATIONS  Platelet count decreased  
INVESTIGATIONS  White blood cell decreased  
INVESTIGATIONS  Neutrophil count decreased  
INVESTIGATIONS  Lymphocyte count decreased  
BLOOD/LYMPHATICS DISORDERS  Anemia   
As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that resolves and then recurs 
during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS  reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) via the 
web at http://ctep. cancer.gov (email the ADVL1416 COG Study Assigned Research 
Coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS 24 -
Hour Notification web- based application is unavailable) and by [CONTACT_531918] . Once internet connec tivity is restored, a [ADDRESS_690621] be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by [CONTACT_433].  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event (refer to Table A ). 
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP- AERS  (Adverse Event

AERS  and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm reporting requirements for 
this protocol (see data submission packet).  Submit the completed CTEP -AERS  report 
within 14 days  of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring after protocol treatment for cancer . 
  Secondary Malignancy :  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment must  be reported via CTEP -
AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  (e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML])   
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)   
3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy.  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also 
be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
Second Malignancy :  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
 
13.7 Reporting Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal 
When submitting CTEP -AERS  reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and emailed to the 
ADVL1416 COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator  along with any additional 
medical information  along with any additional medical information . The potential risk of 
exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS  report.

• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
occurring on study or within [ADDRESS_690627] dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP- AERS  as 
Grade 3  “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(Pregnancy) ” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions” System Organ Class ( SOC ). 
 
• Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is known. If the baby [CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anom aly, then a second CTEP -AERS report is 
required. 
 
13.7.2  Pregnancy Loss (Fetal Death)  
• Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.”  
• Any pregnancy loss  should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4  
“Pregnancy loss”  under the  “Pregnancy, puerperium and pe rinatal 
conditions” SOC . Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event 
since CTEP -AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
13.7.3  Death Neonatal  
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “Newborn deaths occurring 
during the first 28 days after birth”  that is felt by  [CONTACT_349662]/intervention, should be 
reported expeditiously. 
 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 ”Death 
neonatal” under the “General disorders and administration” SOC when 
the death is the result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in 
partners of men on study  
 
• Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men  as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS 
recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is known at intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. The “Pregnancy Information Form” 
should be used for all necessary follow-ups. This form  is available at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyRepo

APPENDIX IX :  URINE PROTEIN TO CREATININE (UPC) RATIO  
 
 
Clinical Meaning of UPC  
There is a good correlation between the ratio of urine protein to creatinine concentrations (UPC) in a 
random urine sample and the amount  of protein excreted in a 24- hour urine collection period.83 Thus, the 
UPC allows for an estimation of the 24- hour urine protein excretion from a random sample.  The 
creatinine excretion is fairly constant throughout the day regardless of changes in urine flow  rate:  
• Men excrete 20 mg to 25 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day 
• Women excrete 15 mg to 20 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day 
• Normal protein excretion is <100 mg to 150 mg per 24 hours. 
• The UPC ratio is roughly equal to the 24 hour urine protein excretion in g/day 
 
 
Calculating UPC Ratio 
UPC ratio = (Urine protein [mg/dL]) / (urine creatinine [mg/dL]) = numerically equivalent to grams (g) protein excreted in urine over 24 hours.  
 
Example :  If a s ubject has a urine protein of  90 mg/dL and urine cre atinine of 30 mg/dL ,   
then UPC ratio =  90 ( mg/dL)   = 3 
30 (mg/dL)  
Result UPC is 3 correlat ing to roughly 3g of protein excretion in a 24-hour period. 
  
Units for UPC ratio  
UPC is a calculated ratio. The guidelines in the protocol are based on having urine protein and urine 
creatinine measured in the same units (e.g., mg/dL). The SI units for urine protein and urine creatinine are 
not the same, so these must be converted to mg/dL before calculating the ratio.  For reference, the 
conversion factors for commonly used units for protein and creatinine are provided below. 
 
Starting units  Conversion to mg/dL  
Protein (g/L)  Multiply by 100  
Creatinine ( µmol/L)  Divide by 88.4  
Creatinine (mmol/L)  Multiply by 11.3

APPENDIX XI: CTEP AND CTSU REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) policy require all 
individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored trials to register and to renew their registration annually.  To 
register, all individuals must obtain a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access 
Management (IAM) account (https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ).  In addition, persons with a registration 
type of Investigator (IVR), Non- Physician Invest igator (NPI[INVESTIGATOR_6731]), or Associate Plus (AP) (i.e., clinical site 
staff requiring write access to OPEN, RAVE, or TRIAD or acting as a primary site contact) must complete 
their annual registration using CTEP’s web- based Registration and Credential Repository (RCR ) 
(https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/rcr).  Documentation requirements per registration type are outlined in the table below.

CTSU Registration Procedures 
 
This study is supported by [CONTACT_6818] (CTSU). 
 
IRB Approval:   
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office before they can 
be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site registration status in the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination o f whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory 
criteria including but not limited to the following: 
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number  
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization 
• A valid IRB approval 
• Complia nce with all protocol specific requirements. 
 
In addition, the site- protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active registration status  
• The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572 
• An active status on  a participating roster at the registering site.  
 ites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by [CONTACT_360432]. For sites using the CIRB, IRB 
approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated process. Signatory Institutions  must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB via 
IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study local ly.  The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then 
communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for the SSW approval to be processed, the Signatory Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the 
Signatory Institution a re participating in the study. 
 
Requirements F or ADVL1416  Site Registration:  
 
• IRB approval (For sites not participating via the NCI CIRB; local IRB documentation, an IRB-signed 
CTSU IRB Certification Form, Protocol of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB 
Certification/Declaration of Exemption Form, or combination is accepted ) 
• For applicable studies with a radiation and/or imaging (RTI) component, the enrolling site must be aligned to a RTI provider.  To manage provider associations access the Provider Association tab on the CTSU website at  https://www.ctsu.org/RSS/RTFProviderAssociation
, to add or remove 
associated providers.  Sites must be linked to at least one IROC credentialed provid er to participate on 
trials with an RT component. Enrolling sites are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate agreements are in place with their RTI provider, and that appropriate IRB approvals are in place.

1) Objectives: 
In this project we propose to conduct a 4-week open label cognitive enhancement trial of 
isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70824] [ADDRESS_77192] in a majority of patients even when positive psychotic symptoms are 
well-controlled, and they account for a large proportion of the variance in explaining 
function
al disability (Keefe et al. 2007). This has led to a focused effort to target the 
specific treatment of cognition in patients with schizophrenia (Green and Nuechterlein, 
2004), with somewhat limited success to date. 
 
Novel treatment options have been limited by [CONTACT_70842]; however, recent data from the field of genomics 
have prov
ided insights into the molecular underpi[INVESTIGATOR_70825]. The majority of genetic risk loci identified to date show trans-
disorder effects, increasing susceptibility across a broad range of neuropsychiatric 
disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Williams et al. 2011; Purcell 
2009). One possible explanation for this overlap is that several of these genes are 
influencing risk via their effects on shared phenotypes such as neurocognitive 
dysfunction. One such example is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs1006737) in 
the calcium channel gene, CACNA1C; initially associated with bipolar illness (Sklar et 
al. 2008; 2011; Ferriera et al 2008) but also linked with schizophrenia (Green et al. 2009; 
Nyegaard et al. 2010) and recurrent major depression (Green et al, 2009). The strength of

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_77193] evaluated the effects of CACNA1C variation on neurocognitive 
capacity. 
2) Background 
CACNA1C rs1006737 has been shown to affect neural networks underlying reward and 
emotional processing (Bigos et al. 2010; Wessa et al. 2010), verbal fluency (Krug et al. 
2010), alerting and orienting aspects of attention (Thimm et al. 2011), and executive 
functions (Bigos et al. 2010). CACNA1C is responsible for coding the L-type voltage-
gated calcium channel Cav1.2, which has been shown to be involved in synaptic 
plasticity, learning and memory in an NMDA-independent manner (Woodside et al. 
2004; Moosmang et al. 2005; White et al. 2008) and CACNA1C knock-out mice show 
notable defic
its in long term potentiation (Striessnig et al. 2006).  These convergent data 
suggest that variation within CACNA1C may play a critical role in the development of 
neuroc
ognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and may point toward a novel 
treatment strategy targeting calcium channel dysfunction for these disabling symptoms. 
 
Dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and excess calcium signaling have been 
hypothesiz
ed to underlie multiple pathogenic processes in schizophrenia, including 
dopaminergic hyperactivity and hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
receptor (Bojarki et al. 2010). In selecting an intervention, we considered the numerous 
calcium-channel blockers that are widely utilized as anti-hypertensives; however, we 
chose isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70826]1.2 channel subtype and its superior blood-
brain barrier penetrance.  
 
3) Setting of the Human Research 
The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) site has ideal facilities for the 
proposed study. The research activities will be conducted in the Laboratory of 
Neurocognition located at 53-[ADDRESS_77194] floor suite. This space, completely 
renovated in 2014, c
onsists of a seven-room suite with ample space for research staff, 
interview rooms, and an exam room.  
 
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research 
The current study will be performed in the Department of Psychiatry, located at the Icahn 
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS).  Referrals will primarily come from 
Manhattan based Mount Sinai Health System  Outpatient Psychiatry Departments.  These 
will include the Mount S
inai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Beth Israel, and St. Luke’s Roosevelt.

Revised  9/2/14 5) Study Design 
a) Recruitment Methods 
Subjects will be recruited from the outpatient clinical services of the Mount Sinai Health 
System as described above.  Potentially eligible patients are identified by [CONTACT_102]’s 
clinica
l care provider (nurse practitioner and/or physician), who would then ask the 
patient’s permission for our research team to approach and explain the protocol.  A 
research team member will approach that individual and explain the study objectives, 
procedures, risks and benefits, and begin the informed consent process if the patient 
wishes to. We will also utilize IRB approved community based advertisements.  
b) Incl
usion and Exclusion Criteria 
Inclusion criteria: 1. Age 18-60; 2. DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective diagnosis; 
3. Re
sidual phase of illness criteria met at screen and baseline as defined by [CONTACT_70843] < 4 on each of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) hallucinatory behavior, 
unusual thought content, and conceptual disorganization items; 4. Hamilton Rating Scale 
for Dep
ression (HRSD) < 12; 5. Baseline Clinician Administered Ratings Scale for 
Mania (CARS-M) score of <5; 6. Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) total score of < 6; 7. 
Treatment with at least one but no more than two stably-dosed second-generation 
antipsychotic medication (other than clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for > [ADDRESS_77195] generation antipsychotics and clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_70827]. Initial baseline cognitive functioning will not 
be evaluated as inclusion/exclusion criterion because schizophrenia/schizoaffective 
disorder have a relatively cognitively homogeneous patient sample. We do not anticipate 
any subjects without cognitive impairment. We will cover for baseline performance to 
determine if degree of cognitive impairment at baseline is responsible for any change 
noted. 
Exclusion criteria:  1. History of CNS trauma, neurological disorder, ADHD, mental 
retardation, learning disability, or other non-schizophrenic cause of cognitive 
impairment; 2. DSM-IV diagnosis of substance abuse/dependence within 3 months or 
positive
 urine toxicology at screening that is not consistent with what participant 
reported. Substance abuse and dependence are determined based on an extremely 
comprehensive interview (the SCID), which evaluates lifetime history and current history 
of all substance use disorders. As per the protocol, DSM-IV diagnosis of substance abuse 
or dependence within 3 months will be exclusionary (not substance use) ; 3. Pregnant 
women or wome
n of child bearing potential who are not using a medically accepted 
means of contraception (including oral contraceptive or implant, condom, diaphragm, 
spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or partner with vasectomy) 4. Women who 
are br
eastfeeding; 5. Active, unstable medical problem that may interfere with cognition; 
6. Current treatment for hypertension; 7. Uncontrolled hypertension; 8. History of heart

3 > 2).  Conc
omitant Medications: Practical and ethical considerations prevent an 
exclusive focus on medication-free patients; however, we will limit participation to 
individuals taking at least one and no more than [ADDRESS_77196] within 12 months. Medication load 
will be incorporated as covariates in statistical analyses using chlorpromazine (CPZ) 
equivalents. 
c) Number of Subjects 
Up to 80 stable schizophrenia and schizoaffective patients will be recruited from the 
Mount Sinai 
Health System Outpatient Departments, and community advertisements. 
d) Study Ti
melines 
The recruitment and enrollment process will be active for approximately 24 months.  The 
antic
ipated final date for this study is 7/2017.  The patients will be informed of the length 
of the study
, which will include [ADDRESS_77197] dose of 
medication is taken (baseline) where blood pressure will be checked , 4 weeks of 
medicati
on administration and weekly monitoring , and a visit eight hours after the dosage 
of the medica tion is increased (week 2) where blood pressure will be checked .  They will 
be informed of all of the study procedures for each week, including assessments and 
medical tests.  
e) Study Endpoints 
The primary endpoint related to the efficacy of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70828] (MCCB).  The MCCB is 
accepted by [CONTACT_4760] a primary outcome measure for registry trials of cognitive 
enhancement in schizophrenia. 
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research 
All eli
gible subjects will undergo visits at screening, baseline (week 0), visit 8 hours after 
week 0, 
week 1, week 2, visit 8 hours after week 2, week 3, and week 4  (end of study). 
The parameters of study drug dosing are as follows: i sradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70829] t his trial will 
be administered twice daily . Isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70830]: baseline (week 0) 5 
mg/day BID; Week 2 increase to 10 mg/day BID if 5 mg was well -toler ated. Dosing will 
be flexible  based on side effects with a maximum=10 mg/day. If [ADDRESS_77198] will be discontinued. Dosing was based on package labeling for 
hypertension and prior studies in Parkinson’s disease (Simuni et al. 2010).

Revised  9/2/14 h)  Data Management and Confidentiality 
If a participant agrees to be in this study, we will collect health information that identifies 
them, “Protected Health Information” (PHI). We may collect the results of tests, 
questionnaires and interviews. We may collect information from a patient’s medical 
record.  We will only collect information that is needed for the research. This information 
is described in the consent form. By [CONTACT_17317] a participant gives us 
permission (authorization) to collect, use and share their health information. 
Data collected will include questionnaires and assessments as described above in section 
(5f). Labs and tests will be done at the ISMMS laboratory and information sent to the PI, 
data for
 these will be stored in a binder which will be secured in a double locked fashion. 
Blood samples will be labeled with de-identified codes, which cannot be associated with 
individual subjects. PHI, such as patient name [CONTACT_70857], will only be included in a 
separate file including the consent documents. All other data collected for the study will 
be de-identified and stored apart from PHI, identified by [CONTACT_70844] a 
secure file. This data will be stored indefinitely. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_70831]. 
Quality control of the data collected will include double data entry and data quality check 
by [CONTACT_70845] [ADDRESS_77202] access to data and records may be reviewed by [CONTACT_70846] (i.e. NIH) in order to 
meet federal or state research regulations.  Please be aware that once private information 
is disclosed, it
 is subject to re-disclosure by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_70832].  If research records are used for decisions related to clinical care, then a 
participant has the right to review this information and to request changes. This is limited 
to information about their treatment, and does not include information related to 
procedures or tests that are for research purposes only. Participants may access this 
information only after the study analysis is complete.   
  
Data from this study may be used in medical publications or presentations.  The 
information will be de-identified so that individual subjects cannot be recognized and the 
information will no longer be considered PHI.  The information that is collected for 
research will be analyzed for many years and it is not possible to know how long this 
analysis and follow-up will take. Therefore, participants are allowing access to this 
information indefinitely. 
Subjects will only be identified with a numerical code in compliance with HIPAA 
regulations
. Raw subject data will be secured in double locked physical control. Digitized 
raw data will be similarly de-identified using coding and will be secured on an MS SQL 
server with Windows integrated security.

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_77203] order autoregressive 
covariance structure to evaluate change over time for all of the primary outcome 
measures.  Cognitive measures will be handled differently, as these will only be collected 
at two time points – if missing data are substantial (or a complete visit is missing), 
subjec
ts’ data will not/cannot be meaningfully analyzed. 
Primary Analyses  will test the following hypotheses based on our specific aims:  
To determine the feasibility of 4 weeks of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70833]. 
Hypothesis: We will successfully recruit up to 80 stable schizophrenia and 
schizoa
ffective patients 
 
To determine the safety of 4 weeks of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70833]. 
Hypothesis: The frequency of new or worsened side effects (clinician-rated; self-
reported; lab-based) will not be significantly different from baseline to end of study visit. 
 
A Fisher exact test will compare time-points by [CONTACT_70847] 
(compare
d with baseline) side effect severity ratings – this will be done for all side 
effe
cts assessed by [CONTACT_70848]. 
 
Differences on laboratory measures (chemistry panel, etc.) will be tested using repeated 
measures A
NCOVA (baseline and week 4) and changes in vital signs (specifically blood 
pressure) will be assessed using mixed model ANCOVA, to incorporate data at each 
weekly visit. 
 
Differences on SAS and AIMS total scores will be examined by [CONTACT_70849] τ-b rank 
correlation between score and week for each subject and comparing the distribution of 
these trend scores with the Conover-Salsburg rank test.  
i) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of subjects 
Safety monitoring will be done on a patient by [CONTACT_70850] [INVESTIGATOR_70834]. Side effects will be monitored closely and all AEs recorded. 
To increa
se safety, a blood pressure check will be done within [ADDRESS_77204] dose  
(baseline). Staff contact [CONTACT_70851] 8 hour BP check.   Additionally, a blood pressure check will 
be done within 8 hours of increasing the dosage (week 2).

j) Withdrawal of Subjects 
If
 they choose to consent to the study and are eligible to begin the trial, they will be 
closely monitored and will visit with the study coordinator and study physician.  Side 
effects will be rated weekly at each visit using an adverse events checklist completed by a 
study physician.  Subjects with an exacerbation of psychosis/depression/mania on a 2-
point CGI-change score will be discontinued and treated appropriately by [CONTACT_7357].  Suicidal ideation will be assessed at each visit with the Beck (SSI) and the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).  Significant suicidal ideation will be 
addressed immediately using the standard clinical response at ISMMS (evaluation at the 
walk-
in clinic/psychiatric emergency room for potential need to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18552]).  Subjects at 
risk for sui
cidal behavior will be discontinued. Subjects with any other clinical worsening 
as noted by [CONTACT_70852], and any instance of an SAE will be discontinued. In 
addition, subjects who exhibit any inability to follow the protocol with be discontinued 
and withdrawn from the study.  
To ensure orderly termination from the study, the study physician would meet with the 
subject to discuss termination and discontinuation of medication. Safety measures would 
be collected and a follow-up visit by [CONTACT_70853]. Discontinuing isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70835] a taper. We will schedule an 
in-person visit if necessary after the follow-up visit by [CONTACT_70854].  
Subjects may withdraw from the study for any reason at any time by [CONTACT_70855] [INVESTIGATOR_70836]. It is also possible to withdraw 
permission for the use and disclosure of any protected information for research, but it 
must be done in writing to the principal investigator. In the event permission is 
withdrawn, infor
mation that was already collected may still be used if that information is 
nece
ssary to complete the research study.

Revised  9/2/14 throughout the study period using standardized rating scales described above in 5 f). At 
each weekly visit the study physician will meet with the patients and conduct a thorough 
review of s
ymptoms including psychosis, mood, and suicidal/homicidal ideation. If there 
is an acute worsening of symptoms the study clinicians will review the case with the PI 
(or will make an emergency decision as needed) to ensure that the subject receives 
emergency care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Participation in the study will be discontinued in any 
case of clear symptom worsening. Between weekly visits, the patients will have 
emergency contact [CONTACT_3031].  
Along with closel
y monitoring for symptom exacerbation, each visit with the study 
physician will entail a detailed side effect evaluation, which will include vital signs and a 
side effect checklist.  The most common side effects of isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70838], 
edema, headache, dizziness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], fatigue, flushing, and constipation. Patients will 
be educated about the potential for hypotension and its symptoms, and blood pressure and 
symptoms will be measured at every visit. If the patient develops clinically significant 
hypotension (e.g., systolic blood pressure equal to or less than 90 mm Hg or diastolic 
equal to or less than 60 mm Hg, or if they experience significant associated symptoms), 
or if at any point in the study subsequent to baseline there is a blood pressure drop of 
20% or more from blood pressure at baseline, they will be discontinued from the study 
medication and excluded from the protocol. Rare side effects have also been reported 
including arrhythmias, syncope, severe hypotension or myocardial infarction. The 
informed consent process will alert subjects to these potential risks and close monitoring 
will ensure prompt response to any adverse effects with appropriate treatment and/or 
study discontinuation, as indicated.   
Additional risks are minimal and involve the completion of questionnaires, interviews 
and paper-pencil/computerized tests. Some of the questions may be distressing to the 
individual and subjects will be told that they may refuse to answer any questions that they 
so choose. The testing procedure can sometimes cause fatigue but we will ensure plenty 
of resting periods during the session and will instruct subjects to notify staff if they would 
like an additional break. Pain and bruising may be associated with the blood draw for 
screening labs; however, a trained phlebotomist will perform the procedure to avoid any 
additional discomfort. 
7) Provisions for Research Related Injury 
In accordance with Federal Regulations, if anyone is injured from being in the study, they 
will receive medical care and treatment as needed from the Mount Sinai Medical Center.  
However, participants are responsible for the costs of such medical treatment, directly or 
through their medical insurance and/or other forms of medical coverage.  No money shall 
be given to them.

Revised  9/2/14 8) Potential Benefits to Subjects 
There may be no immediate potential benefit to the subject from participation in this 
research study; however, the results may provide the bases for larger scale, pi[INVESTIGATOR_70839], lead to novel 
options for treating these disabling symptoms. Moreover, although there is no guarantee, 
it is possible that subjects taking isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_70840]. 
 
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
Subjects are free to refuse to answer any of the questions that are asked of them in the 
study. If the withheld information is critical to study eligibility the patient may not be 
enrolled.  While enrolled in the study, all tests and procedures will be done in a research 
office at ISMMS ensuring privacy. All research staff will be open to answering any 
questions a
nd will address any concerns of the subjects throughout the duration of the 
study.

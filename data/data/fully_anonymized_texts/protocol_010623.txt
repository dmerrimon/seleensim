I. SPECIFIC AIMS (Not to exceed 1 page)  
The potential for incorporating genomic information into a patient’s clinical care for the purpose of improving 
drug therapy; i.e., personalized medicine (or precision medicine), has been anxiously anticipated since the publication of the Human Genome Project and the Hap Map project. The FDA has approved a list of 
pharmacogenomic tests, which can be ordered to guide drug treatment. However, clinical implementation of 
pharmacogenomic (PGX) testing has been disappointing owing to challenges and barriers relat ed to analytical 
uncertainties, misunderstanding of genetic testing among stakeholders and cost. Recently President Obama announced the Precision Medicine Initiative, which include PGX testing, and has earmarked $ [ADDRESS_411405] so that all 
patients including children will benefit. The Nemours Children's Health System is uniquely position to lead the effort to personalize medicine among pediatric patients. This proposal seeks to implement a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof -of- 
concept PGX implementation study in the GI clinic at Nemours Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332686], and proposes to 
begin with PGX testing of the CYP2C19- proton pump inhibitor gene- drug pair. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) 
are one of the most highly prescribed drugs in the world; are extensively used in pediatrics to treat 
gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and other related conditions; and are thought to be safe. All PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332687]2C19, which is expressed in the liver and encoded by [CONTACT_2750]2C19 gene. Loss - and gain- of-function 
SNPs yield poor and extensive metabolizer phenotypes respectively, which result in plasma levels that can vary [ADDRESS_411406] submitted an 
R01 application titled: Pharmacogenetic Approach to Optimizing Proton Pump Inhibitor Treatment in Children, 
which is in response to: PAR 14- 274 Pharmacogenetics, Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_332688] (October 5, 2014 deadline). The PAR recommends that applications include a clinical trial in which we proposed to compare conventional and genotype- guided dosing of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332689]. If funded, 
we will return the unused portion of this application to Nemours Research; if not funded, we will resubmit our 
R01 application using preliminary data gathered from the present project. The primary goal of the present 
project  is to test the feasibility  of a simple,  point -of-care PGX  testing*  service in Nemours  Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
*Point -of-care testing (POCT) is defin ed as medical testing at or near the patient’s bedside, and can be 
accomplished using labor that requires no specialized or professional training. Although the device we 
propose to use (SPARTAN RX) is a POCT device it will be housed in the Division of Pathology at Nemours 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332690]. Therefore, what we propose is technically not 
POCT.  
 
Aim 1: To implement pharmacogenomic (PGX) testing at the Nemours Health System 
 
1a: To determine the feasibility of point -of-care PGX testing the CYP2C19- PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332691] a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332692], Nemours Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Orlando. 
 
1b: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of genoty pe-guided dosing of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332693].  
 
 
II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE (Not to exceed 3 pages)  
Clinical implementation of PGX testing has been disappointing owing to several barriers, which deny patients the benefits of safe and effective drug therapy. In this section we discuss those barriers and demonstrate how

the Nemours Health System is uniquely poised to implement PGX testing. This will benefit Nemours patients 
and their families and will provide a model for other health systems, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332694]. The 
rationale for selecting the CYP2C19-P PI [CONTACT_37425] -drug pair is discussed in this section.  
 
II.1 Barriers to PGX implementation. The incorporation of genetic information into the individual patient’s 
medical record for the purpose of guiding drug treatment in this country is slow owing to challenges and 
barriers including some that are unique to the pediatric population (1- 4). The implementation of PGX testing at 
NHS will benefit Nemours patients and their families by [CONTACT_332757]. Successful implementation of PGX testing at NHS can serve as a model for 
other pediatric health systems, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332695].  
 
The absence of clear guidelines that facil itate timely implementation of PGX into the clinic is a barrier that 
drove the establishment of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) in 2009, by [CONTACT_332758]. One of the goals of CPIC is to provide evidence- based guidelines for 
gene -drug pairs that could be used to improve drug treatment 2. The CPIC has established a framework for 
applying the types and levels of evidence required to justify incorporating genetic information into a patient’s 
medical records to improve drug efficacy and/or reduce toxicity 2. The quality of the evidence linking genetic variation and drug effects can be stratified into 3 levels (and recommendations): level 1: consistent evidence 
from well designed studies (strongly recommended); level 2: sufficient evidence that is limited by [CONTACT_6227], 
quality and consistency of studies, or by [CONTACT_332759] (moderate 
recommendation); level 3: insufficient evidence (optional recommendation)2.  
. 
II.2. Rationale for testing the CYP2C19- PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332696].  
 
II.2.1. PPIs are used extensively for approved and unapproved conditions in pediatrics.  Proton pump 
inhibitors (PPIs) are the most potent and effective class of gastric acid suppressing drugs (5- 8) and are among 
the highest selling prescription (not including over -the-counter sales) drugs in the world (9- 11). More than 75% 
of patients receiving long- term PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332697] (12). PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332698] -term infants for unapproved conditions including gastric acidity, problems feeding, 
esophagitis and gastric pain (13- 16); asthma (17,18) and for food allergies (19 -21). This is of particular 
concern to the FDA (22) because of questions of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332699] (23- 25), and are not 
recommended without evidence of acid- induced disease (22,26). Dosages of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332700].  
 
II.2.2. PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332701]. Chronic use of PPIs has been associated 
with unexpected side effects including gastric and respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], which are thought to be related to the 
gastric acid suppressive properties of PPIs (27,28). The acidic pH of the gastrointestinal tract represents a 
protective barrier from invasion by [CONTACT_332760] (29,30). Chronic gastric acid suppression by [CONTACT_332761] (and 
H2antagonists) reduces the effectiveness of this protective barrier and increases the risk of bacterial 
colonization in the upper gastrointestinal tract (29- 33) (reviewed in:34- 40). Of critical importance, the adverse 
effects associated with PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332702]- dependent. For example, the risks of nosocomcial C difficile infection 
was proportional to the intensity of suppression (no suppressive treatment; H2 antagonists, daily PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332703]/day) among patients receiving gastric acid suppression C difficile infection 32 (see 
Figure 1; in appendix). If aspi[INVESTIGATOR_332704] (41,42). Several studies have reported that the chronic use of PPIs has been associated 
with community -acquired pneumonia in children and adults (34,43- 49). In a study of lansoprazole in infants, 
lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_332705] (25). In a recent study of lansoprazole in children with asthma (ACRC study; PI [INVESTIGATOR_300612]), the prevalence respi[INVESTIGATOR_332706] (17). 

 
  
 
II.2.3. Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332707]2C19 haplotype. The efficacy 
of PPIs is strongly correlated with plasma concentrations (50,51). The pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of most PPIs are influenced by [CONTACT_097]2C19 polymorphisms (reviewed in 52- 55). Several 
loss-of-function alleles reduce drug clearance and increase plasma concentrations of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332708] (PM) or intermediate metabolizers. CYP2C19*1 alleles 
are wild type (WT), and are associated with a more rapid clearance and lower concentrations of PPI, which results in individuals being classified as extensive metabolizers  (EM) (56) 
(http://www.healthanddna.com/2C19tech.pdf).  CYP2C19*17 is a gain- of-function allele that increases the 
clearance of PPIs and decreases drug concentrations even below those observed in individuals classified as 
extensive metabolizers. Individuals carrying *1/*17 alleles contribute to the ultra rapid metabolizer (UM) phenotype (57,58). Individuals with GERD who carry 2 CYP2C19*17 alleles (homozygous ultra rapid metabolizers) require higher doses of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332709] (52,53) (see Table 1 in 
Appendix).  The area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) for omeprazole and lansoprazole 
(and other PPIs) is 3 - to 10- fold higher among poor metabolizers PMs compared to extensive metabolizers 
EMs given equal doses (54,55,59,60). While more studies are needed in children, CYP2C19 variation appears 
to influence PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332710] (58,61,62).  
 
II.2.4. Link between PGX and PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332711]. The link between PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332712]: cure rates for H pylori were significantly higher in PMs compared to EM (52,63). Additionally, high doses of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332713] H pylori (52,59). Thus the quality of the evidenc e linking PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332714]2C19 variation is level 1 and PGX testing 
has been recommended to avoid treatment failures (55). In constrast the evidence linking PGX with PPI - 
associated adverse events is one authored by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_332715] (64). The applicant compared the 
prevalence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_332716] (carriers of CYP2C19*2, *3, *8, *9; N=45) with extensive metabolizers (carriers of 2 WT CYP2C19*1 alleles; N= 91). The OR for upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] i nfections 
(URI) was higher in PM compared to placebo: 2.46 (p<0.05) but not in EM compared to placebo: OR = 1.55 (p=0.15) (See Figure 2 in appendix). Mean ± SD plasma concentrations of lansoprazole were 57% higher in PM compared to EM, thus supporting reduced clearance of and greater exposure to lansoprazole in EM 
compared to PM. (see Figure 3 in appendix). Clearly, the evidence linking CYP2C19 variation and PPI - 
associated respi[INVESTIGATOR_332717] [ADDRESS_411407] that ours is the only published study to demonstrate a link between CYP2C19 variation and PPI [CONTACT_143014]. Notwithstanding the level evidence, we recommend PGX 
testing for the CYP2C19- PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332718]: (i) the 
body of knowledge about the link between PPI -induced acid suppression and dysbiosis and the association 
between PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332719]; (ii) the proportional relationship between PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332720] C difficile infection and between PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332721] -acquired 
pneumonia is unequivocal. Failure to adjust the dose of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332722]. Implementing PGX testing for the CYP2C19- PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332723]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332724]2C19 genotype, which will 
reduce the risk of infection.  
 
III. PRELIMINARY STUDIES /PROGRESS REPORT (Not to exceed 3  pages)  
Preliminary Data. Conventional doses of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332725] a therapeutic 
response in PM. Some children undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy if they fail to respond to PPIs. It is possible that CYP2C19 genetic variation may contribute to poor response to PPI. We 
hypothesized that the frequency  of EM phenotype would differ  in EGD  patients  compared to controls.  First,  we 
genotyped biopsy samples in 29 individuals for the *2, *3, *8, *9 and *17 SNPs and compared them to saliva 
collected from the same individuals to establish congruency between the two samples. 28/29 genotypes were 
congruent; one sample of tissue did not produce a signal. Next we compared the frequencies of genotypes among biopsied samples who were either on or had been on PPI (N=18) and controls (90 adult asthma 
patients) and the results are shown in Figure 2 in appendix. The frequencies of *17 alleles did not differ (0.17 
vs. 0.15) but the frequency of *2 allele was significantly lower in EGD children (shaded bars) vs. control (un- 
shaded bars): 0.028 vs. 0.19 p =0.04. These data are consistent with PMs having a better acid suppressive 

 
  
 
response to PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332726] -dosed with PPI. These data are important to the project because they show that CYP2C19 genetic 
variation influences response to PPI. In addition to tissue we have analyzed (Figure 2), we have received 
tissue from Nemours in JAX, ORL and in Wilmington for children who were on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332727] [ADDRESS_411408] 
cohorts: GERD + pH probe; Cystic Fibrosis; Fundoplication; Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) + C difficile.  
We plan to obtain 100 samples from each cohort to explore our hypothesis in these children.  
 
IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS INCLUDING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS (Not to exceed 10  pages)  
The Nemours Children’s Health System is uniquely positioned to implement PGX testing in pediatrics. We 
propose to initiate this pi[INVESTIGATOR_332728]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332686]. Long- standing and award- 
winning entities operating under the Nemours Health Informatics that continuously evaluates and updates CDS tools, professional educational tools and patient -family education tools is innovative. These programs will 
eliminate several of the barriers to PGX implementation including uncertainties about which test to order, how to act on this genetic information and the uncertainty among patients and their families about genetic testing.  
They will also rapi[INVESTIGATOR_332729]. Some of these programs (listed below) 
will be utilized in the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
IV.1. Nemours Health Informatics: Nemours was among the first institutions to use an electronic health record 
(EHR) (Epic Systems, Verona, WI) in a multispecialty pediatric group practice beginning in [ADDRESS_411409] Review for Every Inpatient and Outpatient Encounter. The initiation of virtually all patient 
encounters  includes  the review  of active  medications  with the patient/family  and Nemours  exceeds  the national 
standard for medication reconciliation. At each visit, digitally created prescriptions (when e prescribing is not 
used) and supportive consumer content are provided at every visit. Prescription pads are not permitted. The accuracy of our medication lists has increased significantly as a result, and therefore the accuracy of clinical 
decision support has also increased.  
 
IV.3. Laboratory Testing: Lab results from external lab sources are digitally interfaced with the medical record 
using the SunQuest Laboratory Information System ( http://www.sunquestinfo.com/products - 
solutions/laboratory/ laboratory/). Test results will be integrated into NemoursOne (EPIC) template that 
provides interpretation and recommendations for dosing or alternative treatments.  
 
IV.4. Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Usage and Outcomes in Place at Nemours;. For over five years, each of 
the Nemours site -specific -physician specialties have identified one or more clinical quality process measures 
that if enhanced, could result in improved outcomes and quality of life. The corresponding metrics are gathered via NemoursOne and results are benchmarked against national standards. Furthering alignment with strategy, 
every clinician has 5% of salary “at risk” for their measured patient outcomes. An assortment of CDS tools are available to clinicians including; “Smart” tools provided by [CONTACT_332762] (templates, forms, lists, phrases); a highly 
customized Epic configuration; library and web resources within the Epic desktop; custom (home grown) 
applications and applets; and commercial CDS solutions. Thus, Nemours has the infrastructure in place to 
develop the CDS tools to be used for PMT and CYP2C19 testing.  
 
IV.5. QlikView for Outcomes Analysis. QlikView is a business discovery tool at Nemours 
(http://home.nemours.net/clinical/ehr/mynemours.html) that integrates data from any source including the 
Nemours Data Warehouse, NemoursOne, external sources, and office programs. The Nemours Data Warehouse is a mission -critical facility that houses extracted data from NemoursOne, secondary Clinical 
Systems, expense cycle systems and other  applications  for reporting in support  of: clinical analysis,  research  

 
  
 
studies, revenue and expense analysis, compliance reporting, performance metrics, risk management and 
infection control, market analysis, patient satisfaction, reporting to external agencies and entities, and other ad - 
hoc areas. With QlikView, clinicians,  administrators, researchers and others can access de- identified 
aggregate data on demand.  
 
IV.6. Nemours University: Nemours University provides online computer based curriculum to all Nemours 
staff and has been the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_332730]! [ADDRESS_411410]. Nemours University will be used to develop online training programs for clinicians who will be ordering pharmacogenomic tests for CYP2C19 testing. Curricula 
can be included as part of required  training and will include general  training on genetics  as well as training  on 
the PGX section that will be newly added to  NemoursOne.  
 
IV.7. KidsHealth: KidsHealth at Nemours creates engaging, family -friendly online, video, and print media fo r 
parents, kids, and teens. KidsHealth’s flagship project, http://kidshealth.org/, is the largest provider of online 
and video content about children’s health and development in the world, and is a resource for fam ilies, 
educators, physicians, and the media. It is the #1, most -visited site devoted to children’s health in English and 
Spanish and on a typi[INVESTIGATOR_132111], KidsHealth gets more than [ADDRESS_411411] low  literacy.  
 
IV.9. MyNemours: MyNemours (https://mynemours.nemours.org/) is a free, confidential, internet -based tool 
that gives parents and legal guardians secure electronic access to select portions of their child’s medical 
records and health history at home. In this proposal, MyNemours will serve several functions: to obtain 
electronic informed consent for genetic testing per the requirements of state laws as well as for storage and 
future use of genomic materials and data, to dessiminate explanations of individual genomic  testing results, 
and to query patient satisfaction with PGX information provided.  
 
IV.10.  Ensuring Consistent Clinical Care Across Nemours  Campuses.  
Nemours Clinical Management Program (NCMP) is an enterprise -wide initiative that focuses on reducing 
unwanted variability in clinical care. To achieve this, NCMP uses principles of evidence- based medicine to 
establish Nemours Standards of Care, creates tools to measure adherence to these standards, and analyzes 
the outcomes of care. By [CONTACT_332763]- tagged clinical data elements, NCMP can measure and model clinical 
outcomes and thus allow quality assessment teams to prospectively monitor care metrics and institute quality improvement initiatives..  
 
IV.11.  Nemours Office of Human Subjects Protection (NOHSP) and Nemours Institutional Review Board 
(IRB): The Nemours Office of Human Subjects Protection (NOHSP) has oversight of institutional policy and 
procedure regarding human subjects protection, including operational oversight of Nemours’ Institutional 
Review  Boards.  
 
In summa ry, the informatics infrastructure that Nemours has in place is well established and highly functional, 
and provides an optimum environment for expanding PGX services in the future. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_332731].

Study design: Our study is an ‘open label’ design in which potential participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_332764]. All potential participants will be children, [ADDRESS_411412] will prescribe PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332734]/her choice (PPIs used at Nemours include lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomerazole and 
pantoprazol). If patients/caregivers agree to participate, they will be asked to read and sign the informed 
consent/assent documents and undergo screening to determine if they meet the inclusion criteria (see below). 
Participants will volunteer to submit a saliva sample for the determination of CYP2C19 genotype and 
metabolizer phenotype.

ordered (Molecular Diagnostic Lab). Consent will also be sought for storing saliva for future PGX testing. 
Patients are not required to provide a sali va sample or to agree to genotype- guided dosing of  PPI. 
3. Saliva sample will be collected; bar -coded; and analyzed by [CONTACT_332765] -of-care system 
housed in Department of Pathology, NCH (CLIA- accredited). Genotype results are available <[ADDRESS_411414] r esults will be integrated into NemoursOne (EPIC); Clinical decision support (CDS) tools will 
provide interpretation and recommendations for PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332742] E prescription will be

Outcome Metrics. Outcomes for evaluating the success of PGX implementation include the following:  
 
% of patients agreeing to volunteer for the study  
% of patients reporting efficacy and toxicity data  
% of prov iders agreeing to participate in study  
% of participants agreeing to future use of DNA  
 
Sub aim 1b: Compare safety and efficacy of genotype- guided for PPI. 
Outcome metrics for response to PPI.  
The primary outcome to assess the efficacy of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332743] a validated 
questionnaire specifically designed for children with GERD (65) (see Figure 6 in appendix). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_332744] (17). Briefly, participants and/or parents and guardians will assess frequency and severity of the following symptoms in the preceding 7 days: Abdominal Belly pain; 
Burpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/Belching; Choking when eating; Difficulty swallowing; Refusal to eat; Vomiting/Regurgitation.  
Participants and/or Parents/guardians will assess severity using a scale for 1 (not at all severe) to 7 (most 
severe). An individual score for each symptom (ISS) will be calculated by [CONTACT_332766] a symptom occurred (frequency) and the severity (1- 7) in the previous 7 days. Composite symptoms 
score (CSS), which defined as the sum of the ISSs, will be calculated. This questionaire will be completed weekly and submitted via REDCap.  

 
  
 
The primary outcome to assess safety (adverse event score) of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332745] a 
questionnaire comprised of 7 respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]: upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (cold); sore throat; strep throat; 
bronchitis; pneumonia; ear infection; acute sinusitis (sinus infection) (See figure 7 in appendix). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_332746](17). The prevalence of each respi[INVESTIGATOR_332747]- driven 
dosing . Additionally, the doses of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332748].  
In addition, each month, parent/legal guardian(s) and/or study participant(s) will briefly answer questions regarding the impact of gastrointestinal and sinus and/or nasal problems on the child’s quality o f life.  
Gastrointestinal problems such as: stomach pain and hurt; stomach upset; food and drinks limits; trouble 
swallowing; heartburn and reflux; gas and bloating; constipation; diarrhea; worry; medicines and 
communication will be measured. On the other hand; sinus infection; nasal obstruction; allergy symptoms; 
emotional distress; activity limitations and overall quality of life are some of the metrics to be evaluated for 
sinus and/or nasal problems. Each metric has its own scoring scale. Gastrointestinal  problems will range from 
0-100 for “Never” to “Almost always”, respectively. Sinus and/or nasal problems have a 1- 7 scale for “None of 
the time” to “All of the time”, respectively.  
Inclusion Criteria. The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_332749]. This is 
important because we expect that the results of our trial to be readily generalizable and that this be implemented in a routine clinical setting. The goal of patient selection is to enroll [ADDRESS_411415] be either currently under a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) therapy or will start a PPI [CONTACT_48831]. Eligible participants must have access  to internet and a valid email adress to comply with weekly study surveys 
to be completed online.  
Exclusion Criteria. This study will exclude children who have had peptic ulcer surgery; with a history of PKU; 
with a history of previous adverse effects from  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_332750] a sensitivity to aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal); 
who are non- adherent including inability or unwillingness of the legal guardian to provide consent or 
unwillingness of the child to provide assent; who are unable to take study medications; who are unable to 
communicate via telephone or other device; who do not have access to a computer with internet access.

reconstruction is Exparel (Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA) . It is a relatively recent bupi[INVESTIGATOR_777701] -vesicular liposomal delivery system that allows slow release of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], resulting in local anesthetic 
effects for up to [ADDRESS_1068075] implant integrity13-14.  
 
Side effects of Exparel primarily includes GI upset (nausea and vomiting) which can occur in greater than 10% 
of pa tients. More rare side effects include hypotension (2 -10%), insomnia (2 -10%), pruritus  (3%), postoperative 
anemia (2 -10%), and muscle spasm (2 -10%).  Similar to other local anesthetics, dose related toxicity can occur 
and can lead to central nervous system excitation or depression.  Exparel has a half -life of 2 4-34 hours and is 
hepatically metabolized and renally excreted . It should be used in caution with patients with moderate -severe 
hepatic  or renal  impairment because of the increased risk of toxicity.  Exparel may increase the toxicity of 
lidocaine and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_777702] 1:2. Furthermore, Exparel may increase the 
effect of neuromuscular blocking agents. Exparel is not recommended in pregnant patients as there have been

These two constructs describe cognitive styles that are strongly inversely associated with each other; MDS will 
provide the optimal weights to best order individuals on this latent scale. Studies have examined the interplay of 
these constructs with other p sychological concepts such as acceptance, pain -related disability and psychosocial 
adjustment and have found that both are reliably associated with the positive and negative aspects of the 
adjustment to pain.                                             
 
The research coordinator will then assign the patients a study number. On the day of surgery, each patient will 
be randomized to be in one of the following two groups for perioperative local anesthetic infiltration:  
 
1. Local infiltration of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  
2. Local i nfiltration of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_777710]. We will enroll our patients in pharmacy randomization program, in which the pharm acy 
will deliver the appropriate medication per assigned group.  
 
To monitor our primary outcomes, patients will be asked to rate their pain level on a visual analog scale  (Table 
2, Appendix Z)  with activity every [ADDRESS_1068093]’s pain scores wi ll 
continue to be recorded every [ADDRESS_1068094] 48 hours after

6.2 Treatment  Administration  
Patients assigned to the local infiltration with b upi[INVESTIGATOR_777713] a total 60 ml of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_665724] [ADDRESS_1068096] . Patients assigned to the local infiltration of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_777714] a total of 20 ml liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (266 mg) with 10 ml of 0.25%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 30 ml  of 0.9% 
sodium chloride . These injections will occur at the end of the mastectomy and prior to the insertion of the tissue 
expander implant. The local anesthetic will be injected into the chest wall and skin flaps. Attending physicians 
and resident physic ians will receive prior instruction regarding correct placement of the local anesthetic so that 
it will be consistently placed in the same locations with similar volume distribution.  After this intraoperative 
injection, patients will not receive any more d oses of local anesthetics.  
6.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
This local anesthetic will get delivered at the time of surgery in an opaque syringe. Standardized anesthetic 
criteria will be applied to all patients enrolled in th e study. Pre -operatively, all patients will receive multi -modal 
therapy,  such as  acetaminophen , celecoxib , and gabapentin or pregabalin  unless  contraindicated. 
Intraoperatively, patients will only receive short acting fentanyl for analgesia. Intraoperative  ketamine and 
dexamethasone will be avoided.  A notification will populate in EPIC once the patient is linked to the study in 
WISER to notify the anesthesia provider.  Postoperative non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_777715].   
 
 
Patients will  receive full supportive care  as medically necessary , including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc . Medications considered necessary for the patient's well -being may be 
given as long as they are considered safe in the postoperative period and clinically indicated. The reason(s) for 
treatment, dosag e, and dates of treatment will  be recorded on the flow sheets .

Protocol version date 08/28/17        Page 15 of 44 7.4 STRC  SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
The Safety and Toxicity Reporting Committee (STRC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs for WFBCCC  
Institutional studies as outlined in Appendix B. STRC  currently requires that all unexpected 4 and  all 
grade  5 SAEs on these trials be reported to them for revi ew. All WFBCCC  Clinical Research 
Management (CRM) s taff members assisting a P rincipal Investigator  in investigating, documenting and 
reporting an SAE qualifying for STRC  reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the 
STRC as well as the e ntire committee via the email notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE. 
All adverse events will be recorded and the data will be managed in WISER. As such, the STRC will 
have access to all adverse events in the course of the study.  
7.5 WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events shall be promptly 
reported to the IRB , according to institutional policy . Reporting to the IRB is required regardless of the 
funding source, study s ponsor, or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, 
biologic or device. Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but include psychological, 
economic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result of drugs, biol ogical agents, devices, 
procedures or other interventions, or as a result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other 
interactions with research subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the IRB and other 
applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others. The Principal 
Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated 
problems involving risk to subjects or others to the IRB. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_600912] a change in the risks and/or benefits to study particip ants, and 
whether any changes in the informed consent, protocol or other study -related documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a site where the study has 
been approved by [CONTACT_399338] (interna l events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 
calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at another site conducting th e 
same study that has been approved by [CONTACT_399338] (external events) must be reported to the 
WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming 
aware of the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outcome  that alters the risk versus potential benefit of the research 
and as a result warrants a substantive change in the research protocol or informed consent 
process/document in order to insure the safety, rights or welfare of research subjects.

Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) 
SAEs on WFBCCC  Institutional interventional trial patients . There are multiple en tities that 
require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and how it is 
reported.  
 
Rules used by [CONTACT_485230] (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, etc.) 
should NOT be used to evaluate whether an event s hould be reported to STRC. Only the rules for 
reporting described in this document should be considered.  
 
As defined in the NCI Data Table 4 reporting guidelines, WFBCCC  Institutional 
Interventional studies covered by [CONTACT_777740]: In-house, 
internally reviewed trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry 
sponsorship in which the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, 
and monitoring of the trial, or participation in a multi -site trial initiated by [CONTACT_672054].   Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher 
here at WFBCCC . Institutional protocols are labeled NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the 
protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but 
Research Base trials are classified as Institutional.  
 
The STRC  is responsible for review ing SAEs for WFBCCC  Institutional Interventional studies, 
as defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on 
these trials be reported to the STRC for review. All Clinical Protocol and Data Management 
(CPDM) staff memb ers assisting a PI [INVESTIGATOR_777735] a clinical member of the STRC by [CONTACT_648] (or in -
person), followed by [CONTACT_399350].  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any faculty or staff member on the 
study team for a WFBCCC  Institutional Interventional trial. Once an event is observed, it 
is the responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it is reported.  
 
What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure?  
Any unexpected grade 4  event and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) 
should be reported. These events should be reported if they occur while a patient is on study

should be reported.

STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
1. Make a phone call (or speak in person) to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as 
listed below (page if necessary) —see note [ADDRESS_1068138] knowledge of the event. 
This form is found at either the ORIS main menu page or by [CONTACT_399351]://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the event (i.e., study team 
membe rs and STRC members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of your 
confirmation. (Form instructions will walk you through the required fields, consult the help 
page for further instructions.)  
3. Ensure that you document that the appropriate person(s) on t he STRC has been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
This documentation is placed on the STRC Notification form described above.  
4. Follow up with/update the clinical member(s) of STRC regarding any new developments or 
information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting process.

Definition of Unavailable:   
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_777741] a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact [CONTACT_399354].  Give the back -
up a reasonable amount of time to respond to a phone ca ll or page before contact[CONTACT_777742]. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a clinical research 
professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is 
appropriate to contact [CONTACT_777743] p clinicians.  If the event occurs near the end of day, then leave 
messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC notification 
form.  The important criteria is that you have taken reasonable steps to notify and document that  
you have initiated some type of contact [CONTACT_672057].  
 
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events as 
they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the 
members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the information reported; there

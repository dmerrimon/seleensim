 3.0 STUDY SYNOPSIS   
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the VisAbility  Implant 
System (VIS) for the improvement of near visual acuity in presby [CONTACT_35577].  This is a 
prospective clinical study that will enroll and determine eligible a total of [ADDRESS_593342] randomized controlled sub-study at 3 investigational sites. 
Subjects enrolled and eligible at these sites will be randomized (1:1 ratio)  to a surgery group or a 
control group. Subjects randomized to the surgery group will undergo surgery and will be followed 
for 24 months in the s ame manner as the larger non -randomized surgical group. Subjects 
randomized to th e control group will be followed for 6 months , and will be eligible to undergo 
surgery  after completion of this 6 -month follow -up period .   
The primary endpoint is achievement  of distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) of Snellen 
equivalent 20/40 or better (at 40 cm)  and at least 10 letters (ETDRS) improvement in DCNVA  in 
the primary eye.  
This endpoint will be evaluated against two objectives, a ) 75% or more of  primary e yes achieve 
the effectiveness endpoint at 12 months postoperative and b) the percentage of primary eyes 
achieving the effectiveness endpoint at 6 months postoperative (6-month responder rate) is higher 
than the percentage in the randomized  contro l group.   
A PMA  application will be submitted when the full study cohort has completed the 12 month follow -
up visit.

 4.0 BACKGROU ND AND REGUALORY CHRONOLOGY  
4.1 Background  
Clinical evaluation of PresVIEW Scleral Implants (PS I) was initiated in [ADDRESS_593343] been evaluated.  
 
The PSI model PSI -001 was implanted in 164 subjects  (213 eyes)  from 1999 through 2007.  The 
PSI model SGP -046 was introduced in 2009 to provide better fixation of the PSI in the scleral 
tunne l.  Since there were significant differences in the design of the PSI models PSI -001 and 
SGP -046, a full cohort of 330 subjects (645 eyes) was implanted with the SGP -[ADDRESS_593344] of four segments which are implanted 
in scleral tunnels in the four oblique quadrants of the eye. From 1999 through 2000, scleral tunnels 
were created using a diamond blade.  An automated, electricall y powered, re -usable device 
designed specifically for scleral tunnel crea tion, called the Scleratome, was introduced in 2003 
and this incision system was used through mid -2012.  In April 2012, FDA approved introduction 
of a smaller, lighter, disposable Scleratome into the ongoing IDE clinical trial.   Since the tunnel 
configurat ion was the same for both Scleratomes, as demonstrated in performance testing 
submitted in the IDE supplement supporting introduction of the disposable Scleratome, Refocus 
assumed tha t clinical data from both the re -usable and the disposable Scleratome w ere expected 
to be comparable.  
 
After  introduction of the disposable Scleratome in May 2012, 56 subjects (119 eyes) were  
implanted  in incisions made with this improved S cleratome .  An exploratory analysis of 12 month 
clinical outcomes of these eyes as compar ed to eyes implanted with the earlier reusable 
Scleratome provide d evidence  of greater improvements in near vision with the disposable 
Scleratome.  While this finding was unanticipated, it was also very encouraging since the se 
improvements in near vision w ere achieved considerably earlier in the postoperative period . 
This finding was also important since it confirmed Refocus’ expectation that improved surgical 
instrumen tation would have a favorable effect  on postoperative clinical outcomes, as evidenced 
in the transition from the original IDE pi[INVESTIGATOR_463226] a 
diamond blade to use of the automated, re -usable Scleratome introduced i n 2003 and to the more 
recent introduction of the disposable Scleratome.  
 
In Protocol P -277-5, conducted under G970152, the location of the scleral incisions for placement 
of the PSI was identified by [CONTACT_463289]. This me thod was not 
completely reliable since the marking can be difficult for the surgeon to se e during the procedure. 
As a result, some surgeons ha d experienced difficulty  placing the Scleratome in the proper 
position relative to the marks created.

 4.2  Rational e for Protocol VIS -2014  
In a further effort to develop improved surgical instrument ation that would provide more reliable 
placement of the scleral tunnels creat ed by [CONTACT_463290], the company has developed an 
integrated surgical instrumentation system, called the VisAbility  Implant System.  
The VisAbility  Implant System consists of  the:  
• VisAbility  Implant (previously referred to as the PSI model SGP -046), 
• VIS Docking Station  (previously referred to as the Oculock)  
• VIS Scleratome (the Docking and Scleratome together, previously called the  
“Oculock Incision System”)  
• Other custom surgical  instrument s for use during the procedure .  
The Docking Station is a fixation device that addresses sources of variability in the creation of 
scleral tunnels and provides a simple method for placing the Scleratome in the correct location 
on the eye . The Do cking Statio n provides stabilization of the eye and serves to “dock” the 
Scleratome  during creation of the scleral tunnels , ensuring consistent placement of the [ADDRESS_593345] prevalent of all visual deficiencies, affecting virtually 100% of the 
population over the course of a normal life span. It is characterized by a progressive, age -related 
loss of accommodation, or the ability of the human eye to focus clearly on objects over a range 
of near to intermediate dist ances from the eye.  By [CONTACT_463291], the amplitude of 
accommodation has dec lined so that the near point of the eye is more remote than typi[INVESTIGATOR_463227].  Once presby[CONTACT_463292], emmetrop es will need an optical aid for near vision .  Myopes 
will find they see better at near without their distance correction and hyperop es will require  a 
correction  for both distance and near vision.  
When the eye accommodate s to focus on a near object, converge nce and pupil constriction also 
occur .  The com bination of these three movements (accommodation, convergence and miosis) is 
under the c ontrol of the Edinger -Westphal nucleus and is referred to as the near triad, or 
accommodation reflex.  Accommodation is accomplished by [CONTACT_463293], depending on the distance of the object fr om the eye.   In the 
eye of a presby[CONTACT_463294], the lens cannot accommodate sufficiently to focus the light rays 
from a near object onto a single point on the retin a. Thus, a point object is imaged as a blur circle 
on the retina. Loss of accommodation typi[INVESTIGATOR_463228] -life, eventually culminating in a 
nearly complete loss of the ability of the eye to clearly visualize near objects.     
Currently, no universall y accepted surgical treatments are available for presby[CONTACT_19555].  Vision 
correction options include near vision reading glasses and/or contact [CONTACT_13276]. As the physiological 
mechanisms of accommodation are investigated, more therapeutic and corrective options ar e 
being explored.  These include the use of multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs), monovi sion and 
anisometropic corneal refractive surgical procedures using laser -assisted in situ keratomileusis 
(LASIK), corneal implant devices, and the VisAbility  Implant.  
5.1 Lenticular and Extralenticular Theories  
The underlying cause(s) of presby[CONTACT_19555], loss of accommodation of the eye over time, is not 
completely understood or agreed upon by [CONTACT_47044].   Scientific t heories for 
accommodative loss may be generall y ascribed  to two schools of thought:  
• Lenticular Theories  are broadly based on age -related changes in properties of the lens of 
the eye, including the lens substance, the lens capsule, and the zonular fibers. These 
theories stem not only from purported changes in the elasticity of the tissues, but also from 
continued growth and changes in the  thickness and the curvature of the lens with age.  
Helmholtz’s lenticular theory of the loss of accommodation is the most widely accepted of 
these types o f theories.1 The majority of current approaches for the treatment of 
presby[CONTACT_463295].  
 
• Extralenticular Theories  consider age -related changes in the accommodative structures 
outside of the lens, capsule, and zo nules. These factors include anatomical, 
morphological, and physiological changes in the ciliary musc le, connective tissue, and 
choroid.  The Scleral Implant approach to the treatment of presby[CONTACT_463296].  
  
PROTOCOL VIS -[ADDRESS_593346] 150 years, Helmholtz's lenticular theory of the loss of accommodation has be en the 
accepted basis for the underlying physiological mechanisms that lead to presby[CONTACT_19555]1  Helmholtz 
hypothesized that presby[CONTACT_463297].  According to 
Helmholtz, as the ciliary body contracts for accommodation, it  constricts inwardly  and relax es the 
zonules .  The relaxation of the zonules causes the lens to "round up", and as the lens becomes 
more conv ex, it adds dioptric  power thus bringing near objects into focus.  According to 
Helmholtz’s theory, the decrease in  flexibility of the lens and the loss in elasticity of the lens 
capsule that occur with aging progressively hinder the focusing mechanism.   
Although generally accepted, Helmholtz’s theory cannot fully explain the mechanism by [CONTACT_463298], nor can it satisfactorily explain the reason or means by [CONTACT_463299].   
An extralen ticular theory that may explain age -related changes in accommodation is [CONTACT_463392]’s catenary theory of ac commodation.2,3,4  Coleman’s theory proposes that the lens, 
zonules, and anterior vitreous comprise a diaphragm between the anterior and vitr eous chambers 
of the eye.  According to Coleman, this construct behaves in a manner analogous to a hydraulic 
suspen sion bridge, or catenary .  When the ciliary muscles contract to accommodate the lens, 
pressure is increased in the vitreous compartment . 
Simu ltaneously, pressure in the anterior chamber is decreased due to the expansion of the 
trabecular meshwork, which oc curs with ciliary body contraction.  A pressure gradient is thus 
established between the 2 chambers, resulting in a posterior flattening of t he lens and, anteriorly, 
in a steeper radius of curvature in the center of the lens with a slight flattening at the  peripher y.6 
The anterior capsule and the zonules form a hammock -shaped surface (a modified catenary) that 
can be predicted mathematically based on the circumference of the ciliary body (Müeller’s 
muscle).7  Much like the pylons of a suspension bridge, the  ciliary body dictates the shape of the 
catenary.  Thus, the accommodated state appears to be supported by [CONTACT_463300], much like a viscose -damped hydraulic door closer.  
Coleman’s hypothesis has been te sted by [CONTACT_23992] a mechanical model of accommodation with 
in vivo  measurements of lens geometry changes during accommodatio n (measurements included 
ultrasound, MRI, and optical techniques).,6,7,[ADDRESS_593347]. Goldberg notes that, “ A team 
of European investigators (Elke Lutjen -Drecoll, MD, and colleagues at the Institute of Anatomy in 
Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]) and American investigators (Mary Ann Croft, MS; Paul Kaufman, MD; and 
colleagues at the National Primate Lab and University of Wisconsin in M adison) have used 
electron mic roscopy and video ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and endoscopy to define the 
complex, separate elements of the zonules and document the interconnected movements of the 
extralenticular tissues. ”  [CONTACT_463393] suggests that the mechanism of accommodation sho uld 
include a new theory of reciprocal zonular action, which he describes as follows: “ During ciliary 
body contraction, the anterior zonules lose tension while the posterior zonules stretch.  During 
ciliary body relaxation, th e posterior zonules lose tensi on as the lens flattens and is pulled back 
by [CONTACT_463301] .”     
The exact cause of the loss of accommodation over time is not known and may be associated 
with the above theories, a combinatio n of these theories, or theori es not yet introduced.

 6.0 PRIOR SCLERAL IMPLANT CLINICAL STUDIES  
As briefly described in the introduction to this protocol, Refocus  has conducted a feasibility study 
of the scleral implant s in 29 presby[CONTACT_463302], followed by a pi[INVESTIGATOR_463229] 135 
subjects  with the PSI-001 design of the PresVIEW Scleral Implant and 330 subjects with the SGP -
046 design . The results of th ese studies are described briefly below.  
6.1 Feasibility Clinical Study  
Clinical evaluation of the scleral implants was initiated in March 1999 following FDA approval of 
G970152.  The feasibility clinical trial enrolled 29 presby[CONTACT_463303] 6 clinical sites . Subjec ts were implanted in the primary eye only and followed 
for 24 months. Four PMMA segments were implanted in partial thickness scleral tunnels in the 
four oblique quadrants of the eye. The scleral tunn els were made using a diamond blade.   
While s ome study subjects experienced a clinically significant improvement in near visual acuity  
in this study, the effectiveness results were mixed as a result of difficulty in accurately and 
consistently creating th e scleral tunnels. Notwithstanding these challenges, the initial results 
provided evidence of safety and effectiveness and supported initiation of a larger clinical trial.  
Importantly, the findings regarding difficulty in scleral tunnel creation led to development of an 
automated, electrically powered, re -usabl e incision device, the Scleratome, which was used in 
subsequent clinical studies.   
6.2 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_463230]-001 Scleral Implant  (Protocol P -277-5) 
A prospective, randomized control led multicenter clinical trial of the PSI-001 scleral implant  was 
appro ved by [CONTACT_463304] 2003 .  Subjects were implanted with the PSI-001 and followed for 
24 months.  In the initial r andomized  controlled stage  of this study , 150 subjects were to be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio either to a surgical cohort (N=100) or to a Deferred Treatment / C ontrol 
cohort (N=50) with an interim report to be provided to FDA upon obtained preliminary data o n 75 
randomized subjects.  Subjects randomized to the deferred surgery/control cohort were eligible 
to receive the implant after completion of 6 mon ths of follow -up in the study.  
In the initial stage of this study, a  total of 81 subjects were enrolled and randomized to either the 
PSI Treatment Group (53) or the Deferred Treatment Control Group  (28) at a ratio of 2:1 per the 
study protocol. At  the 3 -month visit, 64% (23/36) of the eyes assigned to the PSI Treatment Group 
had distance corrected n ear visual acuity 20/40 or better, as compared with 6% (1/18) of Deferred 
Treatment Control Group.  At the 6 -month postoperative exam 70% (30/43) of the  eyes in the PSI 
Treatment Group eyes had distance corrected near visual acuity 20/40 or better, as comp ared 
with 4% (1/23) of the Deferred Treatment Control eyes.    
While t hese data supported expansion to the full study cohort of [ADDRESS_593348] (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, [LOCATION_013]) revealed displacement of 
at least one of the implant segments  in subjects who experienced an initial improvement in n ear 
vision followed by [CONTACT_463305] .  
Subsequent ly, in a group of patients with displaced segments , repositioning and suturing of the 
segments was associated  with clear improvements in near acuity, and confirmed that the stability 
of the PSI-001 segments in the scleral tunnel was directl y related to clinical efficacy.  
Since suturing of the PSI-001 significantly  increased procedure time and complexity,  Refocus 
deferred further enrollment in the study pending design changes to the scleral impla nt segment 
to resolve the displacement issue.  A new design was developed, which incorporat ed a two part 
implant segment ; a main body with “feet” at both ends that protrude d beyond the edges of the 
tunnel  and a secondary locking insert . This design , known as the PSI model SGP -046, was 
introduced into Protocol P -277-5, and has been shown to reliably maintain the implant segment 
firmly in place , as described further below.  
6.3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_463231] -046 Scleral Implant ( continuation of Protocol P-277-5) 
The PSI model SGP -046, designed to provide better fixation of the PSI in the scleral tunnel , was 
introduced into Protocol P -277-5 in June 2009 . Since 135 subjects had already been enrolled and 
implanted with the PSI-001 design, enrollment was incr eased to 465 subjects to ensure that 330 
subjects could be enrolled and implanted with the PSI SGP -046 in support of a Premarket 
Approval Application  (PMA) .  
With the modified design o f the PSI segment, another 48 patients were to be enrolled in a sub -
study and randomized (2:1 ratio) with 32 patients receiving the PSI SGP -046 and 16 deferred 
surgery/control patients. As before, subjects randomized to the deferred surgery/control cohort 
were eligible to receive the PSI after completion of [ADDRESS_593349] PSI surger y after completion of 6 months of follow -up in the 
deferred /control  surgery  group were included in the total pat ient cohort.  
A smaller, lighter, disposable Scleratome was also introduced into the ongoing IDE clinical trial  in 
April 2012 .  Since the tunnel configuration was the same for both Scleratomes, as demonstrated 
in performance testing, Refocus assumed that cli nical data from both the re -usable and the 
disposable Scleratome would be comparable.  However, an exploratory analysis of 12 month 
clinical out comes  for 56 primary eyes (119 total eyes) implanted with PSI using the disposable 
Scleratome  showed greater impr ovements in near vision following surgery with th is improved 
surgical tool  as compared to earlier subjects in the cohort .  While this finding was unanticipated, 
it was also very encouraging since the improvements in near vision were also achieved 
considera bly earlier in the postoperative follow -up period . These finding s were important since 
they confirmed Refocus’ expectation that improved surgical instrumentation would have a 
favorable impact on the post -operative clinical outcomes, as evidenced in the tra nsition from the 
original IDE pi[INVESTIGATOR_463232] a diamond blade to use of the 
automated, re -usable Scleratome introduced in 2003 and to th is more recent introduction  of the 
disposable Scleratome.

 A total of 645 eyes  of 330 subjects were enrolled and implanted with the PSI SGP -046 in this 
clinical study. Subjects implanted with the PSI SGP -046 experienced clinically meaningful 
improvement with DCNVA (Sloan) at 40cm.  DCNVA (Sloan) of 20/40 or better was achieved by 
80% (237/298) of subjects at 12 months, by 84%  (210/249)  of subjects at 18 months and by 91%  
(120/132)  of subjects at 24 months . 
Further, during the course of this clinical trial no persistent loss in BCDVA or BCNVA was 
observed in any eye.  BCDVA remained g enerally unchanged from baseline through the 24 month 
visit and all (100%) of the PSI treated eyes achieved BCNVA of 20/32 or better at all postoperative 
examinations.  
The PSI model SGP -046 has not been modified since its introduction into the clinical tr ial 
conducted under G970152, and there are no plans to  modify this model of the PSI.  
Frequently reported ocular adverse events in this clinical trial were dry eye and improper 
conjunctival closure after the surgical procedure , the latter resulting in expo sed implant  segments.  
Exposed segments  were treated with revised conjunctival closures.  Other ocular adverse events  
included conjunctival tags, corneal abrasion s, conjunctival injection, superficial punctuate keratitis 
(SPK), conjunctival thinning, and e xposed suture.  All of these were trans ient in nature and 
resolved without sequelae , generally with no or limited medical intervention . IOP increase s 
secondary to postoperative administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_463233]; in all cases, IOP 
return ed to the baseline level after disconti nuation of the steroid drops  and/or short -term use of  
IOP lowering medications in a few cases .  
Three ( 3) cases of decreased iris vascular perfusion resulting in decreased pupil reactivity to light , 
and iris atrophy were reported  in the complete cohort of 858 eyes of  this IDE study  for an incidence  
of 0.35% .  This adverse event has been  mitigated with a high level of standardization of the 
immediate post -operative surgical protocol to ensure detect ion of any adverse ch ange in pupil 
function where recovery falls below minimum standards .  In those rare cases,  the implant 
segments  will be removed on the day of surgery prior to discharge, thereby [CONTACT_463306] . All prior cases achieving a  measured pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463234] ≥ 
25% constriction by [CONTACT_463307][INVESTIGATOR_463235] [ADDRESS_593350]  they develop ed any further 
signs or symptoms  of decreased  perfusio n.  Therefore, this protocol will require removal of implant 
segments  on the day of surgery in the rare circumstance that the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463236] .   
In summary, adverse events were observed  in the original IDE study  but these were generally 
mild in nature, self -limiting and largely resolved by 6 months postoperatively. The majority of the 
adverse events occurred during the early postoperative period , with no serious or significa nt 
adverse events o bserved  in the late postoperative period, i.e., at 6 months or later.

7.1 Study Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the VisAbility  
Implant System with the VisAbility  Implant, model SGP -046, for improvement in distance 
corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) in presby[CONTACT_463302].   
7.2 Stud y Design  
This is a prospective  multicenter  clinical study that will enroll and determine eligible 360 subjects 
ranging in ag e between 45 and 60 years of age  with distance corrected near visual acuity

be enrolled at up to 1 4 clinical sites  with no site enrolling and determining eligi ble more than 20% 
of the [ADDRESS_593351] -operatively. The fellow ey e will be 
examined at one day, one week and one month postoperatively. The one week and one month 
examinations of the fellow eye may be combined with visits for the primary eye if the visit windows 
perm it. After the fellow eye one month visit, the fellow e ye will be examined  in accordance  with 
the subsequent primary eye examination visits. A validated Patient Reported Outcome 
Measurement instrument  (the NAVQ ) will be given to all enrolled and eligible subjects pre -
operatively and at 6, 12, [ADDRESS_593352] randomized controlled sub-study at 3 investigational sites. 
Eligible subjects enrolled at these sites will be randomized (1:1 ratio)  to a surgery group or a 
contro l group. Subjects assigned to t he randomized surgery group will be implanted and followed 
for [ADDRESS_593353] surgery will be followed for 24 months  in accordance with the same schedule as the 
non-randomized surgery group .  Randomized  control group subjects who do not chose to  under go 
VisAbility  Implant surgery at the end of the 6 month observation period  will be exited from the 
study at that time.  
7.3 Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is  achievement of distance corrected near visual  acuity (DCNVA) of Snellen 
equivalent 20/40 or better (at 40 cm)  and at least 10 letters (ETDRS) improvement in DCNVA  in 
the primary eye.  
 
This endpoint will be evaluated against two objectives, a) 75% or more o f primary eyes achieve 
the effectiveness end point at 12 months postoperative and, b) the percentage of primary eyes 
achieving the effectiveness endpoint at 6 months postoperative (6-month responder rate) is higher 
than the percentage in the randomized  control group.

8.3 Surgical Procedure  
The VisAbility Implant System surgical procedure will be performed by [CONTACT_463311] 2: VisAbility Implant System Surgical 
Procedure. The surgical procedure involves the fo llowing basic steps:  
 
• Marking  – To indicate the correct rotational position of the VIS Docking Station,  
two or more drops of xylocaine 2% sterile solution without epi[INVESTIGATOR_463240] 12: 00 and 
6:00 limbus along the axis of the center of the superior and inferior recti muscle 
insertions.  Additional marking from these two points with the VIS Barrel Marker 
further aids in VIS Docking Station positioning by [CONTACT_463312] x/y centering and rotational placement of the VIS Docking 
Station.  
 
• Peritomy  – Additional xylocaine 2% sterile solution without epi[INVESTIGATOR_463241]’s space for anesthesia. Opening of 
the conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule at the limbus by [CONTACT_463313], glaucoma, or retina surgery is done to 
provide exposure of the sclera in the area of VIS Docking station fixation points 
and scleral tunnels.  Due to the potential detrimental effect on perfusion and 
scleral thickness, bipolar and or thermal  cautery should not be used during  this 
procedure .   
 
• Placement of the VIS Docking Station  – The VIS Docking Station uses  a four point 
fixation system to provide ocular fixation and a fixed docking location for the VIS 
Scleratome.  The VIS Docking Station is centered around the limbus with its 
internal arrow points on the 6:00 and 12:00 marks and the channels line d up with 
the four radial lines from the VIS  Barrel Marker.   Each of the four VIS Docking 
Station’s fixation points are then actuated [ADDRESS_593361] any deficiency prior to 
proceeding .   
 
• Scleral Tunnel Creation  – The V IS Scleratome l ocating r idge is docked to the VIS 
Docking Station channel with the blade guard flush with its corresponding edge.  After  
the footplate is squarely on the sclera, the VIS Scleratome is activated to form each of 
four scleral tunnels at a fixe d position appr oximately 4mm from the limbus and 
centered between adjacent recti muscles.  USE OF A MANUAL LAMELLAR BLADE 
IS NOT ALLOWED FOR USE IN CREATING OR AUGMENTING ANY SCLERAL  
TUNNEL . To minimize manipulation of the eye, a VisAbility Implant  Segment should 
be place d in each Lamellar Scleral Tunnel made prior to proceeding to the creation of 
the next Lamellar Scleral tunnel.  
 
  
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 19  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 • Implantation of the VisAbility Implant  – Pre-operatively, The VisAbility Implant  Main 
Body is loaded into the VIS Feeder Tube to close the le ading stabilization feet and 
facilitate their placement thru the scleral tunnel.  The VIS Feeder Tube is guided by 
[CONTACT_463314].  After the leading stabili zation feet 
fully traverse and exit the scleral tunnel it is disinserted from the VisAbility Implant  Main 
Body.  With the VisAbility Implant  Main Body in this position, the VIS Center Insert is 
clasped to lock into place, creating a uniform, smooth and sta ble VisAbility Implant  
Segment in each of the four oblique qu adrants. If for any reason, only one or two 
Scleral Tunnels can be implanted with VisAbility Implant  Segments, these segments 
will be removed from the eye.  
 
• VIS Docking Station Removal  – The VIS  Docking Station fixation is detached at 
each of its four poi nts of fixation with 180 degree counterclockwise reverse 
actuation to the stop and it is removed in a careful manner to avoid corneal 
abrasion . 
 
• Conjunctival Closure  – Assess all VisAbility Impla nts for position .  Should 
hemostasis be required, Evicel fibr in sealant (Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd., Kiryat 
Ono, Israel ) or TISSEEL  fibrin sealant (Baxter International, Inc ., Deerfield, IL) may be 
used.   The conjunctiva is brought up to cover the VisAbility Implant s and re -
approximated to the perilimbal area wi th 9-[ADDRESS_593362] a smooth, minimally wrinkled or 
bunched closure to the li mbus that fully covers the VisAbility Implant s. 
 
• After Conjunctival Closure  – At the completion of the surg ery, a removable 
punctual plug should be placed in the inferior punctum and an initial dose of 
antibiotic drops such as moxifloxacin ophthalmic solut ion or equivalent and steroid 
drops such as prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic suspension or equivalent 
should be instilled in the eye.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_593363] -Operative Care  
Following surgery, physicians should adhere to the following guidelines of topi[INVESTIGATOR_463242]:  
 
• To help control pain postoperatively, an icepack should be applied to the eye  at 
intervals  for approximately 30 minutes or longer as needed.  A topi[INVESTIGATOR_15385] -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as nepafenac ophthal mic suspension or 
equivalent may also be instilled immediately postoperatively.  Chilled BSS may be 
instilled every 1 5 minutes and topi[INVESTIGATOR_463243] 
1% ophthalmic suspension or equivalent may be used every 15 to 30 minutes until 
the pupil reaction is greater than 25% as described in the next step.  Prior to discharge 
the patient should be given Diamox 500mg Sequel PO or equivalent.  
 
  
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 20  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 • Pupil functionality will be evaluated postoperatively using a NeurOptics Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463244] [ADDRESS_593364] 25%.  A 
second, confirmatory reading may be  taken as soon as [ADDRESS_593365].  If two 
pupil constriction reading s of at 25% or greater are not achieved within the first [ADDRESS_593366]  remove  all four implant  segments no later than 6 hours after the 
surgery  if two pupil constriction readings of 25% or greater are not achieved within 6 
hours postoperatively .  
 
• During the first week after the surgery, antibiotic drops such as moxifloxacin 
ophthalmic solution or equivalent and a topi[INVESTIGATOR_463245]. Additionally, NSAIDs such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_463246] / or oral medications such as 
naproxen or equivalent or ac etaminophen with codeine or equivalent may be given as 
needed for pain during this time.  
 
• Absorbable and / or non -absorbable conjunc tival sutures may be removed at one week 
post-operatively or later as needed.

 9.0 INVESTIGATIONAL MATERIALS  
The investigational materials provided for the clinical study of the VisAbili ty™ Implant System 
include the following:  
• VisAbility  Implant  
• VisAbility  Incision System : 
• VIS Scleratome  
• VIS Docking Station  
• VIS Feeder Tube and VIS Shuttle  
• VIS Instrument Set  
9.1 VisAbility  Implant  Segment  
The VisAbility  Implant is a curved scleral implan t segment that is injection molded from 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), a material with an extensive history of long -term implantation in 
the human eye, including intraocular lenses (IOLs).  Four (4) V isAbility  Implant segments are 
placed in a single presby [CONTACT_463319].  
Each VisAbility Implant  segment consists of 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], a main body with 2 legs and a center insert. 
The center insert has trans -longitudinal grooves on both sides that correspond to 2 small “rails” 
on the interior edges of t he legs of the main body ( Figure 1 ). These features allo w the insert to 
be smoothly snapped into place in the main body. The design of the VisAbility Implant  segments 
includes stabilization feet at each end intended to fixate at the entrance and exit sides  of the 
scleral tunnel incision, thereby [CONTACT_463320]. The VisAbility Implant  segments are provided sterile in a Tyvek® 
peel pouch.

9.2 VisAbility  Incision System  
The VisAbility  Incision System consists of the specialized surgical instruments provided to creat e 
precisely positioned scleral tunnels:  
• VIS Scleratome  
• VIS Docking Station  
9.2.1  VIS Scleratome  
The VIS Scleratome ( Figure 3 ) is a custom designed disposable Scleratome used to create 
the scleral tunnel incisions into which the VisAbility Implant s segments  are placed.  The VIS 
Scleratome is designed to create consistent scleral tunnel incisions for implantation of the 
VisAbilit y Implant  segments. Ultrasound imaging is performed as part of the patient screening 
examination to confirm that the thickness of th e sclera in the region of placement of the 
VisAbility Implant  segments  satisfies the requirements for making the scleral inc isions. The 
VIS Scleratome  is provided sterile in a disposable plastic tray with a Tyvek® cover and is for 
single patient use only.  
 
FIGURE 3: VIS SCLERATOME  
9.2.2  VIS Docking Station  
The VIS Docking Station ( Figure s 4A and 4B) is a template made of titanium and medical 
grade stainless steel that is temporarily fixated on the eye centered around  the geometric 
corneal limbus to provide  a guide for placement of the VIS Scleratome .   The VIS Scleratome 
docks with the VIS Docking S tation to provide a consistent location for the scleral tunnel 
incisions ( Figure s 5A and 5B).

 When the VIS Docking Station is placed on the eye, a point on the VIS Docking Station is 
positioned to align with the 6:00 and 12:00 o’clock hour mark s on the patient’s limbus  
(Figure 4 ) corresponding to the radial center of the inferior and superior recti muscles . The 
surgeon is then able to verify that the VIS Scleratome docking channels in the oblique 
quadrants are properly located between the rectus muscles.  The VIS Docking Station is then 
temporarily fixated to the eye with [ADDRESS_593375] pi[INVESTIGATOR_103483] . The VIS Scleratome is 
then docked, 1 quadrant at a time, into each of the channels located at the 1:30, 4:30, 7:30, 
and 10:30 clock positions of the VIS Docking Station. The VIS Scleratome is docked using 
the “locating ridge” on the blade guard of the Scleratome  (see Figure 5).   
Actuate the Scleratome by [CONTACT_463321]. After 
placing the VIS Scleratome in position on the sclera usin g the VIS Docking Station, the 
actuator button on the Scleratome  handle is p ressed, releasing and retracting the blade and 
creating the scleral tunnel. The Scleratome  is then reloaded for the next actuation by [CONTACT_463322].  
The VIS Docking Station is a re -usable instrument that can be sterilized by [CONTACT_463323].  It is provided in a plastic case along w ith the other re -usable surgical instruments.  
Directions for cleaning and autoclave steri lization of the VIS Docking Station and the other re -
usable surgical instruments are provided to the surgeon . 
9.[ADDRESS_593376] been formed, the VisAbility Implant  segments are inserted using 
the VIS Feeder Tube and VIS Shuttle.  The VIS Feeder Tube is made of PTFE (Teflon), a 
commonly used medical grade polymer.  The soft, lubricious and flexible PTFE tubing provides 
the optimal means of traversing the lamellar scleral tunnel with the least amount of externa l stress 
on surrounding tissue.  Each VisAbility Implant  main body can be loaded into a VIS Feeder Tube 
by [CONTACT_463324] t’s sterile workspace to the surgeon 
for implantation.   
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 28  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 The VIS Shuttle is a titanium in strument consisting of 2 sections: a trailing section, cylindrical in 
shape, which is inserted into the tubing of the VIS Feeder Tube, and a leading section that 
tapers from the tubing outer diameter down to a dull round tip to facilitate positioning into the 
scleral tunnel.   
The VIS Shuttle is inserted into the larger end of the VIS Feeder Tube.  The main body of the 
VisAbility Implant  segment is compressed into the other end.   The VIS Shuttle is then passed 
through the scleral tunnel, pulling with it th e VIS Feeder Tube with the compressed main body of 
the VisAbility Implant  segment.  As the tube exits the tunnel, the trailing stabilization feet on the 
legs of the i mplant catch the entrance of the tunnel and hold it in place as the tubing is removed, 
and the forward locking stabilization feet open to engage the exit incision.  Final assembly of the 
implant follows, as the center insert is positioned and snapped into place creating a single 
VisAbility Implant  segment.  Figure [ADDRESS_593377] the 
VisAbility Implant  segments in the scleral tunnel.

 10.0 ADVERSE EVENT R EPORTING  
An Adverse Event (“AE”) is any untoward sign, symptom or disease observed during the course 
of the study regardless of the suspected cause.  Conditi ons or diseases that are pre-existing or 
chronic but stable are not Adverse Events .  Changes in pre-existing or chronic condition s or 
disease s that are consistent with natural disease progression are not Adverse Events.   
10.1 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
An A dverse Event should be classified as a S erious Adverse Event (“SAE”) and reported as such, 
if it meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• It results in death (i.e., the A dverse Event actually causes or leads to death) . 
 
• It is life threatening (i.e. , the A dverse Event places the subject at immediate risk of death) . 
 
• It is considered sight -threatening (i.e., the A dverse Event involves loss of vision at the time 
of diagnosis and carries a relatively grave prognosis of irrevocable loss of vision withou t 
timely high risk intervention ). 
 
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (i.e., the A dverse Event requires  at least a 
24-hour inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205271] d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137406] ) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_463248] . 
 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the A dverse Event results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to c onduct normal life functions) . 
 
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed 
to the investigational product . 
 
• It does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require m edical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an A dverse 
Event, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be recorded as 
the event. (For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15428], record 
the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_6476] ). 
Investi gators must notify Refocus of any SAE within [ADDRESS_593379] all case details that can be gathered 
within 48 hours on the SAE Form and fax immediately upon completion to Refocus . 
10.2 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse dev ice effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life -threatening or sight -threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree 
of incidence. UADEs also include any unanticipated sig ht-threatening events and any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, s afety, or welfare 
of subjects.  
PROTOCOL VIS -[ADDRESS_593380]’s condition is stable. The 
investigator will take appropriate and necessary therapeutic measures required for resolution of 
the Adverse Event. Any medication necessary for the treatment of an Adverse Event must be 
recorded on the concomitant medication source document .  
All AEs will be character ized by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Event term  
• Intensity or severity  
• Expectedness  
• Relationship to stu dy treatment  
• Outcome  
• Treatment or action taken.  
Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used when recording AEs. Colloquialisms 
and/or abbreviations should not be used. Only one medical concept, preferably a diagnosis instead 
of individual sy mptoms, s hould be recorded as the event.  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) should be r ecorded on 
the source document  rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record congestive heart 
failure rather than dyspn ea, rales, and cyanosis). If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms 
cannot be characterized with a single medical diagnosis or syndrome and they are considered 
unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease at the time of reporting, these individual eve nts 
should be recorded as separate AE s (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe headache are 
observed at the sa me time, each event should each be recorded as an individual AE). If a 
diagnosis was not initially reported, and is subsequently established  it should be reported as 
follow -up information  and the original AE documents updated accordingly . 
Adverse Events oc curring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_443077]; a "primary" event, if clearly identifiable, sh ould represent the most accurate clinical 
term to record as the AE event term.  For example:  
Orthostatic hypotension    fainting and fall to floor   head trauma   neck pain  
The primary event is orthostatic hypotension  and the sequelae are head trauma and n eck pain.  
 
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 32  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 10.4 Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_141471]  / Severity  
All Adverse Events should be graded on a four-point scale (mild, moderate, marked, severe) for 
intensity/severity. These definitions are as follows:  
Mild: Transient discomfort; no med ical intervention/therapy required and does not 
interfere with daily activities.  
Moderate:  Low level of discomfor t or concern  with mild to moderate limitation in daily 
activities; some assistance may be needed; minimal or no medical intervention/therapy 
required.  
Marked: Considerable discomfort with limitation in daily activities, some assistance 
usually required; me dical intervention/therapy usually required.  
Severe: Extreme discomfort and limitation in daily activities, significant assistance 
required; significant  medical intervention/therapy required.  
There is a distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an Adverse Event. Severity is 
a measurement of intensity; thus  a severe reaction is not necessarily a Serious Adverse Event. 
For example, a  headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be serious unless it met one 
of the criteria for Serious Adverse E vents.  
10.5 Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_463328] / Relatedness  
All AEs will be evaluated as to whether they are expected or un expected, as defined below:  
Expected (anticipated):  An Adverse Event is expected when the nature, severity, or 
degree of incide nce was previously described.   
Unexpected (unanticipated): An Adverse Event is unexpected when the nature, severity, 
or degree of incidence  was not previously described.  
    All AEs will be evaluated as to whether they are related to the device , as defined below:  
Not Related : Strong evidence exists that the Adverse Event definitely has a cause other 
than the investigational devic e (e.g. pre -existing condition or underlying disease, 
concurrent  illness, or concomitant medication), or the investigational device cannot be 
implicated based on the available information  
Possibly Related : There is a temporal association with the investig ational device and 
it cannot be excluded as a cause but other etiologies are also likely to be the cause based 
upon available information  
 
Probably Related : There is a temporal association wit h the investigational device 
which makes a causal relationship p robable where other etiologies are possible but 
unlikely to be the cause, based upon available information.  
Definitely Related : Strong evidence exists that the investigational device definitel y 
caused the Adverse Event.   There is a temporal relationship be tween the event onset and 
the investigational device and the subject’s clinical state and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_463249] -2014   Page 33  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 been ruled out as a cause, based upon available information.  
10.6 Adverse Event Outcome  
The clinical outcome of an A dverse Event will be recorded and characterized as follows:  
• Resolved without sequelae  
• Resolved with sequelae (specify)  
• Ongoing (i.e. continuing at time of study discontinuation)  
• Death.  
10.7 Treatment or Action Taken  
The clinical treatment of an A dverse Event will be documented a nd characterized as follows:  
• None  
• Medical Intervention  
• Surgical Intervention  
• Other  
10.[ADDRESS_593381] -operative follow -up visit 
schedule  (i.e., 3 months means the 3 month  postoperative visit) .  Exams for the primary eye and 
fellow eye may be done at the same visit if windows permit.   For purpose of determining 
whether a fellow eye event is an Adverse Event, the time period used shall be based on the date 
of the fellow eye surgery.  
    
These specific examples of anticipated A dverse Events include, but are not limited to:  
 
 Intraoperative Events  
• Scleral perforation  
• Scleral perfora tion with vitreous prolapse  
Lids and Lashes

 11.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This is a prospective, multicenter study with a randomized, controlled sub -study that is designed 
to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of  the scleral implant procedure. The percentage of 
primary eyes achieving the effectiveness endpoint will be evaluat ed at 12 months postoperatively.  
Within the study cohort, a subgroup will be randomized on a 1:[ADDRESS_593382] cohort.  
This randomized controlled sub -study will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the s cleral 
implant procedure in the randomized surgery group compared to effectiveness in the randomized  
control group at 6 months postoperativel y. 
 
The effectiveness endpoint, hypotheses, sample size calculations, analysis population, handling 
of missing data , analysis methods, and analysis of safety data are as follows.  
 
11.1 Effectiveness Endpoint  
The effectiveness endpoint is:  
 
Achievement of d istance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) of Snellen equivalent 20/40 
or better (at 40 cm)  and at least 10 letters (ETDRS) improvement in DCNVA  in the primary 
eye.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_593383] be met.  
 
Objective #1:  
The scleral implant procedure is defined as successful if 75% or more of primary eyes 
achieve the effectiveness endpoint at 12 months postoperative. The corresponding 
statistical hypothesis is as follows:  
 
H0 (null hypothesis):   p < 0.75  
Ha (alternative hypothesis):  p  0.75 
Where, p is the probability that subjects achieve the effectiveness endpoint at 12 
months postoperative  (12-month responder rate) . 
 
Objective #2:  
An analysis of the randomized surgery group and randomize d control grou p will be 
conducted.  The randomized  surgery group is defined as successful if the percentage of 
primary eyes achieving the effectiveness endpoint at 6 months postoperative (6-month 
responder rate) is higher than the percentage in the randomized  control gr oup.  The 
corresponding null and alt ernative hypotheses are as follows:  
 
H0 (null hypothesis):   p1 ≤  p 2   
Ha (alternative hypothesis) :  p1 > p 2  
Where:  
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 36  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 ▪ p1 is the percentage of primary eyes in the randomized  surgery group 
who achieve the  effectiveness en dpoint at  6 months.  
▪ p2 is the percentage of primary eyes in the randomized  control group 
who achieve the effectiveness endpoint at [ADDRESS_593384]’s dominant eye and the eye that will undergo 
surgery first.  It is inten ded that all subjects w ill also undergo surgery in the fellow eye at 
a subsequent date as specified in the protocol.  
 
11.3  Sample Sizes  
Both Objective #1 and #2 will need to be statistically significant in order to determine the 
effectiveness of the stud y device.  Therefore th e two -sided significance level of 0.05 is not 
adjusted for the multiplicity.  
 
Full Study Cohort Effectiveness Endpoint  
The sample size calculation for the statistical hypotheses described for Objective #1 in Section 
11.2 is based on  the following criteria:  
 
• The two -sided significance level = 0.05 (or one -sided significance level = 0.025).  
• The statistical power = 90% at p = 0.825.  The assumption of true responder rate 
of 0.825 is based on the simple average of success rate observed i n previous 
Refo cus clinical study data, as follows:  
• Disposable Scleratome group had an observed success rate of 88%.  
• Re-usable Scleratome group had an observed success rate of 77%.  
• Simple average of 88% and 77% is 82.5%.  
• Binomial distribution is used for s ample size calculation.  
Based on the criteria above for Objective #1, 330 treated primary eyes should be available 
for analysis at 12 months. If a dropout rate of 10% of subjects by [ADDRESS_593385] an Adverse Event (AE) with a true probability of 
occurrence among subjects of 1% with 95% probability, based on the binomial distribution, 
a sample of at least 299 eyes would be requi red (in accordance with ANSI Z80 29 
18Nov2013 AIOL [rev 20]).  Assuming a drop -out rate of approximately 10% of subjects by 
12 months, the surgery cohort should include a minimum of 333 treated primary eyes.  
 
A sample size of 3 33 treated primary eyes will m eet the sample size requirements for both 
safety and ef fectiveness. The study cohort is planned for 360 surgery subjects at up to 14 
study sites.  However, n o site may enroll and determine to be eligible more than 20% of 
the subject surgery cohort.  
  
Rando mized Sub -study  
The sample size for Objective #2 in Section 11.2 is based on the following criteria:  
 
• The two -sided significance level = 0.05 (or one -sided significance level = 0.025).  
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 37  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 • Based on the randomized control group data collected in IDE G970152, th e 6-
month responder rate is estimated as 10% for the  control group.  
• Based on the surgery group data collected in IDE G970152, the 6 -month 
responder rate was lower than the 12 -month responder rate.  Therefore, it is 
assumed that the 6 -month responder rate o f the randomized surgery group in this 
study will be  approximately 0.75.   
• The statistical power = 90%.  
• Fisher’s exact test is used for sample size calculation.  
 
Based on the criteria above, a sample of 1 4 randomized surgery group primary eyes and 
14 rando mized control group primary eyes at 6 months will en sure a power greater than 
90% for Objective #2, using a one -sided alpha of 0.025.   
 
A sample size of 30 randomized surgery group subjects and 30 randomized control group 
subjects has been selected which will account for a possible 10% subject drop -out rat e 
and allow for greater accuracy in point estimates for both groups.  This randomized sub -
study will be conducted at 3 clinical sites.  Sites will be chosen based on availability of 
equipment for addition al sub -study measures, such as availability of an iT race unit (Tracey 
Technologies, Houston, TX), and the ability and willingness of the site to participate in the 
additional sub -study.  The target enrollment at each of the [ADDRESS_593386] signed the full informed consent but do not meet all  of the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria wi ll be considered enrolled but ineligible for the study.   The reason for the 
disqualification will be recorded and reported.   
  
Safety Cohort: All eyes (both primary and fellow eyes) that have undergone surgical pr eparation 
of the ocular surface.  
 
Effective ness Cohort:  All primary eyes that have been implanted with at least one implant 
segment and primary eyes of subjects that have been enrolled and determined eligible in the 
randomized control group.   
 
Figure 9, below, summarizes the status of enrolled subjects and the cohort populations for the 
study, except that the randomized control group is not shown.

FIGURE 9 – ILLUSTRATION OF STUDY POPULATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
  

PROTOCOL VIS -[ADDRESS_593387] Accountability  
 
The following terms and definitions will be used for the accountability of the study population and are 
based on the definitions found in ANSI Z80.29 Rev 018, section B.5.3 as modified and explained 
below.  
• Enrolled – the total number of subjects that have  signed the full informed consent.  
• Enrolled but ineligible – the total number of subjects that have signed the full 
informed consent but do NOT  meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
• Enrolled and eligible – the total number of subjects that hav e sig ned the full 
informed consent and meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Surgical Withdrawal – Subjects (eyes) that have been enrolled and determined  eligible but 
do not undergo surgical preparation of the ocular surface for any reason.  
 
• Discontinue d– Subjects (eyes) that have discontinued treatment prior to the visit window 
associated with the form as a result of death, the removal of all 4 implant segments 
(explant), or any other reason except lost to follow -up.  
• Explanted Eye – Eyes tha t underwent  implantation surgery, but have had all 
implanted segments removed.   
 
• Lost to Follow -up – Subjects that have withdrawn from the study after initial eye surgery or 
subjects that have missed the visit window associated with the form and all subsequent 
sched uled visits despi[INVESTIGATOR_463250] -up.  
 
• Missed Visit – Data for subjects  (primary eyes) that is not available for a follow -up visit 
within the specified visit window associated with the form , but data is available for a 
subsequent follow -up visit for such subject .   
 
11.6 Analysis of Effectiveness Cohorts  
For the primary analysis of Objective #1, all observed 12 -month data of the surgical primary eyes 
will be included in the effectiveness analysis.    Missing data will not be imputed except that 
explanted primary eyes will be imputed as failures.  
 
For the primary analysis of Objective #2, all reported 6 -month data of the randomized primary 
eyes will be included in the analysis.  Missing data will be imputed as follows:  
 
• Randomized Control Group:  In the abs ence of [ADDRESS_593388] to follow -up and missed visit rate could be 
higher and since no intervention occurs during the 6 month period, this imputation of 
missing data is warranted.  In the absence of an y observed data between the 3 month visit 
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 40  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 and 6 month visi t, this missing data will not be imputed since  failure  to achieve the 
effectiveness endpoint is expected.  
• Randomized Surgery Group:   
• Explanted primary eye s will be imputed as failures.  
• In the abse nce of [ADDRESS_593389] 
refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), cycloplegic refraction spherical equivalent (CRSE), wi ll 
be reported for each subject.  Baseline characteristics such as age, sex, race, and near visual 
acuity will be summarized . 
 
11.8 Analysis of Effectiveness Data  
As noted previously, both Objective #1 and Objective #[ADDRESS_593390] be satisfied in order for the study to be considered a success.  
 
 Analysis of Objectiv e #1:  
The one -sided 97.5% lower confidence limit of the 12-month responder  rate will be 
calculated based on the exact binomial distribution.  This goal is met if the one -sided 
97.5% lower confidence limit of the 12-month responder  rate is at least 75%.  
 
The per centage of primary eyes achieving the Effectiveness Endpoint at 12 months will 
be compared among the study sites.  The Fisher’s exact test will be used to evaluate the 
possible study site effect. If the site effect is significant, i.e., p -value ≤ 0. 15, the n  
12-month responder  rates stratified by [CONTACT_463329] 12-month responder  rates will be calculated. The normal distribution approximation 
will be used to  estimate the one -sided lower 97.5% confidence limit for the  average  
12-month responder  rate. 
 
Fisher’s exact test will also be used to assess the effects of subject sex, race and age 
category at surgery on the 12-month responder  rates for primary eyes us ing a p -value of 
0.15.  For this analysis, age will be categorized into 3 interval groups (i.e., 45 -49, 50 -54, 
and 55 -60).   
  
 Analysis of Objective #2:  
The number and percentage of primary eyes achieving the Effectiveness Endpoi nt at  
6 months will be su mmarized for the randomized surgery group and randomized control 
group separately.  The two -sided Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare the difference 
between 6-month responder  rates of the two randomized groups.   
 
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 41  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 In order  to assess potential diffe rences of randomized group allocation and/or site  
6-month responder  rates, a logistic regression analysis examining with the following will 
be performed:  
 
• treatment effect (the randomized surgery group and the randomized control  
group at that same site),   
• study site effect (site by [CONTACT_463330]), and  
• site by [CONTACT_463331] a significant difference (p  ≤ 0.15) in treatment effect, study site effect, or a 
significant interaction effect between stu dy site effect and treatme nt effect (p  ≤ 0.15), then 
the 6-month responder  rate for each study group and the difference in the 6-month 
responder rate  between the two randomized groups (p treatment  - pdeferred ) will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_129583].  
  
Sensitivity Analysis of Objectiv e #1:  
Sensitivity analysis will be performed for Objective #1 using the following imputation 
methods for missing 12 -month data:  
 
• Best Case Analysis: All discontinued primary eyes will be imputed as effectiveness 
failures. F or primary eyes lost to follow -up or for primary eyes missing [ADDRESS_593391] value from any protocol scheduled visit at 1 month or later (1 month, 3 
month or 6 month visit) will be used . If such visit data does not exist for a primary eye, 
the effectiveness will be imputed  as a success.    
    
• Worst Case Analysis: All discontinued primary eyes will be imputed as effectiveness 
failures.  For primary eyes lost to follow -up or missing [ADDRESS_593392] 
value from any protocol schedu led visit at 1 month or later (1  month, 3 month or 6 
month visit) will be used.  If such visit data does not exist for a primary eye, the 
effectiveness will be imputed as a failure.    
 
• Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_47863]:  All discontinued primary eyes will be imputed  as effectiveness 
failures.  For  primary eyes missing 12 -month visit data for reasons other than 
discontinued, effectiveness will be initially be set to success.  At this step, the lower 
limit of the one -sided 97.5% confidence intervals (CI) will be calcul ated.  Serial 
calculations will then be performed using a decreasing number (i.e., n -1, n-2, …1) of 
successes to determine the maximum number of additional failures allowed for the 
lower bound one -sided  97.5% CI of the effectiveness endpoint percent estim ate to 
achieve or exceed 75% suc cess.   
 
Sensitivity Analysis of Objective #2:  
• Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_47863]:  All discontinued primary eyes will be iteratively imputed as 
effectiveness success or failures.   Let n 1 and n 2 be the number of discontinued primary 
eyes for the randomized surgery gr oup and the randomized control group, 
respectively.   For the n 1 discontinued randomized surgery group primary eyes, they 
can be imputed as 0 failures, 1 failure, 2 failures, and up to  n1 failures, for a total of 
(n1+1) possible imputations.  For the n 2 discontinued randomized control group primary 
eyes, there are (n 2+1) possible imputations.   Therefore, there are (n 1+1) × (n 2+1) 
possible combinations of success and failure imputations for these discontinued 
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 42  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 primary eyes.   For each of these possible imputati ons, the lower limit of the one -sided 
97.5% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated.   The imputations that have the lower 
one-sided 97.5% CI < 75% will be identified.    
11.9 Analysis of Safety Data  
Safety data such as BCDVA, slit lamp findings, and f undus findings will be summarized 
descriptively (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous outcomes, and 
counts and percentages for categorical outcomes) for primary and all eyes.  
 
For IOP at each visit, the mean, standard deviation, mi nimum and maximum  and change from 
baseline  will be summarized for all implanted eyes.   Additionally, number and percentage of eyes 
with a IOP change from baseline of “decrease > 10 mmHg”, “decrease ³ 5 mmHg to ≤ 10 mmHg”, 
“change within ± 4 mmHg”, “increas e³ 5 mmHg to ≤ 10 mmHg”, and “increase > 10 mmHg” will 
be prepared for each study visits.  
 
Manifest spherical equivalence (MRSE) will be summarized descriptively with the 95% 
confidence interval for the mean for primary eyes and all eyes at each visit.  Additionally, the 
same analyses will be performed on the MRSE adjusted by [CONTACT_463332] (i.e. , minus 0.082 D 
per year1,2,3,4). 
 
11.[ADDRESS_593393] deviations, and ranges will be derived from the continuous measurements; 
numbers and percentages will be used for summarizing the categorical outcomes.  No specific 
claims will be made based on outcomes not pre -specified as an endpoint and no p-values will be 
presented for analyses without a pre -specified hypothesis.  
 
11.11 Analysis of Patient Reported Outcomes (NAVQ)   
The NAVQ instrument will be scored using Rasch analyses consistent with the analytic framework 
used during development.  An interval score for near visual function will be produced for each 
participant at each assessment.  This score will plotted against b inocular DCNVA and correlations 
explored.  
 
The pre - and post -surgery comparison will be made using data from the 12 month visit and p aired 
t-tests.  The NAVQ score will also be evaluated across visits, with adjustments for correlated data 
within patients b eing assessed on multiple occasions using Generalized Estimating Equations.  
 
There is an option of ‘Not applicable’ within the respo nse categories and these responses will be 
scored as 0.  This is necessary as not all study subjects may engage in the acti vity described and 
may therefore be unable to comment on their vision during the named activity.  Rasch analyses 
can still be complet ed with missing data, although some precision in the estimate of the score for

statistics only. The difference between the baseline and 12 month NAVQ scores will be calculated 
for each pa rticipant to determine if there is a measurable improvement in subjective report of near 
visual function.   Correlations be tween the change in near visual function (NAVQ score) and 
overall satisfaction (0=completely satisfied; 4= completely unsatisfied) an d changes in objective 
measures of monocular and binocular DCNVA will be investigated using correlation coefficients 
in linear regression models.  It is hypothesized that there would be a moderate positive correlation 
between DCNVA and NAVQ score based on previous associations found between this instrument 
and visual acuity5.  
  
The stability of any improvement in near visual function (NAVQ score) will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_463334] -operative follow -up visits (6, 12, 18 and 2 4 
months) using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models.   
 
Responses to the NAVQ questions will be used to develop a n initial raw score based on the scale 
shown on the NAVQ. The NAVQ was developed using the Rasch model and is recommended to 
be score d using item response theory. [1]  As the NAVQ will be administered before and after 
surgery,  all response data will be scored using the Andrich Rating Scale model for polytomous 
data in WinSteps (Version 3.80.1 Chicago, IL).  Interval scores will be produced for each 
participant based on  their responses to the [ADDRESS_593395] Surg, 2012. 38(1): p. 74 -9

 APPENDIX 1: EXAMINATION METHODS  
Refractions and acuity measurem ents shall be obtained by [CONTACT_4674], optometrist or 
trained technician (who is superv ised directly by [CONTACT_463336]).   
Manifest Refraction  
Manifest refraction will be performed pre and post -operatively using ETDRS acuity charts and 
standard phoropters. All systems will employ actual or equivalent optical distances of at least 4 
meters (13 feet) and ambient lighting will be adjusted based on chart specifications.  Chart 
luminance will fall within the ANSI required ra nge of 80 -160cd/m2 and chart contrast will be a 
minimum of 85%.  
Cycloplegic Refraction  
Cycloplegic refrac tion will be performed ~ 20 minutes after application of 1 drop of tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% 
at select pre and post -operative visits using the same systems as for  manifest refraction.  
Instrument for Measuring Visual Acuities  
All visual acuities will be measured via t he OPTEC 6500 (Stereo Optical, [ADDRESS_593400]., 
Suite 502, Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003] [PHONE_9698] or [PHONE_9699] ).  This system utilizes a lens  
system to simulate various test distances for distance, intermediate and near.   The Optec 6500 
has a mi croprocessor controlled internal illumination system that results in constant luminance of 
85cd/m2; therefore, normal ambient lighting may be used as l ighting conditions are not a factor in 
the testing set up.  The manufacturer’s instructions for use will be provided to each Investigational 
site. 
Distance Visual Acuity  
Distance visual acuity will be measured at a simulated (optical) distance of 20 feet.     
Intermediate Visual Acuity  
Intermediate visual acuity will be measured at a simulated (optical) dist ance of 66cm.      
Near Visual Acuity  
Near visual acuity will be measured at a simulated (ocular) distance of 40cm.  
Determination of Near Add  
The add power will be determined by [CONTACT_463337], using the Optec [ADDRESS_593401] will be advised to perform the following steps for determination of the dominant eye.  
 
1. Hold your hands at ar m's length out in front of you.  Your palms should be pointing forward - 
in other words, you should be looking  at the backs of your hands.  
2. Make a "triangle. " Extend both of your thumbs so that they're roughly perpendicular to the 
rest of the hand. Overlap your hands so that the space between makes a triangle. Your two 
[ADDRESS_593402]  that's small enough (or far enough away) that you can see the whole object 
through the viewing window between your hands. This can be anything - a door knob, a 
coffee mug, or even a letter on a faraway billbo ard. 
 
5. Focus on the object.  Try to focus your ey es on the object between your hands - not your 
hands themselves. Your hands should become somewhat blurry, while the object remains 
clear and in -focus. It's important to line this object up directly in front o f you and to stare 
straight at it - turning you r head to either side can distort your results.  
 
6. For best results, at this point, make minor adjustments to your hands so that the object 
you're looking at fits almost exactly within the edges your viewing win dow. In other words, if 
your triangle is bigger  than the object you're looking at, move your hands together to make 
it smaller, and vice versa.  
 
7. Alternate closing each eye to see which gives better vision.  Close one eye, then open it and 
close the other. E ach time you switch eyes, the object you're loo king at should do one of 
two things. It should either become obscured behind one of your hands  or remain visible. 
Next, try your other eye. Your dominant eye is the one that allows you to see the object 
while it remains open.  
 
Scleral Thickness Measurement  
Scleral thickness will be measured and printed using the Sonomed Ultrasonic Biomicroscope 
(UBM). The manufacturer’s instructions for use will be provided to each Investigational site.

distance (PRD) which will be recorded  in centimeters a nd diopters. Three wavefront scans will be 
captured at each target distance.  
Each of the wavefront scans will be analyzed by [CONTACT_463338] (version 5.3.1) for the following 
parameters:   6 
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 52  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 1. Refraction (sphere and cylinder) over a calcul ated 4 mm entry p upil,  
2. Zernike polynomials up to the eighth order,  
3. RMS of higher order aberrations (HOA)  
4. Total depth of focus (DoF).  
Defocus Curves  
Defocus curve testing will be performed to subjectively measure the effectiveness of presby[CONTACT_463339].  Testing will be performed using phoropter with a 
computer -controlled LCD distance chart with ETDRS letters at 6m/20ft.  The phoropter will contain 
the subject’s best manifest distance refraction.  
A range of lens powers from  -4.00 D to +2.[ADDRESS_593403] distance refraction for 
this testing. The lens power in the phoropter will be progressively reduced in +0.50 D steps, starting 
at -4.00 D and moving towards +2.00 D.  After each lens power change, the letters should be  
changed to a new set of letters of the same size or smaller and the letters read per line should be 
recorded.  The testing should proceed as follows:  
1. The subject should be seated and looking through a phoropter with the contralateral eye 
occlude d. 
 
2. The c omputer -controlled ETDRS letter chart should be used at a 6 m/20ft distance from 
the patient.  
 
3. The patient's best distance correction should be dialed in to the phoropter.  
 
4. With the patient viewing the smallest letters corresponding to the patien ts BCDVA,  a –
4.00D lens should be added to the patient’s distance correction.  (If the subject cannot 
read any of the letters, the letter size should be increased by 1 line until the acuity can 
be measured.)  As the letters are read, the correct letters sh ould be c ircled and the visual 
acuity should be recorded with the corresponding lens power.  To prevent memorization, 
the letters should be changed to a new set of letters between each lens change and 
reading attempt.  
 
**If the patient reads all the letter s on the line correctly, then switch to the next smallest 
line of letters and instruct that patient "Can you read any letters on this next smallest 
line?" If the patient again reads all letters correctly, repeat until either some or all letters 
in the next  smallest  line are missed.  Once the subject has missed letters, do not proceed 
to the next line and only record the letters that the subject got correct. (If 5 letters on the 
line are read plus 2 letters on the next line down, the total is 7 letters). In addition,  record 
the corresponding acuity for the previous line, where the all the letters were read 
correctly.

APPENDIX 2: VISABILITY IMPLANT SYSTE M SURGICAL PROCEDURE  
The VisAbility Implant System surgical procedure is performed as an outpatient procedure by 
[CONTACT_463340].  
1. Marking  
Approximately ten minutes prior to  the procedure, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l anesthetic such as proparacaine 
ophthalmic solution or equivalent is instilled in the eye(s).  With the patient in the standing or seated 
position and fixating on an object straight ahead, mark the limbus at 12:00 and 6:00 o’clock  with a 
sterile gentian violet marker.  Reinforce these marks as needed and place on drop of Brimonidine 
0.1% or 0.15% or equivalent on the patient’s operative eye.  Have the patient close their eyes for 
two minutes.  
In the operating room, with the patient ’s vital signs monitored , use systemic relaxation as needed 
(e.g. Valium, Fentanyl, and/or Versed).  
Clean the eye and the skin around the eye in the usual manner for sterile intraocular surgery and 
drape the patient and their lids and lashes from the surgical field.  
Use a locking  eyelid speculum that will hold the eyelids widely open.  
Instill sterile 2% xylocaine drops without epi[INVESTIGATOR_463254], drying off any excess.  
Positively identify the superior and inferior rectus muscle insert ions and the anterior ciliary arteries 
accompanying them such as by [CONTACT_463341] a flat spatula or the flat handle of a 
forceps or other alternative method.  Confirm that the previously placed 6:00 and 12:00 o ’clock 
limbal marks correspon d to the axis of the center of the respective rectus muscle insertion or correct 
their position to this axis as needed.  
On a relatively dry limbus, align the positioning barrel to the geometric limbus and rotate it to align 
the internal grooves with previo usly placed limbal marks.  Place the barrel marker in its positioning 
slits and mark the eye.  
2. Peritomy  
Re-instill sterile 2% xylocaine drops without epi[INVESTIGATOR_463255].  
Make two 3 mm or longer vertical conjunc tival incisions approximately 0.5mm from the limbus at 3 
and 9 o’clock using a 0.[ADDRESS_593404] posteriorly 
into sub -Tenon’s space at an ang le to avoid the horizontal plane of the medial and lateral recti 
muscles.  
 1 
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 55  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 With a blunt cannula on a syringe containing sterile 2% xylocaine solution without epi[INVESTIGATOR_463256], enter the sub -Tenon’s space posteriorly.  Advance the cannula and then  sweep the 
cannula toward the limbus. Inject about 0.25 cc of the sterile 2% xylocaine solution without 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_463257] 4 quadrants.  
After the sub -Tenon’s injection of anesthetic has been c ompleted, perform a 360 degree limbal 
peritomy of the conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule.  
Upon completion of the peritomy inspect the sclera at 3, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock for bare sclera in 
preparation for placement of the VIS Docking Station. Utilize an absorben t stick, forceps if additional 
blunt disse ction of the sclera is required.  
CAUTION:  
If after completing the conjunctival peritomy, the surgeon observes the insertions of the rectus 
muscles nearer than 4.5mm posterior to the limbus, aborting the procedure a nd closing the 
conjunctiva must be conside red. This is done to avoid the risk of impi[INVESTIGATOR_463258], thus decreasing the risk of Anterior Segment Ischemia.  
CAUTION:  
Due to the potential of a detrimental effect on perfusion and / or scleral thickness, bipo lar 
and / or thermal cautery should not be used during surgery.  
 
 3. VIS Docking Station Placement  
Place the VIS Docking Station on the eye by [CONTACT_463342]. Carefully drape 
the conjunctiva over the four corners and perimeter of the VIS Docking Station to avoid engaging 
any conjunctiva in the helical twists.  
Center the VIS Docking Station on the geometric limbus by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_463259]. Maintain the desired rotational position by [CONTACT_463343] 6 and 12 o’clock 
internal arrow points on the unit with the 6 and 12 o’clock limbal marks and the docking channels 
on the unit with the oblique line marks fro m the VIS Barrel Marker.  
Once concentricity and rotational position have been satisfactori ly achieved, use the VIS Actuation 
Tool to rotate each of the four fixation points clockwise 180˚ to the stop while pressing down on the 
VIS Docking Station to engage  the helical twists into the limbal sclera.  
After fixation, visually confirm satisfactory x/y and rotational positioning and verify sufficient four 
point fixation of the VIS Docking Station by [CONTACT_463344]. 
Reposition if necessary.  
  
[ADDRESS_593405] on the eye:  
1. Inferior Nasal   (IN) 
2. Superior Nasal  (SN) 
3. Inferior Temporal  (IT)  
4. Superior Temporal  (ST)  
Beginning with the inferior nasal quadrant, rotate and proptose the eye to provide adequate 
exposure of the sclera. Confirm the sclera near the VIS Docking Station is bare. Perform additional 
blunt dissection if required.  
Prior to placing the VIS Sclerato me, verify the winding knob h as been fully actuated.  
Dock the VIS Scleratome locating ridge to the corresponding channel in the VIS Docking Station 
and line up the blade guard with the surrounding edge.  While maintaining this docked position, 
bring the VI S Scleratome perpendicular to  the sclera such that the footplate is flat to bare sclera.  
With a balance of pressure with the VIS Scleratome and proptosis with the VIS Docking Station, 
activate the VIS Scleratome by [CONTACT_463345] e. 
Confirm the length of each  lamellar scleral tunnel created using the VIS Spatula.  
CAUTION:  
When advancing the VIS Spatula thru the scleral tunnel, the leading tip must be directed 
outwards (anteriorly) along the roof of the tunnel to facilitate exiting from the tunnel and to avoid 
unintentional scleral perforation.  
To minimize manipulation of the eye, a VIS Implant Segment should be placed in each Lamellar 
Scleral Tunnel made prior to proceeding to the creation of the next Lamellar Scleral tunnel.  If fo r 
any reason, only one or two  Lamellar Scleral Tunnels are able to be implanted with VIS Implant 
Segments, these segments will be removed from the eye.  
The VIS Scleratome requires winding of the knob prior to creation of the next scleral tunnel.

 5. Implantation of the VisAbility I mplant Segment  
To facilitate hand positioning, inferior quadrant tunnels (IN and IT) should be entered forehand from 
the inferior end of the tunnel. Superior quadrant tunnels (SN and ST) should be entered backhand 
from the superior end of the tunnel.  
While  continuing to maintain fixation of the eye with the VIS Docking Station, immediately after the 
creation and verification  of each tunnel, grasp the Shuttle / Implant segment assembly 
approximately 12mm from its leading edge and insert the front end of the shuttle into the tunnel and 
advance the VIS Shuttle / Implant segment assembly into the tunnel.  
CAUTION:  
When advancing t he VIS Shuttle / Implant segment assembly thru the scleral tunnel, the leading 
tip must be directed outwards (anteriorly) along the roo f of the tunnel to facilitate exiting from 
the tunnel and to avoid unintentional scleral perforation.  
After 3mm or more o f the VIS feeder tube has exited the tunnel, grasp the exited VIS feeder 
tube and pull the assembly until the feet of the VIS implant s egment have exited the tunnel.  
CAUTION:  
While pulling the VIS feeder tube thru the scleral tunnel, pay close attention t hat the Feeder 
tube does not begin to disinsert from the VIS implant segment prematurely.  
After the feet of the VIS implant segment hav e exited the tunnel, continued pulling of the VIS feeder 
tubing will disinsert it from the VIS Main Body Implant allowing  the compressed feet to open, 
effectively locking the VIS Main Body Implant into the tunnel.  
Using the VIS Center insert implant loadin g forceps, grasp the top edges of the VIS Center Insert 
implant at the midpoint and guide it into the receiving slot of t he VIS Main Body Implant. Use the 
VIS Center Insert implant loading forceps to then clasp the VIS center insert implant fully into the 
VIS main body Implant. A snap -like action will be apparent when the VIS center insert implant has 
been properly placed, I n addition, the outer edge of the assembled VIS Implant Segment will line 
up flush and smooth.  
Repeat tunnel creation and implantation for each of the four quadrants. If for any reason, only one 
or two Lamellar Scleral Tunnels are able to be implanted with  VIS Implant Segments, these 
segments will be removed from the eye.

 6. VIS Docking Station Removal  
Use the Actuation Tool to rotate each of the four fixation points of the VIS Docking Station 
counterclockwise 180 ˚ to the stop, to disengage the helical twists from the limbal sclera and 
completely unlock the device from the eye.  Once free of fixation, carefully lift the VIS Docking 
Station from the eye to avoid causing any corneal abrasion with the underside helical twists.  
After lifting the unit  from the eye, rinse away any excess clotted blood in the field. Reapply sterile 
2% xylocaine drops without epi[INVESTIGATOR_463260].  Check the implant location by [CONTACT_463346].  
7. Conjunctival Closure  
Ensure adequate hemostasis is obtained prior to closing the conjunctiva  
CAUTION:  
Due to the pote ntial of a detrimental effect on perfusion and / or scleral thickness, bipolar 
and / or thermal cautery should no t be used during surgery.  Should hemostasis be 
required, Evicel fibrin sealant (Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd., Kiryat Ono, Israel)  or 
TISSEEL  fibrin sealant (Baxter International, Inc ., Deerfield, IL)  may be used.  
 
Bring the conjunctiva into position to approximate where it will need to be located when closed.  
Starting nasally, use a 9 -0 braided Vicryl suture or equivalent with a modified mattr ess technique, 
starting nasally, close 3 and 9 o’clock as needed such as using a 3mm scleral bite tan gential to the 
limbus and a 4 -5mm conjunctival bite then at 6 and 12 o’clock as needed.  
Care must be taken to ensure a smooth, uniform, minimally wrinkled conjunctival closure.  
8. After Conjunctival Closure  
At the completion of the surgery, a removable punctual plug should be placed in the inferior 
punctum and an initial dose of antibiotic drops such as moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution or 
equivalent and ster oid drops such as prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic  suspension or 
equivalent should be instilled in the eye. Instruct the patient to keep their eyes closed, and use 
ice compresses to decrease swelling.  
  
[ADDRESS_593406] -Operative Care  
Following surgery, physic ians should adhere to the following guidelines o f topi[INVESTIGATOR_463242]:  
• To help control pain postoperatively, an icepack should be applied to the eye at intervals for 
approximately 30 minutes or longer as needed.  A topi[INVESTIGATOR_15385] -steroidal  anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) such as nepafena c ophthalmic suspension or equivalent may also be instilled immediately 
postoperatively.  Chilled BSS may be instilled every 15 minutes and topi[INVESTIGATOR_463261] 1% ophthalmic sus pension or equivalent may be used every 15 to 30  
minutes until the pupil reaction is greater than 25% as described in the next step.  Prior to discharge 
the patient should be given Diamox 500mg Sequel PO or equivalent.  
• Pupil functionality will be evaluated  postoperatively using a NeurOptics Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463262] 
[ADDRESS_593407] 25%.  A second, confirmatory 
reading of 25% or greater may be taken as soon as [ADDRESS_593408] 25% are not achieved within the first [ADDRESS_593409] 25% are not achieved within 6 hours postoperatively.  
• During the first week after the surgery, antibiotic drops such as moxifloxacin ophthalmic 
solution or equivalent and topi[INVESTIGATOR_463263].  Additionally, NSAIDs such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_463264] / or oral medications such as naproxen or equivalent or acetaminophen with codeine 
or equivalent may be given as needed for pain during this time.  
Procedure t o Surgically Remove VIS Implant Segments  
Subjects may request to have the VIS implant segments removed at any time. The VIS Implant 
segment removal procedure, if requested and deemed safe to do so by [CONTACT_463347].  
Magnification of the surgical area at a surgical microscope is advised.  
Preoperative sterile prep and drape is required.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_463265] 2% xylocaine drops without epi[INVESTIGATOR_463266] I mplant segment removal.  A drop of Brimonidine 0.1% or 
0.15% or equivalent may also be used to decrease bleeding.  
Using a sterile sharp blade such as a 15 degree ophthalmic sharp, 18 to 21  gauge hollow injection 
needle, or equivalent, a small (2mm) scratch  down incision of the conjunctiva is made over both 
exposed ends of the VIS Implant segment.  
Use a forceps such as a .12 forceps to further expose the ends of the VIS Implant Segment from 
the overlying conjunctiva.

Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 Once the ends of the VIS Implant s egment are un -encapsulated, grip the solid end of the VIS Main 
Body implant with the jaws of the VIS Cutter (966 -0030) with the tips perpendicular to the length of 
the implant and one tip flat  to the sclera. Ensure that the full portion of the widened extr a lamellar 
scleral tunnel portion of the VIS Main Body implant is fully enclosed within the VIS Cutter. Close the 
VIS cutter to sever the complete solid, wide end of the VIS Main Body Implant.   
Carefully remove the severed pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959](s) of the VIS Main Body Imp lant segment from the Cutter and 
inspect the cut end for any barb that might remain and carefully sever it.  
Using the VIS Implant Loading Forceps, the distal end of the Shuttle forceps or othe r toothed 
forceps grasp the uncut end of the VIS Implant segment , and pull it through the tunnel with a slight 
twisting motion to remove it from the eye.  
Repeat for each Implant segment requiring removal.  
After completing removal of all required VIS implan t segments, the scleral and conjunctival areas 
that have been op ened should be assessed to see if they will heal primarily, if they need inflated 
with an intra tenon’s injection of BSS or need to be sutured with an appropriate gauge suture.  
An initial dose  of antibiotic drops such as moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution or  equivalent and 
steroid drops such as prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic suspension or equivalent should 
be instilled in the eye.  
A light dressing may be applied to keep the eyes closed overni ght for patient comfort.  
During the first week after the surgery , antibiotic drops such as moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 
or equivalent and topi[INVESTIGATOR_463243] 1% ophthalmic 
suspension or equivalent should be instilled in t he eye.  Additionally, NSAIDs such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_463267] / or oral naproxen or equivalent may be 
given as needed for pain during this time.

 APPENDIX 3: PATIENT -REPORTED OUTCOME (PRO) INSTRUMENT  
FOR USE IN PROTOCO L VIS -2014  
 
I. Introduction  
The Near Activity Visual Questionnaire (NAVQ) is a PRO instrument designed for use in study 
subjects receiving presby[CONTACT_463348]. The Near Activity Visual Questionnair e (NAVQ) consists of [ADDRESS_593410] 10 
items.  
II. Instructions for NAVQ Use  
The NAVQ instrument should be self -administered to avoid bias in reporting, as r ecommended by 
[CONTACT_463349]. [1]   It is anticipated that completion of the NAVQ wi ll be a modest burden 
on the trial sub jects.  The layout and font size were optimized by [CONTACT_463350] -administration, and it is being used as published.  
At designated  visits, the questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_463351], prio r to 
any clinical assessments of vision.  Study subjects will be instructed to answer each question about 
their recent everyday experience with near vision without any spectacle correction.  All responses 
will be docum ented by [CONTACT_463352] a paper  case report form.  Subjects will be encouraged 
to complete the full questionnaire and completed questionnaires will be checked by [CONTACT_463353].  The script to be used by [CONTACT_463354] C.  
It is critical that study subjects understand that they are reporting on their near visual function 
without the use of reading glasses.  It is expected that study participants will be close to emmetrop ic 
with a need for some add power for certain near tasks.  As a result, subjects will be instructed to 
answer the questions about their near vision when they are not using their reading glasses or any 
other corrective lenses.  
Testing of the NAVQ has been associated with minimal missing data, indicating that the content of 
the questions is generally relevant and acceptable to patients who have had surgical correction of 
presby[CONTACT_19555]. [1, 3].

 III. The PRO Instrument’s Conceptual Framework  
 
The sections below describe the NAVQ and its validation using the principles described i n FDA’s 
Guidance, “Patient -Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support 
Labeling Claims”.  
The NAVQ was designed with the stated purpose of creating a standardized questionnaire to 
subjectively assess near visual function and sat isfaction with a variety of presby[CONTACT_19555] -correction 
techniques. [1, 2]   The NAVQ is a 10 -item questionnaire wi th an additional global question about 
satisfaction.  The 10 -items are combined into a single score where high scores indicate greater 
difficulty with near vision ta sks (Table 1). The NAVQ therefore measures the construct of difficulty 
with near visual tas ks using 10 items and the concept of ‘satisfaction with near vision’ is assessed 
separately with a single global question (Figure 1).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIGURE 1: CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE NAVQ [1] 
 
IV. Content Validity Documentation  
 
A. Literature review and documentation of expert input:  
 
The patient perspective on the outcome of a medical intervention is helpful  because such a 
perspective may provide supplemental information both to patients and physicians regarding the 
performance of the interven tion.  The VisAbility Implant Procedure is designed to improve near 
vision in presby[CONTACT_35577].  The primary outcom e of the proposed trial is the improvement in 
distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at a distance of 40cm in the primary eye at [ADDRESS_593411] presby[CONTACT_19555].   While there was uniformity in the collection of visual acuity data, 
there was no consistency in th e questionnaires used for Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO).   
Patient satisfact ion and spectacle independence have mostly been collected as individual items, 
usually on a Likert scale (14/20 trials).  One trial used the VF -[ADDRESS_593412] undergone 
extensive validation, only one was specifically conceptualized, designed and validated for the 
assessmen t of the correction or reduction of presby[CONTACT_19555].  That questionnaire is the Nea r Activity 
Visual Questionnaire (NAVQ). [1-3]   
 
B. Qualitative study protocols  
The N AVQ was developed with the aim to be able to assess near visual function and satisfaction 
with a variety of presby[CONTACT_19555] -correction techniques. [1, 2]  As the VisAbility Implant Procedure is a 
surgical correction for presby[CONTACT_19555], the application of the NAVQ falls within the scope of the intended 
population for this instrument .  Because NAVQ is a published instrument  for which content validity 
has already been demonstrated as described herein, Refocus Group, Inc. has not performed 
additional qualitative studies to investigate content validity.   
 
C. Origin and derivation of items with chronology of events for item genera tion, 
modification and finalization:  
 
The development of the NAVQ has been described in a publication by [INVESTIGATOR_321379], et al (n=22) [2]  and 
in a second larger study by [CONTACT_463355], et al (n=150). [1]  The proces s of item generation involved a 
review of published vision -related quality of life (VR -QOL) questionnaires to identify any items 
relating to near vision tasks.  This search found 374 candidate items. [2]  This bank of items was 
reduced by [CONTACT_463356] (5 
ophthalmolo gists and 3 optometrists) and 10 lay -peop le with presby[CONTACT_19555] [2] at which time it was 
possible to add questions to cover any new areas identified.  This  review process resulted in 19 
candidate items which was reduced to a 9 -item questionnaire plus a global question about 
satisfaction using the Rasch Model. [2]   
 
Though this questionnaire was considered to be internally consistent, reliable and a valid instrument 
for assessing accommodating IOLs, the authors suggested the addition of items to better target 
patient s with good near vision and to allow assessment of other types of presby[CONTACT_463357]. [2]  
Subsequently, Buc khurst  expanded the instrument to 26 items and revisited the psychometric 
properties in a population of 150 patients with varying types of corrections for presby[CONTACT_19555]. [1]   
  
  
3 
PROTOCOL VIS -2014   Page 64  
Compi[INVESTIGATOR_463225] 2 - March 3 , 201 5   
  
 The Rasch model was used to reduce the 26 items to those relevant to near visual function, the 
concept being measured. [1]  The number of items was reduced by [CONTACT_463358]: 
item fit statistics, item targeting, frequency of endorsement and skew an d kurtosis.  The outfit mean 
square was required to fall within the range of 0.6 to 1.4 where items below 0.6 were considered 
too predictable and those above 1. 4 were considered too variable.  The targeting was evaluated 
using a person map of items. [4]  Frequency of endorsement was kept in the range of 65 to  85% to 
ensure the questions were relevant.  Skew indicates the symmetry of the frequency distribution of 
responses and kurtosis the height of the peak of the d istribution.  Items with skew or kurtosis >2 
were excluded.  Items were removed one at a time an d item statistics recalculated each time until 
all of the items fitted the Rasch model. [1]  This final NAVQ had 10 items and a global item about 
satisfaction.  
 
D. Summary that supports content validity:  
 
Item content : The involvement of patients in review of the candidate items is recommended in 
the FDA guidance document regarding the use of PRO’s i n clinical studies. [5]  .Patient input 
was part of the development of the NAVQ instrument as described above [2].   
 
Additionally, Refocus Group, Inc. has conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1427] y to confirm whether patients who 
have undergone the VisAbility Implant Procedure understand the NAVQ and are able to answ er 
the questions.  The NAVQ was administered over the telephone to [ADDRESS_593413] -operative subjects 
in the IDE G970152 clinical trial so the ir understanding could be ascertained.  The subjects were 
able to understand and answer all of the questions.  
   
Response Options:  During development, items were required to have frequency of 
endorsement in the range of 65 to 85% to ensure the questions we re relevant but not 
redundantly predictable. [1]  All items were originally assigned a 6 -point Likert scale, however 
the rating scale was scrutinized using category function statistics to refine the respons e scale 
and a 4 -point scale was recommended. [1]  With the 4 -point scale, respondents were ab le to 
use the scale to reliably represent their level of difficulty with the task.  For the satisfaction scale 
the 6 -point Likert scale was ret ained. All items are consistent in that higher scores represent 
greater difficulty or greater dissatisfaction.  
 
Recall period:   The questionnaire does not specify a recall period and refers to the patient’s 
current vision status.  As the tasks are commonly  encountered in everyday life , the subject 
should be able to reference a recent experience within the past few d ays relevant to all 
questions in the NAVQ. If a subject does not perform an activity or has stopped doing the activity 
for a reason other than because of their vision, they will be asked to answer “0”, for “Not 
Applicable”.  As the instrument is scored usi ng the Rasch model rather than a raw score, the 
person score can be created despi[INVESTIGATOR_463268].  
 
Scoring:   The instr ument is recommended to be scored using the Rasch Model to enable 
generation of an interval score. [1]    Buckhurst validated the scoring in a clinical population 
comprised of 150 subjects including patient s with a range of corrections for presby[CONTACT_19555]:  
monofocal, accommodating, and multifocal intraocular lenses, multifocal contact [CONTACT_463359]. The questionnaires were administered [ADDRESS_593414] lens fi tting and 3 to 8 months after varifocal spectacles were dispensed.

follows.   
 
A. Reliability:   It is important that a PRO can yield a consistent, reproducible estimate of effect.  
The repeatability of the NAVQ score h as been assessed by [CONTACT_463362] -class 
correlation coe fficient (ICC) in a sub -set of [ADDRESS_593416] random effects intraclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC) for test -retest rel iability was estimated as 0.72.  This can be interpreted as hig h 
reliability.  Internal consistency was also investigated and the Cronbach α coefficient was 
0.[ADDRESS_593417] validity. [1]  The instructions for completing the questionnaire 
will be scripted to ensure no variability between administrations such that the reliability of 
the instrument will be maintained during the IDE study.  
 
  
[ADDRESS_593418] validity:   Buckhurst investigated the relationship between the NAVQ and 
objectively measured distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA, logMAR) and critical 
print size (CPS).  CPS was th e smallest print size on the Minnesota Low Vision Reading  
Test (MN -Read) chart that could be read at the patient’s maximum reading speed.  The 
correlation coefficient was 0.543 for DCNVA and 0.526 for CPS representing moderate 
correlations. [1]  The moderate correlation to reading is not surprising, since reading speed 
can also be affected by [CONTACT_463363], education and intelligence; and DCNVA at a 
standa rdized distance by [CONTACT_463364].    
 
C. Ability to detect change:   The person separation index (PSI) is the ratio of the  true variance 
in the estimated measures to the observed variance and indicates the number of distinct 
person strata that can be distinguished by [CONTACT_169847]. [6]  The NAVQ was reported to have a 
PSI of 2.92 which indicates excellent discriminant ability. [1]  Further, the NAVQ 
demonstrated the ability to distinguish between different types of presby[CONTACT_356832]. [1]  
It is anticipated that the NAVQ will be able to measure a change in near visual function from 
before to after surgery and det ermine if the near visual function is relatively stable a cross 
visits.  
 
VI. Interpretation of scores  
 
The NAVQ provides a score for patient reported near visual function and satisfaction with 
presby[CONTACT_356832].  It was found to be reliable and valid, using  standard, current psychometric 
techniques. [1]  The NAVQ was also able to discriminate betwe en those with and without near vision 
difficulties as shown by [CONTACT_463365] (Table 3) and 
as shown by [CONTACT_463366] (2.92). [1]   Therefore, NAVQ interval scores provide a relative 
measure of difficulty with near visual tasks and can be compared between subjects and across 
different time poi nts.   
 
VII. Language and cultural adaptation  
 
The NAVQ was developed and validated in the [LOCATION_008] in an English speaking population.  
The questionnaire has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_463269] [ADDRESS_593419] undergone the VisAbility Implant 
Procedure.  All ques tions were understood and there was no miss ing data.  Because the instrument 
has been successfully self -administered to 150 patients in the [LOCATION_006] during development [1] and in an 
evaluation of 15 patients in the [LOCATION_006] with a diffractive trifocal IOL [3], it is  likely that the readability is 
sufficient for an English speaking U.S. study population. As a result, the instrument will be 
administered in its original form in English without cultural adaptation.  
 
VIII. Modifications  
 
A comparison of the original NAVQ instr ument provided in Exhibit B and the PRO instrument to be 
used in the IDE clinical study, Exhibit A, shows that they are virtually identical.  The instructions, 
which have been adapted for the context of  this trial, are also virtually the same as the origin al 
NAVQ instrument.  Since there is only one presby[CONTACT_463367], the field where 
type of presby[CONTACT_463368] a single option. A subject identity  
field has been added at the top for completion by [CONTACT_463369][INVESTIGATOR_007].

 IX. Conclusion  
 
Although the PRO outcomes are not intended to support specific labeling claims, the NAVQ 
questionnaire’s characteristics, conceptual framework, content validity, and other measurement 
properti es (i.e. reliability, construct validity, and ability to detect change) are adequate for the 
instrument to serve as an additional evaluation in the IDE investigation of the VisAbility Implant 
System.

instructed to insure the subject completes the questionnaire independen tly.  
B.  HOW to g ive the NAVQ and HOW to answer questions:   
1. Give the subject a pen and the paper copy of the NAVQ on a clipboard.  
 
2. It is important that the patient is instructed to answer about their experience when not 
wearing reading glasses, magnifiers or corrective le nses of any type.  Ask the subject if 
they understand what is meant by “reading glasses, magnifiers or corrective l enses.    
 
3. Verbally give the subject the scripted instructions, visually checking after each 
instruction to see if the subject apparently und erstood the instruction.  
  
4. If subjects have questions, emphasize that there is no right or wrong answer and that i f 
they no longer perform some tasks due to non -visual reasons that they should mark “X” 
in the first column.  If they have stopped doing a ta sk because of vision, they should 
mark “3” for Extreme Difficulty.   
C.  Script  for Administration of NAVQ : 
1. ‘Please  fill out this short questionnaire before we get started with the examination.  You 
will need to write in your name, date of birth and today’s  date.  Circle the answer that 
most closely reflects your amount of difficulty with near vision tasks.  There is no  right or 
wrong answer.  I will check that you have completed all questions but will not p ay 
attention to any answers.

 2. ‘You should answer the questions about your near vision when you are not wearing 
reading glasses  or using magnifiers or  corrective lenses  of any type . Please let me know 
that you understand.’   
 
3. ‘The questions are about different activities where you need to see up close.  Again, y ou 
should respond based on your experience with these activities when you are not wearing 
reading glasses.’  
 
4. ‘If you don’t do or have stopped doing the activity for a reason other than because of 
your vision – please circle ‘X’ in the first column fo r ‘not applicable.’  We would like you 
to complete all of the questions .’

APPENDIX 6: ANTERIOR SEGMENT ISCHEMIA (ASI):  DETECTION, MITIGATION AND 
REPORTING  
Anterior Segment Ischemia (ASI) is a potentially serious but most often self -limited response to 
decreased perfusion that even in s evere cases generally resolves without sequelae or detrimental 
effects on vision.  The rich collateral blood supply of the anterior segment likely explains its 
relatively benign  common clinical course.  
Decreased constriction of the pupil in response to lig ht is the earliest physiological indicator of ASI 
and serves as a bellwether indicating diminished perfusion.  Recovery of perfusion, when it occurs 
at this mild stage, avoids potential sequelae such a s persistent pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463271].  
Monitoring the p upi[INVESTIGATOR_463272].  
In this clinical study of the VisAbility Implant, Refocus has adopted di gital infrared dynamic 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463273] a sensitive indicator of neuromuscular disturbance secondary to decreased iris 
vascular perfusion in the immediate postoperative period.  Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463274], thus reversing impaired 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463275] a. 
Clinical Syndrome, Natural History and Severity Grad ing 
ASI represents an acute, generally self -limited response of the anterior segment of the eye to 
decreased vascular perfusion.  While mild cases most often resolve without sequelae, more 
severe cases  may develop persistent pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463276].  Though rare, 
cataract and hypotony have been reported in a few isolated, very severe cases.  
The clinical syndrome of ASI was first described in [ADDRESS_593429] demonstrated that the anterior ciliary arte ries are the source of 70 to 
80% of the circulation of the anterior segment, including the iris and ciliary body.  The long 
posterior ciliary arteries provide the remainder, along with some contribution from the 
conjunctiva .3  The anterior ciliary arteries  run along the rectus muscles, divid ing into multiple 
branches and forming three levels of collateral anastomoses near the muscles’ scleral insertion 
points.  This rich collateral circulation likely explains the rarity and generally self -limited nature of 
postoperative ASI.

on the natural history of ASI.  Patients with severe iris ischemia may develop iris atrophy, 
decreased pupil reactivity a nd an oval or irregular pupil.  
Case reports and series in the literature reveal the natural his tory typi[INVESTIGATOR_463277].  F or example, 
Forbes reported on a case of Grade 4 ASI occurring after a four muscle operation.  Striate 
keratopathy initially reduced the visual acuity to 20/200.  Over two months the vision improved to 
20/30. Iris atrophy and an irre gular pupil were the on ly sequelae .5 Keech et al described a case of 
Grade 4 ASI following a transposition procedure in a 74 year old  woman with hypertension. On 
postoperative day 1, visual acuity was reduced to 20/100.  Slit lamp exam revealed an oval pup il 
with an atonic sphincter, anterior chamber reaction and striate keratopathy.  By 6 weeks all clinical 
signs had resolved except fo r a sluggishly reactive, oval pupil .6

 Saunders et al reported on a series of cases involving surgery on three extraocul ar muscles .7 Five 
adult patients developed acute ASI, including 3 with pupil signs and anterior chamber reaction 
(Grade 3) and 2 with striate keratopathy (Grade 4).  Treatment consisted of topi[INVESTIGATOR_463278].  With the exception of corectopia, t here was complete resolution of all signs within [ADDRESS_593431] patients occurred within 4 weeks of surgery.  Only 2 eyes 
in the entire series demonstrated long -term pupil changes; the re maining eyes had no sequelae.  
To further elucidate the natural history of ASI, Bagheri et al investigated ASI in a rabbit model, 
chosen for its anatomic similarity to the human, including the significant contribution of the 
vasculature of the 4 rectus muscles to nourishment of the anterior segment .8  Performing various 
combinations of surgery i nvolving from 1 to 4 mu scles, they found that 51 eyes (30.4%) 
developed signs of ASI, but in most cases inflammation and corneal edema resolved 
spontaneously and histopathology revealed no major permanent ischemic changes.  Long -term 
complications included  pupil irregularity and  decreased response to light in [ADDRESS_593432] not been proven 
as useful.  Iris angiography is not a useful tool for predi cting which patients may develop clinical 
signs of decreased perfusion; therefore, iris angiography has not been standardized as a means 
of assessing postoperative iris perfusion, nor has it been utilized to assess the risk of sequel ae.9 
In addition, iris angiography does not reveal filling of intrastromal vessels in eyes with highly 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_463279].  Further, the dye pattern is different in each individual, with a wide range of 
normal filling times and patterns. Additionally, valida ted commercial instrume nts designed 
specifically for iris angiography are not currently available, so iris angiography requires 
modification of existing equipment.10 Lastly, iris angiography adds risk due to potential reactions 
to intravenous fluorescein d ye and may also prove d ifficult due to the status of the ocular surface 
and subjects’ reduced ability to comply with the procedure in the immediate postoperative period 
due to fatigue and residual effects of intraoperative sedation.  
  
[ADDRESS_593433] sensitive means to assess the eye’s recovery from surgery 
because pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463280] (ASI).15  The purpose of pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463281].  
Infrared digital pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463282]; an 
image capture system with an infrared di gital camera capable of obtaining pupil measurements 
throughout the entire examination process (pupil diameter at rest, during light stimulation, and at 
the end of the stimulus), without interfering with pupil respon se because it provides no visible 
light;  and a data processor to perform calculations.16  Using this type of device, i.e., the 
NeurOptics NPi™ -200 Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187] (Neuroptics, Inc., Irvine, CA)], the mean percent pupil 
constriction in a population of healthy adults has been determined to be 34% acc ording to the 
formula %CH ={[dilated pupil diameter – constricted pupil diameter]/[dilated pupil diameter]} x 
100.17  The authors of this study noted that, “in only one of 2432 measurements was the 
percentage of redu ction below 10%.[ADDRESS_593434] in whom the 
baseline mean percent pupil constriction is less than 30% in either eye, so that any impact of 
surgery on pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463283].  
In this protocol we have adopted  the following instrumentation, threshold criterion and standard 
operating procedures:  
• Measurement of the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463284]™ -200 
Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187] (Neuroptics, Inc., Irvine, CA)[ADDRESS_593435] -operative period at 
15-30 minute intervals and recording the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463285] a percentage 
constriction based on the following formula:  
Percent Change (%CH) = {[dilated pupil diameter – constricted pupil diameter]/[dilated pu pil 
diameter]} x 100  
• A threshold criteri on value of %CH ≥ 25% constriction in the operative eye at two 
distinct time points at least 5 minutes apart  
• Immediate removal of all PSI from any eye which does not achieve the threshold 
criterion within 6 hours postoperatively and before the patient is released from the 
facility; and

 • Mandatory electronic reporting of pupil constriction values to Refocus.  
 
This procedure is shown in the flow chart below.  
 
 
These procedures are designed to allow for timely recognition of persistent reduction in the 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_463286].  
Adverse Event Reporting  
As described above, implant segments are to be removed from any eye with Grade 2 ASI (acutely 
decreased pupil reactivity) or Grade 3 ASI (decre ased pupil reactivity plus anterior chamber 
reaction) persisting 6 hours postoperative; therefore, the AE category “Secondary Surgical 
Intervention: I mplant segment removal”  should be reported for these cases.  At postoperative day 
one or later, the conste llation of findings of Grade 4 ASI, i.e., corneal edema, anterior chamber

WORLD  MEDICAL  ASSOCIATION  DECLARATION  OF HELSINKI  
Ethical  Principles  for Medical  Research  Involving  Human  Subjects  
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General  Assembly,  Helsinki,  Finland, June 1964, and  amended by [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General  Assembly,  Tokyo,  Japan, October [ADDRESS_593439] WMA General  Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General  Assembly,  Tokyo 2004  (Note of Clarification  on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General  Assembly,  Seoul, October 2008  
 
A.        INTRODUCTION  
 
1. The World  Medical  Association  (WMA)  has developed  the Declaration  of Helsinki  as a 
statement  of ethical  principles  for medical  research  involving  human  subjects , including  
research  on identifiable  human  material  and data.  
 
The Declarat ion is intended  to be read as a whole  and each of its constituent  paragraphs  
should  not be applied  without  consideration  of all other  relevant  paragraphs.  
 
2. Although  the Declaration  is addressed  primarily  to physicians,  the WMA  encourages  
other  participants  in medical  research  involving  human  subjects  to adopt  these  
principles.  
 
3. It is the duty of the physician  to promote  and safeguard  the health  of patients,  including  those  
who are involved  in medical  research.  The physician's  knowledge  and conscience  are 
dedicated  to the fulfilment  of this duty.  
 
4. The Declaration  of Geneva  of the WMA  binds  the physician  with the words,  “The  health  
of my patient  will be my first consideration,”  and the International  Code  of Medical  
Ethics  declares  that, “A physician  shall  act in the patient's  best interest  when  providing  
medical  care.”  
 
5. Medical  progress  is based  on research  that ultimately  must  include  studies  involving  
human  subjects.  Populations  that are underrepresented  in medical  research  should  be 
provided  appropriate  access to participation  in research.  
 
6. In medical  research  involving  human  subjects,  the well-being  of the individual  research  
subject  must  take precedence  over all other  interests.  
 
7. The primary  purpose  of medical  research  involving  human  subjects  is to underst and the 
causes,  development  and effects  of diseases  and improve  preventive,  diagnostic  and 
therapeutic  interventions  (methods,  procedures  and treatments).  Even  the best current  
interventions  must  be evaluated  continually  through  research  for their safety,  effectiveness,  
efficiency,  accessibility  and quality.  
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.  
PROTOCOL VIS -[ADDRESS_593440],  incentives  for subjects  and 
provisions  for treating  and/or  compen sating  subjects  who are harmed  as a consequence  of 
participation  in the research  study.  The protocol  should  describe  arrangements  for post-
study  access  by [CONTACT_463388].  
 
15. The research  protocol  must  be submitted  for consideration,  comment,  guidance  and 
approval  to a research  ethics  committee  before  the study  begins.  This committee  must  be 
independent  of the researcher,  the sponsor  and any other  undue  influ ence.  It must  take into 
consideration  the laws and regulations  of the country  or countries  in which  the research  is 
to be performed  as well as applicable  international  norms  and standards  but these  must  not 
be allowed  to reduce  or eliminate  any of the protections  for research  subjects  set forth  in 
this Declaration.  The committee  must  have  the right  to monitor  ongoing  studies.  The 
researcher  must  provide  monitoring  information  to the committee,  especially  information  
about  any serious  adverse  events.  No change to the protocol  may be made  without  
consideration  and approval  by [CONTACT_942].  
  
PROTOCOL VIS -[ADDRESS_593441]’s  freely -given  informed  consent,  preferably  
PROTOCOL VIS -[ADDRESS_593442]  normally  
seek consent  for the collection,  analysis,  storage  and/or  reuse.  There  may be situations  
where  consent  would  be impossible  or impractical  to obtain  for such research  or would  
pose a threat  to the validity  of the research.  In such situations  the research  may be done  
only after consideration  and approval  of a research  ethics  committee.  
 
26. When  seeking  informed  consent  for participation  in a research  study  the physician  should  
be particularly  cautious  if the potential  subject  is in a dependent  relationship  with the 
physician  or may consent  under  duress.  In such situations  the informed  consent  should  be 
sought  by [CONTACT_463389].  
 
27. For a potential  research  subject  who is incompetent,  the physician  must  seek informed  
consent  from  the legally  authorized  representative.  These  individuals  must  not be 
included  in a research  study  that has no likelihood  of benefit  for them  unless  it is intended  
to promote  the health  of the population  represented  by [CONTACT_112988],  the research  
cannot  instead  be performed  with competent  persons,  and the research  entails  only 
minimal  risk and minimal  burden.  
 
28. When  a potential  research  subject  who is deemed  incompetent  is able to give assent  to 
decisions  about  participation  in research,  the physician  must  seek that assent  in addition  to 
the consent  of the legally  authorized  representative.  The potential  subject’s  dissent  should  
be respected.  
 
29. Research  involving  subjects  who are physically  or mentally  incapable  of giving  consent,  
for example,  unconscious  patients,  may be done  only if the physical  or mental  condition  
that prevents  giving  informed  consent  is a necessary  characteristic  of the research  
population.  In such circumstances  the physician  should  seek informed  consent  from  the 
legally  authorized  representative.  If no such representative  is available  and if the research  
cannot  be delayed,  the study  may proceed  without  informed  consent  provided  that the 
specific  reasons  for involving  subjects  with a condition  that renders  them  unable  to give 
informed  consent  have  been  stated  in the research  protocol  and the study  has been  
approved  by a research  ethics  committee.  Consent  to remain  in the research  should  be 
obtained  as soon  as possible  from  the subject  or a legally  authorized  representative.  
 
30. Authors,  editors  and publishers  all have  ethical  obligations  with regard  to the publication  of 
the results  of research.  Authors  have  a duty to make  publicly  available  the         results  of 
their research  on human  subjects  and are accountable  for the completeness  and accuracy  of 
their reports.  They  should  adhere  to accepted  guidel ines for ethical  reporting.  Negative  and 
inconclusive  as well as positive  results  should  be published  or otherwise  made  publicly  
available.  Sources  of funding,  institutional  affiliations  and conflicts  of interest  should  be 
declared  in the publication.  Repo rts of research  not in accordance  with the principles  of this 
Declaration  should  not be accepted  for publication.  
 
PROTOCOL VIS -[ADDRESS_593443] current  proven  intervention,  except  in the following  
circumstances:  
• The use of placebo,  or no treatment,  is acceptabl e in studies  where  no current  
proven  intervention  exists;  or 
• Where  for compelling  and scientifically  sound  methodological  reasons  the use of 
placebo  is necessary  to determine  the efficacy  or safety  of an intervention  and the 
patients  who receive  placebo  or no treatment  will not be subject  to any risk of 
serious  or irreversible  harm.  Extreme  care must  be taken  to avoid  abuse  of this 
option.  
 
33. At the conclusion  of the study,  patients  entered  into the study  are entitled  to be informed  
about  the outcome  of the study and to share  any benefits  that result  from  it, for   
example,  access  to interventions  identified  as beneficial  in the study  or to other  
appropriate  care or benefits.  
 
34. The physician  must  fully inform  the patient  which  aspects  of the care are related  to the 
research.  The refusal  of a patient  to participate  in a study  or the patient’s  decision  to 
withdraw  from  the study  must  never  interfere  with the patient -physician  relationship.  
 
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the 
patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in 
the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishin g health or 
alleviating suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of 
research, designed to  evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information 
should be  recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why This Study IsBeing Conducted
The ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination is an innovative combination therapy that 
targets non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_226894] (SLE).  As 
described below, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibition via upadacitinib is expected to disrupt T cell activation 
and Type I interferon (IFN) signaling ,whereas elsubrutinib (ABBV -105) is expected to inhibit B cell 
activation and immune complex -driven activation of dendritic cells (and neutrophils).  As such, the 
ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination has the potenti al for differentiated efficacy in SLE 
through concurrent inhibition of multiple pathogenic nodes.
Autoantibody generation by [CONTACT_226899] B cells, which is dependent on B cell receptor signaling, is a 
hallmark of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthr itis (RA) and SLE.1
Bruton 's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non- receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in multiple immune cell types 
associated with the pathogenesis of RA , SLE, and other autoimmune diseases.  BTK is required for the 
propagation of pro -inflammatory signals downstream of immunoreceptors that promote autoimmune 
disease pathogenesis.
The hematopoietic expression and signaling function of BTK downstream of numerous receptors has 
raised interest in pharmacologic targeting of BTK for immune -med iated inflammatory diseases including 
RA.[ADDRESS_570587] demonstrated:  1) complete abrog ation of arthritis in the 
collagen -induced arthritis model when initiated at disease onset, consistent with the effect of BTK 
inhibition on autoantibody production,3,42) efficacy in myeloid -mediated animal arthritis models, 
consistent with the effects of BTK inhibition on macrophage, mast cell, dendritic cell, and neutrophil 
activity,3,4and 3) marked reductions of proteinuria in mouse mod els of lupus, consistent with the effect 
of BTK inhibition on autoantibody production and/or myeloid cell activation.5-7
Upadacitinib (ABT -494) ,an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that displays unique selectivity for the JAK1 
receptor , was approved in 2019 under the brand name [CONTACT_448413] ™for the treatment of patients with RA in 
the [LOCATION_002] (US), the European Union (EU), and Japan.  Upadacitinib is currently being developed 
for the treatment of:  adult patients with Crohn 's disease (CD) , ulcerative colitis (UC), psoriatic arthritis, 
active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) , giant cell arteritis (GCA) , adult and pediatric patients with 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and pediatric patients with polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA).
Clinical Hypothesis
It isanticipated that inhibition of either JAK1 or BTK will result in amelioration of lupus disease activity 
with increased efficacy delivered by [CONTACT_448371] -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination.
BTK inhibition by [CONTACT_226900]1 inhibition by [CONTACT_448372], Tcell activation, and Type I IFN signaling as well as block local immune complex -driven tissue

the ABBV- 599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination on background standard of care has the potential 
to provide greater clinical efficacy compared to current standard of care while maintaining an 
acceptable safety profile.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
The ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination of BTK inhibition by [CONTACT_226900]1 
inhibition by [CONTACT_448373].
Upadacitinib is approved as a single -ingredient agent for the treatment of RA and is being developed for
the treatment of other inflammatory diseases, several of which are in Phase [ADDRESS_570588] on the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) at efficacious 
drug levels, in contrast to its inhibitory effects on JAK1.  Review of the available safety data has 
determined the following common AEs (upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], increased blood creatine 
phosphokinase [CPK] , herpes zoster, nausea, cough, herpes simplex, neutropenia, pneumonia, 
hypercholesterolemia, and pyrexia) to be possibly causally related to treatment with upadacitinib.  
Events of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been reported in patients receiving JAK 
inhibitors including upadacitinib.  Phase [ADDRESS_570589] determined the following as important 
identified risks for upadacitini b therapy :serious infections (including opportunistic infections and 
tuberculosis [TB]) and herpes zoster.  Upadacitinib offers a favorable benefit /risk ratio in the treatment 
of adult RA, which supports further clinical development of upadacitinib in ot her immunoinflammatory 
indications (e.g., SLE, CD, UC, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, axSpA, JIA, and GCA).
A detailed description of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and toxicology datasets can be found in 
the elsubrutinib8and upadacitinib9Investigator 's Brochures .  The results of genetic toxicology testing 
indicate that elsubrutinib and upadacitinib arenot genotoxic.  Preclinical embryofetal development 
studies indicate that elsubrutinib and/or upadacitinib are embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and/or teratogenic.
In Phase 1 Studies M16 -356 (single doses of elsubrutinib ranging from 2 to 125 mg), M16 -357 (multiple 
doses of elsubrutinib ranging from 3 to60 mg), and M16 -044 (co -administration of upadacitinib 30 mg 
with elsubrutinib ranging from 10 to60 mg), elsubrutinib alone or elsubrutinib co-administration with 
upadacitinib was well -tolerated with no severe or serio us adverse events (SAEs) observed in healthy 
adult subjects.  The most common adverse event (AE ) reported was headache, which was distributed 
evenly across cohorts including placebo and without apparent dose effect.
SLE patients are known to have an increa sed risk of thrombosis.  Based on this and the potential risk of 
thrombosis with the use of JAK inhibitors, the use of estrogen -containing contraceptives may further 
increase the risk of thrombotic events; therefore, the choice of contraceptive should be c arefully 
considered.
Taken together, the safety data from the Phase 1 program support further development of elsubrutinib
given alone or in combination with upadacitinib (ABBV -599 [elsubrutinib/upadacitinib] combination ) in 
Phase 2 in subjects with SLE.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].InStudy M19 -130, routine safety evaluation sof all treatment groups will be performed.  These include 
assessments of deaths, SAEs, non -serious AEs, withdrawals, and pregnancies, as well as routine 
monitoring by [CONTACT_31029], vital sign measurements , electrocardiogram s(ECG s), and clinical 
laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis).
For the safety of subjects, the following screening exclusions and ongoing assessments are included in 
the protocol:
Exclusion of subjects with chronic or recent infections;
Screen subjects for TB; exclude subjects with active TB or latent TB without history of 
appropriate prophylaxis [latent TB as assessed by [CONTACT_226903] (IGRA QuantiFERON 
TB Gold In-Tube Test or equivalent), and/or a purified p rotein derivative (tuberculin) ([COMPANY_003]) test 
(or both if required per local guidelines)].
If different national regulations exist for screening for latent TB while being on 
immunosuppressive treatment, these national regulations will be applied, respectively.
Subjects will also be screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B (HB) and 
C infections.
If a subject develops a serious infection (including coronavirus disease 2019 [ COVID -19]) or 
serious opportunistic infection (excludes non -serious oropharyngeal candidiasis) with study 
treatment, study drug should be interrupted and appropriate treatment of the infection should 
be initiated.
Review SAEs of infection on a real -time basis and query for additional information as clinically 
indicated .
Asupplemental herpes zoster form will be used to collect additional information for any herpes 
zoster events.
See Section 3.5for detailed safety monitoring and information on the Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC).

tolerability for t he entire study duration.
SAEs will be assessed at any dose that results in a death, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967], persistent or significant disability/incapacity ,or a congenital anomaly.
The following areas of saf ety interest will be routinely assessed to identify any major safety findings 
related to immunosuppression or potential risks associated with the individual classes of therapy:  
serious and/or opportunistic infections, herpes zoster, active TB , malignanc ies(all types), adjudicated
gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, adjudicated cardiovascular events (e.g., major adverse cardiovascular 
event [MACE]), anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, renal dysfunction, hepatic disorders, and 
adjudicated embolic and thromboe mbolic events (non-cardiac, non- central nervous system [CNS])
including venous thrombo ticevents defined as pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.  Specific 
toxicity management measures will be utilized, as described in Section 6.2, for serious infections, serious 
GIevents, cardiovascular events (MACE), malignanc ies, ECG abnormalities, and select laboratory

STUDY M19 -130  |   Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_570591] dose of study drug should occur 
to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs, or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.
An unblinded internal DMC will be established to ensure the overall integrity and conduct of the study.  
DMC reviews will be conducted at regular intervals (see Section 5.10 for more details) .  Regular 
systematic reviews of emerging safety data from all clinical studies with elsubrutinib , upadacitinib, and 
ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination will be conducted by [CONTACT_26282].
An independent exter nalCardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) will adjudicate all blinded 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, embolic/thrombotic events ,and deaths, as defined in the 
CAC charter.
3.6 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Elsubrutinib and upadacitinib plasma conc entrations will be summarized at each sampling time point 
(Appendix D ) using descriptive statistics.  A mixed -effects modeling approach may be used to estimate 
the population central value and the empi[INVESTIGATOR_448355] (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V ss/F).  Additional 
parameters and pharmacokineti c (PK)/pharmacodynamic relationships may be estimated if useful in the 
interpretation of the data.
3.7 Biomarker Research
Biospecimens (whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs ], plasma, and serum) will be 
collected at specified time points ( Appendix D ) throughout the study to evaluate known and/or novel 
disease -related or drug -related biomarkers.  Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], RNA, DNA, and/or metabolites.  The objective of this research is to analyze samples for 
biomarkers that will help to understand SLE, related conditions, and response to treatment with 
elsubrutinib, upadacitinib, and ABBV- 599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) com bination or similar compounds.  
Research on samples collected in [LOCATION_013] will be limited to SLE, elsubrutinib, upadacitinib, and 
ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination.  Biomarker samples will not be collected at sites in 
China as specified in Appendix D .
Type I IFN is a key driver of disease pathogenesis in lupus , and high IFN signature [CONTACT_448414].10,11  Approximately 60% of lupus patients ex press an elevated Type I IFN gene signature [CONTACT_448415], suggesting higher Type I IFN activity in these individuals.  JAK1 inhibition is expected to disrupt 
Type I IFN signaling; therefore ,lupus patients expressing the Type I gene signature [CONTACT_448416] l ikely to 
benefit from treatment with ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination .  A Type I IFN RNA 
signature [CONTACT_448417] 4genes (IFI6, IFI27, IFIT1 ,and MX1) will be evaluated using a validated assay with 
a cut point set at ≥ -0.25 for IFNhigh vs< -0.25 for IFN low (-0.25 is the upper limit of the cut point)
using the Type I IFN Gene Expression Assay Score.  In the event an IFN score cannot be collected or 
analyzed at Screening due to COVID -[ADDRESS_570592] will still be enrolled in the study and 
assigned a score of Not Applicable for the Screening visit.  Samples drawn at the Week 4 and Week 24 
visits may be used for analysis, if collected.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].These results robustly dichotomize the IFNhigh and low population.  The assay will be performe d on 
Screening samples and at subsequent time points unless precluded by [CONTACT_318019] 
(IFN signature [CONTACT_448418]).  Screening values will be used as a 
criterion for subject enrichment with the goal o f enrolling 80% of the study subjects with high composite 
score.  Stratifying the study to include approximately 80% high IFN score population will allow for 
increased confidence in the subject population.
Two assays to monitor BTK activity will be include d.  A BTK phosphorylation assay (BTK Y223) will be 
performed on whole blood from all subjects, and serial PBMC pellet swill be isolated from a subset of 
subjects to monitor BTK occupancy.  Whole blood will be collected for fluorescence -activated cell sorting 
Bcell immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_448356] T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and natural killer lymphocyte (TBNK) 
measurement.
Research may also include analysis of genes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_7009], gene expression, and proteomic biomarkers 
that may associate with SLE, related co nditions, or the subject 's response to treatment.  This research is 
exploratory in nature and the results may not be included with the clinical study report.  Required 
biomarker samples will be collected and analyzed from all subjects, unless precluded by [CONTACT_448375] (for such cases, optionality of collection/analysis is given through an appropriate 
Informed Consent Form).

4.2 Discussion of Study Design
Choice of Control Group
This is a parallel -group study consisting of 5 treatment groups receiving elsubrutinib, upadacitinib, 
ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination, or matching placebo to assess the safety and 
efficacy of elsubrutinib or upadacitinib given alone or in combination (as the ABBV -599 
[elsubrutinib/upadacitinib] combination) once daily for 48 weeks in subjects with moderately or severely 
active SLE.  Placebo will serve as a reference for efficacy assessment while the additional efficacy of the
ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination will utilize in -study comparison to the elsubrutinib
and upadacitinib treatment groups .
Appropriateness of Measurements
Allefficacy and safety measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects 
with SLE being treated with immunosuppressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The first safety evaluation is at Week 2, and 
at all subsequent visits.  All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally

STUDY M19 -130  |   Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_570596] one of the following at Screening:  positi ve antinuclear antibody (ANA) (titer ≥ 1:80), anti- double 
stranded DNA (dsDNA), or anti -Smith antibodies .  The selection criteria identify individuals with active 
SLE that are the intended target population for treatment with elsubrutinib and/or upadacitin ib, based 
on the current knowledge of these drugs.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose selection in this study is based on analysis of PK, pharmacodynamic s, safety, and efficacy 
(upadacitinib only), data from Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers for elsubrutinib and ABBV -599
(elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination , Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies for upadacitinib in RA, as well as a 
published Phase 2 study of baricitinib in SLE.8,9,12
The 60 mg dose of elsubrutinib is intended to target exposures at or greater than those needed to 
achieve maximal peripheral BTK occupancy.  Following once -daily dosing of elsubrutinib 60 mg, peak 
and trough BTK occupancy at steady -state are predicted to be 99% and 89%, respectively.  Furthermore, 
the elsubrutinib dose of 60 mg (administered alone or with upadacitinib 30 mg) has been shown to be 
safe and well -tolerated in Ph ase 1 studies in healthy subjects.
The selected dosing regimens of upadacitinib are 15 mg and 30 mg QD (testing both dose levels in the 
ABBV -599 [elsubrutinib/upadacitinib] combination and only the higher dose in the upadacitinib 
monotherapy group).  In ad dition to evaluation of upadacitinib 30 mg QD monotherapy, the selected 
ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination regimens will enable evaluation of upadacitinib dose
response in combination with elsubrutinib.  These doses are based on the demonstrated efficacy and 
well-tolerated safety profile of upadacitinib at these 2 doses in Phase 3 RA studies.  Additionally, these 
doses are supported by [CONTACT_448378] a recently published Phase 2 study of bar icitinib in 
SLE.  In that study, the baricitinib 2 mg QD dosing regimen demonstrated negligible efficacy while the 
4mg QD regimen provided evidence of therapeutic benefit compared to placebo.  In vitro cellular 
inhibition of Type I IFN signaling in CD3+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes showed comparable potency 
between upadacitinib and baricitinib (i.e., comparable concentration producing 50% inhibition [IC 50] 
values).  Predicted plasma concentration -time profiles for upadacitinib and baricitinib indicate that the 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD dosing regimen is predicted to result in plasma concentrations that provide 
modestly higher inhibitory efficacy (e.g., time above IC 50) compared to the baricitinib 2 mg QD dosing 
regimen; whereas the upadacitinib [ADDRESS_570597] meet all of the following criteria in order to be included in the study.  Anything other than 
a positive response to the questions below will result in exclusion from study participation.

Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
Practice true abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements):  Refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject (periodic abstinence [e.g., c alendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods, and withdrawal] is not acceptable).
For the local requirements for contraception in Japan, please refer to Appendix F .
If required per local practices, WOCBP must commit to using 2 methods of contraception (either 2 highly 
effective methods or 1 highly effective method combined with 1 effective method).
Effective methods of birth control are th e following:
Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary 
mode of action, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study Day 1.
Male or female condom with or without spermicide.
Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with sp ermicide.
A combination of male condom with a cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide 
(double -barrier method).
A condom is required in the following countries:  [LOCATION_008] ( [LOCATION_006]), [LOCATION_013], and Spain.
If during the course of the study a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal (defined 
above) and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as defined above are no 
longer required.
It is important to note that the contraception requirements described above are specifically intended to 
prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( elsubrutinib and/or upadacitinib ).  
For concomitant immunosuppressive agent(s) (i.e., MTX , azathioprine, mycophenolate, leflunomid e, 
etc.) that have been prescribed per standard of care prior to study entry and are allowed to be 
continued during the study, contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant 
immunosuppressive agent(s).  The duration of contraception after discontinuation of these 
immunosuppressive agent(s) should be based on the local product labelling.  Urine pregnancy testing 
shall be performed at monthly intervals in the study activity schedule.
Additional local requirements may apply and should be followed accordingly.

or more treatment groups), at any site.  The study may be discontinued or terminated in case of an 
unacceptable risk, relevant toxicity, or a negative change in the benefit/risk assessment including the 
occurrence of AEs of which the character, severity, or frequency is new in comparison to the existing risk 
profile. In addition, data deriving from other clinical trials or toxicological studies which negatively 
influence the benefit/risk assessment might cause discontinuation or termination of the study.   In the 
event the study is partially terminated, all subjects in the terminated arm(s) will be as ked to return for a 
PD visit and to perform a [ADDRESS_570625] dose of study drug.  These subjects 
are not eligible for the LTE Study M20 -186.  The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if 
he/she has safety concerns.  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will promptly 
notify the investigator.

should be advised on the continued s cientific importance of their data even if they discontinue 
treatment with study drug early.
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation
During the study, subjects may discontinue study drug treatment but may choose to continue to
participate in the study.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should complete a PD visit as 
soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks.  Afterwards, subjects should follow the regular visit 
schedule as outlined in Appendix D and Section 2.1 of the Operations Manual, and adhere to all study

STUDY M19 -130  |   Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_570627] no longer wants to provide 
assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study drug, a second PD visit 
is not required.  Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment are not eligible for the LTE 
Study M20 -186.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent)
Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for any reason at 
any time.  If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), 
the procedures outlined for the PD visit should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_570628] dose of study dru g may be completed to ensure all 
treatment -emergent AEs/SAE s have been resolved .
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obt ain 
information on the subject 's final status.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_570629] 's source documentation.
If a subject withdraws from study follow up or withdraws permission for t he collection of their personal 
data, the study staff may still use available public records to obtain information about survival status 
only, as appropriate per local regulations.
Inthe event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue 
unless the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped.  When [COMPANY_013] is informed that samples are 
withdrawn from research, samples will not be analyzed, no new biomarker analysis data will be 
collected, and the samples will b e destroyed.  Data generated from biomarker research, before subject 
withdrawal of consent, will remain part of the study results.
5.7 Study Drug
Elsubrutinib , upadacitinib, or matching placebo manufactured by [CONTACT_26282] ( Table 2) will be administered 
on Day 1 (Baseline) and should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  Subjects will be 
instructed to take study drug sorally, which includes only [ADDRESS_570630] will be instructed to return all 
drug containers (even if empty) to t he study site personnel at each study visit.  Study site personnel will 
document compliance.

5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
Approximately 325 subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 
5treatment groups:
Group 1:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg QD and upadacitinib 30 mg QD (n = 65)
Group 2:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg QD and upadacitinib 15 mg QD (n = 65)
Group 3:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg QD and upadacitinib placebo QD (n = 65)
Group 4:  Elsubrutinib placebo QD and upadacitinib 30 mg QD (n = 65)
Group 5:  Elsubrutinib placebo QD and upadacitinib placebo QD (n = 65)
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_17186].  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_66770] 33 of 114 
  
STUDY M19 -130  |   Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_570632] 's treatment group 
assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_66771].
Randomization will be stratified based on the following fa ctors:
Baseline corticosteroid dose above 10 mg prednisone -equivalent ( ≤10 mg or > 10 mg)
Screening SLEDAI- 2K (< 10 or ≥ 10).
High vslow vs not applicable IFN score (approximately 80% high)
This stratification factor does not apply to subjects in China.
Baseline immunosuppressant (azathioprine, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, MTX , mycophenolate , or 
leflunomide ) (yes/no)
Once approximately 20% of total subjects have been randomized who are IFN signature [CONTACT_6398], further 
enrollment of such subjects may be suspended.  Please refer to rationale in Section 3.7.
The investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject 's treatment 
throughout the study.  [COMPANY_013] personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the 
trial (with the exception of [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply Management Team) will remain blinded through 
Week [ADDRESS_570633] tr ansaction, which is available to the Investigator.  If the IRT system is 
unavailable, unblinding may occur by [CONTACT_448383] (preferred) 
or email ([EMAIL_2197]).  For country -specific phone numbers, p lease see the following 
website:  http://www.endpointclinical.com/help -desk/.  In the event that the blind is broken before 
notification to the [COMPANY_013] TA MD, we request that the [COMPANY_013] TA MD be notified within [ADDRESS_570634] be recorded in the source 
documents and electronic case report form ( eCRF ), as applicable.
5.9 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. The investigator is responsible for complying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, i ncluding those that may be due to the COVID -19 pandemic ), 
the investigator is responsible for notifying independent ethics committee (IEC)/independent review 
board (IRB), regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].

When needed, high -level unblinded efficacy data may also be requested by [CONTACT_448384] /risk of any emerging safety differences.  A separate DMC charter will be 
prepared outside of the protocol before the first subject is enrolled in the study and will describe the 
roles and responsibilities of the DMC members , frequency of data reviews, relevant safety data to be 
assessed, and expectations for blinded communications.  Communications from the DMC to the study 
team will not contain information that could potentially unblind the study team to subject treatment 
assignments.
[COMPANY_013] utilizes a n internal DMC charter template which closely follows that used for external DMCs and 
applies the same rigor describing DMC roles and responsibilities, DMC procedures ,and the maintenance 
of data integrity.  Each internal DMC wi ll be appropriately constituted with DMC members who have 
relevant expertise in SLE and have no involvement in the development of compound(s) that are the 
subject of the study to ensure objective decision making.  Specifically, all DMC members of 
Study M19 -130 will be well-versed in safety aspects of drug development with years of experience in the 
pharmaceutical industry.  As described in the DMC charter for Study M19 -130, the DMC 's sole remit is to 
safeguard the interests of trial subjects and make recommendations regarding study continuation, study 
modification, or study termination.
6SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
6.[ADDRESS_570636]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Co mplaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Page 35 of 114 
  
STUDY M19 -130  |   Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_570637] and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study site 's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during 
the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the us e of the 
product.
Such an event can result from the use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol, as well as from 
accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre -existing 
condition or illness is considered an AE .  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a 
new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result 
in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, mee t protocol- specific 
criteria (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity management), and/or the investigator considers them to be 
AEs.   Worsening SLE includin g flares will be captured and analyzed via the disease activity forms (SLEDAI, 
BILAG, CLASI, and SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index) and will be analyzed as part of efficacy.  As such, 
worsening SLE and flares will not be captured as AEs unless they result in serio us outcomes.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been 
pre-planned prior to study entry.  Elective surgery is not permitted during the study until the primary 
endpoint has been assessed.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during 
the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for 
which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be con sidered an AE.  If the subject undergoes 
elective surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at least [ADDRESS_570638] undergo emergency surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at the time of the 
surgery.  For both elective and emergency surgery, allow reintroduction of study drug once the physician 
has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection.
If any of the following events are reported ( Table 3), then the following supplemental report must be 
completed.
Page 36 of 114 
  
STUDY M19 -130  |   Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_570639] (AESI) will be monitored during the study:
Serious infecti ons
Opportunistic infections
Herpes zoster
Active TB
Malignancy (all types)
Adjudicated GI perforations
Adjudicated cardiovascular events (e.g, M ACE)
Anemia
Neutropenia
Lymphopenia
Renal dysfunction
Hepatic disorders
Adjudicated embolic and thrombotic events (non -cardiac, non -CNS) including venous 
thromboembolic events defined as pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis .
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
Investigators will rate the severity of each AE acco rding to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5, which can be accessed at:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcae_v5_quick_reference_
8.5x11.pdf.
If no specific grading criteria are provided for the reported event, then the event should be as follows:
Mild (Grade 1):  asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated;
Moderate (Grade 2):  minimal, local or n oninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) (instrumental ADL refer to preparing 
meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.);
Severe (Grade 3 -5):
Grade 3:  severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self- care ADL 
(self- care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the to ilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden);

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Grade 4:  Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated;
Grade 5:  Death related to AE.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of stu dy 
drug:
Reasonable Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.
No Reas onable Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
For causality asse ssments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the 
study drug will be considered "associated."   Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "not associated. "  In addition, when the investigator has not 
reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator' s opi[INVESTIGATOR_110966], an
"Other "cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_111001].
In Japan, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_448362].
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_570640] be 
discontinued from study drug (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of 
a study subject, information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject 's partner during the study, written informed consent 
from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information.  [COMPANY_013] will provide a 
separate consent form for this purpose.  Pregnancy in a subject 's partner will be collected from the date 
of the first dose through [ADDRESS_570641] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.
6.2 Toxicity Management
The toxicity management of the AEs including AESI consists of safety monitoring (review of AEs on an 
ongoing basis, and periodic/ad hoc unblinded review of safety issues by [CONTACT_448385]), 
interruption of study drug dosing with appropri ate clinical management if applicable, and 
discontinuation of the subjects from study drug.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is discussed below and described in Table 4.  
This includes AEs of serious infections, opportunistic infections, GI perforations, cardiovascular events 
(MACE), thromboembolic events, malignancies, and ECG abnormalities.  This also includes the following 
laboratory abnormaliti es:  hemoglobin, ANC , platelet count, ALT or AST, serum creatinine, CPK, 
lymphocyte count, total white blood cell (WBC) count, and urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) .
For all other AEs or laboratory -related AEs, study drug will be interrupted immedia tely if a subject 
experiences a confirmed severe (Grade 3) clinical AE or SAE for which the investigator considers the 
relationship to the study drug to be a reasonable possibility.  For confirmed Grade [ADDRESS_570642] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 
1business day of the study site 's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion .
All follow -up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and 
docum ented in source as required by [CONTACT_1034].  Product complaints associated with AEs will be 
reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Management of Serious Infections
Subjects should be closely monitored fo r the development of signs and symptoms of infection during 
and after treatment with study drug.  Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious 
infection (including COVID -19)or a serious opportunistic infection (excludes non -serious oro pharyngeal 
candidiasis).  A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As appropriate, 
antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the sub ject should be closely monitored.  Study drug may 
be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated.  Subjects who develop active or latent TB 
must be discontinued from the study drug.  
Canada only:  Investigators should be advised to follow local public health guidelines in order to prevent 
subjects enrolled in these trials from acquiring TB.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study drug in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19. Consider 
interrupting study drug in subjects with signs and/or sympt oms and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_166489] -19.  The

Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated 
appropriately.  If the diagnosis of deep ve in thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or non -cardiac, 
non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities
For any given laboratory abnormality, the investigator should assess the subject and apply the standard 
of care for medical evaluation and treatment following any local guidelines.  Specific toxicity 
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values are described in Table 4and may require a 
supplemental eCRF to be completed (see Section 6.1Complaints and Adverse Events).  All abnormal

efficacy and baseline analysis.
The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug.  For the 
Safety Analysis Set, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually 
received, regardless of the treatment randomi zed.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
Primary Endpoint Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint, the achievement of SRI -4 and steroid dose ≤ 10 mg prednisone
equivalent QD at Week 24, will be assessed for each active treatment group vsthe placebo group.  T he 
treatment difference will be evaluated using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by
[CONTACT_188207].  ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination treatment 
groups will be compared to placebo and the monotherapy treatment groups .  Additional comparisons or 
analyses will be conducted as appropriate.  There will be no multiplicity adjustment for the multiple 
comparison s.
The Week [ADDRESS_570649] 
completed all study assessments including the 30 -day follow -up phone call.
Non-Responder Imputation while incorporating Multiple Imputation to handle missing data due to 
COVID -19 (NRI -C)will be applied for primary endpoint analysis.  As observed (AO) analysis will be 
performed as the sensitivity analysis for theprimary endpoint.
Secondary and Additional Endpoint Analysis
All secondary and additional efficacy endpoints described in Section 3.3and Section 3.4will be analyzed 
as follows:
Categorical variables will be tabulated by [CONTACT_448391].  Between -treatment group 
comparison will be evaluated in the same way as the primary endpoint analysis.
All continuous endpoints will be evaluated through the change from Baseline.  For continuous endpoints 
with multiple post -Baseline visits, the treatment effect will be assessed through Mixed- effect Model 
Repeated Measures (MMRM) with treatment, visit and t reatment -by-visit interaction, main stratification 
factors, and the continuous fixed covariate of baseline measurement.  An unstructured variance 
covariance matrix will be used.  For continuous endpoints with single post -Baseline visit analysis, the

STUDY M19 -130  |   Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_570650] dev iation, median, minimum ,and maximum.
For the count endpoints (e.g., number of flares), negative binomial regression model will be used to 
assess treatment effect with treatment, visit, and stratification factors as covariates.
The Cox Proportional Hazard s model will be used to assess the treatment effect for the time -to-event 
endpoint, i.e., time to flare.
Missing Data Imputation Definition
Censoring:   For the time -to-event endpoint, i.e., time to flare, missing data will be considered as 
censored at the last available time for the information.
NRI-C:  The NRI-Cwill categorize any subject who does not have an evaluation during a pre -specified 
visit window as a non- responder for the visit, except for missing data due to COVID -19 infection or 
logistical res triction, which will be handled by [CONTACT_448392].   In addition, subjects who 
prematurely discontinue from study drug will be considered as non- responders for all subsequent visits 
after discontinuation.   Subjects will also be classified as non -respon ders as described in Section 5.4.
As Observed:   As observed analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, and thus a subject 
who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the AO analysis for that visit.  
Regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug, all observed data will be used in the analysis .  As 
observed analysis may be used for both categorical variables and continuous variables for sensitivity 
analysis.
Mixed -Effect Model Repeated Measurements: MMRM analysis will be conducted using amixed -effect 
model for continuous variables .  Data collected after study drug discontinuation or initiation of resc ue 
treatment will not be included.   The mixed model includes the categorical fixed effects of treatment, 
visit and treatment -by-visit interaction, main stratification factors, and the continuous fixed covariate of 
baseline measurement.  An unstructured var iance covariance matrix will be used.  The parameter 
estimations are based on the assumption of data being missing at random and using the method of 
restricted maximum likelihood ( REML).
7.[ADDRESS_570651] 1dose of study drug.  Subjects will be grouped to the treatment actually received.  Safety will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_2695], physical examination, l aboratory assessments, ECGs, and vital signs.  Frequency tables 
and lists of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by [CONTACT_448393] (MedDRA ®) dictionary, by [CONTACT_9313], by [CONTACT_448394], 
and by [CONTACT_448395].  The changes from 
Baseline in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed in a 
descriptive manner.  Shift of labo ratory values from Baseline to defined time points will be tabulated.  
Pre-treatment AEs will be summarized separately.
Page 47 of 114 
  
STUDY M19 -130  |   Version 7.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_570652] dose of study drug administration.  The number and percentages of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs will be tabulated using the MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. Summaries 
(including percentages and event per 100 patient -year) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation, 
and AESI will be provided as well.  For selected laboratory and vital signs parameters, mean change from 
Baseline and percentage of subject swith evaluations meeting pre -defined criteria for Potentially 
Clinically Important values will be summarized.
7.5 Interim Analysis
A planned unblinded interim analysis was performed when 50% of the planned subjects completed their 
Week 24 assessments.  The obj ective of this analysis was to reassess the treatment regimens in Study 
M19 -130 and the benefit/risk for rollover into LTE Study M20 -186. 
The interim analysis was performed by [CONTACT_448396].  The M19 -130 study team will remain blinded through the Week 24 Primary 
Analysis. 
An Interim Unblinding Plan (IUP) was developed separately describing the analyses to be performed and 
included execution logistics, an unblinded analysis team, and th e data chain of custody to protect the 
integrity of the study.  
An Internal Executive Review Committee (IERC) reviewed the interim unblinded results as specified in 
the IERC charter and decided which treatment group(s) should be continued in Study M19 -130 and for 
rollover into LTE Study M20 -186.  
Study sites and subjects remained blinded to treatment assignment in Study M19 -130 and 
LTEStudy M20 -186 throughout the studies.  
7.6 Overall Type I Error Control
All tests will be performed as pairwise comparison a t a 2 -sided statistical significance level of α = 0.1.  No 
multiplicity adjustment will be applied because this is a Phase 2 study.
7.7 Sample Size Estimation
The planned sample size for this study is 325 subjects in total, with 65 subjects for each of the 5 groups , 
determined based on the primary endpoint, the composite of SRI -4 and steroid dose ≤ 10 mg 
prednisone equivalent QD at Week 24.  Assuming at Week 24 the placebo response rate is 25%, a 
two-sided χ2test with α= 10% will provide 78% to 91% power to detect a difference of 20% to 25% 
between an active treatment group and the placebo group.

Screening Period
Within 42 days prior to the Baseline visit, subjects will receive a full explanation of the study design and 
study procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the screening procedures outlined 
in the Activity Schedule in Protocol Appendix D.  With the exception of the QuantiFER ON TB-Gold and
purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) tests (requirements outlined in Section 3.13 ), otherwise exclusionary 
laboratory values can be re -tested once during the screening period.  If the re -tested lab value(s) 
remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure.  Redrawing samples if previous 
samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since previous result was never 
obtained.
Re-Screening
Subjects who initially screen- fail for the study are permitted to be re -screened once following reconsent.  
For additional re -screening, [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD)/Scientific Director 
approval is requ ired.  All screening procedures, with the exceptions noted below, will be repeated 
during re -screening.  The subject must meet all of the eligibility criteria at the time of re -screening in 
order to qualify for the study.  There is no minimum period of time that a subject must wait to re -screen 
for the study , except for the SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_570682] be screen failed and may only 
re-screen after they meet the following SARS -CoV-2 infection viral clearance criteria: 
At least [ADDRESS_570683] (e.g., PCR) result have passed in asymptomatic subjects 
or 14 days since onset of signs/symptoms, defined as resolution of fever without use of 
antipyretics and improvement in s ymptoms. 
If the subject had an initial screening evaluation including the following assessments, the below tests 
will not be required to be repeated for re -screening, provided the conditions noted in Protocol 
Section 5.1 (Eligibility Criteria) are met, there are no changes in the subject's medical history that 
warrant re -testing, and no more than [ADDRESS_570684] passed:
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV) , and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
serology
Interferon (IFN) -Gamma Release Assay (IGR A; QuantiFERON Tuberculosis [TB] Gold In -Tube test 
or equivalent) and/or a [COMPANY_003] test (or both if required per local guidelines)
Interferon signature, antinuclear antibody (ANA) test/anti -Smith Antibody (Ab)
Immunoglobulin G ( IgG), immunoglobulin M ( IgM)
Cotinine measurement
Chest x -ray ( CXR)
Electrocardiogram ( ECG)
Page [ADDRESS_570685] Information and Informed Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer 
all questions regarding this study.  Prior to a ny study -related screening procedures being performed on 
the subject or any medications being discontinued by [CONTACT_17204], 
the informed consent statement will be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_448400], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other 
signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the 
subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in 
the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any 
study -related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding benefits for subject s and information regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in 
the informed consent form.
3.2 Medical History and Prior/Concomitant Medications
A complete list of prior/concomitant medications and medical history including demographics, history of 
tobacco (e.g., smoking and/or vaporizing or other routes of administration or nicotine substitutes), 
alcohol, and drug use will be taken at Screening.  The subject's prior/concomitant medications and 
medical history, including history of herpes zoster vaccination (and the name [CONTACT_448419]) will 
be updated at the Study Day [ADDRESS_570686]
Please refer to Section 4for adverse events (AEs) and Section [ADDRESS_570687] (AESI).
3.4 Skin Photographs
Subjects with rash at Screening, considered by [CONTACT_448401] (SLE), should have photographs taken at Screening for adjudication.  For those subjects 
who have confirmed (by [CONTACT_448402]) Lupus rash at screening, photographs will also be taken at 
Week 24.  Subject must voluntarily provide consent, approved by [CONTACT_448403]/independent ethics committee ( IRB/IEC ), after the nature of the skin photographs has been 
explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  If the subject presents with a rash 
requiring adjudication at Screening, the subject must consent to skin photographs or they will not be 
allowed to participate in the study.  Subjects who agr ee to skin photographs are consenting to 
photographs at Screening and at Week 24 (for those who have confirmed Lupus rash by [CONTACT_73485]).

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].3.5 Patient -Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete the self -administered patient -reported outcome ( PRO )instruments (w hen 
allowed per local regulatory guidelines).  Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions 
provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel 
shall not provide interpretation or assistance to s ubjects other than encouragement to complete the 
tasks.  Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits and will ensure 
that a response is entered for all items.
The PRO instrument should be completed prior to drug admin istration on Day [ADDRESS_570688]'s response.
LupusQoL
The Lupus Quality of Life questionnaire (LupusQoL) is a disease -specific health -related quality of life 
(HRQoL) PRO instrument.  It has 8domains including physical health, emotional health, body image, 
pain , planning, fatigue, intimate relationships ,and burden on others .  Item responses are based on a 
5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ="All the time" to 4 = "Never."   These 8 domains are measured via 
34items and are scored separately.  Scores range from 0 (worst HRQoL) to 100 (best HRQoL) .
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT )-Fatigue
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) system is a collection of quality of life 
(QoL) questionnaires targeted to the management of cancer and other chronic illnesses.  The 
FACIT -Fatigue questionnaire was developed to assess fatigue associated with anemia.  It consists of 
13fatigue -related questions.  The responses to the 13 items on the FACIT -Fatigue questionnaire are 
each measured on a 5-point Likert scale.  The responses to the answers are the following:  (i) not at all:  
0points; (ii) a little bit:  1 point; (iii) somewhat:  2 points; (iv) quite a bit:  3 points; (v) very much:  
4points.  Items a re summed, and reverse scored when appropriate, to provide a total score ranging
from 0 to 52 , where higher scores represent better QoL .  
SF-36
The SF- 36v2 is a general health -related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument with extensive use in multiple 
disease states.  The SF- 36v2 instrument comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a subject's 
functional health and well -being in 8 dimensions (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general 
health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional ,and mental health).  Scoring is totaled into a Physical 
Component Summary and a Mental Component Summary.  Higher SF -36v2 scores indicate a better state 
of health.  
Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGA)
The PtGA is a single -item assessment in which subjects are asked to rate the overall effect that lupus has 
on them at the time the assessment is completed.  The PtGA is a visual analog scale with scores ranging 
from 0 to 100 and high scores indicating greater disease activity.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)
The pain NRS is a single -item questionnaire in which subjects are asked to rate the overall pain level.  
The pain NRS scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a higher level of pain.
3.6 Pharmacokinetic Sampling
Starting 3 da ys prior to each clinical site visit, subjects are advised to take the study drug dose at the 
time that matches their scheduled visit time at the clinical site.  Following the clinical visit, subjects may 
continue taking study drug dose according to their regular schedule.
On the day of the study visit, subjects will take their dose of study drug at the clinical site and 1 blood 
sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments should be collected within specified time intervals at each 
visit below as follows:
At Baseline, between 0.5 and 2 hours following dosing;
At Week 4, between 2 and 6 hours following dosing;
At Week 12, pre- dose;
At Week 20, between 0.5 and 2 hours following dosing; and
At Week 24, between 2 and 6 hours following dosing;
Premature Discontinuation (PD) , at any time during the visit.
3.7 Biomarker Research Sampling
Blood samples will be collected for biomarker research.  Refer to Section 2.1for the schedule of 
biomarker research sample collections.  All biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as 
outlined in the study -specific laboratory manual.  [COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) 
will use and store the samp les and data in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect 
confidentiality.  The samples may be retained while research on elsubrutinib ( ABBV -105), upadacitinib
(ABT -494) , ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination (or drugs of this cla ss),or SLE and related 
conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirement. 
Whole blood for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) Y223 phosphorylation assay will be collected twice at 
Baseline, pre -dose and pos t-dose collection.  This biomarker will also have Week 12, Week 24 ,and PD
visits collection.  The collection window at Baseline (post -dose only), Week 12 (pre -dose), Week 24 
(post -dose), and at PDvisits should be the same as collection of blood samples f or PK assessment. 
At select study sites, whole blood for BTK occupancy will be collected twice at Baseline, pre -dose and 
post -dose collection.  This biomarker will also have Week 12, Week 24 ,and at PDvisits collection (in a 
subset of sites/subjects).  The collection window at Baseline (post -dose only), Week 12 (pre -dose), 
Week 24 (post -dose), and at PDvisits should be the same as collection of blood samples for PK 
assessment.

3.8 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in 
Section 2.1.  The ECG shoul d be performed prior to blood collection.
The ECGs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_41596] ("local reader").  The local 
reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a
written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
Normal ECG
Abnormal ECG –not clinically significant
Abnormal ECG –clinically significant
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's sour ce 
folder.  The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine -generated measurements and interpretation that 
are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
ECGs with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's correction formul a (QTcF) should be 
reported (or calculated) and documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the 
appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) if QTcF prolongation is observed.
A valid QTcF cannot be calculated in subjects who have a pac emaker or supraventricular or ventricular 
conduction abnormalities.  In cases of QTcF prolongation, the baseline QTcF will need to be entered into 
the appropriate eCRF for comparison as well.  In addition, any clinically significant findings will be 
docume nted in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.  Each signed 
original ECG will be monitored by [CONTACT_448404] a subject's source 
documents onsite.
Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].

Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
body temperature will be obtained at visits as specified in Section 2.1.  Blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_448363] a fter the subject has been sitting for at least [ADDRESS_570690]'s medical history, will be captured on 
the appropriate eCRF page.
At any time, a symptom -directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].
Chest x -ray (CXR)
A CXR (posterior- anterior and lateral views) is required for all subjects at Screening to rule out the 
presence of TB or other clinically relevant findings.  The CXR will not be required if the subject had a 
previous normal CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the 
chest within [ADDRESS_570691]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  A 
radiologist or pulmonologist must perform and document an assessment of the CXR at Screening (If 
allowed per local regulatio n, a qualified physician can perform and document an assessment of the CXR 
at Screening.).  The Principal Investigator (PI)will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will 
sign and date the report.  In the assessment of the CXR, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_448364] (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active 
TB.  If the CXR or prior chest CT scan demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified 
nodule, fi brotic scar, api[INVESTIGATOR_110962]) or other findings that are clinically significant, 
the PI[INVESTIGATOR_110963].
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any time during the study as warranted based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].
TBrisk assessment 
Done at Screening only (see Section 3.13 for more information about TB testing and Appendix B).
Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PhGA)
The physician will rate global assessment of the subject's current disease activity, ranging from [ADDRESS_570692]'s self -assessment using the visual analogue scale, which consists of a 
horizontal 3 -inch line anchored at either end by [CONTACT_51022]/severity of 
the parameters assessed at visits specified in Sec tion 2.1.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Swollen and Tender Joint Count Assessment
An assessment of 28 joints will be done by [CONTACT_448405] 2.1.  Joint swelling will be classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9"), or no 
assessment ("NA").  Joint tenderness will additionally be classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), 
replaced ("9"), or "NA."
Any injected joints will be considered as "not assessed" ("NA") for 3 months from the time of the 
intra -articular injection.
If possible, the swollen joint count (SJC) and ten der joint count (TJC) should be performed by [CONTACT_448406]- related procedures.
In order to minimize variability, the same independent joint assessor should evaluate the subject at each 
visit for the duration of the trial as much as possible.  A back -up independent joint assessor should be 
identified.  The independent joint assessors should be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, 
physician's assistant, physician).  Any other joint a ssessor must be trained and competent in performing 
such assessments.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and 
trained to perform joint assessments.  If the independent assessor is not available, the prei dentified 
back -up assessor should perform such assessments.
SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)- 2K assessment
The SLEDAI- 2K is a global index that evaluates disease activity over the previous 30 days and includes 
24items collecting specific manifestations in 9 organ systems:  neurological, musculoskeletal, renal, 
mucocutaneous, general, heart, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], vascular, and hem atological.  The SLEDAI -2K scores all 
active (not merely emerging) rash, alopecia, oral ulcers, and proteinuria, and collects disease a spects as 
present or absent.  Thus, it may not reflect partial improvement.
British Isles Lupus Activity Group (BILAG) assessment 2004
The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004 evaluates specific manifestations over the 
previous four weeks in a total of 8 organs systems, 9 in the revised Index:  constitutional, 
mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal (GI), ophthalmic, 
renal, and hem atological.  Activity in each organ system is scored as:  A = severe disease; B = moderate 
activity; C = mild disease; D = previous involvement, currently inactive; E = no previous activity.  The 
BILAG also is used to evaluate the occurrence of flares in patients with SLE.  A severe flare is defined as a 
score of A, new appearance and a moderate flare is defined with a score of B, and a reoccurrence is 
defined with a score of D or E.
The BILAG -Based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA)
The BILAG-Based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) is acomposite index used in clinical trials.  This 
differs from the SLE Responder Index ( SRI) in that the BILAG -[ADDRESS_570693] meet the following criteria:  BILAG -2004 index 
improvement in all A and B scores, no more than one new BILAG B score, no worsening of the total 
SLEDAI -2K score from Baseline , no significant deterioration (not > 10% worsening) in the 100 mm visual

excludes treatment failures.
Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) assessment
The CLASI is a simple, single -page tool that separately quantifies disease activity and damage.  Each part 
of the body is listed separately, from the scalp to the feet, in addition to sections focusing on mucous 
membrane i nvolvement and alopecia.  Scores for each area are assigned based on the most severe 
lesion within the area of interest.  Of note, affected body parts are weighted equally regardless of 
surface area and number of lesions present.  The selection of these eq ually weighted segments was 
designed to reflect the impact of more common areas of SLE skin involvement.  Unlike the SLEDAI and 
BILAG, interim disease between visits is not accounted for, only the condition on the day of the 
examination.
SELENA SLEDAI Flar e Index assessment
The SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index (SFI), developed by [CONTACT_448407], is a composite outcome of SELENA; 
distinguishing mild/moderate, and severe flares; integrating specific descriptors, medication changes, 
the Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PhGA), and changes in the total SLEDAI score.1
3.12 Dispense Study Drug
Study drug will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline (Day 1) and as specified in Section 2.1.  
The first dose of study drug will be administered after all other Baseline (Day 1) procedures are 
completed.  At the visits specified in Section 2.1, the site personnel will review and retain a copy of the 
subject dosing diary, review returned study drug kits, and empty study drug packaging to verify 
compliance.
Elsubrutinib capsules, upa dacitinib tablets, and matching placebo capsules and tablets should be dosed 
together at approximately the same time each day and taken with or without food.
3.[ADDRESS_570694] prior 
to study drug intake (with the exception of the Screening visit, which may be nonfasting).  Subjects 
whose visits occur prior to the morning dose of study drug should be instructed to fast after midnight 
until the blood sampl e is collected in the morning and thereafter take their study drug with food.  
Subjects whose visits occur after the morning dose of study drug should be instructed to fast after 
breakfast until the study visit occurs.  At the Study Day [ADDRESS_570695] value is outside the reference range and the investigator considers the laboratory 
result to be clinically significant, the investigator will:
repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value;
follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resoluti on; or
discontinue the subject from study drug or require the subject to receive treatment; in this case, 
the laboratory result will be recorded as an AE.
If renal and hematological laboratory results required for physician indices are not available (e.g. , 
specimen hemolyzed, specimen lost in transit, specimen received beyond stability, etc.), re -draw should 
occur within 7 days of notification from Labcorp Drug Development that results are unavailable.

Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at all sche duled visits.  An at -home pregnancy test is required if 
a scheduled study visit is missed.  The results of at -home testing must be communicated to the site.  
More frequent pregnancy tests can be performed throughout the study at the investigator's discreti on

Unless a woman is suspected to have become pregnant, additional pregnancy testing beyond 
the monthly testing during the clinical trial is not required.
At each visit, the study staff should review the pregn ancy avoidance recommendations with each female 
of childbearing potential and document this discussion in the subject's source records.
Clinical Chemistry
A minimum [ADDRESS_570698] when necessary due to unforeseen circumstances, the nonfasting status will be recorded in 
study source documentation.
Urinalysis
Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by [CONTACT_17206].  Specified abnormal 
mac roscopic urinalyses defined as leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative, 
or glucose greater than normal will be followed up with a microscopic analysis at the central laboratory.
TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis
The TB screening tests provide diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the subject's 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], history, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine if a 
subject has previous, active, or latent TB.  Expert consultati on for the evaluation and/or management of 
TB may be considered per investigator discretion.
At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk assessment form 
(see Appendix B) and tested for TB infection by [CONTACT_82736]- TB Gold test.  The [COMPANY_003] skin test should be 
utilized only when a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are 
required per local guidelines).  IGRA equivalent test may be used as available and if compliant with local 
TB guidelines.  The site staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an 
appropriate eCRF.
If a subject had a negative Qua ntiFERON -TB Gold (and/or [COMPANY_003]) test (or IGRA equivalent such as 
T-SPOT .TB test) within [ADDRESS_570699]'s medical history to warrant a 
repeat test.  These cases may be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.  The results of the TB test(s) will be 
retained at the site as the original source documentation.
Subjects with a negative TB test and CXR not suggestive of active TB or prior TB e xposure may be 
enrolled.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB or latent TB, including signs 
and symptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a CXR not suggestive of active TB may 
be enrolled if the subjec t has documentation of a full course of prophylaxis (at least 6 months of 
treatment with isoniazid per investigator discretion based on local guidelines) or treatment for TB .  
Subjects with a prior history of latent TB who have documented completion of a f ull course of anti -TB 
therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history 
to warrant repeat treatment.  If documentation of a full course prophylaxis or treatment for TB is not 
available, the subject should be excluded from the study and be referred to a physician for evaluation 
and treatment.
Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled.
Any newly positive TB screen after the subject has started the study should be reported as an AE of 
latent TB or active TB (as applicable), and subject must be discontinued from the study drug.
TB Testing
Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test (or 
equivalent) and/or [COMPANY_003] are not required to repeat either test at Screeni ng and should be 
considered positive.
For regions that require both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON- TB Gold testing, both will be performed.  If 
either [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON -TB Gold tests are positive, the TB test is considered positive.
The [COMPANY_003] Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) should be utilized only when a 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per 
local guidelines).
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test and 
the [COMPANY_003] are required per local guidelines), the [COMPANY_003] will be performed.  The [COMPANY_003] should be read 
by a licensed healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_570700].  The 
reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration, and induration ≥ 5 mm is 
considered a positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not 
"negative."  Subjects who have had an ulcer ating reaction to the [COMPANY_003] in the past should not be 
re-exposed, and the [COMPANY_003] should be considered positive.
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a local 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or through the central labor atory if not locally available) to rule out 
a positive test result.  If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is 
considered to be positive for the purpose of this study.  If the testing result is negative, then the 
subject is consi dered to be negative.

Gold Plus test by [CONTACT_320139] (i.e., no risk factors id entified using the Part I and Part II questions of the TB risk 
assessment questionnaire at Screening) and has no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_110958], the investigator may 
perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory 
if not locally available) to confirm the positive test result.  If the repeat testing result is negative, 
the investigator may consider the test to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if the 
repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, t he test is considered positive.
If different national regulations exist for screening for latent TB while being on 
immunosuppressive treatment, these national regulations will be applied, respectively.
Hepatitis Screen
All subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV and HCV at Screening.
Hepatitis B Virus:
Subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV at Screening using the following tests:
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag)
Hepatitis B core antibody (HBc Ab/anti -HBc)
Hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBs Ab/anti -HBs)
A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary.
A negative result for HBs Ag will trigger automatic reflex testing for core antibodies (HBc Ab) and surface 
antibodies (HBs Ab).
A negative test result for HBc Ab does not require HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing, and the 
subject may be enrolled ( Figure 1, Scenarios A and B).
For a subject who has had an HBV vaccination (should document in the medical hi story), a 
positive test result for HBs Ab is expected.  The HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing is not required, 
and the subject may be enrolled ( Figure 1, Scenario B).*
A positive test result for HBc Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic reflex testing) 
(Figure 1, Scenarios C and D).
A result that exceeds detection sensitivity by [CONTACT_110999] a positive 
result for HBV DNA and will be exclusionary.
A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may be enrolled.
Where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]:  A positive result for HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR 
testing.
A result that exceeds detection sensitivity by [CONTACT_110999] a positive 
result for HBV DNA and will be exclusionary.
A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may be enrolled.

of HB V vaccination (and for subjects in Japan and China or where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]), a positive result for 
HBs Ab/anti -HBs requires HBV DNA PCR testing.
Hepatitis C Virus
Blood samples for HCV serology will be obtained at the Screening visit.  A positive HCV Ab will trigger a n
HCV RNA test.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate active 
hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti HCV Ab).

Subjects with HIV infection (positive HIV test) are e xcluded from study participation.  HIV testing will be 
performed at Screening, unless prohibited by [CONTACT_427].  The investigator must discuss any local 
reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject.  The site will report confirme d positive 
results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary.  If a subject has a confirmed positive 
result, the investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health, 
and subject should receive or b e referred for clinical care promptly.  
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations, or changes in shippi[INVESTIGATOR_448365] 2019 ( COVID -19)pandemic prevent the subject from having blood drawn and 
analyzed for laboratory testing at the study site, if possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory work 
done at a local lab, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or other facility.  Local lab results should be obtained a long with reference 
ranges and kept within the subjects 'source documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_23995].
If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration may be continued for [ADDRESS_570702]'s 
condition.  Following discontinuati on of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the 
investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue 
participation in the study.

4.1 Methods and Timing of Safety Assessment
Allserious and nonserious AEs which could be related to study procedures (e.g., infection at blood draw 
site, done during Screening) will be co llected from the time the subject signed the study -specific 
informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug administration until 
30days after discontinuation of study treatment, all AEs and SAEs will be collected whether sol icited or 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  After [ADDRESS_570704] -Treatment Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious 
AEs will not be collected).
4.2 Recording Data an d Analyses of Safety Findings
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The 
number and percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs; i.e., any event that 
begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug through [ADDRESS_570705] -study drug dosing) will 
be tabulated by [CONTACT_448409] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) and compared 
between arms using Fisher's exact test.  The tabulation of the number of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_448410].  Subjects reporting more than [ADDRESS_570706] related according to the relationship to study drug tables.  Subjects 
reporting more than 1 type of event within an SOC will be counted only once for that SOC.
4.3 Reporting Adverse Events and Intercurrent Illne sses
In the event of a serious adverse event (SAE ), whether associated with study drug or not, the 
investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_570707]® system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented on the SAE 
nonCRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of 
the site being made aware of the SAE.

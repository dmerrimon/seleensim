Study Title
A Phase 2, Multicenter, International, Single Arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of 
Single Agent CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine) in Previous ly Treated Subjects With Locally Advanced 
or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Indication
Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with an 
undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma, who have previously progressed clinically or radiographically on 1 to 2 previous regimens including platinum-based chemotherapy.
Objectives
Primary Objectives:
To evaluate the efficacy of CC-486 in subjects with NPC
Secondary Objectives:
To evaluate safety in all subjects and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CC-486 in a subset of subjects of 
Asian-Pacific Island ethnicity at experienced selected sites
Exploratory Objective:
 
Study Design
This is a Phase 2, single arm, multicenter, international study to assess the safety and efficacy of 
single agent CC-486 in previously tr eated subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NPC, 
having previously failed one to two previous  regimens, including a platinum-based 
chemotherapy.
Approximately 51 to 55 subjects will be enro lled acc ording to a Simon two-stage design; if the 
predefined activity is met (> 4 responses [com plete response/partial response {CR/PR}] out of 
the first 17 evaluable subjects based on independent  radiological assessment), then the study will 
continue to enroll an additional 34 subjects. If ≤ [ADDRESS_78653] imated median

CC-486-NPC-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 7 CC-486-NPC-001 Final: 11 July 2014All subjects will be followed for safety and monit oring of adverse events (AEs) for [ADDRESS_78655] (IP), for response until progression (if applicable), and for 
new anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72591], or the End of 
Trial, whichever occurs earlier.
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for 
primary, secondary, and/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol and/or the Statistical Analysis Plan, whichever is the later date.
Study Treatments
Subjects will receive the investigational produ ct (IP) CC-486, administered orally every day 
(QD) on Days 1-[ADDRESS_78656] 6 evaluable for 
safety subjects of Asian-Pacific Island ethnicity, a starting dose of 200 mg will be tested. If there 
are no safety concerns, eg, unexpected AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, or death, the [ADDRESS_78657] refusal, physician decision, or 
death.
Overview of Efficacy Assessments
All subjects will be evaluated for tumor response and progression according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 guidelines at screening and every 6 weeks 
(± 5 days) for the first three tumor evaluation s and then every 9 weeks until documented disease 
progression, start of new anticancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent.
Response assessmen ts will in clude computed tom ography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the head and neck with supraclavicular node imaging, the chest and
abdomen/pelvis, neurological examination with facial nerve evaluation, and bone scans at 
baseline for all subjects. Bone scans will be repeated  only if the subject is symptomatic or with 
known bone metastasis .
In the follow-up phase, anticancer treatment administered following the last dose of IP and survival will be followed every 8 weeks (± 5 days ) until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost-to-
follow up, whichever occurs first.
Overview of Safety Assessments
All subjects will be monitored for adverse events, starting from the time the subject signs the 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) until [ADDRESS_78658] dose of IP. A thorough evaluation of 
medical conditions will be conducted during screening for eligibility. Documented physical 
examination, vital signs, laboratory assessments , (eg, serum chemistry, hematology, including 
Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] – deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status will be monitored regularly ( Oken, 1982 ) see Appendix A.
Preventative measure will be taken to avoid pregna ncy in study subjects or their partners, and 
females of child-bearing potential will have regular pregnancy testing performed. The full schedule of assessments is described in Table 1 and Section 6.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21ry dayy day

Confidential and Propri etary 8 CC-486-NPC-001 Final: 11 July 2014Overview of Statistical Methods
This Phase 2 multicenter, single-arm study is designed to evaluate the overall response rate 
(ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of CC-486 in previous ly treated subjects  with locally 
advanced or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, having received one to two previous 
regimens. A Simon’s optimal two-stage design will be used ( Simon, 1989).
Analysis Population
All safety analyses will be based on th e population of all enro lled s ubjects who received at least 
one dose of IP. All primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be based on the Efficacy 
Evaluable population, wh ich consists of all subjects who meet all eligibility criteria, and
EITHER received at least two cycles of IP at any dose intensity and discontinued treatment for 
progressive disease; OR received at least four cycles of IP at any dose intensity and have 
baseline and at least two post-screening tumor assessments.
Sample Size
The sample size est imation is based on having s ufficient sample in the Efficacy Evaluable 
population to show that the ORR is higher than 20% or median PFS is > 5 months. Simon’s 
optimal two-stage design will be used. In the first stage, 17 subjects will be accrued. If there are 4 or fewer responders within these 17 subjects, enrollment will be stopped. Otherwise 34 
additional subjects will be accrued for a total of 51 subjects. This Phase 2 study will be 
considered positive if more than 14 responders are observed in 51 subjects or the hypothesis of median PFS equal to 5 months is rejected. This design yields a marginal one-sided type I error 
rate of 5% and power of 85% when the true ORR is 40%. After the second stage (n = 51), the power for showing median PFS is > 5 months is 80% (60%) when the true median PFS is about 8 (7) months.
Efficacy Analysis
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the efficacy evaluable population.
The hypothesis testing for the ORR will be based on the exact binomial distribution. Point 
estimate and two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of ORR will be provided. The hypothesis 
testing for the PFS will be based on the exponential distribution. Median PFS, OS, and their two-sided 90% CIs will be provided.
Safety Analysis
Safety and tolerability will be monitored through continuous reporting of AEs and serious 
adverse events (SAEs), laboratory abnormalities , and incidence of subjects experiencing dose 
modifications, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of IP. Data from all subjects who receive one or more doses of IP w ill be included in the safety analyses. Adverse events, 
physical examinations (including vital sign measurements), clinical laboratory information, and 
concomitant medications/procedures will be tabulated.
All adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_35043], severity grade based on the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.0) 
and relationship to treatment. Adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_5379]

common cancer originating in the nasopharynx, which is composed of the upper part of the 
throat (pharynx) behind the nose. The pharynx is composed of three sections: the hypopharynx, 
the oropharynx, and the nasopharynx.
The nasopharynx lies just above the soft palate of the mouth and just in the back of the nasal 
passages, serving as a passageway for air from the nose to the throat and eventually to the lungs. 
Anatomically, it has a cuboidal shape that extends from the base of the skull to the upper surface of the soft palate. The lateral walls are formed by [CONTACT_72621] (a deep recess, aka the pharyngeal recess). Anteriorly, the nasopharynx abuts the 
posterior choana and nasal cavity, and the pos terior boundary is formed by [CONTACT_72622]. 
Above the pharyngeal tonsil, in the midline is the pharyngeal bursa, an irregular flask-shaped 
depression of the mucus membrane.
World Health Organization (WHO) histopathological grading system describes three subtypes of 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma:
1. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma
2. Non-keratinizing differentiated carcinoma
3. Undifferentiated carcinoma (most common subtype)
Each of these subtypes appear more often in some areas of the world than in others. Only about 1 
in seven million people in North America are diagnosed with NPC, and of those diagnosed, 
about 1 in 4 cases are of the keratinizing type ( American Cancer Society, 2013 ). In China, it is 
mostly of the undifferentiated subtype.
NPC is most common in southeast China ( American Cancer Society, 2013 ), and is much more 
common in other parts of Asia, North Africa, the Inuit populations of Alaska and Canada, and 
the Chinese and Hmong immigrant groups in th e [LOCATION_002] (US), than in the general 
population.
Although it is not exactly understood what causes NPC, factors thought to predispose patients to 
this tumor include the presence of the Epstein-B arr virus (EBV), heavy alcohol and tobacco 
intake, a diet rich in salt-cured meats and fish, and a family history of NPC. The EBV appears in 
most NPC cells and is thought to be linke d although not completely elucidated. Patients with 
NPC have high levels of antibodies to EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) and viral nuclear antigens. The presence of these antibodies is thought to precede the development of NPC by 
[CONTACT_72623]. The EBV infection has been s hown to decrease expression of tumor suppressor 
genes, which may help understand the carcinogenesis of NPC. In the clinical setting, EBV 
antibody or circulating viral deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) titers may be useful as a prognostic 
tool at diagnosis, and as a measure of tumor burden during treatment.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21asal sal

Confidential and Propri etary 17 CC-486-NPC-001 Final: 11 July 2014Heavy alcohol and tobacco intake are mostly associated with the keratinizing squamous cell 
carcinoma subtype. NPC also appears to be more common in males than in females, and in 
patients younger than 55 years of age ( American Cancer Society, 2013 ).
Thus, the multifactorial etiology implicates  genetic, viral, and environmental factors.
However, studies have shown that all subtype s derive from the epi[INVESTIGATOR_72592], and many NPCs also contain a high concentration of lymphocytes 
among the cancer cells. The presence of keratin has been associated with reduced local control and survival.
1.2. Diagnosis and Treatment
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma can be asymptomatic for long periods of time, which precludes early diagnosis. In most cases, the diagnosis is made based on locoregional advanced disease symptoms, with cranial nerve involvement or cervical node metastases ( Sham, 1993 ;Sham,
1990). Most patients present with stages III and IV with cervical node involvement at first clinical presentation. The most frequently reported location of metastasis is to bone (70% to 80%), followed by [CONTACT_72624] (liver, 30%; lung, 18%) and, at a decreased rate in axillary, 
mediastinal, pelvic, and inguinal nodes ( Ahmad, 1986).
Standard treatments for patients with NPC incl ude radiation therapy alone, concurrent 
chemoradiation followed by [CONTACT_72625], surgery for residual nodal disease, and chemotherapy alone for metastatic disease. High-dose radiation therapy with chemotherapy is the 
primary treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer, both for the primary tumor site and the neck ( Sham, 
1993).
Selected patients with local recurrence may be retreated with moderate-dose external-b eam 
radiation therapy using intensity-modulated radiati on therapy, stereotactic radiation therapy, or 
intracavitary or interstitial rad iation to the site of recurrence ( Baujat, 2006 ; Mendenhall, 2011 ; 
Vikram, 1985 ).
If a patient has metastatic disease or local recurrence that is no longer amenable to surgery or 
radiation therapy, chemotherapy should be considered ( Koutcher, 2010 ; Al-Sarraf, 1988 ;Jacobs, 
1992).
Therefore, chemotherapy remains an important treatment modality for palliative treatment and 
for metastatic NPC, especially those with a good performance status. Prognosis, especially for 
locally advanced stages (IIB – IVB) and metastatic NPC remains poor: more than a third of cases 
will present with local and/or metastatic recurrence. In the recurrent metastatic disease setting, the median survival a nd progression-free s urvival (PFS) are even shorter, at approximately 8 to 
14 months and 4 to 6 months, respectively. Response rates (RR) range from approximately 14% to 38%. Isolated bone metastasis may be associated with long survival ( Ong, 2003 ). Overall, 5-
year survival for all NPC stages ranges from 50% to 70%. In first-line treatment of metastasis, 
platinum-based doublets, especially that of 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin, is generally 
recommended. In second line treatment of metastasis, the choice of chemotherapy depends on 
the previous treatment. In patients pretreated with platins, there is no established standard; 
reintroduction of platins depending on toxicity and the interval to recurrence: for an interval 
greater than [ADDRESS_78670] effective, with Ov erall Response (OR) 22% to 75%, but with associated ecludes earecludes ea

gemcitabine or docetaxel monochemotherapy is r ecommended in cases of platin resistance (early 
[<6 months] recurrence) or in fragile subjects in whom toxicity could be threatening ( Foo, 2002 ).
However, a review of the literature on clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic NPC show that there is no consensus in second-line therapy or beyond and after progression with platins. 
Monotherapy with gemcitabine, capecitabine or ta xanes has been the most widely tested, with 
acceptable results ( Chan, 2010 ). In older studies, the most often used chemotherapy agents for 
monotherapy were methotrexate, bleomycin, 5- FU, cisplatin and carboplatin, with response rates 
of 15% to 31% ( Bensouda, 2011 ).  There were two Phase 2 studies that focused on metastatic 
NPC with two other drugs:  4-epi[INVESTIGATOR_72593] (a n anthracycline) and mitoxantrone, and the 
observed OR rates were about 20% ( Shiu, 1989 ; Dugan, 1993). In more recent clinical studies, 
other molecules such as gemcitabine, capecitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel and irinotecan have 
been studies in patients pretreated with cisplatin ( Bensouda, 2011 ); gemcitabine and capecitabine 
had OR rates in the range of 23-48% and median survival between 7.2 and 14 months ( Foo, 
2002; Shiu, 1989 ; Ma, 2005 ; Chua, 2003 ; Chua, 2008 ; Ciuleanu, 2008 ; Zhang, 2008 ). The first 
study of weekly docetaxel in monotherapy for NPC was conducted in 2008 and reported similar results with an overall response rate (ORR) o f 37% and median survival of 12.8 months ( Ngeow, 
2011). All of the above-mentioned studies have been Phase 2 studies, mostly for pretreated patients, and for metastatic and recurrent NPC.
1.3. CC-486
5-Azacitidine (AZA), an analog of the pyrimidine nu cleoside cytidine, has effects on cell 
differentiation, gene expression, and DNA synthesis and metabolism, and causes cytotoxicity(Azacitidine Investigator’s Broc hure [IB]).
Vidaza
®(azacitidine injection) is approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for 
5 subtypes of the French-American British (FAB) classification system of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  Vidaza is also approved by [CONTACT_72626], acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and c hronic myeolomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL)
patients who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  Vidaza can be administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) or subcu taneous (SC) routes as designated by [CONTACT_72627].
CC-486 is an orally bioav ailable formulation of AZA.
After its incorporation into a cell’s DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle, AZA forms 
covalent adducts with DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and depletes this enzyme required for 
the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, thereby [CONTACT_72628][INVESTIGATOR_72594].

proteins required for apoptosis, including caspase 8, DAPK and Apaf-1. DNA methylation-based 
silencing can thus contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the transformed state and 
limit the effectiveness of anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
CC-486 entered clinical testing in 2006 in subjects with MDS, CMMoL, and AML. The 
AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 study has shown that CC-486 is bioavailable and a maximal tolerated 
dose (MTD) of 480 mg daily for 7 days was defined based on dose- limiting dia rrhea at 600 mg
(Garcia-Manero, 2011 ).  As expected, reversible and manageable myelosuppression was 
observed.  Pharmacodynamic activity (DNA hypomethylation) and clinical responses were observed with CC-486, although the cross-over design (with SC Vidaza administered during 
Cycle 1) confounded the interpretation of these responses in Part 1 of the study.
The second part of the AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 study went on to explore both daily and twice
daily extended dosing schedules of 14 and 21 out of 28 days in a non-crossover fashion.  CC-486 administered 300 mg QD for 14 and 21 days of a 28-day cycle produces cumulative exposures 
(area under the concentration curve [AUC] per cycle) that are approximately 40% and 60% of 
the exposure achieved with the labeled dose and schedule of Vidaza, respectively. Daily doses of 
[ADDRESS_78671] proven to be tolerated on both the 14 and 21 out of 28-day schedules with 
myelosuppression, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, a nd fatigue being the most common toxicities 
(Garcia-Manero, 2011 ).
In the AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 study , DNA methylation levels in  blood were measured as a 
pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint, to determine DNA hypomethylating activity of CC-486.  In 
summary, it was confirmed that CC-486 is biologically active, reducing DNA methylation when 
administered at low doses on extended schedules.
1.3.1. CC-486 Experience in Solid Tumors
A Phase 1 study of CC-486 in combination wi th carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel, or as a single 
agent in subjects with relapsed or refractory  solid tumors (AZA-ST-001) was initiated on 
30 Nov 2011.  In Part 1 of this two-part study, CC-486 at escalating doses of 200 or 300 mg was 
administered on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle in three separate arms of the study (Arm A, Arm B, Arm C).
In Arm A of AZA-ST-001, subjects received carboplatin (AUC = 4) on Day 8 of each cycle and 
in Arm B, subjects received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m
2beginning on Day 8. For Arm A, both 200 
mg and 300 mg were well tolerated with carboplatin AUC = 4.  For Arm B, initially, nab-
paclitaxel was administered weekly starting on Cycle [ADDRESS_78672] dose level of CC-486. The protocol was amended to give nab-paclitaxel on Days 8 and 15 of each cycle (ie, 2 out of 3 weeks) and this was well tolerated 
in combination with CC-486 at 200 mg. When the CC-486 dose was escalated to 300 mg, dose-limiting ne utropenia was again encountered, making the 200 mg the MTD of CC-486 in 
combination with nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m
2on a 2- out of 3-week schedule. Arm C of Study

1.4. Rationale
CC-486 as a single agent has shown promising activity in NPC subjects in a Phase 1 clinical trial
with durable responses. CC-486 was tolerated in subjects when used at the dose of 300 mg daily for 14 days out of 21-day cycle with a manageable safety profile.
As an epi[INVESTIGATOR_72598], it is hypot hesized that CC-486 will lead to immune-mediated 
antitumor effects in subjects with NPC. The use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_72599]:
!Frequent wide-spread methylation of cancer-related genes in NPC ( Lo, 2013 ).
!Genetic abnormalities and EBV play major role in pathogenesis of NPC.
!NPC is strongly associated with EBV infection ( Thompson, 2007 ), with DNA 
methylation playing an important role in  the maintenance of specific EBV latency 
programmers and regulating EBV lifecycle and latency in NPC cells ( Paulson, 1999 ; 
Tierney, 2000 ; Salamon, 2001 ; Zhang, 2012a ). &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21aluable uable

4.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 2, single arm, multicenter, inte rnational study to assess the safety and efficacy of
single agent CC-486 (oral azacitidine) in previously treated subjects with locally advanced or 
metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, who have progressed (clinically or radiographically) after 
having received 1 to 2 previous regimens, including a platinum agent. The co-primary endpoints 
are ORR and PFS.
Approximately 51 to 55 efficacy evaluable subjects will be enrolled according to Simon’s 
optimal two-stage design; if the predefined activit y is met (> 4 responses [CR/PR] out of the first 
17 efficacy evaluable sub jects based on independent radiological assessment), then the study will 
continue to enroll an additional 34 efficacy evaluable subjects. If ≤ [ADDRESS_78682] v1.1 initially every 6 weeks (± 5 days)

6.2. Follow-up Period
6.2.1. Efficacy Follow-up
All subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, start of new 
anticancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent from the entire study will be followed for tumor 
response assessments and subsequent anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72602] 6.3.
6.2.2. Survival Follow-up
After the EOT visit, all subjects will be followed every 8 weeks (± 5 days) for survival until
withdrawal of consent, death, or lost-to-follow up, whichever occurs first. Subsequent anticancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72603].  New anticancer therapy includes (but is not 
limited to) any systemic or local medication, surgery , radiation, or any other therapy intended to 
treat the subject’s cancer.
Survival follow-up may be conducted by [CONTACT_72634] (including public records) and/or 
telephone contact [CONTACT_1155], family, or the subject’s treating physician.
6.3. Response Assessments
Response assessments (tumor evaluations) shoul d be performed at screening within 28 days 
before the start of IP, and every 6 weeks (± 5 days) from Cycle [ADDRESS_78699] v1.1 performed ≤ [ADDRESS_78700] v1.1, according to Investigator assessment.  Response 
assessments include computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 
the head and neck with supraclavicular node imaging, the chest and abdomen/pelvis, 
neurological examination with facial nerve evaluation, and bone scans at baseline for all 
subjects. Bone scans will be repeated only if the subject is symptomatic or with known bone metastasis .&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21sion, start osion, start o

[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Assessments
Subjects who are symptomatic for brain metastasis at screening must undergo a brain scan to 
confirm eligibility. All subjects must undergo bone scans at baseline.
6.4. Pharmacokinetics
A subset of enrolled subjects (Asian-Pacific island ethnicity only) at a selected number of experienced sites that have the ability to collect, process, and ship CC-486 PK samples will 
participate in PK sample collection. Six subjects of Asian-Pacific island ethnicity initially being 
administered 200 mg CC-486 on Days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle will be asked to participate in the 
PK sample co llection at these selected sites. An additional 6 subjects of Asian-Pacific ethnicity
will participate in the PK sampling if the dose is escalated to 300 mg in this population.
On each PK day (ie, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 14), subjects will ingest IP in the clinic after performing 
the required overnight fasting, if applicable tak ing antiemetic premedication (eg, odansetron), 
and completing the required pre-dose assessments (where applicable), with each dose being 
given at approximately the same time of day.  The exact
date and time of dosing will be recorded 
in the source documents and appropriate CRF.
Blood samples for oral azacitidine PK a ssessment will be collected prior to each dose 
administration (pre-dose) and over the 8-hour period following each dose administration (0.25, 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_78704]-dose or similar schedule) (see Table 2 ).

Celgene Corporation will supply CC-486 100-, 150-, and/or 200-mg tablets for oral 
administration.  All tablets will be packaged in blister packs. Each tablet is formulated using 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_72605].  A list of 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_72606].
All IP must be stored in an area free of environmental extremes and a secured area to prevent 
unauthorized access, as directed on the package label. A temperature log must be maintained.
8.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
CC-486 will be administered at a dose of 300 mg orally daily (QD) for [ADDRESS_78722] 6 Asian-Pacific Island ethnicity subjects evaluable for safety will 
receive CC-486 at a dose of 200 mg orally daily for 14 of 21 days of Cycle 1; and if well-tolerated, and there are no safety concerns, (see Section 8.2.1 ) subsequent subjects of Asian-
Pacific Island ethnicity will be administered at the [ADDRESS_78723] IP with approximately 240 mL (8 ounces) of room temperature water.  
Investigational product may be taken on an empty stomach or with food (a light breakfast or 
meal of up to approximately 600 calories), except on PK sampling days.
8.2.1. Tolerability Determination in Asian-Pacific Island Ethnicity
The first 6 evaluable for safety subjects of Asian-Pacific island ethnicity receiving 200 mg daily 
will be assessed for tolerability and determination if dose can be increased to 300 mg daily in subsequent subjects.  If ≤ [ADDRESS_78724] of Asian-Pacific Island et hnicity experiences a dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT), the initial 200 mg dose will be increased to the 300 mg dose in subsequent subjects. If ≥2 subjects of Asian-Pacific Island ethnicity experience a DLT, the dose may be 
decreased to 150 mg daily, at the discretion of the sponsor.
A DLT is defined as an IP-related AE(s) occurring in Cycle 1 (including predose assessments on 
Cycle 2 Day 1) that leads to permanent treatment discontinuation or meets one of the following 
criteria:
!Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 10 days or accompanied by [CONTACT_411] (defined as >

10.2. Study Population Definitions
The following study population w ill be used for this study:
!Safety Population – All subjects w ho received at least one dose of IP.
!Efficacy Evaluable Population – All subjects who meet all eligibility criteria, and 
EITHER
1. Received at least two cycles of IP at any dose intensity and discontinued 
treatment for progressive disease, OR
2. Received at least four cycles of IP at any dos e intensity and have baseline and at 
least two post-screening tumor assessments.
Subjects not eligible for the Efficacy Evaluable population will be replaced at the discretion of 
the sponsor.
!Pharmacokinetic Population – All subjects who have evaluable pharmacokinetic data from at least one dose of IP.
Subjects receiving the [ADDRESS_78730] imation is based on having s ufficient sample in the Efficacy Evaluable
population to show that the ORR is higher than 20% or median PFS is > 5 months. Simon’s 
optimal two-stage design will be used ( Simon, 1989). The null hypothesis that the true ORR is at
least 20% or median PFS is at least [ADDRESS_78731] stage, 17 subjects will be accrued. If there are 4 or fewer responders in these 17 subjects, enrollment will be stopped. Otherwise, 34 additional subjects will be accrued for a total of 51subjects. Subjects who progress to the end of Cycle 1 are not evaluable for efficacy and will be 
replaced. This Phase 2 study will be considered positive if more than 14 responders are observed 
in 51 subjects or the hypothesis of median PFS equal to 5 months is rejected. This design yields a 
marginal one-sided type I error rate of 5% and power of 85% when the true ORR is 40%. After 
the second stage (n = 51), the power for showing median PFS is > 5 months is 80% (60%) when 
the true median PFS is about 8(7) months.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,211.1.1

Subjects’ age, height, weight, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics, while gender, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabulations.  Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by [CONTACT_53428].
10.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposition (analysis population allocat ion, entered, discontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both treatment and follow-up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by [CONTACT_27707]. Protocol deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations.
10.6. Efficacy Analysis
Efficacy analyses will be perfor med on the Efficacy Evaluable population.
The hypothesis testing for the ORR will be based on the exact binomial distribution. The point 
estimate and two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of ORR will be provided. In addition, if 
Stage 2 is conducted, the Kaplan-Meier procedure will be used to estimate the median PFS and two-sided 90% CI. The hypothesis testing for the PFS will be based on the exponential 
distribution.
Subjects who die, regardless of the cause of death, will be considered to have had an event.  
Subjects who withdraw consent for the study will be considered censored at the time of 
withdrawal.  Subjects who are still alive at the time of the clinical data cut-off date will be 
censored.  All subjects who were lost to follow-up prior to the clinical data cut-off date will also be considered censored at the time of last contact.
The Kaplan-Meier procedure will be used to estimate proportions of event-free intervals for OS.  
Median OS and two-sided 90% CI will be provided.
10.7. Safety Analysis
The safety population will be included in the safety analyses.
Safety and tolerability will be monitored through continuous reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events, labora tory abnormalities, and incide nce of subjects experiencing dose 
modifications, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of IP. Data from all subjects 
who receive one or more doses of IP w ill be included in the safety analyses. Adverse events, 
physical examinations (including vital sign measurements), clinical laboratory information, and concomitant medications/procedures will be tabulated and summarized.
Adverse events will be analyzed in terms of TEAE defined to be any event that begins or 
worsens in grade after the start of IP through [ADDRESS_78732] dose of IP. Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_926]/grade based on the CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_78733] se verity. All AEs, as well as TEAEs, will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_6657]. Adverse events leading to death or to

special interest of CC- 486 identified in previous trials will be summarized in a similar manner.
10.8. Interim Analysis
Interim analysis will be performed according to Simon’s optimal design based on the population 
evaluable for efficacy as described in Section 10.2.
10.9. Assessment of Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic measures are incorporated into th e study to assess the extent of exposure, and to
explore the relationship between CC-486 and PD effects. Blood samples for PK will be collected from a subset of subjects at selected visits. As appropriate, PK parameters, but not limited to the 
following, will be determined from plasma concentration versus time profile data:
!Area under the plasma concentration time-curve (AUC);
!Peak (maximum) plasma concentration (C
max);
!Terminal half-life (t 1/2);
!Time to maximum plasma concentration (T max);
!Clearance (apparent, CL/F); and,
!Volume of distribution (apparent, V z/F).
Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation [CV%], geometric 
mean, geometric CV%, median, min, and max) will be provided for all data. Results will be presented in tabular and graphic forms as appropriate.
Sample collection kits and detailed instructions for PK sample co llection, processing, storage, 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and handling will be provided to the Investigator sites upon study initiation.
Plasma azacitidine will be measured using validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
methods (LC-MS/MS).

11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an  injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_14540] 11.3), regardless of 
etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be  considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of 
the diagnosis or syndrome.
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section 8.2.4 for the definition of overdose.) Any sequela 
of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be 
identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported 
as an SAE itself.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or surgical findings, phys ical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_72641] i nformed consent 
until [ADDRESS_78735] dose of IP and those SAEs made known to the Investigator at any time 
thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be recorded on the AE page of the CRF and in the subject’s source documents.  All SAEs must 
be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using t he SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form.
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:
11.2.1. Seriousness

CC-486-NPC-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 48 CC-486-NPC-001 Final: 11 July 2014!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as thos e occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
!A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72612] a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.
!Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not asso ciated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27590] a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social reasons, in absence of an AE.
!A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study); must 
be documented in the source document and the CRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing condition unrelated to the studied indication.
!Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form must be completed.
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide i nformation on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.

CC-486-NPC-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 49 CC-486-NPC-001 Final: 11 July 201411.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity / intensity of the event.
The severity / intensity of AEs will be gra ded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor version of the CTCAE, Version 4.0;
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be  evaluated for severity / intensity according to 
the following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]
!Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limita tion in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595]
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP
administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP 
and the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21calal

event.
11.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event.
11.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the 
SAE).
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study;
!requires treatment, modification/ interrup tion of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory abnormality should be r ecorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events .
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while th e subject is on IP, or within [ADDRESS_78737]’s last dose of CC-486, are considered immed iately reportable events.  IP is to be icable able

11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], 
or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This instruction pertains to initial SAE report s as well as any follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to CC-486) that occur during the 
study (from the time the subject signs informed  consent until [ADDRESS_78741] (IP), and any SAE made known to the Investigator at anyt ime thereafter 
that are suspected of being related to IP.  SAEs occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary

with country-specific requirements.
Events of disease progression for the disease unde r study (including deaths due to disease 
progression for indications that are considered to be fatal) will be assessed as expected adverse 
events and will not be reported as exped ited safety reports to regulatory authorities.
Celgene or its authorized re presentative shall notify the Investigator of the following information
!Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, S[LOCATION_003]R);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity; and,
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of

IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigato r will conduct all aspects of this study in 
accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
14.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions. 
The Investigator should maintain a list of Sub-Investigators and other appropriately qualified 
persons to whom he or she has d elegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
document and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) for source data 
verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely  and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.
14.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent
The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any study related procedures.
Documentation that informed consen t occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents 
including the date.  The original informed consent document signed and dated by [CONTACT_72645]’s entry into the 
study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.  
In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the 
informed consent document must be revised.  Study  subjects participating in the study when the 
amended protocol is implemented must be re-conse nted with the revised version of the informed 
consent document.  The revised informed consent document signed and dated by [CONTACT_72646]’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21in

compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy an y medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed informed consent document, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain 
such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.
14.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_27730]/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator n ame, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.
14.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protocol , informed consent docu ment, and any other 
appropriate documents will be submitted to the I RB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the 
documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as 
applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to 
the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements.
IP can only be supplied to an Investigator by [CONTACT_72648] a nd legal requirements for starting the study has been received by 
[CONTACT_72649]. This  documentation must also include a list of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of th e committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially signed by a commi ttee member. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document 
should also be revised.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21ain n

to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary.  Resolutions 
to these issues will be reflected in the database.  An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.
15.3. Record Retention
Essential documents must be retained by [CONTACT_72651] a minimum of [ADDRESS_78751] retain these documents for the time period described above or according to local laws or requirements, whichever is longer.  Essential documents include, but are not limited to, the following:

16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the study are review ed with the Investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Investigator meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protoc ol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_27738].
Accuracy will be checked by [CONTACT_12939] a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs and app licable s upporting records  of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by [CONTACT_1744]/IECs, regulatory au thorities (eg, FDA, EMA, Health Canada) and 
company authorized representatives.  The Investig ator should make every effort to be available 
for the audits and/or inspections.  If the Invest igator is contact[CONTACT_72652], he/she should contact [CONTACT_27740].

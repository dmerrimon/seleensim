Short  Title:   
Randomised efficacy and safety clinical trial of PQ Grass in subjects with seasonal allergic 
rhinitis and/or rhinoconjunctivitis induced by [CONTACT_698652].  
Phase: Phase III  
Sponsor: Allergy Therapeutics ([LOCATION_006]) Ltd, Dominion Way, Worthing, West Sussex, BN14  8SA, 
[LOCATION_008].  
Study centres: The clinical trial will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002] of America (US) and in 
5 countries in Europe at approximately 90 clinical trial sites. 15 study sites in total (7 centres in 
the EU and 8 centres in the US).    
Rationale:  
The PQGrass306 (G306) clinical trial is the pi[INVESTIGATOR_698646]. 
The aim of the G306 pi[INVESTIGATOR_698647] [ADDRESS_948563] of PQ Grass on the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR)/rhinoconjunctivitis 
and the use of relief medications to control these symptoms during the peak grass pollen season 
(GPS).  
Number of subjects planned:  
The trial will apply an adaptive group sequential design with one interim analysis that will be 
performed on the subjects randomised in Year 1  (N=555) . In case the decision is taken to 
progress the study to a second season after the  interim analysis , the sample size will be 
recalculated.  
Study period: Estimated first subject enrolled (Q3/202 3) and last subject last visit (Q3/202 4). 
The end of study (EoS) is defined as the date of the last [ADDRESS_948564] in the study.

Overall Design (Brief Summary):  
This is a multi -centre, randomised, parallel group, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical 
trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of the optimal effective dose of PQ Grass ([ZIP_CODE] SU). 
The trial will have an adaptive group sequential design with one pl anned interim analysis.  
Subjects will be assigned in a ratio of 1:1 (PQ Gras s:Placebo ) with treatment course to be 
completed prior to the onset of the grass pollen season (GPS):  
• PQ Grass:  6 injections of PQ Grass (900, 2700, 6000, 6000 , 6000, 6000  SU 
sequentially) or 
• Placebo:  [ADDRESS_948566] 2  follow -up 
telephone calls. Subjects will be provided with enough relief medication to cover them through 
this period by [CONTACT_3452].  
Period 1  (Screening [ Visit 1 ± Visit 1a ]): This includes the screening visit at which subjects’ 
eligibility for the clinical trial will be assessed.  
Period 2  (Randomisation and treatment [ Visit 2 to Visit 7 ]): At Visit 2, subjects will be 
randomly allocated in a randomisation ratio of 1:1 to the active treatment (PQ Grass) or the 
placebo treatment group and will receive the first injection.  
After Randomization at Visit 2, s ubjects will thereafter return to the study site at subsequent 
visits during the treatment period (Visit 3 to Visit 7) to receive the remaining injections. The 
average duration of the treatment period will be approximately 16  weeks.  
Treatment with either 6 injections of active treatment (900, 2700, 6000, 6000, 6000 and 6000 
SU sequentially) to achieve a cumulative nominal dose of [ADDRESS_948567] their allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis 
symptoms and use of relief medications in an electronic diary (eDiary). The symptom and 
medication scores during the peak GPS and the entire (or truncated) GPS calculated according 
to the Euro pean Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) recommendations for 
the CSMS (primary endpoint) will be compared between the active and placebo treatment 
groups.  The following 4 visits will be performed:  
• Visit 8 (pre -GPS)  
• Visit 9 (≈ onset of GPS)  
• Visit 10 (during GPS)  
• Visit 11 ( ≈ end of GPS)

Period 4  (Telephone safety follow -up): This consists of safety telephone calls at approximately 
[ADDRESS_948568] injection to ascertain occurrence of any AEs.  
Target population: Adult (18 to 65 years inclusive) subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis 
and/or rhinoconjunctivitis due to grass pollen exposure (with or without allergic asthma that is 
well controlled).  
Study treatments, dosage and mode of treatment:  
Active Treatment : 
Each PQ Grass injection will consist of extracts of grass pollen, which are chemically modified 
by [CONTACT_698653] L -tyrosine.  
The injections will be supplied at concentrations of 900, 2700, and 6000 SU per 1.0  milliliter 
(mL) and 50  microgram (µg)/1.[ADDRESS_948569] adjuvant, 2% weight per volume (w/v) L -tyrosine 
and 0.5% (w/v) phenol.  
Reference Therapy : 
Placebo (Buffered saline with L -tyrosine 2% [w/v] and phenol 0.5% [w/v])  
The average duration of treatment will be approximately 11 to 18 weeks.  
Dose/Dose schedule : 
PQ Grass or placebo will be administered during Visits 2 to 7. Visits 2 to 4 will be 
approximately 1 week apart, Visit 5 to 7 will be approximately 4 weeks apart . 
 
Statistical methods  
This is the pi[INVESTIGATOR_698648]. The primary endpoint of the study will be the 
CSMS averaged over the peak GPS.  
The difference in CSMS between PQ Grass and placebo  will be evaluated using a linear mixed 
model . Subjects with missing daily CSMS during the peak GPS will be included in the primary 
analysis by [CONTACT_698654] a by -day level.   
The statistical analysis will be performed using a linear mixed model.  In the context of the 
adaptive design, a 1-sided testing will be used using g roup sequential Pocock boundaries chosen 
such that an overall 1 sided type 1 error rate of 2.5% was preserved.  
For the interim analysis after Year 1, the 1 -sided p -value was therefore to be compared with α 
= 0.[ADDRESS_948570] squares (LS) means. 
Two-sided appropriate confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference between treatment groups 
  
 Protocol : PQGrass30 6 
 
   Page 6 of 9 
 
will be  provided. The difference between treatment groups will also be presented in percent 
relative to the LS mean in the placebo group.   
The secondary endpoints will generally be analyzed using a similar statistical approach as the 
primary endpoint. The statistical hypotheses for the key secondary endpoints will only to be 
tested in a confirmatory sense if the analysis of the primary endpoint is statistically significant. 
Multiplicity in the key secondary endpoints will be  addressed.  
The frequency, relationship and severity of AEs and frequency of premature discontinuations 
from treatment or study due to AEs will be assessed within each treatment group.

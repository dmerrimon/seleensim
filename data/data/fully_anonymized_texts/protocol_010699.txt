1. Abstrac t 
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research hypothesis, 
and the importance of the  research.  
Abuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_288998] a significant national health problem. Pharmacogenetics, or personalized medicine, uses genoty pe 
information to predict phenotypic response (generally medication efficacy or safety). The field of substance abuse is 
critically lagging behind in the application of pharmacogenetics for identifying individuals at increased risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_914009], or using personal genetic information to guide treatment. There is growing 
evidence to suggest a functional polymorphism (A118G) in the OPRM1 gene that codes for the mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] 
(MOR) mediates individual response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_914010]. To date, no controlled human laboratory studies have examined the effect of the A118G SNP or 
OPRM1 gene on individual response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. The next logical step is to evaluate whether di fferences in OPRM1 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) drive individual response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], which will help advance 
the field of substance abuse towards a pharmacogenetics approach to treatment, and establish a precedent for using 
controlled  and well -validated laboratory methodology to investigate the genotype -phenotype interactions of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
We are proposing to conduct a laboratory study to evaluate whether the A118G SNP and additional OPRM1 tagging 
SNPs are associated with a variety of di fferent MOR -mediated functions by [CONTACT_914105] -blind administration of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]. We will also evaluate the contribution of OPRM1 
on other complex phenotypes related to the MOR activity or opi[INVESTIGATOR_914011] (e.g., pain sensitivity, the 
endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -mediated cortisol stress response, and a delay discounting behavioral economic task). This study 
will be a between -group evaluation of genotype and sex, and a within -subject evaluation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533] -response that 
will be conducted over 5 days in a residential clinical research unit. Study completers (n=100) will receive double - 
blind doses of oral hydromorphone or placebo in a randomized, counter -balanced research design. Self -report, 
physiological, an d salivary cortisol measures of drug effects will be collected at several time points following drug 
administration, and delay discounting will be administered at screening and during peak drug effects. We will also 
administer different operant pain tasks that provide quantifiable estimates of pain sensitivity, under conditions of 
placebo or hydromorphone administration. This study will be the most controlled, rigorous, comprehensive 
examination of the A118G SNP and OPRM1 gene with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -mediated effects t o date. We expect that genotype will 
be associated with several opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -mediated effects, and that the results will advance our understanding of the 
contribution of OPRM1 to specific behavioral phenotypes. These data will advance the use of pharmacogenetics  for 
substance abuse and use of laboratory testing for genotype -based hypotheses, and will contribute to the development 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_914012].  
 
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives).  
The primary aim of this study is to examine the associations of specific polymorphisms in the OPRM1 gene with 
mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] (MOR) -mediated effects. We hypothesize the minor A118G SNP allele and OPRM1 tagging 
SNPs will predict more reinforcing properties of hydromorphone, (e.g., higher self -report ratings of high and drug - 
liking) and greater opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced physiological changes (e.g., pupil diameter, blood pressure), decreases in cortisol 
levels as a function of th e degree of pleasant effects of hydromorphone, and steeper discounting curves on a delay - 
discounting task. The secondary aim of this study is to examine the associations of specific polymorphisms in the 
OPRM1 gene with laboratory measures of pain. We hypo thesize the minor A118G SNP allele and OPRM1 tagging  
JHMIRB eFormA 01  
Version 3 Dated: 06/[ADDRESS_1284334] higher pain threshold on two experimentally -induced laboratory measures of pain, lower analge sic 
efficacy in response to experimentally -induced pain, and lower cortisol response to painful stimuli. Finally, as an 
exploratory aim, we will examine the contribution of sex to the primary and secondary  aims.  
 
3. Background (briefly describe pre -clinical a nd clinical data, current experience with procedures, drug or 
device, and any other relevant information to justify the  research)  
 
Abuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_914013] a 57% and 717% increase in treatment admissions between 1992 -2008 for 
heroin and prescriptio n opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], respectively (1). Opi[INVESTIGATOR_683286] a chronic, relapsing disorder that is associated 
with greater health care services, more emergency room visits, prolonged disability, missed work days, and frequent 
overdose, resulting in an annual societal  cost of more than $8 billion (8 fold greater than nonabusers; (2, 3).  
Laboratory evaluations of opi[INVESTIGATOR_914014] -person differences in self -report 
and physiological response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (4 -8), however no persistent demographic, drug use, and/or treatment 
characteristics have been identified that reliably predict susceptiblity to develop opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] (9 -15). The 
phenomenon of varied individual response to drugs is not limited to opi[INVESTIGATOR_914015] (16, 17). Pharmacogenetics, one approach to 
personalized medicine,  addresses this phenomenon by [CONTACT_914106] 
(generally medication efficacy or safety; (18, 19). Regarding opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], there is growing evidence to suggest a 
functional polymorphism in the OPRM1 gene that codes for t he mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] (MOR) may mediate individual 
response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_914016] (20 -25). The 
most commonly researched single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the MOR is a nucleotide excha nge in exon 1 at 
the 118 position of the N -terminal domain (26), which results in an amino acid change from aspargine to asparate at 
position 118 (Asn40Asp or A118G, rs1799971).  
We were the first group to show that the A118G SNP of the OPRM1 gene has funct ional consequences on 
human behavior (27). Human laboratory studies have reported a reliable and robust, endogenously -mediated cortisol 
response to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_287202] (27 -32), a greater adrenocorticotropic hormone stress response (29), and 
decreased pupi[INVESTIGATOR_238344] (33 -35) in response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]. Laboratory studies examining alcohol 
and nicotine have reported functional associations between the A118G SNP of the OPRM1 and behavioral outcomes 
such as increases in striatal dopa mine following nicotine exposure (36), decreased cerebral blood flow following 
nicotine abstinence (37), increased MOR binding potential (38) and MOR availability (39), finding smoking more 
reinforcing (40, 41), and greater sensitivity to alcohol. Most rec ently we have identified that the minor allele predicts 
lower D2/D3 receptor binding potential in the nucleus accumbens (Wand and co -workers, editorial review in 
preparation). Altogether, these data are now being used to predict clinical differences in tre atment response based on 
OPRM1 status, such as efficacy of naltrexone for alcohol treatment (42, 43), nicotine replacement products for 
nicotine (44, 45), and severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms (46). The field of medicine has embraced the 
promise of pharmacogenetics more broadly and has published several studies that use genotype to guide treatment for 
alcohol (47), breast cancer (48), hepatitis C (49), warfarin (see (50), leukemia (51), AIDS (52), P450 enzymes (53), 
psychotropic medications (54), and  pain (55). This approach has great potential because it prevents physicians from 
prescribing medications that have a lower likelihood of working or are unsafe within different genetic subgroups, 
ultimately increasing efficiency, reducing time to positive therapeutic response, and minimizing potential side effects 
of medications. Patients also support the use of genetics to guide prescribing  (56).  
The field of substance abuse is critically lagging behind in the application of pharmacogenetics for 
identifyin g individuals at increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_914017], as well as using personal genetic 
information for tailoring treatment decisions. The majority of studies that have evaluated the contribution of the 
OPRM1 gene to human behavior are e ither Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that provided self -report 
surveys to large patient samples and looked for associations, or retrospective chart reviews that collected genetic 
information from clinical patient populations who received opi[INVESTIGATOR_914018] (21, 57 -66). The primary 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_914019] (e.g., substance abuse) is either poorly defined or unreliably 
measured. The field of genetics has begun moving away from these association models; they do not y ield consistent 
results because the measures used to define the phenotype are very heterogeneous across studies and are ultimately 
poor representations of the target phenotypes. Two independent reviews have recently argued that controlled 
laboratory examin ations of endophenotypes that are evaluated under rigorous experimental conditions better 
approximate the complex phenotype of drug dependence and produce stronger effect sizes than large -scale 
association studies that rely on retrospective self -report (67 , 68).  
To date, no controlled human laboratory studies have examined the effect of the A118G SNP or the larger 
OPRM1 gene on individual response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. The proposed laboratory study is a necessary first step to evaluate  
JHMIRB eFormA 01  
Version 3 Dated: 06/2007  
Page 4 of 26   whether differenc es in OPRM1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) drive individual response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_281539], which will help advance the field of substance abuse towards a pharmacogenetics approach to 
treatment, and establish a precedent for using controlled, relia ble, and well -validated laboratory methodology to 
investigate the genotype -phenotype interactions of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Laboratory studies are ideal for targeting specific 
behavioral phenotypes because they are rigorously controlled, permit within -subject evaluation s of drug effects and 
double -blind dose administration, identify dose -graded effects, target well -established and specific phenotypes of 
drug use behavior that can be directly compared to existing literature to guide interpretation of effects, permit cross - 
laboratory and cross -species comparisons and replication of effects, are robust and reliable predictors of clinical 
outcomes, and produce larger effect sizes than GWAS studies (67, 68). Our group has specific expertise in 
conducting laboratory assessment s of opi[INVESTIGATOR_914020] a model that is considered the standard by [CONTACT_4469], industry, and national organizations (69). Thus, we are proposing to conduct a laboratory 
study to evaluate whether the A118G SNP and additional OPRM1 ta gging SNPs are associated with a variety of 
different MOR -mediated functions by [CONTACT_914107] -blind 
administration of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536], pain sensitivity and response to medications for pain (secondary aim, 
beginning Page 9), the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -mediated cortisol stress response, and a delay discounting behavioral 
economic task that has been reliably associated with the drug abusing phenotype. This study will advance our 
understanding of the contribution of genotype to abuse liability, pain, endogenous stress response, and delay 
discounting. These data can be used to modify analgesic doses and treatments, reduce potential for side effects from 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], predict susceptibility to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] (7 0, 71) and develop innovative intervention 
strategies, and advance the use of controlled laboratory testing to evaluate genotype -based hypotheses. This study 
will also provide a unique opportunity to identify whether these effects are evident among people that demonstrate 
increased abuse potential for opi[INVESTIGATOR_914021].  
There is also substantial individual variation in the subjective response to nociceptive (e.g., painful) stimuli.  
Genetic factors have been shown to contr ibute to that variation (72 -75) and growing evidence indicates the 
functional action of the OPRM1 may influence the associated endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_233376] (mediated by [CONTACT_57134] - 
endorphin) to pain (26, 76). Several studies report that the minor allele of the A1 18G may confer a resistance to 
nociceptive (e.g., painful) stimuli. First, carriers of the minor allele have lower beta -endorphin -mediated serum 
concentrations of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (77), and a robust beta -endorphin mediated increase in 
cortisol release following naloxone administration (27 -32). Second, controlled human experimental studies report 
higher pain thresholds in minor allele carriers (78 -81), and a longitudinal cohort study reported higher positive  affect 
across 30 days of repe ated measurement among A118G minor allele variants with the chronic pain disorder 
fibromyalgia (82), which is consistent with preclinical studies that reported increased pain sensitivity following 
direct administration of beta -endorphin  (83, 84). The mino r allele of the A118G has also been consistently 
associated with increased medication requirements to achieve analgesia. For example, preclinical and human 
laboratory studies report that A118G minor allele carriers experience less relief from opi[INVESTIGATOR_914022] (85 -87), and 
several retrospective chart reviews report greater postoperative medication requirements (35,  88-96). 
Additional, well -controlled studies are needed to understand and advance our knowledge regarding the effect 
of the A118G SNP and additiona l OPRM1 tagging SNP variants on baseline pain tolerance, and pain tolerance 
under conditions of opi[INVESTIGATOR_565019]. Only two studies have examined the contribution of the A118G on 
pain tolerance in controlled laboratory settings (78, 81). The first  study reported positive associations between 
A118G and pain on two of the three pain tolerance tests conducted, but did not evaluate tolerance to pain following 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_914023] (78, 81). The second study reported a positive association with OPRM1 on one test of 
pain following oxycodone administration, but did not evaluate additional pain tolerance tests, which is important 
given the high rate of individual variability among pain testing methods (78, 81). Neither study sampled across the 
OPRM1  gene and or was designed to prospectively evaluate gender, which is critical because of the robust gender - 
specific effect that exists on pain and its potential interaction with the OPRM1 gene (41). The current study will 
extend upon these studies by [CONTACT_914108] A118G SNP and OPRM1 gene using a quantitative sensory 
testing (QST) paradigm, under conditions of double -blind and placebo -controlled hydromorphone administration, 
and will conduct gender specific analyses. Women will only be enrol led during the first two weeks of their cycle 
(confirmed via progesterone analysis) to minimize hormonal effects on pain, which will be the most rigorous 
evaluation of OPRM1 and pain within gender to date. Further, one of our pain tests will activate the d iffuse noxious 
inhibitory control (DNIC) system, which is mediated by [CONTACT_241418][INVESTIGATOR_59791], hypothesized to be a model 
of chronic pain, and believed to contribute to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced hyperalgesia (97). No prior study has used the DNIC 
procedure to ev aluate OPRM1 effects on pain tolerance, which is critical because of the established functional 
relationship between the OPRM1 and the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_233376] (26, 98). The results will advance our 
understanding of the OPRM1 contribution to pain toleran ce and response to medication, help elucidate the

4. Study  Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures 
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine  care).  
 
Study Overview : This study will be a between -group (total completer N=100) evaluation of genotype and sex , and a 
within -subject evaluation of opio id dose -response. The study will be conducted over 5 days (4 nights) at the 
Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU) and a residential clinical research unit (CRU) (Figure 1). Day [ADDRESS_1284336] of blinded study drug administration in the morning, 1 pain testing 
session, and self -report/physiological measures of drug effects for [ADDRESS_1284337] dosing. Participants will receive 
double -blind doses of oral hydromorphone (2mg, 4mg, 8mg) (99 -102) or weight and color -matched p lacebo in a 
randomized, counter -balanced research design.  
 
Screening Visit : Participants will complete a brief phone screen to determine initial eligibility and will be invited to 
complete an in -clinic screen. Participants will sign an informed consent form with a study staff member to begin the 
Screening visit. To reduce expectancy effects, the consent will inform participants th e study drug may consist of one 
or more of numerous different drug classes (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], stimulants, over -the-counter medications), a common 
practice in laboratory based studies of drug effects (103, 104). Following consent, a staff member will administe r a 
battery of measures to establish study eligibility (see Study Measures below). A urine sample will be collected and 
tested for evidence of illicit drugs and to establish medical eligibility. A blood sample of no more than 2 tablespoons 
will also be col lected from eligible participants for medical and genotype analysis. Participants will also be asked to 
provide a second blood sample (2 additional tablespoons) that will be collected at either Screening or Admission and 
stored for future genetic analysis.  This will be voluntary. Participants who meet eligibility criteria (including results 
of laboratory blood tests) will be scheduled for an Admission day.  
 
Study Day 1, Admission Visit: Participants will complete a brief history and physical to determine fi nal study 
eligibility and will be admitted to the CRU for 5 days (Admission day + 4 session days). During the Admission day, 
participants will be familiarized with the pain testing procedures and the measures used during session days 2 -5. 
 
Study Days 2 -5, Session Days: The morning of each session, participants will be provided with a standardized 
breakfast, and cigarette smokers will be permitted 1 cigarette the morning prior to a session (1 additional cigarette 
will be permitted every 2 hours during the se ssion). Sessions may take place either at the CRU or the BPRU, 
however all participants will reside overnight in the CRU. Participants will receive a standardized lunch and dinner. 
Beginning on Day 2, participants will receive a blinded study drug in the m orning, will conduct a pain testing session 
approximately [ADDRESS_1284338] -dosing. Each element is described in more detail be low. Participants will 
also provide a blood sample (no more than 1 tablespoon) that will be analyzed for metabolic status. This sample can 
be collected at any point during Study Days  2-5. 
Pain Testing : Participants will undergo [ADDRESS_1284339] of pressure 
pain threshold, conditioned pain modulation, and temporal summation testing. Participants will be oriented to the 
study measures and pain testing apparatuses during the Admission Day. During the sessions, study drug w ill be 
administered under double -blind conditions in the morning. Salivary cortisol samples will be collected following 
completion of the pain testing session to evaluate the acute stress response to each pain stimulus, as a function of

will be asked to identify whether a placebo or active drug had been administered.  
Pressure Pain Threshold:  The pressure pain threshold is defined  as the kilopascals (kPA) value at which a 
mechanical stimulus is first judged to be painful. An electronic algometer with a 1cm2 hard rubber probe will be 
applied two times to two different muscle groups in randomized order. Pressure will be applied at a constant rate of 
30kPA/s until the participant first reports pain. A 30 second interval will be imposed between each stimulus 
presentation (105). The values in kPA will be averaged across administrations and muscle groups to create an index 
of pressure pai n threshold. Administering the stimulus at multiple anatomic locations increases the reliability of the 
pressure pain threshold. Possible effects of laterality and muscle group will be evaluated to determine if threshold 
outcome measures should be separate d into subgroups.  
Conditioned Pain Modulation : We will also conduct a test of conditioned pain modulation,  
formerly known as diffuse noxious inhibitory controls. Conditioned pain modulation is the process by [CONTACT_914109] a tonic conditioning stimulus inhibits the pain produced by [CONTACT_914110] a distal anatomic 
location. This procedure initiates a robust activation of the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_914025] (106). Our conditioned pain modul ation procedure will measure the change in pressure 
pain threshold at the trapezius muscle induced by [CONTACT_914111]. Two baseline 
pressure pain threshold readings will be assessed via algometry. Participants will then im merse their hand in a 
circulating ice water bath maintained at 10 +/- 1¡ C and will not be told the du ration of time for which their hand will 
be submerged. After 20 seconds, with their hand still submerged, participants will rate their pain on a 0 -100 numeric 
rating scale (NRS; (107), where 0=No Pain and 100=is Worst Pain Imaginable, and after [ADDRESS_1284340] to laterality will be randomized. Conditioned pain 
modulation will be indexed as the percent change in  pressure pain threshold from the baseline administration to the 
conditioned administration, averaged across the 2 trials (105). Conditioned pain modulation can be conducted with a 
variety of heterotopic conditioning stimuli, including thermal, ischemic, a nd electrical stimuli. Cold -water immersion 
(also known as the cold pressor test) is an attractive choice for the conditioning stimulus because noxious cold 
stimuli activate cutaneous A∂ and C fibers, resulting in rapid nociceptive neurotransmission (108).  This conditioned 
pain modulation method has been selected for this study because it has been independently validated as a sensitive 
and reliable measure of descending pain inhibition (109), and it activates the endogenous system that is hypothesized 
to be  altered by [CONTACT_821346]1  gene.  
Mechanical Temporal Summation . Temporal summation of pain will be assessed using repetitive mechanical 
stimuli. The assessment of temporal summation involves rapi[INVESTIGATOR_297957] a series of identical noxious stimuli and 
determining  the increase in pain across trials; animal studies have suggested that temporal summation occurs 
centrally in second -order neurons in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_914026] a consequence of sustained C -fiber afferent input (149 -151). 
For temporal summation of mechanical pain , pain ratings in response to a single punctate noxious stimulus will be 
compared to pain ratings in response to a sequence of identical punctate noxious stimuli (152). A weighted pi[INVESTIGATOR_914027] a flat contact [CONTACT_914112] a single pi[INVESTIGATOR_297960] a train of [ADDRESS_1284341] been used in diabetic neuropathy (153), healthy subjects (154), and to 
assess temporal summation (155 -156).  
 
Acute Effects of Hydromorphone : Participants will ingest medication under staff supervision and complete 
a battery of self -report, physiological, and cortisol measures will be collected prior to dosing and up to [ADDRESS_1284342]-dose (up to 6 hours). During the final assessment each day, participants will complete a Drug vs. Money 
Questionnaire modeled from the Multiple Choice Procedure to indicate the dollar value they would place upon the 
drug received and this measure will be repeated immediately prior to the next day’s drug admini stration. These 
experimental procedures are consistent with those used in a previous study by [CONTACT_27156] (110). Participants will be 
discharged from the study on the final day after completing the final study assessment and a field sobriety test that 
indica tes no persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_9781]. We will conduct a follow -up phone call with participants the day following 
discharge to document any adverse events and to administer the final Drug vs. Money Questionnaire.  
 
General Study Assessments : We have included sev eral measures during the Screening visit to enable us to 
characterize the population and collect preliminary information that might differentiate between genetic groups or be 
used to support future research applications, including a questionnaire to evalua te domains the NIDA Genetic  
JHMIRB eFormA 01  
Version 3 Dated: 06/2007  
Page 7 of 26   Council recommends be documented in genetic studies. The measures comprise both pharmacologically and 
qualitatively nonspecific measures (e.g., any drug effect) and qualitatively specific measures (e.g., liking, go od 
effects, bad effects, nausea), which have been recently recommended by a consensus panel and the FDA. OPRM1 
has recently been associated with negative side effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_914028] f ollowing drug administration.

speed/pattern recognition (e.g. digit symbol substitution) and short -term/working memory and focused  attention 
(e.g. N -back  task).  
 Hypothetical Purchase Task: This questionnaire is used to measure the abuse liability of drugs by [CONTACT_914116] a given drug under cost constraints. Participants indicate how  many

 We will administer monetary and commodity -based DD tasks via computer to participants during the Screening 
visit, and each session day during peak drug effects (30 minutes). DD for $100 will be assessed using a computer 
program developed by [CONTACT_15957] -investigator Johnson that has been utilized in numerous studies (121 -126) and will be 
quantified using the area -under -the-curve (AUC) method (127). The hypothesized results are that the minor 
allele of the A118G and other minor alleles of OPRM1 tagging SNPs will be associated with steeper discounting 
curves (less  AUC).  
 
Genetic Analysis: Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_914031] -Investigator Wand. All blood genetic samples will be 
collected and transported to the main Hopkins hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52123] a weekly basis for analysis. A chain of custody will be 
kept to ensure proper delivery and receipt of all samples. No participants name [INVESTIGATOR_1317] w ritten on any genetic sample 
and participants will not be informed of the results of the genetic testing.  
For all SNPs across the OPRM1 gene including the A118G and ancestral markers (see Statistical Analysis), 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_914032]. The DNA sample used in this assay is activated 
for binding to paramagnetic particles. This activation step is a highly robust process that requires a minimum input of 
DNA (250ng at 50ng/µl). Depending upon the multiplex level, this equate s to only 160pg of DNA per SNP genotype 
call. Assay oligonucleotides, hybridization buffer, and paramagnetic particles are then combined with the activated 
DNA in the hybridization. Three oligonucleotides are designed for each SNP locus. Two oligos are spe cific to each 
allele of the SNP site, called the Allele -Specific Oligos (ASOs). A third oligo that hybridizes several bases 
downstream from the SNP site is the Locus -Specific Oligo (LSO). All three oligonucleotide sequences contain 
regions of genomic compl ementarity and universal PCR primer sites; the LSO also contains a unique address 
sequence that targets a particular bead type. Up to 1,[ADDRESS_1284345] to the LSO joins information about the genotype present at the SNP site to 
the address s equence on the LSO.  These joined, full -length products provide a template for PCR using universal 
PCR primers. Universal PCR primers P1 and P2 are Cy3 - and Cy5 -labeled. After downstream -processing 5 the 
single -stranded, dye -labeled DNAs are hybridized to their complement bead type through their unique address 
sequences. Hybridization of the GoldenGate Assay products onto the Array Matrix or BeadChip allows for the 
separation of the assay products in solution, onto a solid surface for individual SNP genotyp e readout. After 
hybridization, the BeadArray Reader is used to analyze fluorescence signal on the Sentrix Array Matrix or  BeadChip, 
which is in turn analyzed using software for automated genotype clustering and  calling.  
 
b. Study duration and number of study  visits required of research  participants.  
 
Participants will complete a Screening visit and will be enrolled in this study for a total of 5 days (Admission Day + 
4 session days; Figure 1).  
 
c. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if  applicable.  
 
Participants will be informed in the consent will that the study drug may consist of one or more of numerous different 
drug classes (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], stimulants, over -the-counter medications). This is a common practice in laborator y-based 
studies of drug effects, a practice that we have followed for several years, and one that is recommended in peer - 
reviewed guidelines for abuse liability testing (103, 104). We will inform participants of the risks associated with 
hydromorphone (wi thout revealing the drug type) in the consent form so they will be able to make an informed 
decision about study participation. Participants will receive double -blind oral doses of hydromorphone or placebo 
during the study to prevent expectancy effects and  enable a rigorous evaluation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_914033] a variety 
of clinically -relevant outcome measures. Staff members will also be blinded to what study drug is being provided.

f. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal  criteria.  
 
Participants will be removed from study participation if they ask to be removed, if they exhibit an allergic reaction to 
the study drug, if they fail to comply with the requirements of the study, or if new information becomes available that 
suggests that continued study participation may put them at increased risk of adverse events.  
 
g. Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if a participant’s 
participation in the study ends  prematurely.  
 
Participants ar e healthy controls. They are not treatment -seeking and do not have any underlying medical condition 
that would warrant continued treatment upon completing the study. Participants will be informed they can agree to 
begin the study now and withdraw later wit hout any penalty. Participants who request to discharge from the study 
prior to completing the study will be assisted with contact[CONTACT_914117].  
 
5. Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria  
 
We will recruit healthy volunteers  who may have consumed prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_914034], but are not currently dependent (Table 1). Restricting our sample to completely opi[INVESTIGATOR_391662]ïve 
individuals would not be feasible, because verifying a histo ry of no opi[INVESTIGATOR_914035], and because we 
did not want to exclude participants who received clinically -indicated prescriptions. Non -dependent drug using 
participants have been strategically chosen to minimize potential confounds with current opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] (e.g., 
tolerance, presence of pain) and human subject concerns regarding need for treatment. Use of non -dependent 
participants is a common practice in laboratory studies of drug effects and there is no evidence to suggest this 
exposure pu ts individuals at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_687334] (see Human Subjects section). Finally, females 
will be enrolled in the study during the 1st two weeks of their menstrual cycle (confirmed via diary and 
progesterone) to control for hormonal influence on  opi[INVESTIGATOR_914036]. We will not exclude females taking 
birth control but may include birth control as a covariate in the statistical analyses.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
 
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be  used.  
JHMIRB eFormA 01  
Version 3 Dated: 06/[ADDRESS_1284347] severa l years experience administering it under double -blind, laboratory 
conditions (4, 7, 8, 128-135). The doses of hydromorphone chosen for this study are supported by a study conducted 
by [CONTACT_527086]., (2008), in which oral hydromorphone was administered to n on-dependent individuals in doses up to 
25mg (136). The authors of that study had no instances of respi[INVESTIGATOR_914040]02 at any of the 
doses administered. That study compared the reinforcing effects of oral hydromorphone with the two prominently 
abused opi[INVESTIGATOR_914041] a history of recreational 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_914042]. Prior to beginning the study, the researchers conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_914043] 5 doses of oral  hydromorphone [2.5 mg – 35mg] were administered to enable identification of several safe, 
tolerable and detectable doses for study administration. The researchers reported the [ADDRESS_1284348] doses [2 and 5mg] were 
inactive within a population of recreational bu t non -dependent individuals, and ultimately selected three mid -range 
doses [10mg, 17.5mg, 25mg] based upon evidence of safety and  tolerability.  
 
We have chosen to deliver doses lower than those administered by [CONTACT_914118] e 
individual differences in the ability to detect the low dose of hydromorphone. Participants in our study will receive 
three active hydromorphone doses. The first dose participants will receive is the mid -level dose, which will be 
administered on study Da y 2. Any participant who has a negative reaction to this dose will be discharged from the 
study. The participants will receive placebo, low, and high doses on Days 3 -5 of the study; the order of doses will be 
randomized and counter -balanced. These doses we re deemed safe in the same participant population in the Walsh 
study, they produced a documented detectable range of subjective effects, and they represent supratherapeutic doses 
consistent with those abused recreationally. Ultimately, we feel confident th ese dose values do not impose any 
unique risk above and beyond that presented by [CONTACT_914119].  
 
Generic powdered hydromorphone will be encapsulated using size 0, opaque, hard gelatin capsules; placebo will be 
size and weight matched and will contain microcrystalline cellulose filler. A pharmacy member with no participant 
interaction will conduct the dose randomization. All medication administration will be supervised and a medical staff 
member will be available to address any adverse events or to break the medication blind.  
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -FDA approved 
indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant populations are changed.  
 
Hydromorphone hydroc hloride is a pure mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_233401], rectal, intramuscular 
(IM), or intravenous (IV) formulations for the indication of acute and/or chronic pain. We have chosen to administer 
hydromorphone orally in this study to reduce th e potential for side effects and adverse events associated with the 
more direct parenteral administration, and to increase the clinical relevance of the study by [CONTACT_914120] -abused formulation of hydromorphone. This will also extend the  time course of hydromorphone effects, 
which will help us to achieve our study aims. When administered orally, hydromorphone is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_914044] -pass metabolism. Exposure to hydromorphone is 
proportional to the dose range, with in vivo bioavailability of an 8mg tablet being approximately 24%. Following 
oral administration, peak plasma level of hydromorphone is generally attained in 30 – 60 minutes, and approximately 
95% of hydromorphone is metabolized to hydromorphone -3-glucuronide via glucuronidation in the liver. There is no 
apparent effect of sex on the pharmacokinetics of  hydromorphone.

7. Study  Statistics  
 
a. Primary outcome variables.  The primary outcome variables are self -reported ratings of drug high and liking, 
changes in pupil diameter and blood pressure, pain threshold on [ADDRESS_1284349] that individuals with the minor allele of the A118G SNP and other  
JHMIRB eFormA 01  
Version 3 Dated: 06/2007  
Page 11 of 26   tagging SNPS across the OPMR1 gene will find hydromorphone more reinforcing (e.g., higher self -report ratings of 
high and drug -liking ) and exhibit greater opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced physiological changes (e.g., pupil diameter, blood pressure). 
Research also suggests the OPRM1 gene may also confer greater sensitivity to the negative effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which 
may be observed as measuring greater rati ngs of nausea. We also hypothesize the minor allele and other tagging 
SNPs across the OPRM1 gene will produce higher pain threshold on [ADDRESS_1284350]  magnitude.  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis:  The aims of the proposed study will 
explore the impact of genetic variation across the OPRM1 gene on hydromorphone response. There are specific steps 
we describe below to assure that we interrogate all known functional variation across the OPRM1 gene, adequately 
cover all other variatio n using appropriately selected tagging SNPs, prevent spurious associations due to population 
stratification by [CONTACT_914121], and properly control the Type I error  rate. 
Association Model:  Our primary goal is to demonstrate the impact of SNP variation across OPRM1 on 
variability in response to hydromorphone across time and dose. Association analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_914122] a general linear model . In its simples t form this test, commonly termed the measured 
genotype analysis (137), models the influence of genotypic variation at a given locus on variation in the quantitative 
trait, essentially a one -way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). This approach provides a distin ct advantage in that it 
can easily be extended to a two -way ANOVA to model genotype effects across [ADDRESS_1284351] of OPRM1 at each time -point in separate analyses and account for the multiple testing 
using LD -adjusted Bonferroni correction (see below).  
Power and Correction for Multiple Testing:  Power (1 -Type II error) and correction for multipl e testing 
(control of Type I error) are important considerations in any genetic association study. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_914045] I error rate of a given set of hypothesis tests by [CONTACT_914123]. This is not problematic when a handful of tests are performed at 
an alpha level (false positive level) of 5%, where the usual approach is the Bonferroni correction. We anticipate 
performing tests across multiple time -points and must adjust our target alpha level. Importantly, our 71 selected 
SNPs across the OPRM1 gene (see below) do not represent 71 independent tests due to correlation between SNPs. 
We will use an approach, termed SNPSpD (138) which uses spectral decomp osition to estimate the number of 
independent tests across the region. Using available HapMap data, we estimate [ADDRESS_1284352] size difference between genotype groups (at each dose other than placebo), at an alpha level 
conservatively adjusted for 50 tests to .001, using the entire completer sample (N= 100) or the sex subsamples 
(N=50), we have >80% power for modest e ffect sizes of ~.[ADDRESS_1284353] size 
(Cohen’s d) is the mean difference between genotype groups in standard deviation units. Importantly, this effect size 
is well within the range seen by [CONTACT_914124] r esponse difference in OPRM1 (e.g., Ray et al., 2004: 
effect size = 1.2).  
SNP selection (for association testing and control of Local Ancestry): SNPs will be genotyped across the 
OPRM1 region to allow us to test associations across the gene and account for genetic ancestry (ethnicity). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_914046] (LD). A more cost -effective strategy is to select a su bset of 
representative SNPs (tagSNPs) that are in strong LD (measured through pairwise r2) with other SNPs that are 
therefore not required for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_914047]. We followed this 
approach across OPRM1 w ith the Tagger algorithm at an r2 value of 0.8 and a minor allele threshold of 0.05 (139).  
We force included all predicted functional variation with allele frequency > .[ADDRESS_1284354] Data release 21 (CEU Sample) of HapMap 
(http://www.hapmap.org ) in conjunction with the NCBI build 35/hg17 of gene and EST data at UCSC Genome 
Browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi -bin/hgG ateway ;). Using this approach, we selected 71 SNPs across the OPRM1 
region for association testing and control of local ancestry. In our approach, we will re -estimate local ancestry for  
JHMIRB eFormA 01  
Version 3 Dated: 06/2007  
Page 12 of 26   each SNP association, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_914048]. Our approach to accounting for population 
stratification is detailed below.  
SNP Quality Control: Maximizing genotype accuracy is a key step in maximizing our ability to detect true 
genotype -phenotype relationships. We will perform the usual  checks to ensure data precision. We will first test 
Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and eliminate markers that exhibit large deviations from expected genotype 
distribution. The rationale for this step is to eliminate markers that may exhibit systematic g enotype error (e.g., 
excess failure of a particular allele due to allele loss). We do realize that minor deviations from HWE will be 
observed by [CONTACT_914125] a large number of markers. Thus, we will use a stringent criterion for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_914049] s exhibiting Hardy -Weinberg disequilibrium (p < 0.001). Additionally we will eliminate markers that exhibit a 
high level (>5%) of missing data. A high level of missing data is generally interpreted as an indicator of a poor 
quality marker. We will eliminat e individuals with a high level (>5%) of missing genotypes as this is likely due to 
poor DNA  quality.  
Population Stratification: In the context of genetic association testing, population stratification refers to 
genetic differences between subpopulations. This is especially problematic in instances where the investigators are 
blind to the presence of stratification and/or the population substrata also differ phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. In these cases, 
association analyses will be prone to generate spurious genotype -phenotype relationships. Previously, several 
methods, including genomic control (140) and STRUCTURE (141) were proposed to deal with this issue by [CONTACT_914126] a priori groupi[INVESTIGATOR_914050]. At the 
onset of the GWAS era, the wealth of genome -wide data gave rise to additional approaches which rely on the 
correlation structure of genetic information to identify cryptic population structure. EIGENSTRAT (142) is an 
example of an approach that uses genomewide data to infer principal components of population membership.  
Recently, several investigators (143, 144) have noted that differences in global (genomewide) versus local (at a gene 
or LD block) ancestry exist, especially in admixed popul ations (e.g., African -American). This is particularly germane 
to our setting given: 1) the genetic ancestry of the ECA sample is a mix of European -Americans and African - 
Americans, 2) the focus on a relatively small number of genes, and 3) the lack of geno me-wide SNP data. We will 
use an approach (WinPOP/LAMP; (144, 145) to estimate proportions of local ancestry at each tested gene and 
account for stratification based on those mixing proportions in subsequent GLM tests. In order to accomplish this we 
will d ensely tag OPRM1.  
Analysis of pain testing sessions:  We hypothesize that OPRM1 SNP variants will exhibit greater pressure 
pain thresholds, greater CPM efficiency, lower hydromorphone -related analgesia, and lower cortisol stress response 
than participants w ith the major allele, and that results will be positively correlated with response to self -report and 
physiologically -mediated hydromorphone drug effects collected during days 3 -5. Pressure pain threshold will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_914127] 2  administrations to radiobrachialis and quadriceps muscle groups. We will 
generate a CPM index for each participant [(mean pressure pain threshold during cold pressor)/(mean pressure pain 
threshold prior to cold pressor)] x 100 (90). These values will prov ide a quantitative measure of percent change in 
the test stimulus (i.e., pressure point threshold). Mixed effects regression models with a random intercept will be 
used to compare dependent variables (pressure pain threshold, DNIC threshold, DNIC index) as  a function of within - 
subject drug effects (placebo vs. hydromorphone), and between -subject effects of OPRM1 SNP analysis will be 
conducted as specified in Aim 1. Gender, age, and race have been associated with response to pain and the CPM test 
(146-148).  Gender will be evaluated using independent subgroup analyses and age and race will be included as 
covariates. Finally, subscale scores of self -report measures of pain and copi[INVESTIGATOR_914051] t -tests, and drug identification data will be compared using  a 
chi-square for each drug condition. We expect that both experimental manipulations will induce pain in the minor 
and major allele groups, and that participants with the minor allele wi ll demonstrate lower sensitivity to pain (e.g., 
greater pressure pain magnitudes), lower NRS ratings of pain, lower cortisol response to painful stimuli, and lower 
analgesic relief from hydromorphone compared to the major allele participants.  
 
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  The safety of participants is a priority of BPRU. If a participant experiences a serious side 
effect that seems to be related to the study drug, s/he will be discontinued from the study. If clinically indicated the 
participant will be refer red to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC) Emergency Department for 
further treatment. BPRU and the CRU have policies in place to ensure safety of all participants and staff, and some 
policies may lead to administrative discharge of a particip ant, and therefore, discontinuation from the  study.  
Participants who do not abide by [CONTACT_233475], or who demonstrate behaviors abusive of staff 
or other participants may be discontinued from the study. Intercurrent illness or condition  changing a participant risk 
may result in medical discharge from the study.

Version 3 Dated: 06/2007  
Page 13 of 26   Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_140482]:  In addition, an independent panel of consultants will be contracted for review 
of the risks -benefits ratio of the study. At mid -point during enrollment this panel will be provided with a report of 
adverse events and participant outcome data (subjective response to hydromorphone) by [CONTACT_914128] (A vs. 
B). This information will be used to assess whether the risks reported are co nsidered to be of unusual magnitude or 
frequency across any specific group, and to determine whether the study should be ended prematurely due to 
participant safety concerns or because a result has been unequivocally demonstrated. It is unlikely that such a small 
study would be interrupted because of a large rate of adverse events, particularly given the noninvasive 
administration method of the medication (i.e., oral) and our experience at administering this drug, however we will 
ensure that a qualified pan el of reviewers makes this decision.  
 
8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected  frequency.  
 
Hydromorphone: Our research team has extensive experience administering hydromorphone under controlled 
laboratory condit ions. Administration of any drug involves some risk because it is not always possible to predict 
individual response to drugs. The most likely risk in this study is that subjects will experience side -effects of the 
drugs that may be unpleasant. Common side  effects of hydromorphone are light -headedness, dizziness, sedation, 
nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. Less frequently observed side 
effects are weakness, headache, agitation, tremor, uncoordinated muscle m ovements, alterations of mood 
(nervousness, apprehension, depression, floating feelings, dreams), muscle rigidity, paresthesia, muscle tremor, 
blurred vision, nystagmus, diplopia and miosis, transient hallucinations and disorientation, visual disturbances,  
insomnia, increased intracranial pressure, flushing of the face, chills, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], faintness, 
syncope, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm and laryngospasm, constipation, biliary tract spasm, ileus, 
anorexia, diarrhea, cra mps, taste alteration, urinary retention or hesitancy, antidiuretic effects, urticaria, other skin 
rashes and diaphoresis. Side effects of hydromorphone are generally temporary, dissipate within several hours, and 
are dose -dependent. Thus, participants may  only experience side -effects occasionally during the research study.  
Serious potential adverse effects of hydromorphone administration that are possible but extremely unlikely to be 
encountered in this study are respi[INVESTIGATOR_914052]. The most serious potential adverse 
event following hydromorphone administration is opi[INVESTIGATOR_914053], which is characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_41826], somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin,  constricted 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In serious overdosage, particularly following intravenous 
injection, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. We believe the risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_914054] o verdose in this study to be low for the following reasons: we have extensive experience in the 
administration of hydromorphone, we have chosen doses that have been demonstrated directly by [CONTACT_914129] (99 -102) to be safe and t olerable in an identical participant population, we will exclude 
any individual who has a medical condition that may increase the risk for respi[INVESTIGATOR_233415]/or other adverse 
events, all medication doses will be administered by a trained research n urse, and participants will be monitored [ADDRESS_1284355] effects.  
 
Chance That Participants May Begin Abusing Opi[INVESTIGATOR_914055]:  There is a 
small but potential risk that exposing non -drug abusing individuals to doses of hydromorphone designed to elicit 
reinforcing effects may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_233423] -use behavior. Enrolling non -drug users into controlled laboratory 
studies is a conventional strategy that has been used extensively to evaluate the abuse liability potential of numerous 
drugs of abuse both within our laboratory and by [CONTACT_164892]. We feel confident this strategy imposes minimal 
risk on the participants, and ha ve provided justification for this assertion in the Protection Against Risks section.  
 
Risks Associated with Genetic Analysis:  We have established several precautions to prevent breach of confidentiality 
regarding genotype status that are discussed in the Protection Against Risks section. There is a low risk for breach of 
confidentiality regarding genotype status and that a participant’s genetic information can be linked to his or her 
questionnaire assessments.  
 
Discomfort from Pain Testing: Participants wi ll likely find the pain testing procedures uncomfortable for a brief 
period of time. This effect is expected to be transient and to produce only mild levels of discomfort.  
 
Breach of Confidentiality:  Although staff members are highly trained to maintain pa rticipant confidentiality, there is 
always a risk that some of the confidential information collected could be revealed to people who are not involved in  
JHMIRB eFormA 01  
Version 3 Dated: 06/[ADDRESS_1284356] instituted several practices to prevent a 
breach from confidentiality from occurring (see below); thus, we believe this risk to be minimal.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the  risks.  
 
Prior to study enrollment, a medical staff member carefully screens participants to exclude those with an increased 
risk of adverse events. Trained nursing staff member conducts all medication administrations, and a code to break the 
drug blinds is always available if needed. Specific protection against risks are outlined below.  
 
Protection Against Hydromorphone Risks : We also have extensive experience in the administration of 
hydromorphone and other opi[INVESTIGATOR_233424]. 
Any individual who may be prone to the risks associated with hydromorphone will be excl uded from participating. 
The FDA has identified the following conditions as increasing the risk for respi[INVESTIGATOR_914056]: patients with status asthmaticus; chronic obstructive pulmonary  
disease; reduced respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]; high blood pressure; impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal functions; 
myxedema or hyperthyroidism; adrenocortical insufficiency; gall bladder disease; acute alcoholism; history of 
convulsive disorders; history of  head injury; currently taking sedatives, hypnotics or phenothiazines; and sulfite 
allergy. Mean exposure to hydromorphone is also increased [ADDRESS_1284357] concomitant medications (e.g., 
anti-nausea medications) will also be available as needed to treat any unpleasant side effects that may occur as a 
result of hydromorpho ne administration and participants will also be able to discontinue study participation at any 
time. Finally, the most serious risk associated with hydromorphone administration is respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. We 
believe this risk is minimal in this study for se veral reasons. First, we have selected a range of equipotent doses that 
we have previously demonstrated to be safe and well -tolerated in the same participant population (non opi[INVESTIGATOR_914057]) (99 -102) and based upon a previous study that pi[INVESTIGATOR_63772] d and ultimately administered identical 
doses to an identical research sample  (136). Second, we have developed several standard criteria that are followed 
by [CONTACT_233476] a study medication. All 
nursing and research staff are informed of these standards, and a list of these standards is posted in each testing room. 
The standards are as follows: If respi[INVESTIGATOR_233425] 8 breaths/minute and is accompanied by [CONTACT_164893], 
partici pants are prompted verbally to breath. In our experience, verbal and physical stimulation is often sufficient to 
prompt breathing and restore a normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. If respi[INVESTIGATOR_914058]/or if oxygen saturation 
rates fall below 90% satu ration, successive dosing is terminated. Patients are monitored carefully with a “watch and 
wait” approach; during this period they are accompanied continuously by a medical and/or nursing staff member, 
evaluated by a staff physician, and are given supplemental oxygen at 2L/min via a nasal cannula (available on site in 
the exam testing room). If clinical evaluation determines that a participant’s sedation level is increasing, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_914059]. There have been very few incidents throughout our >[ADDRESS_1284358] necessitated actual interve ntion (oxygen and/or 
naloxone), however our equipment and medical/nursing staff is always prepared for this possibility. We feel these 
procedures will sufficiently protect participants from possible adverse and serious adverse events. Finally, we will 
subm it an annual review of study -related adverse and serious adverse events to the Johns Hopkins IRB and an 
independent group of consultants who will serve as our data safety monitoring board for  evaluation.  
 
Protection Against Chance That Participants May Beg in Abusing Opi[INVESTIGATOR_914060]:  Another concern is the possibility that exposure of participants with no histories of drug abuse to 
drugs in our research setting might in some way increase the likelihood of these individuals t o begin abusing illicit 
drugs when they return to the community. The Johns Hopkins IRB closely monitors this issue, and has repeatedly 
concluded that administering drugs that have reinforcing effects to individuals who do not abuse drugs is not 
associated with an increased propensity to begin abusing drugs. Administering drugs that may have reinforcing

Version 3 Dated: 06/[ADDRESS_1284359] ion Severity Index, at a 6 -month 
follow -up assessment (166). Second, a systematic follow -up study reported that alcohol -dependent volunteers 
randomly assigned to laboratory studies either involving or not involving experimental alcohol consumption have not  
differed in their follow -up outcomes (167). Third, a recent study concluded that investigational administration of 
intravenous cocaine to intravenous inexperienced cocaine users did not increase the risk of recreational intravenous 
use (168). Fourth, a st udy conducted by [CONTACT_233478]/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_914061], dollar amounts 
reported spent for various drug classes, or any i ncreases in Addiction Severity Index domain scores at a one month 
follow -up (169). Finally, the College on the Problems of Drug Dependence, a prestigious international association of 
drug dependence researchers, supports the practice of enrolling non treat ment -seeking individuals into drug abuse 
liability evaluation studies. Specifically, the College on Problems of Drug Dependence reported that exposure of drug 
abusers to abused drugs in a controlled research setting does not enhance the desire of an indivi dual to use drugs, 
worsen addiction, or make addiction more difficult to treat (170). Overall, given the substantial data available in the 
literature and our own laboratory experience, we feel confident that administration of small quantities of opi[INVESTIGATOR_914062]. Ultimately, 
we feel the benefits of using this well -validated and heavily researched design to evaluate the association between 
OPRM1 status and ab use liability of hydromorphone outweighs the minimal potential risk that exposure to 
hydromorphone in a controlled research setting could precipi[INVESTIGATOR_914063]. Second, the risk that 
drug administration may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_914064] a quicker 
onset of effects, as is the case with intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal administration. We have therefore chosen 
to administer hydromorphone in an oral formulation, which has the slowest onset of effects, in part to help mitigate 
this risk. Finally, both participants and research staff will be informed the study drug may consist of one or more 
numerous different drug classes (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], stimulants, over -the-counter med ications); this is a 
widely used practice that helps reduce drug expectancy effects (97 -98). This practice will also help protect against 
subsequent abuse because participants will not know exactly what compound produced the reinforcing effects they 
may ha ve experienced.  
 
Protection Against Risks Associated with Genetic Analysis: We believe the risks associated with breach of 
confidentiality regarding genetic status to be minimal because the proposed study does not fall into any of the 
categories identified  by [CONTACT_914130]: (1) pedigree studies that aim to discover the pattern of inheritance of a disease and to catalog the range of 
symptoms involve; (2) positional cloning studie s that aim to localize and identify specific genes; (3) DNA diagnostic 
studies that aim to develop techniques for determining the presence of specific DNA mutations; and (4) gene therapy 
research that aims to develop treatments for genetic disease at the D NA level. In addition, we can identify no a priori 
defined ethical imperative that would necessitate disclosure of the genetic testing results. For instance, given the 
relatively specific eligibility criteria, it is unlikely we will be enrolling members of  families. Second, there is not an 
established association between OPRM1 status and the development of any disease - including substance abuse. If 
new information becomes available that unequivocally indicates a direct link between a genetic polymorphism in  the 
OPRM1 and the development of disease, we will consult with the Johns Hopkins IRB regarding any ethical 
imperative that participants be informed of their OPRM1 status.  
 
Discomfort from Pain Testing:  It is likely that participants will experience some a cute and transient discomfort from 
the pain testing session, however we will work to mitigate that risk as much as possible. First, participants will be 
informed of the pain testing procedure during the informed consent and will be able to make an informed  decision 
regarding their study participation. Second, we chose pain tests (pressure pain and conditioned pain modulation) that 
will produce short -lived effects, and are unlikely to produce any residual pain. Third, we will stop pain 
administration as soon  as participants report the first incidence of “pain” (operationalized as 50% on a scale of 0% 
(no pain) to 100% (extreme pain)). Time to first pain will serve as our dependent variable in the analyses. Fourth, we 
will enforce an upper limit on both pain m easures to prevent any tissue damage from occurring (e.g., hand cannot be 
in cold pressor task for >150 seconds). Fifth, participants will be informed that they can revoke their consent to 
participate in the pain testing at any time without penalty. Finall y, the participants will be monitored 24 hours by  
[CONTACT_390186] 01  
Version 3 Dated: 06/[ADDRESS_1284360] Risks Associated with Confidentiality: To protect confidentiality, all research participants will be 
assigned unique par ticipant identification codes that will be used on all study –related forms and online websites.  
Documents that include the participants’ full names (e.g., signed informed consent forms) will be stored in an 
independent binder, consistent with FDA Good Clin ical Practice Guidelines, and will be kept in a locked room. 
Confidential information will never be shared with anyone outside of the research program without the explicit 
written permission of the research participant. Only selected designated staff membe rs will be approved to share 
confidential information after explicit written permission is obtained from the participant and the participant will be 
able to revoke written permission at any time. In accordance with IRB requirements, all research staff will  be 
formally trained in these procedures. No identifying participant information will be used in written reports, 
manuscripts and/or conference presentations.  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study  deviations.:  
All adverse events will be repor ted to the IRB and other relevant agencies (e.g., FDA, NIDA) as required and as 
described in the DSMP. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -investigators are responsible for reporting such events.  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of  confidentiality.:  
Although there is always a small risk that confidentiality will be breached, we believe this risk to be very minimal 
with the current study.  
e. Financial risks to the participants.  None.  
 
9. Benefits  
Description of the probable benefi ts for the participant and for society: The long -term goal of this research is 
to investigate individual differences in response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and identify genetic differences that contribute to 
variations in the susceptibility of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]. The obje ctive of this application is to determine whether the 
OPRM1 gene predict one of several opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -mediated effects using a rigorous, controlled laboratory study among 
healthy individuals with no history of drug dependence and whether this effect differs as a function of gender. This 
study will constitute the most controlled, rigorous, comprehensive examination of the OPRM1 gene association with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -mediated effects to date. We expect that genotype will be associated with several opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -mediated effects.  
These results are expected to have a positive impact by [CONTACT_914131]1 gene and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -mediated effects, including susceptibility for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]. These data will provide 
positive contributions to the fi eld of pharmacogenomic medication prescribing, the development of opi[INVESTIGATOR_914065], and will have 
implications for other MOR -mediated effects, including alcohol dependenc e.

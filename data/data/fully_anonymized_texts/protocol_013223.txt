Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1009918] sex with men (MSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the US and infections are 
increasing most among young MSM (18-24 years), however, few HIV prevention programs have been 
developed and proven effective with this vulnerable population. To address these HIV prevention concerns, we 
collaborated with community-based organizations (CBOs) in the context of an NIH R34 grant to develop and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087], Keep It Up! (KIU!), an online HIV prevention program tailored to ethnically diverse YMSM. Our small-
scale pi[INVESTIGATOR_83021] (RCT) demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the KIU! intervention: 
we enrolled an ethnically diverse sample of YMSM; achieved excellent retention through 3-month follow-up 
(89%); maintained robust intervention engagement; and produced a significant 44% decrease in unprotected 
anal sex relative to an active control. 
SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE
The
 overarching goal of the current proposal is to advance scientific knowledge of technology-based, 
behavioral HIV prevention, as well as improve public health by [CONTACT_738933]. 
SPECIFIC AIMS
We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. First, we will integrate the KIU! intervention into a 
widely-used health  technology platform to increase its scalability, adaptability, and potential for broad 
implementation. Second, we will test the efficacy of the KIU! eHealth intervention in a multisite RCT by: a) 
enrolling ethnically  diverse YMSM (N = 900; > 65% racial/ethnic minorities) who tested HIV negative in the 
clinics of our community partners in Chicago, [LOCATION_001], and Atlanta. We anticipate that approximately [ADDRESS_1009919] to be screened to enroll this number of YMSM; b) randomizing participants to either the KIU! 
intervention or an HIV knowledge control condition; and c) measuring intervention outcomes at baseline and 
follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1009920], we will explore 
if the  KIU! intervention has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of YMSM based on race/ethnicity, 
relationship status (serious versus casual relationships), and gay/bisexual identity. 
STUDY POPULATION
Ethnically
 diverse YMSM (N = 4532; 18-29 years; > 65% racial/ethnic minorities) who tested HIV negative in 
the clinics of our community partners in Chicago, [LOCATION_001] and Atlanta. (This total sample includes [ADDRESS_1009921]-release testing.)  About 20% of these young men (n = 900) are anticipated to enroll into 
and complete the study. 
STUDY DESIGN
This is  a two-group, active-control, RCT of the KIU! an online intervention.  Participants will be randomized to 
two groups in equal proportions (KIU! condition n=450; control arm n=450).  The KIU! intervention involves [ADDRESS_1009922] 24 hours apart (i.e., at least 3 days), and totaling ~2 
hours to content. Across these modules, the KIU! intervention uses diverse delivery methods (e.g., videos, 
animation, games) to address HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-
efficacy for preventive behaviors.  The control condition contains the same number of modules as the KIU! 
condition, with  the same requirement to participate across three sessions.  It reflects HIV information that is 
currently available on many websites so as to understand how the KIU! intervention improves upon what is 
currently available online. Booster sessions will be delivered at 3 and 6 months for each arm.
PROCEDURES
Participants will  be recruited (1) from the HIV testing clinics and mobile testing units of our partner CBOs in 
Chicago, [LOCATION_001], and Atlanta, (2) from HIV testing at Hunter College and Emory University, (3) from at-
home HIV testing, (4) from street outreach efforts of university staff and interns, (5) using print, online, and

opportunity to visit Emory University, Hunter College, or Northwestern University to complete the baseline 
assessment and complete their first set of self-administered STI test kits. Regardless of recruitment source, 
prior to beginning the intervention, participants will still have the contact [CONTACT_738936]. They will be randomly assigned into one of two 
study groups, either the KIU! intervention or an HIV knowledge control condition.  They will be asked to 
complete online questionnaires (five questionnaires total, approximately 20 - 40 minutes each), complete an 
online intervention within [ADDRESS_1009923] throughout the course of the study (a 
total of 12 months after enrolling).  This research includes at-home urine tests and at-home self-administered 
rectal swabs for STIs. Both STI tests will be collected at pre- and post-intervention (12 month follow-up).  
Participants who test positive at baseline will be tested at 3 month and 6 month follow-up in addition to at the 
12 month follow-up.
  
A. SIGNIFICANCE
A.1. The  burdens of HIV/AIDS and STIs fall disproportionately on YMSM. Among all U.S. youth, YMSM 
accounted for 68% of HIV/AIDS diagnoses in 2008—approximately 3.5 times as many infections as among 
young women in all risk categories14. The CDC’s 2008 NHBS survey of MSM in 21 U.S. cities found the HIV 
prevalence to be 7% in 18 to 19 year-olds and 12% in 20 to 24 year-olds, and much higher among black 
YMSM (9% and 20%, respectively)15. HIV infections among YMSM are almost entirely transmitted via 
unprotected sex16. While less is known about the epi[INVESTIGATOR_738891] (STIs) 
among YMSM, evidence suggests the existence of health disparities17. For example, 20% of YMSM in the 
CDC’s Young Men’s Survey reported a prior STI diagnosis, which is higher than other groups of youth17.
As alarming  as these epi[INVESTIGATOR_738892], there has not been a commensurate prevention 
response. The vast majority of HIV prevention programs in the published literature are focused on 
heterosexual adults and youth18,[ADDRESS_1009924] of efficacy times reach (% of population receiving)24,25. While ideally an 
intervention will be both potent and widely implemented, the current arsenal of HIV prevention in the US 
includes a variety of individual and small group interventions that have proven efficacy for reducing HIV risk 
behaviors in adult MSM26-28 and heterosexual youth28-31 (but not YMSM), but whose reach has been limited by 
[CONTACT_738937]32-37.  Meta-analyses have reported significant effects of 
computer-based programs on HIV risk and protective behaviors that compared favorably to interventions 
delivered by [CONTACT_738938]38-40.  And while computer- and Internet-based interventions have significant 
potential for overcoming barriers to cost-effective implementation37,41,42, the reality is that this potential has not 
yet  been realized by [CONTACT_738939]23.  A critically important barrier to dissemination is that 
fact that most prior eHealth HIV interventions have been built into an IT system that is idiosyncratic to the 
researcher’s environment, thereby [CONTACT_738940], scalability, tailorability, and the ability to 
update and refresh as new technology emerges8.  To meet the bar of potential intervention impact, it is critical 
that eHealth interventions are designed with consideration of reach and future dissemination.  
Of particular  concern is the ability of to reach the highest need groups, such as racial/ethnic minorities with 
online HIV prevention interventions43.  KIU! was designed for delivery upon receipt of a negative HIV test 
result; this innovative approach of linking an eHealth intervention to a clinical encounter was designed to 
increase reach to diverse and high risk YMSM because:

Study Title:  Efficacy of Internet-based HIV Prevention (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_738889]);
Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 4 of 50(a) Most urban  high risk YMSM have recently received HIV testing (77% in prior 12 months; 58% in 
prior 6 months16) and this does not differ by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity44.  HIV testing comprises a large proportion of the 
CDC’s prevention budget45; therefore, linking to this common biomedical service increases the potential for 
sustained intervention  reach and integration into standard care, compared to programs that require their own 
recruitment infrastructure . 
(b) Linking  to face-to-face HIV testing can maximize engagement of racial/ethnic minority YMSM who 
are at  increased risk46. While frequent Internet use is the norm among young adults of all racial/ethnic 
groups47, there is evidence  that Black YMSM are less likely to seek out HIV information online48 and with only a 
few exceptions49,50, prior Internet-based HIV behavioral studies of MSM have substantially under-enrolled 
racial/ethnic minorities43,51-55.  At the time we were developi[INVESTIGATOR_100025] R34 intervention development grant for KIU!, 
our prior experience in conducting research with minority YMSM suggested to us that face-to-face recruitment 
by [CONTACT_738941], even when the intervention was delivered online. Our 
preliminary data from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_738893]-methods research on this topic suggests that indeed this face-
to-face recruitment approach was successful in facilitating racial/ethnic minority YMSM participation46. In the 
course of the proposed study, we will establish the efficacy of this approach for implementing eHealth 
interventions that reach racial/ethnic minorities at the highest risk for infection.
(c) In  addition to increasing intervention impact, linking to HIV testing fulfills an unmet need for greater 
prevention in  the context of testing. Research on the effectiveness of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) in 
reducing risk behaviors  in those who test negative has been mixed56,57. Repeat negative test results are 
correlated with increased HIV risk behaviors in MSM58, perhaps because of perceived invulnerability to HIV 
enhanced by [CONTACT_738942] “dodging the bullet” after multiple negative results. This pattern of increased risk taking 
parallels the concept of “risk compensation” that has been a concern with biomedical prevention approaches59-
62. There is also evidence that prevention counseling is not routinely provided across settings63 and is highly 
variable in quality56. This is a missed opportunity for prevention with high risk YMSM and our goal is to 
transform this into an opportunity for health promotion by “capturing” YMSM in a “teachable moment” via 
technology that is accessible, engaging, and behavior changing. This study will also demonstrate a novel 
approach for linking an eHealth behavioral prevention intervention to a clinical encounter, and this knowledge 
can then  be generalized to future integration of eHealth and biomedical prevention with other emerging 
technologies (e.g.  PrEP).   
A.3. YMSM  have unique HIV prevention needs. HIV prevention programs for YMSM should not be simple 
modifications of those developed for heterosexual emerging adults, as YMSM are impacted by [CONTACT_738943], 
contextual, and developmental factors18,64-67. YMSM share some common risk/protective factors with other 
young people, but also have unique experiences (e.g. family support is protective against HIV risk 68-70, but 
“coming out,” is unique to sexual minority youth).  The role of sociosexual contexts are also dramatically 
different for YMSM than their heterosexual peers (e.g. online/smartphone hook up sites)19,71.  Similarly, 
programs designed for older adult MSM may not generalize to the developmental context of emerging 
adulthood, the unique period during which individuals are “too old” to be adolescents (>18), but not “old enough” 
to be adults (~24)72-74. Psychosocial capacities that are dependent on brain development and which moderate 
risk taking—such as impulse control and resistance to peer influence—continue to mature through emerging 
adulthood75. These developmental factors are nested within sociocultural factors and relational factors, like 
having older partners76-78. Not surprisingly, risk factors such as alcohol consumption have been found to have 
differential effects across developmental stages in MSM79.  
A.4. The  need for an effective intervention across subgroups of YMSM. YMSM are not a homogenous 
group and there is significant need for HIV prevention programming that works across subgroups. At the same 
time, it is important to consider that subgroups may not all respond the same to an intervention. We consider 
three such important dimensions: (a) Compared to their White peers in the U.S. in 2009, more than twice as 
many Black YMSM were diagnosed with HIV80 and Black and Hispanic MSM were more likely to become 
infected at younger ages4. While Black YMSM are most affected by [CONTACT_10840], there is significant need for 
prevention programming with White and Latino YMSM as these group of young men receive more HIV positive 
diagnoses than young women across all racial groups81.  While the causes of these racial disparities are poorly 
understood82-86, cultural factors may lead racial/ethnic groups to be differentially responsive to the content and

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 5 of 50style of  particular intervention71,87-89. (b) MSM is a behavioral groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007], not an identity90,91. Some HIV risk 
processes have been found to differ between gay and bisexual MSM92-94 and these differing identities may be 
linked to the acceptability and effectiveness of an HIV prevention program’s style and content. (c) About 30% 
of sexually active YMSM report being in a “serious” relationship.  Intriguing new findings from Mustanski and 
Sullivan show that among YMSM the majority of HIV transmissions and unprotected sex occur in “serious 
relationships”95,96.  Romantic relationships have only been addressed in minimal ways in most MSM-focused 
HIV prevention programs; therefore, the extent to which interventions work equally well across YMSM in the 
context of serious or casual partnerships is largely unknown. The KIU! intervention was designed to be 
responsive across  these three dimensions of heterogeneity among YMSM, and in addition, an important aim of 
this grant is  to explore moderating effects of these differences on intervention efficacy. If significant differences 
are found, this  information can then be used to target the intervention to subgroups where it is most effective 
and indicate the need for future tailoring to meet the needs of other subgroups.  
B. APPROACH
B.1. Investigative  Team. The interdisciplinary investigative team has complementary experience with eHealth 
research, developi[INVESTIGATOR_738894], distance testing for HIV and STIs, and research with 
YMSM. The team of investigators also has a track record of collaborating on prior studies and initiatives108-117, 
which will enable their distance collaborations (see also C.7). To prepare this application they held two in-
person meetings and multiple conference calls.  They have assembled a cadre of CBOs that perform high 
volume HIV testing with diverse YMSM that have agreed to serve as recruitment.
The NIH  Social and Behavioral HIV Prevention Think Tank committee on technologies stressed the 
importance of behavioral scientists collaborating with computer scientists to maximize innovation and effective 
use of technology8.  This proposal benefits greatly from the collaboration of an internal Health Information 
Technology (HIT) group within the PI’s home department.  The HIT group is a team of computer scientists with 
expertise in software architecture, software development, systems management, and user support.  The HIT 
team created the Assessment Center (AC) platform in the context of an NIH roadmap initiative, and it has been 
used by [CONTACT_46431] 3,000 primarily NIH-funded researchers (see  C.8.). By [CONTACT_738944]-edge HIT expertise throughout the life cycle of the project, including development, 
implementation, and ongoing upgrades and system refinements.  
B.2. Formative  Research. 
(a) Project  Q2 (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_738889]) is the longest-running longitudinal study of LGBT youth. At baseline, 
participants were ages 16-20 and the sample is extremely diverse (86% racial minorities). Using retention 
procedures similar to those in the proposed grant, we achieved 91% retention at the one year follow-up 
assessment82,95,118,[ADDRESS_1009925] 88% retention in the 3.[ADDRESS_1009926] reported on mental 
health119,120, alarmingly high frequency of condom errors (96% of condom users made at least one error in the 
past 6 months)121, family factors122, substance use118,123, racial disparities in HIV risk82, and romantic relationship 
factors95,124. Drs. Mustanski and Greene were recently awarded an NIMH grant (R21MH095413) to study the 
role of romantic relationships in HIV risk across development in this sample. 
(b) Through a  William T. Grant Scholars Award to [CONTACT_739046], we have been conducting mixed 
methods research on the role of the Internet in the development of sexual health among LGBT adolescents. 
Qualitative results125,[ADDRESS_1009927] incorporated into the proposed study125,127. 
(c) Crew 450 (PIs:  Mustanski & Garofalo; R01DA025548) is following an RDS-recruited128 cohort of 450 
ethnically-diverse YMSM (ages 16-20) over 2 years to characterize trajectories of syndemic development. 
Retention in the study has been excellent (85% at 1 year).  Data are available on urine sample tests for N. 
Gonorrhea (NG) and Chlamydia T. (CT) at enrollment and 1-year follow up, yielding estimates of STI 
prevalence = 10.2% and annual incidence = 8.9%.  HIV prevalence at enrollment was 7.8% (58% of these were 
newly diagnosed in the context of the study) and annual incidence is estimated at 2.2%. 
 (e)  The InvolveMENt study (PI: [CONTACT_165166]; R01MH85600) is designed to identify reasons for Black/White 
disparities in HIV incidence and prevalence.  The study is enrolling MSM aged 18-39 from community venues in

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 6 of 50Atlanta and  is following them over 2 years with repeated STI and HIV testing.  High rates of annual incidence 
infections with chlamydia (11.9%) and gonorrhea (3.8%) have been documented among Black participants 
aged < 25 years.  Incidence estimates from this study and Crew 450 are used for power calculations in the 
current proposal. 
(d) Sullivan’s  Checking In  study (RC1MD004370) aimed to overcome barriers to online HIV prevention 
research with MSM, and utilized at-home HIV testing to accrue biological endpoints relevant to HIV prevention 
studies.  Formative research indicated a high level (83%) of hypothetical willingness among MSM to participate 
in at-home HIV testing129; however, some potential barriers were identified and these were mitigated in the 
design. This protocol resulted in 84% of men (N = 896) who agreed to receive an at-home test kit returning the 
dried blood spot specimen130. For men who tested HIV positive, results were available to men through the 
Home Access medical information center, which included a live telephone counselor and referrals to care (86% 
visited a provider within 3 months). For STI testing in the current proposal, the process of mailing a kit and 
having participants return a specimen by [CONTACT_738945]-home HIV testing, but 
with a less invasive specimen collection process, so we anticipate comparably high rates of specimen return.
(e) The  MSM Health and Behavior Survey (PI: [CONTACT_165166]; Emory CFAR, P30 AI050409) is a periodic 
survey of internet-using MSM designed to measure internationally comparable indicators of recent sexual risk 
and use of prevention services among MSM in [ADDRESS_1009928] for an STI at 
home for the purpose of this proposal, a new survey was created to target US men on Facebook (aged 18-24 
years) who indicated they were interested in men. A total of 565 YMSM (97% identified as gay) consented and 
enrolled in the online survey.  The majority of the sample was White (72%) and 15% were Black or Latino. 31% 
of the sample had never tested for STIs.  Participants were asked about willingness to take a confidential, 
urine-based, at-home STI  test as part of a university study at varying levels of hypothetical incentive;  75% of 
participants who were offered no incentive reported being somewhat likely or very likely to participate.  With 
incentives increasing from $10 to $40, willingness also increased from 81% to 86% (differences not 
significant).  This high level of acceptability parallels results for the at home HIV testing in the Checking In 
Study and support the feasibility of our proposed approach to distance testing for STIs.    
 (g)  Parsons’ Young Men’s Health Project  (R01DA20366), is an RCT testing a 4-session motivational 
interviewing risk  reduction intervention for non-treatment seeking HIV- YMSM in NYC with excellent retention 
(85% at 12-month follow-up). Baseline analyses have indicated that several domains addressed via KIU! 
modules are critical factors in predicting risky sex among YMSM. A desire for increased intimacy was shown to 
play a pi[INVESTIGATOR_738895]131. Identification with 
the gay community protects against HIV risk, in that YMSM who feel more connected report increased condom 
use132. Finally, analyses show that substance use and favorable attitudes towards unprotected sex predict 
sexual risk, and mental health moderated the relationship between partner type and condom use. 
(c) [CONTACT_739047] is  PI [INVESTIGATOR_738896]  (R34MH08633), which is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a culturally appropriate 
Internet-based intervention for bisexually active Black men. Through this project, Parsons and his team have 
developed strong collaborative relationships with the four community-based sites which have agreed to 
participate in the proposed study.
 (e)  Drs. Sullivan and Mustanski are respectively leading the Atlanta and Chicago sites for a CDC-funded 
multisite study to develop and test an eHealth solution to recruit and educate MSM to self-administer rapid 
HIV tests. The solution includes components for recruitment, assessment, multimedia education about how to 
self-administer a rapid HIV test, randomization, and referral to care for those who test positive. 
B.3. The  KIU! intervention was developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_738897] R34.   The first year 
was dedicated to conducting mixed-methods research with ethnically-diverse YMSM to inform the intervention 
design and content48 and receive feedback from the target population. An initial screening of 951 diverse 
young men (52% racial/ethnic minority) in HIV testing clinics showed that among the [ADDRESS_1009929] 6 months, 81% identified as gay, 17% bisexual, and less than 1% as heterosexual48, thereby 
[CONTACT_738946]. Most YMSM had used the 
Internet to find HIV/AIDS information (88%). Subsequent qualitative interviews informed the development of 
content (e.g. identification of myths about HIV transmission) and refinement of messaging that was appealing 
across racial/ethnic groups107. Content was developed in collaboration with YMSM-serving CBOs.

training, varied presentation formats, intervention delivery across more than one session, avoidance of formats 
that allow participants to meet offline, and use of a count outcome (e.g. number of unprotected sex acts). 
Finally, the literature supports the importance of using theory of health behavior change as the foundation for 
intervention20,134. KIU! was developed based on IMB model of HIV risk behavior change6,7, which has been 
used among YMSM105, and relapse prevention135, which focuses on identifying triggers for risk and the use of 
cognitive-behavioral strategies to break the link from triggers to risk20,136.   
The KIU!  intervention involved [ADDRESS_1009931] 24 hours apart (i.e. 
at least 3 days), and totaling ~[ADDRESS_1009932] of KIU! was that each module was 
based on a particular setting  or situation relevant to the lives of YMSM, with developmentally appropriate 
health behavior change content embedded within each of these settings (see Appendix 1). Module content is 
designed to be sensitive and responsive to user bandwidth.  Across these modules, the KIU! intervention uses 
diverse delivery methods (e.g. videos, animation, games) to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer 
behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors.

The control  condition contains the same number of modules as the KIU! condition, with the same 
requirement to participate across three sessions.  It reflects HIV information that is currently available on many 
websites so as to understand how the KIU! intervention improves upon what is currently available online. It is 
didactic, not tailored to YMSM, non-interactive, and focused on HIV/STI knowledge.  Using this approach as a 
control condition will ensure that both groups have equivalent access to the Internet for HIV-related content.  
In the third  year, we conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], single-site, RCT  to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and 
intervention effect size. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_738901]. A comparison to clinic records indicates nearly 100% compliance by 
[CONTACT_738947].103 (85% of those invited) YMSM enrolled and were 
randomized (74% minorities). Our block randomization procedure was successfully automated by [CONTACT_738948], with no significant differences in baseline demographic and behavioral variables 
across conditions.
Analytics related to engagement  found high fidelity to intervention and control conditions (completion of all 
modules, mean time in intervention modules matched expected duration). Retention was excellent through 
the 3-month follow-up (87%).   Participant acceptability and interest in the intervention was very high. 
Ratings on the Intervention Acceptability Scale140 were very high. One participant said in an open-ended 
response, “this is the future of gay sex-ed.”  Participants connected to the characters in the intervention 
modules, with one saying, “I wasn't completely aware of my behavior until I judged a character's behavior and 
then compared the same behavior to my own.” At each login, participants were asked about the setting they 
were in; on average they rated the setting as very private and minimally distracting.  The majority of 
participants completed some or all of the intervention from home (98%). At each assessment, participants were 
asked to report any adverse experiences resulting from participation and none were reported. 
In addition  to the primary goal of providing evidence of acceptability and feasibility, analyses of the RCT pi[INVESTIGATOR_738902]. As shown in Table 1, controlling for baseline levels, KIU! showed a 
significant 44%  reduction in the rate of unprotected anal sex, compared to the control arm, among sexually 
active YMSM.  This effect size is larger than the mean 
effect reported  in a recent meta-analysis of offline HIV 
prevention programs delivered to adult MSM26. Promising 
intervention effects were also found for the behavioral 
outcomes of condom errors and failures, which previously 
have been reported to be very high among YMSM121 and associated with STI infection141.  HIV knowledge, 
health protective communication skills, and intentions to use condoms increased in both the KIU! and control 
conditions, reflecting the fact that the control condition was an active HIV knowledge arm. This pattern 
suggests that  both arms had positive effects on attitudinal and knowledge outcomes, but KIU! was significantly 
better in terms of behavioral outcomes.

Study Title:  Efficacy of Internet-based HIV Prevention (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_738889]);
Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 9 of 50Our data on recruitment of  a diverse sample of YMSM, successful retention, high engagement and 
acceptability, and positive intervention effects highlight the promise of KIU! and the value in evaluating it in a 
larger scale efficacy trial. We have also been successful in disseminating findings  of the R34 grant, which 
already include two published papers46,48, one paper under review142, and [ADDRESS_1009936] a multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) of KIU!  To 
achieve aim 1,  months 1-6 will be spent programming new booster sessions (for [ADDRESS_1009937]-
intervention) and conducting technological upgrades in order to bring it to scale in the Assessment Center 
platform.  To achieve aim 2, in months 7-54 we will recruit ethnically diverse young MSM (N=4500; >65% 
racial/ethnic minorities) that test HIV negative from the clinics of our community partners in Chicago, [LOCATION_001], 
and Atlanta. About 20% of these young men (n = 900) are anticipated to enroll into and complete the study. 
We will randomize participants to either KIU! or the existing HIV knowledge control  condition similar to existing 
web-based HIV educational materials. We will measure self-report intervention outcomes at baseline and 
follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1009938] for dose effects and decay in 
intervention effects across the 12 months of follow-up data. To achieve aim 3, we will explore moderators of 
intervention effects, including race/ethnicity, relationship status, and sexual identity.  Our proposed project 
seeks to  advance public health by [CONTACT_738949] a high risk 
and underserved population  (YMSM) and advance scientific understanding of how to utilize eHealth solutions 
to reduce  HIV/STI risk behaviors and link eHealth intervention to clinical encounters. 
B.5. Justification for  a multisite RCT.  The completed single-site, pi[INVESTIGATOR_738903]! intervention provides 
preliminary evidence of the potential of the program. Conducting a multi-city trial of KIU! is a logical next step 
because: (a) recruitment across three cities allows for sufficiently rapid enrollment of diverse YMSM during the 
project timeframe; (b) greater generalizability of findings to YMSM in distinct geographic areas (Midwest, 
Southeast, and East Coast); (c) collaborations with diverse CBOs allows for greater variability in context, which 
can lead to identification of possible obstacles to implementation across settings that can be mitigated prior to 
future dissemination; (d) the size and epi[INVESTIGATOR_738904]/AIDS epi[INVESTIGATOR_738905] a RCT among YMSM.  Both are sites for the National HIV 
Behavioral Surveillance System, which targets metropolitan areas hit hardest by [CONTACT_90050].  In both cities, 
male-to-male sexual contact [CONTACT_738950]153,[ADDRESS_1009939] geographical regions with notable differences in 
population size and culture, but both are highly ethnically diverse (City of Chicago: 2.7M, 35% Black, 28% 
Latino; [LOCATION_001] City: 8.3M, 25% Black, 28% Latino)155. 
B.6. Justification for  STI incidence as a biological endpoint. STIs are important risk factors in the 
transmission and acquisition of HIV infection due to increased biological susceptibility156,157. Randomized trials 
suggest that STI control may have beneficial effects on HIV incidence in populations with high STI rates and 
growing HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509]156,158 such as with YMSM19 (with limited effects in generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509]158,159).  As 
such, there has been a call to incorporate STI testing and treatment into HIV prevention programs at the 
individual and community levels160-162.  At the same time, STI infections can serve as sensitive biomarkers in 
efficacy trials of sexual risk reduction interventions, particularly when HIV infection rates are too low to allow 
sufficient power with attainable sample sizes163-167. In the current study, HIV incidence is not viable as a 
biomedical endpoint because participants are recruited upon receiving an HIV negative test result and, given 
the annual incidence of infections among tested MSM168,169, a sample of >4,[ADDRESS_1009940] for urethral and rectal Gonorrhea (NG) and Chlamydia (CT) and refer for treatment in both 
arms of the trial. Joint NG/CT incidence will serve as a biomedical endpoint for establishing intervention 
efficacy and as a means for determining the feasibility of incorporating an innovative approach to STI testing 
into an online HIV prevention solution. In addition to urethral NG/CT, we will test for rectal NG/CT because 
recent research has shown rectal infection to be just as common, if not more, than urethral infections. Study

Study Title:  Efficacy of Internet-based HIV Prevention (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_738889]);
Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 10 of 50Co-I, Patrick  Sullivan, Ph.D., is part of an Atlanta team that recently analyzed STI incidence of local MSM. 
Black YMSM had a urethral chlamydia incidence rate of 10.5 per 100 PYs but a rate of 22.9 per 100 PYs for 
rectal chlamydia; their incidence rate of urethral gonorrhea was 4.4 per 100 PYs but 20.2 per 100 PYs for 
rectal gonorrhea. White YMSM had a urethral chlamydia incidence rate of 4.5 per 100 PYs but a rate of 6.7 per 
100 PYs for rectal chlamydia; their incidence rate of urethral gonorrhea was 1.5 per 100 PYs but 4.4 per 100 
PYs for rectal gonorrhea215. We focus on NG/CT because: (1) they are the most common STIs among young 
adults in the US81; (2) they are the principal STIs that amplify HIV infection among MSM in the US170; and (3) 
there are established solutions for distance screening that are reliable and acceptable to users171.
B.7. Subjects:  We will recruit an ethnically diverse sample of YMSM between the ages of 18 and 29 (N= 
4532). ). (This total sample includes [ADDRESS_1009941]-release testing.) About 20% of these young men (n = 900) are 
anticipated to enroll into and complete the study.  
Participants will  represent an equal proportion of Black, Latino, and White YMSM, consistent with both high-
risk YMSM populations in each city as well as the demographics of the population seeking services at each 
recruitment site. Given city-specific testing patterns, we will readily achieve representation across groups, and 
we will stratify enrollment to equal 1/3 for each group. 
Study inclusion  criteria include: (1) MSM, defined as a birth male who identifies as male and who self-
reports having sexual contact [CONTACT_738951]; (2) 18-29 years old; (3) report unprotected 
anal sex with another male in the last [ADDRESS_1009942] intervention effects; and (4) are able to read English at a 
minimum 8th grade level, because the measures and intervention are delivered in English.  YMSM will be 
excluded from participation if they : (1) do not have an e-mail address that can be used to contact [CONTACT_738952]; (2)  are currently in a behaviorally monogamous relationship lasting longer than 6 months 
(regardless of partner’s perceived HIV status). We use this criterion because we believe safer sex interventions 
for MSM in long-term monogamous relationships will require substantial tailoring from those who have casual 
sex or in the early phases of a romantic relationship.  Our prior research with YMSM indicates high rates of 
unprotected sex in the early months of a romantic relationship and we will explore relationship status (casual 
versus early stage serious relationship) as an effect modifier95; or (3) Are HIV+. We have elected to exclude 
HIV+ individuals because we believe that secondary prevention messages need to be different than primary 
prevention messages173.  If a participant seroconverts during the follow-up waves, he will be allowed to 
continue participating and be referred to care (see Human Subjects).
B.8. Plan  for long distance collaboration and project management.   Our experience conducting several 
multisite research projects has taught us the importance of regular live- and tele-communication, a clear 
division of roles, and well-developed protocols. As described in detail in the budget justification, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
Project Director will travel to each performance city once per year and there will be annual investigator 
meetings (in rotating cities). We will make extensive use of technology (i.e., e-mail, shared server storage, 
videoconferencing, performance dashboards) to allow for project management and collaboration across sites.  
All tracking and retention activities will be centrally managed in Chicago where the tracking technology is 
based. The research study staff will provide local referrals to treatment and the Atlanta and [LOCATION_001] based 
project coordinators will assist with retention of difficult-to-track participants. Drs. Mustanski, Parsons, and 
Sullivan have been working collaboratively for [ADDRESS_1009943] a long history of effective distance 
communication.
B.9. Phase  1: Technological upgrades to the KIU! intervention and tracking interface in Months 1-6. 
The OAR  Social and Behavioral HIV Prevention Research Think Tank highlighted the ongoing issue in eHealth 
HIV prevention research that the majority of interventions are built into a static IT system that is idiosyncratic to 
the researcher, thereby [CONTACT_738940], scalability, tailorability, and the ability to update and 
refresh as new technology emerges8. Our proposal is highly responsive to this concern as we propose to 
integrate the KIU! intervention into the widely used and supported Assessment Center (AC) platform designed 
IRB #: STU00073433 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/22/2017 through 8/21/2018.
Study Title:  Efficacy of Internet-based HIV Prevention (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_738889]);
Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1009944] a high potential for being adopted by [CONTACT_738953]. NIH has invested heavily in 
projects that use the AC platform (PROMIS - $80 million; NIH Toolbox $25 million; NeuroQOL $7 million, plus 
dozens of smaller projects) and it is being utilized by [CONTACT_738954], eight foreign 
countries have user groups, and it is being adopted in a growing number of academic medical centers (e.g. 
Cleveland Clinic, Northwestern Medicine), and community clinics. The AC platform offers a number of features 
that make it desirable for eHealth interventions, including a participant enrollment/tracking system, a feature 
rich participant data collection engine, and interface that makes it easy to update module content.  We already 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_738906]! modules into the AC platform to assure functionality.  Ongoing 
development (e.g. linkage to electronic health records; text messaging), extensive support, and ongoing 
investment from NIH ensure that it will be the platform to use not just today, but also well into the future. 
After already  reviewing each KIU! session with Atlanta’s and [LOCATION_001]’s diverse investigative teams (which 
includes YMSM staff) and community site collaborators, the consensus was to adapt the first module to include 
local videos to strengthen relevance across settings (Midwest, Southeast, East Coast) and we will implement 
this as a technological solution that could readily be done in future locations to increase local cultural 
relevance.  During month 2, new videos will be shot in [LOCATION_001] and Atlanta that are similar in content to 
current KIU! videos using the existing “man on the street” style. In month 3, the videos will be edited by [CONTACT_738955].  All other content was deemed by [CONTACT_738956]. 
During months  2-[ADDRESS_1009945]-effectively delivered in eHealth interventions, and a recent online HIV prevention trial 
suggested the need for boosters as intervention effects degraded by 3 months without them 180. 
Formative research  for KIU! and subsequent interviews with diverse YMSM in the WT Grant study (see 
Preliminary Studies) were used to inform the content of the 6-month booster. The IMB model7 guided our 
development of this session. The boosters provide tailored feedback on achievement of risk reduction goals, 
enhance motivation for risk reduction, and opportunities to strengthen HIV prevention skills. The 3 month 
booster also focuses on the importance of repeat HIV testing following the CDC’s recommendation of twice 
annual HIV testing among MSM 181, which is consistent with our aim to examine effects of the intervention on 
follow-up HIV testing. The [ADDRESS_1009946] technical and 
intervention assumptions.  Once module development is complete, a tabletop review (or “Beta version”) will be 
led by [CONTACT_738957], complete and clear.  We will also conduct usability and acceptability testing with 
12 ethnically diverse YMSM (4 Caucasian, 4 Black, 4 Latino).  An established usability testing protocol will 
assess usability in practice (i.e., across different monitors, bandwidths, etc.) and allow participants to “think out 
loud” as they go through the modules in order to identify navigation and usability issues. Further revisions will 
be performed as necessary.
We will  implement the revised KIU! intervention and take the modules live during month 6.  End-user technical 
support will go into effect.  The modules will be ready for participant enrollment. During month [ADDRESS_1009947] staff on all recruitment, screening, and enrollment

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 12 of 50procedures. FAQs,  flowcharts, and web-based videos will be distributed for training of indigenous CBO clinic 
staff who will perform enrollment activities. 
B.10. Phase  2: A two arm multi-site RCT will be conducted in Months 7 - 54.  
(a) Recruitment.  The team in each city has assembled a cadre of CBOs whose indigenous staff will 
recruit YMSM upon a negative HIV test result (see letters of support from all community partners). We have 
partnered with CBOs for recruitment in order to maximize our ability to test the intervention under conditions in 
which it would eventually be disseminated.  Based on our prior data collection and the need to stay within 
budgetary caps, we project enrollment of 22 YMSM per month. Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_738907] 15 - 45%182-187, we conservatively 
project the RCT enrollment rate to be at least 20% of YMSM screened (inclusive of eligibility requirements). 
Therefore we anticipate needing to screen ~4500 YMSM across all years.  More than this number of tests were 
performed annually across these clinics, but many of these visits represent YMSM repeating testing. Factoring 
this in, along with our plan for equal representation by [CONTACT_98680]/ethnic groups and equal enrollment across cities, 
we project we will be able to readily achieve recruitment goals.
(a2) CBO  Recruitment. At the conclusion of their post-test appointment or rapid-test, YMSM who test HIV 
negative will be given a tablet computer by [CONTACT_738958] (with paper-and-
pencil backup as necessary).  In many cases this will be a nurse, medical assistant, or other individual certified 
to conduct HIV testing. Clients can also be screened online on the Assessment Center platform or offline on 
the iFormBuilder app. The staff member will be trained in appropriate and ethical methods of recruiting 
participants in medical settings. To minimize the risk for coercion, the staff member and the study information 
sheet/screen emphasize the optional nature of participation and that it will not affect, in any way, their access 
to healthcare services. These recruitment procedures were previously approved by [CONTACT_738959], implemented in the KIU! pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and no adverse events were reported.
  
The tablet  (or paper form) will display information about the study, ask the potential participant whether or not 
he wants to consider participation, and ask demographic questions for screening purposes.  If the participant is 
not interested,  the tablet (or paper form) will ask questions assessing reasons for non-participation.  This will 
allow us to  test for potential biases in enrollment. The recruiter will not be asking these questions and the tablet 
(or paper form) will indicate that answering these questions are voluntary. As such, the potential participant 
may simply choose to skip these questions.  For participants who are determined to be eligible, the device will 
ask for  contact [CONTACT_3031].  For participants who are determined to be not eligible, the device will display 
ineligibility information and  ask the participant if he would like to consent to enter his contact [CONTACT_738960]. When paper and pencil are used, participants will provide their contact 
[CONTACT_738961]! or other studies; they will not be aware of their 
eligibility at the time. The tablet (and paper form) includes a question in the contact [CONTACT_738962]. All subjects will have to consent to being added to the 
IMPACT database before research staff approaches them about participating in other studies. Information 
collected on the tablet through Assessment Center will be securely uploaded to the tracking system.  
Information collected on the tablet using the iFormBuilder app will be exported to a CSV file and either the 
information will be uploaded to Assessment Center or manually entered by [CONTACT_44498].  Information 
collected with paper and pencil will be manually entered by [CONTACT_738963]

Contact [CONTACT_738964]) that will include further e-mails, phone calls if a valid phone number was 
provided, and a text message (if consent provided). Following recommendations for Internet-based research 97, 
inclusion criteria will not be posted, but instead measured directly, in order to reduce potential for participant 
deception in order to gain incentives.
(a3) Expanded Recruitment.  Recruitment from the CBOs will be supplemented by [CONTACT_738965], street outreach, 
referrals of participants from ongoing studies and participants who have consented to being added to IRB 
approved research participant registries at the university sites, referrals from the Chicago Department of Public 
Health (CDPH) clinics, and referrals of participants from community partners who provide HIV testing. In 
addition to the CBO sites, Emory University and Hunter College will offer HIV testing to participants recruited 
through these expanded recruitment methods. Participants who visit these university sites will be tested by 
[CONTACT_738966] a CBO.
Staff members across all testing  sites will be trained in appropriate and ethical methods of recruiting 
participants in medical settings. To minimize the risk for coercion, the staff member and the study information 
sheet/screen emphasize the optional nature of participation and that it will not affect, in any way, their access 
to healthcare services. These recruitment procedures were previously approved by [CONTACT_738959], implemented in the KIU! pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and no adverse events were reported.
Northwestern University  and Emory University will also offer at-home HIV testing to participants recruited 
through these expanded recruitment methods. Staff members across all testing sites will use the skills taught 
during their HIV testing and counseling training to help participants cope with any distress related to their test 
results. When necessary, staff members will work with the participant to link them to care and will be available 
to provide counseling support following established organizational procedures.  
1.Recruitment  through online, print, and telephone ads.  The KIU! research assistants will 
place online  recruitment ads on popular sites such as Facebook, Grindr, and Craigslist. 
Additionally, RAs will send private messages to young men on Facebook who “like” or “share” 
the ads that we post on Facebook. These messages will encourage the young men to click the 
link in the ad and complete our online screener if they have not already done so. Samples of the 
messages we will use are included in the “Recruitment-Online & Telephone Ads samples 
5.1.14” document. The RAs will also place recorded recruitment ads on phone party lines like 
Talkee’s Chicago Blade line where YMSM can chat real time in a group or one-on-one or leave 
personal ads for being contact[CONTACT_738967]. Print ads will be created by [CONTACT_738968]. Participants recruited through these ads will be directed to a study webpage for 
detailed project information and a brief eligibility screener. Interested participants will provide 
contact [CONTACT_3031] (name, phone, email address) and complete the screener. 
For those  who screen ineligible, the online screener will ask the participant if he would like to 
consent to enter his contact [CONTACT_738969]. All subjects will have 
to consent to being added to the IMPACT database before research staff approaches them 
about participating in other studies. Information collected from the online screener will be 
exported to a CSV file and either the information will be uploaded to Assessment Center or 
manually entered by [CONTACT_738970] 3 days of receipt. 
For those  who screen eligible, the participant will be asked to confirm his HIV negative status by 
(1) taking an HIV test at a partner CBO testing site or university site (Emory and Hunter) or (2) 
taking an at-home HIV test provided by a university site (Emory and Northwestern).
Participants that  agree to take an at-home HIV test will be mailed an FDA approved at-home 
test kit. Participants will be offered the option of testing with Oraquick (oral swab) or Home 
Access (finger stick). To join the study with an Oraquick at-home HIV test, participants will be

the online screener, to consent to allowing Home Access to share their results with research 
staff. HIV results will be shared between Home Access and Northwestern University via SFTP.  
University staff will use this information to confirm participants’ eligibility for the study. 
Participants who  agree to take either at-home HIV test kit will also be mailed at-home urethral 
and rectal STI test kits.
 
For individuals  with HIV negative test results. 
(a) At  CBO sites: The testing counselor will provide the participant with a tablet (or paper form) 
to complete the full screener and confirm eligibility. If eligible, an enrollment email with a link to 
the study to be sent to the participant’s email address. 
If ineligible, the tablet  (or paper form) will ask the participant if he would like to consent to enter 
his contact [CONTACT_738969]. When paper and pencil are used, 
participants will provide their contact [CONTACT_738971]! or other studies; they will not be aware of their eligibility at the time. The tablet (and paper 
form) includes a question in the contact [CONTACT_738972]. All subjects will have to consent to being added to the 
IMPACT database before research staff approaches them about participating in other studies. 
Information collected on the tablet through Assessment Center will be securely uploaded to the 
tracking system.  Information collected with paper and pencil will be manually entered by 
[CONTACT_738963] 3 days of receipt.
(b) At  university sites (Emory and Hunter): The testing counselor will provide the participant with 
a tablet (or paper form) to complete the full screener and confirm eligibility. If eligible, an 
enrollment email with a link to the study to be sent to the participant’s email address. The testing 
counselor will encourage the participant to complete the baseline assessment and first set of 
self-administered STI test kits at the university site. Upon completion, the participant will be 
compensated $50 in cash. 
If ineligible, the testing  counselor will also let the participant know that he is ineligible for KIU! 
but may be eligible for other studies. If interested in other studies, university staff will collect 
additional contact [CONTACT_738973] (or paper form) to enter into the IMPACT database. The 
participant will also receive $10 in cash for his travel to the university site.
(c) At-home  HIV testing: If the participant tests negative, the project coordinator will call the 
participant to do a full screening over the phone and confirm eligibility. If eligible, an enrollment 
email with a link to the study to be sent to the participant’s email address. Upon completion of 
the baseline assessment, the participant will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1009950] coordinator will let  the participant know that he is ineligible for KIU! but

(a) At  CBO sites: The testing counselor will work with the participant to link them to care and will 
be available to provide counseling support following established organizational procedures.  
Linkage-to-care will include referring the participant to a clinic that will conduct a free 
confirmatory HIV test, and to someone that will work with them receive treatment if their 
confirmatory test returns positive. The testing counselor will also let the participant know that the 
KIU! research assistant will follow-up with them about their eligibility for the study. 
At the conclusion  of the appointment or rapid-test, the testing counselor will call the KIU! 
research assistant and confirm that the participant has tested positive. The KIU! research 
assistant will email the participant to let him know that he is ineligible for KIU! but may be 
eligible for other studies. If the participant is interested in other studies and consents to being 
added to the IMPACT database, the KIU! research assistant will collect additional contact 
[CONTACT_738975].  
(b) At  university sites: 
Emory –  The testing counselor will use the skills taught during their HIV testing and counseling 
training to help participants cope with distress after receiving a positive test result. The testing 
counselor will work with the participant to link them to care and will be available to provide 
counseling support following established organizational procedures.  Linkage-to-care will 
include referring the participant to a clinic that will conduct a free confirmatory HIV test, and to 
someone that will work with them receive treatment if their confirmatory test returns positive. 
Participants under 24 years old will be referred to the Ponce de Leon center at Grady while 
those who are 24 years and older will be referred to their county health department.  After the 
participant has been linked to care, the testing counselor will give the participant $50 in cash for 
travel and time spent being counseled and linked to care. The testing counselor will also let the 
participant know that he is ineligible for KIU! but may be eligible for other studies at Emory. 
Hunter –  The testing counselor will use the skills taught during their HIV testing and counseling 
training to help participants cope with distress after receiving a positive test result. The testing 
counselor will work with the participant to link them to care and will be available to provide 
counseling support following established organizational procedures.  Linkage-to-care will 
include referring the participant to a clinic that will conduct a free confirmatory HIV test, and to 
someone that will work with them receive treatment if their confirmatory test returns positive. 
Participants may be referred to the Mount Sinai Comprehensive Health Program, Callen-Lorde 
Community Health Center, or Gay Men’s Health Crisis Prevention Center. The testing counselor 
and a senior staff member will walk or take a cab with the participant to the HIV confirmatory 
testing clinic.  Before taking the trip to the confirmatory clinic, the testing counselor will give the 
participant $50 in cash for travel and time spent being counseled and linked to care. The testing 
counselor will also let the participant know that he is ineligible for KIU! but may be eligible for 
other studies at Hunter. 
(c) At-home  HIV testing: If the participant tests positive using an Oraquick test kit, the project 
coordinator will work with the participant to link them to care and will be available to provide 
counseling support.  The project coordinator will use established organizational linkage-to-care 
procedures that have been used in other IRB approved studies. Linkage-to-care will include 
referring the participant to a clinic that will conduct a free confirmatory HIV test, and to someone 
that will work with them to receive treatment if their confirmatory test returns positive.  In Atlanta,

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1009953] outreach, the research 
team will obtain  permission from management or owners of venues to recruit for study 
participants. Once permission is granted, university staff and interns will approach potential 
participants in various venues that cater to YMSM (e.g. bars, clubs, bathhouses, and festivals), 
briefly explain the purposes of the study, and invite them to answer questions that screen for 
preliminary eligibility. Individuals will answer questions privately on a tablet (or paper form if a 
tablet is not available). 
Those deemed  eligible after completing the screener will be asked for their contact [CONTACT_3031], 
and will be contact[CONTACT_738976]. University staff will 
offer information about the study over the phone and options for confirming their HIV negative 
status. If a participant wants to visit a partner CBO testing site or university site (Emory and 
Hunter), university staff will schedule an appointment for HIV testing. If a participant wants to 
take an at-home HIV test, university staff will mail out a FDA approved at-home HIV test. 
After taking  an at-home HIV test or testing at a partner CBO testing site or university site (Emory 
and Hunter), participants will follow the same procedure as described under “Recruitment 
through online, print, and telephone ads.” 
For those  who screen ineligible, the device will display ineligibility information and ask the 
participant if he would like to consent to enter his contact [CONTACT_738977]. When paper and pencil are used, participants will provide their contact [CONTACT_738978]! or other studies; they will not be aware of their 
eligibility at the time. The tablet (and paper form) includes a question in the contact [CONTACT_738979]. All subjects will have to 
consent to being added to the IMPACT database before research staff approaches them about 
participating in other studies. Information collected on the tablet through Assessment Center will 
be securely uploaded to the tracking system. Information collected with paper and pencil will be

will follow the same procedure as described under “Recruitment through online, print, and 
telephone ads.” 
5.Recruitment  through CDPH clinics.   At the conclusion of an HIV testing appointment, the 
CDPH staff  member will give male clients who have tested HIV negative, and appear to be 
between the ages of 18 and 29, a brief description of the study. They will mention to the client 
that CDPH is working with Northwestern University researchers on the Keep It Up! study as a 
way to learn more about the health behaviors and outcomes of young men who have sex with 
men (YMSM). The CDPH staff member will briefly mention features of the study, such as it 
being a paid, online HIV prevention research study. To minimize the risk for coercion, the CDPH 
staff member will emphasize the optional nature of participation and that it will not affect, in any 
way, their access to healthcare services. The CDPH staff member will ask the client if he is 
interested in hearing more details about the study and possibly screening to see if he is eligible. 
If the client indicates that he is interested, the CDPH staff member will walk the client over to a 
Keep It Up! staff member who is stationed in another private room at the clinic. CDPH staff 
contact [CONTACT_738980].
The Keep  It Up! staff member will give more details about the study (e.g. randomization, 
timeline, and study components). To minimize the risk for coercion, the staff member will 
reiterate the optional nature of participation and that it will not affect, in any way, their access to 
healthcare services at CDPH. If the client still appears interested, the Keep It Up! staff member 
will invite them to screen for the study. 
The client will complete  the online screener using a computer or tablet (or paper form if 
necessary) in the private room. If eligible, an enrollment email with a link to the study to be sent 
to the participant’s email address. The Keep It Up!  staff member will inform the participant of 
the opportunity to complete the baseline assessment and STI testing while on-site at the clinic. 
If a participant prefers to complete the baseline assessment and STI testing at home, before 
starting the baseline assessment he will complete an online consent form that outlines the at-
home STI testing process. If a participant prefers to complete the baseline assessment and STI 
testing while on-site at the clinic, before starting the baseline assessment, he will complete a 
paper consent form that outlines the STI testing process during clinic visits. 
Most clients  who test for HIV at a CDPH clinic will also have already been tested for urethral 
and rectal STIs as a part of their clinic visit. STI test samples are shipped to University of Illinois 
at Chicago (UIC) lab for analysis. Participants who have already completed STI testing will be 
asked to consent to the clinic’s UIC lab sharing their results with study staff via fax.  It typi[INVESTIGATOR_738908] 3 – 7 days for the return of results. CDPH staff will be responsible for providing these

completing the baseline assessment, the participant will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1009956] not completed STI testing as indicated by [CONTACT_1758] (i.e., urethral and rectal 
testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea) during their clinic visit or decline to consent to the clinic’s 
UIC lab sharing their test results will have the option to take the test kits home, be mailed the 
test kits by [CONTACT_738981], or self-administer the test kits while still on site at the CDPH clinic. 
Clients who  take the kits home or have the kits mailed to their home will also have to complete 
the baseline assessment at home. These clients will complete the online consent form before 
beginning the baseline assessment, self-administer the STI tests, and mail the completed kits to 
the CDC for analysis. Upon receipt of their test kits by [CONTACT_6750], they will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1009957] session of the intervention. 
For participants  who choose to self-administer the STI tests on-site at the CDPH clinic, the 
completed kits will be mailed by [CONTACT_738982]. Samples that are 
not mailed out the same day will be stored in a locked storage cabinet by [CONTACT_738983] 7 days before being mailed to the CDC. Upon completing the baseline assessment 
and STI testing, the participant will be compensated $[ADDRESS_1009958] session of the intervention. 
Keep It  Up! staff will be trained in appropriate and ethical methods of recruiting participants in 
medical settings. All Keep It Up! staff will complete Human Subjects Research CITI training 
before taking part in any recruitment, consenting, or enrollment activities. CDPH staff contact 
[CONTACT_738984], such as collecting informed consent, for which Northwestern University 
requires Human Subjects CITI Training. CDPH staff will be trained by [CONTACT_738985]! staff through 
PowerPoint presentation and handouts on the background, rationale, and set up of the study. 
CDPH staff will also be given a verbal script with basic study information that they can use to 
refer participants to the study. The importance of emphasizing the optional nature of 
participation and that it will not affect, in any way, clients’ access to healthcare services will be 
stressed during CDPH staff trainings. The CDPH supervising physician, who will also act as the 
study liaison, has also completed Human Subjects Research CITI training and will be able to 
offer ongoing guidance to CDPH staff on appropriate ways to refer clients to the study.
Eligible participants  across all study sites will be offered the opportunity to visit Emory University, Hunter 
College, or Northwestern University to complete the baseline assessment and complete their first set of self-
administered STI test kits. 
(b) Intensive  efforts will be put into tracking and retaining participants across waves using 
procedures proven effective in our previous online and offline longitudinal studies. Retention has been 
identified as one of the greatest challenges to Internet-based HIV prevention research, with early studies 
reporting poor retention rates (30-40%)101. Recent studies have improved retention into the 80% range, even 
across one year189, by [CONTACT_738986] E-raffles and providing financial incentives for survey completion 
101.  Using these approaches in our R34 resulted in 89% retention at 3-months. In Project Q2 and Crew 450, 
we used similar approaches and obtained >80% retention of YMSM over several years. Building on this 
experience we will assure a high retention rate by: (a) maintaining up-to-date contact [CONTACT_738987] E-raffle (i.e. link that must be clicked within 48 hours to be entered in raffle to 
win $[ADDRESS_1009959]). This requires minimal participant effort and quickly identifies inactive 
contact [CONTACT_3031].  (b)  utilize our established contact [CONTACT_738988] (see attached Contact [CONTACT_738989]) for inactive contact [CONTACT_738990].  (c) Participant incentives will be

(d) The tracking system for the project will be customized to record all contacts with participants and provide 
alerts when more intense follow-up is required.
(b1) We  will respectfully contact [CONTACT_738991].  Participants will be contact[CONTACT_738992].  Setting limits to the number of attempted contacts is not 
helpful for recruiting and retaining difficult to reach populations in research, such as YMSM.   We have 
used these procedures in our previous studies with no complaints from study participants.
(b2) Overview  of the Contact [CONTACT_738993]/enrollment:
1. If  a client is eligible and interested in participating in the study, he will automatically be sent an 
email from Assessment Center with a link to the baseline assessment. 
2. If  a client does not click on the link or respond to the email within [ADDRESS_1009961] reminder email and text 
message, Assessment Center will send out another reminder email at the following intervals: [ADDRESS_1009962] coordinator is 
unable to reach the client with one call, s/he may make additional phone call attempts.
3. If  a client has not responded after these attempts at contact [INVESTIGATOR_431323] (supplemented by [CONTACT_738994]), the project coordinator, at his/her discretion, may send out additional 
reminders using the client’s preferred contact [CONTACT_738995] 3 days.  
(b3) Overview  of the Contact [CONTACT_738996]
1. Participants  will be sent at home STI test kits at baseline and [ADDRESS_1009963] kit by [CONTACT_738997]’s to be 
received, the project coordinator will email and, if permitted, text the participant the next day to 
remind him to return the test kit. If a participant has not returned his test kit after [ADDRESS_1009964] coordinator will send another reminder using the participant’s preferred 
method of contact. The project coordinator will call the participant if he has not returned his kit 
[ADDRESS_1009965] coordinator, at his/her discretion may make 
additional calls every [ADDRESS_1009966] coordinator, at his/her discretion may call or give additional reminders using the 
participant’s preferred method of contact [INVESTIGATOR_135] [ADDRESS_1009967] 
coordinator can make additional attempts for the duration of the study unless the participant 
explicitly asks to no longer be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

3. Participants  will be contact[CONTACT_738999].
(c) Intervention delivery.  Upon enrollment, participants will randomly assigned by [CONTACT_739000]! or the HIV knowledge control arm. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_739001].  Stratifying by [CONTACT_739002]/ethnicity in each 
condition to address Aim 3—exploring potential racial/ethnic differences in outcome effects.  Stratification by 
[CONTACT_739003]190. After the pre-test assessment and remote STI testing, participants will receive the intervention 
content across three sessions across a minimum of 3 days and a maximum of 3 weeks, based on principles of 
effective HIV interventions and high acceptability in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] (see preliminary studies). The existing 
booster session will be delivered at 3 months, and the newly created booster session content at 3 and 6 
months. 
(d) Self-Reported Measures. Participants will  complete self-report assessments at baseline, 
immediately post-intervention, and 3-, 6-, and 12- months post-intervention. Immediately after the interventions 
are complete, an assessment of intervention acceptability and tolerability will take place along with an 
assessment of HIV knowledge (which will not be repeated to reduce practice effects). We have elected to 
conduct an immediate post-test assessment for 4 reasons: (1) It will allow us to make a payment to participants 
after completion of the intervention modules, which will increase retention and verification of contact 
[CONTACT_3031]; (2) it will allow us to assess acceptability and tolerability of the intervention immediately post-
completion, while the content and style are still fresh to participants; (3) it will allow us to test immediate gains 
in knowledge to evaluate how well intervention material was learned using the online format; and (4) these 
procedures are consistent with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_738909]. The next assessments will occur at 3, 6, and 12-month post-intervention, allowing us to collect 
outcome data, provide a participant payment that will aid in retention, and to deliver booster sessions focused 
on reviewing and refining risk reduction goals and consolidating and reinforcing intervention messages.  In all 
cases assessment will occur prior to boosters to prevent contagion from proximal booster material. We follow 
participants to [ADDRESS_1009970]-evidence (tier I) HIV prevention program by [CONTACT_6750]13.
Similar procedures  and measures successfully used in the developmental study will be employed. 
Assessments will be completed via the Internet using a Computer-Assisted Self Interview (CASI). We will 
administer knowledge/information based measures immediately post-intervention along with the measures of 
intervention acceptability and tolerability.  Motivation, skills (i.e. partner sexual communication, correct condom 
use), and behavioral outcomes (i.e. number of insertive and receptive unprotected anal sex acts, condom 
errors) will be measured at all follow-up points. Whenever possible, we selected measures: (1) designed for 
high-risk YMSM to maximize sensitivity, (2) previously tested with diverse populations to minimize cultural bias, 
and (3) to maximize comparability to other studies in order to compare findings.  All measures and a table 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_738910]-point can be found in Appendix 2.  Participants will be paid for 
completing assessment waves (~30 minute duration; See Budget Justification). As we have done successfully 
in prior  online studies, participants will be given the option of receiving payment in person or via mail.

BL 3 6 12*The brief HIV/AIDS  Knowledge questionnaire  assess knowledge of transmission and prevention 
193. It has strong internal consistency, test-retest stability193, and has been used successfully with 
young adults194.  A total correct score will be used in analyses.   
*HIV/AIDS Motivation and  Behavioral Skills195 assesses: Motivation (e.g. intentions to use 
condoms, perceived threat of HIV or STI infection, motivation to become safer), Social Norms 
(e.g., partners, friends, or family members opi[INVESTIGATOR_738911]), and Behavioral Skills 
(e.g. self-efficacy, negotiating condom use). Internal reliability alphas range from .73 to .94 and 
the measure has been used and developed for MSM. *Behavioral skills also include: the Condom 
Errors Questionnaire196, that assesses condom use errors within the last 3 months (e.g. using oil-
based lubricant). The scale has been found to be predictive of condom breakage and 
slippage197,198 and has been used with YMSM199,200.
*The Health  Protective Communication Scale   measures how respondents discuss health 
protection with their sex partners.  It has been used with diverse adolescent and young adult 
samples (alpha = .84 in a national sample201).  
Intervention acceptability  
and tolerability
PostDeveloped by  [CONTACT_739004]140, it includes a combination of open-ended questions 
(e.g. “What aspect of the program did you like the least?”) and closed-ended Likert-style 
questions that form a scale of intervention acceptability (alpha = .87).  
Dose, engagement,  and 
process
During InterventionIntervention dose  will be defined as the number of module and booster sessions completed. 
Although time logged into the intervention will be tracked, it is a poor proxy for engagement as 
individuals may stay logged in even when not engaged and a “time out” function only partially 
rectifies this. To measure engagement we will track key activities within modules (e.g. 
interactions within games) and develop a score based on participant deviations from sample 
average engagement. We will include measures related to the process of the intervention, such 
as the environment where participants complete the modules (i.e. location, level of privacy, etc.) 
and reasons for non-participation in the study; and at the end of each assessment we will ask 
participants if they have experienced any adverse events as a result of their participation in the 
study (see Human Subjects).Other MeasuresDemographics and  reading 
ability
BLWe will use  standard measures of age, ethnicity, education, and socio-economic status. YMSM-
specific items include gender identity, sexual orientation identity, and anatomic sex at birth. 
Reading ability at or above an 8th grade level will be assessed during the screening questionnaire 
using an adaptation of portions of the Peabody Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17122]-Revised used 
successfully in the R34 202.  
(e) Exit  Interviews: We have created a short exit interview script to collect qualitative data from 
participants after  they complete their final [ADDRESS_1009973] 20 exit interviews 
by [CONTACT_739005]’ thoughts on the intervention and its effect on their behavior. Ten participants will 
be randomly selected from a pool of intervention completers who responded well to the intervention (defined as 
a reduction in condomless anal sex acts at 12-month follow-up) and ten participants will be randomly selected 
from a pool of intervention completers  who did not respond well to the intervention (defined as no change or 
an increase in condomless anal sex acts at 12-month follow-up). By [CONTACT_739006], we will be able to better understand differences in participants’ experiences that 
may have contributed to whether or not the intervention changed their behavior. We will record the interviews 
by [CONTACT_739007] a handheld digital recording device. Before beginning the 
exit interviews, the study team will ask participants for verbal consent that they agree to complete the exit 
interview and have the conversation recorded. Participants will be reminded that all of the information they 
provide during the exit interview is confidential and that they can refuse to answer any questions that they do 
not feel comfortable answering. The study team will transcribe the audio and review responses for feedback on 
the intervention. The information gained from the qualitative interviews will be used to continue to refine the 
intervention in future iterations.  It will also help the study team to understand whether or not participants find it 
acceptable to complete and return biological samples for STI testing, which will inform future research efforts. 
The interview will take 10 – 15 minutes to complete and participants will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_1009974] as 
thanks for their time and participation. 
(f) Repeat  STI Interviews: Preliminary data analysis indicates that a subset of KIU participants tested 
positive for rectal STIs  more than once during the study. We plan to continue refining the KIU program in future 
research, so we are interested in getting a better understanding of what factors are contributing to repeat STIs

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1009975] interviews by [CONTACT_739008]’ experiences getting 
tested for and seeking treatment for rectal STIs, including their reactions to testing positive for a rectal STI, 
how it influenced their thinking and behavior, and their experiences related to seeking treatment (e.g., barriers 
to seeking treatment, doctors’ reactions). We will record the interviews by [CONTACT_739009] a handheld digital recording device. Before beginning the interviews, the study team will 
describe the potential risks and benefits associated with participating in the interview, describe how we handle 
privacy and confidentiality, and ask participants for verbal consent to participate in the interview and to have it 
audio recorded. Participants will be reminded that all of the information they provide during the interview is 
confidential and that they can refuse to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable answering. The 
study team will transcribe the audio and conduct qualitative data analyses in order to identify themes in 
responses. The information gained from the qualitative interviews will help to broaden our understanding of risk 
for repeat rectal STIs, including identifying factors that may be barriers to accessing treatment. This information 
has the potential to inform future development of HIV/STI prevention interventions for this population. The 
interview will take 10-15 minutes to complete and participants will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_1009976] as 
thanks for their time and participation. Participants who are difficult to reach (defined as non-responsive to [ADDRESS_1009977] attempts) will be offered a $[ADDRESS_1009978] been shown to increase 
participation among difficult to reach and non-responsive participants in other research studies without 
perceptions of coercion. 
(g) Timed  Post-Release Testing: We will use time spent on intervention and booster sessions as a proxy 
for participant engagement  and as a means to refine future implementations of KIU!. In order to determine a 
baseline measurement for the amount of time it takes to complete each intervention and booster session, we 
will recruit 20 participants via online social media and application ads. We are recruiting participants who meet 
the same eligibility requirements as the 900 participants who were enrolled into the KIU! intervention. Potential 
participants will click the ad, fill out a screener, and, if eligible, provide contact [CONTACT_3031]. They will then be 
contact[CONTACT_426] a KIU! study staff who will describe KIU! in greater detail. If they are still interested in participating 
in the timed post-release testing, a research assistant will email potential participants a link to an online 
consent form. Once the participant has consented, a research assistant will email them a unique link to the first 
intervention session. Participants will be given ten days to complete the three intervention sessions and 3- and 
6- month booster sessions. Each session takes about 30 minutes to complete. After participants complete the 
6 month booster session, study staff will call participants to complete a 10 – 15 minute exit interview. 
Participants will be reminded that the conversation will be recorded, all of the information they provide during 
the exit interview is confidential, and that they can refuse to answer any questions that they do not feel 
comfortable answering. The study team will transcribe the audio and review responses for feedback on the 
intervention. The information gained from the qualitative exit interviews will be used to continue to refine the 
intervention in future iterations. Overall, participants will spend approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes 
completing study activities (2 ½ hours for the online intervention and booster sessions, and 10 – 15 minutes for 
the phone exit interview). Participants must complete the intervention, two booster sessions, and phone exit 
interview to be mailed a physical $[ADDRESS_1009979].
(h) STI biomarkers: Our approach  to the distance STI testing follows Sullivan’s effective protocol for 
the Checking  In Study (see C.2.d).  To test for STIs, we utilize at-home urine collection kits and at-home rectal 
swab test kits which both use the FDA approved Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2® Assay204,  a target 
amplification nucleic acid probe test that utilizes target capture for the in vitro qualitative detection and 
differentiation of ribosomal RNA from CT and NG. Gen-Probe reports sensitivity of 98 – 100% and specificity of

Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of STD Prevention Laboratory. 
STI testing  protocol at baseline will vary based on enrollment site.  Participants who enroll off-site (e.g. at home 
or at a library) will be shipped both test kits in a nondescript box. Easy-to-understand instructions for collecting 
and returning the samples will be provided with the kits. In addition to the written instructions provided with the 
rectal STI kit, a private video with instructions for properly collecting the rectal samples will be shared with 
participants. The sample collection kits are identified by [CONTACT_74218].  After the samples are returned through 
the mail and processed by [CONTACT_739010], results will be sent on at least a biweekly basis to Northwestern 
University.    If a specimen is not received within 3 weeks of mailing, an electronic reminder will be sent 
through the medium chosen by [CONTACT_2299] (text message or email) or phone if no preferred medium was 
selected by [CONTACT_2299].  Repeat reminders will be sent in subsequent weeks if the specimen remains 
unreturned and, eventually, telephone follow-up will be used to support participants whose specimens were 
overdue by [ADDRESS_1009980] 
samples for baseline STI testing while at the university site. Easy-to-understand instructions for collecting and 
returning the samples will be provided with the kits. In addition to the written instructions, KIU! staff will be on 
hand to address any concerns or questions that participants have about self-administering the test kits. The 
sample collection kits are identified by [CONTACT_74218]. KIU! staff will mail the STI test samples to the CDC.  After 
the samples are returned through the mail and processed by [CONTACT_739010], results will be sent on at least a 
biweekly basis to Northwestern University. For these participants, the STI testing protocol at all follow-ups will 
be the same one used by [CONTACT_739011]-site.
In most  cases, participants who are recruited on-site at a CDPH clinic will have already completed STI testing 
as a part of their clinic visit. CDPH clinics also test for STIs using the FDA approved APTIMA assay. 
Participants who have already completed STI testing will be asked to consent to the clinic’s UIC lab sharing 
their results with study staff via fax. KIU! staff will call the lab client services and provide the patient name, date 
of birth, and date of specimen collection in order to verify that correct results are sent. In addition, KIU! staff will 
verify the fax number to which the results should be sent. The fax machine to which results will be sent is 
located in the mail room of Northwestern’s Department of Medical Social Sciences (MSS). The MMS office is 
not open to the general public. The office is only accessible to staff with ID cards and invited guests who are 
buzzed into the office. Guests are typi[INVESTIGATOR_738912]. In general, only MSS staff 
access the fax machine. To protect participant’s confidentiality, KIU! staff will ask the lab to confirm the time 
that the fax will be sent so that the results are immediately retrieved from the fax machine. All faxes of results 
will also include a fax cover sheet that describes the confidential nature of the contents and has instructions to 
notify the sender to report any faxes received in error and destroy the misdirected documents. The cover letter 
also warns that any mishandling of the documents, such as copying or dissemination, is illegal. It typi[INVESTIGATOR_738908] 3 – 7 days for the return of results. CDPH staff will be responsible for providing these participants with 
treatment and reporting positive results to appropriate authorities. During instances in which a client has not 
already completed STI testing or declines to consent to the clinic’s UIC lab sharing their test results, university 
staff will offer the client the option to take the test kits home, be mailed the test kits by [CONTACT_738981], or self-
administer the test kits while still on-site at the CDPH clinic. Participants who self-administer at home will be 
responsible for mailing the kits back to the CDC for analysis. Participants who self-administer on-site at the 
CDPH clinic will have their kits mailed by [CONTACT_739012]. 
All STI  results will be manually entered into the study’s REDCap tracking database. In order to avoid data entry 
errors and sharing incorrect results with participants, the study team will do comprehensive checks on logged 
results and the PDFs of results sent to participants (see “C.2.d. Protection against a Breach of Confidentiality” 
for more details).

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 24 of 50If a  participant’s specimen is positive, the Physician of Record at the CDC reviews the results before releasing 
to participants.  We will deliver test results to participants using a secure, encrypted email. To open the email 
and access their results, participants must enter the study ID that was provided to them with their test kit. They 
will be able to download and print out a hard copy of their results.  Participants may speak to research staff if 
they wish. With positive test results for chlamydia or gonorrhea, research study staff will: (1) encourage 
participants to notify current and past sex partners; (2) provide local referrals for free or low cost treatment; and 
(3) make a legally required confidential report to the appropriate health department. Health department 
professionals (or disease information specialists) may contact [CONTACT_739013]. STI testing and results will 
also be self-reported at behavioral assessment time points throughout the follow-up period to determine if a 
participant tested positive and was treated prior to the 12-month STI test. 
B.11. RCT  Analytic Plan. This is a two-group, active-control, RCT of an online intervention. The study’s 
hypothesis concerns between-group differences in the change in HIV/STI risk behavior and STI incidence from 
pre-intervention to later follow-ups. There are [ADDRESS_1009981] outcomes: baseline, 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1009982] descriptive analyses will be conducted to 
check for invalid values, outliers, and logical consistency between variables. We will assess the comparability 
of the experimental and control groups at baseline. If any variables differ significantly at baseline, they will be 
included as covariates in the adjusted outcome analyses along with variables known from prior research (e.g. 
age) to be correlated with the outcome under analysis.  Following extensive data description and analysis at 
separate follow-up points, the primary analysis will utilize all follow-up points by [CONTACT_739014]. A lso known as hierarchical linear models (HLM) 205-207, these models allow for the presence of missing 
data, time-varying or invariant covariates, and subject measurement at different time points.  HLM models 
appropriate to the characteristics of the distribution (i.e. normal, Poisson) will be fit using SAS. 
The primary behavioral outcome measure of treatment success will be the count of unprotected anal sex acts 
and the biomedical endpoint will be NG/CT incidence (Aim 2). Secondary outcomes include: condom errors, IMB 
factors, and receipt of an HIV test. We will also explore intervention effects separately for receptive and insertive 
anal sex. The primary independent variable of interest is t he indicator
 for the intervention group. The baseline 
value of the outcome and other required covariates at baseline  will be included as additional independent 
variables. The intervention will recruit participants from multiple sites (multiple clinics in three cities); however it 
is not delivered in groups so site will be adjusted for as a fixed rather than a random independent variable. A 
random intercept term will be included to account for individual average levels of the outcome. The effect of 
time will first be estimated as a categorical variable in order to describe and adjust for time trends as observed. 
A second strategy will start with estimating a single slope reflecting average change across all [ADDRESS_1009983] averaged across all time points, adjusting for all included 
covariates and underlying time trends. Potential moderators (race/ethnicity, relationships status, and 
gay/bisexual identity) will be added as independent variables and their interactions with intervention group will be 
tested (Aim 3). Addition of interaction terms between time and intervention group will provide a test for 
comparing time trends in change scores between groups.
Analysis of all available measurements among all participants regardless of dose is consistent with an “intent-to-
treat” perspective172. It is desirable to also perform an analysis which considers the “dose” and engagement in 
the intervention. We will use Rubin’s
 causal modeling to consider dose-effect when making comparisons across 
the two groups208,209. Further, in our HLM models, missing data is assumed to be missing at random conditional 
on the independent variables in the model; therefore we are in effect assuming that participants with incomplete 
measurements would have been similar to others in their group (their same covariate values) with complete 
measurements.

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 25 of 50B.12. Power  and Sample Size. All power calculations were performed in R version 2.14.0 and using common 
sample size formula for repeated measures210 with nominal Type I error rates (i.e. α=.05)  and effect estimates 
based on our preliminary studies. We will screen approximately 4500 YMSM, enroll 900 YMSM, and assume 
80% retention based on our preliminary studies.  Assuming participants are randomized to two groups in equal 
proportions, we will have 97% power to detect a 11% reduction in the rate of unprotected sex (ERR = 0.89) 
due to the intervention, assuming the correlation between repeated measures is 0.8.  The correlation among 
repeated measures plays an important role in the calculation; in this case, our power calculation is 
conservative if the correlation among repeated measures is, in fact, weaker than 0.8.  The smallest effect size 
with which we will have 80% power to detect is a 6.5% reduction in the rate of unprotected sex. Technically 
speaking, our study will have greater power than what is reported here after we adjust for our blocked design. 
In conclusion, we will have 80% power to detect an effect size equal to half of what we observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_738913]26.  
For our primary biomedical endpoint of STI incidence, we assume the annual incidence based on our 
longitudinal cohort studies in the range of 10 to 15%.  If the incidence rate in the control group is 10%, we will 
have 81%, 70%, and 56% power to detect an incidence reduction of 7%, 6%, and 5%, respectively.  If the 
incidence rate in the control group is higher, say 15%, then the power reduces to 71%, 60%, and 47%, 
respectively.  The objective of aim [ADDRESS_1009984] interactions, treatment by 
[CONTACT_6496].  For a conservative power calculation, we repeated the power calculations as per aim 1 with a 
reduced sample size. Assuming N=200 per group (say, for racial/ethnic subgroups), an ERR=0.89 as above, 
and strong correlation among repeated measures (i.e. 0.8), we will have 91%, 85%, and 77% power to detect a 
10%, 9%, and 8% reduction in the rate of unprotected sex among YMSM, respectively, due to KIU! 
intervention.  The power will be less for effect sizes more subtle than 8% and less for smaller subgroups.  In 
addition to racial/ethnic subgroups, other subgroups of interest include sexual orientation identity groups (81% 
gay, 17% bisexual identified) and relationship groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839] (30% recent serious relationships). The power for 
each subgroup comparison will be similar to the power described above.  
B.13. There  are several alternatives to the design proposed here that deserve consideration. First, is the 
linkage of the online intervention to HIV testing, instead of recruiting YMSM online (e.g. banner ads). Online 
recruitment has been used extensively for other online HIV behavioral research projects with MSM41,101, but 
with a few important exceptions these studies have had difficulties with recruitment of racial/ethnic minorities 
and with longitudinal retention. We believe that linking to HIV testing is an innovative method to help overcome 
these issues while simultaneously addressing the increasing lack of prevention counseling in this context. 
Furthermore, it advances the science of linking eHealth intervention into clinical encounters, which can then be 
applied to the inclusion of eHealth prevention in future biomedical prevention strategies (e.g. PrEP). Second, 
we considered using HIV status as a trial outcome. We ruled out this alternative for two reasons: a) by 
[CONTACT_739015], seroconversions across one year would be a rare event and 
therefore require a cost prohibitive sample size (N > 4,500),  and b) conducting HIV testing as part of the study 
would not allow us to include elective testing as a trial outcome. 
C. HUMAN  SUBJECTS
C.1. RISKS  TO HUMAN SUBJECTS
C.1.a. Human  Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design.  We will screen 4532 ethnically diverse 
18–[ADDRESS_1009985] sex with men (YMSM) following an HIV negative test result from 
community clinics in Chicago, [LOCATION_001], and Atlanta or at a university site (Emory and Hunter). (This total 
sample includes 12 YMSM who will participate in acceptability and usability testing prior to implementation.)  
About 20% of these young men (n = 900) are anticipated to enroll into and complete the study. Investigators 
with a history of successfully conducting HIV behavioral research will be supervising research in these cities. 
Three academic institutions (Northwestern University, Hunter College, and Emory University) with exemplary 
human subjects protection programs will be involved in participant recruitment. The investigative team has 
extensive experience conducting research and providing services to YMSM.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_738914] a member of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and has expertise in ethical issues related to 
conducting research with sexual minority youth211.

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 26 of 50MSM will  range in age from 18-29 years, consistent with findings regarding emerging adulthood as a period of 
heightened risk for STIs/HIV among MSM15,212-214. We will recruit a racially and ethnically diverse sample, 
representing both high-risk YMSM in Chicago, Atlanta, and [LOCATION_001], as well as the demographics of the 
population seeking services at each recruitment site. As described in the research design, the size and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_738904]/AIDS epi[INVESTIGATOR_738915].  These cities represent distinct geographical regions (i.e. Midwest, Southeast, East Coast) 
with notable differences in population demographics and culture. This diversity will allow examination of 
whether the intervention works equally well in a variety of urban settings, thus increasing our ability to draw 
conclusions about the generalizability of findings. Given site-specific recruitment patterns, we will readily 
achieve representation across White, Black, and Latino groups, but we will also stratify enrollment to equal 1/3 
for each group). Each site will screen approximately 1250 YMSM and enroll approximately 250 YMSM.  
Inclusion and exclusion  criteria: We will include participants in the study if they: (1) MSM, defined as a birth 
male who identifies as  male and who self-reports having sexual contact [CONTACT_738951]; (2) 
received an HIV negative test result from a participating clinic/recruitment site; (3) are 18-29 years old; and (4) 
had unprotected anal sex with another male in the last 6 months. YMSM will not be enrolled in the study if they: 
(1) do  not have an e-mail address that can be used to contact [CONTACT_739016]; (2) are currently in 
a behaviorally monogamous relationship lasting longer than 6 months. We use this criterion because we 
believe safer sex interventions for MSM in long-term monogamous relationships will require substantial 
tailoring from those who are single or in the early phases of a relationship; (3) did not have unprotected anal 
sex with another male in the last [ADDRESS_1009986] intervention effects on behavior at follow-up; (4) HIV positive serostatus at time of enrollment. We have 
elected to exclude HIV+ individuals because we believe that secondary prevention messages may need to be 
different than primary prevention messages.  Nevertheless, if a participant seroconverts during the course of 
the study, he will be allowed to continue participating (with appropriate adjustment in the analyses). We will 
also refer him for HIV services (see below); and (5) since the measures and intervention are delivered in 
English, participants must be able to read English at a minimum 8th grade level.  Our developmental R34 KIU! 
data, and data on client flow at our recruitment sites, suggest that despi[INVESTIGATOR_738916]. 
YMSM will  participate in either usability and acceptability tests in phase [ADDRESS_1009987] in phase 2. 
In phase  1 (months 1-6), we will perform necessary technological upgrades to the tracking system, program 
additional booster modules, conduct usability testing, and prepare for the RCT. Twelve ethnically diverse 
YMSM (4 Caucasian, 4 African American, 4 Latino) will participate in usability and acceptability testing of new 
booster session and the existing modules that will be updated with video interviews conducted in [LOCATION_001] 
and Atlanta. A testing protocol established by [CONTACT_739017] (CBIT) will be used to assess usability across standards (i.e. across different monitors, 
bandwidths, etc.) and in practice with target participants who will “think out loud” and be observed as they go 
through the modules (i.e. ability to navigate, cultural appropriateness).  Participants in usability testing will be 
reimbursed $35 in cash for approximately 90 minutes of their time and for travel expenses.   
In phase  2 (months 7 – 48), [ADDRESS_1009988] phase of the study. About 20% of these 
young men (n = 900) are anticipated to enroll into and complete the study.  Participants will be automatically 
randomized into the experimental intervention (KIU!) or the control condition (HIV Knowledge) after verification 
of participant eligibility and completion of informed consent online. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_739018].  In both arms of the trial we will test for Gonorrhea (NG) and Chlamydia (CT), using the at-
home rectal swab test kits and at-home urine test kits, and refer for treatment as necessary at baseline and 
post-intervention. In the experimental condition, participants will have already received HIV testing and 
counseling, and in the context of the proposed study will receive the highly-interactive and YMSM-tailored 
Internet-based prevention program called Keep It Up! (KIU!). Consistent with meta-analytic data on effective 
HIV interventions, the content will be delivered over three sessions across a three week period (see Appendix 
IRB #: STU00073433 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 8/22/2017 through 8/21/2018.

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 27 of 501 for  intervention overview).  Participants in the KIU! arm will also receive booster sessions at 3- and 6--months 
from completion of the intervention.  These sessions continue to provide HIV prevention motivation and 
behavioral skills training.
In the  control condition, participants will also have already received HIV testing and counseling. In the context 
of this study they will receive the HIV-information modules that focus on facts about HIV and STIs.  There are 
similarly [ADDRESS_1009989] like the KIU! arm, must be completed across three 
sessions.  YMSM in this control arm will receive booster sessions at 3- and 6-months that provide further facts 
about HIV and STIs.
We acknowledge  the importance of considering the ethical ramifications of delivering an HIV information-only 
control condition to a group at high risk for HIV infection. Ethical objections to randomization with a control 
group generally center around situations where an existing effective intervention exists172.  In the case of online 
HIV prevention with YMSM no such proven-effective intervention exists.  We highlight that in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_738917] a product of their participation, and 
therefore the control group does receive a benefit from participation. We take the view that properly designed 
and conducted RCTs are ethical when they answer important public health questions without impairing the 
welfare of participants who provide informed consent.
Participants in both  conditions will complete all assessment materials.  Similar procedures and measures 
successfully used in the developmental R34 study will be employed. Assessments will be completed via the 
Internet using an Internet-based Computer-Assisted Self Interview (CASI). Assessments will occur at baseline, 
3-,6-, and12-month post intervention. At each log-in to the intervention we will ask about the physical setting 
where the participant is located. We will assess levels of privacy, distractions, and the type of location. At each 
assessment point participants will be asked if they have experienced any adverse events as a result of their 
participation in the program. Endorsement of adverse events will trigger an email alert to the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_738918].  Participants will also be given a contact [CONTACT_739019]. Note that in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_738919].
Each assessment  will take less than [ADDRESS_1009990] done successfully in prior online studies, 
participants will be given the option of receiving payment in person or via mail. Payments will be made after 
each of the following tasks are completed:
1. Baseline  payment will vary based on enrollment site.
a. For  participants who enroll off-site (e.g. at home or at a library), a $[ADDRESS_1009991] kit sample.
b. For  participants who enroll on-site at Emory University, Hunter College, or Northwestern 
University, $[ADDRESS_1009992] samples to the CDC.
c.  For  participants who enroll on-site at a CDPH clinic, $50 in cash will be given after participants 
complete the baseline assessment and STI testing (or consent to the clinic’s UIC lab sharing 
their STI results). We will give these participants a paper consent form upon arrival describing 
the payment they receive for completing the baseline assessment and STI testing on-site at a 
CDPH clinic. 
2. $[ADDRESS_1009993]-intervention assessment.  
3. $20  or $[ADDRESS_1009994] will be given after the participant completes the 3-month booster 
session and assessment. Participants who only complete the 3 month booster session and assessment 
will receive a $[ADDRESS_1009995]. Participants who take at-home STI tests, in addition to 
completing the 3 month booster session and assessment, will receive a $[ADDRESS_1009996].

follow-up is a $[ADDRESS_1010001] kit will be offered a $[ADDRESS_1010002] to reach and non-responsive participants in other 
research studies without perceptions of coercion. Younger participants (18 – 24 years old) also make 
up a larger portion of participants who are hard to reach or non-responsive. Latino and African 
American YMSM make up more than 60% of participants who are hard to reach or non-responsive. As 
these groups are most at risk for HIV, it is very importance to collect outcome data from them as a 
means of seeing how useful the intervention is in reducing risks among groups that are most in need of 
effective HIV prevention interventions.

testing will be given the option to receive payment in cash.

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1010015] used all of the proposed measures with YMSM either in the 
developmental R34 or previous studies with sexual minority young adults.  Whenever possible, we selected 
measures: (1) designed for high-risk YMSM to maximize sensitivity, (2) previously tested with diverse 
populations to minimize cultural bias, and (3) to maximize comparability to other studies in order to compare 
findings.  All measures and a Table depi[INVESTIGATOR_738910]-point can be found in Appendix 2.  
Assessments will be completed via the Internet using an Internet-based Computer-Assisted Self Interview 
(CASI). Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_738920] (see below). 
Questionnaire measures  will assess: HIV/STI risk behavior, alcohol and drug use, HIV/AIDS-related  
knowledge, attitudes, and motivation, condom use errors, safer sex communication and self-efficacy, 
intervention acceptability, tolerability, and process (e.g., where intervention was completed, reasons for non-
participation, and whether they experienced any adverse events as a result of participation). In addition, 
participants will report on their age, ethnicity, education, socio-economic status, and specific YMSM indices of 
gender identity, sexual orientation, and anatomic sex at birth. Social desirability will also be assessed to serve 
as a validity check for self-report responses and reading ability will also be assessed. 
STIs will  be tested for using at home urine collection kits and at-home rectal swab test kits which both use the 
Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2® Assay which detects Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
(NG) to aid in the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal urogenital disease.  For urethral CT and NG, 
Gen-Probe reports sensitivity of 98 – 100% and  specificity of 98 – 100%.  STI testing will be conducted in the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of STD Prevention Laboratory.
C.1.c. Potential  Risks. Potential risks consist of the actual assessment and recruitment process (e.g., 
potential coercion, discomfort or distress during the intervention or assessments), breaches of confidentiality, 
and HIV seroconversion or STI diagnosis during the course of the study. It is possible that certain assessment 
items (e.g. sexual or drug behavior; STI and HIV testing results) may make participants feel uncomfortable.  
There is a small possibility that a participant’s information could be intercepted while in transit over the Internet 
or that data could be hacked from our servers. It is also possible that participants will experience a loss of 
confidentiality if they complete the assessments or intervention modules in a public space. Finally, a participant 
could test positive during the course of the study, however we have established procedures set up at each 
clinic linking participants to services and care (see below). 
C.1.d. Exit  Interview Risks. It is possible that certain questions asked during the interview (e.g., questions 
about the acceptability of rectal STI testing) may make participants feel uncomfortable.  Participants will be 
reminded that they can refuse to answer any questions that they are uncomfortable answering.  There is a 
small possibility that a participant’s interview audio and transcription could be hacked from our servers where 
the files will be saved. It is also possible that participants will experience a loss of confidentiality if they 
complete the exit interview in a public space. We have established procedures to protect against these 
potential risks (see Section C.2.a.8).
C.1.e. Repeat  STI Interview Risks. It is possible that certain questions asked during the interview (e.g., 
questions about STIs) may make participants feel uncomfortable.  Participants will be reminded that they can 
refuse to answer any questions that they are uncomfortable answering.  There is a small possibility that a 
participant’s interview audio and transcription could be hacked from our servers where the files will be saved. It 
is also possible that participants will experience a loss of confidentiality if they complete the exit interview in a 
public space. We have established procedures to protect against these potential risks (see Section C.2.a.9).
C.1.f. Timed  Post-Release Testing Risks. It is possible that some of the content in the intervention modules 
and booster  sessions may make participants feel uncomfortable. Participants will be reminded that they can 
call a research staff member about anything that can come up during the study. We will also refer participants 
to counseling services if they want. They will be reminded that they can stop participating at any time. It is also 
possible that participants my find some questions unpleasant or hard to answer. Participants will be reminded

C.2. ADEQUACY  OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS
C.2.a. Recruitment  and Informed Consent. YMSM who tested HIV negative from our clinic partners will be 
recruited. Co-Investigators in each city have assembled a cadre of CBOs that will recruit YMSM upon a 
negative HIV test result (see letters of support). We have partnered with CBOs for recruitment in order to 
maximize our ability to test the intervention under conditions in which it would eventually be disseminated.  We 
will apply the following recruitment procedures used successfully in our developmental R34; however, we will 
streamline the process and utilize tablet PC devices (with paper-and-pencil option if preferred) to recruit and 
screen participants. 
The consent process  will differ depending on the source from which a participant is recruited. 
(C.2.a.1) CBO  Recruitment.  At the conclusion of their post-test appointment or rapid-test, YMSM who test HIV 
negative will be given a tablet computer by [CONTACT_738958] (with paper-and-
pencil backup as necessary).  Clients can be screened online on the Assessment Center platform or offline on 
the iFormBuilder app. The tablets (or paper form) will display information about the study, ask the potential 
participant demographic questions, and whether or not he wants to be contact[CONTACT_66696]. If so, the 
device (or paper form) will ask for contact [CONTACT_3031].  If not, the tablet (or paper form) will ask questions 
assessing reasons for nonparticipation.  When paper and pencil are used, participants will provide their contact 
[CONTACT_738961]! or other studies; they will not be aware of their 
eligibility at the time. An alteration of consent and waiver of documentation will be requested from the IRBs for 
this screener. Information collected on the tablet will be encrypted on the device and securely transmitted to 
the Assessment Center server by [CONTACT_3655]. Device log-ins will prevent unauthorized access to the encrypted 
information on the device. Information collected on the tablet using the iFormBuilder app will be exported to a 
CSV file and either the information will be uploaded to Assessment Center or manually entered by [CONTACT_165401]. The CSV files will be password protected. Information collected with paper and pencil will be 
manually entered by [CONTACT_738963] [ADDRESS_1010017] an e-mail with more information about the study 
and told that they can use Internet-enabled computers at their local recruitment site for free.  The research 
coordinator based in Chicago, Atlanta, and [LOCATION_001] will be on hand to provide training and support to testing

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 32 of 50staff to  assure easy compliance with this recruitment procedure. Potential participants will be sent a 
recruitment e-mail to the address entered into the tablet (or on paper form); we will solicit email addresses that 
are checked regularly. The participant will be given the option to immediately be considered for participation, 
defer participation to a specified later date within 4 weeks (e.g. a vacation preclude immediate enrollment), or 
have their information removed from the contact [INVESTIGATOR_56905]. Non-response to the recruitment e-mail after 4 days 
will trigger the retention protocol that will include further e-mails, phone calls if a valid phone number was 
provided, a text message (if consent provided).  Individuals who wish to be considered for participation will 
complete a brief online questionnaire that will assess inclusion criteria, and if eligible will be enrolled and 
directed to the baseline survey.
The only data  collected prior to informed consent will be screening data used to assure eligibility and reasons 
for non-participation.  Consent will be conducted online using procedures that have previously been IRB 
approved and used successfully in our developmental R34 (see Preliminary Studies). The consent document 
will be written to Federal OHRP standards with 8th grade or below reading level.  The consent statements will 
have the required elements of informed consent, including (a) a description of the study and the amount of time 
required for participation; (b) acknowledgment that participation is voluntary and that no negative 
consequences will occur for those who choose not to participate; (c) acknowledgment of the participant’s right 
to withdraw at any time; (d) guarantee of confidentiality unless any person is in danger of injury; (e) a 
statement of payment, including amount and circumstances under which the respondent would not be paid 
(including early withdrawal from the study); and (f) contact [CONTACT_739022]. 
(C.2.a.2) Recruitment  through online, print, and telephone ads.  Participants recruited through these ads 
will be directed to a study webpage for detailed project information and a brief eligibility screener. The 
participant is then asked if he is willing to complete the brief Eligibility Screener to determine if he is eligible to 
participate.  
If he  consents by [CONTACT_542590], his consent will be saved in a CSV file and later manually entered and saved 
into Assessment Center database as a data point. Once consent is given, the online Eligibility Screener form 
asks questions about demographics, including age, sex, sexual orientation, relationship status, and sexual 
behaviors. If the participant appears to be eligible, he will be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_739023]-up and help him schedule an HIV test at a testing site or mail him an at-home HIV test kit to 
confirm his HIV negative status. 
Participants who  choose to receive an at-home HIV test kit will be presented with an online consent addendum 
in the brief eligibility online screener. Participants who choose to be mailed a Home Access at-home specimen 
collection kit will be asked to consent to allowing Home Access to share their results with university staff. HIV 
results will be shared between Home Access and Northwestern University via SFTP.  Participants who choose 
to be mailed an Oraquick at-home HIV test will be asked to call university staff to report their results. University 
staff will use this information to confirm participants’ eligibility for the study. If a participant does not consent to 
share his results with university staff, he will be told that he is unable to participate in the study without 
confirming his HIV status with university staff. 
For participants  who visit testing site. 
After the  participant takes an HIV test and confirms his HIV negative status, the testing counselor will provide 
the participant with a tablet (or paper form) to complete the full screener and confirm eligibility. If eligible, an 
email with a study link to be sent to the participant. After clicking this link, the participant will provide online 
consent before beginning the study.  Participants read through our online consent form and click either "I 
Agree" or "Decline". Their responses are collected and stored in the Assessment Center database.
If the  participant is ineligible, the online screener (or paper form) will ask if the participant would like to be

After the  participant collects his blood specimen, he will mail it back to Home Access for analysis. The 
participant must use the pre-paid and pre-addressed envelope provided by [CONTACT_739024]. After shippi[INVESTIGATOR_738921], the participant will call a toll-free number after seven days to 
receive his test results and post-test counseling. Home Access will also share the results with Northwestern 
University via SFTP. If the participant tests negative, the project coordinator will call the participant to do a full 
screening over the phone and confirm eligibility. If eligible, an enrollment email with a link to the study to be 
sent to the participant’s email address. After clicking this link, the participant will provide online consent before 
beginning the study.  Participants read through our online consent form and click either "I Agree" or "Decline". 
Their responses are collected and stored in the Assessment Center database.
If ineligible, the project coordinator will let  the participant know that he is ineligible for KIU! but may be eligible 
for other studies. If the participant is interested in other studies, the project coordinator will collect additional 
contact [CONTACT_739025]. All subjects will have to consent to being added to the 
IMPACT database.
For participants  who take at-home test (OraQuick) 
After the  participant takes an at-home HIV test, he will be required to interpret his test result by [CONTACT_739026][INVESTIGATOR_738922]. After determining his test result, the participant 
will need to call study staff and report his test result. If the test result is negative, the project coordinator will do 
a full screening with the participant over the phone and confirm eligibility. If eligible, an enrollment email with a 
link to the study to be sent to the participant’s email address. After clicking this link, the participant will provide 
online consent before beginning the study.  Participants read through our online consent form and click either 
"I Agree" or "Decline". Their responses are collected and stored in the Assessment Center database.
If ineligible, the project coordinator will let  the participant know that he is ineligible for KIU! but may be eligible 
for other studies. If the participant is interested in other studies, the project coordinator will collect additional 
contact [CONTACT_738974]. All subjects will have to consent to being added to the 
IMPACT database.
(C.2.a.3) Recruitment  through street outreach.  University staff and interns will approach potential 
participants in various venues that cater to YMSM (e.g. bars, clubs, bathhouses, and festivals) and request the 
participant’s permission to tell him about the study. If the participant consents, university staff and interns will 
explain the purposes of the study and invite him to answer questions that screen for preliminary eligibility. If the 
participant is interested, he will answer questions privately on a tablet (or paper form if a tablet is not available).
Those deemed  eligible after completing the screener will be asked for their contact [CONTACT_3031], and will be 
contact[CONTACT_738976]. University staff will offer information about the 
study and options for confirming their HIV negative status. If a participant wants to visit a partner CBO testing 
site or university site (Emory and Hunter), university staff will schedule an appointment for HIV testing. If a 
participant wants to take an at-home HIV test, university staff will mail out a FDA approved at-home HIV test. 
After taking an at-home HIV test or testing at a partner CBO testing site or university site (Emory and Hunter), 
participants will follow the same consent procedure as described under “Recruitment through online, print, and 
telephone ads.” 
For those  who screen ineligible, the tablet will display ineligibility information and ask the participant if he would 
like to consent to enter his contact [CONTACT_738969]. When paper and pencil are

question in the contact [CONTACT_739027]. All 
subjects will have to consent to being added to the IMPACT database before research staff approaches them 
about participating in other studies. Information collected on the tablet through Assessment Center will be 
securely uploaded to the tracking system. Information collected with paper and pencil will be manually entered 
by [CONTACT_738963] 3 days of receipt.
(C.2.a.4) Recruitment  through community partner referrals.  Participants recruited through referrals from 
community partners that do not perform direct, full recruitment for KIU! will be given a business card with a pre-
generated screener code and a link an online screener after testing HIV negative. The screener codes on 
these business cards will only be valid for three months from the date that they are given to community 
partners. New batches of business cards with valid screener codes will be regularly distributed to partner sites. 
Once the screener code expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054], the participant will no longer be able to use it as verification that they have 
recently tested HIV negative. 
The participants  will use the link to access a study webpage for detailed project information and a brief 
eligibility screener. The participant is then asked if he is willing to complete the brief Eligibility Screener to 
determine if he is eligible to participate.  
If he  consents by [CONTACT_542590], his consent will be saved in a CSV file and later manually entered and saved 
into Assessment Center database as a data point. Once consent is given, the online Eligibility Screener form 
asks questions about demographics, including age, sex, sexual orientation, relationship status, and sexual 
behaviors. The participant will also be prompted to enter the screener code from the KIU! business card to 
verify that he has recently tested HIV negative. If the participant appears to be eligible, an automatic email  
with a study link will be triggered to be sent to the participant. After clicking this link, the participant will provide 
online consent before beginning the study.  Participants read through our online consent form and click either 
"I Agree" or "Decline". Their responses are collected and stored in the Assessment Center database.
For those  who screen ineligible, the online screener will ask the participant if he would like to consent to enter 
his contact [CONTACT_738969]. All subjects will have to consent to being added to 
the IMPACT database before research staff approaches them about participating in other studies. Information 
collected from the online screener will be exported to a CSV file and either the information will be uploaded to 
Assessment Center or manually entered by [CONTACT_738970] 3 days of receipt.
(C.2.a.5) Recruitment  through referrals from studies and research participant registries.  Participants 
who become interested in the study through referrals from past and ongoing studies or IRB approved research 
participant registries at the university sites will be directed to a study webpage for detailed project information 
and a brief eligibility screener. Interested participants will follow the same consent procedure as described 
under “(C.2.a.2) Recruitment through online, print, and telephone ads.”
(C.2.a.6) Recruitment  through CDPH clinics.
At the conclusion  of an HIV testing appointment, the CDPH staff member will give male clients who have 
tested HIV negative, and appear to be between the ages of 18 and 29, a brief description of the study. They 
will mention to the client that CDPH is working with Northwestern University researchers on the Keep It Up! 
study as a way to learn more about the health behaviors and outcomes of young men who have sex with men 
(YMSM). The CDPH staff member will briefly mention features of the study, such as it being a paid, online HIV 
prevention research study. To minimize the risk for coercion, the CDPH staff member will emphasize the 
optional nature of participation and that it will not affect, in any way, their access to healthcare services. The 
CDPH staff member will ask the client if he is interested in hearing more details about the study and possibly 
screening to see if he is eligible. If the client indicates that he is interested, the CDPH staff member will walk 
the client over to a Keep It Up! staff member who is stationed in another private room at the clinic. CDPH staff

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1010020] with  participants will be limited to the referral of participants to the study and will not include performing 
informed consent or enrolling participants into the study.
Prior to  administering the eligibility screener, Keep It Up! staff will request the client’s permission to tell him 
more about the study using a computer or tablet (or using pencil and paper, as necessary). The Keep It Up! 
staff member will give more details about the study (e.g. randomization, timeline, and study components). To 
minimize the risk for coercion, the staff member will reiterate the optional nature of participation and that it will 
not affect, in any way, their access to healthcare services at CDPH. If the client still appears interested, the 
Keep It Up! staff member will invite them to screen for the study. If the client consents to this, he will be given 
detailed information about the study on the computer or tablet (or paper form). The participant is then asked if 
he is willing to complete the brief online eligibility screener to determine if he is eligible to participate.
If he  consents by [CONTACT_542590] (or checking yes on the paper form), this consent will be documented as a data 
point in the Assessment Center database (if paper form used is used, the participant’s consent will be manually 
entered and saved into Assessment Center database as a data point). Once consent is given, the online 
eligibility screener form (or paper form) asks questions about demographics, including age, sex, sexual 
orientation, relationship status, and sexual behaviors.
If the  participant is eligible, he will be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_739028]. The Keep It Up! staff member will inform 
the participant of the opportunity to complete the baseline assessment and STI testing while on-site at the 
clinic. If the participant agrees, the Keep It Up! staff member will present him with a paper consent form that 
gives more information about the STI testing process on site. Participants who completed STI testing during 
their clinic visit will also be asked to consent to the clinic’s UIC lab sharing their STI results with study staff.  
After consenting to the on-site baseline and STI testing process, the participant will access the study using the 
link that we send via email. If the participant prefers to complete the baseline assessment and STI testing at 
home, before beginning the baseline assessment, he will be given an online consent form that outlines the at-
home STI testing process.
If the  participant is ineligible or not interested in taking part in Keep It Up, the computer (or paper form) asks if 
the participant is interested in other studies. If the participant would like to be contact[CONTACT_253970], the 
tablet (or paper form) prompts the participant to give his contact [CONTACT_3031]. All subjects will have to consent to 
being added to the IMPACT database before research staff approaches them about participating in other 
studies. When consent is collected on the tablet, it will be captured and documented in Assessment Center. 
When consent is collected on paper, it will be manually entered and saved into the Assessment Center 
database.
(C.2.a.7) Participants  who complete the baseline assessment and STI testing on-site at Emory 
University, Hunter College, or Northwestern University. Across all study sites, participants who have 
screened eligible will be offered the opportunity to visit Emory University, Hunter College, or Northwestern 
University to complete the baseline assessment and complete their first set of self-administered STI test kits. 
Upon arrival at the university site, participants will be given a paper consent form by [CONTACT_739029]! study staff that gives 
more information about the STI testing process on site.
(C.2.a.8) Participants  who complete an exit interview.  Prior to administering phone exit interviews, study 
staff will give participants a brief description of what the interview entails (e.g. reasons for interview, time 
commitment, and incentive). After providing this information, the study team will ask the participant to give 
verbal consent that they would like to take part in the interview and agree to be recorded. If the participant is 
not interested in taking part in the interview or being recorded, study staff will thank them for their time and end 
the phone call.

participant to give verbal consent that they would like to take part in the interview and agree to be recorded. If 
the participant is not interested in taking part in the interview or being recorded, study staff will thank them for 
their time and end the phone call. 
(C.2.a.10) Participants  who complete the Timed Post-Release Testing. After potential participants screen 
as eligible,  study staff  who contact [CONTACT_739030]! in greater detail. If they are still interested in 
participating in the timed post-release testing, a research assistant will email potential participants a link to an 
online consent form. Once the participant has consented, a research assistant will email them a unique link to 
the first intervention session. If a potential participant is not interested in completing the post-release testing, 
study staff will thank them for their time and end communication. 
C.2.b. Protection  Against Potential Coercion.  Any study that recruits participants from a healthcare setting 
has the potential for participants to feel coerced into participating. The investigators have extensive experience 
confronting the ethical issues of participant recruitment in clinical settings. We will work with all involved IRBs 
to assure compliance with ethical and HIPPA standards.  Specifically, , testing staff will not be given incentives 
for recruiting participants, and we will make it clear to participants that their decision regarding participation will 
not affect, in any way, their access to healthcare services. 
C.2.c. Protection  Against Discomfort. Multiple IRB-monitored studies at Northwestern University and our 
collaborating sites have used these or closely related measures with no known adverse effects.  Participants 
will be told that they do not have to answer any question they do not wish to.  Participants will be instructed 
that they can take a break and return to the online assessments or modules at a later time if they are 
experiencing mild distress. In the unlikely event that a participant experiences considerable distress they will 
be instructed to contact [CONTACT_739031], who will refer them as appropriate to either the PI (who is a 
Licensed Clinical Psychologist) or the local project coordinators who can assist in making appropriate local 
referrals. 
C.2.d. Protection  Against a Breach of Confidentiality. We will take several steps to prevent a breach of 
confidentiality. (1) We have developed systematic protocols for data handling and storage over longitudinal 
online studies.  Assessment Center has multiple mechanisms for providing data security in the transfer of data 
from client machines to Assessment Center servers.  These webservers use Secure Socket Layer (SSL or 
https) technology to encrypt data exchanged between the client and the server.  SSL will be implemented in all 
systems built for the project to ensure the encryption of data during transmission from the participants’ 
workstations to Assessment Center servers.  All project data will be stored on secured, password-protected 
database servers behind passcode-protected doors.  All components of the data system will be accessible only 
through a login and password unique to each assigned user on the study team.  The security access levels for 
these login accounts will be tiered based on specific roles and responsibilities for the project.  The features and 
privileges associated with each role and subsequent access level will be determined based on the level of 
access to confidential data needed by [CONTACT_438322].  For example, only project staff who maintain 
personal contact [CONTACT_739032].  Tracking staff will 
not be given access to survey data so they cannot link identifying information to participant data.  All other 
team members will only have access to data that are tied to a random ID number that cannot be used to 
personally identify the participant.  Database administrators in the Health Information Technology (HIT) group 
in the PI’s Department at Northwestern who manage the Assessment Center technology will only access the 
database with names and contact [CONTACT_739033]. 
Staying consistent with information provided to participants in the consent form, data sources will be purged 
two years after the end of the study in 2017. De-identified data will be stored indefinitely on secure shared 
drives housed on Northwestern’s servers.  (2) All study staff, including HIT staff, will be trained in Human 
Subjects research and will sign confidentiality agreements prior to participation in the project. (3) The HIT

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1010021] protocols for maintaining a secure 
environment for data submission from the clinic to the Assessment Center servers, including potentially 
implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection that will be used to enter identifying information, to 
provide an additional layer of encryption for that sensitive data. (4) We will employ the latest in encryption 
technology and server security (e.g. SSL encryption technology, firewalls, removing identifying information 
from servers accessible to the public) to minimize this possibility. (5)  All names and contact [CONTACT_739034]-up of participants will be stored in a database that is separate from the participant’s responses to the 
screener and the assessment.  Only a random study ID will be stored with the participant’s data for linkage to 
subsequent data later. (6) Participants recruited through ads and referrals will complete an online screener 
using Limesurvey. The LimeSurvey software is hosted on the kiu2.org domain on a virtual private server with 
an SSL encryption certificate. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_738923]. All data collected by [CONTACT_739035] a secure university shared drive. (7) As we have done in over five prior studies, we will 
obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality issued by [CONTACT_739036]. This protects the data from subpoena and thus prevents the data from 
being used against the participant. (8) We will inform study participants of the limits of the certificate of 
confidentiality during the consent process. (9) The majority of our messages to participants are automatically 
sent to participants through Assessment Center and other survey programs to reduce change of human error. 
Most messages not automatically sent are individualized messages sent to one participant at a time. Our 
protocol also instructs study staff to never send group emails without using blind carbon copying (bcc). We will 
use mail merge software for emails that need to go to more than one participant rather than sending group 
emails. Mail merge only sends one email to each participant. No participants will be carbon copi[INVESTIGATOR_738924]. If, for any reason, it is ever preferable to send a group email using bcc, the email will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_739037]. (10) When texting our participants, we will 
frequently use a service, Red Oxygen, that allows us to send texts from our secure Northwestern Outlook 
email accounts. Red Oxygen users can send messages to specific participants as well as bulk messages to 
lists of participants.  Red Oxygen’s Outlook add-on allows users to email individual text messages to 
participants and also receive and follow-up on responses through their Outlook account. Red Oxygen also 
offers standalone bulk texting software (Bulk SMS) that gives users the ability to email large text message 
blasts through their Outlook account. When bulk messages are sent, each recipi[INVESTIGATOR_738925]! phone number tied to our Red Oxygen account. They will not see the phone numbers 
of other participants. As with the individual messages, all responses to bulk messages are routed to KIU! staff’s 
Northwestern Outlook email account. Red Oxygen follows the National Privacy Principles as set out in the 
Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000. Red Oxygen is not allowed to 
use or sell any of the data from text messages that are sent through their systems. Text messages are 
considered phone calls and the use or sell of these messages would be considered wiretappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. More of Red 
Oxygen’s privacy policy can be reviewed at http://redoxygen.com/privacy-policy/. 
To help protect participants’  confidentiality while they complete the Internet-based assessments and 
intervention modules, we will: (1) remind participants each time they log on that they will be answering 
personal questions; (2) encourage them to complete the modules and questionnaires in a private environment; 
and (3) suggest spaces with greater privacy (e.g. in their dorm room with the door closed, at a coffee shop in 
an area where no one can look over their shoulder, etc). 
To help protect participants’  confidentiality while they complete the exit interviews as well as the repeat STI 
interviews, we will: (1) administer and record the interview in a private office space; (2) encourage participants 
to complete the interview in a private setting; (3) immediately transfer the recording of the interview from the 
digital recorder to a password protected folder on a secure university shared drive that only the study team can 
assess; (4) delete the interview from the digital recorder as soon as the audio file is uploaded to the secure 
university shared drive; and (5) save transcriptions of the audio recording to the secure university shared drive

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1010022]  also developed procedures with the STI testing laboratory at the CDC to prevent a breach of 
confidentiality:  (1) Participants will be given unique user IDs and passwords for all STI testing materials and 
for accessing STI test results.  (2) Electronic communications with the CDC lab will be conducted via secure 
emails.  This exporting de-identified STI test results to research study staff.  (3) At the CDC lab, all STI test 
results are stored on a secure, password-protected server and the results will only be provided to the research 
team with evidence of an IRB-approved research protocol. (4) For participants who collect the urine and rectal 
samples on-site at Emory University, Hunter College, or Northwestern University, samples that are not mailed 
out the same day will be stored in a locked storage cabinet by [CONTACT_739029]! study staff for no more than 7 days before 
being mailed to the CDC. The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay collection and transport tubes contain solution that 
protects the samples from degradation during storage. Urine samples can be stored for up to 30 days and 
rectal swabs can be stored for up to 60 days without refrigeration. Clinical specimens collected for this study 
will be tested for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Any remaining specimen material will be 
unlinked from patient identifiers and stored by [CONTACT_6750], up to 20 years, for possible future bacterial or viral 
research. Any future studies with these specimens will not involve analysis of human nucleic acid.
Participants who  are recruited from CDPH clinic sites and complete STI testing as a part of their clinic visit will 
be asked to authorize the clinic’s UIC lab sharing their STI results with the study team. Participants will be 
asked to read and sign a consent form that includes a section on HIPAA Authorization to Use or Disclose 
Health Information that describes which personal health information will be shared and how this health 
information will be shared. To help protect participants against a breach of confidentiality, all results will be 
shared via fax as the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows protected health information to be shared in this manner. KIU! 
staff will call the lab client services and provide the patient name, date of birth, and date of specimen collection 
in order to verify that correct results are sent. In addition, KIU! staff will verify the fax number to which the 
results should be sent. The fax machine to which results will be sent is located in the mail room of 
Northwestern’s Department of Medical Social Sciences (MSS). The MMS office is not open to the general 
public. The office is only accessible to staff with ID cards and invited guests who are buzzed into the office. 
Guests are typi[INVESTIGATOR_738912]. In general, only MSS staff access the fax machine.  
KIU! staff will ask the lab to confirm the time that the fax will be sent so that the results are immediately 
retrieved from the fax machine. All faxes of results will also include a fax cover sheet that describes the 
confidential nature of the contents and has instructions to notify the sender to report any faxes received in error 
and destroy the misdirected documents. The cover letter also warns that any mishandling of the documents, 
such as copying or dissemination, is illegal.
In order  to avoid data entry errors and sharing incorrect results with participants, the study team will do 
comprehensive checks on logged results and the PDFs of results sent to participants. First, in order to get a list 
of new STI results to be entered into REDCap and shared with participants, one of the two research assistants 
will apply filters to the running spreadsheet of results received from the CDC. Second, the Project Director and 
other research assistant will double check that the list is accurate. Once the list is confirmed as accurate, a 
research assistant will log them in REDCap and prepare PDFs of results to send to participants. Finally, the 
Project Director will check the results logged in REDCap as well as the PDFs before they are sent to 
participants. For individual results received from CDPH, the Project Director will compare the lab report to the 
results logged in REDCap and the PDF draft of results. In addition to this system of checks, the study Data 
Manager will perform quality assurance every two weeks on all STI data entered in REDCap.  
We have  also developed procedures with Home Access Health Corporation to prevent a breach of 
confidentiality:  (1) Participants will be given a unique [ADDRESS_1010023] results. (2) Electronic communications with Home Access will be 
conducted via SFTP.  HIV test results linked to unique 11 digit code number will be shared with research study 
staff through the SFTP. (3) At Home Access, all HIV test results are stored on a secure, password-protected 
server and the results will only be provided to the research team with evidence of an IRB-approved research 
protocol. (4) Blood specimens collected for this study will be tested for HIV-1. Any remaining specimen material 
will stored by [CONTACT_739038] 3 months before being disposed. The storage of blood samples for up to

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page [ADDRESS_1010024]  to STI testing and diagnosis:
All  participants will be tested for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia at baseline and post-intervention (12 month 
follow-up). Participants who test positive at baseline will be tested at 3 month and 6 month follow-up in 
addition to at the 12 month follow-up. 
For  participants who complete STI testing at a CDPH clinic, CDPH clinic staff will contact [CONTACT_739039]. For those who are positive for Chlamydia or Gonorrhea, CDPH clinic staff will 
report the results to the state or local health department. Clinic staff will also make sure that participants 
receive appropriate medical attention. 
Participants  who complete STI testing at home, at a university site, or at a CDPH clinic will be sent an 
encrypted email that they can only open using their unique study ID to receive their STI test results. 
Participants may speak to Keep It Up! study staff if they have any questions or concerns about their 
results. For those who are positive for Chlamydia or Gonorrhoeae, Keep It Up! study staff are required 
to report the results to state or local health department. Research study staff will follow up with the 
client to be sure they receive appropriate medical attention.  Research staff will: (1) encourage 
participants to notify current and past sex partners; (2) provide local referrals for free or low cost 
treatment; and (3) make a legally required confidential report to the appropriate health department. 
Health department professionals (or disease information specialists) may contact [CONTACT_739040]. The ability to link YMSM to needed clinical services is a distinct strength of this proposal as 
the multi-disciplinary investigative has considerable experience doing research with high-risk youth 
populations and the program of research is embedded in a larger network of CBOs designed to meet 
the needs of LGBT youth and YMSM.
C.3. POTENTIAL  BENEFITS OF THE STUDY TO SUBJECTS AND OTHERS
There are  several potential benefits to this study. YMSM may benefit by [CONTACT_739041], 
accessing HIV testing services, and decreasing their risk of HIV/STI infection as a result of program 
participation.  Collaborating CBOs may benefit from the collected evaluation data by [CONTACT_739042].  Society will benefit from the creation of an 
intervention that reduces risk behavior among YMSM, limiting the spread of HIV/AIDS, and addressing health 
disparities. Possible risks are outweighed by [CONTACT_739043]/STI-risk among YMSM. 
In addition  to these general study benefits, the exit interviews and the repeat STI interviews may provide 
information that can be used to refine future iterations of the intervention and better inform research efforts 
towards comprehensive at-home STI testing. As with the current intervention, these future iterations may 
benefit society by [CONTACT_739044].

Research Protocol  STU00073433, Version Date: 12/12/16; Page 40 of 50C.4. IMPORTANCE OF THE  KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED 
Rising HIV/AIDS  infection rates among YMSM and lack of existing evidence-based prevention programs 
warrant research to develop and test tailored HIV prevention programs. The purpose of this study is to 
systematically test an online, highly engaging and promising HIV prevention program tailored to YMSM. Such 
an intervention could play an important role in providing accessible prevention to YMSM, in particular YMSM 
seeking HIV testing. Currently, most testing clinics have limited time and resources to provide prevention. This 
approach represents an opportunity to develop a cost-effective and easy-to-use intervention that will engage 
participants and motivate and teach risk reduction behaviors.

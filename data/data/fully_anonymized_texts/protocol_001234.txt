 1 1. Comparison Details  
 
a. Intended aim(s)  
  
 To compare the risk of composite cancer outcomes , between patients treated with tofacitinib and patients treated with 
TNF inhibitors  (TNFi)  for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among, 1) “real world evidence (RWE) ” cohort s including routine care 
patient population from the US  and, 2) “Randomized controlled trial (RCT) DUPLICATE ” cohort s including routine care 
patient population who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria of the  Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis 
Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis  (“ORAL Surveillance ”, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) clinical trial.  
 
 To examine the risk of common solid cancers (lung, colorectal, breast, prostate), hematological cancers,  and non -
melanoma skin cancer as separated endpoints when comparing  tofacitinib with  TNFi  in patient s with RA among, 1) “real 
world evidence (RWE) ” cohort including routine care patient population from the US  and, 2) “Randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) DUPLICATE ” cohort including routine care patient population who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria of the  
Safety Study Of Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Ne crosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis  (“ORAL 
Surveillance ”, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) clinical trial.  
 
b. Primary endpoint  
 Composite all site cancer outcomes  excluding non -melanoma skin cancer  (NMSC) .

5. Cohort Identification  
 
a. Cohort Summary  
 
This study will employ a n active comparator,  new user  observational cohort study design comparing  initiators of  
tofacitinib to tumor necrosis  factor inhibitors ( infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, and 
golimumab) .[ADDRESS_1067614] continuo us enrollment  in their health plan  during the baseline period 
of 365 days before initiation of tofacitinib  or TNFi ( cohort entry date ). Follow -up begins the day after drug initiation .  
 
There will be two independent study population s: 
 
1) Real-World Evidence (RWE)  cohorts : This study population will reflect the patients  diagnosed with RA who are  
routinely treated  and managed  in setting of clinical practice . 
 
2) RCT-duplicate  cohorts : This study population will emulate  “the Safety Study Of  Tofacitinib Versus Tumor Necrosis 
Factor (TNF) Inhibitor In Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis ” clinical trial  (“ORAL Surveillance ”, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of this RCT will be applied to this study population.

 12 8. Study Follow -up Period:  
 
For the primary analysis, we will implement an as-treated  exposure definition. F ollow -up will start the day after initiation of 
tofacitinib and TNFi and will continue until the earliest date of the following events : 
 
 The first occurrence of the outcome of interest  
 The date of end of enrollment in the database  
 End of the study period  
 Date of treatment switch or drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_413594] a defined grace period (i.e., discontinuation defined after [ADDRESS_1067617] recent dispensing)  
 Death 
 
For seconda ry analysis, we will implement an intention -to-treat exposure definition. Follow -up will start the day after initiation 
of tofacitinib and TNFi and will continue until the earliest date  of the following events:  
 
 The first occurrence of the outcome of interest  
 The date of end of enrollment in the database  
 End of the study period  
 Death  
 365 days after the cohort entry  date

 13 9. Propensity score  fine stratification  analysis   
We will use a propensity -score (PS) -based approach to account for measured confounding in this study.[ADDRESS_1067618] (i.e., tofacitinib ) conditional on baseline covariates 
using multivariable logistic regression constructed separately in each data source.[ADDRESS_1067619] similar distribution of potential confounders used to estimate the PS. We will trim non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_777362].5 Subsequently, we will use PS fine stratification weighting to achieve covariate balance 
between treatment groups.6 We wi ll create 50 PS strata, based on the distribution of PS in tofacitinib -treated patients. A 
weight of one  will be assigned  to tofacitinib users and TNF inhibitor initiators will be weighted proportional to the distribution 
of tofacitinib initiators in the P S stratum into which they fel l to achieve covariate balance (Nexposed in PS stratum i/ Ntotal)/ (N reference 
in PS stratum i /Ntotal reference ).[ADDRESS_1067620] on the treated (ATT).[ADDRESS_1067621] deviation 
(SD), interquartile range (IQR), and range (minimum, maximum) for continuous variables, will be used to summarize 
baseline characteristics for each study cohort . Standardized differences will be used to compare ch aracteristics  before and  
after PS fine stratification  weighting .7,8 Crude incidence rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals  (CI) will be 
reported for each study outcome. The p rimary analysis will consist of  Cox proportional hazards mode l weighted using PS 
fine stratification weights and using an as-treated  exposure definition . This model  will generate weighted hazard ratio and 
95% confidence inter val when comparing tofacitinib with TNFi . We will also report difference in rates when compar ing 
tofacitinib with TNFi and corresponding 95% CI in the weighted population. Results will be reported independently for each 
database. Effect estimates w ill also be pooled across three databases using fixed effects model .  
 
We will also report cumulative  incidence and the corresponding 95% CI independently for all outcomes  and each study 
group  by [CONTACT_777365] . Secondary analysis will also be  conducted by [CONTACT_777366], which will 
be ascertained by [CONTACT_777367] a time -dependent man ner until end of follow -
up. We will compare  less than one year of cumulative use of tofacitinib with less than one year of use of TNFi and at least 
one year of cumulative use for tofacitinib with at le ast one -year of use of TNFi.  Pre-specified subgroup analysis will be

(1:1 matching).5,9 Standardized differences will be used to compare characteristics before and after matching. In addition, 
we will examine the risk of cancer  outcomes by [CONTACT_777368] (no 
previous prescriptions of bDMARDs vs ≥1 prescription of bDMARDs).  
 
Sensitivity analysis  will be conducted by [CONTACT_777369] a positive control outcome .[ADDRESS_1067623] of the treatments on cancer outcomes .

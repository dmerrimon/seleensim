1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Plaque psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic skin disease characterized b y raised, well -demarcated, 
oval ery thematous plaques covered in adherent silvery  scale ( R11-1257). Lesions are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y painful and/or itchy, and can be associated with a high degree of morbidity . PsO can 
affect extensive areas of skin; disease severit y is in fact defined b y bod y surface area (BSA) 
as mild (<3%), moderate ( 3-10%), and severe (>10%) ( P20-[ZIP_CODE] ). Approximately  25% of 
patients are classified as having moderate -to-severe disease. Disease severity  correlates 
inversel y with quality of life, as reported b y patients with regard to s ymptom severity and 
disease impact on functionality  and socialization ( R16-4115, R11 - 1260 , R03-1208 , R16-
3072 ). Plaques on visible skin (e.g., scalp, face, hands) have particular impact on phy sical, 
sexual, psy chosocial, and even economic status; dise ase severit y is associated with reduced 
levels of emplo yment and income ( R16-3072) . PsO is more than a superficial disease, with 
30% of patients having joint involvement, and a high correlation between PsO and obesity , 
diabetes, depression, metabolic sy ndrome, and cardiovascular risk ( R16-4115 ).
Affecting approximately  2% of the global population, including [ADDRESS_527138] prevalent immune- mediated skin disease ( R08-1089 ). 
Direct and indirect annual costs attributed to PsO in the US are estimated to be US $6,422 per 
patient on average, resulting in a total burden of US $35.[ADDRESS_527139] is distributed, 
roughl y in equal t hirds, to medical costs, reduced quality  of life, and productivity  loss ( R17-
1990 ). Across German y, Ital y, Spain, [LOCATION_006], and [LOCATION_009] the per -patient cost of PsO has been 
estimated to range from US $2,077 to $13,132 annually  (R17-1989 ).
The immunologic mechanism of PsO involves initial dendritic cell (DC) activation by  
[CONTACT_417811], leading to IL- [ADDRESS_527140] chemotaxis and inflammation, and of defensin and S100A family  peptides which alter 
expression of multiple genes involved in cell adhesion. The critical role of IL- 17 in PsO 
pathogenesis has been extensively  evaluated in IL -17-knockout animal models and confirmed 
in humans. T h17 cells, the majority  of which are of memory  phenot ype, are enriched in the 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_417785]. Disease severity  has been shown to correlate directl y 
with IL -17A level ( R16-
3073). The central role of IL- 23 and IL-17 activity  in the 
pathogenesis of disease has been proven unequivocally  by [CONTACT_417812] c linical efficacy  of 
biologic agents targeting these cy tokines in the treatment of patients with moderate- to-severe 
plaque PsO. 
Mainstay s of therap y for the treatment of PsO include topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450], ultraviolet light -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], traditional s ystemic agents ( e.g., methotrexate, acitretin, cy closporine), and more 
recentl y, targeted biologic and small- molecule therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Steroidal and non -steroidal topi[INVESTIGATOR_113899] (e.g., vitamin D analogues, retinoids, tar, anthralin, salicy lic acid, tacrolimus) are 
efficacious, particularl y for mild- to-moderate disease, but ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_417786] -term 
administration, and often provide only  incomplete clearance. Long -term adherence to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -prescribed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_417787], and sy stemic absorption limits long -term usage

lesions. Ultraviolet light -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], often combined with the photosensitizing agent 
psoralen, may  be used to treat extensive areas of involved skin, but generally require long-
term therap y, and are associated with non -melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Conventional 
systemic agents provide relatively  inexpensive options to treat more severe or refractory  
disease, but long -term usage may  be substantiall y limited b y the risks of hepatotoxicity , bone 
marrow suppression, and pulmonary  toxicity  (methotrexate), teratogenicity (acetretin), and 
nephrotoxicity  and hy pertension (cy closporine). During the past 15 y ears, antibodies 
targeting TNFα, and subsequently  IL-12/[ADDRESS_527142] demonstrated substantial 
efficacy  and indeed complete remission rates, with safet y and tolerability superior to 
conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Retinoic acid -related orphan receptor (ROR) γt is a nuclear hormone receptor/transcription 
factor expressed in T h17 cells and in distinct subsets of ly mphoid cells, including NK cells, 
innate ly mphoid cells (ILC), and 
T-cells. RORγt sits at a key  focal point, integrating 
multiple signals, including T cell receptor engagement and cy tokines (e.g., IL -1, IL -6, IL -23), 
and driving the expression of multiple genes (e.g., IL
-17A, IL -17F, IL-22, IL -23R). Via 
sitting at this focal node integrating multiple signals and effecting multiple outputs, RORγt 
has the potential to have a broader effect in Th17- mediated dise ased than individual cy tokine 
blockades alone (e.g., IL -23 or IL -17).

or Phase II trials are currently  ongoing , including this trial. The Investigator’s Brochure 
(c09228382
) provides the most current and complete detail of BI [ADDRESS_527146] -in-human trial 1407 .1evalua ted single - rising dose administration of BI 
730357 ranging from 2 mg through 800 mg, given as oral solution (2 mg and 8 mg) and film -
coated tablets (25 mg to 800 mg) to healthy  male adult subjects aged 18 to 45 y ears. 
Approximately  84 subjects were to be e ntered into the trial; each group of 8 subjects was 
randomized (6 active:2 placebo) into sequential dose groups under fasting (2 mg, 8 mg, 25 
mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg), and fed conditions (400 mg, 800 mg). An 
additional [ADDRESS_527147] crossover substudy , and administered 25 
mg BI 730357 as oral solution, tablet fasting, and tablet fed. In total, 66 male adult subjects 
received BI 730357.
Safety  evaluations included phy sical examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory  tests, and 
adverse events (AEs). AEs, which generally  reflected commonly -occuring events of short 
duration, and were mostly mild or moderate in severity , were distributed without discernable 
trend among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_417789] 730357. No serious AEs 
(SAEs) were reported. Overall, single -dose administration of 
BI [ADDRESS_527148] administration of BI 730357 ranging from 25 mg 
to 400 mg, given as film-coated tablets to healthy  male adult subjects aged 18 to 45 years. 
Approximately  84 subjects were to be entered into the trial; each group of 12 subjects was 
randomized (9 active:3 placebo) into one of 4 sequential dose groups under fasting co nditions 
(25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg), and 3 sequential dose groups under fed conditions (50 mg, 
200 mg, and 400 mg). Subjects were dosed for 14 days (dose groups up to 100 mg) or 28 
days (200 mg and 400 mg dose groups).
Safety  evaluations included phy sical examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory  tests, and 
AEs. 
Nodeaths, S AEs, or severe AEs were reported during the trial. Overall, administration 
ofBI [ADDRESS_527149] exposures observed in this study  were substantially  below the NOAEL exposures 
observed in the 4- week dog stud y.
In fasted individuals, exposure (Cmaxand AUC) increased in a less than dose -proportional 
manner over the entire dosing range, both for single and multiple dosing. Steady  state was 
attained b y 7 da ys of multiple dosing, with an accumulation of approximately  2-fold for both 
Cmaxand AUC. 
Under fed conditions, BI 730357 plasma exposures (AUC and C max) were 
observed to be higher compared with the same dose level under fasted conditions.

The aim of this Phase II t rial is to investigate safety , tolerability , and efficacy  of B I730357 in 
patients with moderate -to-severe plaque PsO. Favorable results of this trial will serve as a 
PoCC in the treatment of PsO, for refinement of Phase III dose selection, and to support 
further development in other disease indications.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_527157]-03(14.0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016Rationale for performing Part 2: 
Modelling of data from Part [ADDRESS_527158] been reached with 200 mg dosed q.d. under fasted conditions, and that
exposures resulting from posologies dosing BI 730357 higher, under fed conditions, and/or 
twice dail y may provide better efficacy .
Part 2 of this trial therefore plans to evaluate the 
efficacy , safet y, tolerability , and PK of 400 mg q.d.and 200 mg b.i.d. administration of BI 
730357, under fed conditions, to patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO .
It is anticipated that higher 
median BI 730357 exposures, as expected with 400 mg dosed 
q.d., and 200 mg dosed b.i.d. under fed conditions for 12 weeks will not exceed the NOAEL 
thresholds observed in 13 week general toxicity  studies (see section 1.2.1 ). Treatment with 
doses of up to [ADDRESS_527159] trial 1407 -0002, and with doses of up to 200 mg q.d.under fasting conditions 
for more than 12 weeks thus far i n Part 1 of this trial did not identify  any safety signals (see 
section 1.2.2 ).
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Study  participants are exposed to the risks of the study  procedures and the risks related to the 
exposure to the trial medication.
Procedure -
related risks
Blood sampling b y venipuncture or through an indwelling venous catheter may be 
accompanied by  [CONTACT_151807], in rare cases, by  [CONTACT_417815]. In addition, in rare cases a nerve might be injured while inserting the venous 
catheter, potentially  resulting in paresthesia, reduced sensibility , and/or pain for an indefinite 
period. 
The total volume of blood withdrawn per subject during the trial will amount to 
approximately  350 mL (over 24 weeks in Part 1) and 250 mL (over 12 weeks in Part 2) . In 
the optional intensive PKsubstudy , approxamitely  an additional 60 mL willbe withdrawn. 
No health
-related risk is expected from this blood withdrawal.
Drug -related risks and safety  measures
As the nature of the target and the mechanism of action of BI 730357 are well understood, 
comparable compounds hav e been tested b y other companies before, and the animal models

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_527160]-03(14.0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016are believed to be predictive for the effects in humans, BI 730357 is not seen as a high risk 
compound.
The pharmacological effects of BI 730357 are dose dependent, and no evidence for prolong ed 
or irreversible effects has been observed. Multiple dose administration of up to 200 mg 
BI730357 q.d. fasted (over 24 weeks in Part 1) and of up to 400 mg q.d. fed(over 12 weeks 
in Part 2) is supported by [CONTACT_094] -clinical, as well as clinical safet y data from trial 1407 .1and 
trial 1407-0002 (see section 1.2.2 ). 
Since preclinical data indicate that BI 730357 has phototoxicity  potential, subjects in this trial 
will be advised to apply  protection measures as described in section [IP_ADDRESS]. Solarium 
radiation , treatment with ultraviolet light (e.g., PUVA) , and use of medication with known 
phototoxicity  potential (e.g., doxy cycline) areprohibited during this clinical trial until the end 
of the follow- up period.
BI 730357 is confirmed as a sensitive cy tochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrate, based on 
clinical drug -drug interaction (DDI) evaluation with itraconazole, a CYP3A inhibitor, in trial 
1407- 0014. Drugs or foods that are known CYP3A inhibitors or str ong or moderate CYP3A 
inducers should not be co -administered in clinical trials with BI 730357. Based on in vitro 
data, BI 730357 could potentially  induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, or 2C19 in human. 
Sensitive substrates of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, or 2C19 f or which a reduction in exposure 
could present a potential patient risk should not be given together with BI 730357. 
Additionally , based on 
in vitro data, BI 730357 may  inhibit a number of transporters in 
human; based on the magnitudes of the in vitro inhi bition, it is recommended that substrates 
of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2- K for which an 
increase in exposure could present a potential patient risk should not be given together with 
BI 730357.
As with other immune -targeted t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], impaired host defense is a theoretical target -related 
toxicity , potentially  resulting in increased risk of infection and/or malignancy . Th17 cells 
play an important role in defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi at mucosal surfaces 
(R16-
3166), ( R16- 3149). I n some studies, IL - 17-antagonists were associated with increased 
infections ( R13-2643). Homozy gous, but not heterozy gous RORC knockout mice have a high
incidence of T cell l ymphoma, thought to originate in the thy mus ( R16-2630 ). While the 
translatability  of the knockout phenoty pe to pharmacological RORγ antagonism and to 
humans is unknown, this raises the h ypothetical concern for clinical T cell ly mphoma risk. 
The exact cause of T -cell ly mphomas in RORC knockout mice is not fully understood, but 
changes in homeostasis in the thy mus, such as th ymocyte apoptosis and proliferation, are 
thought to play  a role. No evidence of an in creased risk of ly mphoma development or 
changes preceding l ymphoma development has arisen based on the BI 730357 toxicology  
studies in rat and dog ofup to 26- and 39- week duration, respectively . AEs and SAEs 
consistent with malignancy, and specificall y those representing l ymphoma, are to be 
evaluated throughout the BI 730357 clinical development program. Thus far, no clinical 
signal regarding malignancy  has been identified in BI 730357 clinical trials.
As with all drugs, the potential for h ypersensitivity and allergic reactions has to be taken into 
consideration when BI 730357 is administered.

by [CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this trial requires timely  detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations in selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients´ 
safet y, see also section 5.2.[ADDRESS_527162] (AESI) to ensure timel y
characterization, monitoring, and reporting of an y such effects in this study  (see section s 
1.2.1 and5.2.6.1 ).
Results of the Week 12 primary  anal ysis from Part 1 of this trial demonstrate proof- of-
concept in the treatment of patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO for BI 730357 at the 
200 mg dose. Patients with plaque 
PsO receiving BI 730357 may  therefore experience 
improvement in disease severit y. C
onsidering the data and modelling from thePart 1 Week 
12 primary  anal ysisof this trial, higher efficacy may be observed in Part 2 of this trial with 
the expected higher BI 730357 exposure sresulting from dosing posologies to be evaluated .
However, this is a newl y - developed drug at an early  stage of testing, therefore an individual 
benefit for patients cannot be guaranteed. In addition, patients may  be randomized to placebo 
treatment and not see an y potential benefit. Nonetheless, the results from toxicit y and safet y 
pharmacology  studies demonstrated an acceptable profile for clinical trials with daily  oral 
administration. The potential risks which are described above will be minimized by  [CONTACT_417816] a n independent external DMC. These risks are considered 
manageable and outweighed by  [CONTACT_417817].

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a Phase II trial consisting of tw o parts.
Part 1:
Part 1 is a randomised, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, double- blind evaluation of 
approximately  180 male and female patients with moderate- to-severe plaque PsO.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_527173]-03(14.0) / Saved on: 17 October [ZIP_CODE].2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
A randomised, double blind, placebo -controlled, parallel design has been chosen in order to 
evaluate safet y, efficacy , PK, and PD of BI730357 in patients with moderate -to-severe 
plaque PsO. A placebo control arm has been chosen to be included in order to evaluate the 
absolute effects of BI730357 on safet y and tolerability . This is acceptable ,as the duration of 
the placebo treatment, if no spontaneous improvement of the disease occurs, will be limited 
to 12 weeks, and no intolerable disease progression is to be expected during this period.
Patients completing the treatment priod of the trial will be offered to roll over into an 
extension trial , in which they will continue receiv ing study  medication . 
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
The trial is intended to provide PoCC of BI 730357 in the treatment of moderate -to-severe 
plaque PsO. Therefore, in Part 1 approximately  180 male and female patients suffering from 
this condition will be included at about 3 2study  sites .In Part 2, approxi mately  90 male and 
female patients will be included.
Screening of patient s will be competitive, i.e. ,screening will stop at all sites once a sufficient 
number of patient s havebeen screened. Investigators will be notified about screening 
completion , and will then not be allowed to screen additional patient s for this trial.
A log of all patient s enrolled into the trial(i.e.,who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the ISF at the investigational site ,irrespective of whether they  have been 
treated with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is randomised in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria on the day  of enrolment), the sponsor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] i mmediately .

pertaining to the in clusion and exclusion criteria.
3.3.4 Withdrawal of patient s from t reatment or assessments
Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withraw consent to trial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very  different implications, please see sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 
[IP_ADDRESS] below. Every  effort should b e made to keep the randomis ed patients in the trial :if 
possible ontreatment , or at least to collect important trialdata. Measures to control the 
withdrawal rate include c areful patient selection, appropriate explanation of the trial 
requirements and procedures prior to randomization, as well as theexplanation of the 
consequences of withdrawal. The decision to withdraw from trial treatment or from the whole 
trial, as well as the reason, must be documented in the patient files and CRF. If the reason fo r 
discontinuation is death, this should be reported on the SAE form as well, regardless of 
causal relationship.
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of trial treatment
An individual patient may be withdrawn from trialtreatment if:
The patient wants to discontinue trialtreatment , without the need to justify  the decision.
The patient has repeatedly shown to be non -compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15566], the investigator and sponsor representative, is not willing or 
able to stick to the trial requirements in the future.
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational product 
as listed in Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1 .
The patient can no longer be treated with trialmedication for other medical reasons ( such 
assurgery , adverse events, other diseases, or pregnancy ).
The patient develops suicidal ideation of ty pe 4 or 5 in the C -SSRS (i.e. active suicidal 
thought with intent but without specific plan, or active suicidal thought with plan and 
intent) .The patient should immediately  be refered t o a mental health professional for 
further work -up.
In addition to these criteria, the phy sician may  discontinue subjects at any  time based on 
his or her clinical judgment.
In case of a temporary  reason, trial treatment should be restarted as earl y as possible if 
medically  justified. Even if the trial treatment is permanentl y discontinued, the patient 
remains in the trial and, given his/her agreement, will undergo the procedu res for earl y 
treatment discontinuation and follow up as outlined in the FLOW CHART, Part 1 and FLOW 
CHART, Part 2 and section 6.2.3 .For all patient s,the reason for withdrawal from trial 
treatment (e.g., AE) must be recorded in the CRF . These data will be included in the trial
database and reported.
[IP_ADDRESS] W ithdrawal of consent for trial participation
Patients may  withdraw their consent for trial participation at any  time ,without the need to 
justify  the decision. If a patient wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should explain 
the difference between treatment withdrawal and w ithdrawal of consent for trial participation,

preclinical efficacy  data.
The proposed BI 730357 dose selection strate gy for P oCC evaluation in PsO patients was 
predicated upon the estimated whole blood BI 730357 IL -17 IC 50concentration in murine 
models, from which an anticipated human therapeutic trough exposure of 140 nM at stead y 
state (C min,ss) was predicted (with a corresponding AUC 0-24,ssof 5200 nM•h ). The target C min,ss
in human was determined based on the effective plasma concentration required to reduce the 
tissue level of IL -17 by  80% in an IL -[ADDRESS_527186] mouse model [c09228382 ].
Part 2: 
Modelling of dat a from Part [ADDRESS_527187] been reache d with 200 mg dosed q.d.under fasted conditions, and that 
exposures resulting from posologies dosing BI 730357 higher, under fed conditions, and/or 
twice dail y ma y provide a better efficacy. Doses of 200 mg b.i.d. and 400 mgq.d.
administered under fed conditions aretherefore selected for Part 2 of this trial (see section 
1.3). The higher BI [ADDRESS_527188] to the 
NOAEL levels observed in 13 week general toxicity  studies (see section 1.2.1 ). In addition ,
treatment of patients with BI [ADDRESS_527189] 
trial 1407-0002 did not identify  any safety  signals (see section 1.2.2 ). 
In summary , the data generated in Part 2 of this trial will extend characterization of the dose-
response relationship within a wider therapeutic range, and enable selection of the dose range 
for Phase III development.
4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups

5.2.5 Other safety parameters
[IP_ADDRESS] Suicidality
Suicidal thoughts and behavior will be assessed by [CONTACT_48649]- Suicide Severity  Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS , R08- 1147 ). 
The C -SSRS is a semi -structured, inv estigator- rated interview, developed by  [CONTACT_342349], assessing both suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. I t does 
not give a global score, but provides some categorical and some severity  information 
specificall y for beha vior and ideation.
The C -SSRS interview may  be administered by  [CONTACT_342350], psy chologist, clinical 
social worker, mental health counselor, nurse, or coordinator with C -SSRS training. It has a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_417801], and causes onl y a low burden on subjects. At a minimum, 
the interview consists of 2 screening questions related to suicidal ideation and 4 related to 
suicidal behavior, and may  be expanded to up to 17 items in case of positive responses. Free 
text entries are allowed for; t he investigator has to directly  evaluate the scale and write a 
report. In this trial , paper forms will be used for the assessment of the C- SSRS® ,and results 
will be transcribed into the e-CRF.
The C -SSRS has been widely  used in large multinational clinical trials. The C -SSRS will be 
administered at the Screening Visit/Visit 1 (using the ‘baseline/ screening’ version) with the 
aim to exclude patients with active moderate or severe s ymptomatology  within a specified 
time prior to the screening or screening visit. The lifetime and the past year history  of suicidal 
ideation and behavior will also be recorded.
After the screening visit, the assessment ‘since last visit’ version will be performed at ea ch 
visit. The investigator is to review positive and negative reports for plausibility  and clinical 
relevance. Doubtful reports may  be repeated or reports may be validated by a consulting 
psychiatrist or other mental health professional expert . If there is a confirmed positive report 
of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 after start of trial, the investigator is to 
immediately  interview the patient, and/or is to consult a mental health professional . If the 
positive report is confirmed, appro priate actions for the patient’s safet y have to be initiated.
All C -SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type [ADDRESS_527220] 
be reported as separate SAEs by  [CONTACT_093].
For ‘Self -injurious behavior, without suicidal i ntent’, standard AE / SAE reporting rules are 
to be applied.

[IP_ADDRESS] M ajor Adverse Cardovascular Event (M ACE)
An independent adjudication committee will be used to adjudicate all observed cardio -and 
cerebro -vascular and thrombotic events reported during the conduct of the study ,to assure 
consistent assessment of m ajor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). See section 8.7 .
5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An AEis defined as any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in t he CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination ,and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093].
Ifsuch abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion, they  will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death i f more severe.
-requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23235] 
-requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15537],
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,or
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions. Examples of such events are in tensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88796].

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_527222]-03(14.0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016AEs considered “Always Serious”
Cancers of new histology and exacerb ations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in section [IP_ADDRESS] , subsection s “AE Collection” and“AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines” .
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
BIhas set up a list of further AEs, which b y their nature, can alway s be considered to be 
“serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system . A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described above .
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g.,the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. 
AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE s, please see above .
The following are considered as A ESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_15624]: 
an elevation of AST and/or ALT >[ADDRESS_527223] combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin >[ADDRESS_527224] measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥[ADDRESS_527225]
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the patient s showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (e.g., icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain) without lab results ( e.g., 
ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these param eters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .

Gastric intolerance and gastritis:
Even though gastritis development is not expected in humans, AE consistent with gastric
intoleran ce or gastritis are designated as AE of special interest (AESI), to ensure timely
characterization, monitoring and reporting of an y such events in this study (for details, please 
refer to section 1.2.1 ).
Not all gastrointestinal events will be considered AESI . Onl y events that are consistent with
the following definitions are considered AESI and will need to be reported accordingl y:
Any AEof “nausea” or “vomiting” of moderate or worse severit y(according to RCTC, 
OR of prolonged duration   (≥7 day s), OR
Any AEof“gastritis” (regardless of duration or severity )
Intensity (severity) of AEs

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_527229]-03(14.0) / Saved on: 17 October 2016A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. ,Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. ,greater effect size if the dose is increased, 
smaller effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g.,pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of c ancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g., after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. ,
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchang ed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting
AE Collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF(s) by  [CONTACT_1275]:
•From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual patient ’send of trial: 
all AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs .
•After the individual patient ’s end of trial: 
the investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for AEs but should only  
report related SAEs and related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware 
ofby [CONTACT_23321], e.g. phone call. Those AEs should however, not 
be reported in the eCRF .
Patients who discontinue trial medication prematurely  and agree to be contact[CONTACT_23322], 
should be followed up as described in section [IP_ADDRESS] , “withdrawal from trial treatment”. 
From then on until the individual patient’s end of the trial ,the investigator must report all 
deaths/fatal AEs regardless of relationship, related SAEs, and related AESIs of which the

reported SAE or AESI on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) t o the 
sponsor’s unique entry  point (country  specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF). 
The same timeline applies if follow -up information becomes available. In specific occasions ,
the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y furthe r information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
eCRF pages and the BI SAE form , if applicable . The investigator should determine the causal 
relationship to the trial medication and an y possible interactions between the trial medication 
and a Non -Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP) / Auxiliary  Medicinal Product (AMP).
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the CRF andBI SAE form (if 
applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination ,and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093] .
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline

after individual patient ’s end of trialmust be followed up until they  have resolved, have been 
assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further information can be obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occu r in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the

during pregnancy  in a trialparticipant immediately  (within 24 hours) by  [CONTACT_15627] A of 
the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry  point.
Similarly , potential drug exposure during pregnancy  must be reported if a partner ofa male 
trialparticipant becomes pregnant. This requires a written consent of the pregnant partner. 
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the s ponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trial s (Part B).
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trial s (Part A and B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
Part 1:
The primary  trial objective includes demonstration of PoCC with respect to a non -flat dose 
response curve, characterization of the dose-response relationship within the therapeutic 
range, and selection of the dose range for phase III development. See section 2.1.1 for details 
on the objective of this trial . For this purpose, the primary  anal ysis uses methodology  for 
dose finding employ ing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques 
(MCPMod). The co -primary  endpoin ts are defined in section 2.1.2 .
Part 2:
ABayesian borrowing approach will be implemented to estimate treatment effect by  [CONTACT_47736] 75 
and sPGA. No hypothesis testing will be performed . The primary  endpoint is defined in 
section 2.1.2
Baseline refers to the measurement recorded at randomisation (Visit 2); if data at Visit 2 is 
missing, then data from Visit 1 will be considered baseline. The percent reduction from 
baseline is calculated b y % PASI  reduction from baseline = ((PASI  at baseline -PASI  at Visit 
X) / PASI  at baseline) * 100, at all follow up visits. Achieving an x% or larger reduction from 
baseline PASI  score is denoted as PASI  X.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
Part 1:
The co -primary  endpoints are based on Week 12 PASI  75 and sPGA 0/[ADDRESS_527249] protecting the overall probability  of Ty pe I error (one sided α of 
5%). The pre -specified models and their parameters used for this test are outlined in section 
7.3.1 .
Part 2:
The co -primary  endpoints are based on Week 12 PASI 75 response and sPGA 0/1. PASI  75 
at week 12 will be anal ysed based on a Bay esian borrowing approach.

the Fu ll Anal ysis Set (FAS).
Safety  anal yses will be based on the actual treatment received; this set of patients is 
called the Treated Set (TS).
Specifications of important protocol v iolation s will be provided in the TSAP.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
Part 1:
The achievement of PASI [ADDRESS_527251] patient reaches Week 12, the anal yses for PoCC and dose -finding will be 
performed on each co -primary  endpoint using multiple comparison and modelling t echniques 
(MCPMod) [ R10-1424 , R15-1961 ] for binary  data whereby  [CONTACT_417825] (patterns) will be evaluated, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_342336] I error at 5%, one -
sided , to identify  the best -fitting model or subset of models.
A non -flat dose -response relationship is established if for each co -primary  endpoint, the null 
hypothesis of no dose effect (i.e., a flat dose response curve) is rejected for at least one of the 
pre-specified models with respect to the alpha chosen.
For the sample size calculation, the maximum effect size is assumed to be 50%, with the
placebo effect size assumed to be 10% for PASI [ADDRESS_527252] size is 
assumed to be 50% with the placebo effect size assumed to be 10% for sPGA (0/1) at Week

response patterns (Figure 7.3.1:1 ) based on current expectation. Assuming the following dose 
groups will be tested: placebo, active BI 730357 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg.
 Linear: no assumptions needed
 Emax 1: 30% of the maximum effect is achi eved at 50 mg
 Emax 2: 80% of the maximum effect is achieved at 50 mg
 Exponential: 5% of the maximum effect is achieved at 25 mg
 Logistic: 10% of the maximum effect is achieved at 25 mg
      80% of the maximum effect is achieved at [ADDRESS_527254] are applied on

error rate at one sided α = 5%. 
If PoCC is established, the statistically  significant (best fitting) model(s) from the above 
candidate set are refitted to the data to generate new estimates for all model parameters from 
the data. The final model will be obtained via model averaging across the significant models 
based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The target dose(s) can be estimated from that

extrapolation.
If considered necessary  and for the purpose of further model refinement, MCPMod might be
repeated on the primary  endpoint but with an extended set of shapes including the original 
candidates.
Comparisons between treatment groups will be exploratory  in nature. Comparisons between 
treatment groups regarding the co -primary  endpoints will also be performed using the Chi -
square test for each of the four active treatments versus placebo. In addition, unadjusted

display ed. This is considered the secondary  anal ysis for the primary endpoint(s). More details 
on the above anal yses as well as additional sensitivity  anal yses will be given in the TSAP.
For the PoCC anal ysis, the anal yses will be p erformed by  [CONTACT_417827]. A logistics plan 
prepared and approved in accordance with Sponsor’s specific procedures will detail 
procedures used to ensure that all members of the trial team remain blinded. The logistics 
plan will also contain a detailed list of functions that need to be unblinded to perform this 
analysis.
Part 2:
The achievement of PASI 75 at Week 12 will be summarized in the form of proportion of 
patients achieving PASI 75 at Week 12 as an outcome measure so as to perform the primary  
analysis. 
The primary  anal ysis on PASI  75 at week 12 will be based on a Bay esian borrowing 
approach. For the placebo control group, an informative prior is based on his torical data 
whereas the prior for the BI 730357 group is non -informative. The derivation of the 
informative prior is based on a meta -analytic predictive (MAP) prior approach which is 
additionally  robustified against prior -data conflicts by[CONTACT_1583] a vaguel y informative 
component to the prior.
A Bay esian approach with an informative mixture beta prior for the placebo group will be 
used. The prior is a combination of a mixture of informative beta priors derived from 
historical trials and a vaguely  informativ e beta prior .Theweight on the vaguel y informative 
beta prior is 50%. The prior considered is : 0.388 * Beta (8.269, 132.315 ) + 0.112 * Beta 
(2.546, 27.521 ) + 0.5 * Beta (0. 07, 0.93 ). Non -informative beta prior Beta( 1, 1) is used for BI 
active treatment arms. The actual prior may  be updated based on additional historical 
information being available , including result from part I . The final prior will be documented 
in the TSAP.
The primary  anal ysis for sPGA clear or almost clear at week 12 will be analy sed by 
[CONTACT_417828] t he proportion of responders in each arm with 95% exact confidence intervals.
If considered necessary ,same approach as PASI [ADDRESS_527258] of BI 730357: (1) significance: a posterior probability  of at least 90% that 
the PASI  75 response rate for patients on BI 730357 is higher than that for patients on 
placebo; and (2) relevance: a posterior proba bility  of at least 50% that the PASI  [ADDRESS_527259] one dose satisfy  both criteria, it is considered as “pass”. If neither doses 
have significan ce or relevance criteria been met, it is considered as “not pass”. Otherwise it is 
in the “consider” zone, where sPGA 0/1 at week 12 will be jointly  evaluated.

If considered necessary , aMCPMod approach will also be applied to selected secondary
endpoints.
The same methods as discussed for the secondary  anal ysis for the primary  endpoint s will be 
used to anal yse clinical binary  secondary  endpoints, if applicable.
For binary  endpoints aft er Week 12, two anal ysis strategies will be considered as following:

Non-responders at Week 12 will be imputed as failure for binary  endpoints after 
Week 12.
For non -responders at Week 12, analy sis based on the escalated treatment they  
received at Week 12 will also be considered.
For PSS total score at Week 12, po int estimates and two -sided 95% confidence intervals for 
mean reduction from baseline and difference between each BI 730357 arm and placebo will

dose of trialmedication ,willbe assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patient s will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of AEs will concentrate on treatment- emergent AEs, i.e.,all 
adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period . AEs 
that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as 
‘treatment -emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_417829] (MedDRA) at the database lock .
Laboratory  data will be analy sedboth quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be summarised . Treatment 
groups wil l be compared descriptivel y with regard to distribution parameters as well as with 
regard to frequency  and percentage of patient s with abnormal values or clinically  relevant 
abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening,

Part 1:
When the last patient completes the [ADDRESS_527264] patient completes the Week 12 visit (timepoint of primary  endpoint), the 
primary  anal ysis will be performed. In order to support the further double- blinded conduct of 
the trial until the Week 24 visit, the Trial Team will be kept blinded on the individual patients’ 
treatment group a ssignment. A separate team will be formed to perform this analy sis. Details 
will be specified in the logistic plan.

The following rules will be used to impute for missing data:
-For all non -binary  endpoints, L OCF (Last Observation C arried Forward) will be used to 
impute missing values 
-For all binary  endpoints (i.e., endpoints that are either 1 (patient responded) or 0 (patient did 
not respond)):
-If no data after that visit*, then impute as failure (NRI [No Response I mputation])

else impute as failure.
* Patients that take prohibited medications to treat PsO will be treated the same as those that 
discontinued from the trial, i.e., subsequent visits following start of prohibited medication 
will be considered as failure for binary  endpoints. 
Missing items from the Quality  of Life questionnaires will be handled according to the 
measure i nstructions (cf. Appendix 10. 6). If there is no data for a particular visit, then it will 
be imputed following the same rules as described above.
More details will be i ncluded in the TSAP, if needed .
7.6 RANDOMISATION
An IRT will be used for the assignment of subjects to treatment groups. 
Part1:
Patients will be randomised in blocks to double-blind treatment. Patients will be randomised 
to one of 4 BI 730357 dose groups and placebo in a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio. I n total, approximately  40 
patients will be allocated to each BI 730357 active dose group, and approximately  20 patients 
to placebo. Refer to section 3.1 for the details .
Part 2:
Patients will be randomised to the 200 mg b.i.d. , 400 mg q.d.BI 730 357 dose group or 
placebo in a 4 :4:[ADDRESS_527268] will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo -
random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non -
predictable. The block size will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report. Access to the 
codes will be controlled and documented.
7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
Part 1:
Sample size calculation is mainly  driven b y safet y considerations.
Based on an assumed m aximum treatment effect size of BI 730357 vs. placebo for the PASI 
75 endpoint, as well as on the pre- specified models listed in section 7.3.1 , the power is 
provided in the Table 7.7 : 1for different scenarios for one of the co -primary  endpoint PASI 
75. The maximum treatment benefit is assumed to be 50% compared to placebo ( 60% vs 
10%) for PASI 75 at Week 12.

Assumptions considered:
A: Main scenario reflecting assumption listed in section 7.3.1 . Assuming PASI  75 
response rate is 10% (placebo), 60% for the 200 mg dose group. Sample size 
considered is 180 patients with 2:2:2:2:1 allocation ratio. 
B: Similar scenario as A, but response rate at 200 mg dose grou p is lower at 50%.
C: Scenario reflection almost no treatment benefit. 
D: Same scenario as A and B, but with a lower maximum treatment benefit.
The calculations for the PoCC step have been performed using DoseFinding R -package [ R15-
2001 ]. Calculations were performed using R version 3.4.2 . The R codes for the sample size 
calculations as well as the anal yses using the MCPMod approach will be provided in the 
TSAP.

52% on BI 730357 200 mg b.i.d. and 400mg q.d., respectivel y, when assuming sample sizes 
for BI 730357 200 mg b.i.d. , 400 mg q.d.and placebo group are 40, 40 and 10, respectivel y,

and 2) relevance P( BI –PBO > 0.4 0 | Data) > 0.5, if there is a truly treatment difference of 
40% in r esponse rates, the given sample size provides a chance of >90% to detect the 
treatment benefit in at least one active dose group . A “passed” indicates at least one dose 
satisfies both significance and relevance criteria; A “ not passed” indicates neither dose 
satisfies either of these two criteria. Table 7.7: 2presents the probabilities of decisions under 
different cases.

10.1 PASI SCORE DEFINITIO N AND USE
The PASI  score is an established measure of clinical e fficacy  for psoriasis medications ( R96-
3541 ).
The PASI  is a tool which provides a numeric scoring for patients overall psoriasis disease 
state, ranging from 0 to 72. I t is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is 
affected and the severity  of ery thema, infiltration, and desquamation over four body  regions.
The endpoints used are based on the percent reduction from baseline, generally  summarized 
as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X% reductio n (or PASI  X), where X is 
50, 75, 90 and 100.
To calculate the PASI  score, the four main body  areas are assessed: head (h), trunk (t), 
upper extremities (u) and lower extremities (l) . These correspond to 10, 30, 20 and 40% of 
the total body  area respective ly.
The area of psoriatic involvement of these four areas (Ah, At, Au, and Al) is given a 
numerical value: 0 = no involvement, 1 = <10%, 2 = 10 to <30%, 3 = 30 to <50%, 4 = 50 to 
<70%, 5 = 70 to <90%, and 6 = 90 to 100% involvement.
The signs of severity, erythema (E), infiltration (I) and desquamation (D) of lesions are 
assessed using a numeric scale [ADDRESS_527296] possible involvement; scores are made independently  for each of the areas, h, 
t,u and l and represents a composite score for each area. An illustration of judging erythema 
follows: 0 = no erythema, 1 = slight ery thema, 2 = moderate ery thema, 3 = striking ery thema, 
and 4 = exceptionall y striking erythema.
The PASI  score is calculated according to the following formula:
PASI  = 0.1(Eh+Ih+Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et+It+Dt)At + 0.2(Eu+Iu+Du)Au + 0.4(El+I l+Dl)Al
10.2 STATIC PHYSICIAN GLO BAL ASSESSMENT (SPGA )
The sPGA used in this trial is a 5 point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the phy sician’s 
assessment of the average thickness, ery thema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions ( Table 
10.2: 1 ) (!"#$ #%&& '. The assessment is considered “static” which refers to the patients 
disease state at the time of the assessments, without comparison to any  of the subject’s 
previous disease states, whether at Baseline or at a previous visit.
A lower score indicates less body  coverage, with [ADDRESS_527297] clear.
The Investigator (or qualified site personnel) scores the ery thema, induration and scaling of 
all psoriatic lesions from 0 -4 based on the following descriptors:
Erythema
0Normal (post -inflammatory  hyper/hy popi[INVESTIGATOR_417803])
1Faint, diffuse pi[INVESTIGATOR_82637] 
2Mild (light red coloration)
3Definite red coloration (Dull to bright red)
4Bright to Deep red coloration of lesions

Scoring: a composite score is generated from the above data and the final sPGA is 
determined from this composite score as follows:
Clear 0 = [ADDRESS_527299] clear 1 = mean >0, <1.5
Mild 2 = mean >= 1.5, <2.5
Moderate 3 = mean >= 2.5, <3.5

10.3 NAP SI: NAIL PSORIASIS SEVERITY INDEX
The NAPSI  assesses how much of the fingernail is affected with psoriasis with scores ranging 
from 0 to 80.
If a patient has nail psoriasis, the phy sician will assess the nail psoriasis at each protocol 
defined time point. Fingers (5) on each hand will be individually  examined for two distinct 
assessments and are graded as follows:
Nail Matrix Assessment:
0 = None
1 = present in 1 quadrant of nail
2 = present in 2 quadrants of nail
3 = present in 3 quadrants of nail
4 = present in 4 quadrants of nail
Nail Bed Assessment:
0 = None
1 = present in 1 quadrant of nail
2 = present in 2 quadrants of nail
3 = present in 3 quadrants of nail
4 = present in 4 quadrants of nail
The sum of the scores will be added resulting a range of 0 to 80. If an individual finger 
assessment is missing (not done), the average of th e remaining measured digits will be 
imputed and added to the sum. I f < 50% of the finger assessments are missing the imputation 
will be performed. If more than 50% of the assessments are missing then the sum of the 
scores will be left as missing.
10.4 PPASI : PA LMOPLANTAR PSORIASIS SEVERITY INDEX
The PPASI  provides a numeric scoring for psoriasis affecting the hands and feet with scores 
ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of hands and feet 
that are affected and the severit yof ery thema, induration, and desquamation.
If a patient has palmoplantar psoriasis, the ph ysician will assess the psoriasis at each protocol 
defined time point. Both palms and soles on each hand and foot will be individually  assessed 
for ery thema, indurat ion, desquamation and percentage of area affected as follows:
 Erythema, Induration and Desquamation:

1 = Slight
2 = Moderate
3 = Severe
4 = Very  Severe
 Percent of Palm and Sole Area Covered:
0 = Clear
1 = <10%
2 = 10 -29%
3 = 30 -49%
4 = 50 -69%
5 = 70-89%
6 = 90 -100%
The PPASI  is a composite score and will be computed for each palm and sole, left and right 
and is derived from the sum of the scores for ery thema (E), induration (I) and desquamation 
(D) multiplied by  [CONTACT_417831].
PPASI  is calculated as follows: (sum of scored for E+I+D)*Area *0.2( location: right palm) + 
(sum of scored for E+I+D)*Area *0.2(location:left palm) + (sum of scored for 
E+I+D)*Area*0.3( location: right sole) +(sum of scores f or E+I+D)*Area *0.3( location: left
sole). The range is 0 to 72.
10.5 PSORIASIS SCALP SEVE RITY INDEX (PSSI)
If a patient has scalp psoriasis, the phy sician will assess the ery thema (redness), induration 
(hardness), desquamation (shedding of skin) and percent of scalp covered at each protocol 
defined time point.
 Erythema, Induration and Desquamation:
0 = None
1 = Slight
2 = Moderate
3 = Severe
4 = Very  Severe
 Percent of Scalp Covered:
1 = <10%
2 = 10 -29%
3 = 30 -49%
4 = 50 -69%
5 = 70 -89%
6 = 90 -100%
The PSSI  is acomposite score derived from the sum of the scores for erythema, induration 
and desquamation multiplied by  [CONTACT_417832]. The 
range is 0 to 72.

The DLQI is a subject -administ ered, ten -question, quality  of life questionnaire that covers six 
domains including s ymptoms and feelings, dail y activities, leisure, work and school, personal 
relationships and treatment ( R05-2548 ). The DLQI has a one -week recall period. Item scores 
range from 0 (not relevant /not at all ) to 3 (very  much). Question 7 is a “y es”/ “no” question 
where “y es” is scored as 3.
DLQI total score is calculated by  [CONTACT_417833] a range of 
0 to 30 where 0-1 = no effect on subject’s life, 2 -5 = small effect, 6 -10 = moderate effect, 11-
20 = very  large effect, and 21 -30 = extremel y large effect on subject’s life. The higher the 
score, the more the quality  of life is impaired. A 4-point change from baseline is considered a 
clinically  important difference.
10.7 PSORIASIS SYMPTOM SC ALE (PSS) 
The PSS will be completed by [CONTACT_417834] V1.
The PSS is a four -item patient- reported outcome (PRO) instrument that assesses the severity  
of ps oriasis sy mptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. The s ymptoms included 
are: pain, redness, itching and burning from psoriasis. Current sy mptom severity  is assessed 
for a 24 hour recall period using a 5 -point verbal rating scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very  
severe). The PSS was developed based on published evidence supporting the development of 
two similar, proprietary  patient -reported outcome instruments: the Psoriasis Sy mptom 
Inventory  and the Psoriasis Sy mptom Diary . These measures were developed in accordance 
with FDA PRO Guidance and have published evidence of reliability , validity , and abilit y to 
detect change (R14-3562 , R14-3559 , 
R15-1219 , R15-1410 , R15-1411 ). 
Psoriasis Sy mptom Scale 
Listed below are a set of problems that people with psoriasis have said are important. For 
each question, tick the box that best describes the severit y of your s ymptoms during the past 
[ADDRESS_527304] 24 hours?

10.8 PAIN VAS
The Pain VAS will be self -administered b y the patient (for PsA patients) at visits indicated in 
the FLOW CHART, Part 1 and FLOW CHART, Part 2 . 
The patient’s assessment of pain will be performed using a horizontal 1 00 m m visual analog 
scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain) after the que stion:
“How much pain have you had because of your psoriatic arthritis in the past week? 
Place a vertical (│) mark on the line to indic ate the severit y of the pain.”

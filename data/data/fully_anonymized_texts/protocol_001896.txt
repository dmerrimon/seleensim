1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR SCHEMA  
This is a single institution phase II trial designed to assess  the therapeutic activity of HLA partially 
matched  third party  donor -derived CMVpp65  specific  T-cells (adimlecleucel)  for the treatment  of CMV 
infection  or persistent  CMV  viremia  after allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  solid organ 
transplant, human immunodeficiency virus, other immunocompromised states, and immune 
competent subjects who require therapy.  T-cells for infusion will be generated from seropositive 
healthy thi rd party donors, by [CONTACT_353371] a pool of 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_353315]65.  
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
Primary  Objectives:  
 
1. To assess in a single arm Phase II trial, the therapeutic activity of third party donor derived 
adimlecleucel  for the treatment  of clinically  overt CMV infection or  CMV viremia  that is  persistent 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 2 weeks  of treatment with antiviral agents such  as Ganciclovir and /or foscarnet  by: 
a. Partial  or Complete  decrease  in CMV  DNA  viral load 
b. Partial  or Complete  resolution  of CMV  disease  
2. Determine  the risk  of inducing GvHD or  increasing its severity by [CONTACT_353372] r of third party 
donor derived adimlecleucel.  
Secondary  Objectives:  
 
1. Determine safety data regarding the use of third party donor derived adimlecleucel for the 
treatment of CMV viremia and disease.  
2. Determine  the degree to  which  treatment  with adimlecleucel  can eliminate  or reduce  the exposure 
to antiviral agents such as gan ciclovir and foscarnet and thus reduce the associated morbidity 
from organ specific toxicity of antiviral  agents.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the herpes virus family of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
viruses,  which  can infect several  types of  cells within the  body (epi[INVESTIGATOR_018], endothelial,  hematopoietic, 
and connective  tissue  cells).  CMV  is a large  virus  encoding  approximately [ADDRESS_439933] permanently and may reactivate at times of 
immunosuppression  or compromise,  though  the cellular site  of latency is  not well  understood.  T cell- 
mediated  immunit y is the primary  immunological  control  for CMV and loss  of this immunity  can result 
in reactivation of CMV into the lytic phase and progression to organ involvement with consequent 
injury or death (1).  
Clinically significant  CMV reactivations follow alloge neic hematopoietic cell  transplant (alloHCT) and 
solid organ  transplant  (SOT).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_353316]-emptive  therapy,  reactivation  of latent  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 14 -070 A(23)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_439934]  commonly  occurs  between  30 to 100  days after  transplant, with  a median  of about 
40 days after transplant (2).  
Reactivation rates vary among  seropositive HCT  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353317], 
patient  age, and  source  of stem  cells,  with T cell depletion  and cord-blood transplants resulting  in the 
highest reactivation rates. It is noteworthy, however, that T -cells depleted grafts from seropositive 
donors  do not transmit  CMV to  seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The  increasing  use of haploidentical  alloHCT 
appears  to result  in increased  risk of reactivation  (3, 4). Although  prophylactic or  preemptive  treatment 
with ganciclovir or  foscarnet  has reduced  the incidence  and mortality of  early CMV infections in HLA - 
matched  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840](5,  6), in 6-30% of  cases,  treatment  may be hampered  or cannot  be sustained  due 
to complicating myelosuppression  or nephrotoxicity (7, 8).  Prolonged anti -viral treatment may also  
delay the  recovery  of virus -specific  immune  responses,  leading  to a significant  incidence  of late onset 
disease.  After  3 months of  treatment  with ganciclovir, late CMV  infection was reported by [CONTACT_353373]. in 17.8% of 146 seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -matched unmodified marrow  transplants (9, 10). 
These  late infections were  lethal in 46%  of cases,  and were  associated  with persistent  deficiencies in 
absolute  numbers  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and CMV -specific T -cells (9, 10). In our  own study  of 255 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -matched CD34+E- T-cell depleted HCT who did not receive post transplant 
immunosuppression,  the cumulative  incidence of  CMV  reactivation among  seropositive patients was 
similar  to that reported  following  unmodified  HCT (58%  vs 40-60%),  and only 12% developed clinically 
overt disease (11). However, similar to findings reported for unmodified allo HCTs, deficiencies of 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were  significantly associated with disease (10, 11).  
CMV infections are particularly dangerous in seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353318] -identical HCT. For 
example, while the overall mortality of CMV infections in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -matched HCT has been 
reduced to 3 -5% (12, 13), mortality rates of 13 -16% have been reported among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] - 
haplotype disparate T -cell depleted grafts (14). Similarly, for seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353319]ïve cord blood transplants, the cumulative incidence of clinically 
significant CMV disease has been reported to be as high as 29%, with mortality rates of 6% to 9% 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_353320] (15 -17). 
SOT patients may receive prophylactic therapy prior to CMV reactivation or pre -emptive therapy at 
the time of CMV viremia  detection  to reduce  the risk of progressive  CMV  infection.  Approximately  1% 
of SOT patients  develop  ganciclovir  resistance  (18), which  can lead to organ  damage,  organ  loss, and 
sometimes death (19). Patients undergoing lung transplant may have higher rates of ganciclovir 
resistance, ranging from 3% -10% (20, 21).  
In SOT patients, CMV infections are most common in donor seropositive/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353321]. In the alloHCT setting, donor 
seronegative/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353322].  
Adoptive  Immunotherapy  for CMV  
Healthy seropositive  individuals  contain  high frequencies of  CMV and EBV -specific  CD4 [+] and CD8 
[+] T-cells,  ranging from  0.4 - 3% of  the total T -cell population,  that play a  critical  role in controlling in

 these latent viral infections (22). The potential of virus -specific T -cells to control CMV and  EBV 
infections was initially suggested by [CONTACT_353374] -specific  CD8+  cytotoxic T -cells and the  potential of  allogeneic  HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353323]-induced  disease  (23-25). Subsequently,  we and others  have demonstrated  that adoptive  transfer 
of in vitro generated transplant donor -derived virus specific T -cells can clear life -threatening clinical 
CMV infections and induce durable remissions of clonal EBV -induced lymphomas emer ging after 
allogeneic HCT (26 -38). Our group provided the first demonstration of the potential of DLI to treat 
EBV lymphomas  in 1994  (33). Since  then,  we have been  conducting  a trial of transplant  donor  derived 
EBV-specific T -cells in the treatment of biop sy proven monoclonal EBV  lymphomas post allogeneic 
HCT. In our initial experience, three weekly infusions of 106 EBVCTL/Kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353324] 13/19 (68%) patients treated (30, 31).  
Riddell et al.(39) were the first to demonstrate  the feasibility and clinical efficacy of CMV specific T - 
cells for the  prophylaxis  and treatment of  CMV reactivation in post  transplant patients.  In this study, 
14 patients with persistent CMV viremia or those at high risk were treated with 4 escalating weekly 
doses  of CMV -specific CD8+  T-cell clones  (107, 3x 107, 108 and 109/m2) using  donor peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) sensitized with autologous CMV infected fibroblasts.  All [ADDRESS_439935] treated for persistent CMV viremia unresponsive to 
antiviral drugs with infusion of  5 x 105 – 1 x 106 CMV specific T -cells/kg  or 103- 104 CMVpp65 
responsive  IFNγ+ T-cells/kg  (29, 35-37). Thus studies  by [CONTACT_353375] (29),  and Einsele  et al (35), used 
1 x 105/kg (Peggs)  or 3.3 x 105/kg (Einsele ) CMV  specific  T-cells for treating CMV  viremia  or infections 
in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353325] 19/24  treated  patients,  with no grade 
2 or greater GvHD.  Micklethwaite et al.(36) prophylactically infused 5 x 105CMVpp65 -CTL/kg  for 
prevention of CMV infections in [ADDRESS_439936] with  only 4/12 patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_353326]. Feuchtinger et al.(37) treated [ADDRESS_439937] from  HLA– 
mismatched/ haploidentical or HLA –matched unrelated donors with 2 x 104 IFNγ+ polyclonal 
CMVpp65 -CTL /kg, 15/[ADDRESS_439938] CMV  using PBMC or  autologous dendritic cells 
(DCs)  loaded with viral lysate (29, 35), or autologous DCs transduced with CMVpp65  (28). A th ird 
approach employs the isolation of interferon -γ+ T-cells CliniMACS using IFNγ capture microbeads 
(Miltenyi  Biotec) (37). 
Our phase I trial of transplant donor -derived CMVpp65 peptide specific T -cells (IRB 05 -065) has 
completed  accrual  and required  follow up and is being readied  for publication.  Overall,  8/10 evaluable 
patients that had failed ganciclovir and/or foscarnet  durably cleared CMV viremia after single doses 
of 0.5, 1 or 2 x 106 CMVpp65 -CTLs/kg; all 6 patients treated with 3 weekly doses of 1 x 106/kg 
CMVpp65 CTLs cleared CMV viremia.  Elimination of CMV was consistently correlated with 
increments  in circulating  CMVpp65 -CTL of the  same  epi[INVESTIGATOR_353327] Vβ usage  as the infuse d 
CMVpp65 -CTL. Detectable numbers of CMVpp65CTLs were sustained for 2 -4 months.  Acute 
toxicities were rare, no patient developed de novo GvHD.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_439939] application and/or 
effectiveness of adoptive T -cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_353328], until recently, have been 
intractable. First  among these  is the difficulty of treating CMV infections in seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353329], immunologically naïve donors, specifically, previously unexposed 
adults or, as is now most  common,  cord blood transplants (CBT).  For most  of these cases,  CMV - 
specific  T-cells cannot b e generated from the transplant donors ex vivo. While virus  -specific T -cells 
can sometimes  be generated from CBT  (40), the  donor -derived cells required to  generate the T -cells 
are often no longer available.  Furthermore, the T -cells generated are of low af finity and as yet 
minimally tested in terms of therapeutic  efficacy (40).  
The second  major limitation is logistic in nature; the acuity and severity of CMV infections demand 
prompt therapy, but 4 -6 weeks of in vitro culture are required to generate CMV -specific T -cells of 
appropriate specificity that are adequately depleted of contaminating alloreactive cells capable of 
causing GvHD. CMV -specific T -cells can be isolated directly from donor -derived leukapheresis by 
[CONTACT_353376]/HLA tetramer+ T -cells of after short -term sensitization with antigen - 
presenting cells expressing CMV proteins or loaded with immunogenic CMV peptide by 
[CONTACT_353377] T -cells expressing activation markers or secreting interferon γ. However, the 
yields of T -cells isola ted in this way are limited and their potential to clear  clinically overt infection is 
thus far largely untested (29, 35). Furthermore, such  preparations still incur a risk  of GvHD even in 
HLA-matched recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
The third limitation affects patients who h ave received transplants from HLA disparate donors, and 
derives  from the fact that T-cells isolated  directly  from the blood  or generated  in vitro after sensitization 
with CMV lysates or peptide pools are  usually responsive to  only 1 -3 CMV immunodominant  peptide 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_353330]. As a result, such  T-cells are ineffective in an 
HLA disparate  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353331], since 
they cannot recogniz e or kill patient cells infected with the virus.  
A promising  new approach  that addresses  these  limitations  and can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_353332].  Haque et  al (32)  provided initial demonstrations that  3rd 
party EBV -specific  T-cells selected  only on  the basis  of partial HLA matching,  could  induce complete 
remissions (CR) of EBV -LPD complicating organ allografts. In their initial study of 8 patients, 3 
achieved  CR (41). In a subsequent  multicenter  study  of 33 patients 13  (39%)  achieved  sustained  CRs 
(32). Subsequently, we  demonstrated that adoptive transfer of HLA partially matched third party 
donor -derived EBV -specific T -cells could also induce durable CRs in two patie nts who developed 
Rituximab -resistant  monoclonal  EBV lymphomas  following  allogeneic  cord blood transplants  (22). We 
have  now used  third party EBV  CTL to treat 46  patients with  Rituximab  and/or  chemotherapy  resistant 
EBV lymphomas that developed after allogenic  HCT (N=33), or organ transplants (N=13), (Protocol 
95-024 and 11 -130, IND 6834)  (23). Of the initial [ADDRESS_439940] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  22 achieved durable CRs  (N=19) 
or PRs (N=3); of  the [ADDRESS_439941] disease that responded to topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588].

 In the course  of our Phase I trial evaluating transplant donor -derived CMVpp65 -specific T -cells for 
adoptive  therapy  of patients with  overt CMV  disease  or CMV  viremia  persisting  for more  than 2  weeks 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_175639] (IRB 05 -065; IND [ZIP_CODE]) we introduced an ame ndment to also permit the 
use of HLA partially matched  CMVpp65  –specific T -cells from third party donors for patients whose 
own donors were either seronegative (e.g. cord blood or seronegative adult donors) or were 
unavailable or unwilling to  provide cells  for adoptive therapy.  
[ADDRESS_439942] administered to the affected patient (i.e. third - 
party donors),  in the treatment  of CMV infection or  persistent  viremia.  This protocol  (IRB 12 -086A(6)) 
was approved by  [CONTACT_353378]. Thus  far, [ADDRESS_439943] from whom CMV -specific CTLs from their transplant donor were not 
available. (IRB 14 -070).  
Thus far,  we treated [ADDRESS_439944] party  donor derived CMVpp65 -specific T -cells 
between 10/14/11 and 11/28/16, evaluable for response assessment  as of 6/20/17.  Patients had 
received an unmodified (N=11) T -cell depleted HCT (N=33) or cord blood (n=6), t ransplant. Fifteen 
were  treated  for overt  CMV disease  involving  CNS  (N=6), GI  (N=10)  and Lung  (N=2) and  35 for CMV 
viremia persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] >2 weeks of induction therapy with 1 -3 antiviral agents. Patients had 
received a median of 3 (1 -6) prior antiviral  treatments.  
Third  party  CMVpp65 -CTLs  were  selected  from a bank  of lines generated under  GMP conditions  from 
normal HCT donors who specifically consented to use of their T cells in patients other than their 
designated transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Selection was made  on the basis of HLA  restriction by [CONTACT_353379], and m atching  for > 2/10 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353333]. If such  a 
line was not available,  a patient  could be treated with a line matched  at only  one HLA allele  as long

 as the restriction was through that matched allele. Patients received 3 weekly infusions of 
approximately  1x106  CMVpp65 -CTL/kg/infusion.  Patients  were  sequentially  evaluated for  clinical  and 
radiographic  changes,  quantifications  of CMV DNA  by [CONTACT_353380]+  CMVpp65 -specific  T-cells in the 
blood.  Responses were assessed [ADDRESS_439945] of each cycle of CMVpp65 -CTLs. 
Response in patients with CMV disease was considered complete (CR) if all sites were cleared of 
virus by [CONTACT_353381]  (PR) if symptoms  resolved  and viremia met  criteria  of 
PR. In patients treated for persistent  viremia, responses  were  complete  if CMV DNA was  cleared in 
repeated  testing,  and partial if  the level of  CMV  fell based  on the testing  method  by >50%  (N=2)  or by 
2xLog10 (N=12).  
Of the 50  patients 18 had a  complete  and 14 a partial response  for an overall response  rate of 64%. 
Response rates in patients with disease (5CR+4PR/15) were similar to those of patients with 
persistent  viremia (13CR+10PR/35).  In patients treated for viremia alone, survival at 6 months was 
65.7% and in those with disease 60.0% (a). More exte nsively pretreated patients who received 
CMVpp65  CTLs >  [ADDRESS_439946] CMV initial  detection fared as well as those treated earlier (62.1% 
vs. 66.7% OS)  (b). Patients who  responded to CMVpp65 -CTL therapy (CR or  PR) had an improved 
survival with 6  month  overall survival of 81.3% (b)  and 12 month  overall survival of 62.1% (c);  only [ADDRESS_439947]  7 of 18 non -responding patients died of CMV; overall 
survival in this cohort was  33.3% at 6 months.  By 12 months,  8 non-responding pa tients had died of 
CMV and overall  survival had decreased to 22.2%.  
Toxicities associated with CMVpp65 -CTL infusions in this cohort are limited with 5 patients 
experiencing  adverse  events  of > grade  [ADDRESS_439948] treated patients on single patient use/eINDs for 
refractory CMV oc curring after SOT  (N=2) and HIV (N=2).  These patients have not experience a 
toxicity profile to suggest  different toxicities than HCT patients who have received CMVpp65 -CTLs 
and no serious adverse events were submitted.

Patients will receive adimlecleucel selected from our bank of GMP grade adimlecleucel lines 
generated from  normal HCT  donors specifically  consented  for this purpose.  The third party ATA230 
to be administered  will be selected  on the basis  of 1) sharing  of at least  one HLA allele  with the patient, 
and 2) HLA restriction  of the CMVpp65CTL  by [CONTACT_353382].  
CTLs for infusion will be generated by [CONTACT_353383] T -cells over 28 days 
using  autologous  dendritic cells  (DCs)  or EBV transformed  B cells loaded  with a pool of 138 synthetic 
peptides  spanning  the sequence  of CMVpp65.  (confer  section 5.[ADDRESS_439952] Operating 
Procedures).  Adimlecleucel to be infused will be characterized as to immunophenotype, CMVpp65 
peptide epi[INVESTIGATOR_76802],  HLA restrictions  and TCR  Vβ usage so  as to be  able to  track disposition, 
and longevity  of these T -cells post infusion.  
Concurrent  Therapy  : Antivirals  and Immunosuppression  
 
All patients receiving anti -viral drugs may  be maintained at their current  doses during treatment with 
CTLs.  Patients can  continue treatment with rapamycin and calcineurin inhibitors.  However, steroid 
doses must  be adjusted so  that: Patients are receiving no more  than 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone or its 
equivalent.  
Characterization  and Monitoring  of CMV  infections  and T-cell Responses:  
Prior  to and at  specific  intervals following infusion of adimlecleucel, patients will be monitored  for : 1) 
vital signs and clinical  and radiologic responses  at sites  of CMV infection, 2)  level of  circulating CMV 
DNA  by [CONTACT_954],  and levels of adimlecleucel  in the blood as measured  by [CONTACT_353384], CMVpp65 -specific IFNγ+ T -cells (42), or epi[INVESTIGATOR_353335] -T-cells binding HLA -peptide 
tetramers and their Vβ usage (43).  The third party T -cells will also be monitored by [CONTACT_353385]65 IFNγ+  T-cells as to their genetic  origin.  Patients  will also be monitored  for any toxicities as 
described in section 11.0.

of T-cells against CMV or EBV for a period of [ADDRESS_439954]  100 fold  (45). Therefore, 
in the  doses  of adimlecleucel  proposed  for treatment in  this trial (1x  106/kg x 3 T-cells /kg),  the doses 
of potentially  alloreactive T -cells administered would be estimated  to be below  the GvHD  threshold. 
In practice, the CMVpp65CTL after this culture period do not contain detectable allocytoxic activity 
against patient or  fully allogeneic PHA blasts.  Indeed, this lack of alloreactivity is a release criterion 
that must  be met  to use  the cells for  treatment.  
Our clinical  experience also  confirms  this. In our Phase  I trial of  CMVpp65CTL,  no patient developed 
GvHD. Similarly, none of the 19 patients with EBV  lymphomas in our initial study developed GvHD 
when  treated with  transplant  donor derived EBV  specific  T-cells sensitized  for 4 weeks with  irradiated 
autologous EBV BLCLs  at doses ranging from 15 -150 x 105 T-cells/kg (29).  Rooney et al (27), also 
observed  no cases  of GvHD among  39 patients treated prophylactically with  transplant donor  derived 
EBV specific  T-cells generated by  a similar  technique over  a dose  range of  3.3 – 33 x 105 T-cells /kg. 
Similarly,  in our studies  of HCT patients  treated  with third party  virus -specific  T-cells for either  rituximab

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
5.1 Donors  of CMV -Specific  T-cells  
 
The CMV -specific T -cell lines to be used for treatment in this protocol and to be maintained 
cryopreserved  under  GMP conditions  in the Adoptive  Immune  Cell Therapy  Facility  at MSKCC,  will be 
derived from the groups listed below:  
1. Normal,  HLA typed, CMV -seropositive related  and unrelated  hematopoietic cell  transplant 
donors  who have consented  to provide blood or  blood  white  cells to make  CMV -specific T - 
cells for treatment of CMV in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353336] -specific T -cells for  another  patient, at such  time as the 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353337].

 2. Normal, healthy HLA typed, C MV-seropositive volunteer blood donors who consent to 
provide blood or blood white cells to make CMV -specific T -cells for treatment of CMV 
infections  in transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353338]  T cells may add to the HLA  diversity of  the T cells 
available in the Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Bank.  
Normal donors are evaluated for  evidence of  prior sensitization  to CMV by [CONTACT_353388]. Adequate 
health for donation will be ascertained according to institutional (related donor), NMDP (unrelated 
donor)  or AABB (normal  blood donors) guidelines.  They are  also typed for  HLA A, B,  C, DR and DQ. 
Clinical studies for donors are obtained within [ADDRESS_439956]  be within a range 
that would not preclude donating blood or undergoing l eukapheresis.  
Serologic testing for transmissible  diseases is performed as per each department’s guidelines or at 
the discretion of the treating attending.  
For prospective transplant donors, an informed consent  will be obtained and up to 2 blood samples 
will be collected: Consenting volunteer  blood donors will  be requested to  provide a leukopheresis.  
Generation  of Antigen  Presenting  cells (Dendritic  cells and EBV BLCL  ) and Peptide  Loading  of APCs  
The DCs  used for T -cell sensitization are generated from PBMCs isolated from blood leucocytes by 
[CONTACT_138789] -Hypaque  gradient separation and  enriched  for monocytes  by [CONTACT_353389]14 clinical grade microbeads (milte nyi) if the 
frozen/thawed PBMC is used.  The monocytes are then re -suspended at a concentration of 1 x 106 
cells/ml in RPMI supplemented with 1% heat inactivated autologous serum (if available) or 
prescreened heat inactivated human AB serum (Gemini) clinica l grade GMCSF  (2000 IU/ml) and 
interleukin -4 (1000 IU/ml).  The cultures are supplemented with these cytokines on days 2 and 4 in 
fresh  medium as indicated by [CONTACT_353390].  On days 5 or 6, 5 ng/ml of TNFα , 2.5 mg/ml  of IL-1β, 75 
µg/ml of IL-6 and 0.5µg/ml PGE -2 are added for 48 hours to induce maturation of dendritic cells. 
Thereafter, the dendritic cells  are washed,  adjusted  to a concentration of  1 x 106/ml, and loaded with 
the pool (25µg complete pool/ml) of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_353339] -pp65 synthetic pep tides (Invitrogen, [LOCATION_011] 
[LOCATION_005]) in serum free medium at 37ºC for 3 hours and used for T -cell sensitization as 
described below.  
EBV transformed  B cells are  generated as  described  previously (46),  adjusted  to a concentration  of 1 
x 106/ml, and loade d with 25µg CMVpp65  peptide pool/ml in serum  free medium at  37ºC for 3  hours 
and used for T -cell sensitization.  
Generation  of CMVpp65  Specific  T-cells (adimlecleucel)  
 
T-cells will be generated  as described  in published  reports  and detailed  in the appendices  (45). Briefly, 
CD3+  enriched  T-cell fractions  are initially  isolated by  [CONTACT_153531]-hypaque gradient separation of  peripheral 
blood  leucocytes.  Thereafter,  monocytes  are depleted  by [CONTACT_353391]14 immunomagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi 
Biotechnology, Gmbh,  Gladback, [LOCATION_013])  if done from  frozen/thawed  PBMC.  The CD56+ NK+ cells 
and B cells are then removed by [CONTACT_353392] s coated with clinical 
grade mouse monoclonal antibody specific for CD56 and CD19 respectively (CliniMACS CD56 
reagent,  Miltenyi  Biotechnology, Gmbh,  Gladback, [LOCATION_013]).  Aliquots of  1 x 106 T-cells /ml will then

 be stimulated with 0.5 x 105/ml autologous irradiated monocyte - derived DC or with EBV BLCL 
previously  loaded  with a pool of 138 synthetic  overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_353340]65.  The stimulated  T-cells will then  be cultured  in modified  Yssel’s medium  supplemented 
with 5% pre-screened  heat inactivated human  AB serum  in sterile  flasks at  37ºC,  with 5%  CO2 in air. 
The culture will be re -stimulated with the peptide loaded DCs or EBV BLCL at an effector to target 
ratio of 10:1 at 7 day intervals for 21 -28 days.  Clinical grade IL -2 (Chiron) will be added to a 
concentration  of 10-80 IU/ml  every  3 days,  beginning  on day 7 and IL-15 weekly  at the dose  of 10ng/ml 
(stimulation with DCs does not potentiate significant expansio n of T -cells.  The earlier initiation of 
cytokine stimulation  at higher  doses  permits  generation of  higher numbers  of T-cells to meet  the dose 
requirements in  the protocol.  IL-15 has been described  as a potent stimulator  of T-cell expansion in - 
vitro. After 21 -28 days in culture, the T -cells will be harvested, counted and tested for potency, 
specificity and lack of alloreactivity, microbiological sterility, and for levels of endotoxin (confer 
appended Standard operating procedures).  If a sufficient number of T -cells is obtained, the T -cells 
will then be  aliquoted into  sterile  vials in calculated  doses  tested  as detailed below  and cryopreserved 
for subsequent administration to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353341]’s HCT or for a third party reci pi[INVESTIGATOR_353342],  for treatment of CMV infection or persistent  viremia.  If additional numbers of T -cells are 
required, the pre -generated adimlecleucel will be further expanded using OKT3,  IL2 and autologous 
feeders as described  in our currently active cl inical trial using WT1  CTLs (IRB#07 -055) 
The dendritic cells,  EBV BLCL  and T -cell lines will be  generated in the  designated Adoptive Immune 
Cell Therapy facility of MSKCC under controlled GMP conditions.  
Characterization  of CMVpp65 -specific  T-cells (adimlecleucel)  
 
Depending on their growth, T -cell cultures will be evaluated after 21 -28 days of culture for the 
proportion of  CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and content  of CD3- CD56+ NK cells and CD20+  Cells.  They  will 
also be evaluated for  their content  of CMVpp 65 specific  IFNγ+ CD8+/CD4+ T-cells in response  to short 
secondary  stimulation  with autologous  PBMC  loaded  with CMVpp65  peptide pool.  Specificity  will also 
be ascertained  by [CONTACT_353393][INVESTIGATOR_353343], as well as fully allogeneic EBV BLCL.  The matrix of 
pentadecapeptide  subpools approach  described  by [CONTACT_203623] (34)  will be used  to identify specific 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_353344]γ responses  with the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells.  The T-cells will  also be tested  for 
their capacity  to lyse both CMVpp65  peptide  loaded  targets  and CMV -infected  donor  and patient PHA 
blasts.  In addition, a panel of single HLA matched EBV BLCL, both loaded and unloaded with 
CMVpp65,  will be used  as targets for  in-vitro cytotoxicity  to determine  the HLA restriction  of the CMV 
specific T -cells generated (43, 45).

administration if:  
1. They  are microbiologically sterile,  free of  mycoplasma  and contain  ≤ 5 EU  of endotoxin/kg

7.2 Inclusion  of Women  and Minorities  
Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center has filed form HHS 441 (re: Civil Rights), form H HS 641 
(handicapped individuals), and form  639-A (re:  Sex Discrimination).  In selecting  patients for  study in 
the projects  proposed  in this protocol,  we have taken due  notice  of NIH/ADAMHA  policies  concerning 
inclusion of women and minorities in clinical r esearch populations.  We expect that the study 
population will be fully representative of the range of patients seen at Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353348], gender, or ethnic background.  Based on a January 1, 2001 - December  2005 
analysis  of patient  populations  on allogeneic  transplant  protocols  at this Center,  the racial  distributions 
were  24% African  American,  Hispanic  or Asian,  and 76% Caucasian.  The gender  distribution  was 41% 
female  and 59% male.  The protocol  is open  to all patients irrespective  of gender  or ethnic  background. 
The population of patients transplanted reflects the distribution of the patients in our tri -state referral 
area. However, it is anticipated that the distribution of patients by [CONTACT_353396], but that a higher proportion of individuals from 
minority racial groups will be accrued to the cord blood transplant protocols, both because of the 
greater HLA  disparity permissible  and the  concerted  efforts of  these  banks to  obtain do nor units from 
populations underrepresented in the NMDP.  Given the highly specific patient population that is 
subject/eligible for this treatment, the trial will be registered under clinical trials.gov to enable other 
transplant centers to review and refer  patients for treatment.  No other specific outreach efforts are 
planned for accrual.  
Pregnant  women  are excluded  from this study.  There  are no age restrictions  for this study,  and eligible 
children  will be  enrolled  if appropriate consents  are obtained  from parents and /or guardians.  
 
 
8.0 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
Prior to adimlecleucel infusion, eligible and consenting patients will be clinically assessed  for their 
general condition and for  extent of  CMV infection. Tests/exams  will be obtained within [ADDRESS_439965] infusion. Tests easily repeated (e.g. blood work and chest x -ray) will preferably be performed 
within 3 days of infusion. Certain tests  may be omitted at the discretion  of the treating physician:

Approval date: [ADDRESS_439967] donors or healthy 
donors, specifically consented  for this purpose, based  on having a partial match  of ≥ [ADDRESS_439968].  
Adimlecleucel will be administered in cycles  lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle,  subjects 
will receive  IV adimlecleucel  at a dose  of 1×106 cells/kg  (with  an acceptable  range  of 0.8 – 
1.2×106 cells/kg)  for 3 weeks or  total dosing of  2.4 – 3.6 x 106cell/kg per cycle  on days 0,  7, and 14. 
Tests  quantitating CMV viremia  by [CONTACT_353400][INVESTIGATOR_353351]  [ADDRESS_439969] ongoing disease 
and/or levels of  CMV DNA  in blood are  still detectable.  These secondary  courses  will usually employ 
T-cells from the same  third party  donor.  However, adimlecleucel  derived from  an alternate third  party 
donor’s  CMV pp65 -specific T -cells may  be used if  no further cells  from the same  donor are  available 
or for  patients with stable  or progressive  CMV infection refractory to antiviral drugs,  since  infusion of 
virus  specific  T-cells from a secondary  donor  specific for  a different  CMV  peptide  and restricted  by [CONTACT_353401][INVESTIGATOR_135991], in several cases, induced durable 
regression of disease (23).  
Subjects will generally  be treated for a maximum of [ADDRESS_439970] cycle.  Subjects with PD at the end of Cycle 1 or later, or who 
experience unacceptable toxicity, will be offered Switch  Therapy if appropriate.

 11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
One of the primary  objectives is to  continue to  identify the risk  of development  or flare of  pre-existing 
graft versus host disease.  
Graft  versus  Host  Disease.  The CMV peptide -specific T -cells have been cultured  for over [ADDRESS_439984] Disease (GvHD). 
In patients treated with third party -deriv ed virus -specific T -cells,  this risk  could be increased. 
This immune  reaction  against  the host can cause  skin rash,  hepatitis,  and enteritis.  In its most 
severe form, it can be fatal.  Were moderate to severe GvHD (Grade 2 -4) to develop, the 
patient will be  treated with  high doses  of glucocorticosteroids.  Additional  immunosuppressive 
agents may be used if the GvHD does not respond to steroid treatment. Patients who might 
subsequently rec eive donor lymphocytes,  boosts,  or a secondary  transplant will be  evaluable 
up until that time point.  
In Protocols  95-024, 05-065, 11-130, and 12-086, and  14-[ADDRESS_439985] party viral specific CTLs and two possibly related.  An additional 11 subjects,  with a 
history of GvHD, had GvHD after administration CTL administration; these cases were 
considered unrelated or unlikely related to CMV -CTLs. 
In this study,  we will be capturing  and tracking  Grade  3-5 toxicities  which  occur  within  30 days  following 
an infusion of adimlecleucel and are potentially attributable to treatment on study.  Toxicities which 
are attributable to underlying malignancy and/or were present  prior to initiation of therapy will not be 
tracked.  We will perform  assessment  of CRS  and ICANs  per institutional  standards  to align  with FACT 
requirements. Please see  section 17.2 for Serious Adverse Event reporting.  
11.1 Identified  risks  
1. Autoimmune  Hemolytic  Anemia.  Autoimmune  hemolytic  anemia  has been  reported  in 2 out of 
75 (2.6%)  patients treated  with CMV peptide -specific T -cells in prior  phase  [ADDRESS_439986]. 
Discussion with the medical monitor is encouraged.  
2. Specific  Immune Reactions.  The CMV peptide -specific T -cells are  expected to  migrate  to sites 
where CMV infected cells are concentrated, and to begin to kill these CMV infected cell 
populations.  These  cells may be concentrated  in the lung, liver, retina/central  nervous system,  or 
intestinal tract.  While  it is expected that the small  doses of T-cells administered  will take time  to 
replicate, and will exert their antiviral  effects over  a time period of days to weeks, it is possible 
that these  cells could concentrate in an infected tissue  and cause  more  severe inflammation as 
they attack virus  infected cells.  This could transiently increase the severity of a pneumonia or a 
CMV -induced  encephalitis,  retinitis,  hepatitis  or intestinal  infection,  and could  even  be life-

Approval date: [ADDRESS_439987]  Disease.  See section  11.0 
4. Hypoxia.  Hypoxia was  reported as an  SAE in  15 of  80 subjects  (18.8%)  treated with CMV -CTLs 
in Protocols  05-065, 12-086, and 14-070 (through  the safety  data-cut date of 29 April  2016).  None 
of the SAEs  were  considered  related  or likely related to  study  product;  [ADDRESS_439988] 
common underlying cause of hypoxia, though in many cases, clear alternate etiologies were 
present, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, parainfluenza, pulmonary embolus, 
botuli num infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, sepsis,  adenovirus pneumonia and fluid overload. 
Two cases were reported as possible local inflammatory response related to CMV -CTLs (at 
anatomic  site of CMV  antigen expression)  as playing a  role in hypoxia.  The possibi lity that a  cell- 
mediated response could make CMV pneumonia worse is considered a risk of therapy.  CMV 
pneumonia appeared  to be a final common  pathway  for the resistant  CMV infection in  a number 
of subjects for whom multiple antiviral  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_353357] -retinitis, these  T cells could  potentially cause  partial or 
complete blindness.  If this were the case,  immunosuppressive  drugs might be required to halt 
such  a reaction, and eliminate the T -cells.  Were this required, the antiviral activity of the T -cells 
would be removed and the infection could progress in the absence of any specific resistance.  
5. Allograft  Rejection.  Similar to  the concern  for GvHD  the CMV  pepti de-specific  T-cells have 
been  cultured  for over [ADDRESS_439989]  experienced renal allograft cellular rejection  which  was determined 
to be possible related to adimlecleucel.  
11.2 Theoretical  risks  
1. Acute Toxicities, Allergic Transfusion Reactions, and Cytokine Release Syndrome.  The 
infusion of CMV -peptide  specific  T-cells might cause  an acute  transfusion reaction or an allergic  
reaction to the cell infusion manifested by [CONTACT_353405]:  fever, shaking chills, difficulty breathing, a drop in the blood pressure, skin rash or 
swelling  of the  mucus  membranes  in the mouth  or vaginal  tract,  or impairment  of kidney  function. 
Based on prior experience with infusions of T -cells at our own and other institutions, the risk of 
such immediate toxicities is anticipated to be small.  However, each patient will be closely 
monitored for vital signs and clinical symptoms  prior to and following T -cell infusion.  Reactions 
will be treated  as clinically  indicated.  Similarly  our prior experience  and that of other  centers  predict 
that the risk of cytokine release syndrome  which  is characterized  by [CONTACT_353406].  Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_353358]230  will 
be assessed  for other  evidence of  cytokine release  syndrome  and treated for  it as per  institutional 
guidelines.  
2. Infection.  There  is a potential that  transfusions  of white  cells or  T-lymphocytes may  also serve  as 
vectors  of serious  infection.  All precautions to maintain  sterility will  be taken.  
3. Marrow Allograft Rejection.  Patients receiving third party donor -derived CMV specific T -cell 
infusions for treatment of CMV infection may be at risk of an acute rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_353359] T -cells.  This risk is expected to be very low, sinc e these T -cells only transiently 
engraft.  Indeed,  rejections have not  been observed in either marrow  or organ allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353360]: 14 -070 A(23)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_439990] party EBV -specific T -cells (31, 41).  Such epi[INVESTIGATOR_353361] T -cells are present in the T -cell inoculum. In allogeneic 
hematopoietic  cell transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  this could  lead to loss of the hematopoietic cell  transplant, 
resulting in marrow  aplasia, a potentially lethal complication.  Therefore, if severe leukopenia or 
thrombocytopenia is observed  that is potentially attributable to the infused  T-cells,  the patient will 
be treated with  prednisone and/ or anti -thymocyte globulin  to eliminate t he infused third party T - 
cells.  
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
The primary  endpoint of this study  is to assess  whether  the infusion of  adimlecleucel  has therapeutic 
activity  in curing  CMV  infections  in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_353362],  SOT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  HIV, other  immunocompromised 
states or immune competent  subjects who require therapy.  This study specifically will evaluate the 
therapeutic  efficacy  and persistence  after infusion of adimlecleucel  derived from third  party  donors for 
the treatme nt of CMV infections.  The second  clinical  end point of this study is safety, especially the 
evaluation of GvHD induction after infusion  of the  third party adimlecleucel.  
The responses  of CMV infections  will be clinically  monitored  as detailed under  section  10. Responses 
to adoptively  transferred T -cells are usually not observed until the T -cells have had time to expand 
within the  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841],  a period  of at least  [ADDRESS_439991] resolved 
and/or the patient no longer has  detectable CMV DNA by  [CONTACT_954].  
Partial response will be defined as a 2xLog 10 reduction in the level of CMV DNA detected in the 
patients blood and/or improvement in clinical parameters of CMV infection such that the patient is 
symptom -free. For patients with  a baseline CMV PCR  < 13,800 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  a partial response  will be 
defined as having a CMV PCR  of <137 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  on two occasions during the assessment  period.  
Stable disease  will be defined as no change in the clinic severity of disease in any organ and CMV 
DNA  is decreasing  by [CONTACT_353407] (reflecting an increase that can occur during in vivo expansion of CMV -CTLs)  and has not 
decreased by 2xLog 10. 
Progressive  disease  will be defined as disease progression by [CONTACT_353408], 
ascribable  to CMV infection in  any affected  organ, will  unchanged or increased  levels of CMV DNA.  
Patients lost  to followup either during therapy or  followup or  patients with cha nges  in antiviral therapy 
during treatment with adimlecleucel  such  that any changes in the extent of CMV viremia or disease 
cannot  be attributed  to cellular  therapy  will be defined  as not evaluable  for outcome 
assessment.  Patients evaluable for some  but not all cycles of cellular therapy will be evaluated as 
such.

13.0 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
In accordance  with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good Clinical Practice  Guidelines, and the US 
FDA Regulations,  a patient has  the right to  withdraw  from the study  at any time for any reason  without 
prejudice  to his/her  future  medical  care by [CONTACT_353409].  The Investigator also  has 
the right to withdraw patients from the study (see below). Should a patient (or a patient’s legally 
authorized representative) decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the 
observations as th oroughly as possible.  
A complete  final evaluation should be made  at the time  of the patient’s withdrawal, the Study Status 
Outcome  form in the  case  report form should  be completed  with an  explanation  of why  the patient  is 
withdrawing, and an attempt should  be made to perform a follow -up evaluation.  
Patients  may be removed  from study  if one or more  of the following  events  occur:  
• Withdrawal  of consent  by [CONTACT_1130]  
• Occurrence  of an AE that precludes  further  participation  
• Subject  chooses  to take a prohibited  treatment,  such  as use of a different  investigational 
medication or device  
• Refusal  of the patient  ot continue  treatment  observations  
• Significant  noncompliance  on the part of the patient  
• Development  of another disease  (e.g. Adenovirus  infection) that  requires  therapeutic intervention 
that would interfere with the interpretation of results from the study  
• Decision  by [CONTACT_127145]’s  best medical  interest  
• Lost to follow -up 
 
Patients who received a concomitant antiviral therapy due to toxicity of the current therapy or 
occurrence  of another viral infection will be replaced. Data regarding safety of the CTLs will still be 
collected for those patients.

16.0 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
This is a single institution trial and all patients will be treated at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer 
Center.  
A Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  ) will be assigned  to this study.  The responsibilities  of the CRC 
include project compliance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory 
monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of the protocol study 
team. The data manager will also monitor labora tory compliance throughout the study. Laboratory 
data will be tabulated  and summarized  based  on MSKCC normal ranges.  
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into the MSKCC  Clinical  Research  Data  Base  (CRDB).  
16.[ADDRESS_439997]  align with  the MSK DSM  Plan, 
where applicable.  
 
The Data  and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans  at Memorial Sloan Kettering were  approved by  [CONTACT_353411] 2018. The  plans address the  new policies set  forth by [CONTACT_353412] “Policy  of the  National  Cancer Institute for Data  and Safety Monitoring  of 
Clinical Trials.”  
 
There are several different mechanisms  by [CONTACT_353413], safety  and 
quality.  At a departmental/PI [INVESTIGATOR_353363](s).  Institutional  processes in place for quality assurance  include protocol monitoring, 
compliance  and data  verification  audits, staff education on  clinical  research  QA and two  institutional 
committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities  of our clinical trials programs. The 
committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the 
Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) for  Phase  III clinical  trials, report to the  Deputy  
Physician -in-Chief,  Clinical  Research.  
 
During  the protocol  development and review process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its level of 
risk and degree of monitoring required.

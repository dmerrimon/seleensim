3. Introductory Background  
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has emerged as an important 
alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement.  While this technology represents an important 
advance over medical therapy o r surgical AVR in poor operative candidates, the absolute 
mortality rates remain high, even in the great majority in whom an optimal hemodynamic result 
is achieved.  In the randomized literature, the majority of these patients die within two years and 
two thirds of these deaths are due to cardiovascular (CV) events1.    
The mechanisms responsible for this limited survival are unclear from the clinical trials 
completed to date.  While persistent valve disease undoubtedly plays a role in a subset of 
patients, particularly in patients with significant aortic regurgitation, t he majority of events are 
due to non -valve related co -morbidities.   
Our multi -disciplinary group includes members with broad expertise in cardiovascular 
and immunologic clinical research.  The over -arching aim of our collaborative work to date is to 
ident ify shared mechanisms of inflammation and thrombosis that correlate with cardiovascular 
disease.   Recent work from our group has focused on the prothrombotic phenotype of activated 
inflammatory monocytes which are preferentially expanded in both HIV and A CS2.   
Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_823883] a 64.3% rate of platelet 
hyporesponsiveness (VerifyNow assay, hyporesponsiveness defined as PRU <208)3.  In this 
post-TAVR population (n=28) the median PRU was 244.5 (interquartile range 164.8 -290.3).  In 
preliminary experiments, we find a profile 
of immune activation after TAVR 
characterized by [CONTACT_823894]14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes, a 
marker we and others have found 
correlates with adverse cardiovascular 
events 2,4.  Of note, we have previously 
demonstrated that inflammatory 
monocytes express high levels of tissue 
factor and this feature also correlates with 
ACS2.  Thus, post -TAVR patients 
represent a patient population in which 
high-potency ADP receptor blockade may 
provide protection against MACE.  
 
Hypothesis  
 Our hypothesis is that TAVR results in at least three simultaneous CV insults : 1) the 
abrupt release of severely elevated left ventricular pressure into a non -compliant systemic 
vasculature leads to generalized endothelial cell activation, 2) the exposure of the pro -
thrombotic and neo -antigenic contents of a degenerated aortic valv e (known to histologically 
resemble atherosclerosis), and 3) the exposure of the replacement valve (bovine valve, 
stainless steel frame, polyester wrap).  We propose that these proximate events lead to platelet 
activation.  Given the important link between  thrombosis and inflammation governed by [CONTACT_206843] -
derived mediators and leukocyte -platelet interactions, we further hypothesize that monocyte 
activation is mediated, at least in part, by [CONTACT_206843] -monocyte interactions, which has been shown 
to induce the ex pansion of inflammatory monocytes5.  Given the pro -thrombotic nature of 
inflammatory monocytes, we suspect a positive feedback loop may exist via the interplay of 
these thrombotic –inflammatory mechanisms, which may be abrogated via high potency  ADP-
receptor blockade (Figure 1 ).  
If our study results indicate an improved thrombotic and immune convalescence with 
Ticagrelor, we would conclude that the mechanism of inflammation after TAVR is mediated in Figure [ADDRESS_1142416] majority of HIV patients, 
who achieve controlled viremia but are left with chronic immune activation and elevated CV 
risk6.      
 
Study Drug Background: Ticagrelor  
FDA Label: https://www.accessdata.fda.g ov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/022433s015lbl.pdf
 Ticagrelor is approved by [CONTACT_823895] (FDA) to 
reduce the rate of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in pateints with acute 
coronary syndrome or a histor y of myocardial infarction. Ticagrelor was studied in the PLATO 
trial which included patients with acute coronary syndrome, randomized to Ticagrelor or 
Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_55834] 12 months.  At 12 months, a  composite of death from vascular causes, 
myocardial infarcti on, or stroke ( the primary endpoint ) had occurred in 9.8% of patients 
receiving ticagrelor as compared with 11.7% of those receiving clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (hazard ratio, 0.84; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.92; P<0.001). No significant difference in the rat es of 
major bleeding was found between the ticagrelor and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_823884] (11.6% and 11.2%, 
respectively; P=0.43), but ticagrelor was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding not 
related to coronary -artery by[CONTACT_15806] (4.5% vs. 3.8%, P=0.03),  including more instances of 
fatal intracranial bleeding and fewer of fatal bleeding of other types.  
 
  
  
4. Study objectives  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been associated with reductions in 
CV morbidity and death in extreme risk/surgery inadvisable patients, but cardiovascular events 
rates remain unacceptably high, with mortality rates of 30% and 50% at [ADDRESS_1142417] ratio of 3.5 for mortality at 30 days9.  Since 45% of cerebral -
vascular accidents (CVA) occur beyond [ADDRESS_1142418] -procedure period may b e a feasible strategy to reduce CVA 
following TAVR.  However, the majority of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
following TAVR remains unexplained and thus, a better understanding of the mediators of CV 
risk is urgently needed in this high risk po pulation. The role of anti -platelet therapy in this patient 
population is also uncertain.  While dual anti -platelet therapy with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_823885] a period of [ADDRESS_1142419] consiste nt 
surrogates of poor long term outcome is clopi[INVESTIGATOR_375096] -responsiveness.  This is typi[INVESTIGATOR_823886] 20 -30% of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and is associated with an 
increased risk of MACE12-15.  Although the prevalence of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_375096] -responsiveness in 
patients with aortic stenosis has not been previously report ed, preliminary data from our group 
indicates a high rate of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_823887] (64.3%) in our post -TAVR population.  
Another marker of poor prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease is elevated 
proportions of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory mon ocytes.  In an unselected cardiac catheterization 
population, elevated CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes were associated with a hazard 
ratio of 3.[ADDRESS_1142420], 
inflammatory response characterized by a marked expansion of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory 
monocytes, evident even within 24 hours of an uncomplicated procedure.    
The central hypothesis of our proposal is that TAVR -induced injury of the 
diseased native aortic valve leads to platelet deposition and inflammatory cell activation 
that can be attenuated by [CONTACT_823896] -platelet and/or pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor.  
We propose a single center, prospective randomized trial to test the following specific  aims:  
1.  To determine whether high -potency ADP receptor blockade reduces measures 
of platelet activation in patients after TAVR.    
2. To determine whether high -potency ADP receptor blockade mitigates the pro -
thrombotic inflammatory response observed after TAVR .   
The co -primary study endpoints will be 1) platelet responsiveness as measured by [CONTACT_823897] (platelet reactivity units, PRU) and 2) the proportion of inflammatory 
monocytes by [CONTACT_823898] 1 day after TAVR.  Secondary endpoints  will 
include other measures of thrombotic and immunologic activation.   
  
5. Study design  
 This is a single center, prospective, randomized, open label trial with blinded endpoint 
evaluation.   
 
5.1 Screening, entry, and randomization:   
 Patients will be screened for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria as part of their pre -
TAVR clinical evaluation  (See Table 1) .  We 
plan to screen 150 patients per year, of whom 
100 are expected to go on to TAVR.  We will 
continue enrollment until 60 patients are 
randomized.  All patients will be required to sign 
informed consent prior to planned TAVR.  The 
scheme for a participa nt’s movement throug h 
the trial is shown in figure 2 .  
 Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 
fashion (n=60) to either continue Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 
(300mg load, 75mg daily) or begin Ticagrelor.  
Patients will receive a 180mg load followed by 
90mg twice daily for on e month.  This will be an 
open label design given the different frequency 
of dosing.  Decisions regarding the 
discontinuance of dual anti -platelet therapy after 
randomization will be at the discretion of the 
treating physician.   
 Patients will be seen at [ADDRESS_1142421] 
TAVR per routine clinical practice.   At this time, 
the final blood draw will be obtained.  The 
occurrence of MACE and bleeding events will be determined by [CONTACT_823899].  Patients will revert to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_823888] -platelet therapy will be left to the discretion of the treating physician.   
 
5.2 Blood Biomarker Procurement :   
 Patients will receive a baseline blood draw prior to TAVR.  Patients will th en have blood 
draws at [ADDRESS_1142422] procedure.  Patients will be seen in followup 
according routine clinical practice at 7 and 30 days.  All blood samples will be obtained using a 
30 mL syringe which is then transferred into tubes con taining 3.2% sodium citrate (blue top) or 
K2-EDTA (purple top).  Aliquots of whole blood will be used for platelet responsiveness studies, 
monocyte flow cytometry, leukocyte -platelet interaction, and T cell activation studies.  Plasma 
and Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be cryopreserved at -80 and -150 degrees, 
respectively.  Plasma based assays will be batched and performed at intervals using freshly 
thawed cryopreserved samples.  
 
5.3 Study Endpoints and Statistical Plan   
 All endpoints will be determined according to an intention to treat analysis.  The primary 
thrombotic endpoint will be platelet responsiveness (PRU) using the VerfiyNow assay at [ADDRESS_1142423] procedure .   Platelet reactivity in the Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123943] T icagrelor groups with be  compared TABLE 1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria:   
1) Valvular heart disease and a clinical indication for 
TAVR,  
2) Age of 18 years or older,  
3) Capable of informed consent.   
4) Planned transfemoral TAVR.  
  
Exclusion criteria:  
1) Prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack 
(TIA), or intracrania l hemorrhage,  
2) Established bleeding diathesis or 
thrombocytopenia (<150k/dl),  
3) End -stage renal disease,  
4) Severe hepatic impairment or liver cirrhosis,  
5) Pregnancy,  
6) Current infection,  
7) History of autoimmune disease,  
8) Established allergy  to contrast agents, 
thienopyridines, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], or ticagrelor,  
9) History of solid organ transplantation,  
10) Atrial Fibrillation, DVT, PE or other indication for 
long term anti -coagulation,  
11) Plan for direct aortic access or trans -api[INVESTIGATOR_823889],

using an independent samples t -test (or non -parametric test 
as appropriate) , with significance declared for p -values 
<0.025.  The primary inflammatory endpoint is the 
percentage of inflammatory monocytes (compa red to total 
monocytes) as a continuous variable [ADDRESS_1142424] (or non -parametric test as 
appropriate) , with signif icance declared for p -values <0.025.  
The percentage of inflammatory monocytes will also be 
compared over multiple time points to determine the 
trajectory and duration of the immune response, to guide 
duration of treatment in future studies.  The values at  
baseline, [ADDRESS_1142425].  Models that 
include the 30 -day values also wi ll be fit.  Time period will 
be considered both as a continuous covariate (in days), as 
well as a categorical variable.  Inferential interest will focus 
on treatment by [CONTACT_6491].  These models will also be 
used to explore the relationship between t he level of P2Y12 
inhibition and the reduction in inflammatory monocytes 
between treatments. This relationship  could be different 
given that T icagrelor is not only a more potent P2Y12 
antagonist as compared with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_823890]  
a unique dual mode of action; P2Y12 antagonism complemented with adenosine uptake 
inhibition.  
 Secondary measures of thrombotic and immune status will be crucial for the 
determination of mechanism and to guide future studies.  These will include: platelet -leukocyte 
aggregates, platelet P -selectin and activated GPI[INVESTIGATOR_97086]/IIIa expression, markers of T -cell activation 
(i.e., HLA -DR/CD38 co -expression), and plasma markers of inflammation (CRP, IL -6, TNF -a, IL-
6, sCD14, CD40L, oxidized LDL) and thrombosis (thrombin -antithrombin complexes, F1.2, 
soluble P -selectin, S100A8/A9, D -dimers).  These secondary measures will be analyzed as 
continuous variables at baseline, [ADDRESS_1142426]+/CD38+ CD4 and CD8 T -cells.  These values at the specified time points will also be 
compared within group using longitudinal mixed models to determine their kinetics and between 
groups to establish whether a treatment by t ime interactions exists.   
 
5.4 Time point/frame of measurement for primary variable(s)  
The primary endpoints will be assessed 1 day after study drug initiation and TAVR.  
Measurements taken at 7 and 30 days after TAVR will be considered secondary/explorato ry.

5.5.b P2Y12 Platelet Reactivity : Platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) will be 
measured as platelet reactivity units (PRU) using the VerifyNow assay (Accriva Diagnostics, 
San Diego, [LOCATION_004]) using whole blood collected in a device - compatible citrated tube.   
 
5.5.c Whole Blood Flow Cytometric Analysis of Patient Samples : 
 Blood samples will be l ysed using BD FACS lysing solution (BD, Franklin L akes, NJ), washed, 
and stained as Table 2.  Compensation will be  performed using standard compensation beads 
(BD Biosciences) and appropriate isotype control antibodies.  Flow cytometry will be performed 
using a  MACSQUANT analyzer.  Monocyte phenotypes (classical, non -classical inflammatory 
CD14+CD16+, 
non-classi cal 
patrolling 
CD14lowCD16++) 
will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_823901]14 
and CD16 as we 
have previously 
described16. 
Specifically, the % 
inflammatory 
monocytes is the 
proportion of 
inflammatory 
monocyte to the 
sum of classical, inflammatory and patrolling monocytes.  The definition of CD16 positive versus 
negative gating will be based upon a pan -isotype panel.  Final values for % inflammatory 
monocytes will be the mean of the duplicates obtained using panel A and panel B.  Monocyte -
CD62P+ platelet aggregation will be a nalyzed  as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)  of P-
selection (Monocyte P anel A) and Monocyte - GP IIb/IIIa+ platelet aggregation will be analyzed 
as the percentage of monocytes which exhibit positive staining for activated IIb/IIIa (PAC -1 
antibody - Monoc yte P anel B) , with total monocytes as the denominator . 
 
5.5.d Blood Collection and Isolation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Plasma : 30 mL 
blood was collected in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; BD Vacutainer, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ) and 2 mL in tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate (BD Vacutainer, Franklin 
Lakes, NJ). Samples were then maintained at room temperature until processing. Plasma was 
isolated from the EDTA blood through centrifugation and preserved at -80 degrees Celsius.   
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by [CONTACT_138789] -Paque Plus (Sigma, St. 
Louis, MO) density gradient centrifugation, washed, re -suspended in 90% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS; Gemini, West Sacramento, CA) and 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMS O; Sigma, St. Louis, 
MO), and cryopreserved at -150 degrees F.  
5.5.e Plasma Cytokine and Immune Biomarkers : Plasma based assays are done using 
commercially available ELISA and  cytokine bead array technology  (BD Biosciences) .

Our power calculation is based upon the inflammatory co -primary endpoint, using our 
preliminary data.  In preliminary studies of 25 patients undergoing TAVR, the mean proportion of 
inflammatory monocyt es 1 days after TAVR was 20.0%  with a standard deviation of 5.0 %.  
Thus, a total of 60 patients, randomized 30:[ADDRESS_1142429] 80% power to detect 
an absolute effect of 4% (i.e. ticagrelor treated patients having 16 % percent inflammatory 
monocytes), using a two sided t -test with Type I error of 0.025.  Note that we are using 
Bonferonni correction, to account for two primary outcomes.  We expect dropout of randomized 
patients to be less than 10% prior to the 1 day blood draw.  All randomized patients will be 
analyzed using an intention to treat analysis.  We will assess the missing completely at random 
assumption by [CONTACT_823902] (MAR), and use of multiple imputation approaches.

5.8 Treatment assignment  
Random ization will be performed vi a seal envelop system . Opaque envelopes (60) will be filled 
with a sheet of paper in which Ticagrelor (30) or Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (30) is written and envelops are to 
be opened after informed consent is received and on or before the start of the TAVR such that 
study drug initiation occurs  prior to TAVR.  Randomization envelops are stored securely at the 
Clinical trials office at  University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (UH) .  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1142431] label. Receipt, distribution, return, and destruction (if any) of  study medications will be 
properly documented.  
 
5.11 Prior and concomitant therapy  
All ongoing medications at screening and used during the study (prescription and over -the 
counter),  including adjunct therapy or medical devices, will be recorded in the appropriate  
section of the eCRF throughout the study. Use of ASA and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_823891] P2Y12  
inhibitor prior and during TAVR procedu re should also be recorded.  It is advised that the 
appropriate local and national guideline recommendations are followed  for any concomitant 
medications.  Concomitant medication will be evaluated when considering AE causal 
relationship .

Specific Aims  
In this study, a 2 -group randomized design will be used to evaluate changes in biomarkers 
associated with the use of e -cigarettes with and without nicotine among African American menthol 
and nonmenthol cigarette smokers. 240 smokers (all African American) will be randomized into one of 
two study groups including 1) Active e -cigarettes (containing nicotine), or 2) nicotine -free e -cigarette 
(containing 0mg nicotine). Within each study condition, participants will be allowed to select their 
preferred flavor (m enthol or non -menthol) of electronic cigarettes after sampling both flavors. ) 
Blocked randomization will be performed to ensure balance in the number of intervention assignments 
between the study groups (i.e., active e -cigarette versus nicotine -free e -cigarette). The power 
calculation for this study is based a two -sided two -sample equal -variance t -test on the primary 
outcome of NNAL (pmol/mg creatinine) at week 6 (active e -cig group vs. control e -cig group), and 
assumes an alpha of 0.05, and an NNAL standa rd deviation of 0.80. With a sample size of [ADDRESS_306594] 80% power to detect a difference in NNAL between the active and 
placebo e -cig groups of at least 0.[ADDRESS_306595] deviations at week 6 (mean difference of 0.32 pmol/mg 
creatinine) .  
All participants will be provided with e -cigarettes for ad lib  use based upon the study 
randomization assignment. Follow -up assessments will be conducted at  2, 6, and [ADDRESS_306596] 
randomization. Primary outcome s will be changes in biomarkers , including  total nicotine exposure 
(TNE)  and 4-(methylnitrosamino) -1-(3-pyridyl) -1-butanol (NNAL) .  Secondary outcomes will be the 
patterns of use of combustible cigarettes and electronic cigarettes including dual use.  
Primary Aim:  To compare  the effect of electron ic cigarettes  with nicotine to electronic 
cigarettes without nicotine on NNAL (a biomarker  related to the use of combustible cigarettes) among  
African American menthol and non -menthol smokers . 
Primary Hypothesis:   At [ADDRESS_306597] -enrollment, t here will be a greater reduction in NNAL 
among  participants using electronic cigarettes with nicotine compared to participants using electronic 
cigarettes without nicotine.  
Secondary Aim : To compare  the effect of electronic cigarettes  with nicotine to electronic 
cigarettes without nicotine on smoking behavior (combustible cigarettes) among  African American 
menthol and non -menthol smokers . 
Secondary Hypothesis:   At [ADDRESS_306598] -enrollment, t here will be a greater reduction in use of 
com bustible cigarettes among  participants using electronic cigarettes with nicotine compared to 
participants using electronic cigarettes without nicotine.  
 
Significance  
Approximately 1 in 4 adult smokers in the U.S. smoke mentholated cigarettes.1 However, there 
is substantial variation in the use of mentholated cigarettes.1  Up to 80% of African American smokers 
use mentholated cigarettes compared to approximately 25% of non -Hispanic white smokers.[ADDRESS_306599] e -Cig Study - 1509M78241  
Protocol Version 5_9/8/[ADDRESS_306600] found this association.9, 10 The pattern of use of mentholated cigarettes 
in Minnesota is consistent with national data in that 22% of smokers used mentholated cigarettes in 
[ADDRESS_306601] the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco pro ducts. In July 2011, 
the FDA’s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) submitted its final report with a 
recommendation that “removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public 
health in the U.S.”. Although the FDA has y et to issue its final decision on the TPSAC report, one 
possible action could be a ban of mentholated cigarettes by [CONTACT_252299] U.S. markets. A number of 
studies have examined what might happen if menthol cigarettes were to be banned from the U.S. 
markets . In a recent survey, [ADDRESS_306602] if menthol cigarettes were banned.11 Thirty -five percent of menthol smokers said 
they would quit smoking if menthol cigarettes were banned w hile 25% said they would “find a way to 
buy a menthol brand”. In another study, researchers used data from the [ADDRESS_306603] on 
smoking prevalence and smoking at tributable deaths.12 Results showed that in a scenario in which 30% 
of menthol smokers quit and 30% of those who would have initiated as menthol smokers do not 
initiate, the relative reduction in smoking prevalence would be 9.7% overall and 24.8% for black s by 
2050. These studies suggest that a ban on menthol cigarettes could result in [ADDRESS_306604] been doubling annually and are projected to surpass the $[ADDRESS_306605] recent data from a representative national sample of adults 
reported that 4.2% of adults used e -cigarettes everyday, some days or rarely.[ADDRESS_306606] e -Cig Study - 1509M78241  
Protocol Version 5_9/8/2017  
 disproportionate bur den of tobacco -related health effects. The proposed study is therefore designed 
to determine the biomarkers associated with the use of e -cigarettes with and without nicotine by 
[CONTACT_252300]; and to determine the patterns of use of electronic c igarettes among 
African American smokers. This study has high potential to contribute significant new knowledge that 
could be invaluable for reducing the burden of tobacco -related health problems in Minnesota and 
beyond.  
Furthermore, the distributors of e -cigarettes promote them as free of harmful substances 
claiming that e -cigarettes do not deliver toxic doses of nicotine.13, [ADDRESS_306607] preferences of menthol cigarette smokers (n=53) 
when they were asked to stop smoking. Menthol smokers tested a number of products including 
nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (regular and mint -flavored nico tine gum) and electronic cigarettes 
(menthol and non -menthol brands) and ranked their product preferences. Menthol smokers 
overwhelmingly (75%) selected menthol e -cigarettes to help them during a cigarette abstinence phase. 
The proposed study builds on fin dings from our prior work by [CONTACT_252301] e -
cigarettes.  
Although the role of electronic cigarettes in tobacco control is controversial,21, 22 there is 
paucity of data to inform the debate.  Limited available data show that e -cigarettes are used by 
[CONTACT_252302].23  In a 4 -country survey24 that included the [LOCATION_003], Canada, U.K. 
and Australia, respondents reported usin g e-cigarettes for a variety of reasons including in smoke free 
zones (85%), for reducing smoking (80%), because it is perceived to be less harmful (75%), or to quit 
smoking (70%).  Other studies suggest that e -cigarettes are capable of delivering nicotine  into the 
bloodstream and reducing withdrawal as effectively as NRTs.25, [ADDRESS_306608] 20% -25% of African American smokers and 75% -
 
ClearWay e -Cig Study - 1509M78241  
Protocol Version 5_9/8/2017  
 80% of w hite smokers smoke non -mentholated cigarettes.[ADDRESS_306609] shown slightly better 
outcomes for AA menthol compared to nonmenthol smokers.5-7 Studying AA menthol and nonmenthol 
smokers in the same study would provide the opportunity to evaluate potent ial differences in 
outcomes by [CONTACT_252303] e -cigarettes and biomarkers of exposure to e -
cigarettes. The primary aim of the current application is to determine the biomarkers associated with 
the use of electronic cigarettes among  African American menthol and nonmenthol smokers.. The study 
will also assess differences in patterns of use of e -cigarettes between African American menthol and 
nonmenthol smokers and e -cigarettes with and without nicotine.  
Unfortunately, clinical studie s assessing the efficacy of e -cigarette for smoking cessation per se 
cannot begin without an Investigational New Drug (IND) for a chosen e -cigarette from the FDA;[ADDRESS_306610] -funded pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n=53) to determine 
cessation treatment preferences of menthol cigarette smokers in which menthol smokers tested six 
products including four types of nicotine gum ( 2mg & 4mg plain;  2mg & 4mg mint -flavored) and two 
flavors of electronic cigarettes (16mg menthol and non -menthol). Study enrollment was completed in 
about six weeks. Participants were all African American menthol smokers, 53% male, mean age 45.5 
(SD=11.5)  years, smoked 14.2 CPD at baseline (SD=5.1).  
  Of the [ADDRESS_306611] selection phase, 73.5% selected menthol e -
cigarettes, 18.9% selected non -menthol e -cigarettes, and 7.5 % selected 2mg mint nicotine gum for 
smoking cessation. At the fi nal week six follow -up visit (after two weeks of using selected product), 
 
ClearWay e -Cig Study - 1509M78241  
Protocol Version 5_9/8/2017  
 participants on average smoked 4.5 CPD; they reported using 8.7 e -cigarettes total for the 2 -week 
cessation phase (<1 e -cig/day); and four participants had quit smoking tobacco cigar ettes.  
  Findings from our formative research informed the proposed study in a number of ways 
including, 1) the formative research showed that African American menthol smokers will engage in a 
clinical research that includes the use of e -cigarettes. Given that recruitment of the 50 participants was 
completed in less than two months with minimal attrition, established the feasibility of recruitment for 
the proposed study; 2) African American menthol smokers overwhelmingly preferred menthol e -
cigarettes compa red to other tested products as a smoking cessation aid. This finding informed our 
choice of menthol e -cigarettes for the proposed study; and 3) given the absence of data on the 
patterns of use of e -cigarettes and the impact of use on biomarker of exposure , a natural step is for a 
study to evaluate the effects of e -cigarette on smoking behavior in this population  
 
 
Innovation  
 
The proposed study is innovative in that it will be the first to determine the biomarkers 
associated with the use of e -cigarettes am ong African American menthol and nonmenthol smokers, 
and to determine the pattern e -cigarette use among this priority population. In addition, this study will 
examine the role of nicotine in pattern of e -cigarette use and biomarkers of exposure.  
Both nati onally and in Minnesota, racial/ethnic minorities as well as other at risk groups (e.g. 
youth, low SES) smoke menthol cigarettes at disproportionately high rates compared to the general 
population. These groups also experience disproportionately higher rat es of tobacco -related socio -
economic and health consequences compared to the general population. The proposed research will 
examine patterns of use of e -cigarettes among smokers of combustible cigarettes in this priority 
population of smokers and the impac t of these behaviors on biomarkers of exposure. Such information 
is critical to addressing use of tobacco products among at -risk smokers in Minnesota and nationally.  
 
Approach  
 
A total of 240 (all African American smokers) will be randomized  1:1 into one of two groups: 
nicotine -containing electronic cigarettes or nicotine -free electronic cigarettes.  All participants will be 
provided with e -cigarettes by [CONTACT_1758], based upon the study randomization assignment and be 
asked to use ad lib. Follow -up assessmen ts will be conducted at  2, 6, and [ADDRESS_306612] 
randomization. Primary outcome s will be assessment of urinary biochemical markers NNAL (tobacco -
specific carcinogen) and total nicotine exposure  (not specific to tobacco)  (TNE). Secondary outcomes 
will be the  patterns of use of combustible cigarettes and e-cigarette s. 
Inclusion criteria:  1) self -identify as African American or Black; 2) age 18 years or older; 3) 
smoke at least five cigarettes daily for the past year; 4) Willing to use e -cigarettes;  5) Good ph ysical 
 
ClearWay e -Cig Study - 1509M78241  
Protocol Version 5_9/8/2017  
 health (no unstable medical or mental health condition); 6) no contraindications for e -cigarette use ; 
and 7) does not have a set quit -date in the next 30 days.  
         Exclusion criteria : 1) Recent unstable or untreated psychiatric diagnosis includ ing substance 
abuse, as determined by [CONTACT_9288] -IV criteria; 2) use in the past 30 days of e -cigarettes ;  3) pregnant or 
nursing.  
Recruitment : will utilize methods we have successfully used in previous studies with African 
American smokers33-[ADDRESS_306613] the study coordinator if they are interested in participating.  
Randomizati on Scheme:  Randomization will occur at the individual level at the baseline 
assessment. The study statistician will provide the study coordinator with group assignments in sealed 
envelopes that will only be opened after  study staff have  confirm ed eligibili ty and comple ted final 
consent. To ensure balance in the number of intervention assignments between the study groups (i.e., 
active e -cigarette versus nicotine -free e -cigarette ),blocked randomization will be performed and the 
size and sequence of  which will only be known to the statistician.  
 
Study Procedures  
Baseline/Randomization visit : At this visit the study’s goal and procedures as well as participant 
responsibilities will be reviewed with each participant. Those who are interested will sign a consent 
form and be asked to  complete an expi[INVESTIGATOR_252288]. If 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_252289] <8ppm, then a urine sample will be collected and tested with urine strips 
for the presence of cotinine. If expi[INVESTIGATOR_252289] <8ppm and cotinine is not detected in the 
urine, the participant will be ineligible.  Eligible participants will  complete baseline assessments 
including demographics, tobacco use, and nicotine dependence measures. Participants will then be 
rand omized to receive either active e -cigarettes (containing nicotine), or nicotine -free e -cigarette 
(containing 0mg nicotine). Within each study condition, participants will be allowed to select their 
preferred flavor (menthol or non -menthol) of electronic ci garettes. Prior to selection of their preferred 
flavor, participants will be allowed to sample both menthol and non -menthol flavored brands of e -
cigarettes by [CONTACT_41680] a few puffs from both brands during the visit. Participants will receive enough 
supply of study products to last until their next appointment plus [ADDRESS_306614] e -Cig Study - 1509M78241  
Protocol Version 5_9/8/2017  
 Weeks 2 and 6 : Approximately three days before each of these visits, participants will be 
contact[CONTACT_252304] c ard and by [CONTACT_648]. At these visits participants will update 
their contact [CONTACT_252305] a brief survey (combustible cigarettes and e -cigarettes use, 
withdrawal symptoms, etc), take expi[INVESTIGATOR_252290], and receive more e -cigarettes  (week 2 only)  to last 
until  their week [ADDRESS_306615] if participant has been actively using their e -
cigarettes and count returned e -cigarettes. Urine will also be collected at week  6 to assess NNAL and 
TNE.  
         Week 12: Participants will complete a survey over the phone . 
         Compensation :  Participants will be compensated for their time and transportation to minimize 
attrition. Based on our experiences in previous studies participants will receive $40 at baseline  and 
week 2,  $50 at we ek 6 visit, and  $20 at week 12, for a maximum of $150  per participant over 12 weeks . 
Nicotine E-Cigarette Arm : Participants will receive an active (brand and dose TBD) e -cigarette  
with the flavor of their choice.  Participants will each be dispensed a free rechargeable e -cigarette 
starter kit with the necessary accessories at the randomization visit plus enough supplies at this visit 
and the week 2 visit  for a total supply of 6 weeks. Trouble shooting support will be provided as well as 
phone numbers for both technical and medical assistance related to the use of e -cigarettes. Follow -up 
visit schedule and all other study protocol for participants in each arm will be the same. Although the 
study will only provide par ticipants with e -cigarettes for 6 weeks, they will be told that they are 
allowed to purchase their own if needed after 6 weeks.  
   Nicotine -free E-cigarette arm:   Participants will receive e -cigarettes containing 0mg nicotine 
with the same protocol describ ed for the active e -cigarette arm above.  
  
Human Subjects Protection:  
This study will enroll [ADDRESS_306616] 
been discussed earlier in the proposal. Before any research is conducted, we will obtain I RB approval 
for the study protocol and informed consent documents. Data will be obtained exclusively for research 
purposes.  
Potential Risks:   The use of the e -cigarettes will be under supervision of [CONTACT_98702] . The e -
cigarettes will be discontinued in pati ents who become pregnant or develop a contraindication. 
Patients will be told that e -cigarettes are not approved by [CONTACT_193478] a smoking cessation aid. Some 
studies have found that the levels of the toxicants in e -cigarettes are [ADDRESS_306617] data, there are some studies showing more i mmediate effects from e -cigarette use, 
e.g. decreased Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO), increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_252291],[ADDRESS_306618] for 1 minute was associated with decrease in  a person’s tear film stability, 
increase in ocular and throat symptoms, and slight reduction in forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] [ADDRESS_306619] e -Cig Study - 1509M78241

Data Collection (Measures):  
Due to the literacy level of the target population, if needed all questionnaire items will be read 
to, or along with participants, by a trained research assistant.[ADDRESS_306621] and other studies with African A merican smokers.  
 
Outcomes  
   Cigarette Smoking Behavior.  Use of combustible cigarettes will be characterized in a variety of 
ways.  These include, for example, smoking status; number of cigarettes smoked per day, per week, 
and per month; smoking history (age when first smoked); quitting history; and cigarette brand smoked 
(menthol vs. nonmenthol). These questions have established validity and reliability, and have been 
used in a sample comparable to the one planned for the current study.5, 7 Use of e -cigarettes will be 
assessed at baseline  and weeks 2, 6, and 12 using one item from the Penn State  Electronic Cigarette 
Dependence Index42 which asks the participant, “How many times per day do you usually use your 
electronic cigarette?” (assume that one “time ” consists of around 15 puffs or lasts around 10 minutes); 
scoring: 0 -4 times/day = 0, 5 -9 = 1, 10 -14 = 2, 15 -19 = 3, 20 -29 = 4, 30+ = 5). Total NNAL can be used to 
validate the use of only e -cigarettes because NNK is not present in the fluids used in e -cigarettes but is 
present in tobacco products.   We will calculate total NNAL/total cotinine ratio.  If no other tobacco is 
used, then the ratio should be low. [CONTACT_84472] has extensive experience in the use of NNAL to 
validate tobacco use status.  
Demograp hics: The demographic data that will be collected in the study includes housing, 
gender, education, marital status, age, income, and employment status.  
Nicotine Dependence : We will assess using the [ADDRESS_306622] for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) to assess dependence to combustible 
cigarettes.43 Dependence on e -cigarettes will be assessed at weeks  2, 6, and 12  using the 10 -item Penn 
State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index.42 This scale has been valida ted with a large sample of ex -
smokers and e -cigarette users.  
Withdrawal Symptoms : We will use the modified scale developed by [CONTACT_252306].44 
Items in the scale include desire to smoke, irritability (anger, frustration), anxiety (nervousness), 
difficulty concentrating, restlessness (impatience), hunger, depression, and awakening. Responses will 
be summed to create a withdrawal severity index and used as covariates in our analyses.  
Readiness to quit :  We will use the [ADDRESS_306623] e -Cig Study - 1509M78241  
Protocol Version 5_9/8/2017  
 Other substance abuse : Questions to assess alcohol and other substances will be derived from 
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.47 These measures will be used as moderators  of 
intervention components.  
 
Biomarker assessment : The primary biomarkers that will be evaluated include urinary total 
NNAL and total nicotine equivalent (TNE).  The urinary biomarkers will be assessed at baseline  and 
week 6 . We will also assess expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] c arbon monoxide (CO) using a hand held, portable CO monitor 
(Bedfont Micro Smokerlyzer, Kent, England).  We will use 8 ppm as the cut -off to verify smoking status 
as recommended by [CONTACT_252307].48 Our group has extensive  
experience with biochemical verification of smoking.7, 33, 35, 49 Expi[INVESTIGATOR_252292] -
person visits. If expi[INVESTIGATOR_133268] <8ppm, a urine test strip will be used to detect the presence of 
nicotine/cotinine. We will also calculate total NNAL/t otal cotinine ratio. The TNE and NNAL analysis will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_60147]. Sharon Murphy at the University of Minnesota.

Rationale for Study Design  
1)          Overall design: The current study design was informed by [CONTACT_252308] e -
cigarette for smoking cessation. Using a randomized design would reduce potential differences in 
smoking behavior (e.g. CPD, m otivation and confidence to quit, quit attempts, psychosocial factors, 
etc) between study groups that might impact the outcomes of interest. A [ADDRESS_306625] of use on bi omarkers of 
exposure.  
  
2)         How was the brand and dose of e -cigarette selected? In our recently completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_252294], we used the Blu e -cigarette (approximately 13 -16mg nicotine) which is among the most 
commonly used and widely available e -cigarett es. The product was well -liked and well -tolerated by 
[CONTACT_4317]. However, there are more recent generations of e -cigarettes that may deliver a higher 
amount of nicotine. Therefore, if this proposal is funded, we will review all available options in the 
market and consider factors such amount of nicotine delivered, price, and affiliation of manufacturer 
with tobacco industry in final product selection with guidance from [CONTACT_84472], an e -cigarette 
expert on our team.  
 
3)         Why limit study sample to  African Americans? There are well -documented differences in  
smoking patterns and nicotine metabolism between African Americans (AAs) and whites. These include 
the fact that AAs smoke fewer cigarettes per day and predominantly smoke menthol cigarettes.[ADDRESS_306626] higher cotinine levels per cigarette smoked than whites.30 Differences in smoking patterns 
and nicotine metabolism in specific populations could introduce variability that masks potential 
differences in how smokers use e -cigarettes effects. Also, in the TPSAC report to the FDA, the 
population that had lower success rates for smoking cessation among menthol smokers compared to 
non-menthol smokers was predominantly African American 
(http://www.fda.g ov/downloads/ AdvisoryCommittees/ 
CommitteesMeetingMaterials/TobaccoProductsScientificAdvisoryCommittee/UCM269697.pdf).

Power Calculation  
The power calculation for this study is based a two -sided two -sample equal -variance t -test on 
the primary outcome of NNAL (pmol/mg creatinine) at week 6 (active e -cig group vs. control e -cig 
group), and assumes an alpha of 0.05, and an NNAL standard deviat ion of 0.80.[ADDRESS_306629] 80% power to detect a difference in NNAL between the active and 
placebo e -cig groups of at least 0.[ADDRESS_306630] deviations at week 6 (mean difference of 0.32 pmol/mg 
creatinine). This is appropriate given a prior study with similar methods saw a decrease in NNAL of 
approximately 0.3 pmol/mg from baseline to week 6 among smokers that switched to reduced nicotine 
cigarettes (CENIC, n=196, p=0.02).51 
For example, if the control e -cig group  has no reduction in NNAL from baseline to week 6 (i.e. 
1.50 to 1.50 pmol/mg creatinine), this study will be powered to detect a difference between study 
groups with at least a 21% reduction in NNAL in the active e -cig group (i.e. 1.50 to 1.18 pmol/mg 
crea tinine). When comparing expected NNAL at week 6 between the two groups (active: 1.18 vs. 
control: 1.50 pmol/mg creatinine), the NNAL ratio is 0.79. This is comparable to the results in CENIC, 
which found a statistical ly significant NNAL ratio of 0.78 compa ring participants that used 15mg/g 
cigarettes vs. participants that used reduced nicotine cigarettes (0.4mg/g) at week 6 (CENIC, n=196, 
p=0.02; Donny et al. 2015). To ensure that we have 200 participants complete the week 6 visit, we will 
inflate the rando mization number by 20% , to 240 randomized, or 120 per group . This power 
calculation was completed using SAS Software v.9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

demographic  variables  and baseline characteristics (i.e. age, gender, cigarettes smoked per day, 
nicotine dependence, and menthol vs. regular cigarette smoker) . These analyses , along with a priori 
reasoning  will help determine whether there is a need to incorporate covariates into later analyses.  
Primary analyses: The primary outcome for the study will be NNAL  at week [ADDRESS_306632]  change in NNAL from baseline to week 6, paired t -tests 
will be used within randomization group.   
Secondary analys es: Differences in our secondary measures between the two study groups will

linear reg ression for continuous outcomes;  using their Generalized Estimating Equations or mixed 
model analogs when the outcomes were repeate dly measured within person). Specifically, differences 
in smoking behavior bet ween the two groups will be assessed by [CONTACT_252309] 7 days preceding the baseline visit to each study time point (week 
2, week 6, and week 12). Other secondary measures that will be compared between t he two groups 
may include: change in TNE from baseline to follow up visits, e -cigarette use from baseline to week 6, 
e-cigarette use from week [ADDRESS_306633] evaluation.  
         Data Management: Data management activities for this project will encompass data entry, data 
cleaning, identifying and tagging any crossovers, conversion into proper format for data analysis and 
recoding. REDCap will be used for designing, implementation and maintenance of the database. In 
addition, a comput er based tracking system will be developed to follow each patient and to prompt 
the staff for the upcoming data collection point. Data collection points for each subject will be 
calculated from his or her initial date of contact. Data entry will be perform ed at the University of 
Minnesota. Codebooks will be developed and will include variable formats (numeric/alpha), min/max 
ranges and any skip patterns.

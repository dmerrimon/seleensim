 1. OBJE CTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objectives  
• Phase I  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of IFN-γ with 
paclitaxel , trastuzumab and pertuzumab  for 12 weeks  and determine the 
recommended  phase II dose  (RP2D) in patients  with metastatic breast  cancer  
• Phase II  
To evaluate the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) after combination of  
IFN-γ with paclitaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab  for 12 weeks of neoadjuvant 
therapy in  patients with clinical stage 1-3(primary tumor size ≥10mm)) HER2 
positive breast cancer  
 
  1.2 Secondary Objectives:  
• Phase I  
To evaluate overall response rate (OR, CR+PR)  using standard response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 
To evaluate median progression free survival (PFS) 
• Phase II  
To evaluate safety and tolerability of the combination therapy  
To evaluate the PFS  
 
  1.3    Exploratory Objectives: 
                  (A) Determine whether IFN -γ combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_479540]- HER -2 CD4 Th1                  
response,  
(B) Change the tumor associated immune response, or  
(C) Change  the known tumor biomarkers that predict response in the HER -[ADDRESS_615724] cancer (1). This comes with 
considerable cost burdens to all nations, not to mention associated morbidities to individual breast cancer survivors. Patients with HER-2- expressing (HER -2
pos) breast cancer have 
significant risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_479541] (2, 3).  HER-[ADDRESS_615725] improved survival in many patients (4 -6) but resistance often develops, resulting in relapse. There are also 
increased central nervous system failures (7). Additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_479542] -[ADDRESS_615726] this disease in the category of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, anal carcinoma, and testicular cancer; diseases once causing significant mortalities that today are 
A Phase I -II Study of Interferon -gamma Plus Weekly Paclitaxel , Trastuzumab and 
Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615727] made a series of observations that support the hypothesis that 
restoring a deficit in Th1 immunity will render HER -2 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_479543], increase 
pathologic complete responses (pCR), and reduce mortality in patients with HER -2pos breast 
cancer.  
 
2.2 Preclinical data   
 
Evidence for Loss of anti -HER -2 Th1 Response during Tumorigenesis: We have made the 
observation that healthy adult women possess unusually high, pre- existing Th1 immunity against 
HER -[ADDRESS_615728] during HER-2pos 
tumorigenesis (8). This deficit is first detectable at the ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) stage, and 
becomes profoundly suppressed in early invasion, even by [CONTACT_64367] I ( Fig 1 ). There is no such loss 
of HER -[ADDRESS_615729] other (non-tumor) control antigens, suggesting this suppression is antigen -selective and not a product of global anergy ( Fig 1 ).  Standard therapy of surgery, 
radiation, and chemotherapy with trastuzumab does not routinely correct this anti- HER -2 Th1 
loss, but vaccination with HER-2- pulsed type I dendritic cells (DC1) can dramatically increase 
peripheral anti -HER -2-CD4 Th1, suggesting this is not a fixed deficit, but instead one that can be 
corrected by [CONTACT_479558] (8).   
 
The anti -HER -2 Th1 Response Correlates with Clinical Outcomes : HER -[ADDRESS_615730] cancer 
patients achieving a pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate improved survival while those with residual disease at the time of surgery demonstrate increased risk of recurrence (9). Although as a group, invasive HER-[ADDRESS_615731] cancer patients show depressed anti -HER -2 Th1 
immunity, some individuals are profoundly suppressed while others retain moderate responsiveness. Those patients that regain or partially retain anti- HER -2 Th1 demonstrate higher 
pCR rates to neoadjuvant chemo/trastuzumab therapy, while those with residual disease display the lowest anti- HER -2 CD4 Th1 responses ( Fig 2A ). Shown is the loss of repertoire but there is 
also significant difference in overall and cumulative responses (9). The anti- HER -2 CD4 
immune response represents an increase interferon gamma (IFN -γ) production in the Tbet
pos Th1 
population and not GATA 3pos Th2 population ( Fig 2B ), suggesting the Th1 immune response 
may be critical to mediating anti- HER -[ADDRESS_615732] 
elevated immune gene expression in the tumor is associated with improved outcomes (10) . We 
have also investigated the relationship between anti -HER -[ADDRESS_615733] diminished anti- HER -2 Th1 immune responses show decreased disease free 
survival (DFS) ( Fig 2C ) while those with retained anti- HER -[ADDRESS_615734] substantially 
greater DFS ( Fig 2C ) (11).  This deficit of anti- HER -[ADDRESS_615735] submitted a preliminary manuscript demonstrating anti -HER -2 CD4 Th1 response has 98% accuracy rate in predicting pCR to 
neoadjuvant therapy.   
Correcting the Anti -HER -[ADDRESS_615736] Cancer: We and others have shown that there is a significant loss of MHC class I 
expression with increasing HER-2 expression (12). Hence CD8 T cells do not readily recognize 
these tumor cells.  Interestingly the MHC class I peptide HER -2 vaccine Neuvax (E75) had i ts 
greatest activity in low HER -2 1+ and [ADDRESS_615737] cells vs HER-2 high and intermediate cells with low Class I expression (12, 13).  However, IFN- γ and TNF- α treatment 
of HER -[ADDRESS_615738] cancer cells increases MHC class I expression and also enhances 
CD8 T cell recognition (12).  Hence, as we have shown ex vivo  that correction of the anti- HER -2 
CD4 Th1 response is critical to allowing anti-HER -2 CD8 T cells to recognize and kill, or 
release cytokines in HER -2 intermediate and high expressing cells (HER -2 2+ and HER-2 3+). 
Restoring this anti- HER -2 CD4 Th1 response or providing Th1 cytokines may be critical for 
effective CD8 T cell activ ity, which has been shown to be critical for response to HER- 2 targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], chemotherapy and radiation (14- 16). With the increase in MHC class I caused by [CONTACT_20129] -
γ is a simultaneous increase in PD1L on the breast cancer cells, which may afford the 
opportunity to add checkpoint inhibitors to therapy when restoring anti- HER -2 CD4 Th1 (12).  
 
Th1 Cytokines Cause Induction of Tumor Senescence and Apoptosis in HER -[ADDRESS_615739] Cancer: Since there is a specific loss of anti- HER -[ADDRESS_615740] cancer cells expressing HER -2 (Fig 3 ) as measure by β gal or p15 expression. There is a dose dependent 
increase in tumor senescence  with these cytokines ( Fig 3C ), as well as a sensitivity of HER -2 
expressing cells, with high HER-2 expressing cells being more sensitive to lower concentrations 
of Th1 cytokines than intermediate expressing cells ( Fig 3 D ). These two cytokines work in 
concert and only impact HER- [ADDRESS_615741] cancer (TNBC) ( Fig 3D ). More recently, we have investigated the use of 
combination therapy against HER-2 using trastuzumab and pertuzumab with Th1 cytokines IFN-
γ and TNF- α (Fig 4 ), and noted a synergistic effect on the induction of apoptosis and tumor 
senescence in HER -[ADDRESS_615742] cancer cells ( Fig 5 ). In addition, in HER -[ADDRESS_615743] 
become resistant to trastuzumab, IFN-γ and trastuzumab and pertuzumab dramatically induce tumor senescence ( Fig 5) .  Shown is an example of the HCC [ADDRESS_615744] 
similar effects.   
Pre-clinical Data: IFN -γ synergizes with Taxanes and anti- HER -2 Blockade :  Mark Green’s 
group at University of Pennsylvania has documented that combining IFN- γ, HER -[ADDRESS_615745] 
cancers ( Fig 6 ) (17).  We propose that combinations of systemic IFN- γ combined with 
trastuzumab and pertuzumab, alone and in combination with single agent taxanes, will enhance  
sensitivity of HER -[ADDRESS_615746] no g ood alternatives except salvage 
palliative chemotherapy . If IFN -γ in combination with taxanes with trastuzumab  and pertuzumab 
is well tolerated in phase 1 clinical trial, a subsequent phase 2 neoadjuvant study of this 
combination will be conducted to assess the efficacy and safety .

2.4 Agents under Investigation  
2.4.1 Interferon -gamma 1b (IFN -γ 1b, Actimmune
®) 
IFN-γ is a cytokine and is the only type II interferon.  It is naturally produced mainly by [CONTACT_479562] T -lymphocytes and works as an immunomodulator in various capacities.  In its 
role as an immunomodulator it is 100-10,000 times more potent than the type I interferons.  IFN-
γ has many functions physiologically, including but not limited to regulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, activating the differentiation and function of phagocytes, augments interactions between macr ophages and T- cells, and plays a key role in 
regulating T -cell subsets to determine the type of immune effector function during a specific 
immune response. (18)   
Recombinant IFN -γ 1b (Actimmune
®) is commercially available and approved for the treatment 
of the rare pediatric conditions chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and severe malignant 
osteopetrosis (SMO). (18)  It has, however, previously been evaluated in patients with advanced malignancies and thus has a known and proven safety and toxicity profile.  Previous phase III trials of IFN -γ as a single agent in advanced RCC and melanoma did not improve outcomes 
compared to their respective comparator arms, but it was safe and reasonably well tolerated.  (19, 
20)  Additionally, Devane and colleagues performed a dose titration study in healthy volunteers to establish the best tolerated dosing and schedule in adults in regards to the onset of flu- like 
symptoms . (21) 
IFN-γ will be self-administered as a subcutaneous (SQ) injection at a starting dose of 50 mcg/m
2 
on a three times weekly basis.  This starting dose was selected based on data from a phase I dose-
finding study of patients with resected melanomas performed by [CONTACT_479563] (as determined by [CONTACT_479564]) at various doses and routes of administration.(22)   Based on their results and conclusions, IFN- γ 
dosing from 10-100 mcg/m
[ADDRESS_615757] profile.  The 50 mcg/m2 is the approved dose in CGD and SMO and was deemed the 
appropriate starting dose level.   
The recombinant form of IFN-γ is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_479548], but is 
absorbed more slowly by [CONTACT_479565]. (23)  Following SQ injection, greater than 89% of the dose given is absorbed.  As measured at a 100 mcg/m
2 dose, the mean elimination half-life is 5.9 
hours.  Peak plasma concentration is achieved at seven hours following SQ dosing.  No drug accumulation has been reported after twelve consecutive daily injections using a 100 mcg/m
[ADDRESS_615758] cancer and is  widely used in the adjuvant, 
neoadjuvant and metastatic setting. It is administered as an  intravenous (IV) infusion and can be 
used either on a 3- weekly schedule, weekly or every [ADDRESS_615759] occurred in 2% to 4% of  patients receiving paclitaxel in clinical trials; 
thus, patients should be premedicated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H 2 antagonists. 
Combination of taxanes (docetaxel or paclitaxel) with HER2 targeted agents of trastuzumab and pertuzumab is routinely used for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive breast cancer as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced stage  (24) and upfront line of therapy for metastatic 
stage  (25).  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m
2 weekly regimen will be used in combination with trastuzumab 
(8mg/kg loading dose, then 6mg/m2 q 21 days) and pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose, then 420 
mg q 21 days) for this proposed clinical trial. The study protocol is looking at the safety/efficacy 
of the combination of standard therapy (paclitaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab) and the study drug, interferon- gamma.  Known potential adverse effects from the standard therapy (paclitax el, 
trastuzumab and pertuzumab) include but are not limited to neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenic fever, sepsis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, allergic reaction, neuropathy, alopecia and liver enzyme elevation and ejection fraction decline/ congestive heart failure.  In addition, known adverse reactions from Interferon- gamma include 
flu-like symptoms s uch as fever/chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, myalgia and 
arthralgia and less commonly increased liver enzymes, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic 
reactions.

4. TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Agent  Administration  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Reported adverse events and appropriate 
dose modifications for all agents  are described in Section 5.1. No investigational or commercial 
agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_259730]’s malignancy.  
 The portions of the treatment regimen that must be administered as per protocol guidelines include the following. Each cycle will be consisted of 21 days. 
• Cycle s  1 to 4: IFN-γ + paclitaxel  + trastuzumab + pertuzumab  (phase I and II 
portions of study)  
• Biopsies and/or tissue acquisition (phas e I or II portion) 
• Surgery ( phase II portion only)  
 
4.1.1 IFN-γ + Paclitaxel + Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab  
• IFN-γ (50, 75 mcg/m
2), three times weekly for 12 weeks . Patients and/or 
caregivers will be trained on self -administration of subcutaneous IFN-γ on 
Cycle 1 Day 1  (C1D1).. Patients will document each dose of 
administration in a diary provided to them by [CONTACT_9137].  
• On C1D1, patients will perform supervised self -administration of IFN-γ at 
Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) clinical research unit (CRU) and will receive their first dose of paclitaxel at least 1 hour after the IFN-γ 
injection.  
• Paclitaxel 80 mg/m
2 IV infusion over 1 hour weekly x 12 weeks (days  1, 
8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 79) 
• Trastuzumab will be given using an 8  mg/kg loading dose on C1D1, 
followed by 6 mg/kg IV on subsequent cycles q21 days.  
• Pertuzumab will be given using an 840 mg IV loading dose on C1D1, 
followed by 420 mg IV on subsequent cycles q21 days.  
• Repeat paclitaxel weekly x 12 doses if: (a) ANC  ≥ 1000/µ L, platelets 
≥ 50,000/µ L, (b) recovered from non- hematologic toxicity to grade 1 or 
less (except alopecia), or grade 2 or less neuropathy. G -CSF may be added 
if there is febrile neutropenia or neutropenia preventing treatment on schedule (see Section s 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 for guidelines). If treatment cycles 
are delayed, a minimum of 12 paclitaxel ± IFN-γ injection cycles must be

 completed within 16 weeks. 
• Patients will be assessed for DLTs during the first 3 week period of cycle 
1 (Phase I) . 
• Tumor assessments with computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis (CT CAP), as well as optional nuclear medicine bone scan per 
physician discretion, will occ ur after four  cycles (at the conclusion of the 
study treatment) on or about C5D1, then per standard of therapy  thereafter  
at the treating physician’s discretion(Phase I) .   
• Study treatment will conclude after four 21-day cycles at which point IFN-
γ will be  stopped and patients who are clinically benefitting will continue 
to receive the standard therapy per the treating physician’s discretion.  
• Tumor assessments with clinical breast examination will occur on each 
cycle during  neoadjuvant therapy (a total of 4  cycles) and patients will go 
for definitive surgery. Adjuvant therapy will be determined further per 
treating physician’s discretion. (Phase II)  
 
       4.1.2    Prophylactic or Supportive Medications 
            IFN -γ 
• Acetaminophen 325 mg orally PRN can be taken 30-60 minutes prior to 
injection for fevers and myalgias and may be used supportively at a dose of 
325-650 mg orally Q6H PRN (≤ 3 gm/day). 
• Anti-depressant medication in the form of a selective serotonin re -uptake 
inhibitor (SSRI) or next generation anti- depressant medication may be taken 
orally by [CONTACT_479568].  This should be 
decided between  the patient and treating clinician.  
• Ibuprofen 200 mg orally to 400 mg orally Q4-6H PRN (≤ 1200 mg/day) may 
be taken prophylactically or for supportive purposes for fevers and myalgias 
assuming adequate renal function as viewed by [CONTACT_68071]  
• Diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg orally Q4- 6H  prn (</= 300  mg/day)  
             Paclitaxel  
• Premedication for paclitaxel: administer dexamethasone [ADDRESS_615769] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 20 
 • Premedication for pertuzumab : administe r diphenhydramine 25-50 mg by [CONTACT_24636] P 
over 2-5 minutes/PO, and an H2 blocker (e.g. ranitidine 50 mg or equivalent) 
30-60 minutes prior to pertuzumab infusion.   
• If the patient is on weekly trastuzumab, pre-medications will be given prior to 
pertuzumab on Day 1 (i.e. Week 1) and prior to trastuzumab on Days 8 and 15 
(i.e. Weeks 2 and 3) of each cycle.  
• Otherwise, f ollow institution ’s guidelines. Additional pre- medications may be 
added per protocol at the discretion of the physician. 
4.1.3 Dose Escalation  Schema and Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
(Phase I)  
 
The phase I will use a 3+[ADDRESS_615770] dose l evel will 
be 50 mcg/ m2 and the second dose level will be 75 mcg/ m2. The DLT evaluation period 
for dose escalation will be during the first three weeks. The MTD dose level is defined as 
the highest dose level with ≤[ADDRESS_615771] dose level 
experience two or more DLTs, then dose de -escalation  will occur to 30 mcg/ m2 dose (see 
table 2).  
 
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle one (C1) is defined as follows:  
• Non- hematologic  or hematologic  toxicities that are ≥ grade 3 in severity 
and probably or definitely  related to study therapy which leads to 
chemotherapy treatment delays > 14 days are considered DL T.

No DLT has been observed out of all [ADDRESS_615776] been 2 out of 6 patients had SAEs including grade 3 pneumonitis (at week 8 therapy and treatment was discontinued subsequently) and grade 3 non-neutropenic fever (at week 6 therapy) respectively, p ossibly related to study 
treatment. These toxicities however did not meet the definition of dose limiting toxicities. Based on these findings suggesting an improved tolerability of DL1, 
the investigators have selected DL1 (5 0 mcg/m2 ) as the recommended pha se 2 
dose.  
 
4.2 Duration of Therapy 
Patients should continue protocol treatment unless one of the following criteria applies, at which 
time protocol therapy should be discontinued: 
• disease progression   
• intercurrent illness that prevents furt her administration of treatment  
• unacceptable adverse events(s)

for further treatment in t he judgment of the investigator 
• completion of protocol therapy (12 weeks)  
• patients who require a delay in the administration of paclitaxel for more than [ADDRESS_615778] be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event.  This condition 
applies to both the phase I and phase II portions of the trial. 
 
4.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_479550], we will use the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_479551] a Simon’s two stage design, 
where the study will seek to determine whether there is an increase in complete pathologic response (pCR, defined by [CONTACT_479569] 0). Since the enrollment of patients involves both ER+ /HER2+  and ER -/HER2+  patients, with the final 
proportion of  ER+ and ER - status patients unknown until the completion of 
enrollment, we  can not  determine ahead of time the pCR rates to test . After [ADDRESS_615779] been enrolled in stage 1 , we will compute the proportion of ER+ and 
ER- subjects and compute the pCR under the null and alternative hypothesis as 
outlined in Section 12.1. Using 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅1
𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏   and 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅1𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡 rates 
determined from the stage 1 enrollment of ER+ and ER- patients, we will deter mine the needed number of pCRs to determine if the study should stop or 
proceed to Stage 2.   
 For
 safety , there is an interim safety analysis upon completion of phase I  and the 
first stage of phase II. For phase II, after the enrollment of the first 6 patients in 
stage 1 of the phase II study, if at any time more than 50% of the treated patients 
experience a G3 -4 toxicity related to IFN-γ which leads to chemotherapy 
treatment delays > 14 days or unplanned cessation of neoadjuvant treatment then accrual to the trial will be held until discussions with the sponsor and protocol monitoring committee are arranged to determine if accrual can resume. Any deaths on study treatment will trigger an immediate safety  review and accrual 
hold until the event is fully investigated and a determination is made by [CONTACT_479570].  
 4.4  Duration of Follow up  
• After all therapy has been completed, patients will be followed for rec urrence and 
survival for up to 2 years after registration.  (Every 6 months per either medical records or 
phone calls)

 • Blood samples will be collected for biomarker s at baseline, 3 month, 6 month and 12 
month follow up visit s. 
• Any patients who experience adverse events related to the study drug should be followed 
until one of the following occurs: 
o Resolution of the adverse event to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline severity 
o Determination that the adverse event is stable and is unlikely to resolve  
o Initiation o f another anti -cancer treatment  
 
5. REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
5.1 Reported Adverse Events  
 
5.1.1 Paclitaxel  
• Hematologic: Myelosuppression (neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
anemia).  
• Hypersensitivity: Thought to be caused by [CONTACT_479571]. Minor 
symptoms include hypotension, flushing, chest pain, abdominal or extremity pain, skin reactions, pruritus, dyspnea, and tachycardia. More severe reactions include hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea with bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, and angioedema. The majority (53%) of the reported reactions occurred 
within 2 -3 minutes of initiation of treatment and 78% occurred within the first [ADDRESS_615781] and second doses. 
• Cardiovascular: Atrial arrhy thmia (sinus bradycardia [usually transient and 
asymptomatic], sinus tachycardia, and premature beats); significant events include syncope, hypotension, other rhythm abnormalities (including ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, and complete heart block requi ring pacemaker placement), 
and myocardial infarction. Hypertension (possibly related to concomitant 
medication - dexamethasone) may also occur.  
• Neurologic: Sensory (taste changes); peripheral neuropathy; arthralgia and 
myalgia (dose -related, more common when colony -stimulating factors are also 
administered); seizures; mood alterations; neuroencephalopathy; hepatic 
encephalopathy; motor neuropathy; and autonomic neuropathy (paralytic ileus 
and symptomatic hypotension).  
• Dermatologic: Alopecia (universal, com plete and often sudden, between days 14  
and 21); injection site reactions (erythema, induration, tenderness, skin 
discoloration); infiltration (phlebitis, cellulitis, ulceration, and necrosis, rare); radiation recall; and rash.  
• Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, pharyngitis, 
typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis), ischemic colitis, and pancreatitis.

Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615782] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 24 
 • Hepatic: Increased AST, ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase; hepatic failure, 
and hepatic necrosis.  
• Other: Fatigue, headache , light -headedness, myopathy, elevated serum creatinine, 
elevated serum triglycerides, and visual abnormalities (sensation of flashing 
lights, blurred vision). 
          5.1.[ADDRESS_615783] significant safety signal observed during clinical trials was cardiac 
dysfunction (principally clinically significant heart failure [CHF]), particularly when trastuzumab was given in combination with an anthracycline -containing 
regimen. Much of the cardiac dysfunction was reversible on discontinuation of 
trastuzumab.  
In addition, during the first infusion with trastuzumab, a symptom complex most 
commonly consisting of fever and/or chills was observed in approximately 40% of patients. The symptoms were usually mild to moderate in severity and controlled with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, or meperidine. These symptoms were uncommon with subsequent infusions. However, in the post -
approval setting, more severe adverse reactions to trastuzumab have been reported. These have been categorized as hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), infusion reactions, and pulmonary events. Rarely, these severe 
reactions culminated in a fatal outco me.  
Trastuzumab appears to be relatively nonimmunogenic. Only [ADDRESS_615784] been rarely 
observed in patients receiving pertuzumab. A low level of cardiac toxicities, predominantly asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), has been reported. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_479552]20698/TOC4129g the rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) were not higher in patients receiving pertuzumab, trastuzumab and docetaxel than in 
those receiving placebo, trastuzumab and docetaxel.  
No fetal studies in humans have been performed but pertuzumab caused 
oligohydramnios, delayed renal development and embryo- fetal deaths in pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys.  Moreover, in the post -marketing setting, cases of 
oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the fetus, 
A Phase I -II Study of Interferon -gamma Plus Weekly Paclitaxel , Trastuzumab and 
Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615785] been reported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab (for further details, 
see trastuzumab prescribing information). Therefore, pertuzumab should not be used in pregnant women. Protocols for ongoing pertuzumab studies indicate that highly effective contraceptive measures must be used; continuous pregnancy monitoring must be performed during the trials and for six months aft er the last 
dose of study drug is administered. Because of the long half -life of pertuzumab 
women should be warned not to become pregnant for at least six months after 
completion of treatment.  
5.1.4 IFN-γ   
Interferon gamma -1b (IFN -g 1b, IFN-γ) is a biologic response modifier with 
diverse immunomodulatory properties. As with other interferons, the main risk of 
IFN-g 1b therapy is the development of “flu- like” or constitutional symptoms 
including fever, headache, chills, myalgia, and fatigue.   These events may 
decrease in severity as treatment continues and may be minimized by [CONTACT_479572] -g 1b. Additionally, the severity of flu- like symptoms may 
be lessened with initial dose titration. Acetaminophen administration may be 
useful in the prevention/alleviation of fever and headache.  
In addition to constitutional symptoms, patients may experience injection site 
reactions, which are usually mild and transient.  While IFN -g 1b therapy is 
generally well tolerated, reversible neutropeni a and thrombocytopenia, as well as, 
elevations in liver function tests (
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) ) have been observed. Caution should be exercised when 
administering IFN -g 1b to patients with myelosuppression or in combination with 
other potentially myelosuppressive agents.  IFN-g 1b does not appear to be 
mutagenic and does not appear to provoke neutralizing antibodies. 
 
5.2 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
 
5.2.1 Criteria for Administering Chemotherapy Paclitaxel and IFN-γ  
                       See Section 4.1.1 for criteria for administering therapy  
 
• If treatment is delayed due to neutropenia, delay treatment until satisfactory ANC 
(as per Section  4.1.1) and resume at 100% dose; filgrastim (5  µg/kg rounded to 
300 or 480 µg  SC daily on days 2 -6 of each cycle) may be used if neutropenia 
prevents administration of weekly paclitaxel on schedule. Filgrastim may also be 
used with weekly paclitaxel if a cycle is complicated by [CONTACT_479] 3 or 4 febrile 
neutropenia.  
• If the  platelet counts  recovery is delayed due to thrombocytopenia, delay 
treatment until satisfactory plate count (as per Section  4.1.1) and resume with one 
dose level reduction in paclitaxel . 
• If treatment is delayed > [ADDRESS_615786] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 26 
  
 5.2.2 Dose Modifications for Toxicity 
Pertuzumab – fixed dose, no modification of dose. If the patient is unable to 
tolerate the standard dose, they will be discontinued from study. 
 Trastuzumab - After consulting with the Principal Investigator, if grade 2 or 
higher infusion reaction occurs and is attributed to Trastuzumab, it may be given on weekly dosing of 2mg/kg.  Paclitaxel – After consulting with the Principal Investigator, if grade 2 or higher 
infusion reaction occurs and is attributed to Paclitaxel, nab- Paclitaxel may be 
given on weekly 80mg/m
[ADDRESS_615787] cycle is dose level  1. 
Patients who require a dose reduction to dose level -2 will be removed from study.   The following toxicities will require reduc tion of paclitaxel by [CONTACT_30560] :  
 
• Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia (fever > 38.5°C and ANC < 1,000/ mm3) between 
courses . Filgrastim may also be used with weekly paclitaxel if a cycle is 
complicated by [CONTACT_479] 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia (see Section 5.2.1 above for 
dosing guidelines)   
• Platelet nadir < 20,000/mm3.  
• Failure to recover adequate platelet count  on the planned day of therapy.  
• Grade 3 -4 non-hematologic toxicity (excluding neuropathy)  
• Grade 3 -4 neuropathy (hold paclitaxel until < grade 2 neuropathy, reduce 
paclitaxel dose one dose level ; keep IFN-γ dose stable)

Classification : Antimicrotubule agent. 
Mode of Action: Promotes microtubule assembly and stabilizes tubulin polymers by 
[CONTACT_114471], resulting in the formation of e xtremely stable and 
nonfunctional microtubules, and consequently inhibition of many cell functions. 
Storage and Stability : The intact vials may be stored under refrigeration or at room 
temperature. Freezing does  not adversely affect the product. Solutions diluted to a 
concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL in normal saline, 5% dextrose, 5% dextrose and 
normal saline, or 5% dextrose in Ringer’s solution are stable for up to 27 hours when stored at room temperature and normal room light. 
Dose Specifics: Refer to Section 4.1.1.  
Preparation : Preparation of standard regimens should follow site standards.  
Administration: Administered as an IV infusion over 1 hour with an in -line 0.22 micron 
filter.  
Incompatibilities : Avoid the use of PVC bags and infusion sets due t o leaching of DEHP 
(plasticizer).  
Drug Interactions : Ketoconazole may inhibit paclitaxel metabolism, based on in  vitro  
data.  
Availability : A concentrated solution of 6 mg/mL in polyoxyethylated castor oil 
(Cremophor EL) 50% and dehydrated alcohol 50% is commercially available in 5  mL 
vials. 100 mg/16.7 mL and 300 mg/50 mL vials are also available. See package insert for further information.  
 
6.2    Trastuzumab 
Formulation  
Trastuzumab is a sterile, white to pale yellow, preservative -free lyophilized powder for 
intravenous (IV) administration. Each vial of trastuzumab contains 440 mg of 
trastuzumab, 9.9 mg of L-histidine HCl, 6.4 mg of L-histadine, 400 mg of α,α- trehalose 
dihydrate, and 1.8 mg of polysorbate 20, USP. Reconstitution with 20 mL of the supplied Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI) USP, containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative, yields 21 mL of a multidose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, at 
a pH of ~6.  
Dosage 
The recommende d initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg trastuzumab administered as a 90 -
minute infusion. The recommended maintenance trastuzumab dose is 6 mg/kg q3wk and 
can be administered as a 30 -minute infusion if the initial loading dose was well tolerated. 
Trastuzumab may be administered in an outpatient setting. If trastuzumab 6mg/kg q 3 wk 
is not tolerated, trastuzumab 2mg/kg q week can be administered. 
Preparation  
A Phase I -II Study of Interferon -gamma Plus Weekly Paclitaxel , Trastuzumab and 
Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615789] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 28 
 Use appropriate aseptic technique. Each vial of trastuzumab should be reconstituted with 
20 mL of BWFI, USP, 1.1% benzyl alcohol preserved, as supplied, to yield a multidose solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab. Immediately upon reconstitution with BWFI, the vial of trastuzumab must be labeled in the area marked “Do not use after” with the future date that is [ADDRESS_615790] be used immediately and any unused portion discarded. Use of other reconstitution diluents 
should be avoided. Determine the dose of trastuzumab needed, based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg for q3wk dosing schedules or a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg trastuzumab/kg for q3w dosing schedules. Calculate the correct dose using 21 mg/mL trastuzumab solution. Withdraw this amount from the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, USP. DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION SHOULD NOT BE USED.  Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. The reconstituted 
preparation results in a colorless to pale yellow transparent solution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to 
administration.  
No incompatibilities between trastuzumab and polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags 
have been observed. 
Storage   
Vials  of trastuzumab are stable at 2C –8C (36F–46F) prior to reconstitution. Do not use 
beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_30473]. A vial of trastuzumab reconstituted with 
BWFI, as supplied, is stable for 28 days after reconstitution when stored refrigerated at 2C–8C (36F–46F), and the solution is preserved for multiple use. Discard any remaining 
multi-dose reconstituted solution after [ADDRESS_615791] is provided as a single use formulation containing 30 mg/mL 
pertuzumab in 20 mM L-histidine acetate (pH 6.0), 120 mM sucrose and 0.02% polysorbate 20. Each 20 mL vial contains 420 mg of Pertuzumab (14.0 mL/vial). Upon receipt, pertuzumab vials are to be refrigerated at 2 °C–8°C (36 °F–46°F) until use. 
Pertuzumab vials should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_149941]. Because the formulation does not contain a preservative, the vial seal m ay 
only be punctured once. Any remaining solution should be discarded. Vial contents should be protected from light, and should not be frozen. The solution of pertuzumab for infusion, diluted in PVC or non-PVC polyolefin bags containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, may be stored for up to 24 hours prior to use. Diluted pertuzumab has been shown to be stable for up to 24 hours at a temperature range of 2°C–25°C. However, since diluted pertuzumab contains no preservative, the diluted solution should be stored refrigerated (2 °C–8°C).  
 
Dosage  
The initial dose of pertuzumab is [ADDRESS_615792] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 29 
 infusion, followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a dose of 420 mg administered over a 
period of 30 - 60 minutes.   
Preparation  
Prepare the solution for infusion, using aseptic technique, as follows:  
  
 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration   
           prior to administration.  
 Withdraw the appropriate volume of pertuzumab liquid concentrate from the vial(s).  
 
Dilute into the 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride PVC or non-PVC polyolefin infusion bags.  
 
Mix diluted solution by [CONTACT_5237]. Do not shake.  
 Administer immediately once prepared.  
Dextrose (5%) solution should not be used to dilute pertuzumab.

Immune Monitoring: Systemic anti- HER2 CD4pos T-cell responses will be generated from 
autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) pulsed with HER2 peptides. PBMC will 
be collected at least three time points about 30 cc blood each draw. IFN-ɣ production will be 
measured by [CONTACT_28745]- linked immun osorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays or by [CONTACT_479576], as previously described (26, 27 ).

Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615795] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 31 
 Briefly, ELISPOT PVDF membrane plates will be coated overnight with anti- IFN-ɣ capture 
antibody (Mabt ech Inc).  The following day, after the plates will be washed with PBS 
(Mediatech Inc) and blocked with 10% human serum/DMEM, 2x105 PBMCs or SLN cells will 
be plated in each well either unstimulated, pulsed with HER2-derived Class II peptide (4 μg) 
(42-56, 98-114, 328-345, 776-790, 927-941, 1166-1180), or pulsed with anti-human CD3/CD28 
antibodies (0.5 µg/mL) (positive control, BD Pharmingen), and incubated at 37oC with 5% CO 2 
for 24 -36 hours.  After the plates will be washed with PBS, 100 µL of detection a ntibody (1 
mg/mL; 7 -B6-1-biotin) will add to each well and the plates will be incubated for 2 hours.  The 
plates will be washed again with PBS, 100 µL of 1:1000 diluted streptavidin-HRP will added to each well and the plates will be incubated for another h our.  TMB substrate solution (Mabtech 
Inc) will added to reveal spot formation.  Spot forming cells (SFC) were counted using an automated reader (ImmunoSpot CTL).  A positive response to an individual HER2 Class II peptide will be defined as a minimum of 20 SFC/2x10
5 cells after subtracting the unstimulated background.  Three metrics will be used to 
quantify the CD4pos Th1 response: (1) responsivity (the proportion of patients responding to ≥ 1 
peptide), (2) response repertoire (the number of peptides to which a patient responds), and (3) cumulative response (the sum of the SFCs across all 6 Class II HER2 peptides) (12).  We will also assess whether there is a change in anti -HER -2 IL-10, IL -4, granzyme B by [CONTACT_479577] a percentage of the samples. Controls will be utilized of normal response proteins 
such as candida, tetanus and anergy will be assessed  by [CONTACT_398]3/CD28 antibody stimulation.  
 
We will assess the CD8 T cell response against HER -2 as well as validate ELISPOT assays using 
in vitro sensitization, CD8
pos T-cells will be selected from the cryopreserved lymphocyte cell 
fractions via negative selection (StemCell Technologies).  Autologous DC1 will be suspended in SFM with GM -CSF (10 ng/ml), pulsed with one of the six Class II HER2 peptides, and co-
cultured with the CD4
pos T-cells at a ratio of 10:1.  IL-2 (30 IU/m; ThermoFisher ) will be added 
on day 2.  On day 10, T- cells will be harvested and tested against T2 target cells pulsed with one 
of the six class II HER2 peptide or irrelevant controls (p53 and colon cancer peptide).  After 24 hours, the supernatant will be harvested and analyzed by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  A positive response to the HER2 peptide will be defined as a two-fold increase in CD8 or CD4
pos T-cell IFN -ɣ production compared to the irrelevant peptide controls.  Again, 
responsivity and response repertoire metrics will be used to quantify the CD4pos immune 
response.  
 7.2 Determine whether IFN -γ combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_479553] : There is data to suggest that  pCR to HER- 2 targeted regimens requires immune 
response (10); we will therefore assess the quality and quantity of the immune infiltrates prior to

know if IFN-γ is more responsive in patients with significant pre- existing immune infiltrate in 
the tumor or not. Being able to identify patients that are likely to respond to immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_479554]. In our neoadjuvant DCIS vaccine studies there is a trend toward more complete

Approach : Using immunohistochemistry, we will assess the change in the quality and quantity 
of the immune infiltrate in subjects receiving the neoadjuvant IFN -γ regimen compared to a 
control matched group not receiving IFN-γ. We will analyze sections from regions of residual 
tumor.  Sect ions of the pre-treatment biopsy and of the residual tumor/tumor bed will be stained

macrophage and DC. We will also perform IHC for IFN-γ on the tumor cells, macrophages (M1 
and M2) on surrounding tissues. PD1 and PD1- L expression  also will be measured . In those with 
sufficient tissue we will perform exploratory analysis examining immune gene signatures using 
standard Affymetrix.  
7.[ADDRESS_615797] response in the HER -2
pos IBC   
 
Rationale : IFN -γ combination therapy may be effective in many but not all patients.  We would 
like develop assays to determine whether this therapy can prevent recurrence, sparing patients 
from additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  A serum HER -2 assay that measures cleaved or circulating HER -2 
protein in the serum will be assessed to correlate with response.  
Rationale for Analysis of Serum HER- 2: Recent d ata suggests that soluble serum HER -[ADDRESS_615798] those at risk to fail therapy ( 28). Since HER -2 is the target antigen and the 
oncodriver it will be useful to determine whether this can serve as a biomarker of response. We will analyze serum HER -2 levels in patients prior to following completion of therapy. We will 
also check serum HER -2 at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months from therapy . .   
 
Approach : [CONTACT_479592] and Martell Co have developed several high -sensitivity HER -[ADDRESS_615799] decreases in serum HER -2 as another potential biomarker of 
response; we will evaluate these biomarkers in the context of t he proposed therapy regimens . 
These assays will be run on pre and post plasma specimens from pa tients on clinical trials . 
Samples of serum or plasma will be sent to Martell for analysis. The assays are based off ELISA 
technology that has been modified to improve sensitivity. 
7.4 Anti -drug ( IFN-γ) neutralizing antibody assay will be done at baseline and at the end of 
treatment (3 months) to evaluate whether IFN -γ stimulates a detectable host antibody 
response

9. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
9.[ADDRESS_615803] cancer  (phase II), the primary endpoint of this study is 
pathologic complete response in the breast at definitive surgery after completion of 
protocol therapy. The pathologic response to treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_238046] (preferably a single pathologist for all patients treated at that institution). The institutional pathologist (Laila Khazai , MD; H. Lee Moffitt Cancer 
Center) will evaluate response by [CONTACT_941] “Residual Cancer Burden” (RCB)  for each patient as 
described in the online calculator 
(http://www3.mdanderson.org/app/medcalc/index.cfm?pagename=jsconvert3
).  
9.1.[ADDRESS_615804] cancer  (phase II), a secondary endpoint will be clinical 
complete response and partial response based upon tumor measurements obtained on physical examination at baseline, after completion of 4 cycles of study therapy . Tumor 
measurements obtained by [CONTACT_479581] a caliper, using metric notation, preferably by [CONTACT_479582][INVESTIGATOR_479555] (or in the same position on each exam), and will be recorded in study specific case report forms. Factors that will be

 9.1.[ADDRESS_615806] cancer  (phase I), response and progression will be 
evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
criteria , version 1.1. RECIST criteria will be used for assessing response in patients with 
metastatic disease using the baseline and post treatment imaging studies, plus physical 
examination when appropriate. For patients with locally advanced disease, phys ician 
examination will be used and measurements recorded at baseline, after completion of study therapy.  
 
 
10. REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
10.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre- existing) 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) after starting study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug (or therapy). An AE will be graded using the National Cancer Institute CTCAE version 4.03. AEs w ill be followed until the safety 
follow up visit ([ADDRESS_615807] dose). A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant, e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations,  or judged relevant by [CONTACT_093], should be reported as an 
AE. 
All AEs will be recorded on the appropriate case report forms (CRF and in the subject’s medical records  starting from the first treatment. The Investigator will also identify the date of onset, date 
of resolution, seriousness, outcome, and the relationship to study drug. Every effort should be made to determine the cause of each AE and whether or not it is related to the study drug. The relationship of the AE to the study drug must be rated and recorded following the guidelines outlined in the CTCAE v4.03. All the AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [CONTACT_403247]. The 3 categories for AE grading are:  
Unrelated  The lack of a temporal relationship of the event to study treatmen t makes a 
causal relationship not reasonably possible, or by [CONTACT_479583], therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions that provide a sufficient explanation

Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615808] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 36 
 Possibl e The temporal relationship of the event to study treatment makes a causal 
relationship reasonably possible,  and the event is more likely explained by 
[CONTACT_479584], therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions  
Definite  The temporal relationship of the event to study treatment make s a definitive 
relationship,  and the event is more likely explained by [CONTACT_479585], therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions  
 
10.2 Serious Adverse Event  
AEs are classified as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that is:  
1. is fatal or life -threatening  
2. requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266]  
3. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacit y  
4. constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect  
5. is medically significant, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Pregnancy, although not itself a serious adverse event, should also be reported on a serious 
adverse event form or pregnancy form and be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth 
defects or congenital abnor malities.  
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314]:  
1.      routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
2.      treatment, which was elective or pre-planned (e.g. surgery as per Phase II of this 
study) for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
3.      treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of serious given above and not resulting in hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
The sponsor is responsible for submitting reports of AEs that are associated with the use of the 
drug that are both serious and unexpected to the FDA. Any serious adverse event occurring after the patient started taking the study medication, and until [ADDRESS_615809] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 37 
 In addition, all SAEs should be reported to H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute 
through Oncore for review by [CONTACT_479586] & Monitoring Committee. They will be 
submitted to IRB per institution policy.   
SAE reporting begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received study treatment. 
However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving study treatment, it needs to be reported ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. SAE 
reporting forms will be completed within 24 hours of the event and e- mailed to: 
Email [EMAIL_9239]
 
FAX for SAEs: [PHONE_10035]  
The drug provider will medically review all SAEs.  
The following detailed information must be recorded for each serious adverse event in the SAE report form:  
• A description of the AE in medical terms  
• The severity grade as assessed by [CONTACT_459711]-CTC Version 4.03 
• The date of becoming serious and the date of becoming known (if different) 
• The reason for seriousness 
• The outcome of the SAE at the time of the report • Information on administration of the study drug and chemotherapy and any action taken • Information on any treatment procedures necessary for the SAE, concomitant 
medications, relevant lab tests and relevant medical history  
If in any one subject the same SAE occurs on several occasions, then the SAE in question must 
be documented and assessed anew each time.  
The investigator is required to submit SAE Follow -up reports until the SAE has resolved or 
stabilized and all queries have been answered.

abnormality is found.  
A Phase I -II Study of Interferon -gamma Plus Weekly Paclitaxel , Trastuzumab and 
Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615811] value abnormalities as such should not be reported on the AE page of the CRF as 
adverse events unless they are treatment -emergent and they satisfy one or more of the following 
conditions for clinical significance:  
1. Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
2. Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation) 
3. Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, 
discontinua tion of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or 
treatment)  
Please note: Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event 
(SAE) should be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an adverse event in the CRF.  
10.[ADDRESS_615812] report all pregnancies within 24 hours to the sponsor and drug provider within 24 hours. The investigat or 
should counsel the patient; discuss the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects 
on the fetus. The patient should be monitored until the conclusion of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a patient participating in the study should also be reported 
to the investigator, the sponsor and the drug provider. The partner should be counseled and 
followed as described above.

authorization holder or the local regulatory bodies. 
10.6 Adverse Events Updates / IND Safety Reports  
Horizon Pharma  shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following 
information:  
• Any AE associated with the use of study drug in other studies that is both serious and 
unexpected.  
• Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a sign ificant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  The Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of these new serious and unexpected 
AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.

 11. DATA MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Data Collection  
The Clinical Research Coordinators and Investigators of each site will be responsible for the 
recording of the site’s data into the electronic data capture system, ONCORE.  
11.2 Protocol Monitoring Committee  
The Protocol monitoring commit tee (PMC) will be composed of medical and statistical 
independent reviewers and will meet to review the efficacy and safety data and determine a risk/benefit analysis in this subject population. The purpose of the PMC is to advise on serious safety considerations, lack of efficacy and any other considerations within the charge to the Committee. The PMC may request additional meetings or safety reports as deemed necessary upon discussion with the principal investigator. The PMC may stop the study following r eview 
of results from each interim analysis. The PMC meets once a month. 
11.3 Study Monitoring and Auditing  
11.3.1 Investigator Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and in the US Code of Federal Regulations.  
Investigators, or a designated member, must enter study data onto CRFs or other data collection 
system. The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring visits and audits by [CONTACT_479587], IRB/EC review, and regulatory inspection(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, 
TPP), providing direct access to the facilities where the study took place, to source documents, to CRFs, and to all other study documents.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator ’s staff, must be available at some 
time during monitoring visits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to 
the subject’s records (e.g., medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study related charts) for source data v erification. The data collection must be completed prior to each visit and 
be made available to the Horizon Pharma  representative so that the accuracy and completeness 
may be checked.  
11.3.2 Site Responsibilities  
A conference call/study meeting will be he ld monthly to review patient enrollment and accrual, 
safety and toxicity data, and treatment results, as available.  
11.3.3 Monitoring  
Data will be captured in Oncore, Moffitt’s Clinical Trials Database. Regulatory documents and 
case report forms will be monitored internally according to Moffitt Cancer Center Monitoring 
Policies. The monitoring will include source data verification, utilizing research subjects’ medical records.  
A Phase I -II Study of Interferon -gamma Plus Weekly Paclitaxel , Trastuzumab and 
Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615815]’s risks are adequately 
asses sed and communicated to investigators, IRBs/IECs, and regulatory bodies during clinical 
development. 
For this study, safety monitoring activities will include but are not limited to r eview and 
evaluation of single serious adverse event ( SAE ) occurrences in real -time as reported through the 
SAE reporting process outlined in this section of the protocol, and review and evaluation, in real -
time, of one or more occurrences of an uncommon SAE that  is not commonly associated with 
product exposure. Findings and/or safety data obtained during this study will provide information for the overall 
review of safety that is conducted by [CONTACT_17190] a routine basis. The Sponsor will report expeditiously a ny findings from clinical trials (ongoing or completed), epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], 
pooled analysis of multiple studies, and findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a 
significant risk in humans exposed to the study product.  
Safety data collect ion for this study begins at the time of the subject’s receiving the first dose of 
study medication.  The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events 
that meet the definition of an unanticipated problem (refer to protocol Section 10.1), AE or SAE. 
11.4    Interim Analyses  
Efficacy interim analysis  (Phase II) : The first analysis will take place after the first 23 patients 
are accrued and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_479556].  
 
Safety interim analysis: The safety data will be continually assessed as patients are enrolled on 
the study. After the enrollment of the first 6 patients in stage 1 of the phase II study, i f at any 
time more than 50% of the treated patients experience a G3 -4 toxicity related to IFN-γ which 
leads to chemotherapy treatment delays > 14 days or unplanned cessation of neoadjuvant 
treatment then accrual to the trial will be held until discussions with the sponsor and protocol monitoring committee are arranged to determine if accrual can resume. Any deaths on study 
treatment should trigger an immediate safety review and accrual hold until the event is fully investigated and a determination is made by [CONTACT_479570].  
12.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Sample Size Determination  
Phase I (metastatic disease) : There are 2  dose levels, with 3 to 6 patients treated at each dose 
level. Therefore, a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 patients will be treated in the phase I  
portion. Adverse effects will be summarize d using frequency tables. The proportion of patients 
who completed all 12 cycles of paclitaxel (at full dose or with dose modification) will be tabulated. Dose escalation, AEs, overall safety, and efficacy will be monitored by [CONTACT_479588] a Safety Monitoring Committee.

Pertuzumab in Patients with HER -[ADDRESS_615816] 2019                                                                                                                                        Page 41 
 Phase II ( early stage breast cancer):  The study will seek to determine whether there is an 
increase in complete pathologic response (pCR, defined by [CONTACT_479569] 0).  
We will use a Simon’s two stage design with 90% power and a type I error rate of 0.10. The 
choice of this power and type I error rate will ensure an appropriate  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_479557] 1 and 
to ensure adequate power after stage 2 to determine if the treatment is promising. Since the enrollment of patients involves both ER+ /HER2+  and ER -/HER2+ patients, with the final  
proportion of  ER+ and ER - status patients unknown until the completion of enrollment, we  
cannot  determine ahead of time the pCR rates to test . Table 4 presents the designs for the two 
extreme cases,  the scenarios in which all the patients enrolled are either all ER+ or all ER- 
patients. In both extremes, the number of stage [ADDRESS_615817] been enrolled, we will compute the 
proportion of ER+ and ER - subjects and compute the pCR under the null and alternative 
hypothesis based on the following formulas. 
• Will assume baseline/standard of care and study drug rates of 50% ( 𝑝𝑝
0.𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸−)  and 70% 
(𝑝𝑝1.𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸−) for ER - patients.  
• Will assume baseline/standard of care and study drug rates of 25% ( 𝑝𝑝0.𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸+) and 45% 
(𝑝𝑝1.𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸+) for ER + patients . 
• Let 
  and  
  represent the number of ER+ and ER- patients in the study at the 
conclusion of stage 1. 
• Stage 1 baseline pCR rate will be computed as 
. 
• Stage 1 treatment pCR rate will be computed as 
. 
• Using 
  and 
  we wil l determine the needed number of pCRs to 
determine if the study should stop or proceed to Stage 2.   
If the study proceeds to stage 2, f ollowing the enrollment of all patients, the final rates 
(
  and 
 ) to be tested will be based on a weighted average as follows.  
• Let 
  and  
  represent the final number of ER+ and ER- patients in the study  
(stage 1 + stage 2) . 
• Final baseline pCR rate will be computed as 
. 
• Final treatment pCR rate will be computed as 
. 
• Using 
  and 
  we will determine the needed number of pCRs to 
determine if the treatment is promising and warrants additional future studies.

software. The sample sizes the scenarios with all ER+ or all ER - patients, presented in Table 2, 
was computed using PASS version 15.0.1.   
Adverse effects will be summarized using frequency tables. The estimated pCR along with exact 
confidence interval will be presented. The statistical analysis corresponding to the correlative study will be descriptive and exploratory in nature. Therefore, results will be summarized using descriptive statistics and associations will be ev aluated using Fisher exact test.  
12.2 Reporting and Exclusions  
Evaluation of toxicity:  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with protocol therapy.  
Evaluation of clinical and pathologic response  (Phase II) : All patients included in the study 
must be assessed for clinical and pathologic response to treatment, even if there are major 
protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. The definitions of clinical and pathologic 
responses are provided in Section 9. Each patient will be assigned one of the following clinical 
response categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable dise ase, 4) progressive 
disease, 5)  early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death 
because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  A patient with unknown pathologic response due to refusal of surgery  for non -
medical  reasons will be replaced with another patient.  
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main analysis of the 
response rate. Patients in response categories 4  to 9 should be considered as failing to respond to 
treatment (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration 
does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Preci se definitions for 
categories [ADDRESS_615819] been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major 
protocol violations).  However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.

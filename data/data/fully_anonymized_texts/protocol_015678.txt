Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_1095485] Title: 24-hour oral morphine equivalent based opi[INVESTIGATOR_794285]:  Ana Fernandez -Bustamante, MD  
 
Version Date: 02/12/2021        
 I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims:   
 We have previously shown that 83% of patients after Cesarean section and 71% of thoracic surgery report taking half or less of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794286] d; 53% and 45% respectively report taking 
five or less of the prescribed pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] .
1 Such overprescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_794287] 75% of cases.1,[ADDRESS_1095486] proven the efficacy of 
patient-centered pain management approaches, we can improve surgical pain therapy on a large scale.  
 
Specific Aim: We will utilize the electronic health record  to indi viduali ze pain therapy in surgical 
patients after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794288] 24-hour opi[INVESTIGATOR_794289].  Our p reliminary data indicate that current opi[INVESTIGATOR_794290] a “o ne size fits all” pattern.[ADDRESS_1095487] Cesarean s ection patients anticipated to use about half or less of the 
usually prescribed amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794291] (prescription as usual).  This protocol addresses only Specific  Aim #3 of the original grant. Specific Aim #1 and #2 are 
addressed under a separate COMIRB protocol #14-1938. 
 
II. Background and Significance:  
 
Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_794292] a leading cause of death in the general 
population.4,[ADDRESS_1095488] shown that long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_794293] 22% of patients following 
surgery.[ADDRESS_1095489] -operative 
pain therapy and reduce our reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
 
Protocol Template Page 2 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 Converting knowledge on actual need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_794294] -prescription of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794295]-medical use.16 The 
objective  of this aim is to prescribe pain medications after surgery in a pa tient-centered fashion. 
We will use the average amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] (in oral morphine equivalents - OME) taken 
in the last [ADDRESS_1095490]-operative pain control. The calculated “last 24 hour OME dose” will be applied to generate a recommendation for the pres cription of a cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_794296]- discharge pain medication is made, e.g. via di splaying the last 24-hour 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_794297] (EHR). The rationale is that testing of such a decis ion-
making tool will lay the ground work to translate the findings of this project into more secure and 
efficient opi[INVESTIGATOR_794298] a system -wide level. Upon completion, we expect to have 
developed an effective dec ision-making tool t o help providers estimate required pain medication 
following patient discharge.  
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
 
Preliminary Studies.  In a cohort of 652 
patients who had undergone surgery at UCH Metro clinicians chose the same cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533] ( 300 oral morphine 
equivalents) in more than 75% of patients 
for the discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447]  
(Figure 1). These data indicate that opi[INVESTIGATOR_794299], but rather that most patients r eceive a very 
similar regimen for post-discharge pain 
management. Using the same EHR (Epic) 
database that generated the data above, we are able to generate information on types and doses of pain medications that are administered to patients, who are s till in th e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794300] ([CONTACT_202635], Chief Medical Information Officer and 
[CONTACT_794359], CMO at UCHealth strongly support this project). We have previously shown that 
83% of patients af ter Cesarean section and 71% of thoracic surgery  patients  report taking half or 
less of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794301]; 53% and 45% respectively report taking five or less of the prescribed 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].
1 Hence, a “one size fits all” appr oach to pain management after discharge is common in 
clinical practice and leads to fr equent over -prescription of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Based on our own preliminary 
data and recommendation published by [CONTACT_2312], opi[INVESTIGATOR_794302] [ADDRESS_1095491] been suggested for patients taking equal or less than 22.5 MME in the 24 hours 
prior to discharge:  
- no opi[INVESTIGATOR_794303] t 24 hours prior to 
discharge  
- 75 morphine mi lligram equivalent (MME), e.g. [ADDRESS_1095492] 24 hours prior to discharge.17

A.  Outcome Measure(s):   
 
Figure 4:  Cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_794304] 
(OME) prescribed to 652 patients upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794305]. Cli nicians chose the same cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_40479] (300 OME) in more than 75% of patients.  
Protocol Template Page 3 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_1095493]- discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_794306], self-reported analgesic medication requirements (post-discharge intake of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_416038], left- over opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], intake of other pain medications, such as 
acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs – NSAIDs), NIH PROMIS18 
outcomes for Pain Intensity and Pain Interference, side effects, reasons for not taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], as well as basic demographic information. We will also collect information about need for additi onal opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155], and reported medication disposal for left-over 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], repeat vs. first C -section and other relevant 
perioperative variables . For this study, we will be using REDC ap for data collection after 
Cesarean section to administer four weekly surveys following the day of discharge.  
 We will seek follow-up with providers about the usefulness  and acceptability of the EHR -
based intervention. Providers will be surveyed with a REDCap survey using a modified 
version of the GUIDES  checklist, which provides a tool to improve the successful use of 
guideline-based computerized clinical decision support.

B. Description of Population to be Enrolled:   
 
Survey population:  Inflating enrollment by  [CONTACT_3450]  25% to ac count for drop out and result in 44 patient 
completers, we will consent 60 adult patients receiving a Cesarean section pr ocedure.  
After completing an observational study in three surgical groups (thoracic surgery, 
gastrointestinal surgery, C -section), we chose to eval uate this intervention first in C -
Section patients based on their unique characteristics: low procedural variability, low 
incidences of chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and low level of comorbidities. Also, the issue of having 
potentially unsecured opi[INVESTIGATOR_322748] a household with young children is of special relevance 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_794307] c ohort.
19 
 Inclusion Criteria: 1) Women  ages at least 18 years  of age having undergone Cesarean 
section surgery at the University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794308]. 2) Willingness to 
complete weekly surveys for 4 weeks after discharge. 3) Anticipated to need half or less 
of the usually prescribed amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794309] 24 hours prior to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_794310] (only patients who 
took 22.[ADDRESS_1095494] 24 hours prior to the day of discharge will be eligible for this study) . Inclusi on and exclusion criteria (including the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794311] 24 hours prior to discharge) will be evaluated in the morning in patients scheduled to be discharged later that day.   
Exclusion Criteria:  1) Patients under the age of 18 years, 2) Patients returning to 
institutional settings (e.g. prison, jail, mental health facility), 3) Pregnant women (patients 
will be approached after their C-section) , 4) Decisionally challenged patients, 5 ) Blind or 
illiterate patients .  
 
Based on our prior r esea rch factors such as emergency status, prior opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], repeat 
vs primary C -section, and associated procedures were not associated with post-
discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_794312]-24 hour inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Hence, these patients  will not be excl uded. 
 
 
 
Protocol Template Page 4 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 We will perform a randomized clinical trial (RCT)  of an EHR-based recommendation to 
prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_794313] 24-hour inpatient use 
according to current recommendations  and evaluate its effect o n the amount o f opi[INVESTIGATOR_794314] .  
 
The medical provider of each patient enrolled (up to n=60) will also be surveyed using 
an online REDCap survey. Inclusion criteria: 1) Medical provider of a patient enrolled in 
the study, 2) Willingness to use the Prescription Tool and complete an online survey. No 
exclusion criteria.  
 Total number of participants counting both patients and providers  will be 114; up to 60 
patients and 54 providers enrolled in the study.  
 
C. Study Design and Resea rch Methods   
Using the UCH Epic/Clarity database, we will continuously identify all patients who underwent Cesarean section surgery at University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
 Patients will be approached 
regarding interest in the study prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473013]. A trained PRA, Perinatal 
CTRC staff or other trained provider will explain the study to prospective participants  
using standard language. Participants will be told that they are being asked to be in this research study because they recently had surgery at the University  of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
If the patient is interested in participation the study PRA, Perinatal CTRC staff or trained 
provider will review the consent/HIPAA form with the patient and answer any questions 
the patient may have. Study  staff will also prov ide them with a hard copy of the 
consent/HIPAA form.  
 - OR – 
  
During the SARS -CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic or as required by [CONTACT_794346], we will 
minimize in-person contact [CONTACT_794347] y whenever 
possible. Perin atal CTR C sta ff will obtain informed consent from patients using the 
procedures detailed below . 
Consent-HIPAA authorization will be obtained remotely  via phone or HIPAA-compliant 
videoconference application (Zoom) following COMIRB guidance (CG-85, Version April 
9, 2020).  
 A tra ined provider with appropriate PPE , who is already providing standard care to the 
patient, will give the patient a hard copy of the consent/HIPAA form  so they have an 
approved copy of the consent form “in hand” at the time of t he informed consent 
discussion .  
 
 Perinatal CTRC staff will call the patient to initiate the informed consent discussion.  
 The discussion will begin with identification of who is  participating on the call ; 
Perin atal CTRC staff will confirm  the potential subject has  a hard copy of the 
consent-HIPAA form before beginning the dis cussion . 
 Perinatal CTRC staff will review the cons ent/HIP AA form  with the patient  and answer 
any questions. 
Protocol Template Page 5 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
  The patient will sign the consent-HIPAA form and give it to the trained provider already 
providi ng standard care. The provider will give the signed form  to Perinatal CTRC staff  
who will also sign the form noting that consent was obtained by [CONTACT_648]. A  copy of the 
signed consent-HIPAA form will be given to the patient.  
  
We will see k a waiver of written consent for surveying  providers who are given the 
dosing suggestion via the EHR -based Prescription Tool . At their convenience, these 
providers will complete an online postcard consent and survey via REDCap.   
 
After consent, demographics and t he best cont act information will be collected (remotely 
by [CONTACT_235469] -19 pandemic  or as re quired by [CONTACT_794346] ) from those 
enrolled patients who indicate they are interested in completing the survey s after their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
We expect 44 patients to complete all four weekly surveys and we define the intent-to -
treat sample as patients who complete one or more surveys (providing at least one 
observation to be used in analyses) .  To conservatively allow for increased variability 
due to attrition, 60 patients will be randomized equally electronically  to intervention 
(prescription tool) or no intervention (prescription as usual). We will use an electronic  
randomization scheme created so that the principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_794315] d to a ssignment.   
 At the time of writing the prescription for a patient the provider will be informed that a 
patient may be considered for a lower post-discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533] (No opi[INVESTIGATOR_794316] [ADDRESS_1095495] 24 hours ). No dosing recommendations for patients having taken more than 22.5 
MME will be made as these patients are not eligible for this  study. F inal dosing decisions 
and drug choices will remain at the discretion of the treating provider and decisions will be tracked.  
 For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the provider information (best practice alert – BPA) will be 
operationalized via a written recommendation on paper handed to the provider by [CONTACT_794348] a sealed envelope or emailed with a read receipt that the provider will be asked 
to open and read. Alternatively , the BPA may be presented electronically using a screen. 
Providers will b e asked to acknowled ge that they read the BPA by [CONTACT_794349] .  
 
For the intervention group:  
For patients receiving no opi[INVESTIGATOR_487547] 24 hours prior to an oxycodone or oxycodone/acetaminophen discharge prescription being written:  
 BPA:  “In the last 24 hours, your  patient received NO opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Consider not 
prescribing any opi[INVESTIGATOR_794317].”  
 
For patients receiving >0 MME up to < 22.[ADDRESS_1095496] 24 hours prior to an 
oxycodone or oxycodone/acetaminophen di scha rge prescription being written (example 
BPA is for 15 MME – 2 oxycodone 5mg tablets):  
 
Protocol Template Page 6 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 BPA: “In the last 24 hours, your patient received opi[INVESTIGATOR_137528] 2 
oxycodone 5 mg tablets by [CONTACT_1966]. Consider writing for a total of 10 oxycodone 5 
mg tablets for pain management after discharge.”  
 
Note, oxycodone-containing medications are the opi[INVESTIGATOR_794318] >96% of cases after Cesarean section at our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We will make equivalent recommendations if hydrocodone is used. Based on our data, no other opi[INVESTIGATOR_794319].  
 
For the control group:  
BPA:  “Consider prescribing the usual medications for pain management after 
discharge.”  
 
One week after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794320] d patients will be contact[CONTACT_794350]. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_1095497], or equivalent 
money order if requested, for each of four weekly surveys, for a total of $40. All enrolled 
patients  will complete the w eekly post-discharge surveys within REDCap  or by [CONTACT_794351] .  
 Providers will not be paid to use the Prescription Tool or complete the short, one-time online survey.   
D.   Description, Risks, Justification of Pr ocedures and Data Collection Tools:  
 
Discomforts and other possible risks include:  
Common Risks:  
• Tiredness or boredom when completing study assessments.   
Uncommon Risks: 
• Tension or nervousness  may occur from completing the study assess ments. 
Particip ants can talk with the researchers about such problems, and can 
terminate the study if they  wish.  
  
• Problems with pain management.  
Only patients who are predicted to require approximately half or less than the 
usually prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533] (i.e., those taking  equal or less than 22.5 MME in 
the 24 hours prior to discharge) will be  eligible. Patients will be randomized to have 
their provider receive a suggestion for a reduction of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794321]. Providers may still choose to prescribe a higher d ose as clinically 
indicated. The prescription tool will only make a suggestion. We will track the 
recommendation made as well as the actual dose prescribed.  
 
We will follow up with all patients at half of their usual follow -up period (usually 2 
weeks ) via a REDCap survey, phone, email, or in clinic to assess how they are 
doing and if they are likely to run out of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794322]. For patients, who are running low on opi[INVESTIGATOR_248628] n 
medications, we wi ll arrange for additional pain medications to be prescribed as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_794352]. We will monitor the study progress closely and reassess our study design 
Protocol Template Page 7 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 if more than 5 intervention group patients require prescriptions  prior to scheduled 
clinic follow -up.  
 
All patients  are routinely given a phone number where they can reach a surgical  
provider 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in case pain therapy is inadequate.  
 
The study team will m onitor need for secondary prescriptions from providers to 
ensure that no significant under -prescription of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794323].   
 
These recommendations are in accordance with current quality improvement 
efforts by [CONTACT_3433] e system -wide Pharmac y and Therapeutics  (P&T ) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_794324]. This committee is 
co-chaired by [CONTACT_24478] -I of this study (Karsten Bartels) and [CONTACT_794360], 
Pharm.D . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_794325] -wide UCHealth Opi[INVESTIGATOR_794326]. Jean Kutner. 
This committee also supports this application. Lastly, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_794327] 5-year NIH K23 gr ant “Improving Opi[INVESTIGATOR_794328] ” that provides material and personal support, statistical support, and 
regulatory support for this application.  
 
Rare But Serious Risks:  
• Breaches of confidentiality.   
  
Confidentiality is maintained throughout the study’s entirety and protected health 
information will not be disclosed outside the University of Colorado. The study therefore does not involve any more than minimal risk to patients, namely loss of confidentiality. While there is no direct ben efit to subjects, knowledge gained 
from our study will help to tailor prescription of analgesic medications after surgery to patients’ actual needs.  
 
Strict safeguards for data protection will be followed including storage on protected servers, passw ord protec tion and monitored access to authorized 
users. Please see the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan section for additional details. Patients are provided with the PI’s office phone number, COMIRB’s phone number, and the PI’s email addres s and phone number s hould they have 
any questions. Patients may withdraw from the study at any time.     
 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  
 
Each participant will be assigned a corresponding study ID number. ID numbers will be 
assigned in the order of patient enrollment. A master list connecting the enrollment 
number with the patient’s medical history number will be maintained only for the duration of the data collection. Only PI-approved study personnel  who have current COMIRB-
required human subject protection training w ill have password -protected and monitored 
access to the data. Following the interpretation of the data, the master list will be 
destroyed and no patient identifying information will be maintained.    
Protocol Template Page 8 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 Demographic data, information on prescribed and non-pres cribed medications, and 
clinical outcome values relevant for pain management will be obtained from the E pic 
database and stored in a secure fashion using REDCap .  
 
E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
Concomitant provider education may itself lead to a change in pa in management 
practices. To address this, a future larger pragmatic clini cal trial could include cluster 
randomization based on study site.  Few prognostic models actually are in clinical use, 
often be cause they have not been externally validated and becaus e of the data collection 
burden. Our local Clinical Decision Support Program has confirmed the feasibility of our 
proposal to integrate a future decision-making tool into the electronic medical record and order entry system .  
 
F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) sample is defined as those who complete at least one survey. In 
our prior observational study, 100% of the C -section patients satisfied this criterion. If there 
is a subsample that does not complete at leas t one survey, we wi ll compare that group to 
the ITT group on relevant demographic and clinical characteristics . Outcomes not 
requiring any response to the survey will be compared for all patients enrolled, regardless 
if they completed at least one survey.  The prescription to ol and prescription as usual  (PAU) groups will be compared on baseline 
demographic and clinical characteristics using Mann-Whitney tests, independent t-tests 
and chi -square tests as appropriate for continuous and categorical data; when necessary 
(i.e. when variables have distributions violating assumptions), nonparametric procedures 
will be substituted. We expect randomization to ensure group equivalence; should 
variables be different they will be evaluated as covariates in the analyses described below  
as appropriate.   
 Our primary analyses will compare the prescription tool  group with the PAU group on oral 
morphine equivalent dose left over (not used) from the total amount of prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Based on our preliminary data, we will assume the control gr oup to receive an opi[INVESTIGATOR_794329] 20 oxycodone 5mg tablets (150MME), leading to a mean MME of 101.8 (SD 60.5) left over. Conservatively estimating a 50% adoption rate of the decision support 
tool by [CONTACT_794353], we would expect a mean MM E of 55 (SD 37.6) left over 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_794330]. Assuming statistical comparisons will be made using 
Mann-Wh itney test a sample size of n=22 per group (44 total using 1:1 allocation) will yield 
90% power with an assumed one-tailed alpha of 0.0 5 (G-Power, version [IP_ADDRESS]).
[ADDRESS_1095498] (i.e. weekly scores for pain interference and pain intensity), trajectories will first be visually compared between the two groups. Mixed models will then be used to analyze each outcome that will include fixed group, time, and group by [CONTACT_794354].  Covariates will only be included if they differ by [CONTACT_794355]. The  test of the group by [CONTACT_794356]. Overall means for each outcome will 
be estimated and compared between groups as will week 1 and week 4 means of each outcome will be separately compared between groups. These analyses on the ITT sample  
will then be repeated on the subset of patients who complete all 4 surveys and any 
differences between results will be reported. 
Protocol Template Page 9 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_1095499], nonparametric, and c ovari ate-a djusted (i.e. ANCOVA) methods as 
appropriate are: need for additional opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155]  (yes, no) , and amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_794331] (total  mg). Reported medication disposal by [CONTACT_794357]. 
 
G.  Summ arize  Knowledge to be Gained:   
We expect to have designed and demonstrated the feasibility of implementation of a 
decision-making support tool to better estimate individual patient needs for pain therapy after surgery. The instrument will be parsimonious  in na ture, as it will rely on information 
that is readily available in the patient’s medical record and it will not require any special action by [CONTACT_794358] a dosage recommendation. Creating such a tool will be 
critical to translate the findi ngs of  this line of research into safer opi[INVESTIGATOR_794332]. Given that the tool can be integrated into a nationally used 
electronic medical record and order entry system (Epic), usage and further testing of its  
performance wi ll be poss ible in many diverse environments. Eventually, public health will 
be promoted through improving non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_794333]. This will lead to a subsequent decreased avai lability 
of opi [INVESTIGATOR_794334]-medical use. F urther, the data obtained from this aim will be 
used for a subsequent grant application.

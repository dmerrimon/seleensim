STATISTICAL METHODS: 
Efficacy: 
The proportion of patients with PS A decline by 50% from baseline (PSA 50) will be evaluated. The primary 
efficacy endpoint is the percent of patients achieving PSA 50 with docetaxel and carboplatin. The historical 
comparison is a PSA 50 of 26%. The target response rate is 60%. The study will follow an optimal two-stage 
Simon design (Simon, 1989) where the null hypothesis that  the true PSA response rate (PSA decline by 50% 
from baseline) is 0.[ADDRESS_1098603] stage if the 
response rate is low. Our null and alternative hypotheses are H0: p ≤26% vs. H1: p ≥60%. The minimax 2-stage design 
for these parameters requires a first stage enrolling [ADDRESS_1098604] 5 patients achieves a PSA 50 response, H0 
cannot be rejected. If ≥ [ADDRESS_1098605] completed the 
trial, and the response rate is calculated for all 14 patients. If ≤[ADDRESS_1098606] a PSA 50 the null hypothesis cannot 
be rejected. This design will pr ovide 80% power to detect a PSA 50 rate of 60% (one-sided α=0.05). This design also 
provides a 60% probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_223854] H0 is true, affording protection against treating more patients than 
necessary if the treatment is not effective.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Therapy for metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) 
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men with approximately 220,000 new cases per year 
in the [LOCATION_002] alone. Roughly 10-20% of patie nts present with metastatic disease, and 40% of 
patients relapse after surgery or radiatio n therapy for presumed localized disease. 
While androgen-deprivation therapy for advanced prosta te cancer is usually initially effective, almost 
all tumors eventually become cast ration resistant after a median of 18-24 months. The currently FDA 
approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_796507]: do cetaxel (Taxotere), the AR targeting agents 
abiraterone (Zytiga) and enzalutamide (Xtandi) prior to or after docetaxel, radium 223 (Xofigo) for 
patients declining docetaxel or after docetaxel, sipuleucel-T (Provenge) prior to or after docetaxel, and cabazitaxel (Jevtana). Thus, there are many new treatment options for men with metastatic CRPC. One major challenge for the field is to identify subsets of patients whose cancer biology is distinct and may 
disproportionally benefit from treatment regimen s that would otherwise not be considered. 
 
 
In current clinical practice most patients r eceive either abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 
often radium 223, prior to docetaxel in the metastatic CRPC setting. 
The second-generation AR-targeting agents abiraterone  and enzalutamide are FDA-approved prior to 
docetaxel in patients with metastatic CRPC. No prospective studies have been performed with 
docetaxel after either agent, and these are unlikely to be carried out give n the cost and lack of industry 
sponsor. Single institution series suggest that treatmen t of prostate cancer with abiraterone prior to 
docetaxel reduces PSA response rates and pr ogression free survival (PFS) to docetaxel 
1. These results 
compare to the phase III registration stud ies of docetaxel (TAX-327) in which PSA 50 was 45-50%, PFS 
6 months and median OS of 18-19 months {Petrylak, 2004 #2233, Tannock, 2004 #2882). 
 
Together, these suggest that in the current treatment environment docetaxel  is significantly less efficacious 
than has been reported in the regist ry studies, highlighting the need for approaches to improve docetaxel 
efficacy

9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098617] chemotherapeutic agent FDA approved fo r the treatment of CRPC was the DNA- damaging 
anthracycline, mitoxantrone {Tannock, 1996 #2883}. Subsequent studies of the use of Satraplatin, a 
platinum agent in phase III randomized studies as sec ond line chemotherapy (including after docetaxel) 
demonstrated a significant improvement in progression free survival (HR 0.67, PFS 11 weeks, PSA 50 
25%) 2. Based on this evidence, investigators hypothe sized that combining the DNA damaging agent 
carboplatin with docetaxel could improve efficacy. A 
CALGB phase II study of the combination of do cetaxel and carboplati n with estramustine i nduced a 
PSA50 response rate of 68% with pr ogression free survival of 8 months 3. 
Estramustine is no longer considered because not only did it fail to improve response or survival 
compared to docetaxel alone, but it also added significant toxicity. Later studies indicated that 
combination therapy with a DNA damaging platinum and docetaxel improved response in previously 
treated tumors mCRPC2. In patients with tumors refractory to docetaxel, the addition of carboplatin has 
been reported to result in a PSA 50 rate of 18% and PFS of 3 months 4. These results provide evidence 
that combining the DNA damaging agent carbopla tin with docetaxel could improve efficacy, 
particularly in the right tumor context, such as known sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as platinums and anthracyclines.

Platinum compounds, such as carboplatin and cisplatin , are believed to exert their anti-tumor effects 
through crosslinking of DNA, which in turn inhib its DNA synthesis and repair. As a result, tumors 
with defects in DNA repair, and those with mutati ons in homologous recombination mutations such as 
BRCA1/2-Fanconi anemia pathway genes are particul arly sensitive to platinum agents and poly-ADP-
ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). The relati onship between BRCA1/2-Fanconi anemia pathway 
and platinum sensitivity is well- described in breast and ovarian cancers5,6. 
 
The relationship between DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemot herapi[INVESTIGATOR_796508] s uggests that an as-yet unidentified subset of patients 
benefitted most from treatment due to  specific tumor biology. We believe this is a subset of patients with 
defects in homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathway genes. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1098618] atic, castration resistant prostate cancer 
as part of the SU2C Prostate Dream Team resear ch study at UWMC/FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER 
(CC-IRB # 7917) to better characterize the molecular subtyp es of mCRPC. Indeed, current analyses have revealed 
approximately 20% of CRPC metastatic tumors contain biallelic inactivation of BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM (De 
Bono, unpublished). In approximately half of these cas es, inactivation results from heterozygous copy loss in 
combination with a germline mutation, whereas in the other half of tumors inactivation results from homozygous copy 
loss. Most mutations identified thus far are in the BRCA2 gene, but mutations have also been identified in BRCA1, 
ATM, and other BRCA1/2-Fanconi anemia pathway genes (D e Bono, unpublished data). Thus, the 20% of patients 
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098619] inactivation  
10  with mCRPC whose tumors harbor biallelic inactivati on of BRCA1/2, ATM and other DNA repair enzymes may be 
the subset with increased sensitivity to  treatment with DNA-damaging agents su ch as carboplatin in the earlier studies 
of unselected patients with mCRPC described above. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1098620] identified three patients from UW/FRE D HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER who tumors 
contain biallelic inactivation in one of these th ree genes using either UW-Oncoplex or UWMC 
sequencing and have been successfully treated with  regimens containing DNA damaging agents, either 
docetaxel with carboplatin (60 mg/m2 and AUC 5 every 21 days, 2 patients) or doxorubicin with 
carboplatin (1 patient). Two of the patients were tr eated with first-line docetaxel, one of whom was 
primarily refractory to docetaxel. All three patients experienced significant PSA responses. 
 
 Patient 1 developed liver metastasis, had a limited response docetaxel, and no response to 
abiraterone and enzalutamide, and was ultimat ely treated with two prolonged cycles of 
docetaxel and carboplatin. 
 Patient 2 was treated docetaxel/carboplatin with co mplete response in his metastatic liver disease 
and subsequently treated with “m aintenance” carboplatin and achieved two years of progression 
free survival. 
 
Patient [ADDRESS_1098621] based on the knowledge of his BRCA2 sequencing results and has achieved a greater than 
50% PSA decline (PSA 50). 
 
In summary, 3 of 3 UWMC/FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER patients with tumors 
containing biallelic BRCA2 inactiv ation achieved dramatic and some times very prolonged clinical 
responses to DNA damaging agents despi[INVESTIGATOR_796509]-line docetaxel and second line hor monal agents. One case se ries of germline BRCA 
mutations carriers (unselected for biallelic loss) included a germline BRCA2 carrier with prostate 
cancer treated with docetaxel/carboplatin who survived for [ADDRESS_1098622] progressed after any succession of front-line agents. 
Sequencing results may be procured through UW-O ncoplex, SU2C or other commercial sequencing 
assays (e.g., Foundation One). If the true rate of respon se is 80% or higher (the anticipated result) in 
the prospective patient population, a very limited nu mber of patients will be needed to demonstrate 
statistically significant superiority over docetaxel alone after any front-line agents (PSA 50 of 26%)1. 
 
Of note, an ovarian cancer study applied massively parallel sequencing of 390  tumors and identified 
germline and somatic mutations not only in BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM, but also in 10 other homologous 
recombination genes (BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK1,  CHEK2, FAM175A, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, 
RAD51C and RAD51D) were associated with platinum response and 
survival8. If results from the proposed study are positive, we  propose to expand the eligibility to include 
mCRPC with loss of other DNA repair genes. 
 
If this study successfully demonstrates significan t responses to DNA damaging agents in this 
meaningful subset of patients with mCRPC, there would be clear rationale for follow up studies aimed 
at further disruption of DNA repair pathway. Po tential approaches would include chemotherapy 
followed by [CONTACT_796520], more intensive regimens of DNA damaging 
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098623] inactivation  
11  agents (anthracyclines with platinum) and/or immediate alternative effective chemotherapy regimens in 
treatment of an estimated 1 in 5 men with mCRPC.

5.3.3 Dose modifications for cumulative docetaxel or carboplatin toxicity 
 For all patients who respond to combined study treatment of docetaxel and carboplatin (as assessed by [CONTACT_43876], restaging 
scans, and/or clinical improvement), treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. To 
improve tolerability and allow the pati ent to continue in the event of t reatment response, the regimen may be 
modified per investigator discretion treatment in the follo wing ways: If there are cumulative toxicities (such as 
fatigue, myelosuppression, or neuropathy), doses of either docetaxel and/or carboplatin may be reduced (up to 
25%) and/or held (up to 6 weeks) OR patient may continue on single-agent carboplatin . If there is clinical 
response and cumulative toxicities to single agent carbop latin, doses may be reduced (up to 25%) and/or held 
(up to 6 weeks).
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098641]/Ethics Committ ee (IRB) approved, informed consent must be 
obtained from patients before any study specific pro cedures can occur. Confirmation of the patient’s 
informed consent and the informed consent process must also be documented in the patient’s medical 
record.

 The percentage of patients achieving ≥30% reduction in measurable disease by [CONTACT_393]. 
 Median time to tumor progression by [CONTACT_43877]2 criteria 
 
6.5.2 Statistical Methods: 
 
The proportion of patients with PSA  decline by 50% from baseline (PSA 50) will be evaluated. The 
primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of patients achieving PSA 50 with docetaxel and  
carboplatin. The historical comparison is a PSA50 of 26%. The target response rate is 60%.

All observed or volunteered adverse even ts regardless of causal relationship to study drug will be recorded on 
the adverse event page(s) of the case report form (CRF).
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098650] inactivation  
21  6.7.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE) 
 
An adverse event is defined in the Internati onal Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for 
Good Clinical Practice as “Any untoward medical occu rrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and whic h does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laborator y finding), symptom, diagnosis or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related 
to the medicinal product. For the purposes of this study, temporal association is defined 
as the time between the subject’s informed consent signature [CONTACT_10782] 28 days after the final dose of 
study medication. 
 
AEs further include worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches, 
gout, hypertension, etc.) which has incr eased in severity, frequency, or duration, or is associated with 
significantly worsened outcomes. 
 
The investigator or a medically licensed designee must pursue and obtain information adequate to 
determine the following: Grade (CTCAE v4.0), Causa lity (relationship to GC and/or rapamycin) and 
Outcome. The investigator’s assessment of Grade, any Intervention (medication, procedure, etc.), 
Causality and Outcome will be indicated by [CONTACT_796525] [INVESTIGATOR_796514]. For adverse events with  a causal relationship to the investigational 
product, follow-up by [CONTACT_796526] a level acceptable to the inve stigator, or his/her designated representative. 
 
Attribution is defined as the determination of wh ether an adverse event is related to a medical 
treatment or procedure. Attribution categories are as follows: 
 
 Unrelated: The adverse event is clearly NOT related to therapy 
 Unlikely: The adverse event is doubtfully related to therapy 
 Possible: The adverse event may be related to therapy 
 Probable: The adverse event is likely related to therapy 
 Definite: The adverse event is clearly related to therapy 
6.7.2 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) 
 
A noxious and unintended response to any dose of the drug (or biological) product for which there 
is a reasonable possibility that the product cau sed the response. ‘‘Reasonable possibility’’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relati onship between the drug and the adverse event. 
 Suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event (21 CFR 312.23). 
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098651] inactivation  
22  Suspected Unexpected Adverse Event Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is defined as an AE that is not consistent in 
nature, severity, or frequency with  the product information documented in the current package insert or 
in the protocol, consent form, and/or prior reports. 
 
If the investigator or designee determines that an AE meets the criteria for classification as a Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) or Suspected Unexpected  Adverse Event Reacti on (S[LOCATION_003]R), s/he will 
immediately notify the UW/FHCRC Cancer Consortium IRB, and FDA. See Section 6.7.3 for definition of SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs, a nd 6.7.6 for reporting guidelines. 
 
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (e.g., elec tive cosmetic surgery) or medical procedures that 
were planned before study enrollment are not considered adverse events. 
 
6.7.3 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is consider ed ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of the investigator or a 
medically licensed designee, it results  in any of the following outcomes: 
 
 Death; 
 a life-threatening adverse event; 
Life-threatening adverse event or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction . 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reacti on is considered ‘‘life-threatening’’ if its 
occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. This definition does not 
include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death; 
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_796515]; 
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substa ntial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions; 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 is a suspected transmission of infec tious agents by a medicinal product 
Important medical events that may not result in deat h, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition. Examples of such medical even ts include allergic bronc hospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the devel opment of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107263] “serious” is  any in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37350] a 
minimum of an overnight stay in a health care fac ility. Interventions for pret reatment conditions (e.g., 
elective cosmetic surgery) or me dical procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not 
considered SAE/S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purposes of th is study. Inpatient admission does not include 
admissions to rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_796516] s, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, routine 
emergency room admissions, same day surgery ( as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures) or 
social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep). 
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098652] inactivation  
23  6.7.6 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events 
 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all grade 3 and above non-serious adverse events (as 
defined in Section 6.7.1 and as further specified below) observed by [CONTACT_796527]. S ource documents may include the subjects’ medical 
records, patient diaries or study-specific worksheet s. Recording for all events should be done in a 
concise manner using standard, acceptable medical terms. 
 
The adverse event recorded should not be a proce dure or a clinical measurement (i.e., a laboratory 
value or vital sign) but should reflect the reas on for the procedure or the diagnosis based on the 
abnormal measurement. 
 
Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or frequency during the study should also be recorded (a 
preexisting condition that does not worsen is not an ad verse event). Further, a procedure or surgery is 
not an adverse event; rather, the event leading to th e procedure or surgery is considered an adverse 
event. Any event requiring unplanned in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496063] a subject’s 
participation in a trial must be repor ted as an SAE, as previously stated. 
 If, in the investigator’s judgment, a clinically significant worsening from baseline is observed in any 
laboratory or other test pa rameter (e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), angiogram), physical exam finding, or 
vital sign, a corresponding clinical adverse event should be recorded. 
 
If a specific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded as the 
adverse event, whenever possible. However, a complete description of the signs, symptoms and 
investigations which led to the di agnosis should be provided. For example, if clinically significant 
elevations of liver function tests are known to be secondary to hepatitis, “hepatitis” and not “elevated liver function tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not known, the abnormal test or finding should be recorded as an adverse event, using appropr iate medical terminology (e.g., thrombocytopenia, 
peripheral edema, QT prolongation). 
 
For these adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_325274] (e.g., study drug , other illness, progressive malignancy, etc.). The 
relationship of the adverse event to the inves tigational product will be assessed by [CONTACT_796528], “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_73639]?” The investigator should respond to  this question with either Yes or No. 
 
6.7.7 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Event (on-site SAEs) 
 
New SAEs will be collected and recorded throughout  the study period, from the signing of the informed 
consent through 28 days after the final dose of study treatment. Ongoing SAE/S[LOCATION_003]Rs with a causal relationship to the investigational product will be followed until the event or its sequelae resolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator or designee. 
 
6.7.[ADDRESS_1098653] 
be reported to the Cancer Consortium IRB (CC-IRB, fax [PHONE_2462]). AEs that are unexpected, possibly 
related to the study drug, and serious or suggest a risk of greater har m from the research then previously 
known will be reported to the IRB within 10 calendar days of the Investigator’s awareness of the event. 
 The Adverse Event Reporting Form is available online:

S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported on the Expedited Re porting Form for Unanticipated Problems or 
Noncompliance. Special Reporting Situations (SRS) will be reported to CC-IRB either immediately or 
at annual renewal, upon consultation with IRB staff.  The SAE, S[LOCATION_003]R or SRS should be recorded on 
the appropriate case report form (CRF). 
 
Reports of SAEs should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_458]. In the absence of the PI, 
reports should be signed a nd dated by [CONTACT_107316]. If s/he is not medically 
licensed, the report should also be signed by a licensed medical practitioner, preferably a sub-
investigator for this protocol. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_796517]. 
 
Each report should contain the following information: 
 
 Protocol number 
 Subject number 
 Disease/histology if applicable 
Date the event occurred 
 Description of the SAE 
 Relationship of the event to treatment or other causality 
 Whether the event was “expected’ 
 Severity of the event 
 Intervention 
 Outcome of the event 
 Detailed text that includes the following information: 
 An explanation of how the SAE was handled 
 A description of the patient’s condition 
 Indication whether the subject remains on study 
 Recommendation whether an amendment will need to be made to the protocol and/or 
the consent form. 
Relevant, redacted medical records should be provided as soon as they become available; autopsy reports 
should be provided for deaths if available. Determ ination of expectedness will be based on the contents 
of the current Investigator’s Brochure or package insert. 
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study b ecause of a serious adverse event, this information 
must be included in the End of Study Case Report Form as well as all SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R reports. 
 
6.7.[ADDRESS_1098655], considering all 
new available safety information r eceived during the reporting period. 
 
6.8 Criteria for Discontinuation of Study 
 The patient develops an unacceptable toxicity 
 Disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria 
 The patient develops a concurrent illness that is a contraindication to receiving further

 The patient elects to discontinue treatment or  withdraws consent. 
 At the discretion of the Investigator. 
 
6.9 Withdrawal from Study 
The investigator may withdraw a patient from any ph ase of the study for any of the following reasons. 
 
 Patient meets criteria for discontinuation of treatment. 
 Patient receives prohibited medications. I.e., concu rrent administration of other anticancer therapy, 
immunotherapy or investigational drug therapy given for any reason during study treatment Phase. 
 Patient withdraws consent. In this event, the reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented and 
clarification if withdrawal of consent includes follow-up phase for progression data collection. If a 
subject terminates the study early, an Earl y Termination visit will be performed. 
 
6.10 Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
 
Institutional support of trial monitoring will be in accordance with the FHCRC/University of Washington 
Cancer Consortium Institutional Data and Safety Mon itoring Plan. Under the provisions of this plan, 
FHCRC Clinical Research Support coordinates data and compliance monitoring c onducted by 
[CONTACT_51760], contract research organizations, or FHCRC employees unaffiliated with the conduct of the 
study. Independent monitoring visits occur at specified  intervals determined by [CONTACT_796529]. 
 
In addition, protocols are reviewed at least annua lly and as needed by [CONTACT_796530] (DSMC), FHCRC Scie ntific Review Committee (SRC) and the 
FHCRC/University of Washington Cancer Consortiu m Institutional Review Board (IRB). The review 
committees evaluate accrual, adverse events, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and adherence to the applicable data and safety monitoring plan for studies actively enrolling or treating patients. The IRB reviews the study 
progress and safety information to assess continued a cceptability of the risk-b enefit ratio for human 
subjects. Approval of committees as applicable  is necessary to continue the study. 
 The trial will comply with the standard guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_796531], state, and federal guidelines.

27  8.1 Determination of Sample Size 
The proportion of patients with PSA decline by 50% from baseline (PSA 50) will be evaluated. The 
primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of patients achieving PSA 50 with docetaxel and carboplatin. The 
historical comparison is a PSA 50 of 26%. The target response rate is 60%. The study will follow an 
optimal two-stage Simon design (Simon, 1989) where th e null hypothesis that the true PSA response rate 
(PSA decline by 50% from baseline) is 0.[ADDRESS_1098660] 
stage if the response rate is low. Ou r null and alternative hypotheses are H0: p ≤26% vs. H1: p ≥60%. The 
minimax 2-stage design for these parameters requires a first stage enrolling [ADDRESS_1098661] 5 
patients achieves a PSA 50 response, H0 cannot be rejected. If ≥[ADDRESS_1098662] completed the trial, and the response rate is calculated for all 
14 patients. If ≤[ADDRESS_1098663] a PSA 50 the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. This design will 
provide 80% power to detect a PSA 50 rate of 60% (one-sided α=0.05). This design also provides a 60% 
probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_223854] H0 is true, afford ing protection against treating more patients than 
necessary if the treatment is not effective.

30  APPENDIX 2 - ADVERSE EVENTS 
Definitions 
 
Adverse Event (AE) 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clini cal investigation subject administered a medicinal 
product and which does not necessarily have to have a cau sal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (inc luding an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a me dicinal product, whether or not related to the 
medicinal product. 
 
 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) 
A noxious and unintended response to any dose of the drug (or biological) product for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the product causes the r esponse. ‘‘Reasonable possibility’’ means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between th e drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty abou t causality than adverse reaction, which means any 
adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is  considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of the 
investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death, 
 a life-threatening adverse event, 
Life-threatening adverse event or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction . 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is c onsidered ‘‘life-threatening’’ if, in the view of 
the investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death. 
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions, or 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 is a suspected transmission of infectious agents by a medicinal product 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death,  be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34502], based upon appropriate me dical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical interven tion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasi as or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

31  APPENDIX 3 – PROGRESSION AND RESPONSE CRITERIA 
1. Antitumor Effect– Solid Tumors 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this st udy using the new international criteria proposed by 
[CONTACT_8225] (RECIST 1.1) Changes in only the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST 
1.[ADDRESS_1098669] their response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Participants w ho exhibit objective disease progression or die prior to the 
end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable. 
 
3. Disease Parameters 
 
Measurable disease (Target  Lesions) 
Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least  one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) 
as ≥ 10 mm (this requirement based on a CT slice thickness of ≤ 5 mm; for slice thicknesses > [ADDRESS_1098670] diameter ≥ 2 times the slice thickness). 
 
A lymph node will be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable if its short axis is ≥ 15 mm; the short axis should be measured and followed throughout. Nodes with a short axis 
≥ 10 mm and < 15 mm will be considered pathologica lly enlarged but nonmeasurable (see below). 
 
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions with identifiable soft-tissue components will be 
considered measurable if the soft- tissue component can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging (i.e., CT 
scan) and meets the general definition of measurability. 
 
Simple cysts will not be considered malignant lesions  and will be neither meas urable nor nonmeasurable. 
Cystic lesions believed to be metastases may be consid ered measurable if they meet the general definition 
of measurability, but noncystic lesions  are preferred as  target lesions. 
 
A lesion located in a previously irradiated area,  or in an area previously subjected to any 
locoregional therapy, will be considered meas urable only if there has been a documented 
increase in lesion size after prior treatment but prior to study entry. 
  
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098671] inactivation  
32  Non-measurable disease (Non-target Lesions) 
All other lesions including small lesions (longest diam eter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with a 
short axis of ≥ 10 mm and < 15 mm) and truly nonmeasurable lesions. 
 
Lesions considered to be truly nonmeasurable include the following: bone lesions; ascites; 
pleural/pericardial effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitic involvement of skin or l ung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_621857]. Blas tic bone lesions are nonmeasurable. 
 
 
4. Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metr ic notation, using a ruler, calipers, or digital 
measurement tool. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_1098672] of 
a treatment. 
 
Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case  of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
Chest x-ray. Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_92387] l ung; however, CT is preferable. 
 
Conventional CT and MRI . These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_1098673], abdomen, and pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of 
extremities usually require specific protocols.  
 
5. Response Criteria  
Overall tumor response, as defined in Table 11, will be based on an integration of the evaluation of 
target, non-target, and new lesions, as described below: 
 
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098674] inactivation  
33  5.1. Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  
The disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes 
reduced to < 10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR):  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any 
target lymph nodes), taking as refe rence the baseline sum diameter. 
 
Stable Disease (SD): 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameter since the treatment started 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest 
sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.) 
 
Not Evaluable (NE): 
A target lesion present at baseline which is subsequently not measured, or which is unable to be evaluated, leading to an inability to determine the st atus of that tumor for the time point in question. 
This category also includes scans that are not perform ed at this time point to evaluate the target 
lesion(s). The reason(s) explaining the absence of the evaluation or nonevaluable nature of the lesion(s) should be specified at the time of the assessment (e.g., early death due to malignant disease; early death due to toxicity; tumor assessments  not repeated or incomplete; other [specify]). 
 
Note : If tumor response data is missing, an overall assessme nt cannot be done. However, if there is missing or 
unevaluable data for non-target lesions, but data is availa ble for all target lesions, the overall response for that time 
point will be assigned based on the sum LD of all targ et lesions. Additionally, the assessment of CR cannot be 
made if there is missing or unevaluable data for non-ta rget lesions. In this case, the overall assessment would be 
PR.
9381 Docetaxel and Carboplatin for mCRPC with BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1098675] inactivation  
34  5.2. Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): 
The disappearance of all non-target lesions, the normalization of the tumor marker 
level (if tumor markers are measured and are initially above the upper limit of normal, those must normalize for a patient to  be considered in complete clinical 
response). All lymph nodes must be < 10 mm (short axis). 
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): 
The persistence of one or more non-target  lesions and/or the maintenance of the 
tumor marker level above normal limits. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): 
The appearance of one or more new le sions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non- target lesions. PD may be declared based on “unequivocal 
progression” in cases where the overall tumor burden increases significantly enough to require a change in therapy; in most case s, a modest increase in the size of one or 
more non-target lesions is not sufficient to qualify (especially in the presence of SD or PR in target disease). 
 
Unknown (UN): 
A nontarget lesion present at baseline which is  subsequently not measured, or which 
is unable to be evaluated, leading to an in ability to determine the status of that tumor 
for the time point in question. 
 
This category also includes scans that ar e not performed at this time point to 
evaluate the nontarget lesion(s). The reason(s) explaining the absence of the evaluation or nonevaluable nature of the l esion(s) should be specified at the time of 
the assessment (e.g., early death, maligna nt disease; early death, toxicity; tumor 
assessments not repeated or incomplete; other.) 
 
Note: Although a clear progression of "non-target " lesions only is exceptional, in 
such circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and the progression status should be confirmed later by [CONTACT_107331] 
(or Protocol Chair). Additionally, the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic 
origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment is mandatory to 
differentiate between stable or progressive disease status. 
6. Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
Each response parameter (target, non-ta rget, and new lesions) will be reported 
independently at each radiologic read. The investigator will decide of overall response 
based on the evaluation of target, non-target , and new lesions, as shown in Table 11 and 
Table 12.

a In general, if only a subset of  lesion measurements are taken at  a given assessment time point, the 
patient as a whole is considered not evaluable fo r that time point, unless a convincing argument can be 
made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point 
response.

a Non-CR/non-PD is preferred over stable disease for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used 
as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some tria ls. Thus, it is not advised to assign the category of 
SD when no lesions can be measured. Abbreviations: CR = complete res ponse; NE = nonevaluable or ineval uable; PD = progr essive disease 
 
7. Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of ove rall response is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first reco rded) until the first date that recurrence or PD is 
objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started. 
 
Duration of overall complete response: The dur ation of overall CR is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
 
36  Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest m easurements recorded since the treatment started. 
 
8. Progression-Free Survival 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the dura tion of time from start of treatment to time of 
objective disease progression.

ALYSIS PLAN

endpoint as compared to PTA alone. 
1.2 Analysis populations 
The analysis populations will be defined as follows for this study: 
• The ITT population will consist of all enrolled subjects who have signed the ICF and 
have been randomized. 
• The Modified ITT (MITT) population will consist of any subjects in the ITT 
population who are treated with the C OVERATM Vascular Covered Stent (following 
PTA) or PTA alone. 
• A Per-Protocol (PP) population may be created if there are subjects who have any 
major protocol deviations. The PP population will consist of any subjects in the MITT 
population who do not have any major protocol deviation. The protocol deviations 
that are c onsidered to have a “major” grade will be defined a priori in the analysis 
plan. 
All analyses including the primary analyses will be primarily based on the MITT 
population. PP analyses may also be performed for the primary endpoints. They will only 
serve as sensitivity analyses for the primary analyses which are based on the MITT 
population.  Additionally As-treated (AT) analysis may be performed in which subjects 
will be analyzed based on the actual treatment received instead of the randomized 
treatment, if there are subjects randomized but received the wrong treatment. 
1.3 Randomization 
The treatment randomization will be 1:1.

 1.[ADDRESS_741118] for treatment group, site and the interaction of treatment group 
and site. If the p-value for the interaction term is <0.15, it will be considered evidence of 
a possible significant interaction effect, and additional analyses will be performed to 
explore the differences between sites to assess their potential causes and whether or not 
they are clinically meaningful.  
For the primary safety endpoint, an analysis will be performed as well to examine the 
potential for interaction of site and treatment group. A logistic regression model will be 
fit that includes fixed effect for treatment group, site and the interaction of treatment 
group and site. If the p-value for the interaction term is <0.15, it will be considered 
evidence of a possible significant interaction effect, and additional analyses will be 
performed to explore the differences between sites to assess their potential causes and 
whether or not they are clinically meaningful.  
Both primary endpoints will also be presented by [CONTACT_13736] (US versus OUS). Similar 
analyses will be performed to examine the potential for interaction of geography and 
treatment group for both endpoints. A Cox regression model for the primary effectiveness 
endpoint and a logistic regression model for the primary safety endpoint will be fit that 
includes fixed effect for treatment group, geography and the interaction of treatment 
group and geography. If the p-value for the interaction term is <0.15, it will be considered 
evidence of a possible significant interaction effect, and additional analyses will be 
performed to explore the differences between geographies to assess their potential causes 
and whether or not they are clinically meaningful.

 1.5 Handling of Missing Da ta
 
Study endpoints may be missing due to withdrawal of consent , Investigator’s decision, 
LTF and subject death.  It is important to minimize missing data by [CONTACT_564168].  Missing data will be handled as described subsequently. 
The primary analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoint is a survival analysis.  As a 
sensitivity analysis, the primary safety endpoint will also be analyzed using survival 
analysis techniques.  In survival analyses, unobserved endpoints are a standard part of the 
analysis; they are known as “censored observations”.  As long as the censoring is 
unrelated to the treatment, this method of handling missing endpoints produces unbiased 
estimates of the freedom-from-event rates. In addition, as a sensitivity analysis, the 
primary effectiveness endpoint will be analyzed as a proportion-based binomial rate.   
For both primary endpoints, the reason  for the censoring of all subjects with missing 
endpoints will be reported.  If there is any indication that the censoring is related to the 
treatment group, a worst-case analysis may be performed for each primary endpoint, in 
addition to the standard analysis.  In a worst-case analysis, an event will be assumed to 
have occurred at the time the subject was censored for all such subjects in the Test group. 
In the Control group, all subjects with missing data will be assumed not to have had an 
event.  
In addition, regardless of whether missing data are related to the study intervention, a 
tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-point analysis will also be performed, in which assumptions about missing data 
are varied from worst-case to best-case to examine at what point the missing data would 
alter the results of the analysis.  
1.6 Sample Size Estimation  
The sample size is estimated to give adequate power on the two co-primary endpoints as 
well as for the key secondary endpoint. Sample size assumptions and determinations are 
summarized subsequently. 
1) Key Secondary Endpoin t – TLPP at 12 months: 
• Assumptions: 
o TLPP rate through 12 months for the study device treated subjects is 55%;  
o TLPP rate through 12 months for the PTA only treated subjects is 33%; 
o Allocation ratio: 1:1; 
o Attrition (drop-out) rate (by 12 months) = 15% 
o The Ty pe 1 error, α = 0.025 (one -sided); and 
o The Type 2 error, β = 0.10 (Power = 1 – β = 9 0%).  
• Sample Size: 
o 280 randomized subjects [238 evaluable] will give 90% power with one-sided 
type I error =0.025.

 2) Primary Effecti ve
ness Endpoint – TLPP at 6 months: 
• Assumptions: 
o TLPP rate through 6 months for the study device treated subjects is 73%; 
o TLPP rate through 6 months for the PTA only treated subjects is 50 %; 
o Allocation ratio: 1:1; 
o Attrition (drop-out) rate (by 6 months) = 10% 
o The Type 1 error, α = 0.025 (one -sided); and 
o The Type 2 error, β = 0.10 (Power = 1 – β = 95%).  
• Sample Size: 
o 280 randomized subjects [252 evaluable] will give 95% power with one-sided 
type I error =0.025. 
3) Primary Safety Endpoint – Safety at 30 days:  
• Assumptions: 
o The primary safety rate through 30 days in the study device treated subjects is 
95%; 
o The primary safety rate through 30 days in the PTA only treated subjects is 
95%; 
o Non- inferiority margin δ = 10%;  
o Allocation ratio: 1:1; 
o Attrition rate (by [CONTACT_4475] 30) = 5%; and 
o The Type 1 error, α = 0.025 ( one-sided). 
• Sample Size: 
o 280 randomized subjects [266 evaluable] will give 91% power with one-sided 
type I error =0.025. 
Hence, the sample size of 280 randomized subjects, allocated 1:1, for 140 subjects in the 
COVERATM Vascular Covered Stent  arm and 140 subjects in the PTA alone arm, will 
provide approximately 86% power for the both primary effectiveness and primary safety 
endpoint. The sample size of 280 randomized subjects, allocated 1:1 for 140 subjects in 
the C OVE RATM Vascular Covered Stent arm and 140 in the PTA alone arm, will provide 
approximately 90% power for the key secondary endpoint. 
1.7 Primary Endpoints

 1.7.[ADDRESS_741122] 
The primary effectiveness endpoint is TLPP through 6-months.  Objective: To 
assess if the [ADDRESS_741123] comparison.   
The primary effectiveness endpoint will be evaluated by [CONTACT_103368]:

with TLPP through t ≤ [ADDRESS_741124] index procedure is les s than or equal 
to that S 2(t) of PTA treatment group. 
H1: The (survival) rate S 1(t) of subjects in the study device treatment group 
with TLPP through t ≤ [ADDRESS_741125] index procedure is greater than that 
S2(t) of PTA treatment group. 
That is:

group will be provided.  
1.7.3 Primary Safety Endpoint 
The primary safety endpoint is proportion of subjects who are free from localized or 
systemic adverse events 
through 30 days that reasonably suggests the involvement 
of the AV access circuit (Refer to Section 4.1.2 for applicable definitions). 
1.7.[ADDRESS_741127]

ty rate p [ADDRESS_741129] index 
procedure is inferior to that p 2 of the PTA treatment group. 
H1: The primary safety rate p [ADDRESS_741130] index 
procedure is non-inferior to that p 2 of the PTA treatment group. 
That is:

H1: p 1  > p 2  - δ 
Where δ = 10% is t he non-inferiority margin, which is the range of difference that is 
considered not clinically important. 
Non-inferiority Farrington and Manning Exact Test will be used to test the primary 
safety hypothesis. The test is successful if the one-sided p-value is less than 0.025. 
In addition to the p-value of the test, the confidence intervals of the rate in each 
group and the difference between the two groups will be provided.   
1.8 Evaluation of Secondary Endpoints  
All secondary endpoints will be tested as exploratory only unless both primary 
hypotheses are successful. The testing of the secondary objectives will be performed in a 
hierarchical fashion in the order in which they are listed below. This means that as soon 
as a null hypothesis is not rejected , all further hypotheses will be tested for exploratory 
purpose only. This hierarchical testing scheme ensures that the study-wide Type 1 error 
rate remains at 0.05 when all of the s econdary endpoints are tested at α=0.[ADDRESS_741131]: TLPP at 12 Months

COVERATM Vascular Covered Stent and PTA alone groups.  A log-rank test will be 
used to test this hypothesis to determine if the C OVERATM Vascular Covered Stent is 
superior to PTA alone.  The test is successful if the two-sided p-value is less than 
0.[ADDRESS_741141], the confidence intervals of the rate in each group will be

Bmab 1200 Version 3.0/Final 
This document is confidential. Page [ADDRESS_250658] PASI 50 response by [CONTACT_10585] 12 will be rerandomized before 
receiving study treatment at Week 16. Before dosing at Week 16, patients in the 
Stelara®arm will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Bmab 1200 or 
Stelara®at Week 16. This is done to obtain data after a single switch in patients who 
have been treated with Stelara®. To maintain the study blinding, the patients in the 
original Bmab 1200 group will also go through the rerandomization procedure; 
however, they will be assigned and continue to receive Bmab 1200. The 
rerandomization will take place using the original strata used for the randomization 
at baseline. 
TP3 - From Week 28 dosing to Week 52:  All continuing patients who complete TP2 (receive study treatment at the baseline 
visit and Weeks 4 and 16) and achieve at least PASI 75 response at Week 28 will be 
offered to enter TP3 of the study to continue the same treatment they were 
rerandomized to receive during TP2 (Bmab 1200 or Stelara®) in a blinded manner.  
For patients not eligible to enter the TP3, the end of study visit will occur at Week 
28. 
 
During the double-blind, active-controlled treatment period, all randomized patients 
will be evaluated for efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity at 
scheduled visits per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). All assessments except 
for those related to the occurrence of injection site and hypersensitivity reactions 
will take place before the administration of study treatment at the baseline visit and 
Weeks 4, 16, 28, and 40. 
Efficacy assessments will include the clinician’s assessments of PASI, sPGA, BSA, 
and patient’s reported QoL measured by [CONTACT_148676] (see Table 1 for all the scheduled 
visits). Refer to Section 11  for more details on efficacy assessments. 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902] (AEs), 
injection site reactions and hypersensitivity, vital signs, physical examination, 
12 -lead ECG, and safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) at 
scheduled visits (see Table 1 for all the scheduled visits). Complete details on the 
safety and tolerability assessments are provided in Section 12.  
For the PK and immunogenicity assessments, blood samples will be collected at the 
Baseline visit (predose), Week 2, Week 4 (predose), Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 
(predose), Week 20, Week 28 (predose), Week 40 (predose), and Week 52. Serum 
levels of ustekinumab, as well as the presence and titer of ADAs and NAbs, will be 
evaluated for both the Bmab 1200 and Stelara® arms.  
All patients will have an end of study (EOS) visit at Week 52 for efficacy, safety, 
PK, and immunogenicity assessments as per the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ). 
Patients who discontinue study treatment before the end of Week 16 will be 
followed up for efficacy to the Week 16 scheduled assessment. However, the 
primary endpoint analysis will be done at Week 12 only. Patients who discontinue 
study treatment on or after Week 16 dosing and before the Week 28 dosing will be 
followed up for efficacy to the Week 28 scheduled assessment. Any patient that 
discontinues study treatment during TP1 or TP2 will be followed up for safety and 
immunogenicity to Week 28 and will then be discontinued from the study. Patients 
who discontinue study treatment on or after Week 28 dosing (ie, during TP3) will be 
followed up for efficacy, safety and immunogenicity to the EOS at Week 52.  
Every reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_209757]-up to obtain further safety information. Details regarding follow-up 
efforts are to be documented in the patient’s medical records/source documentation. 
Selection of Patients: Inclusion Criteria:

Bmab 1200 Version 3.0/Final 
This document is confidential. Page 12 of 103patientsincluding a dropout rate of 10% patients ensures a power of 85% with a two 
one-sided 5% level of significance.
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses: Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS software Version 9.4 or later (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC). Unless otherwise specified, continuous variables will be 
summarized using the mean, SD, median, minimum value, and maximum value, by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts 
and percentages by [CONTACT_1570]. Data will be listed in data listings. 
All CIs presented, except for the primary endpoint (percentage change from baseline 
in the PASI score) will be two-sided 95% CIs, unless otherwise specified. For the 
primary efficacy endpoint, a 90% CI will be presented, and equivalence will be 
established if the 90% CI falls entirely within the predefined margin of ±10%; this 
approach is equivalent to two one-sided tests (TOST) at the 5% significance level. 
Unless otherwise specified, analyses for TP1 will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] 
(Bmab 1200, Stelara®) up to predose Week 16. However, the primary endpoint 
analysis will be done at Week 12 only. Analyses for TP2 and TP3 will be presented 
by [CONTACT_209758] (Bmab 1200-Bmab 1200, Stelara®-Bmab 1200, Stelara®-
Stelara®).  
Analysis Sets: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS will consist of all patients who sign the ICF and 
are randomized into TP1. The FAS will be used for the primary analyses of efficacy. 
Per-Protocol Set (PPS): The PPS will consist of all patients in the FAS, who receive 
at least 2 study treatment administrations (Baseline and Week 4), and do not 
experience any important protocol deviations affecting primary efficacy at Week 12. 
The PPS will be used for supportive analyses of efficacy.  
Safety Set (SAF): The SAF will consist of all patients who receive at least one study 
treatment administration. The SAF will be used for analyzing safety and 
immunogenicity data during the treatment period. The SAF will be used for all 
analyses of safety and immunogenicity. 
PK Set (PKS): The PKS will consist of all patients who receive at least one full dose 
of study treatment and have at least [ADDRESS_250663]-treatment PK result before Week 16, 
excluding observations after relevant intercurrent events (ICEs) that may impact PK 
evaluations (eg, missing a dose, errors or deviations in dosing or receipt of other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_209732]). The PKS will be used for analyses of 
PK. 
Further analysis sets are proposed for the analyses of TP2 and TP3. See 
Section 15.2 . 
Efficacy Analysis: 
The statistical hypothesis associated with the primary efficacy analysis of the 
percentage change from baseline in the PASI score at Week 12 is: 
 H0: (µBmab 1200 - µStelara  -10%) or (µ Bmab 1200 - µStelara  +10%) 
 H1: -10% < µ  Bmab 1200 - µStelara < +10% 
where µ Bmab 1200 and µStelara denote the true mean percentage change from baseline in 
the PASI score at Week 12 for Bmab 1200 and Stelara®, respectively.   
The estimand framework will be applied for the primary efficacy endpoint, per 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9 addendum. ICEs are described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . The primary estimand is aligned with a treatment policy approach 
for all ICEs except death. The estimate of the treatment effect in this instance will be 
influenced by [CONTACT_209759], 
missing or early/late treatment, and/or premature discontinuation where a poor 
outcome may not be expected.

Bmab 1200 Version 3.0/Final 
This document is confidential. Page 14 of 103efficacy. The handling of estimands as detailed above will also only apply up to and 
including Week 16. After this point, data will only be analyzed as observed.
Safety Analysis:  
Safety data reported during TP1, TP2, and TP3 will be separately analyzed by 
[CONTACT_209760]2 and/or 
TP3, respectively.  
AEs will be classified according to the time of onset of the AE into pretreatment 
AEs, TEAEs and post-treatment-emergent AEs. All reported AEs will be coded 
using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) coding dictionary. An overall summary of incidence will be presented 
for TEAEs, treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), study treatment-
related TEAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs, TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment (Bmab 1200 
or Stelara®), and AESIs by [CONTACT_209761]/regimen. Additional 
summaries of these AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_11189] (SOC) 
and preferred term (PT), by [CONTACT_209761]/regimen. The clinical 
safety laboratory test values, vital signs, ECG parameter values, and physical 
examinations will be summarized by [CONTACT_209761]/regimen. For 
laboratory parameters and vital signs, original results and change from baseline will 
be summarized at each visit. Potentially clinically significant values will be flagged 
and summarized. 
PK Analysis:  
Serum concentrations of Bmab 1200 and Stelara®will be listed and descriptively 
summarized by [CONTACT_3148] (Bmab 1200, Stelara®) and visit for TP1 and by [CONTACT_108302] (Bmab 1200-Bmab 1200, Stelara®-Bmab 1200, Stelara®-Stelara®) and visit 
for TP2 and TP3. Descriptive statistics will include arithmetic and geometric mean, 
SD, coefficient of variation and geometric coefficient of variation, minimum, 
maximum, and median, plus percentage of concentration values below the lower 
limit of quantification. Additional subgroup analyses of PK data by [CONTACT_209762]. 
Immunogenicity Analysis:  
Incidence of ADAs to Bmab 1200 and Stelara®including titer and NAbs will be 
descriptively summarized at each time point and cumulative up to the time point by 
[CONTACT_3148] (Bmab 1200, Stelara®) for TP1 and by [CONTACT_71397] (Bmab 1200 
Bmab 1200, Stelara®-Bmab 1200, Stelara®-Stelara®) for TP2 and TP3. The titer 
values for positive ADA will be descriptively summarized.

5.1 Background on Plaque Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory condition that affects more than 8 million 
people in the [LOCATION_002] and approximately 125 million people (2% to 3% of the total 
population) worldwide.1 In Europe, the prevalence of psoriasis among adults varies 
geographically. In Southern and North Eastern Europe, 3% to 5% of the population are affected, 
compared to just over 1% of the population in the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]).[ADDRESS_250675] common type is plaque psoriasis, affecting 80% 
to 90% of patients. In individuals with lighter skin complexion, plaque psoriasis typi[INVESTIGATOR_209733], red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells or scale. On 
skin of color, the discoloration is darker and thicker, and more of a purple or grayish color or 
darker brown. These patches or plaques most often appear on the scalp, knees, elbows and lower 
back, and their size can range between 1 and >10 cm in diameter.3,4 Psoriasis may reduce 
physical and mental functioning, affects psychosocial functions, and also significantly affects 
health- related quality of life (QoL).5,6,[ADDRESS_250676], and various systemic biologic products. Biologic 
products work by [CONTACT_209763], including 
tumor necrosis factor al ) or various interleukin (IL) inhibitors. 
5.2 Background on Study Treatments 
5.2.1 Background on Bmab 1200 
Bmab 1200 is a fully human immunoglobulin G subunit 1 kappa ( ) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) that is being developed as a proposed biosimilar medicinal product to the reference 
product, Stelara®(ustekinumab) marketed by [CONTACT_209764]. Stelara® was originally 
approved in the European Union (EU) in January 2009 and in the [LOCATION_002] in September 
2009. Stelara®is indicated for the following conditions: moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, 
active psoriatic arthritis, and moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease and ulcerative 
colitis.8,9 
Bmab 1200 is of approximate molecular weight of 148 600 Daltons and composed of 
1326 amino acid residues with 2 identical heavy and light chains linked by [CONTACT_209765]-heavy and heavy-light chain interactions. All cysteine residues are 
involved in disulphide bonds resulting in a total of 16 disulphide bonds.

Bmab 1200 Version 3.0/Final 
This document is confidential. Page 23 of 103Physicochemical/analytical comparability evaluations have been done to show that Bmab 1200 is 
of similar quality profile as that of Stelara®. Details are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure

[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical Studies
Nonclinical Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamic studies conducted with Bmab 1200 included multiple assays for 
measuring Fab and Fc functionality such as p40 binding potency, neutralization of IL-12 induced 
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-4 activation, IL-12 and IL-23 binding, 
neutralization of IL-23 induced STAT-3 activation, neutralization of IL--V158 -
. 
These assays demonstrated that Bmab 1200 had potency comparable to US-Licensed Stelara® 
and EU-Approved Stelara® for the various batches analyzed. 
Toxicology 
No pharmacokinetic (PK), toxicokinetic (TK), antidrug antibody (ADA) evaluation and 
toxicology have been performed yet for Bmab 1200. 
Based on appropriate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EMEA guidelines as well as the 
feedback received from FDA type 2 meeting (Reference ID: 4796456) and EMA Scientific 
Advice (EMEA/H/SA/4410/1/2020/III) in vivo studies are deemed not necessary for the 
establishment of biosimilarity, as functional assays performed as a part of primary 
pharmacodynamics are highly sensitive in detecting differences between Bmab 1200, US-
Licensed Stelara® and EU-Approved Stelara®. 
A detailed description of nonclinical studies is provided in the IB.10 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Studies 
To date, [ADDRESS_250677] been initiated: 
 Study BM12H-NHV-01-G-01: A randomized, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel design study 
in healthy volunteers to evaluate the PK, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
Bmab 1200 after single subcutaneous injection (45 mg) in comparison with EU-approved 
Stelara® and US-licensed Stelara®. 
 Study BM12H-PSO-03-G-02 (present study): A randomized, double-blind, parallel 
group, multicenter, Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of Bmab 1200 and 
Stelara® in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
Information from clinical studies conducted with Stelara® in psoriasis is summarized in 
Section 5.2.2.

Bmab 1200 Version 3.0/Final 
This document is confidential. Page [ADDRESS_250678] Stelara® (ustekinumab)  
Ustekinumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin G subunit 1 kappa ( ) mAb 
that binds with specificity to the shared p40 protein subunit of human cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. 
These are naturally occurring proteins that regulate the immune system and immune-mediated 
inflammatory disorders. Ustekinumab inhibits the bioactivity of human IL-12 and IL-23 by 
[CONTACT_166187] p40 from binding to the IL-
immune cells. Ustekinumab cannot bind to IL-12 or IL-23 that is already bound to IL-
surface receptors. Thus, ustekinumab is not likely to contribute to complement- or 
antibody-mediated cytotoxicity of cells with IL-12 and/or IL-23 receptors. IL-12 and IL-23 are 
heterodimeric cytokines secreted by [CONTACT_209766], such as macrophages and 
dendritic cells, and both cytokines participate in immune functions. IL-12 stimulates natural 
killer (NK) cells and drives the differentiation of CD4+ T cells toward the T helper 1 cell (Th1) 
phenotype, IL-23 induces the T helper 17 cell (Th17) pathway. However, abnormal regulation of 
IL-12 and IL-23 has been associated with immune-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis and 
psoriatic arthritis. By [CONTACT_209767] p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, ustekinumab may exert 
its clinical effects in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis through interruption of the Th1 and Th17 
cytokine pathways, which are central to the pathology of these diseases.8,9 
In adult patients with plaque psoriasis, Stelara®is administered subcutaneously at an initial dose 
of 45 mg, followed by a dose of 45 mg after 4 weeks, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. For 
patients with a body weight of >100 kg, an initial dose of 90 mg is recommended because of 
better efficacy, followed by a dose of 90 mg after 4 weeks, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
The safety and efficacy of ustekinumab for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was 
assessed in 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled studies in patients 
who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy (PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2). In 
addition, a randomized, assessor-blind, and active-controlled study compared ustekinumab and 
etanercept in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who had an inadequate response 
to, intolerance to, or contraindication to cyclosporin, methotrexate, or psoralen and ultraviolet A.
Psoriasis Study 1 (PHOENIX 1) evaluated 766 patients. Patients randomized to ustekinumab 
received 45 mg or 90 mg doses at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by [CONTACT_209768] 12 weeks. 
Patients originally randomized to ustekinumab who achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
(PASI) (PASI 75) at both Weeks 28 and 40 were 
re-randomized to receive ustekinumab every 12 weeks or to receive placebo (ie, withdrawal of 
therapy). 
At Week 12, PASI 75 was achieved by 171 (67.1%) patients who received ustekinumab 45 mg 
and 170 (66.4%) patients who received ustekinumab 90 mg, as compared with 8 (3.1%) patients 
who received placebo (difference in response rate versus placebo 63.9%, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 57.8-70.1, P <0.0001 for 45 mg and 63.3%, 57.1-69.4, P  <0.0001 for 90 mg). At 
Week 40, long-term response had been achieved by 150 patients in the 45 mg group and 
172 patients in the 90 mg group. Of these, 162 patients were randomly assigned to maintenance

those receiving maintenance ustekinumab than in those withdrawn from treatment at Week 40 
(P <0.[ADDRESS_250680]).11
In a long-term study, initial clinical responses were generally maintained through Week 244 
(PASI 75: 63.4% and 72.0%; PASI improvement of 90% relative to baseline [PASI 90]: 39.7% 
and 49.0%; PASI improvement of 100% relative to baseline [PASI 100]: 21.6% and 26.4%) for 
patients receiving 45 mg and 90 mg, respectively. Similarly, PASI 75 responses were generally 
maintained among initial responders (79.1% [45 mg] and 80.8% [90 mg]) and partial responders 
(57.6% [45 mg] and 55.1% [90 mg]).12 
Psoriasis Study 2 (PHOENIX 2) evaluated [ADDRESS_250681] administration of study treatment. 
At Week 12, PASI 75 was achieved by 273 (66.7%) patients who received ustekinumab 45 mg 
and 311 (75.7%) patients who received ustekinumab 90 mg, as compared with 15 (3.7%) patients 
who received placebo (difference in response rate 63.1%, 95% CI 58.2-68.0, P <0.0001 for the 
45 mg group versus placebo and 72.0%, 67.5-76.5, P <0.0001 for the 90 mg group versus
placebo). More partial responders at Week 28 who received ustekinumab 90 mg every 8 weeks 
achieved PASI 75 at Week 52 than did those who continued to receive the same dose every 
12 weeks (22 [68.8%] versus 11 [33.3%]; difference in response rate 35.4%, 95% CI 12.7-58.1, 
P =0.004).13
Psoriasis Study 3 (ACCEPT) evaluated 903 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who 
inadequately responded to, were intolerant to, or had a contraindication to other systemic therapy 
and compared the efficacy of ustekinumab to etanercept and evaluated the safety of ustekinumab 
and etanercept. During the 12-week active-controlled portion of the study, patients were 
randomized to receive etanercept (50 mg twice a week), or ustekinumab 45 mg, or ustekinumab 
90 mg (at Weeks 0 and 4). 
At Week 12, PASI 75 was achieved by 67.5% of patients who received 45 mg of ustekinumab 
and 73.8% of patients who received 90 mg, as compared with 56.8% of those who received 
etanercept (P =0.01 and P <0.001, respectively). Similarly, 65.1% of patients who received 
45 mg of ustekinumab and 70.6% of patients who received 90 mg of ustekinumab had cleared or 
minimal disease according to the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA), as compared with 
49.0% of those who received etanercept (P <0.001 for both comparisons).[ADDRESS_250682] common adverse reactions (ADRs) (>5% of patients) of Stelara® reported in clinical 
trials were nasopharyngitis and headache, which were mild in severity and did not necessitate 
treatment discontinuation. The most common serious ADR was hypersensitivity including 
anaphylaxis.8,9Stelara® may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections 
including tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 6% to 12.4% of patients treated with Stelara® in 
psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical studies developed antibodies to ustekinumab, which were

to ustekinumab had neutralizing antibodies (NAbs).15 
5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of Bmab 1200
In this study, the therapeutic equivalence of Bmab 1200 versus Stelara®in patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be assessed. The nonclinical characterization of Bmab
1200 that supports its biosimilarity to Stelara® is the basis to also expect clinical comparability in 
terms of safety and efficacy of Bmab 1200 and Stelara®. 
The Bmab [ADDRESS_250683] the same pharmaceutical form and strength as Stelara® 
(45 mg/0.5 mL). The proposed dosing regimen is in line with the label of Stelara®.8,9
The proposed safety monitoring is deemed to be sufficient to monitor potential risks of 
Bmab 1200 administration. Patients deemed at a higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_209734]® or Bmab 1200, such as those with a prior history of cancer, active TB, or anaphylactic 
reactions will not be allowed to participate in the study as per eligibility criteria of current 
protocol and in agreement with the Warnings and Precautions of the reference product label. 
Patients with latent TB can enter the study only if they have completed or are receiving antibiotic 
prophylactic therapy for TB, and all enrolled patients will be closely monitored all along the 
study for potential signs and symptoms of TB. 
Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_73201], even if with some restrictions, is allowed in the course of the trial.
This trial does not include a placebo arm, 50% of enrolled patients will receive Stelara® while 
50% will receive Bmab 1200 for which there is an expectation of favorable efficacy and safety, 
even if not yet demonstrated. However, patients not responding to treatment at Week 12 (ie, not 
achieving PASI improvement of 50% relative to baseline [PASI 50]response) will not receive 
any further dosing with study treatment thus avoiding any further exposure to an ineffective drug 
as per psoriasis management guidelines. Based upon the clinical evidence as well as the proven 
safety profile of Stelara® and the above main aspects of the study design, the benefits of the 
conduct of the proposed clinical study outweigh the associated risks. Detailed information about 
the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) of 
Bmab 1200 and Stelara® is provided in the Bmab 1200 IB.10 
Given the current worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the potential 
risk for COVID-19 viral infection at the time and in the countries of this study, measures are 
implemented in this protocol to enable identification of patients who are likely to be infected to 
exclude them from enrollment or from subsequent study drug administration. Enrolled patients 
are required to comply with recommendation for individual protection from COVID-19 infection 
for the duration of the study. In addition, their condition will be closely monitored so that, in case 
of suspected infection, administration of study drug can be withhold and further examinations 
conducted as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. Such measures may need to be modified or 
implemented in accordance with the pandemic status, availability of a vaccine, relevant national 
guidelines, or recommendations from medical associations at the time of trial execution.

(Bmab 1200 or Stelara®)in a blinded manner. 
For patients not eligible to enter the TP3, the end of study visit will occur at Week 28. 
During the double-blind, active-controlled treatment period, all randomized patients will be 
evaluated for efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity at scheduled visits per the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). All assessments except for those related to occurrence of 
injection site and hypersensitivity reactions will take place before the administration of study 
treatment at the baseline visit and Weeks 4, 16, 28, and 40.  
Efficacy assessments will include the clinician’s assessments of PASI, sPGA, BSA, and patient’s 
reported QoL measured by [CONTACT_148676] (see Table 1 for all the scheduled visits). Refer to Section 11 
for more details on efficacy assessments. 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_42466], injection site reactions and 
hypersensitivity, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and safety laboratory tests 
(hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) at scheduled visits (see Table 1 for all the scheduled 
visits). Complete details on the safety and tolerability assessments are provided in Section 12. 
For the PK and immunogenicity assessments, blood samples will be collected at the baseline 
visit (predose), Week 2, Week 4 (predose), Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 (predose), Week 20, 
Week 28 (predose), Week 40 (predose), and Week 52. Serum levels of ustekinumab, as well as 
the presence and titer of ADAs and NAbs, will be evaluated for both the Bmab 1200 and 
Stelara® arms. 
All patients will havean end of study (EOS) visit at Week 52 for efficacy, safety, PK, and 
immunogenicity assessments as per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
Patients who discontinue study treatment before the end of Week 16 will be followed up for 
efficacy to the Week 16 scheduled assessment. However, the primary endpoint analysis will be 
done at Week 12 only. Patients who discontinue study treatment on or after Week 16 dosing and 
before the Week 28 dosing will be followed up for efficacy to the Week 28 scheduled 
assessment. Any patient that discontinues study treatment during TP1 or TP2 will be followed up 
for safety and immunogenicity to Week 28 and will then be discontinued from the study. Patients 
who discontinue study treatment on or after Week 28dosing (ie, during TP3)will be followed up 
for efficacy to the EOS at Week 52.  
Every reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_209769]-up to obtain further safety information. Details regarding follow-up efforts are to be 
documented in the patient’s medical records/source documentation.

those of the reference product (Stelara®). The study design accommodates for a singleswitch 
design, which allows for the assessment of any safety and immunogenicity or efficacy effects of 
a single transition from the reference product Stelara®to Bmab 1200 as required by [CONTACT_209770].
The doses of 45 mg and 90 mg ustekinumab based on patient’s body weight at enrollment have 
been selected for this study in accordance with the approved dosing recommendations of 
Stelara®. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percent improvement from baseline in the PASI 
score at Week 12. PASI score is a tool that has been widely used in the psoriasis clinical trials to 
determine the severity of disease and its improvement or worsening in the course of treatment. 
Although percent change of PASI from baseline was not the primary endpoint of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_209736]12H-PSO-03-G-02

This document is confidential. Page 34 of 103studies of Stelara® in psoriasis, it was a key secondary endpoint, and is deemed as a more 
sensitive and adequate endpoint for a therapeutic equivalence study. Percent improvement from 
baseline in PASI score will be assessed throughout the study to adequately monitor and compare 
the time course of the response to study treatment and its effects on the clinical signs and 
symptoms of plaque psoriasis. The additional efficacy end points (sPGA, BSA, DLQI) are those 
more commonly used in psoriasis clinical trials and also represent the main efficacy end points 
of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_209737]®studies. The physician global assessment chosen for this study is the same 
6-point sPGA that was employed in the Stelara®pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518].
Patients not achieving a minimal clinically significant response (PASI 50) after receiving 2 doses 
of study treatment (baseline visit and Week 4) will be withdrawn from the study treatment to be 
directed to different and more effective therapeutic options and to avoid exposing them to the 
risks of receiving further doses of ustekinumab without clinical benefit.  
Patients not achieving at least PASI 75 response after 3 doses of study treatment (baseline visit, 
Week 4, and Week 16), as measured at Week 28 visit, will not be offered to proceed with TP3 
and will not be dosed further nor continue until Week 52. Their end of study visit will be at 
Week 28. 
The potential immunogenic effects of Bmab 1200 in comparison with Stelara® will be evaluated 
over a 52-week period in parallel with measurement of ustekinumab serum concentration to be 
able to observe any potential relationship between ADA production, ustekinumab plasma drug 
levels, and efficacy measures. 
The study design, evaluations, and duration are considered adequate to support the objectives of 
the study, which is to assess similarity of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity between 
Bmab [ADDRESS_250685] fulfilled the requirements for study completion if/when the patient has 
completed all study periods, including the visit at Week 52, as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). For patients not entering the TP3, the end of study visit will occur at 
Week 28.  
The end of the study or study completion will be the last patient’s last visit for any protocol
related activity.

discontinue study treatment.
Study Discontinuation Reasons: 
1. Patient is lost to follow-up.
2. Patient withdraws consent from study participation. 
3. Death. 
4. Patient withdrawn at investigator’s discretionbecause of medical (eg, condition as 
assessed by [CONTACT_209773]/intervention that will interfere with the 
patient’s subsequent study visits) or administrative (eg, persistent noncompliance, 
inability to comply with the study schedule) reasons.
5. Study or site terminated by [CONTACT_2728]
6. Patient does not achieve at least PASI 75 response at Week 28.  
Additionally, the Sponsor may stop the study at any time for safety, regulatory, legal, or other

follow-up to obtain further safety information. Details regarding follow-up efforts are to be 
documented in the patient’s medical records/source documentation.  
If a patient terminates participation in the study and does not return for the 
completion/termination visit, their last recorded assessments shall remain recorded with their last 
visit. The reason for discontinuation will be recorded. In accordance with applicable regulatory 
guidance, de-identified data that have already been collected and incorporated in study database 
will continue to be used and/analyzed (and any identifiable data will be destroyed).
Patients who receive study treatment and withdraw from the study before its completion will not 
be replaced.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_250699] not receive any further 
doses of the study drug. The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring during 
the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In the event that a female patient or female 
partner of a male patient is subsequently found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study, any 
pregnancy will be followed up to term or as per the applicable local guidelines for follow-up, and 
the status of mother and child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery. A separate consent 
will be obtained from the pregnant partner before collecting any information pertaining to the 
pregnancy. See Section 12.8.5 for further reporting and monitoring details. 
The investigator should notify the Sponsor on a Pregnancy Reporting form within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the pregnancy. Full details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawal 
page (exit form) of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Pregnancy is not to be considered an 
AE; however, spontaneous miscarriages, congenital abnormalities, and any premature 
termination of pregnancy will be reported as serious adverse event (SAEs) as described in 
Section 12.8.5.

samples will be stored in compliance with the current applicable regulatory guidance at the 
clinical trial depot or warehouse. 
9.2 Method of Administration of Study Treatments 
Patients will receive either Bmab 1200 or Stelara® by [CONTACT_209776], Week 4, Week 16, Week 28, and Week 40 based on the patient’s baseline body 
weight as follows: 
 ® 45 mg (1 injection of 45 mg PFS)
 Patients who weigh >100 kg: Bmab 1200 or Stelara® 90 mg (2 injections of 45 mg PFS) 
Injection sites include upper arms, thighs, and abdomen. For patients who receive two 45 mg 
PFSs for a 90-mg dose, the 2 injections will be one right after the other at different injection 
sites. If possible, areas of the skin that show psoriasis lesions should be avoided as injection 
sites. The actual injection site(s) should be documented. 
Detailed administration instructions will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment Assignment and Blinding

At the baseline visit patients will be randomly assigned to receive Bmab 1200 (test product) or 
Stelara® (reference product) in a 1:1 allocation ratio (using a permuted block design), stratified 
by [CONTACT_209777]. A separate unblinded Biostatistical team will generate the 
randomization schedule using SAS software Version 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North 
Carolina) for RAVE EDC, which will link sequential patient randomization numbers to 
treatment codes. Based on the randomization schedule, each patient will be assigned a unique

This document is confidential. Page 46 of 103blinding from the primary packaging will not be feasible, but blinding will be maintained at the 
secondary packaging level with similar packaging for both the products. Therefore, 2 different 
teams, ie, blinded and unblinded team will be assigned to maintain the blinding and handle the 
study treatment administration. The designated, unblinded site staff will administer the study 
medication injections in such a manner that the participant remains blinded (eg, by [CONTACT_209778]). Blinded staff/any other personnel must not be involved in any 
activities pertaining to the receipt, handling, or administration of study medication. All study 
medication documentation (ie, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_18220], accountability logs, and RTSM randomization 
materials) must be maintained only by [CONTACT_209779]. Designated, unblinded personnel 
must be appropriately trained and certified (per country guidelines) to administer injections. 
Unblinded site staff should not share any treatment assignment information with others. 
No other study site personnel, patients, Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor designees will be 
unblinded to treatment assignment throughout the duration of the study unless unblinding is 
required. If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given patient’s study treatment, that patient 
will be discontinued from the study unless there are ethical reasons for that patient not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor’s medical monitor must be obtained in such instances. 
In the event that emergency unblinding is required for a given patient because of AEs or 
concerns for the patient’s safety or wellbeing, the investigator may break the randomization code 
for the patient via RAVE RTSM, by [CONTACT_190359]. The 
investigator should try every effort to discuss with medical monitor before the code break and 
the investigator is responsible for notifying the medical monitor and/or Sponsor of such an event 
as soon as possible. The unblinding and its cause will also be documented in the eCRF. 
In the event of drug-related, serious, unexpected AE (suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R]), Pharmacovigilance Group will be provided with the treatment assignment 
for the patient for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Details of the process are outlined in 
separate Safety Management Plan. 
Two database locks are planned for this study: one at the time of the Week 28 analysis and the 
other at the time of the Week 52 analysis. The study team will continue to remain blinded to the 
study treatments until the final analysis; a separate analysis team and reporting team will conduct 
the unblinded analyses for the Week 28 clinical study report (CSR) which will be described in 
detail in a separate document for the study.
9.[ADDRESS_250704] or other designated unblinded site staff will maintain records of study 
treatment delivered to the study site, the inventory at the study site, the distribution to each 
patient, and the return of materials to the Sponsor or designee for storage or disposal. These

Only patients enrolled in the study may receive the study treatment and only authorized site 
personnel may supply or administer the study treatment. Reasons for departure from the expected 
dispensing regimen must also be recorded. At the completion of the study, to satisfy regulatory 
requirements regarding drug accountability, all study treatments will be reconciled and retained 
or destroyed according to applicable regulations. Further guidance and information for the final 
disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the Study Reference Manual.
Treatment compliance will be evaluated by [CONTACT_209780]. 
A dose visit window of ±3 days is recommended for Week 4 dosing and ±7 days for the 
Week 16 and Week 40 dosing. For Week 28, a dose visit window is recommended to be ±7 days, 
however, a longer visit window may be considered only in cases where needed to ensure that the 
eligible patients are given opportunity to participate in TP3 (but dosing is not to be postponed to 
more than 4 weeks). Data handling for analysis of scheduled assessments performed outside of 
the allotted time window will be discussed and agreed on a by-patient basis in the Blinded Data 
Review Meetings (BDRMs), with the report finalized before each database lock.

EOS, End of Study visit: for patients not entering the TP3, EOS will occur at Week 28. Otherwise, EOS will occur at Week 52. 
Note: For all patients who discontinue study treatment early, every effort should be made to complete regularly scheduled study visits as recommended in 
Section 7.1 . Patients who discontinue study treatment before the end of Week 16 will be followed up for efficacy to the Week 16 scheduled assessment. However, 
the primary endpoint analysis will be done at Week 12 only. Patients who discontinue study treatment on or after Week 16 dosing and before Week 28 dosing 
will be followed up for efficacy to the Week 28 scheduled assessment. Any patient that discontinues study treatment during TP1 or TP2 will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity to Week 28 and will then be discontinued from the study. Patients who discontinue study treatment on or after Week 28 dosing (ie, 
during TP3) will be followed up for efficacy to the EOS at Week 52. Every reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_209769]-up to obtain further safety information. If a patient terminates participation in the study and does not return for the completion/termination visit, their last 
recorded assessments shall remain recorded with their last visit. Details regarding follow-up efforts are to be documented in the patient’s medical records/source documentation. 
a. Confirmation of eligibility (per applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria). 
b.For study treatmentadministration visits, procedures will be performed beforethe study treatment administration.

g. Additional vital signs including blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651], and body temperature (prior to the beginning of the study treatment 
administration and at least 1 hour after the end of the study treatment administration) will be monitored for possible hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, 
hypersensitivity will be monitored by [CONTACT_209781], including patient-reported signs and symptoms. In case of hypersensitivity, 
emergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_209745], oxygen, and artificial 
ventilation must be available; in addition, any types of ECG can be performed. Hypersensitivity that may occur after the administration of the study 
treatment will be monitored. If the patient experiences any hypersensitivity signs and symptoms outside study site, the patient can visit the study site for 
further assessment. Injection site reactions will be assessed at least 1 hour after the end of the study treatment administration. After the study visits, all 
patients will be instructed to report hypersensitivity or injection site reactions promptly to the study site; see Section 10.[ADDRESS_250711] dose administration for immunogenicity method validations.

(IEC)/institutional review board (IRB). Before performing any study-related procedures, the 
investigator (or designee) will obtain written ICF from the patient. 
In the event that rescreening occurs, the individual is required to sign a new ICF and must be 
assigned a new identification number.
All patients who are eligible and are willing to enter the TP3 are required to be re-consented as 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
10.2 Study Procedures 
Assessments and their timing are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). Section 12.5 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained. 
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatment unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). 
Efficacy assessments are described in Section 11 and include assessment of PASI score, sPGA, 
BSA, and DLQI. 
Safety assessments are described in Section 12 and include AE monitoring, injection site 
reactions and hypersensitivity, vital signs, physical examinations (complete and/or abbreviated), 
12-lead ECGs, laboratory results (routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis).
PK and immunogenicity assessments are described in Sections [ADDRESS_250715] procedures 
of the visit.
The investigator may, at his/her discretion, arrange for a patient to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow-up or are considered by [CONTACT_190370]. The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed.  
All patients will be required to remain at the study site for at least 1 hour after study treatment 
administration to monitor them for potential hypersensitivity reactions. Injection site will also be 
inspected for potential injection site reactions. Patients will be advised to promptly report to the 
study site any symptoms occurring within 24 hours after the study treatment that may be 
suggestive of hypersensitivity reaction.

home or remotely at the investigator’s discretion and according to local regulations even if 
limited study assessments could be performed. During this time, where access to study site is 
restricted, the study drug injections except the first dose, may be administered at the patient’s 
home by [CONTACT_209783]. All patients will be instructed to promptly report any 
hypersensitivity or injection site reactions to the study site. 
If a patient tests positive for COVID-19 during the study, he/she may be quarantined as needed 
and any affected scheduled visits can be arranged or skipped at the discretion of the investigator 
upon discussing with the medical monitor. Compliance with the permitted visit window should 
be applied at the best possibility. If the patient requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], an SAE should be 
reported and the patient should be followed up as outlined in Section 12.8.3. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, any potential measures or changes will be handled according to 
local regulations. If the COVID-19 pandemic wanes off, there is no need to amend the protocol in 
terms of any specific information relating to COVID-19, including whether some tests/procedures 
are no longer required.

The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing.  
11.1 Psoriasis Area Severity Index
The PASI is a quantitative rating score for measuring the severity of psoriatic lesions based on 
area coverage and plaque appearance and their response to therapy.16For the PASI assessment, 
the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs ( APPENDIX 2). 
Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration/thickness, and scaling, which 
are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4 based on severity of the lesion. Degree of involvement on each 
of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% 
involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is 
multiplied by [CONTACT_209784] a constant. 
The sum of all lesion scores can range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease), with the 
higher score indicating more severe disease. PASI scores are treated as a continuous score with 
0.1 increments and if any individual score is missing, the PASI score will not be calculated. reduction 
from baseline in the PASI score). 
11.2 Static Physician’s Global Assessment 
The sPGA is a quantitative rating score of the patient’s psoriasis based on physician’s assessment 
at a given time point according to the following categories: induration, erythema, and scaling 
(APPENDIX 3) . The sPGA is a 6-point scale and patient’s psoriasis is graded as clear(0), 
minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), marked (4), severe (5). The sum of the scores for induration, 
erythema, and scaling will be divided by 3 to obtain a final sPGA score. 
11.3 Body Surface Area
Total % BSA afflicted by [CONTACT_209785] a handprint of the patient at each visit 
as outlined in the schedule of events (Table 1). The entire palmar surface of the patient’s 
handprint is assumed to correspond to approximately 1% of total BSA.17,[ADDRESS_250717] of the disease 
on a patient’s QoL ( APPENDIX 4).19It is a 10-item patient-reported outcome questionnaire that, 
in addition to evaluating overall QoL, can be used to assess [ADDRESS_250718] 
QoL: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal 
relationships, and treatment. Nine of the [ADDRESS_250719] response categories including “not 
relevant” (score of 0), “not at all” (score of 0), “a little” (score of 1), “a lot” (score of 2) and 
“very much” (score of 3); Question 7 is a “yes”/ “no” question where “yes” is scored as 3. Eight 
items also have a “Not relevant” option scored “0,” which indicates no problems. Total scores

clinically important difference. If the answer to one question in a domain is missing, that domain 
is treated as missing. If 2 or more questions are left unanswered (missing), DLQI total score is 
treated as missing.

12.1 Medical History 
Medical history will be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the occurrence, 
signs, and symptoms of the patient’s pre-existing conditions, including all prior significant 
illnesses before screening. Additional pre-existingconditions present at the time when ICF is 
given and up to the time of first dosing are to be regarded as concomitant. Medical history will 
include alcohol consumption and smoking history, if applicable. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF in accordance with Section 12.8. All 
changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as 
clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
Additionally, demographic data will be collected for all patients and include date of birth or age 
according to applicable regulations, sex, race, and ethnicity. The demographic details will be 
recorded in the eCRF. 
12.[ADDRESS_250720] for the patient in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, 
television, cell phones). Vital sign measurements are to be taken before blood collection for 
laboratory tests. On the dosing day visits, vital signs will be assessed within 2 hours before 
dosing. 
Vital signs will be measured at scheduled visits as indicated in the schedule of events ( Table 1).  
Out-of-range blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the 
investigator’s discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements must be 
recorded as AEs. 
12.3 Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the cardiovascular, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. Height and weight will 
also be measured and recorded. The complete physical examination will be performed at 
screening only. Abbreviated, ie, sign/symptom-directed examination including weight will be 
performed at subsequent time points as specified in the schedule of events ( Table 1). 
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.

points specified in the schedule of events ( Table1); additional ECG recordings can be performed 
during study treatment administration or the 1-hourmonitoring for hypersensitivity reactions at 
the investigator’s discretion. If following the ECG review by [CONTACT_093], there are any ECG 
findings that would indicate any clinically significant cardiac abnormalities, the patient will be 
referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. The investigator will then report the event in the 
source documents and the eCRF. Regardless of the 12-lead ECG result, further evaluation with a 
cardiologist can be done at the investigator’s discretion.  
12.5 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory assessment samples ( Table 2) are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
Table 2. Laboratory assessment Clinical chemistry total protein, serum bilirubin (total, direct), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, blood urea

platelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit 
Urinalysis bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, leukocytes, nitrite, pH, protein, specific gravity, 
and urobilinogen 
Viral serology Hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests (see 
Section 12.5.2  for details) 
Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory facility.Any abnormal 
laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) including those that worsen 
from baseline and are clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the 
investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. For urine sample analysis, if there are any 
clinically significant abnormalities, a microscopic analysis will be performed. 
However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the underlying 
disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_166538]’s 
condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs. 
The investigator must review the laboratory reports, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study. If the laboratory reports are not 
transferred electronically, the values must be filed with the source information (including 
reference ranges). In most cases, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that

12.[ADDRESS_250723] 1 hour after the end of each 
dosing, as specified in the schedule of events ( Table 1). Severity of injection site reactions will 
be based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. 
Details will be recorded in both the source documents and the eCRF. 
12.[ADDRESS_250724] 1 hour after the end of the 
study treatment administration, as specified in the schedule of events ( Table 1) Emergency 
medication and equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_209746], oxygen, and artificial ventilation must be available at the 
study siteand any additional procedures like ECG recording as required can be performed. If 
patients have signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity/allergic reactions at home (hives, difficulty 
breathing, or swelling of face, eyes, lips, or mouth or any symptoms of cardiac origin), patients 
or caregivers should be advised to call the study site or get immediate help. 
For patients who experience or develop life-threatening treatment-related anaphylactic reactions, 
study treatment administration must be stopped and permanently discontinued. 
Details will be recorded in both the source documents and the eCRF.

relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Patients will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_209786]. 
A TEAE is defined as any event absent before exposure to the study treatment that emerges after 
first exposure to study treatment, or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or 
frequency after exposure to the study treatment.

and/or convenience admissions) would not be considered AEs. Laboratory results of the disease 
being studied, medical/surgical procedures are not an AE but rather the condition/event that leads 
to it are defined as an AE, details please refer to Sections 12.2 and 12.5. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events 
AEs will be assessed from the time the patient signs the ICF until the end of the study. 
If the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after the end of the study, 
and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study 
participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor/Sponsor representative.
At every study visit, patients will be asked a standard nonleading question to elicit any medically 
related changes in their wellbeing. 
In addition to patient observations, AEs identified from any study data (eg, laboratory values, 
physical examination findings, ECG changes) or identified from review of other documents that 
are relevant to patient safety will be documented on the AE page in the eCRF. The investigator 
can follow-up AEs by [CONTACT_209787]. Either unscheduled visits or follow-up calls need to be documented in the patient’s 
medical records and in the eCRF as appropriate. 
AEs will be recorded in the patient’s medical records in accordance with the investigator’s 
normal clinical practice and on the AE page of the eCRF. SAEs that occur during the study must 
be documented in the patient’s medical record, on the AE/SAE page of the eCRF. 
The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on the signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented 
as the AE (and SAE if serious) and not the individual signs/symptoms. If a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment meets the definition of an AE (and 
SAE if serious), then the AE/SAE page of the eCRF page must be completed as appropriate. A 
diagnosis, or clinical signs or symptoms if the diagnosis is unknown, rather than the clinically 
significant laboratory finding or abnormal assessment, should be used to complete the AE/SAE 
page. As additional information becomes available and a diagnosis is achieved, the 
signs/symptoms or abnormal finding verbatim should be updated on the eCRF. 
If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs or symptoms are not present, then the abnormal 
finding should be recorded on the AE/SAE page.

This document is confidential. Page 64 of [ZIP_CODE].[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity 
The severity of an AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the patient’s daily activities. 
The severity of the AE will be graded based on the CTCAE v5.0, based on the following general 
guidelines (a semicolon indicates “or” within each description). Any AEs not covered by [CONTACT_209788] : 
Grade 1: Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated 
Grade 2: Moderate: minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living* 
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily 
living** 
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5: Death related to AE 
Abbreviation: AE, adverse event. 
* Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc. 
** Self-care activities of daily living refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden. 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity. AEs characterized as intermittent do not require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The SAE will not be closed out if it is of changing severity during the course. It will be reported 
with changes in the severity as it upgrades in follow-up reports such that each upgraded sequela 
will not be recorded as a new SAE but continuation of same SAE and the serious and unexpected 
ADRs will be reported to the local regulatory authority/IEC within the stipulated timeline. Only 
the highest grade of severity will be considered for analysis purpose. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to the study treatment is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.
The investigator’s causality assessment should consider the potential etiologies for the observed 
AE. An AE may be related to study treatment, other concomitant medications, the underlying 
disease pathology, intercurrent illness, a procedure performed in the course of the study, or 
another reason. Among the potential etiologies, the investigator should decide based on the most 
likely causal relationship. When a causality assessment is provided for an SAE, it is important to 
include a rationale for the assessment so that a better understanding of the reported event can be 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602]. The rationale should be accompanied by [CONTACT_209789], including 
Biocon Biologics [LOCATION_006] Limited BM12H-PSO-03-G-02 
Bmab 1200 Version 3.0/Final 
This document is confidential. Page 65 of 103relevant laboratory tests, histopathology evaluations, and the results of other diagnostic 
procedures. 
The relationship or association of the study treatment in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized using the following:
UNRELATED: There is no temporal association between the investigational product and 
the reported event and event is clearly due to other causes (eg, concomitantmedication, 
underlying disease etc). 
 UNLIKELY: Time to drug intake makes a relationship improbable. Another explanation 
is more likely such as disease, environment, or other medication. 
 POSSIBLY: Treatment with the study drug caused or contributed to the AE, ie, the event 
follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration or follows a 
known response pattern to the study drug, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_209790]. 
 PROBABLY: A reasonable temporal sequence of the event with drug administration 
exists and, based upon the known pharmacological action of the drug, known or 
previously reported ADRs to the drug or class of drugs, or judgment based on the 
investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the event with the investigational 
product seems likely. The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction of the 
dose of investigational product. 
 DEFINITELY: A definite causal relationship exists between drug administration and the 
AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression/expression of disease state, or 
concurrent medication reaction) do not appear to explain the event. The event reappears 
or worsens if the investigational product is readministered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken with Study Treatment 
Action taken for an AE associated with the study treatment: 
Treatment interrupted The treatment was temporarily interrupted, with intent to restart 
Treatment withdrawn  The treatment was permanently discontinued 
Unknown Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused  
No action taken The AE did not result in any modification of dose or frequency of dosing  
Not applicable  The AE occurred before first dose or after last study dose  
Abbreviation: AE, adverse event. 
Note:  Dose increased, or dose reduced action taken can be evaluated on case to case basis as applicable. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome of Adverse Events 
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: 
 Recovered/resolved

*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than one AE is possibly 
related to the patient’s death, the fatal outcome should be indicated for the AE which is the most 
plausible cause of death in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. All other ongoing AE/SAEs will be 
recorded as not recovered/not resolved at the time of death. 
Note: Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained 
death should be reported as SAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Reporting 
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF. 
AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent 
medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used 
to code all AEs. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the patient is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the 
study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-Up of Patients Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed to 
satisfactory resolution, until the investigator deems the event to be chronic or not clinically 
significant, the event is considered to be stable, or the patient is lost to follow-up. 
The investigator will administer appropriate treatment for the AE/SAE resolution. The 
Investigator is responsible to ensure that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations as 
may be indicated to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or causality of the 
AE/SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
12.8.[ADDRESS_250727]
An AESI (serious or nonserious) is defined as an AE or SAE of scientific and medical concern 
specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_63405]/Sponsor representative could be appropriate 
(International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E2F; Council for International Organizations of

12.8.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any event that 
 results in death 
 is immediately life-threatening* 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]** 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
* The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.
**“Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” does not imply that the patient must have had an overnight stay in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the patient was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209747] a day for the purpose of 
treatment or observation, the definition of “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” is met, provided the patient 
is admitted solely for treatment of the event and not admitted for any other reasons including, 
rehabilitation, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677], respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief), skilled nursing facilities, nursing 
homes, social reasons, ease of compliance, day care procedures, or for medical or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553] (insurance reimbursement) purpose. Although, brief treatment in an outpatient clinic or 
emergency department does not constitute “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, depending on the 
intervention/treatment required for the event, it may satisfy the criteria of inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209748].

The sponsor/representative will notify the SAEs to other sites/investigators and will also submit 
periodic safety reports (eg, Development Safety Update Reports) as required by [CONTACT_209792]. 
Additional details for SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R reporting including periodic safety reporting are provided in 
the Safety Management Plan. 
Clarification in Reporting of Deaths 
All patient deaths (regardless of relationship to study treatment) should be reported for patients 
on the study, and recorded in the eCRF. If a patient dies after signing consent but before the first 
dose of the study treatment, this should also be recorded in the eCRF. Death is an outcome of an 
AE and not an AE in itself. All reports of patient death should include an AE term (other than 
“Death”) for the cause of the death. If an AE term is not provided, the investigator will be 
queried to obtain the cause of death. Only in the rare occurrence that no verbatim description of 
an AE can be obtained from the investigative site, will “Death-Unknown cause” be used as the 
event term.

determine outcome (including spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) and status of mother and child, even if the patient was discontinued from 
the study. Investigator should fill the Pregnancy Reporting Form and send to the 
Sponsor/Sponsor representative. Pregnancy follow-up should be recorded in the same form and

outcome. Refer Section APPENDIX 1 for details on collection of pregnancy information. 
If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a medical 
reason), the same should be reported using the same process as for SAEs as detailed under 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (in addition to the Pregnancy Reporting Form). Pregnancy complications and 
elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous 
miscarriages must be reported as an SAE. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, 
brought to the investigator’s attention after the patient has completed the study, and considered 
by [CONTACT_151772], must be promptly reported to the 
Sponsor. 
12.8.6 Overdose, Underdose, and Medication Error
Because study treatments are directly administered by [CONTACT_209793] a 
controlled manner, overdose/underdose/medication error is unlikely to occur. However, in case 
of overdose/underdose/medication error, the management will be as per the standard of care. In 
case there is overdose/underdose/ medication error, the same should be informed to the 
Sponsor/Sponsor representative safety team immediately (ie, within 24 hours). If 
overdose/underdose/medication error is associated with an AE/ SAE, AE/SAE reporting 
timelines (as applicable) to be followed. 
In case of overdose, underdose, or medication error, it is recommended that the patient be 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of ADRs and appropriate symptomatic treatment be 
instituted immediately.

antibiotic prophylactic therapy as per local guidelines (see Section 8.2 ). 
Throughout the study, patients will be monitored for the clinical signs and symptoms of TB. An 
additional IGRA or chest radiography may be performed at the investigator’s discretion based on 
the judgment per the signs and symptoms of TB monitoring. Patients with active TB based on 
the chest radiography result and/or the clinical signs and symptoms must be permanently 
discontinued from study treatment. 
If a patient is exposed to a person with active TB or to any condition increasing the risk of TB 
infection during the study period, an IGRA test will be conducted as soon as possible and prior to 
next administration of study treatment for those who had tested negative at screening. If the 
result of the IGRA is positive, patients will be referred to the clinician immediately to investigate 
the presence of active or latent TB based on medical history and any clinical signs and symptoms 
including chest radiography result. Even in the absence of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_209749], study 
treatment will be permanently discontinued.

This document is confidential. Page 76 of 103The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline 
in the PASI score at Week 12. Equivalence will be established if the 90% CI of the difference 
between the treatments (Bmab 1200, Stelara®) in the percentage change in the PASI score from 
baseline to Week 12 is within the equivalence margin of ±10%. Assuming that the treatments are 
equally effective and that the common SD of the percentage change from baseline in the PASI 
score at Week 12 is 30%, a total sample size of 384 patientsincluding a dropout rate of 10% 
patients ensures a power of 85% with a two one-sided 5% level of significance. 
15.2 Analysis Sets
The following analysis sets will be considered for analysis during TP1 (ie, before 
rerandomization at Week 16 for treatment switch) and throughout the whole study, where 
applicable: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  The FAS will consist of all patients who sign the ICF and are 
randomized into TP1. Patients in the FAS will be analyzed under the treatment as randomized. 
The FAS will be used for the primary analyses of efficacy. 
Per-Protocol Set (PPS):  The PPS will consist of all patients in the FAS, who receive at least 
2 study treatment administrations (Baseline and Week 4), and do not experience any important 
protocol deviations affecting primary efficacy at Week 12  (see Section 15.[ADDRESS_250736] of 
protocol deviations to be considered). Patients in the PPS will be analyzed under the treatment as 
randomized. The PPS will be used for supportive analyses of efficacy.  
Safety Set (SAF):  The SAF will consist of all patients who receive at least one study treatment 
administration. The SAF will be used for analyzing safety and immunogenicity data during the 
treatment period. Patients in the SAF will be analyzed under the treatment as actually received.

PK Set (PKS):  The PKS will consist of all patients who receive at least one full dose of study 
treatment and have at least [ADDRESS_250737]-treatment PK result before Week 16, excluding observations 
after relevant intercurrent events (ICEs) that may impact PK evaluations (eg, missing a dose, 
errors or deviations in dosing or receipt of other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_209732]). 
Patients in the PKS will be analyzed under the treatment as actually received. The PKS will be 
used for analyses of PK. 
The following analysis sets will be considered for analysis during TP2 (ie, after rerandomization 
at Week 16 for treatment switch up to Week 28) and TP3 (from Week 28 up to Week 52): 
FAS for TP2 (FAS2):  The FAS2 will consist of all patients who are rerandomized into TP2 at 
Week 16. Patients from the FAS2 will be analyzed under the treatment as randomized during 
TP2. The FAS2 will be used for the analyses of efficacy during TP2.

received during TP3. The PKS3 will be used for analyses of PK during TP3.
Assignment to all analysis sets, including decisions made on inclusion/exclusion for the PPS and 
other data handling issues will be agreed on and documented in BDRM, to occur (with report 
finalized) before each database lock. The assignment of the PPS will be finalized during the 
BDRM at the time of the Week 28 database lock. As such,the PPS will not be further reviewed 
during the BDRM at the time of the Week 52 database lock. 
15.3 Patient Disposition 
Patient disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_209761]/regimen and will 
include the number and percentage of patients achieving the following criteria: screened, screen 
failed, included and excluded from each analysis set (including reasons for exclusion), completed 
or prematurely discontinued study treatment for each period, and completed and prematurely 
discontinued the study, including reasons for discontinuation for both study treatment and the 
study. 
15.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be listed. Demographic and baseline 
characteristics (including, but not limited to sex, age, geographical region, race, height, body

This document is confidential. Page 83 of 103For analyses using MI, the analysis will be conducted on the complete dataset, for each 
imputation separately. Modelled results will be combined using Rubin’s rule (PROC 
MIANALYZE) for tabulation.
Additional subgroup analyses based on baseline characteristics will be presented with forest 
plots, as will analyses of primary efficacy based on ADA and NAbs positive/negative status up 
to Week 12. 
All inferential analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, including MI approaches will be 
conducted during TP1 only (ie, up to and including Week 16). However, primary analysis will be 
done at Week 12 only. During TP2 (Week [ADDRESS_250741] rerandomization through Week 28 predosing) 
and TP3 (Week 28 postdosing through Week 52), only descriptive analyses will be performed 
for efficacy. The handling of estimands as detailed above will also only apply up to and 
including Week 16. After this point, data will only be analyzed as observed. 
15.5.[ADDRESS_250742] to efficacy is “to assess the efficacy of Bmab 
1200 based on other efficacy parameters and time points over the study period as compared to 
Stelara®”. The estimands framework will apply for the following endpoints related to the 
secondary efficacy objective, for all visits up to and including Week 16 (ie, during TP1, or as 
otherwise stated): 
 PASI: 
o Percentage change from baseline in the PASI score at Weeks 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_250743] clear/minimal (PGA score of 0 or 1) at Weeks 4, 8, 
12, and 16. 
 Change from baseline in affected BSA at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. 
 Change from baseline in QoL as measured by [CONTACT_209795] 4, 8, 12, and 16. 
The same estimands (primary, secondary, and tertiary) as for the primary efficacy endpoint will 
be applied for the secondary efficacy endpoints related to PASI and sPGA. Where ICEs relating 
to deviations in study treatment are assessed, dosing up to Week4 willbe considered. 
For the secondary efficacy endpoints related to BSA and DLQI, a single primary estimand 
handling all ICEs with a treatment policy strategy will be applied. For this estimand, available 
data occurring on or after the ICE will be analyzed as observed (except remote visits, similar to 
the primary efficacy endpoint). Missing PASI assessment will be imputed by [CONTACT_209796] (see Section 15.9). 
Biocon Biologics [LOCATION_006] Limited BM12H-PSO-03-G-02 
Bmab 1200 Version 3.0/Final 
This document is confidential. Page 84 of 103Similar to the primary efficacy analyses, for the main analyses of the secondary efficacy 
endpoints, data obtained from remote visits will not be considered; the handling of such events as 
ICEs under the estimands framework will be discussed in the SAP. Sensitivity analyses, 
considering such data, may be added as appropriate.
No margins of equivalence are applied to secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints related to PASI will implement the same analysis 
method as that for the primary efficacy endpoint. Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints 
related to BSA and DLQI will be analyzed using mixed effect model for repeated measures 
(MMRM), similar to the sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. Binary secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusted for 
the randomization strata (region, body weight at baseline category, baseline psoriatic arthritis 
status, and previous biologic use). The estimate of the risk difference, with corresponding 
CMH-adjusted 2-sided 95% CI, will be presented. The validity of the CMH test, in particular 
with respect to the size of strata combination, will be reviewed. If small strata combinations cast 
doubt on the use of the CMH test, strata may be pooled, or a nonstratified test will be used. For 
analyses using MI, the analysis will be conducted on the complete dataset, for each imputation 
separately. Modelled results will be combined using Rubin’s rule (PROC MIANALYZE) for 
tabulation. 
Additionally, supportive analyses will be conducted for the endpoints related to PASI and sPGA 
for the primary, secondary, and tertiary estimands on the PPS. 
All time points up to Week 16 will also be analyzed descriptively for all efficacy measures on 
the FAS. For the secondary efficacy endpoints relating to TP2 (all scheduled visits after Week 16 
up to Week 28 predosing) and TP3 (all scheduled visits after Week 28 postdosing to Week 52), 
analyses will be purely descriptive, and the estimands framework (including ICEs) will not be 
applied. 
Subgroup analyses of secondary efficacy based on ADA status (positive versus negative up to 
Week 16, Week 28, and Week 52) and selected baseline characteristics may also be explored. 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted at least for the efficacy analyses of PASI. Further details of 
all analyses will be included in the SAP. 
15.6 Safety Analyses 
Safety data reported during TP1, TP2 and TP3 will be separately analyzed by [CONTACT_209797]2 and SAF3, respectively. No formal statistical 
comparisons are planned. Subgroup analyses of safety based on ADA status (positive versus 
negative up to Week 16, Week 28, and Week 52, or before start of AE) may also be explored for 
TEAEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_55366]. Further details of all analyses will be included in 
the SAP.

summarized. A listing will be produced showing all immunogenicity results for patients with any 
confirmed positive result. 
15.[ADDRESS_250746] for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, imputation will occur 
where specified. 
For determination of the primary efficacy endpoint analyses of percentage change in PASI score 
from baseline to Week 12, and other PASI related endpoints during TP1, an MIapproach for 
missing data will be employed where appropriate. For categorical analyses related to PASI score 
(ie, PASI-50, PASI-75, and PASI-90), imputation of the missing PASI score data will occur, and 
then the category will subsequently be derived. This will also apply prior to percentage 
calculation.  
Imputation of missing data for PASI score will occur as follows: Where a composite strategy is 
applied, a multiple imputed return-to-baseline approach will be implemented. The missing data 
will be imputed considering the stratification factors and only including the baseline PASI score. 
Randomized treatment group will not be considered for this imputation, as baseline response is 
irrespective of treatment group later assigned. 
Where missing data exists that is not affected by [CONTACT_209801] a composite or 
hypothetical strategy, the missing data will be imputed using an MAR approach, taking into 
account the treatment group as randomized, stratification factors, baseline PASI, any available 
PASI assessments and ICE indicators up to the visit to be imputed. 
Where missing data exists that is affected by [CONTACT_209802] a hypothetical strategy, the 
missing data will be imputed using a MNAR approach, including available data only from 
patients who do not experience any ICE up to and including the visit to be imputed. Imputation 
under these MNAR conditions will similarly take into account the treatment group as 
randomized, stratification factors, baseline PASI and any available PASI assessments up to the 
visit to be imputed. 
The number of imputations and the seed to be used, plus any further details required, will be 
detailed in the SAP. 
Biocon Biologics [LOCATION_006] Limited BM12H-PSO-03-G-02

to PASI score, unless otherwise stated. For these analyses, the respective baseline result will be 
included rather than PASI score at baseline as described above.
Further to the above, a nonresponderapproach will additionally be implemented for the primary 
estimand of binary secondary efficacy response endpoints (PASI-50, PASI-75, PASI-90, and 
sPGA response) as sensitivity analysis. 
15.10 Interim Analysis 
There is no interim analysis planned. Two database locks are planned for this study: one at the 
time of the Week 28 analysis and the other at the time of the Week 52 analysis. The study team 
will continue to remain blindedto the study treatments until the Week 52 analysis; a separate 
analysis team and reporting team will conduct the unblinded analyses for the Week 28 CSR 
which will be described in detail in a separate document for the study. 
Further details will be provided in the SAP.
15.11 Protocol Deviations Leading to Exclusion from the Per-Protocol Set 
Important protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PPS may include, but are not limited 
to: 
 Randomization criteria violations 
 Inclusion/exclusion criteria violations
 Inadequate compliance with study drug, including significant deviations from the study 
drug administration schedule 
 Prohibited medications taken
 No valid evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint 
 Other protocol deviations that could affect patients’ primary efficacy outcomes 
Protocol deviations affecting primary efficacy will be defined and reviewed in a standalone 
document during the BDRMs, to be held (with report finalized) before each database lock.The 
assignment of the PPS will be finalized during the BDRM at the time of the Week 28 database 
lock. As such, the PPS will not be further reviewed during the BDRM at the time of the Week 52 
database lock. 
15.12  COVID-19 
Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, per regulatory guidance, a listing of patients either 
experiencing COVID-19 or possibly affected by [CONTACT_4113]-19 related measures will be produced 
where applicable. As discussed above, the main analyses of estimands for the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on attended visits only, and remote assessment will 
not be considered. Details of handling of such events will be discussed in the SAP.

submitted in writing to the investigator’s IRB/IEC, along with any applicable changes to the ICF, 
for approval before patients can be enrolled into an amended protocol.
16.7.2 Protocol Deviations 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the procedures or 
processes approved by [CONTACT_1035]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_093]. An 
important deviation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol or to local regulations or 
ICH GCP guidelines that may result in a significant, additional risk to the patient or impacts the 
integrity of study data. Should a protocol deviation occur, the Sponsor must be informed as soon 
as possible. Protocol deviations and the reasons they occurred will be documented in the 
patient’s source documentation. Reporting of protocol deviations to the IEC/IRB and in 
accordance with applicable regulatory authority mandates is an investigator’s responsibility.
Protocol deviations listing will also be included in the CSR. 
The protocol deviations classification and management will be defined in a standalone document 
and reviewed before each database lock (see also Section 15.11 ).

16.9 Financing and Insurance
Before the study commences, the Sponsor (or its designee) and the investigator (or the 
institution, as applicable) will agree on costs necessary to perform the study. This agreement will 
be documented in a financial agreement that will be signed by [CONTACT_093] (or the institution 
signatory) and the Sponsor (or its designee). 
The investigator is required to have adequate current insurance to cover claims for negligence 
and/or malpractice. The Sponsor will provide no-exclusion insurance coverage for the clinical 
study as required by [CONTACT_2091]. 
16.10 Publication Policy/Disclosure of Data and Clinical Study Reporting 
After completion of the study, the data may be considered for reporting at a scientific meeting or 
for publication in a scientific journal. Two clinical study reports will be issued: one CSR (Week 
28 CSR for FDA) with the analyses up to Week 28, and anotherCSR (Week 52 CSR for other 
agencies like PMDA) with the analyses of data up to Week 52, as described in Section 15.10 .  In 
these cases, the Sponsor will be responsible for these activities and will work with the 
investigators to determine how the manuscript is written and edited, the number and order of 
authors, the publication to which it will be submitted, and other related issues. The Sponsor has 
final approval authority over all such issues. 
Data are the property of the Sponsor and cannot be published without prior authorization from 
the Sponsor, but data and publication thereof will not be unduly withheld. 
Whether the study is completed or prematurely terminated, the Sponsor will ensure that the final 
data are summarized and provided to the regulatory agency(ies) as required by [CONTACT_40006](s). The Sponsor will also ensure that the CSRs in marketing applications 
(as applicable) meet the standards of the ICH harmonized tripartite guideline E3: Structure and 
content of CSRs .

Definitions: 
Woman of Childbearing Potential 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before the first dose of study treatment, additional evaluation should be considered. 
Women in the following categories are not considered women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP): 
1. Premenarchal 
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
Documented hysterectomy 
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_209753], 
(eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to 
determine study entry. 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the patient’s medical records, 
medical examination, or medical history interview. 
3. Postmenopausal woman 
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for [ADDRESS_250754] discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.
Contraception Guidance: 
Fertile men and women of childbearing potential participating in heterosexual relations must be 
willing to use adequate contraception (i.e., [ADDRESS_250755] be a physical 
barrier method) throughout the study starting from screening and for at least [ADDRESS_250756] dose of study treatment; or must be sexually inactive by [CONTACT_209809], which is consistent with 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. 
Biocon Biologics [LOCATION_006] Limited BM12H-PSO-03-G-02 
Bmab 1200 Version 3.0/Final 
This document is confidential. Page 98 of 103Effective forms of contraception are a condom, an established form of hormonal contraception, a 
diaphragm or cervical/vault cap, or an intrauterine device. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Sterile men and women, postmenopausal women, and patients who have same-sex 
sexual relations do not have to use contraception. Sterile males and females must be surgically 
sterile for at least 6 months or postmenopausal (for females, amenorrhea duration for at least 
1 year). 
Collection of Pregnancy Information
Male Patients With Partners Who Become Pregnant 
 The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male patient’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male patient is in this study. This applies 
only to male patients who receive the study treatment. 
 If the investigator becomes aware of a pregnancy in a female partner of a male patient, 
the investigator should obtain a partner pregnancy informed consent form. Consent of the 
pregnant partner must be obtained before any details of the pregnancy can be shared with 
Sponsor/Sponsor representative. If the pregnant partner provides consent to have the 
pregnancy followed, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the pregnancy 
form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. 
The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
Sponsor/Sponsor representative. Follow-up of outcomes will be performed case-by-case 
basis if required, based on the local requirements. Any termination of the pregnancy will 
be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
the procedure. 
Female Patients Who Become Pregnant 
 The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. The initial information will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor/Sponsor representative within 24 hours of 
learning of a patient’s pregnancy.
 The patient will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator 
will collect follow-up information on the patient and the neonate and the information will 
be forwarded to the Sponsor/Sponsor representative. Follow-up of outcomes will be 
performed case-by-case basis if required, based on the local requirements. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.

This document is confidential. Page 99 of 103 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse 
event (SAE), any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for 
medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE.
A spontaneous abortion (occurring at <22 weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring 
at >22 weeks gestational age) is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such. 
 Any poststudy pregnancy-related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
treatment by [CONTACT_122723]/Sponsor representative as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting. 
 Any female patient who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue the study treatment or may be withdrawn from the study.

For the determination of static Physician’s Global Assessment, the degree of overall lesion 
severity will be evaluated using the categories below: 
Induration (I) (averaged over all lesions; use the National Psoriasis Foundation Reference card 
for measurement): 
0 = no evidence of plaque elevation 
1 = minimal plaque elevation, = 0.25 mm 
2 = mild plaque elevation, = 0.5 mm
3 = moderate plaque elevation, = 0.75 mm 
4 = marked plaque elevation, = 1 mm 
5 = severe plaque elevation, = 1.25 mm or more
Erythema (E) (averaged over all lesions): 
0 = no evidence of erythema, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_22765] 
1 = faint erythema 
2 = light red coloration 
3 = moderate red coloration 
4 = bright red coloration 
5 = dusky to deep red coloration 
Scaling (S) (averaged over all lesions): 
0 = no evidence of scaling 
1 = minimal; occasional fine scale over less than 5% of the lesion 
2 = mild; fine scale dominates 
3 = moderate; coarse scale predominates 
4 = marked; thick, nontenacious scale dominates 
5 = severe; very thick tenacious scale predominates 
Add I + E + S = / 3 = (Total Average) 
Physician’s Static Global Assessment based upon above Total Average: 0 = Cleared, except for residual discoloration
1 = Minimal - majority of lesions have individual scores for I + E + S / 3 that averages 1 
2 = Mild - majority of lesions have individual scores for I + E + S / 3 that averages 2 
3 = Moderate - majority of lesions have individual scores for I + E + S / 3 that averages 3 
4 = Marked - majority of lesions have individual scores for I + E + S / 3 that averages 4 
5 = Severe - majority of lesions have individual scores for I + E + S / 3 that averages 5
 1.50, score = 2.

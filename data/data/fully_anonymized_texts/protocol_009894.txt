1 INTRODUCTION AND  STUDY  DESIGN 
 
1.1 Background  
 
Electronic cigarettes fo r nicotine delivery  
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigar ettes) have proliferated at a rapid rate since their 
introduction into the US market in 2007 and their use as a form of  nicotine delivery 
far outpaced the science base (1, 2). Impor tant questions revolved around their 
abuse liability and safety. Although the design of these devices co ntinues to evolve, 
we have previously described nicotine intake, systemic retention, 
pharmacokinetics, and effects, as well as  vapi[INVESTIGATOR_158958]-administration 
of e-cigarettes (3, 4). We showed that e-cigarettes deliver as much nicotine from 
15 puffs as a typi[INVESTIGATOR_158959] (~1 mg), most of which is systemically retained, and the shape of the plasma nicotine concentration-time curve is also similar to tobacco cigarettes, except  that the maximum plasma nicotine 
concentration is, on average, lower for e-cigarettes. During ad libitum access, e- 
cigarettes were vaped intermittently in groups of 2-[ADDRESS_184537] ug (5). While marijuana has traditionally 
been combusted, currently vapi[INVESTIGATOR_158960] 
・-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  oil has been increasing (6). The latest national 
data show that 7.6% of cu rrent marijuana users (past 30 days) and 9.9% of ever 
marijuana users (lifetime) administered THC through a v aporizer or electronic 
device (6) (the study did not differentia te between vaporizers and electronic 
devices like e-cigarettes). The prevalenc e of vaped marijuana or THC is higher 
among younger adults. Prevalence of v aped marijuana/THC among 18-24 and 25- 
34 year-old ever marijuana users was 19.3% and 16.3%, respectively, compared 
to 8.8% for 35-49 year-olds and 5.7% for those 50 years and over (6). A recent 
study also showed high rates of cannabis vapi[INVESTIGATOR_66524] e-cigarettes among high 
school students (18.0% among ever e-cigarette users) (7). 
Combined effects of tobacco and marijuana.  
Page 6 of 30  The combined inhalation of tobacco and marijuana is common. Smoking of 
marijuana in a cigar wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (a blunt) is very popular among adolescents and 
young adults, particularly in the Afri can American population. Smoking of a 
combination of tobacco and marijuana in  cigarette form is also common, 
particularly in Europe (8) (9). Since bot h marijuana and tobacco are consumed by 
[CONTACT_158982][INVESTIGATOR_007], it is likely that vapi[INVESTIGATOR_158961]. Very 
little is known about the pharmacology and safety of simultaneous intake of nicotine 
and THC from vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
1.2 RESEARCH  QUESTIONS  
To understand THC pharmacology and safety of cannabis vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], including the 
pharmacology and safety of co-administration of nicotine and THC. 
 
1.3 SPECFIC  AIMS/OBJECTIVES  
1. To characterize Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) de livery, systemic exposure, 
and effects from vapi[INVESTIGATOR_158956]-containi ng cannabis leaf alone or cigarette 
tobacco alone, or the combination of cannabis and tobacco. 
 
2. To assess sympathetic nervous system (SNS ) stimulating and subjective SNS- 
related effects of THC alone compared to nicotine (tobacco) alone or combined to THC and nicotine co-administration. 
 
3. To assess emissions of THC, terpenes , and other compounds from electronic 
THC delivery devices. 
 
1.4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
1.4.1 Design Summary  
The study is designed as a within-subj ects single-blinded crossover study. 
Fourteen smokers of tobacco cigarette s and cannabis will switch between three 
conditions, namely: (a) vapi[INVESTIGATOR_158962] s leaf, (b) vapi[INVESTIGATOR_158963] (c) vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a combination of  cannabis leaf and tobacco containing 
nicotine. All participants will vape eac h product with t he PAX loose-leaf 
vaporizer. 
PAX vaporizers will be purchased by [CONTACT_158983]. The cannabis leaf will be 
obtained through the Nationa l Institute on Drug Abus e Drug Supply Program. 
The tobacco containing nicotine, used in conditions (b) and (c) will come from commercially available Marlboro brand cigar ettes. The same amount of cannabis 
or tobacco will be used in all conditions. 
Page [ADDRESS_184538] 
48 hours. The order of treat ment (cannabis leaf, tobacco  with nicotine, cannabis 
leaf & tobacco with nicotine) will be c ounterbalanced between subjects. Subjects 
will be blinded to the content of the v aporizer on the study day but will be told 
during screening that they will vape cannabis alone, t obacco alone, and cannabis 
plus tobacco with nicotine. 
1.4.2 Number  of Subjects  
A total of 14 subjects will be enrolled in this study over a period of about 6 
months. The anticipated accrual rate is approximately 2-4 subjects per month.

Page [ADDRESS_184549] to keep your confidentiality. There may be  
undiscovered drug toxicity associated with the us e of cannabis, that can put you at risk for 
unknown effects. There may be long-term effects associated with the use of cannabis that  
are currently unknown to the scientific community.  Can I answer any questions about risks?   Okay, let’s talk about the benefit s. There are no direct benefi ts to you, but you will be  
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_158967],  
which has great potent ial benefit to other smokers like you.  
 Here are some important reminders: You will be a sked to abstain from any type of cannabis  
use from 6pm (approximately 12 hours) prior to each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. This cannabis use  
includes smoking cannabis, vapi[INVESTIGATOR_158966], edi bles, THC concentrates, etc. You will also  
be asked to abstain from recreational drug use from  the time of orientation until the study is  
completed. You will be asked to abstain from the use of other tobacco  products that include  
cannabis for approximately 12 hour s prior to each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. This includes blunts  
and spliffs. You will be asked to abstain from  using any type of tobacco and nicotine  
products from 6pm (approximately 12 hours) prior to each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. This nicotine  
use includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, smok eless tobacco, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], cigars and cigarillos.  
 Please note that there are no guest are permitted at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l. This is to protect  
everyone’s confidentiality.   We will also be compensating you for your time and effort – if you comple te all parts of the 
study, you will receive a total of $[ADDRESS_184550] udy and it is estimated to take 4-6 weeks to receive it.  
 
Can I answer any other questions? (if yes, answer) (if no proceed)   Okay, can I ask you a few questions?  
Do you remember – how long does this study  last? (about 14 days) Do you remember – 
how many visits will you have? (5 visits)

3.3 SCREENING  VISIT PROCEDURES 
Subjects will undergo a 45 min Screening Visit to obtain and determine their 
enrollment eligibility. During this visi t, participants will complete a basic physical 
assessment (height, weight, heart rate , blood pressure, expi[INVESTIGATOR_33516], urine drug test, and pregnancy test  (if applicable), saliva collection, 
and questionnaires: the Severity of D ependence Scale, THC use history and a 
standard screening packet asking demogr aphics, health history and other 
product use. 
 
The CRC will determine initial el igibility via basic physical assessment, toxicology 
screen, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. In the event of a positive toxicology test 
(except marijuana), subject will be dism issed immediately without payment and 
the remainder of the screening visit measur es will not be completed. Participants 
who fail the pregnancy test, blood pressure  test, or BMI assessment will be paid 
and dismissed. Clinical Research Coordinator should follow the Tobacco 
Research Center Pregnancy Test SOP for communicating results with the 
participant. Participants who indicate an exclusionary medication that they 
Page 18 of 30  neglected to report during the initial REDCap survey, will be dismissed without
Page 19 of 30  payment. In all cases of early dismissal, any  collection of biosamples will be      
discarded. 
 
Upon determination of preliminary eligibil ity, the participant’s saliva sample will 
be delivered to the lab for analysis. Partic ipants must have saliva cotinine levels 
≥ 30 ng/mL to be considered eligible for enrollment. NicAlert tests will be used to 
verify cotinine in cases when saliva cotinine samples are not able to be run 
quickly.

questions to verify understanding. Consent will be obtained via participant’s and CRC’s sign[INVESTIGATOR_136]ure [INVESTIGATOR_136] t he conclusion of the PowerPoint  presentation. Two original 
consent documents will be signed by [CONTACT_33503] e participant and the CRC. One is to 
be filed and stored in the participant’s folder, another is to be given to the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158969]. The CRC will make a copy of one of 
those consent documents and give to the participants for his/her records. CRC 
should present participant with a copy of  their Bill of Rights as a research 
participant at UCSF. Participant will also be presented with the HIPAA 
authorization form to sign after an explanat ion of what it entails. The HIPPA form 
must have “entire medical record” c hecked off in Section B, information 
pertaining to drug & alcohol abuse checked off in Section C, and the optional 
activities of banking samples checked off & initialed in Section G.

3.[ADDRESS_184557] 48 hours bef ore Study Day 1. This visit will take 
approximately 30 - 45 minutes. The followi ng will happen during the Orientation 
Visit: 
• A urine sample will be collected and saved. 
• Participants will be asked to not use marijuana or marijuana-containing 
products for 12-hours prior to each study visit. 
• Participants will be asked to not use tobacco cigarettes or nicotine- 
containing products for 12-hours prior to each study visit. 
• Participants will be asked to not use any recreational drugs from that point 
until the study is completed.

3.4.2 Protocol  for Outpatient  Study 
3.4.1(a) Marijuana  preparation  
Cannabis leaf material (11. 7% THC) obtained from NIDA  will be stored frozen in a 
locked room in the Zuckerberg San Francis co General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78700]. When a 
participant is randomized, the pharmacy will dispense of 250 mg of cannabis (this 
includes a back-up supply of 125 mg). All c annabis will then be stored in the freezer 
compartment of the medication  refrigerator in the medica tion room of the Clinical 
Research Services Ward 5B. 
 
Cannabis material to be used by a study participant will be humidified 24-36 hours 
before use. Using a petri dish placed at the bottom of the des iccator, 2 centrifuge tubes, 
each filled with sodium chloride solution, will be emptied into the dish. Cannabis 
cigarettes will be placed on the desiccator pla tform and maintained at room temperature 
overnight, which is expected to raise the mois ture of the cannabis cigarettes by 3 to 5%. 
Cannabis material will be used within one h our after removal from the humidifier. 
 
3.4.1(b) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158971], the study co-I or CRC will meet  the participant to 
collect a urine sample for drug testing.  Only when it is confirmed that the 
participant is negative for all drugs other than cannabis, will we admit him/her on 
the research ward. 
 
Upon arrival at the research ward, the following proce dures will occur: 
1. Nurses will ask the participant when t hey last smoked, vaped, or used 
THC. 
 If the participant smoked cigarettes or vaped e-cigarettes after 10pm 
the night before either admission, they will be dismissed from the 
study. 
2. An expi[INVESTIGATOR_158972]. If their CO reading is greater

5 ADVERSE  EVENTS  & PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS  
 
5.[ADDRESS_184586] the study physician in case of 
any subsequent adverse events. If the subjects experience serious adverse 
effects, the research staff will evaluate this  with them and decide if they should be 
withdrawn from this study. 
 
5.2 DEFINITION  OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
5.2.1 Adverse  Event 
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered dr ug related. More specific ally, an adverse event can 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
Page 29 of 30  symptom, or disease temporally associ ated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality. An adverse event  can arise from any  use of the drug 
(e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
5.2.[ADDRESS_184587] ug caused the adverse event. For the 
purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonabl e possibility” indicates that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relati onship between the drug and the adverse 
event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction. 
 
5.2.4 Unexpected  Adverse  Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse r eaction is considered unexpected if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or listed in the consent form, or is not listed at the specificity or severity that  has been observed, or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or av ailable, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general invest igational plan or elsewhere in the 
current application. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definiti on, also refers to adverse events or 
suspected adverse reactions that are m entioned in the investigator brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as  anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not spec ifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation. 
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process 
are considered unexpected fo r the purposes of reporting because they would not 
be listed in the investigator  brochure. For example, a certain number of non-acute 
deaths in a cancer trial would be antic ipated as an outcome of the underlying 
disease, but such deaths would generally  not be listed as a suspected adverse 
reaction in the inve stigator brochure. 
Page [ADDRESS_184588] igator or sponsor, it resu lts in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening adverse event 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life function 
• Congenital anomal y/birth defect 
Important medical events that  may not result in death, are life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
5.2.6 Life‐threatening  Adverse  Events 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, 
in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it o ccurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
 
5.3 REPORTING  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
Reporting of serious adverse events will fo llow the current requirements of the 
Committee on Human Research (CHR). Specif ically, the following will be reported 
within five (5) working days of th e PI’s awareness, in writing: 
 All serious adverse events associated with the study procedures and/or 
 Any incidents or problems involving the conduct of the study or patient 
participation, including problems with the recrui tment and/or consent 
process. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a discussion of such 
events to the CHR on an annual basis during study renewal. 
 Any incidents or questionable adverse events are discussed at the weekly 
staff meetings with the PI. 
Page [ADDRESS_184589] adverse event  grading scale will be used to report any potential 
adverse advents from phl ebotomy, study drug, or  other study procedures: 
 1. Mild AE: did not require treatment 
 2. Moderate AE: resolved with treatment 
 3. Severe AE: resulted in inability to carryon normal activities and required 
profession medical attention 
 4. Life-threatening or disabling AE 
 5. Fatal AE 
 
The supervising study physician will be not ified of all grades [ADDRESS_184590]. Benowitz will be not ified of all grades 4 and 5 AEs. 
 
5.4 PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS  AND VIOLATIONS  
Protocol deviations are defined as an ev ent that deviates from the defined study 
protocol, but does not pose any risk to the pa rticipant or harm to the quality of the 
study data. For example, a follow-up call may be conducted outside of the 
stipulated window, or a section of questions on a questionnaire may be missed 
due to a mistake in branching. Deviations will be recorded on a protocol deviation 
sheet and reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_978]. 
 
Protocol violations are events that devia te from the defined study protocol, but 
put the participant at risk and/or cause ha rm to the study data. For example, if a 
participant was enrolled in the study but they were under the age of 12 or they 
were enrolled without consent of a parent. Protocol viol ations will be recorded on 
a protocol violation sheet, reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_158980].

psychoactive compounds; heart rate and blood pressure change; and subjective 
effects. 
Delivered and Retained Doses: Delivered THC and nicotine doses are estimated 
as the change in e-cigarette weight × conc entration of THC or nicotine in e-liquid. 
The amount of THC or nicotine systemically retained is estimated as delivered dose minus amount in gas traps. 
THC, 11-OH-THC, and Nico tine Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic parameters 
will be estimated from blood THC and 11-OH-THC and plasma nicotine 
concentrations using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.3 (Pharsight Cor poration, Mountain 
View, CA). Time to max concentration (T
max), max concentration (C max), and area 
under the blood/plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) will be estimated using a 
non-compartmental model and trapezoidal rule. C max, and AUC 0∞ will be adjusted 
for baseline nicotine levels. 
Averages and 95% confidence intervals will be computed by e-liquid type (THC 
only or 
Page 33 of 30  THC+nicotine). Although this study is not  hypothesis-driven, we will use mixed 
model analysis of variance (ANOVA) to a ssess differences in these variables 
between e-liquids type. Models will include sex as a covariate.

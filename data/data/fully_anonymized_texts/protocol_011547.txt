Protocol Title: Safety and efficacy of a contained electromechanical power morcellation systems 
for laparoscopic hysterectomy and myomectomy.  NCT#:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 Date : 4/11/2017 
 
Protocol Number: Pending. The study sponsor will be the Advanced Gynecologic Surgery Institute. The investigational site will be ALGH. The study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_858348] (IRB) per appropriate protocol.  
 
Objectives  
The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using an insufflated bag for electromechanical power morcellation during laparoscopic hysterectomy and myomectomy for tissue removal. Our goal is to prove that the integrity of the bags is maintained throughout and after insufflation and power morcellation.  
 
The hypothesis is that the bag will remain integral and there is will be no leakage from the  bag during 
and after power  morcellation  using  the described  contained  system,  confirming the safety  and efficacy 
of thesystems.  
 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion criteria will be adult premenopausal women (equal or greater than 18 years old) at ALGH without symptoms of menopause undergoing robotic or laparoscopic total or supracervical hysterectomies or myomectomies for the indication of symptomatic uterine fibroids who are not candidates for specimen removal via mini -laparotomy incision (as deemed by [CONTACT_858349]) or 
who have refused mini -laparotomy and therefore require power morcellation for tissue removal.  
 
Exclusion criteria include known or suspected malignancy, peri - or post -menopausal women 
diagnosed with uterine fibroids, specimen that can be removed without power morcellation (e.g., vaginally or through laparoscopic trocars), and adults unable to consent. These patients will be screened and consented pre- operatively. The final decision on a patient’s  
inclusion or exclusion from the study will occur intra -operatively after evaluation of the size and 
characteristics of the uterus.  
 
Study -Wide Number of Subjects  
As this will be a feasibility study, a maximum of 110 patients will be enrolled into the study. Over a one year time, the investigation group performs a total of 130 hysterectomies and myomectomies; therefore, we anticipate [ADDRESS_1196130] a laparoscopic or robotic - assisted 
hysterectomy or myomectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids at ALGH. The purpose, details, and consent for the study will be performed at that time. The study will then be re - discussed with the 
patients during the surgical consent process.  
 
Patients currently sign a consent form for morcellation per Advocate Health Care guidelines 
AHC IRB #6310  Version 4 – 
Page 2 of 13  
 (Attachment A). They also sign a separate consent for morcellation in a bag specifically developed 
by [CONTACT_858350] (Attachment B). The alternative provided in this consent is to convert to laparotomy. The subjects will sign the existing consents as well as the research consent to participate in the study.

 Procedures Involved  
The study will be a single center, prospective, observationalof the EcoSac 400 ECO t. Originally 
patients were going to be assigned to one of two arms to receive EcoSac 230 (Group 1) or EcoSac 400 ECO -T (Group 2). No random assignment method was to be utilized. Instead, the decision 
would have been at the surgeon’s discretion. Due to improved visualization with the EcoSac [ADDRESS_1196133] 
year, and undergo a saline -infused sonohysterogram and endometrial biopsy. Any patient with a 
fibroid that appears suspi[INVESTIGATOR_858334] (MRI) of their pelvis to further evaluate the fibroid.  
 
All patients undergoing potential morcellation of a fibroid uterus currently sign a consent pre - 
operatively allowing this process. They will also be consented for morcellation specifically in a specimen bag.  
The final evaluation and potential exclusion from the study with occur in the operating room. It will be based on the factors listed above. The alternative to morcellation is converting to laparotomy.  
 
EcoSac 400 ECO -T (EMP 400 ECO -T) 
Those patients consented and considered candidates for morcellation with the EcoSac [ADDRESS_1196134] technique. After removal of the uterus and/or fibroids, reconstruction of the uterus, and any additional necessary procedure and control of any bleeding, the morcellation portion of the procedure will take place.  
 
The Espi[INVESTIGATOR_858335] [ADDRESS_1196135] visualization, with the laparoscope placed through a lateral trocar. Once inside the 
abdomen, the specimen will be placed inside the bag. The accessory sleeve will be grasped through the right lateral 5 mm trocar and is pulled up through the abdominal wall until the entire sleeve is out 
and the opening to the sleeve is flush with the inside of the abdominal wall. The same 5 mm (non-  
bladed) trocar is  then replaced back into the abdomen through the sleeve so that it is entering into 
the bag. The string to close the bag will be pulled and the bag will be brought up through the umbilical incision after the trocar is removed while simultaneously providing tension on the right 
lateral arm to prevent slippage. The insufflation will be hooked up to the right lateral trocar and 
CO2 gas will be insufflated into the bag to a pressure of [ADDRESS_1196136] 
visualization inside the bag, the umbilical incision (where the 12 mm trocar was previously 
removed) will be dilated to [ADDRESS_1196137] visualization, assuring no damage to the bag. Once morcellation is complete, all small pi[INVESTIGATOR_858336] a spoon and removed. The inside of the bag will then 
AHC IRB #6310  Version 4 – 
Page 4 of 13  
 be irrigated allowing for removal of any small pi[INVESTIGATOR_858337]. 
 
After careful inspection to ensure all small pi[INVESTIGATOR_858338], one hundred milliliters of normal 
saline will be used to gather washings of the inside of the bag. We will perform a “washing” of the inside of the bag that pathology will evaluate for any retained fibroid pi[INVESTIGATOR_858339]. After performing the morcellation and removing the bag, we will place an albumin solution with blue dye inside of the bag to assess for any areas of leakage.  
 
This specimen will be sent for cytologic evaluation to evaluate for any smooth muscle cell clusters that may represents pi[INVESTIGATOR_858340]. We anticipate cytology to see inflammatory cells, reactive mesothelial cells, and rare red blood cells; but anticipate no smooth muscle cell clusters as we anticipate we will be able to remove all of the fibroid particles and pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]. The patient information will be sent via hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858341]. Although all small pi[INVESTIGATOR_858342], this will give assurance to the surgeon that all of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_858343].  
 
The CO [ADDRESS_1196138] protocol allowing insufflation of abdomen again to a pressure of 15mmHg. Any further portions of the procedure will be completed as needed.  
 
The integrity of the bag will be inspected. Once the bag is removed from the abdomen, it will be taken out of the operating room to the frozen section room. Five hundred milliliters of egg albumin (from egg whites) combined with 0.5 milliliters of methylene blue will be placed into the bag to assess for any leakage. The bag will be insufflated to a pressure of 25mmHg in a box trainer. A positive result with be documented if the egg albumin solution is present on the outside of the bag or drippi[INVESTIGATOR_858344]. In current testing with Espi[INVESTIGATOR_858345]., egg albumin has been shown to not leak through the EcoSac 400 ECO -T (EMP 400 ECO -T) (Attachment C). The size of 
egg albumin is approximately 5.5 nm with a gram molecular weight (GMW) of 45,000. Although a hydrogen atom (0.1 nm, GMW 1), water (0.2 nm, GMW 18), and DNA (2 nm) are smaller than egg albumin, viruses and cancer cells are much larger (24 -200 nm and 10,000- 30,000 nm, respectively) 
(Attachment D).  
Therefore, if egg albumin is unable to leak from the bag despi[INVESTIGATOR_858346], fibroid cells or 
potentially cancerous cells will also be unable to leak from the bag.  
 
The bag will then be disposed of in the normal post -operative manner in biohazard disposal 
bags. 
 
Pain will be assessed per routine measures using the VAS pain scale in the post -anesthesia care 
unit. Patients will then receive a follow up phone call by a member of the research team to  
assess pain using the same VAS pain scale at [ADDRESS_1196139] operatively.  
 
The Espi[INVESTIGATOR_858345]. EcoSac 400 ECO -T (product number EMP400ECO -T) is an 
investigational devise created to facilitate contained power morcellation. The bag is 
AHC IRB #6310  Version 4 – 
Page 5 of 13  
 made of Espi[INVESTIGATOR_858345].’s unique Superamide66TM fabric, which is 
Polyurethane coated “ripstop” nylon fabric. According to Espi[INVESTIGATOR_858345]., the 
strong ripstop nylon material prevents the bag from bursting or rupturing. The bag will be removed in its entirety after morcellation and no device will be left in the abdomen. The morcellation will only be completed if adequate insufflation of the bag is obtained leading to appropriate visualization. 
See attached for specifications of this device (Attachments E -K). 
 
To date, there has been no report of rupture or failure of proper use of the existing specimen 
bag. According to Espi[INVESTIGATOR_858345]., the strong ripstop nylon material it is made of 
prevents it from bursting or rupturing. The morcellation will only be completed if adequate insufflation of the bag is obtained leading to appropriate visualization.

Data will be collected and stored in an electronic and secure password protected spreadsheet. 
Access to this spreadsheet will only be given only to the study team. 
 
Data Management  
As this will be a feasibility study, a maximum of 110 patients will be enrolled into the study. 
Over a one year time period, the investigation group performs a total of 130 hysterectomies 
and myomectomies; therefore, we anticipate [ADDRESS_1196140] interim analysis, 
AHC IRB #6310  Version 4 – 
Page 6 of 13  
 the investigators will review the efficacy and safety data and will provide recommendations 
whether to stop or continue the study based on the interim efficacy and safety findings. If there is an egg -albumen leakage rate in >110% of cases or significant safety events in >20% 
of cases, we will stop the study. Significant safety events are defined as injury to surrounding organs, major bleeding >1,000mL, or need to convert to laparotomy due to bag use and morcellation.  
 
RESULTS/STATISTICS  
Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations or median and ranges) will be reported for all continuous variables (i.e. length of stay, age) based on their distribution and number and frequencies will be reported for all categorical variables (i.e. leiomyoma tissue or cells seen in abdominal and pelvic washings after isolated bag morcellation). Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk’s test of 
normality will be performed to assess the distribution of the continuous variables.  
 
Efficacy analysis will be performed and will included in the efficacy analysis. To confirm that 
the integrity of the bags is maintained throughout and after insufflation and power 
morcellation, safety analysis will be performed.  
 
The intention to treat population will be used for the evaluation of the primary endpoint. All 
patients who receive the procedure will be included in the efficacy analysis. 
 
Other exploratory / comparative analysis will be performed based on the number of patients with 
different characteristics. If comparative analyses are performed, Chi -square or Fisher’s Exact test 
will be used for categorical variables and Student t -test or Mann -Whitney U test will be performed 
for the continuous variables. All analyses will be performed using SPSS for Windows, version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A two- tailed p level of .05 will be considered statistically significant in all 
analyses.  
 
Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
The James R. & Helen D. Russell Institute for Research & Innovation (Russell Research Institute) located at ALGH, will assign an independent monitor who will have the experience and medical training necessary to review patient medical files and conduct 100% source data verification of the case report forms used for study data collection. Monitoring will be done regularly, but at minimum after each 8 patients enrolled and treated in the study. Following is the monitoring plan:  
• Provide onsite 100% Source Document  Verification  
• Monitor patient files on site in batches of 5- 8 patients/ visit and at a minimum of monthly 
intervals during patient enrollment  phase  
• Provide written data discrepancy/omission report to principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_307082] [ADDRESS_1196141]  
• Review  patient  data for protocol  violations  and expedite  reporting according  to FDA 
regulations  and IRB approval  requirement  
• Review  adverse events  to ensure  correct  attribution  of severity  and causality  and ensure 
timely  reporting according  to FDA  regulations  and IRB  approval  requirements  
 
Conduct and reporting during the study will comply with the IDE regulations US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 812, and Patient Protection regulations and IRB in [ADDRESS_1196142] of this study or subsequent publication and reporting of the data obtained during thisstudy. 
Records will be kept in accordance with 21 CFR  54.

Withdrawal of Subjects  
There is no anticipated voluntary withdrawal of subjects during the surgery. If, during the 
operation, it is decided that the specimen can be removed without morcellation, i.e. through the trocars or through the colpotomy, the patient will not be included in the study. Also, if the patient decides to withdraw from the study after the surgery, the patients’ data that has been collected will  
be included in the analysis but no further data will be gathered. No patients will undergo morcellation unnecessarily for the purpose of the study. 
 
Risks to Subjects  
There is minimal increased risk to subjects beyond the standard surgical risks with introduction and removal of foreign body products during laparoscopy as well as the risk of morcellation as explained in the “Background” section of the protocol. The patients would have the same risk whether or not they were participating in the study as all of the subjects are planned and consented surgical patients. No patients will undergo morcellation unnecessarily for the purpose of the study. The use of the bags will not increase the risk to the patients. See ‘Procedures Involved’ and ‘Withdrawal of Subjects’ for further information.  
 
There is a small potential risk of the bag tearing during morcellation leading to use of a foreign body without benefit of tissue containment. Were this to happen, a new bag would immediately be used and the abdomen and pelvis copi[INVESTIGATOR_653963]. There is also a potential for decreased visualization of surrounding organs while the bag is insufflated. However, there should not be a risk of trauma to these surrounding structures because we will only be operating inside the bag and will be able to visualize everything inside the bag.  
 
The egg albumin that will be used to test the bags will not be used in the patient. It will be used in the bag once the bag is outside the patient and in a different room. This will not pose any increased risk to the patient.  
 
Potential Benefits to Subjects  
The benefit to the subjects is to provide an isolated method of morcellation, and therefore further 
decreasing the risk of dissemination of fibroids and/or underlying undiagnosed malignancy.  
Proving that this method is successful, patients will continue to benefit from minimally invasive surgery without taking on the underlying risk of morcellation. 
 
Vulnerable Populations  
Not applicable. Only adult women that meet study’s inclusion criteria and are able to consent will participate in the study.  
 
Multi -Site Research  
Not applicable.  
 
Community -Based Participatory Research  
Not applicable.  
 
Sharing of Results with Subjects  
Findings will not routinely be made available to patients beyond the usual operative findings that are discussed with patients post operatively.

Recruitment Methods  
Subjects will be recruited pre -operatively at The Advanced Gynecologic Surgery Institute. The 
discussion will begin with the physician during the pre -operative planning appointment as an 
outpatient. Patients will be informed of the plan for morcellation and the current utilization of the 
isolation bag. They will also be informed of the alternative being laparotomy. The details, purpose and consent process for the study will be reviewed at this time. Subjects will then have this discussion again during the consent process in the pre -operative unit at their designated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
The discussion will be had with the surgeon/investigator and the consent will be reviewed at that time. There are no other advertisements about the study and there will be no payments to the subjects. Final decision regarding a patient’s inclusion in the study will occur in the operating room based on the evaluation of the patient’s umbilicus. 
 
Local Number of Subjects  
A maximum of [ADDRESS_1196144]. Records will be  
obtained from the CareConnection (electronic medical record) system as needed. The electronic 
spreadsheet will be de -identified before being sent to the Russell Research Institute for statistical 
analysis.  
 
Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
The subjects already are required to go through a consent process for morcellation and this consent currently describes the use of the isolation bag during morcellation. The subjects should feel no different with the consent for the project as they do now prior to their procedure.  
 
Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
There is no anticipated research -related injury as the research does not pose an increased risk to the 
subjects.  
 
Economic Burden to Subjects  
The subjects will not be responsible for any costs related to the research.  
 
Consent Process  
The subject will be informed of their potential participation in the study during their outpatient pre-operative evaluation. This takes place between [ADDRESS_1196145] consents for surgery and for morcellation will be obtained, as well as for participation in the study – i.e. consent for isolated bag morcellation.  
 
There will be time between the outpatient discussion of the consent and the pre -operative review of 
the consent. During this time, patients will be able to review the information further and ask any questions they may have.  
 
During the consent process, patients will be informed that if they wish to withdraw from the study,

(HRP -090) set forth by [CONTACT_858352].  
 
Non-English Speaking Subjects  
We are not anticipating non -English speaking subjects. However, if an eligible subject who is non-  
English speaking is presented; we will follow the Advocate IRB SOPs regarding Non-  English 
speaking subjects. If more than two (for one language) presents themselves as eligible subjects; we 
will at this time have the current IRB approved consent translated to that language for that patient population. 
 
Process to Document Consent in Writing  
The informed consent will be obtained in writing at the time of the normal pre -operative consent 
process (see above). Documentation of informed consent process will be done through a note in the chart or by [CONTACT_858353] (provided by [CONTACT_858354]).

Title of Study:  A Randomized, Multicenter, Double -Masked, Placebo -Controlled Study of the Safety 
and Efficacy of OmegaD Softgels in the Tr eatment of Dry Eye Disease  
Studied Period (Years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: September  [ADDRESS_338566] patient completed: May 2017 Phase of Development:  
3 
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  twice daily 
(BID) dosing of  OmegaD softgels  in the treatment of subjects with dry eye disease.  
Methodology: This will be a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled study. 
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for 84 days (12 weeks)  as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID  (2 softgels 5 – [ADDRESS_338567] and 2 softgels 5 –  10 minutes before dinner) for 84 days  
• Placebo softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID (2 softgels 5 – [ADDRESS_338568] and 2 softgels 5 –  10 minutes before dinner) for 84 days  
Comparisons of OmegaD softgels  to placebo will be double -masked; OmegaD softgels and placebo 
will be identical- appearing softgels.  
At Screening (Day -7 to Day -1), sites will obtain s igned informed consent, demographic information, 
medical/ocular and concomitant medication histories, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of 
childbearing potential only), conduct screening examinations (tear osmolarity testing, meibomian gland 
dysfunction grading, tear break -up time (TBUT), Schirmer’s test), and assess adverse events (AEs) . 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be reviewed.  
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the site at Baseline (Day 0) and the site 
will update concomitant medications and conduct baseline examinations  (Ocular Surface Disease Index 
(OSDI) questionnaire , tear osmolarity, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, slit lamp examination, 
TBUT) . Continuing eligibility for enrollment will require tear osmolarity ≥  312 mOsm/L and 
meibomian gland dysfunction as defined by a grade  of [ADDRESS_338569] one eye  at both  Screening and Baseline,  TBUT ≤  7 seconds in both eyes  at both Screening and 
Baseline , and the Schirmer’s test score from  Screening  must be  ≥ [ADDRESS_338570] be present in the same eye at both Screening 
and Baseline  if only one eye qualifies . After inclusion/exclusion criteria are review ed, the site will 
randomize eligible subjects.  The Omega -3 Index score will be assessed via fingerstick blood sample 
and site personnel will dispense study medication  and a daily study medication diary and assess AEs.  
Subjects will take 2 softgels twice da ily 5 to 10 minutes before a meal (ie, 2 softgels 5 – [ADDRESS_338571] and 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner). Daily reminders to take the medication 
will be provided, and subjects will document their compliance in terms of number of softg els taken in 
the study medication diary on a daily basis.

    Methodology (Continued):  
Each subject will return to the site at Day  42 (± 7 days) along with all unused study medication and the 
study medication diary  and site personnel will update concomitant m edications, conduct a slit lamp 
examination, dispense study medication, assess AEs, and perform study medication accountability  and 
diary review .  
Subjects will return to the site at Day  84 (± 7 days) , along with all unused study medication and the 
study m edication diary , for final safety and efficacy evaluations . Site personnel will update 
concomitant medications, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential), conduct 
all ophthalmic assessments as specified  in the Schedule  of Procedures,  the Omega -3 Index via 
fingerstick blood sample , assess AE s, and perform study medication accountability  and diary review .  
Both eyes will be assessed at each visit. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be 
documented from signing of informed con sent at Screening to Day 84.  
Number of Patients (Planned): Approximately 164 subjects are planned to be enrolled; 
approximately 82 subjects in each treatment arm at approximately 15 clinical sites ; however, when 
[ADDRESS_338572] completed treatment  a rev iew of treatment compliance will be conducted . If more than 
10% of subjects have protocol deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized  to achieve 
a study population in which  90% are compliant .

    Efficacy Assessments:  
Signs: TBUT, tear osmolarity, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, Schirmer’s test (anesthetized).  
Symptoms: OSDI questionnaire.  
Pharmacokinetics: Omega -[ADDRESS_338584]  
Safety Assessments: Safet y assessments will include slit -lamp examination, collection of AEs, and 
documentation of concomitant medicat ions.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint s:  
The primary  efficacy endpoints comprise a set of hypotheses that will be tested in a hierarchical 
fashion.  
• Mean change from baseline in TBUT in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84).  
• Mean change from  baseline in OSDI score at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
The differences between the 2 treatment groups will be tested with a significance level of 0.05. In order 
to control the Type I error rate these two endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order described above. If the null hypothesis for the TBUT  endpoint c an be rejected at P ≤ 0.05, the OSDI  endpoint 
will be tested at P ≤ 0.05.  
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint:  
• Proportion of subjects with meibomian gland dysfunction grade of 0 on both meibomian 
orifice  size and telangiectasia scales in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84).  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
• Mean change from baseline in tear osmolarity in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84).  
• Mean change from Screening in Schirmer’s test (anesthetized) score in the study eye at 
Visit  4 (Day 84).  
Safety Endpoint:  
• Incide nce of adverse events.  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Population:  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT): The ITT population will include all randomized subjects.  
• Per protocol (PP): The PP population will include all ITT subjects who remain in the study through Visit [ADDRESS_338585]

    Statistical Methods (Contin ued):  
Statistical Analyses:  
Analysis of TBUT , meibomian gland dysfunction, tear osmolarity, and Schirmer’s test  scores will 
utilize the designated study eye (worse eye at Baseline as defined by  [CONTACT_277357] ; if both eyes 
score equally  on TBUT , the eye with the higher tear osmolarity score will be chosen, and if still equal  
the right eye  will be the study eye ) to assess the significance of the differences between OmegaD and 
placebo. The unit of analysis for OSDI symptoms will be the subject.   
Statistical  significance for the comparison of means will utilize the t -test or analysis of covariance. 
Statistical significance for binary data will be assessed by a chi -square, Fisher's exact, or 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation or standard error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical 
variables (frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point. All summary tables will be 
supporte d with individual subject data listings.  
Sample Size:  
TBUT: A sample size of [ADDRESS_338586] 95% power to detect a difference in means of 
2.[ADDRESS_338587] with a 0.05 
two-sided significance level.   
OSDI:  A sample size of [ADDRESS_338588] approximately 95% power to detect a difference in 
means of 11.[ADDRESS_338589] completed treatment a review of treatment compliance will be conducted. If more than 10% of subjects have protocol deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized 
to achieve a study population in which 90% are comp liant.

   4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  Information  
Dry eye disease is a common multifactorial ophthalmologic disorder of the tears and ocular 
surface. Dry eye affects approximately 4.9 million people  (3.2 million women and 1.7 million 
men) 50 years and older in in the [LOCATION_002] (U S) (Schaumberg et al, 2003; Schaumberg et al, 
2009) . Inflammation is an integral component of this disease, as shown by [CONTACT_277358]  1 (IL -1), tumor necrosis 
factor  alpha (TNF -α) and matrix metalloproteinase  3 and 9 (MMP -3, MMP -9) (Pflugfelder, 
2004) . This is supported by [CONTACT_277359]® (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, 
0.05%), a drug that targets the immune system, is approved for the indication of increased tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular 
inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca  and effectively treats these symptoms  in 
some patients. The efficacy of Restasis is considered to be modest and ocular burning after 
instillation, the most common adverse reaction, sometimes limits patient compliance and leads to 
discontinuation of the drug . There is a clear medical need for more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
4.2. Rationale for the Development of OmegaD softgels  for the Treatment 
of Dry Eye  
Among alternative drug treatments for dry eye, oral treatment with omega -3 fatty acid 
supplements, in particular the marine omega -3s eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docos ahexaenoic acid (DHA) , appears to be promising. Essential fatty acids have been shown to 
diminish inflammatory responses in many human inflammatory diseases.  
EPA and DHA compete for the same enzymes as the omega -6 fatty acid,  arachidonic acid (AA ). 
As ome ga-3 levels increase relative to omega -6 levels , the competition for cyclooxygenase  and 
5-lipoxygenase suppresses AA synthesis of inflammatory mediators prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and 
leukotriene B 4 (LTB4) , and increases  EPA and DHA synthesis of  anti-inflamma tory (PGE 1) and 
weakly inflammatory (PGE3) mediators. This shifts the balance to a less inflammatory mixture  
of eicosanoids ( James et al, 2000 ). EPA and DHA supplementation also decrease s monocyte 
synthesis of cytokines TNF -α and IL -1β, with cytokine synthesis decreasing as cellular EPA 
concentrations increase ( Caughey et al, 1996) . More recently , EPA and DHA derivatives , 
resolvins  and protectins, have been shown to act to initiate the resolution of inflammation  by 
[CONTACT_277360] (Kohli and Levy, 2009 ).  
Because inflammation is a key component of dry eye disease and increasing the systemic levels of omega -[ADDRESS_338599] often 
increased tear break -up time ( TBUT ), with  increased Schirmer’s test scores and improved 
meibum characteristics reported by [CONTACT_223684] ( Bhargava et al, 2013 ; Kangari et al, 
2013; Kawakita et al, 2013 ; Macsai, 2008; Oleñik et al, 2013; Wojtowicz et al, 2011) .

   On the basis of the clinical development conducted by [CONTACT_277361] 
(PRN) with PRN Dry Eye Omega Benefits®, OmegaD is now developi[INVESTIGATOR_277350]. A 
randomized, masked clinical trial was conducted with 105 subjects with dry eye who were randomized to 4 Dry Eye Omega Benefits or placebo (safflower oil) softgels daily and treated for 
3 months. Statistically significantly decreased tear osmolarity and d ry eye Ocular Surface 
Disease Index (OSDI) symptoms, and significantly increased TBUT were observed for subjects 
who received Dry Eye Omega Benefits versus placebo ( Donnenfeld et al, 2015). The safety 
profile appeared to be satisfactory; 4 subjects in each  treatment group reported adverse events 
(AEs) (Omega Benefits 7.5%, placebo 8.0%). A ll the AEs reported for the Omega Benefits 
group were mild, these included stomach upset (2 subjects), diarrhea, headache, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], and flu. The stomac h upset reported for one subject and the diarrhea 
reported for another were considered possibly related to study drug. O megaD softgels is a  
formulation that is similar to Dry Eye Omega Benefits  with only slightly different amounts of 
EPA and DHA.  
Although numerous clinical studies have been conducted to study the efficacy of various doses 
and formulations of omega -[ADDRESS_338600] to Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA ) regulation  as food supplements, the FDA may not have reviewed the 
clinical data to support activity in dry eye disease . OmegaD LLC plans to conduct a clinical 
program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a controlled , pharmaceutical grade omega- 3 oral 
supplement for dry eye disease.  
4.3. Justification for Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Period  
The omega -3 daily dose to be utilized in OmegaD -2016- 001, 1680 mg of EPA and 560 mg of 
DHA,  is the same dose utilized in the PRN study  in which significant separation was observed 
between OmegaD and placebo in OSDI symptoms, TBUT, and tear osmolarity  (Donnenfeld et 
al, 2015) , and it appeared to be well tolerated based on the low number of AEs reported  
(unpublished data) . The daily amount of omega -3 in OmegaD is less than that present in Lovaza® 
capsules (1860 mg of EPA and 1500 mg of DHA), the FDA -approved EPA/DHA product  
indicated for the reduction of triglyceride levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, the safety of which was established in the clinical trials conducted in support of approval. The 
treatment period of 3 months is considered sufficient to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
OmegaD softgels and is a standar d study duration in trials of dry eye disease.  
4.4. Good Clinical Practices Statement  
This study  will be conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol, including all 
statements regarding confidentiality, and in compliance with International Conferenc e of 
Harmonis ation  (ICH) guidelines, and all appl icable US  federal r egulations and local legal and 
regulatory requirements.

   6. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This will be  a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo- controlled study. Subjects will 
be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for 84 days  (12 weeks ) as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID (2 softgels 5 – [ADDRESS_338604] and 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner) for 84 days  
• Placebo softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID (2 softgels 5 – [ADDRESS_338605] and 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner) for 84 days  
Comparisons of OmegaD softgels to placebo will be double -masked; OmegaD softgels and 
placebo will be identical -appearing softgels.  
At Screening (Day - 7 to Day - 1), sites will obtain signed informed consent, demographic 
information, medical/ocular and concomitant medication histories, perform a u rine pregnancy 
test (women of childbearing potential only) , conduct screening examinations (tear osmolarity 
testing, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, TBUT, Schirmer’s test), and  assess AEs.  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be reviewed.  
Subjects w ho meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the site at Baseline (Day 0) and 
the site will update concomitant medications and conduct baseline examinations beginning with the OSDI  questionnaire . Continuing eligibility for enrollment will require tear osmolarity 
≥ 312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland dysfunction grade [ADDRESS_338606] one eye at both Screening and Baseline , TBUT ≤ 7 seconds in both eyes  at 
both Screening and Baseline , and the Schirmer’s test score from  Screening  must be  ≥ [ADDRESS_338607] be present in 
the same eye at both Screening and Baseline  if only one eye qualifies . The study eye will be the 
worse eye at Baseline as defined by [CONTACT_277357]; if both eyes score equally on TBUT, the 
eye with the higher tear osmolarity score will be chosen, and if still equal, the right eye will be 
the study eye.  After inclusion/exclusion criteria are reviewed, the site will randomize eligible 
subjects.  The Omega -3 Index score will be assessed via fingerstick  blood sample  and site 
personnel will dispense study medication and a daily study medication diary  and assess AEs.  
Subjects will take 2 softgels twice daily 5 to 10 minutes befor e a meal ( ie, [ADDRESS_338608] and 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner). Daily reminders to 
take the medication will be provided, and subjects will document their compliance in terms of number of softgels taken in the study medication d iary on a daily basis.  
Each subject will return to the site at Day 42 (± 7 days) along with all unused study medication and the study medication diary and site personnel will update concomitant medications, conduct 
a slit- lamp examination, dispense study m edication, assess AEs, and perform study medication 
accountability  and diary review .  
Subjects will re turn to the site at Day 84 (±  7 days) , along with all unused study medication and 
the study medication diary , for final safety and efficacy evaluations . Site personnel will update 
concomitant medications, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential

   only), conduct all specified ophthalmic assessments, assess the Omega- 3 Index score via 
fingerstick blood sample, assess AEs, and perform stu dy medication accountability  and diary 
review . 
Both eyes will be assessed at each visit. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be 
documented from signing of informed consent at Screening to Day 84  
6.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately  164 subjects  are planned to be enrolled; approximately 82 subjects in each 
treatment arm at up to 15 clinical sites ; however, when [ADDRESS_338609] completed treatment a 
review of treatment compliance will be conducted. If more than 10% of subjects have protocol 
deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized to achieve a study population in 
which 90% are compliant.

8.2. Randomization and Masking  
Study medication will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (O megaD to placebo). A randomized block 
design will be used, and the randomization will be created by [CONTACT_46134]. 
If subjects meet eligibility criteria at Screening and at Baseline (see Section 7 for eligibility  
criteria), subjects will be randomly assigned to study medication at the Baseline visit. Clinical  
sites will assign the next subject kit, taken sequentially, from the lowest to the highest numbered 
kits from within each shipment of study medication. The drug kit randomization number will be 
recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
A supply of randomized study medication from the assigned kit sufficient to last until Day [ADDRESS_338616] at the Baseline visit; and at the Day [ADDRESS_338617]’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the 
investigator may obtain the tr eatment code for a given randomized subject  from the [ADDRESS_338618]’s study medication kit. The randomization code is to be obtained 
only if a medical emergency exists and knowledge of the medication being taken will influence the m edical management of the subject. In the event of emergency or life -threatening condition, 
the investigator may need to unmask the subject. The following procedure should be followed:  
1. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_277364] y before 
unmasking a subject, unless it is not possible to do so without risk to the subject. 
2. The Investigator should document the serious adverse event ( SAE ) and justification for 
unmasking in the Study Summary and C omments pages of the eCRF.  
3. The Subject  may continue to participate in the study at the Investigator’s discretion. If the 
subject is to be discontinued from study participation, then ALL procedures described in 
the Early Discontinuation Visit (Section 10.5) should be completed.

3 More than 1 vessel with vasodilation between 4 pairs of glands/orifices.  
4 More than 1 vessel with vasodilation between 4 pairs of glands/orifices with erythema of 
the tissue.  
A certain score on the telangiectasia scale is not required for study entry, nor is it an exclusion 
criterion . The telangiectasia and meibomian orifice size  scales will provide additional detailed 
information with which to track the progress /resolution of meibomian gland disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tear Break -Up Time  
A drop of Fluress® is added to the eye  and the patient may blink once to disperse it. Then while 
the subject avoids blinking , the tear film is observed under t he slit- lamp through a cobalt blue 
filter and timed until tiny dry spots develop. The procedure is conducted 3 times for each eye and 
the TBUT  for each is  measured in seconds and recorded in the e CRF.  The average for each eye 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_243840].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Schirmer’s Test (Anesthetized)  
An anesthetized Schirmer’s test will be performed to insure that only basal tear secretion is being measured  and to prevent tearing due to the irritation from the filter paper  (the eye s will already 
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -[ADDRESS_338630] been anesthetized  for the TBUT procedure). F ilter p aper strips will be placed in both eyes 
inside the lower eyelid (conjunctival sac) at the same time. The eyes are closed for 5 minutes. 
The paper is then removed and the amount of moisture on each strip in millimeters (mm) is 
measured and recorded in the e CRF.  
9.2.2. Symptoms  
The OSDI questionnaire (Appendix A ) will be provided to the study subject, who will be asked 
to circle the number that corresponds with the frequency of dry eye symptoms experienced over the past week. Site personnel will enter t he scores in the eCRF. The e DC system will 
automatically calculate the final score.  
9.3. Safety Assessments  
9.3.1. Slit-Lamp Examination  
A routine slit- lamp examination will be performed to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye, 
inclu ding lids, cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. Abnormalities will be 
documented.  
9.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
9.4.1. Omega -[ADDRESS_338631]

9.5. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
9.5.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject administered a study medication (pharmaceutical/biological product) that does not  necessarily have a causal 
relationship to this medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Study medication 
includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator product or vehicle placebo 
that is given during any phase of the study.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investig ational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant, or require therapy.  
The occur rence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_31463] -ended questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. At each clinic visit, study personnel should ask the following question: "Have 
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -[ADDRESS_338632] visit?” AEs also may be detected when  they are 
volunteered by [CONTACT_31464]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death, 
• Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term "life -threatening" refers t o an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (excluding 
progress ion/outcome of the disease under study);  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
• Is medically significant; ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the health of the 
subject o r may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not considered an SAE.  
All SAEs that are ongoing at the time of completion or discontinuation from the study will be 
followed until sta bilization (i.e., no other change in the condition is expected) or resolution of the 
event.  
9.6. Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of AEs to the study medication should be assessed by [CONTACT_31467]. 
Not suspected: The te mporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide 
a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Suspected: The temporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “suspected.”  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 34  
    If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by [CONTACT_277370] “suspected” the event will be considered to be related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting  (see Section 9.8) . 
9.7. Recording Adverse Events  
Advers e events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], regardless of severity or potential 
association with the study medication or study procedures, will be recorded in the e CRF . 
Clinically significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate should be reported as AEs ; 
however , Omega -[ADDRESS_338633] beneficial effects on blood pressure 
and heart rate. Only clinically significant changes (increase o r decrease)  in heart rate should be 
reported as AEs . All AEs that occur after a subject has signed the informed consent form  until 
the final study visit, Visit 4 ( Day 84) , should be collected and recorded on the AE e CRF  page. 
AEs that occur after informed consent is provided but before the first dose of study medication 
will be summarized  separately from AEs that occur from the first dose of double -masked 
treatment on Day 0 to the Day 84 visit . Serious adverse events will be followed until the event is 
resolved or stabilized. 
Medical conditions/diseases occurring before the first dose of study medication during Visit 1 
(Day  1) should be collected on the medical/ocular history pages of the e CRF . 
The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology w hen possible. For each AE, 
the Investigator will evaluate and report the following:  
• Onset (date and time);  
• Resolution (date and time);  
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe);  
• Relationship to study medication (not suspected, suspected);  
• Action taken (none, study medication temporarily interrupted, study medication 
permanently discontinued; concomitant medication taken; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; other); 
• Serious outcome (yes/no). 
The severity grade should be determined by [CONTACT_277371]. 
• Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activity  
• Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
It is impor tant to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(as defined directly above) whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468] [IP_ADDRESS] . 
An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_49850] a contraceptive medication.  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 35  
    The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study.  
9.8. Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from signing of informed consent  until the 
final study visit, Visit 3 ( Day 42), following the end of treatment exposure. Any SAEs 
“suspected” to be related to the investigational product and dis covered by [CONTACT_277372] .  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported to Oculos  within [ADDRESS_338634] should be maintained at the s ite with a copy emailed to 
OmegaD -safety @pointguardllc.com . The Investigator must assess the SAE relationship and 
complete the SAE form. Oculos  may request additional information. Follow -up information 
(e.g., discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be emailed to 
OmegaD -safety @ pointguardllc.com . 
In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF  page with the serious 
question marked “Yes”.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely basis as instructed by [CONTACT_277373]’s determination of causality.  
All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appr opriate 
diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event.  
Oculos will report all SAEs to the US FDA  on the appropriate schedule depending if the event is 
drug related or not drug related, expected, unexpected (based on the available information in the 
Investigator’s Brochure ). 
Any death occurring during the study and follow up period should be reported as an SAE. For 
any death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to study 
drug, the SAE resulti ng in the death must be reported to Oculos . A death occurring after 
completion of the study  at Visit 4 (Day 84 ) does not require completion of the SAE form.

    11. STATISTICS  
11.1. General Considerations  
This is a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of BID dosing of OmegaD softgels  for 84 days  (12 weeks ) in the treatment of 
subjects with dry eye disease.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 rat io as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels  (N = 82  subjects); 2 softgels BID  
• Placebo softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID  
A biostatistician will perform statistical analyses as agreed with the Sponsor acc ording to the 
Statistical Analysis Plan. Any additional or supplemental data analysis performed independently 
by [CONTACT_277374].  
Efficacy analysis will be conducted on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population and on the per 
protocol (PP) population. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis population. Definitions for all of the analysis populations can be found in Section 11.3. 
The study eye will be the worse of qualifying eyes at Baseline as defi ned by [CONTACT_277357]; 
if both eyes score equally  on TBUT , the eye with the higher tear osmolarity  score will be chosen, 
and if still equal the right eye will be the study eye . 
11.2. Handling of Missing Data  
The planned statistical methods use all available data. To account for the presence of missing 
data, multiple imputation may be used for ITT anal yses on the primary endpoints. Multiple 
imputation will be carried out using the SAS procedures.  
11.3. Determination of Sample Size  
TBUT: A sample size of [ADDRESS_338643] 95% power to detect a difference in means 
of 2.[ADDRESS_338644] 
with a 0.05 two- sided significance level.  
OSDI: A sample size of [ADDRESS_338645] approximately 95%  power to detect a 
difference in means of 11. [ADDRESS_338646] completed treatment a review of treatment compliance will be condu cted. 
If more than 10% of subjects have protocol deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized to achieve a study population in which 90% are complian t.

    11.4. Analysis Populations  
11.4.1. Populations for Efficacy Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intent -to-Treat Population  
The ITT population is defined as  all randomized subjects. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed on the  ITT population. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Per Protocol Population  
The PP population will include all ITT subjects who remain in the study through Visit [ADDRESS_338647] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT analysis 
population; however, shoul d there be a reasonable difference in the size of the ITT and safety 
analysis populations, demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for both. The comparability of groups used in comparison analyses will be characterized in tables of demo graphic data. Summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
11.6. Efficacy Analysis  
Primary e fficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. A nalysis of TBUT , 
meibomian gland dysfunction, tear osmolarity, and Schirmer’s test s cores will utilize the 
designated study eye (worse eye at Baseline as defined by [CONTACT_277375] ; if both eyes score 
equally  on TBUT the eye with the higher tear osmolarity  score will be chosen , and if still equal 
the right eye  will be the study eye ) to assess the significance of the differences between OmegaD  
and placebo. The unit of analysis for OSDI symptoms will be the subject.  
Statistical significance for the comparison of means will utilize the t- test or analysis of 
covariance. Statistical significance fo r binary data will be assessed by a chi -square, Fisher's 
exact, or Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation or standard error of the mean, median, maxim um, and minimum) and 
categorical variables (frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point. All summary 
tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.

    11.6.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The primary efficacy endpoints comprise a set of hyp otheses that will be tested in a hierarchical 
fashion. 
• TBUT in the study eye  
• OSDI score  
The differences between the 2 treatment groups will be tested with a significance level of 0.05. 
In order to control the Type I error rate these two endpoints will be t ested sequentially in the 
order described above. If the null hypothesis for the TBUT endpoint can be rejected at P   ≤ 0.05, 
OSDI endpoint will be tested at  P ≤ 0.05.  
11.6.2. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint  
• Proportion of subjects with meibomian gland dysfunction grade of 0 on both meibomian orifice  size and telangiectasia scales in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84).  
11.6.3. Secondary Ef ficacy Endpoint s 
• Mean change from baseline in tear osmolarity in the study eye  at Visit 4 (Day 84) . 
• Mean change from Screening in Schirmer’s test (anesthetized) score in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84).  
11.7. Safety Analyses 
Safety data will be presented in tables of descriptive statistics and frequency distribution. All 
summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.

Evaluating the OSDI©Score1
The OSDI©is assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater disability.
The index demonstrates sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between normal subjects and
patients with dry eye disease. The OSDI©is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring dry eye 
disease severity (normal, mild to moderate, and severe) and effect on vision-related function.
Assessing Your Patient’s Dry Eye Disease1,2
Use your answers D and E from Side 1 to compare the sum of scores for all questionsanswered (D) and the number of questions answered (E) with the chart below. *
Find where your patient’s score would fall. Match the corresponding shade of red to the key below to determine whether your patient’s score indicates normal, mild, moderate, or severe dry eye disease.

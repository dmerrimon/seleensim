Summary of Changes from Version 2.7 (June 6, 2017) to Version 3.3 (August 4, 2017) 
 
Major changes described in the following table have been made in this document to 
addre
ss the following issues: 
• Change in age criteria for eligibility from “18 -65”  to “17 to 65” to conform to 
FDA classification of pediatric subjects (Section 9.2.1) 
• Addition of date/time of the subject’s last meal before DBSF dose to interview 
questions because of potential effect of food on PK (Section 11.1)  
• Addition of instructions to have subjects lie down on their side for 15 minutes 
after dosing for consistency of dosing conditions (Section 11.2.4) 
• Change in the time of post-dose oral mucosa inspections to omit inspection at dis
solution, use film placement instead of film disintegration as time zero , and 
change of inspection time at 0.167 hours (10 minutes) to 0.25 hours (15 minutes) 
(Section 11.9) 
• Revision of process for assessing usability to avoid disturbing subjects during the 
15 mi
nutes when they are lying down after dosing (Section 11.10) 
• Clari fication of Investigator’s responsibility for ensuring that a study subject is 
s
ufficiently medically stable to be safely discharged from the clinical unit (EMU 
or GCRC) regardless of whether the subject has received study drug (Section 
12.1.4). 
• Revision of adverse event recording (Section 12.1) and analysis of safety 
endpoi
nts (Section 14.2.2) to clarify that seizures that occur during treatment 
periods are to be handled as adverse events unrelated to study drug for the purposes of analysis

6 3. SYNOPSIS  
Title:  A Multicenter, Open Label, Cross over Study to Assess the 
Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Diazepam Buccal Soluble Film (DBSF) 
in Adult Subjects with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_283169] s: The primary objective is to assess the comparative pharmacokinetics of 
DBSF in subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ( A) in the interictal state, and (B ) in the 
ictal/ peri-ictal state . 
 
(A) Subjects are considered to be in an interictal state if an i nterval of at 
least 3  hours has elapsed since any clinical observable postictal signs 
or symptoms (from the last observed seizure) and the subject has 
been seizure free over this period. Subjects on EEG monitoring can 
be considered to be in an interictal state if an interval of at least 3  
hours has elapsed since any postictal electrical findings on EEG.  
(B) For the purposes of this study, the ictal state is defined as an ongoing 
clinically observable seizure or seizure activity as verified via EEG. 
The peri -ictal state is defined clinically as the subject’s immediate 
postictal state following a generalized to nic-clonic (GTC) seizure or 
focal seizure with impaired awareness, and within [ADDRESS_345359] clonic jerk . For subjects on EEG monitoring, the peri- ictal state 
may be defined as less than 5 minutes after cessation of seizure 
activity 
(GTC or focal  seizure with impaired awareness) as 
verified via EEG.   
 
Secondary objectives include:  
• Evaluate the safety /to lerability  of DBSF following single-dose 
administration in subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  
• Evaluate the usability of DBSF in Period A and Period B  
Experiment al 
Design and Study 
Population: Multicenter, open-label  cross -over study in adult epi[INVESTIGATOR_283170]  
(DBSF) during the interictal state (Treatment Period A) and during the 
ictal/peri-ictal states (Treatment Period B) . 
 Male or female adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_283171] (EMU)  setting , General Clinical 
Research Center (GCRC) , or similar facility  for evaluation of seizures

7 will be eligible for t his study . Subjects will be 17 to 65 years of age, 
inclusive , with a body weight of ≥40 kg and ≤111 kg .  
Number of 
Subjects:  Approximately  [ADDRESS_345360] Drug:  Diazepam Buccal Soluble  Film  12.5  mg (Mono Sol Rx, LLC ) 
Treatments:  All subjects will receive one dose of 12.5 mg  DBSF in Period A and one 
dose of 12.5 mg DBSF in Period B.  
Study Duration:  • Screening Period: A minimum of 7 and a maximum of 28 days 
prior to admission 
• *Treatment P eriod A (interictal):  Approximately 8 hours in the 
GCRC or EMU facility + 6 additional visits for vital signs, 
adverse events ( AEs), and blood samples  (either at EMU, GCRC , 
or similar facility,  or home visits) . 
• Washout Period: Minimum of 14 days bet ween treatment periods 
• *Treatment Period B: D uration of Treatment Period B will vary , 
depending on seizure occurrence, but the period will last until  
approximately 4 hours after DBSF administration .  
• Follow-up Visit : A  follow -up visit will be scheduled to obtain 
safety data 14 ± [ADDRESS_345361] treatment period.  
*Period A and Period B may occur in either order as determined by [CONTACT_283201]; i.e., if a subject experiences a seizure before dosing during the first 
visit to the EMU or GCRC and if it has been determined that the subject meets 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, the Investigator  may regard that visit as Treatment 
Period B.   
Dosing Time:  The treatment periods will begin at a time of day consistent with usual 
EMU/GCRC protocol. In Treatment Period A, DBSF will be administered 
as soon as check -in procedures have been completed. In Treatment Period 
B, the subject will be monitored for seizure activity, and DBSF will be admin istered as soon as possible after detection of seizure activity, within 
[ADDRESS_345362] clonic jerk or within 5 minutes of cessation of the 
seizure as verified via EEG.  
Safety Monitoring 
and Endpoints:  Clinical seizure monitoring will start prior to DBSF treatment and will 
continue for 8 hours after dosing  in Treatment Period A  and 4 hours after

• Type, incidence, and severity of AEs at all visits . 
The Investigator  or des ignee will be present from approximately 
[ADDRESS_345363] 2  hours (120 minutes) post dose 
for each subject for each Treatment Period . The Investigator  or designee  
will remain on  call throughout the duration of the subject’s visit. The 
investigator will be  responsible for ensuring that a study subject is 
sufficiently medically stable to be safely discharged from the clinical unit 
(EMU or GCRC)  regardless of whether the subj ect has received study 
drug. 
Usability 
Endpoints: The following usability assessment s will be performed during the study:  
• Oral cavity placement assessment  
• Oral cavity insertion and retention assessment  
Pharmacokinetic 
Endpoints: The following pharmacokinetic parameters for diazepam will be  
determined: 
• Observed peak drug concentration (C max)   
• Observed time to reach maximum drug concentration (T max) 
• (Period A only) Area under the plasma concentration- ti me curve 
from time zero until the last measured time (AUC 0-t),  
• Comparison of C max after single-dose administration of DBSF in 
subjects du ring Period A and Period B, and to that of healthy 
normal subjects from pharmacokinetic data obtained in previous 
studies.  
• Comparison of T max after single-dose administration of DBSF in 
subjects during Period A and Period B, and to that of healthy 
normal s ubjects from pharmacokinetic data obtained in previous 
studies.

10 0.25 hours (15 minutes), 0.5 hours (30 minutes), 1 hour (60 minutes), 1.5 
hours (90 minutes), 2 hours (120 minutes), and 4 hours (240 minutes). In 
Treatment Period A, a plasma sample will also be taken at 8 hours (480 
minutes) in the EMU, GCRC or similar f acility , and a dditional plasma 
samples will be collected at 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, and [ADDRESS_345364] 
DBSF administration in an outpatient setting (either at EMU, GCRC or 
similar facility, or via home visits) .  
Collection of plasma samples will continue even if the administration of 
another anti-eptileptic drug (AED) is needed for rescue. 
Total Blood 
Volume: A total of a pproximately 151 mL of blood will be taken throughout the 
course of the study for clinical chemistry, hemat ology, and 
pharmacokinetics : Screening , 12.5 mL; Period A, 84 mL ; Period B, 42 
mL; and Follow -up, 12.5 mL.  
Analyte(s) To Be 
Measured:  Plasma  samples will be assayed for diazepam  and desmethyldiazepam 
using a validated analytical method according to the principles of Good 
Laboratory Practice.  
Statistical Analysis:  
  
 Summary statistics will be reported for pharmacokinetic, safety, and  
usability endpoints. No formal statistical tests will be performed to 
compare Period A vs. Period B on pharmacokinetic, safety, or usability endpoints. All analyses will be descriptive and exploratory.  
For Period A only, summary statistics will be reported for mean and 
geometric mean values of AUC 0-t, AUC inf, C max, Cl, Cl/kg, V d, and V d/kg, 
as well as mean and median T max for diazepam. For Period B, summary 
statistics will be reported for mean and geometric mean C max and 
AUC (0-4h) and for mean and median T max for diazepam. The 90% 
confidence intervals (CI) for the ratios (period A compared with period B) 
of geometric means for C max and AUC (0-4h) will be reported . Tmax will be 
compared (period A and B) with an appropriate non- parametric test.  
A descriptive comparison will also be performed to assess plasma 
concen
tration data for diazepam and desmethyldiazepam reported in 
subjects having true epi[INVESTIGATOR_283173] (Period B) compared to 
the data from the non- seizure period (Period A) and to data reported in the 
Phase 1 healthy volunteer studies who are in the DBSF clinical 
development program. 
Summary  statistics will also include an evaluation of subjects’ age, 
concomitant medications, and treatment with DBSF for epi[INVESTIGATOR_283174]. non -

 6. BACKGROUND AND PHARM ACOKINETICS  
Diazepam Buccal Soluble Film (DBSF) is being developed as an alternative dosage form 
to Diastat® AcuDial ™ rectal gel, a gel formulation of diazepam . The proposed indication 
is identical to that of Diastat® AcuDial ™ rectal gel: the treatment and management of 
selected, refractory patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_80295] (AEDs) and who require intermittent use of diazepam to control bouts of increased 
seizure activity  (Diastat
® AcuDial™ rectal gel Prescribing Information) . Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel has been marketed in the [LOCATION_002] since [ADDRESS_345373] from minut
es to hours (C ereghino 2007). When these seizures occur outside a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the 
patient is often transported to an acute care facility for treatment to prevent prolonged seizures  (Lowenstein 1998) . If treatment is not prompt and effective there is a risk that 
seizure activity will continue, and may become life threatening, including the risk of status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (Bergen 2006; Matheson 2000; Sankar 2007).  
In these cases, the primary goals of the treatment are seizure cessation and prevention of seiz
ure recurrence (Cereg hino 2007) . Usually, acute benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80299]. Nevertheless, many treatment options rely on appropriate intervention by [CONTACT_80348], and treatment may be delayed while the patient is transported to a medical facility  (Glauser 
2007).  
Outpatient treatment for these types of seizures may reduce emergency medical 
inte
rvention, decrease seizure duration, prevent general deterioration due to the repeated 
seizures and impr ove the quality of life of these patients. While rectal diazepam gel is 
currently available in the [LOCATION_002], a portion of the population does not benefit from this treatment, partly because the rectal route of administration is inappropriate or unacceptable (Fisgin 2002) . Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for an effective 
treatment with a rapid onset of action that is easily administered in the outpatient setting.

 6.2. Diazepam  
Diazepam is a long -acting “classical ” benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_283177]-A receptor and demonstrates anticonvulsant properties. It is commonly used 
to treat a range of conditions including seizures, anxiety, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80301], muscle spasms, trouble sleepi [INVESTIGATOR_007], and restless legs 
syndrome (Calcaterra 2014) . It can be taken by [CONTACT_1966], inserted into the rectum, injected 
into muscle, or injected intravenously. When given intravenously, effects begin in 1 to 5 minutes. When diazepam is taken orally, effects may be del ayed as long as 40 minutes 
(Riss 2008). 
Intravenous diazepam is a first- line 
 treatment for status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]  (Riss 2008). 
Diazepam rectal gel has been demonstrated superior to placebo gel in reducing the risk of 
continuing seizures. Diazepam is rarely used for the long- term treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_80302]  (Riss 2008). However, diazepam is effective when used intermittently for the 
prevention of repeated seizures. Like other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], diazepam administration may cause sedation, anxiolysis, and amnesia (Riss 2008). 
6.2.1. Mechan
 ism of Action  
Although the precise mechanism by [CONTACT_80349]- seiz ure effects is 
unknown, animal and in vitro studies suggest that diazepam acts to suppress seizures 
through an interaction with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors of the A- type 
(GABAA). GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, 
acts at this receptor to open the membrane channel allowin g chloride ions to flow into 
neurons (Tan 2011). Entry of chloride ions causes an inhibitory potential that reduces the ability of neurons to depolarize to the threshold potential necessary to produce action potentials. Excessive depolarization of neurons is implicated in the generation and spread of seizures. It is believed that diazepam enhances the actions of GABA by [CONTACT_283204]. 
6.2.2. Met
 abolism and Elimination  
Diazepam is extensively metabolized to one major active metabolite 
(d
esmethyldiazepam) and two minor active metabolites, 3 -hydroxydiazepam 
(temazepam) and 3 -hydroxy-N- diazepam (oxazepam)  (Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 
prescribing information December 2016) . With steady state dosing, desmethyldiazepam 
is found in plasma at concentrations equivalent to those of diazepam while oxazepam and 
temazepam are not usually detectable. The metabolism of diazepam is primarily hepatic 
and involves demethylation (involving primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) and 3-

Page 21 
 hydroxylatio n (involving primarily CYP3A4), followed by [CONTACT_12075]. The marked 
inter- individual variability in the clearance of diazepam reported in the literature is 
probably attributable to variability of CYP2C19 (which is known to exhibit genetic 
polymorphism; about 3-5% of Caucasians have little or no CYP2C19 activity and are “poor metabolizers”) and CYP3A4. No inhibition was demonstrated in the presence of inhibitors selective for CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2, indicating that these enzymes are n ot significantly involved in metabolism of diazepam (Dean 
2016).  
6.2.3. Pha
 rmacokinetics   
Per the prescribing information, rectal administration of a 15 mg dose of Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel produces peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours, with absolute 
bioavailability of 90% relative to Valium® injectable. The volume of distribution of 
diazepam rectal gel is calculated to be approximately 1 L/kg. The mean elimination half -
life of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam following administration of a 15 mg dose of diazepam rectal gel was found to be about 46 hours (
coefficient of variation  [CV] = 43%) 
and 71 hours (CV = 37%), respectively. Both diazepam and its major active metabolite desmethyldiazepam bind extensively to plasma proteins (95- 98%).  
6.3. Diastat® AcuDial™ Rectal Gel in the Treatment of Seizures  
Although the Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel formulation is considered generally safe and 
effective, the route of administration is less than ideal. The mechanics of administering a rectal gel can be a difficult, time -consuming, and embarrassing experience for both 
patient and care-givers alike. For example, the patient or care- giver must first remove 
articles of clothing and then place the patient in an appropriate position. The Diastat
® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel syringe tip is inserted into the rectum to a specific depth and the gel expressed into the rectal vault. However, improper technique can lead to patient injury and leakage of gel from the rectum can result in incomplete dosing and the need for an additional dose to compensate for any loss. Additionally, the at titude of some patients 
toward  a rectal route of drug administration is unfavorable which may negatively impact 
compliance to treatment (Tatum 2002) . Each of these factors has a po tential influence on 
patient morbidity. Persistent seizure activity is associated with worse outcomes across a spectrum of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_283178] (Haut 2006; Waterhouse 1999). Further, it has been 
demonstrated that if seizures are not terminated quickly,  escalating doses of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_283179] (Kapur 1997).

 6.4. Diazepam Buccal Soluble Film 
The new route of diazepam administration is via buccal soluble film. MonoSol Rx 
initiated development of DBSF, specifically intended for buccal delivery for patients who require control of intermittent bouts of seizure activity. DBSF contains the FDA approved active ingredient diazepam, a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], as a treatment for the management of selected, refractory patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], on stable regimens of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_283180]. The DBSF products, with a planned dose range of 5 mg to 15 mg, are  
expected to achieve peak plasma concentrations of diazepam equivalent to the reference therapy, Diastat
® AcuDial™ rectal gel. The DBSF product is intended for submission as 
a 505(b)(2) NDA using Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel as the reference therapy.  
Bucc al soluble diazepam may be particularly well -su ited for administration in outpatient 
settings. The DBSF is administered by [CONTACT_80351], where it adheres, dissolves, and releases the drug onto the buccal mucosa. 
Although buccal absorption is expected to be the primary route of absorption of the drug, 
some absorption through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may be possible due to 
swallowing of the saliva. It is expected that use of the buccal film will be similar to the 
use of Diastat
® AcuDial™ rectal gel, i.e., the film would be administered during or 
immediately after a seizure with characteristics for which the Diastat rectal gel would be indicated, and the goal of treatment would be the same as that of the rectal gel —to reduce 
the overall frequency of acute repetitive seizures.  
There is no need to position or disrobe the patient dur
 ing administration . Additionally, 
ther
e is less potential for delay in treatment, and greater patient and caregiver acceptance 
with imp roved compliance may be expected. For patients with bouts of increased seizure 
activity, the development of a DBSF will meet the treatment need for a form of diazepam that is effective, safe, allows reliable dose administration, and is easier to administer  than 
the rectal gel. Patients, caregivers, and physicians have indicated that this type of product would be desirable for acute, intermittent treatment of breakthrough, repetitive or cluster seizures.  
The clinical studies of DBSF have focused on assessin g its
  bioavailability relative to the 
reference therapy, Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel. Overall safety and tolerability are also 
being assessed in all clinical trials conducted with DBSF.  
To date, two human pi[INVESTIGATOR_283181]
 (Studies 1899 and 1900). A dose-proportionality study (Study 162013) and a 
food effect study (Study 162022) have been completed, and formal data analysis is

 ongoing at the time of this writing . A pi[INVESTIGATOR_283182] (Study 162021) to 
establish bioavailability  compared with Diastat® rectal gel  is underway. 
6.4.1. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_283183] 1899 and 1900 
The two pi[INVESTIGATOR_80306], open label, single-dose, fasting condition, 
cross
over studies in healthy male and female voluntee rs to assess the bioavailability of 
DBSF in comparison to the same nominal dose of Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel. Study 
1899 compared DBSF 5 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 5 mg , with 11  subjects 
completing both treatments.  Study 1900 compared DBSF 20 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ 
rectal gel 20 mg , with  10 subjects completing both treatments .  
Study 1899 compared DBSF 5 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 5 mg. Among the 11 
subjects who completed both treatments, DBSF 5 mg was bioequivalent to Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel [ADDRESS_345374] to area under the curve (AUC t and AUC inf), i.e., 
the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geometric means was within the 
acceptable range of 80 -125%. For C max, the ratio of geometric means was 1.07 with the 
90% CI 87.1-131.5%. The median T max was 0.67 hours for the DBSF (range 0.33-1.50 
hours) and 0.25 hours for the Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel (range 0.15 -1.00 hours). The 
difference in Tmax values was not statistically significant. 
Study 1900 compared DBSF 20 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 20 mg. Evaluable 
data from 10 subjects who completed both treatments showed that the extent of the absorption of DBSF 20 mg was comparable to Diastat
® 20 mg rectal gel, with the ratio of 
geometric means for AUC t and AUC inf within the acceptable range of 80 -125%. For C max, 
the ratio of geometric means was 158.72% with 90% CI 122.81-205.14. The median T max 
was 1.25 hours for the DBSF (range 0.36-2.05 hours) and 1.00 hours for the Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel (range 0.25 -2.00 hour s). The difference in Tmax values was not 
statistically significant. Examination of the mean plasma curves for DSBF and Diastat® 
showed that although the C max was higher for the DSBF relative to Diastat®, the 
pharmacokinetics were comparable in terms of ra pid rate of absorption, duration of 
plateau, and the rate of elimination. 
Figure 1  shows the C max values for DBSF vs. Diastat® at nominal doses of [ADDRESS_345375] that DBSF 5 mg is bioequivalent to 
Diastat® [ADDRESS_345376], because the C max after administration of Diastat® 20 mg is 
lower than the C max after DBSF 20 mg, DBSF 20 mg is not bioequivalent to Diastat® [ADDRESS_345377] that for DBSF, both C
max and AUC 
are dose -proportional over the 5 mg to 20 mg dose range, whereas, for Diastat®, although

 AUC is dose proportional (data not shown), C max is less than dose-proportional. In light 
of this observation, at doses above 5 mg, the nominal dose of diazepam administered as 
DBSF is expected to be lower th an the therapeutically equivalent nominal dose of 
Diastat®. 
 
Figure 1. C max Values by [CONTACT_283203]. Diastat® 
 
 Data are C max values (geometric means) from Studies 1899 (N=11) and Study 1900 (N=10). As shown in 
the figu re, Cmax values for DBSF were approximately dose -proportional while C max values for Diastat® 
were less than dose- proportional . (AUC (0-t) and AUC (0-inf) were approximately dose- proportional for both 
DBSF and Diastat® – data not shown.) Analysis of the individual data by [CONTACT_283205] C max values for DBSF were consistent with a direct linear relationship between C max and 
nominal dose, while the observed C max values for Diastat® appeared to be linearly related to dose to the 
2/3 power.

cons

These Diastat® doses bracket the full dose range for Diastat®. The objective of this study 
is to gain a thorough and precise understanding of the comparative exposure to diazepam 
and nordiazepam (both AUC and C max) after administration of DBSF or Di astat®.

 DBSF that will match the C max, AUC (0-inf), or AUC (0-t) at any selected time interval for 
any marketed dose of Diastat®.  
6.4.4. Study 162022 – Food Effect Study  
Study 162022 (formal analysis ongoing) was designed as a standard open -label,  
randomized, two -period, two-sequence crossover study with DBSF 15 mg administered 
under fasted conditions and following a high- fat meal.   The study was conducted with 16 
healthy male and female subjects  aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive.   
6.5. Rationale for Dose Levels of Diazepam Buccal Soluble Film  
As described above, t he available data indicate that DBSF is dose proportional over the 
studied dose- range, while Diastat® is less than dose  proportional with respect to C max. 
The data suggest that DBSF and Diastat® are approximately bioequivalent at the 5 mg 
dose, but are not bioequivalent at doses above 5 mg. It is clear from  Figure 1  that C max 
values for DBSF exceed C max from Diastat® as the dose increases beyond [ADDRESS_345379] a table 
identifying the dose of DBSF expected to produce C max values equivalent to the C max 
values expected after a given dose of Diastat® (Table 2 ).

 Table gives the nominal dose of DBSF expected to provide C max equivalent to given dose of Diastat®. 
These values are based on linear regression models using the data from Studies 1899 and 1900. C max 
following DBSF was linearly related to dose. C max following Diastat® was linearly related to Dose to the 
2/3 power.

In the current adult study, all subjects will receive a single dose of 12.5 mg of DBSF in 
each treatment period. Based on the projections in Table 2 , this dose is expected to match 
the C max expected from a 20 mg dose of Diastat®, or to exceed that Cmax by [CONTACT_23818] 
20%. 
6.6. Safety  
It is anticipated that the adverse event (AE) profile from systemic exposure observed with 
DBSF will resemble the already well -known profile for diazepam in general and the 
reference therapy, Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel, in particular.  
6.6.1. Diastat® AcuDial™ Rectal Gel  
Diazepam rectal gel was administered to 573 patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_283185] g Diastat® 
clinical trials, only some of which were placebo-controlled (Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal 
gel prescribing information December 2016). The controlled trials of Diastat® AcuDial™ 
rectal gel included children two years of age and older. Clinical studies have not been 
conducted to establish the efficacy and safety of Diazepam rectal gel in children under 
two years of age.  
Most AEs were mild -to-moderat e in severity and transient  in nature. The most frequent 
AE reported with diazepam rectal gel in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
was som
nolence (23%). Less frequent AE  were headache (≤5%), diarrhea (≤4%), ataxia 
(≤3%), di
zziness (≤3%), euphoria (≤3%), incoordination (≤3%), rash (≤3%), 
vasodilatatio n (≤2%), and asthma (≤2%).

the pi[INVESTIGATOR_283187] (Study 162021) . A healthy 28-year-old male s ubject 
with no significant medical history  experienced decreased heart rate (37 bpm) , decreased 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], and drowsiness after administration of 15 mg of DBSF . Telemetry 
showed sinus bradycardia. The investigator administered multiple doses of flumazenil as well as a single dose of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_283188]. The patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283189]: [ZIP_CODE] 6

 overnight for observation and bradycardia resolved with no further treatment. The onset 
of symptoms occurred near the expected time of peak concentration of the study drug, 
and symptoms were consistent with known effects of diazepam. Plasma concentrations of 
diazepam were available until 2 hours after dosing and again at 48 hours. The maximum 
concentration  (Cmax) for diazepam in this subj ect (Tmax 1.5 h) was 482.37 ng/mL. This 
value is in line  with  the mean C max observed following 15 mg DBSF in the dose-
proportionality study (Study162013) : mean C max 492.21, median Tmax 1.268 h (N = 30). 
Similarly, the diazepam plasma  concentration  at 48 hours (112.68 ng/mL) was also in the 
expected range. Based on this information, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_283190]. The reason for this subject’s unusual sensitivity to diazepam is unknown.  
6.6.3. Over
 dosage 
According to the prescribing information for Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel (December 
2016), pre
vious reports of diazepam overdosage have shown that manifestations of 
diazepam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma, and diminished reflexes. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pulse, and blood pressure should be monitored, as in all cases of drug overdosage, although, in general, these effects have been minimal. General supportive measures should be employed, along with intravenous fluids, and an adequate airway maintained. Hypotension may be combated by [CONTACT_283206]. Dialysis is of limited value.  
Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- recept
 or antagonist, is indicated for the complete 
or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_283191] a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_283192]. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80311]. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_283193]. The prescriber should be 
aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-
term benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80313]. Caution should be observed in us e of flumazenil in epi[INVESTIGATOR_80314]. The 
complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior to use.

 7. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetics of DBSF in adult subjects with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_58824] (A) the interictal  state  and (B) the  ictal/peri- ictal state .  
(A) Subjects are considered to be in an interictal state if an interval of at least 3 hours 
has elapsed since any clinical observable postictal signs or symptoms (from the last observed seizure) and the subject  has been seizure free over this period. 
Subjects on EEG monitoring can be considered to be in an interictal state if an 
interval of at least 3  hours has elapsed since any postictal electrical findings on 
EEG.  
(B) For the purposes of this study, the ictal state is defined as an ongoing clinically 
observable seizure or seizure activity as verified via EEG. The peri -ictal state is 
defined clinically as t he subject’s immediate postictal state following a 
generalized tonic- clonic (GTC) seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness , 
and within [ADDRESS_345381] clonic jerk. For subjects on EEG 
monitoring, the peri- ictal state may be defined as less than 5 minutes after 
cessation of seizure activity as verified via EEG.  
Secondary objectives include: 
• Evaluate the safety /toler ability  of DBSF following single-dose administration in 
subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  
• Evaluate the usability of DBSF in Period A and Period B 
Data
 from this study are int ended to support a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for the 
test product. 
8. STUDY DESIGN 
8.1. Discussion of Study Design  
8.1.1. Study Design  
This study uses a m ulticenter, open- label,  crossover design  with the following periods: 
Screening, Treatment Period A ( interictal DBSF dos ing and pharmacokinetic evaluation), 
minimum washout period of 14 days, Treatment Period B (ictal/peri -ictal DBSF dos ing 
and pharmacokinetic evaluation), and Follow-up 14 (± 2) days after treatment . Definitions

 remain in the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_80315] (EMU) or General Clinical Research Center 
(GCRC) for medical reasons after the end of Treatment Period  A or B, this time will be 
designated as Post -treatment . The treatment periods may occur in either order depending 
on occurrence of seizures.  
8.1.2. Screening P eriod  (Section  9.1)  
The Screening Period will occur [ADDRESS_345382]’s legally authorized representative must provide written informed 
consent prior to the initiation of any screening procedures. Subjects under the age of [ADDRESS_345383]  
will be evaluated for study participation  as described in Section  9.1 and Section  9.2.  
8.1.3. Treatment Periods  (Section  11.2)   
The treatment periods will begin at a time of day consistent with usual EMU/GCRC 
protocol.
 Subjects will arrive at the EMU, GCRC or similar facility on their scheduled 
day and time. Subjects are to continue taking their regular AEDs prior to and throughout each treatment period.  
Check -in Procedures:  Subject
 s will undergo standard admission procedures, including 
the placement of an indwelling cannula for intravenous access, assessment of medical history, medications, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating scale (C SSRS). Urine drug tests and a breath alcohol test will be performed on all 
subjects . Urine pregnancy tests will also be performed for women of child bearing 
potential.  
The Investigator or medical staff will review results from the Screening Period and, if 
applicabl
e, results from the previous treatment period, including vital signs ( respi[INVESTIGATOR_862] [RR], heart rate [HR], blood pressure [ BP], temperature), 12- lead ECG , clinical 
laboratory tests , and AEs. The subject’s informed consent, medical history, medications, 
use of restricted substances, and results from the current visit assessments will be 
reviewed for eligibility and safety. If this is a first treatment visit, subjects who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be enrolled. Subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled . If enrolled subjects who have completed 
a previous treatment visit no longer meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be discontinued from the study.

 A study drug kit will be assig ned by [CONTACT_80356] (IWRS). All 
subjects will receive one dose of 12.[ADDRESS_345384] 3  hours has elapsed since any clinical postictal signs or symptoms (from the 
last o bserved seizure) have been observed and the subject has been seizure free over this 
period. If clinical assessment (and EEG monitoring, if applicable) show no seizure 
activity, the subject will receive a single dose of 12.5 mg DBSF (see placement diagram in Appendix A ). Safety and PK assessments will be performed as described below. 
Clinica 
l monitoring will continue until the end of the treatment period (8 hours), and 
video EEG monitoring will continue as specified by [CONTACT_80374].  
If the subject experiences a seizure before dosing during Treatment Period A, and if it has 
been det
ermined that the subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the 
Investigator may regard this visit as Treatment Period B, and Treatment Period A will be 
rescheduled.  If no seizure occurs and Treatment Period A is completed, the subject will 
be scheduled for Treatment Period B. 
Treatment Period B:  Monitor ing for the occurre nce of seizures as per EMU or GCRC 
protocol will continue until the subject experiences a qualifying ( GTC seizure or focal 
seizure with impaired awareness ). If the subject’s AEDs are to be tapered  (e.g., if per 
EMU or GCRC protocol), t he Investigator will determine and record the time to begin 
tapering the AEDs, including the doses administered or prescribed, percent dose 
reduction, and tapering rate.  
Seizure management and the required intervention will be determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
Sub
jects with a GTC seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness  who are 
determined to be medically appropriate to receive study drug ( DBSF ) will receive a 
single -dose of 12.5 mg DBSF  
• during the seizure, OR  
• with
in [ADDRESS_345385] clonic jerk , AND/ OR  
• within 5 minutes after cessation of the seizure as verified via EEG .

Adult EMU Protocol Version Number: 3.3, August 4, [ADDRESS_345386]’s seizure persist s after the single  dose of DBSF, an alternative AED 
medication (rescue medication) may be administered as medically required according to 
the standard -of-care EMU or GCRC  treatment protocol. Any alternative AED 
medication s will be recorded in the study CRF. The physician in charge will be 
encouraged but not required to use intravenous lorazepam for rescue in preference to 
intravenous diazepam. The Investigator will be permitted  to discontinue the subject from 
the study protocol at any time throughout the study protocol. At the end of the t reatment 
period, c linical seizure assessment , AEDs and concomitant medication, and AE s will be 
reviewed . If AEDs were tapered previously, the Investigator  will determine  and record 
the time to restart the subject’s AED medications, including the doses administered or 
prescribed  and the schedule for percent dose increase.   
8.1.4. Post-trea tment  
If the subject remain s in the EMU , GCRC, or similar facility  following the end of the 
treatment period , that time will be regarded as a post-treatment  period. While the subject 
remains in the EMU , GCRC , or similar facility, general seizure activity, administration of 
additiona l AEDs, surgical treatment of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and AEs will be recorded. The 
subject will be discharged when medically stable .  
8.1.5. Follow- u p Visit   
Safety data ( includi ng concomitant medication, vital signs, clinical lab oratory test s, AE s, 
comprehensive physical and neurological examinations, C-SSRS, and inspection of oral mucosa) will be obtained at a follow-up visit in an outpatient setting (to be determined by 
[CONTACT_80375]) at 14 ± [ADDRESS_345387] treatment period (A or B). 
8.1.6. PK and Sa
 fety Assessments 
The following assessments will be performed  (see Sect ion 11.4 for details) :  
Diazep
am PK  (Sectio n 11.4.1). In both treatment periods, plasma samples for diazepam 
and th
e active metabolite desmethyldiazepam PK will be obtained before DBSF 
administration and post dose at the following time points (±5 minutes): 0.25 hours (15 
minutes), 0.5 hours (30 minutes), 1 hour (60 minutes), 1.5 hours (90 minutes), 2 hours (120 minutes), and 4 hours (240 minutes) . In Treatment Period A, a plasma sample will 
also be taken at 8 hours (480 minutes) in the EMU, GCRC or similar facility, and 
additional plasma samples will be collected at 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240 hours after DBSF administration in an outpatient setting (either at the EMU, GCRC or similar

whether another AED is administered for rescue.  
Vital Signs . The subject ’s BP, HR, RR, and temperature will be recorded at Screening , 
during the t reatment visits predose and post dose, and at  Follow-up as described in 
Section  11.6. 
Oral Mucosal Inspection . As descri bed in Section  11.9, to c heck for any mucosal 
irritation , an
 illumination -assisted  visual inspection of the DBSF application site will be 
performed at Screening; at each treatment visit prior to study drug administration and 
approximately  0.25 hours (15 minutes), 0.5 hours (30 minutes), and 1 hour (60 minutes) 
after application of the film (±5 minutes for all time points ); and at Follow-up.  
Usability .  The usabi lity of DBSF will be evaluated by [CONTACT_80360] , 
retention , and placement after each administration  during the treatment periods as 
described in Section  11.10.  
Laboratory Safe ty. Blood sample s will be collected for laboratory safety  at Screening  
and at Follow-up or upon early termination (Section  11.4.2). 
ECG . A 12 -lead EC G will be obtained at Screening , and at each treatment period both 
predose and 4 hours after dosing ( Section  11.7).  
8.2. Study Duration and Washout  
The study includes the Screening Period 7 to 28 days before Day 1 ; Treatment Period A 
(interictal)  1 day; a minimum washout period of 14 days; Treatment Period B (ictal/peri-
ictal)  1 day; and Follow-up 14 days (±2 days) after the second treatment period. Thus, t he 
minimum study duration will be approximately 35 days , and the maximum will be 
approximately 58 days.

This determination will be made by [CONTACT_283212]. Removal of a subject from the study will only be permitted prior to commencement of bioanalysis.  
If an enrolled  su
 bject’s participation is terminated prematurely  or the subject withdraws 
from the study , the cause , date, and time of the early termination or withdrawal will be 
documented on the source documents and in the final study report. Efforts will be made to obtain an e arly termination visit at which c linical seizure assessment  will be done , vital 
signs will be recorded, clinical laboratory tests will be performed, an oral mucosal 
inspection will be performed, and any concomitant medica tions, including AEDs , will be 
recorded .

11.2. Treatment Period s A and B  
11.2.1. Check -in Procedures   
For each treatment period, s ubjec ts will undergo standard admission procedures as 
described below , including the placement of an indwelling cannula for intravenous 
access, assessment of medical history, medications, date/time of the subject ’s last meal 
before the DBSF dose, vital signs, urine pregnancy and drug tests, breath tests, 12- lead 
ECG, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating scale (C SSRS), as age appropriate.  
Subjects or their legally authorized representatives will be questioned about whether they 
ha
ve complied with the study restrictions. If a restricted drug or non-drug therapy 
 Protocol Number: [ZIP_CODE] 6  
Adult EMU Protocol Version Number: 3.3, August 4, [ADDRESS_345414]’s 
participation will be made by [CONTACT_11219] /or by [CONTACT_1034]. 
If the subject reports having received any dosage form of diazepam within the pas t [ADDRESS_345415] is positive for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], then the 
Investigator will make a judgment as to whether to reschedule the visit.  
At each period check- in, the Investigator will review results from the Screening Period 
and, if applicable, results from the previous treatment period, including vital signs (BP, HR, RR, temperature), 12- lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests , informed consent, 
medical history, medications, seizure diaries, use of restricted substances , results of drug 
tests, breath alcohol test , and pregnancy test. R esults from the current visit assessments 
will also be reviewed for eligibility and safety. If this is a first treatment visit, subjects 
who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be enrolled. Subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. If enrolled subjects who ha ve 
completed a previous treatment visit no longer meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be discontinued from the study.  
A study drug kit will be assigned by [CONTACT_80356] (IWRS). All 
subjec
ts will receive one dose of 12.[ADDRESS_345416] a 3 -hour int erval has 
elapsed since any clinical postictal signs or sympt oms (from the last observed seizure) 
have been observed and the subject has been seizure free over this period. If clinical 
and/or EEG monitoring show no seizure activity, the subject will receive a single dose of 12.5 mg DBSF (see placement diagram in Appendix A ). Safety and PK assessments will 
be perf 
ormed as described below. Clinical monitoring will continue until the end of the 
treatment period (8 hours), and video EEG monitoring will continue as specified by [CONTACT_80344].  
If the subject experiences a seizure before dosing during Treatment Period A, and if it has 
been det
ermined that the subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the 
 Protocol Number: [ZIP_CODE] 6  
Adult EMU Protocol Version Number: 3.3, August 4, [ADDRESS_345417] will be scheduled for Treatment Period B. 
11.2.3. Treatm
 ent Period B:   
Monitoring for the occurrence of seizures will continue until the subject experiences a 
GTC 
seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness. If the subject’s AEDs are to be 
tapered as per EMU or GCRC protocol, and t he Investigator  will determine and record 
the time to begin tapering the AEDs, including the percent dose reduction and tapering 
rate.  
Seizure management and the required intervention will be determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
Sub
jects with a GTC seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness  who are 
determined to be medica lly appropriate to receive study drug ( DBSF ) will receive a 
single -dose of 12.[ADDRESS_345418]’s seizure pers ists af ter the single  dose of DBSF, an alternative AED 
medication (rescue medication) can be administered as medically required and according 
to the standard -of-care EMU or GCRC  treatment protocol. The physician in charge will 
be encouraged but not required to use intravenous lorazepam for rescue and to avoid using intravenous diazepam. The Investigator will be allowed to discontinue the subject 
from the study protocol at any time throughout the study.  
11.2.4. Dosin
 g 
Before administration of the DBSF, the Investigator will perform an oral safety 
inspec
tion as described in Section  11.9. The dosing process will cons ist of the following 
steps:  
• When opening the foil pouch containing the study drug, staff are to use scissors to 
car
efully cut along the wide edge of the pouch and use gloves when handling and 
administering the study drug to the subject.  
• Subjects will be instructed to swallow saliva  and the n open their mouth.  
• If the predose oral safety assessment reveals evi dence of mucosal injury or 
irritation (e.g., a cheek bite resulting from a seizure) , care should be taken to 
avoid placement of DBSF in that area.

 • Staff will place the film on the tip of a finger and then use the finger to insert the 
film into the subject’s mouth.  
• The film is to be center ed agains t the inner aspect of the right or left cheek , so that 
it adheres to the buccal mucosa (refer to  Appendix A  for a diagram of film 
placement)
. The f ilm may be placed without regard to the location of the parotid 
duct.  
• The subject will be instructed to close his/her mouth in a natural way, without 
swallo wi
ng, chewing, biting, or breaking the DBSF. 
• As soon as the film has been placed on the buccal mucosa, the subject should be 
instruc
ted to lie on his or her side. The subject should lie on the right side (right 
side down) if the DBSF has been placed on the right buccal surface, or on the left 
side (left side down) if the DBSF has been placed on the left buccal surface. It is recommended that the subject should remain in position (lying on the appropriate side) for 15 minutes. Subjects should be instructed t hat during this time they 
should not chew, bite, or manipulate the side of the oral cavity to which the DBSF 
was applied .  
• Staff will observe the patient during this [ADDRESS_345419] spi[INVESTIGATOR_80331], 
Staff should try to reinsert the film, if possible.  No second film should be applied. 
• Dosing time will be set to the time the film is placed on the buccal mucosa . At [ADDRESS_345420]’s hands will be inspected to check whether the subject had removed the film (or a part of the film) from the mouth.  
The study staff will evaluate the insertion process to determine usability of the film as 
describe
d in Section 11.10. As noted in Section  11.[ADDRESS_345421] will be discharged when medically stable.

To assess usability of DBSF, oral cavity insertion, retention, and placement will also be evaluated for each administration. The following usability endpoints will be reported: 
• Whe ther successful placement was achieved (Placement is judged to be successful 
when
 the film adheres to the center of the buccal mucosa of either the right or the 
left cheek, as shown in Appendix A ). 
• Location of film placement (right or left)  
• Time o
f successful film placement. 
• Numb
er of attempts needed to successfully insert the film (An attempt is defined 
as in
serting the finger with the film into the subject’s mouth.) 
• Whether any remnant of the film remained 15 minutes after placement .  
(If
 yes, the subject should be instructed to swallow the remaining film and 15 
minutes will be the time of complete film disintegration/dissolution that is reported in the CRF.) 
• Whether the subject spit or blew the film out of their mouth . If y
 es, whether an 
attempt was made to reinsert it.  
• Whether any saliva exited the subject’s mouth . If ye s, time of exit and estimated 
total amount (in mL) .  
• Whether a check of the subject’s hands at 15 minutes after film placement 
revea
led that the film (or a part of the film) was removed by [CONTACT_1130].  
Where applicable, categorical explanations of the circumstances will be given (e.g., 
uncooperat
ive or confused patient in a peri -ictal state).

 11.11.  Food and Fluid Intake  
The date/time of the patient’s last meal before DBSF dose (both treatment periods)  will 
be recorded. Food and water i ntake will be restricted for [ADDRESS_345432] operating procedures ( SOPs ) in 
conformity with regulatory requirements to ensure the timely, accurate, and complete reporting of safety information. 
12.1. Adverse Event Recording and Follow-up  
Subjects will be instructed to inform clinic personnel of any untoward medical symptoms and/or events that may arise during the course of the study. Seizures will be recorded as AEs. 
At the treatment periods and follow-up visit, subjects will be questioned concerning sym
ptoms that may have occurred after the previous administration of the study drug. 
The incidence, seriousness,  severity , duration, and relationship to study drug of all AEs 
will be recorded . 
12.1.1. Seriou s Adverse Events 
An SAE is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• I
s life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
i
t occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• R
esults in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
abi
lity to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect ( in the child of a subject who was exposed 
to the study drug)

Adult EMU Protocol Version Number: 3.3, August 4, [ADDRESS_345433] and may require medic al or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
12.1.2. Evalu
 ation of Severity of AEs 
Severity will be evaluated  according to the following scale:  
Mild  Adverse event resulting in discomfort, but not sufficient to cause 
interference in normal daily activities.  
Moderate  Adverse event resulting in discomfort that is sufficient to cause 
interference in dai ly activities.  
Severe  Adverse event resulting in discomfort causing an inability to carry out 
normal daily activities.  
 
Adverse Event monitoring and reporting will be followed-up until resolution or for up to 2 
weeks following completion of the study, after which the Investigator will decide the course of action. 
12.1.3. Ass
 essing Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of all AEs  to the drug, using the following 
scale:  
 Protocol Number: [ZIP_CODE] 6  
Adult EMU Protocol Version Number: 3.3, August 4, [ADDRESS_345434] abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide 
plausible explanation.  
Unrelated  This category is appli cable to AEs which are judged to be clearly and 
incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (diseases, environment, etc.) and do not meet the criteria for drug re lationship listed for the above-mentioned 
conditions.  
 
All AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_737], who must approve the subject for 
subsequent dosing. 
12.1.4. Investigator Presence  
The
 Investigator  or  designee will be present from approximately [ADDRESS_345435]’s treatment visit. The 
Investigator will be  responsible for ensuring that a study subject is sufficiently medically stable to 
be safely discharged from the clinical unit  (EMU or GCRC)  regardless of whether the subject has 
received study drug.   
12.1.5. Foll ow-up of AEs  
All AEs, whether serious or non-serious, will be monitored throughout the study and 
fol
lowed to resolution or for up to 2 weeks following completion of the study, after which 
the Investigator will decide the course of action.

 12.2. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events 
Subjects will be instructed to inform clinic personnel of any AEs that may arise during 
the course of the study. Treatment of AEs  will be administered under the direction of the 
Investigator. 
All symptoms will be recorded by [CONTACT_283219]. 
When appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document 
res
olution of the event(s). 
Adverse events will be coded into the Preferred Term (PT), classified according to the curr
ent version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) with System 
Organ Classification (SOC) and reported with severity, duration, onset time and 
relationsh ip to study drug and action taken. 
Female subjects of child -bea ring potential must have a negative pregnancy test before 
study drug administration at each Treatment Visit. Any cases of pregnancy in female subjects that become known after administration of study drug will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_80381]/emailing a completed Pregnancy Report to the 
Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not 
be processed as an SAE; however , the Investigator will follow the subject until 
completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_283220] a follow -up 
Pregnancy Report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed SAE form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
All SAEs, whether or not the event is deemed drug- relat
 ed, w ill be reported on the SAE 
Report Form by [CONTACT_283221], inVentiv Health within twenty -four hours (24 hours) of the Investigator or site staff becoming

 13.2. Samples to be Assayed  
Samples from all subjects dosed in this bioavailability /observational study will be 
analyzed.  
  
13.3. Analyte(s) in Biological Matrix  
Plasma  samples will be assayed for diazepam  and desmethyldiazepam  using a validated 
analytical method according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice.  
14. PHARMACOK INETIC AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
14.1. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Data Set  
The data from the following subjects will be included in the final PK and statistical 
analysis:  
• Subjects who complete at least one s tudy period. 
• Subjects who have missed samples but for whom it has been predicted prior to the 
st
art of bioanalytical analysis that reliable estimates of the PK parameters should 
be possible. 
Data from subjects who were dismissed/withdrawn (for any reason other than non-
com
pliance) or who withdrew will be evaluated by a Medical Monitor and/or the Sponsor 
for inclusion in the PK  and statistical analysis. If reliable estimation of PK parameters 
will be judged possible, the data will be included in the analysis. If removed from the 
analysis, the data will be presented separately.  
Any decision for excluding data from the final data set  wil l be provided with a detailed 
explanation and will be properly recorded and dated. 
The final  PK d ata set will be defined prior to sample analysis.  
14.2. Data Analyzed

 The PK and/or statistical analyses outlined in this protocol may be altered with appropriate 
justification.  A final Statistical Analysis Plan will be issued prior to database lock.  
14.2.1. Pha rmacokinetic Endpoints  
For Treatment Period A, the following PK  pa rameters will be estimated (where possible) 
for diazepam  and included in the PK  and statistical analysis for the subjects in the final 
data set:  
Cmax The maximal observed plasma concentration.  
Tmax Time when the maximal plasma concentration is observed.  
AUC t Area under the concentration -time curve from time zero until the last 
measurable concentration or last sampling time t, whichever occurs first. AUC t 
is estimated using the trapezoidal method.  
AUC inf Area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity, calculated 
as AUC t + C last/λ, where C last is the last measurable concentration.  
λ Terminal elimination rate constant, estimated by [CONTACT_148282] -concentration vs. time plot.  
T1/[ADDRESS_345436](2)/λ . 
Cl Clearance (L/hr) estimated from Dose/AUC inf 
Cl/kg  Clearance/kg (L/hr/kg) estimated from Dose/kg/AUC inf 
Vdβ Volume of distribution (L) estimated from  Cl/ λ(β) 
 
For PK and statistical analyses, drug concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation 
(
BLQ) of an assay will be considered as zero except when they occur between two non-
BLQ concentrations , where they will be considered as missing during PK  calculations 
and estimations.  
Missed samples and non-reportable concentrations (e.g., quantity not sufficient) from the 
ana
lytical laboratory will be treated as missing in the PK analysis.  
The λ, T 1/2, and AUC inf parameters will not be estimated for plasma concentration -time 
profiles where the terminal linear phase is not clearly defined.  
 Protocol Number: [ZIP_CODE] 6  
Adult EMU Protocol Version Number: 3.3, August 4, [ADDRESS_345437] samples, only the C max and T max will be presented and included in the statistical 
analysis.  Other PK parameters will not be reported.

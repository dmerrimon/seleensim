Methodology:  
 
This is a Phase  I/II study  of KW-0761  in patients  with advanced  and/or metastatic  solid 
organ  malignancies.  Phase  I of the study  will be an open  label, non -randomized,  dose  
escalation,  and safety study  in adults  with histologically  confirmed  advanced  and/or  
metastatic  solid tumor  malignancies.  Subjects  who sign an Informed  Consent form  and 
who meet the eligibility  criteria  will be enrolled  to receive  a weekly  intravenous  (IV) dose  of 
KW-0761  ranging  from 0.5 mg/kg  to 10.0 mg/kg  as feasible  starting  on Day 1 for 4 weeks  
(cycle  1) and a dose  every 2 weeks  for 4 weeks  starting  on day 29 (cycle 2).  The initial  
treatment  course  will include  Cycle  1 + Cycle  2. Subsequent treatment courses  are 
permissible  for subjects  demonstrating  a response  or maintaining  stable  disease  and will 
consist  of an infusion  of KW-[ADDRESS_308432]  
discontinues  from the study for reasons  other than  DLT prior to receiving  four complete  
infusions  (Week  4), the subject will be replaced.

additional tests  and/or  follow -up visits  in clinic  during  this period  as needed  to evaluate  
and/or treat any  adverse  event  (AEs).  
 
Part 2 of the study  (Phase  II) will enroll  a total of 48 subjects,  16 patients  in 3 tumor - 
specific  expansion  cohorts  each  treated  with the MTD  (or highest  dose  tested)  as 
determined  in the Phase  I part of the study. The [ADDRESS_308437]  
carcinoma  (negative for immunohistochemical expression  of the estrogen  receptor,  
progesterone  receptor,  and the Her2  protein).  
 
Number  of subjects:  
 
Enrollment  of up to 72  subjects  is planned. Of  the 72 subjects,  a maximum of 24 will be 
enrolled  in the dose  escalation  part of this study  and the remaining  48 will be enrolled  to 3 
tumor -specific  expansion  cohorts. Depending  on the dose  escalation  cohort, 2 to 5 
additional subjects  may be added  to a cohort in  whom  a dose limiting  toxicity  has been  
observed  to confirm results  (Toxicity  Definitions  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_14123]; Section  9.5). 
 
Cohort  dose  schedule:  
 
In the dose  escalation  portion, the starting  dose  will be 0.5  mg/kg  administered  i.v.once  
every  week  for four weeks  and then once  every 2 weeks  for 4 weeks. Succeeding  dose  
levels  will be 1,  3, and 10 mg/kg  as feasible.

course  (treatment  course  2, treatment course  3, etc.) will be defined as  completion  of two 
additional infusions  of KW-[ADDRESS_308441]  may continue  therapy  after consultation  between  the investigator  
and the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_253539] (refer to Section  4.8, Criteria for Study  Termination).  
 
Definition  of Maximum  Tolerated  Dose  (MTD)  
 
The MTD  is defined  as the dose  below  that dose  at which  at least [ADDRESS_308442] part of this trial. 
 
Definition  of Phase  II Dose  
 
The Phase  II dose  will be the  MTD  as determined  in the  Phase  I part of the trial. If three  
evaluable  subjects  do not experience  a DLT in the 10 mg/kg  dosing  cohort then  the Phase  
II dose  will be 10 mg/kg.  
Dose -Limiting  Toxicity  
 
A dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  is any toxicity  that does  not have  a clear -cut alternative  
explanation.  Any of the following,  specified  below,  will be considered  a DLT:  
 
A DLT will be defined  as any > Grade  3 non-hematologic or hematologic  toxicity  that is 
related  to treatment  . The following  are exceptions  to the definition  and will be considered  
a DLT if: 
 
• Grade  4 neutropenia  > 7 days  
 
• Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  
 
• Grade  [ADDRESS_308443] cohort  will be 0.5  mg/kg. In the absence  of a DLT, dose  will be 
escalated  in the following  increments,  1, 3, and 10 mg/kg  as feasible.  Dose  escalation will 
cease  when  at least one of the following  endpoints  is reached:

 • The MTD  is exceeded; OR  
 
• A cohort  of at least 3 subjects  has been  dosed  with 10 mg/kg  KW-[ADDRESS_308444]  carcinoma  will 
then be enrolled  and treated  at that dose.  A maximum of 48 subjects,  16 of each  
carcinoma  type are to be treated  with the dose  determined  from the initial  portion  of the 
study.  A total of 15 subjects, including  those  receiving  the dose  determined from Phase  1, 
will be treated  initially.  
 
Criteria  for Evaluation:  
 
• Safety:  The safety  of KW-0761  will be determined  by [CONTACT_253583], changes  in 
physical examinations,  vital sign  measurements,  ECGs  and laboratory  analyses.   
Safety  evaluations  will be performed  throughout the  study. All  AEs and serious  AEs  
will be graded  according  to the National Cancer Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  
for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Scale,  Version  4.03. A dose  limiting  toxicity  (DLT) is  
defined  as any Grade  3 or higher infusion  reaction  or any Grade  3 or 4 toxicity,  unless  
the AE is clearly  and incontrovertibly  due to extraneous  causes.  
• Pharmacodynamics:  A detailed  assessment of the biologic  activity of KW-0761  will 
be completed  on all subjects  enrolled  into this  study.  This will include  acquisition  of 
serial  serum, peripheral  blood  mononuclear cells, stool  samples,  and tumor  tissue  to 
evaluate  the immunoregulatory  activity  of this agent.  
 
• Efficacy:  Efficacy  evaluations  will be based  on response  to treatment (PR or better),  
time to PD  and duration  of overall  response.  Changes  in tumor measurements  and 
tumor responses  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_253584]  1.[ADDRESS_308445]  deviation,  minimum,  
maximum,  and number  of observations.  Any statistical testing  will be two tailed  at the 5% 
significance  level.  The frequency  of AEs will be tabulated.  Baseline, end -of-study,  and 
change  from baseline  for clinical l aboratories, vital signs, and ECG data  will be 
summarized.  Descriptive  statistics  will be computed  for safety parameters  as appropriate.

 2.1 OBJECTIVES AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary Objectives:  
• Phase  I: Determine  safety  and tolerability  profiles, maximum tolerated  dose  (MTD)  if 
achieved,  recommended  Phase  II dose  (RP2D), and  dose -limiting  toxicity  (DLT) of KW- 
0761.  
• Phase  II: Determine  the safety  and preliminary  efficacy  of KW-0761  as determined  by 
[CONTACT_44859] -related  response  criteria (irRC)  in subjects  with triple -negative  breast  cancer,  
non-small  cell lung cancer,  and gastric  adenocarcinoma.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
• Explore  the antitumor  activity of KW-0761  using  measures  of activity;  including  Best 
Overall  Response  Rate (BORR), Disease  Control Rate,  Duration  of Response, Time  to 
Response,  and Progression  Free Survival  (PFS) using  both RECIST  v1.1 and  immune - 
related  response  criteria  (irRC)  in cohorts  of three  specific  tumor types  treated  at the MTD.  
• Evaluate  the effect  of KW-0761  on peripheral  and intratumoral lymphocyte  subset  
composition  and function.  
• Evaluate  the long-term and/or post -treatment  safety  of KW-0761  
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
• Evaluate  the effect  of KW-0761  on the fecal  microbiota.  
• Evaluate  KW-[ADDRESS_308446] suppression  of effector  T cells5. Regulatory  T cells 
(Treg) are a subset of CD4+  T cells that are requisite  for control of autoimmunity,  
dampening  excessive  inflammation  caused  by [CONTACT_253585],  and 
maintaining maternal -fetal tolerance6-8. While  Treg cells are critical  for maintaining  
peripheral  tolerance, their  potent  immunoregulatory properties  can promote  the 
development  and progression  of numerous  types  
of malignancies by [CONTACT_253586]9,10. Treg cell recognition  of self- 
antigens is  in part responsible  for their ability  to Figure 1.  Ablation  of Treg cells affects  the growth  
of fully established  primary  tumors . 
maintain  immune  homeostasis. As  most tumor  associated  antigens  are modified  or 
aberrantly expressed  self antigens,  Treg are considered  to be active  participants  in tumor

 specific  immune  privilege11. This is particularly  exemplified  in the observed  regression  of 
established tumors  in experimental  models  of Treg cell  depletio n.12-14 
Treg cells exert  their suppressive  function  through  a number of different mechanisms10. 
CD25,  a subunit  of the IL-2 receptor  and the original  Treg cell surface  marker, is  
constitutively  and highly  expressed  on Treg cells but  also upregulated  on effector  T cells15. 
The high level of expression  on Treg cells could  deprive  effector  T cells of IL-2 and inhibit  
their proliferation16. CTLA -4 is well known  in limiting  responses  of activated  T cells and is 
also implicated  in Treg cell−mediated  suppression17. Treg cells can also inhibit  the function  
of dendritic  cells. LAG -3, a CD4 homologue  that exhibits  high binding  affinity  with MHC  
class II  is thought to be  required  for maximal suppressive action  of Treg cells18. Binding  of 
major  histocompatibility  complex  (MHC)  molecules  by [CONTACT_218483]-3 on immature  dendritic  cells 
(DCs) may lead to inhibition  of maturation  and decreased  costimulatory  capacity19. Treg 
cells can produce  several  suppressive  proteins  including  IL-10, IL -35, granzyme  B, IL-9, 
and TGF-β20. Treg  cells are capable  of killing  effector  T cells and antigen  presenting  cells 
(APC)21,22. In a model of infection,  Treg cells have  also been shown  through their influence  
on DCs to play a critical role  in the homeostasis  of CD8+ T cell priming  by [CONTACT_253587]23. 
Treg cells were  originally  characterized  as CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes  and subsequently  
found  to specifically express  the forkhead/winged  helix family  transcription  factor  
Foxp3.24,25 Treg cell differentiation and function  are dependent on  the expression of  the 
lineage -specifying transcription  factor  Foxp326. Furthermore, the entire  range  of Treg cell 
functions  depends  on a Foxp3 -dependent  hierarchical  transcriptional  program27-29. Mice  
with a loss-of-function  mutation  in Foxp3  lack functional  Treg cells and develop  lethal  
autoimmunity  and lymphoproliferative  disease  at an early  age28. Similarly  humans  
harboring  mutations  in FOXP3  suffer from  immune  dysregulation,  polyendocrinopathy,  
enteropathy,  X-linked  syndrome  (IPEX)30. Expression  of Foxp3  drives  Treg cell 
differentiation  in the thymus, but they  can also be induced  in the periphery  through  
mechanisms  that involve  TGF  and IL2 31. Accumulating  evidence  demonstrates  that Treg 
cells utilize  components of the specific  immune  response  in which  they are acting, to  
suppress  it. For example,  expression  of the transcription  factor Irf4  is required  for Treg 
cells to be  able to suppress  TH2 responses,  and Irf4 controls  a module  of the Foxp3  
program that contains  20% of its targets32. Similarly,  CXCR3, a target  of Tbet,  is required  
for control of TH1 responses33, and Stat3  for TH17  responses10. These  observations  
suggest that Treg  cells integrate  external  local cues  to modulate  specific  segments  of their 
transcriptomic  programme,  and they do so by  a set of common  regulators  they share  with 
the ongoing  immune  response.

Therapeutic  modulation  of the immune  system  for clinical benefit in  cancer  patients  has 
been  demonstrated  by [CONTACT_253588],  adoptive  T cell transfer,  and autologous  cell-based  vaccines34-37. Treg  cells are 
generally  considered  to be the  most potent  inhibitor of antitumor immunity  and are 
suspected  to be responsible  for the limited  response  rates  to current immun otherapeutic  
regimens11. Analysis  of tumor infiltrating  lymphocyte  (TIL)  subset  composition  has shown  a 
clear  association  between  the composition  of the infiltrate  and patient survival.  TIL 
composed  of primarily  cytotoxic  T cells are generally  associated  with a favorable  
prognosis,  where  as TIL with a predominance  of Treg cells correlate  with poor outcomes38- 
40. 
 
Recruitment  of Treg cells into the tumor microenvironment  is likely  secondary to a number  
of factors. Chemokines  are a superfamily  of chemotactic  cytokines  that control leukocyte  
migration  through  G protein -coupled  receptors on target  cells41. The chemokine  receptor  
CCR4  has been  shown  to be important  for trafficking  of Treg cells and this function  is 
critical  for Treg cell-mediated  suppression  of inflammation42. CCR4  is the  receptor  for CC- 
chemokine ligand  17 (CCL17)  and CCL2243. Chemokines  are considered  to play a role 
both in the recruitment  of immune  and inflammatory  cells for anti-tumor response  and in 
the selective  homing  of neoplastic  B and T cells44. In normal  tissue, CCR4  is known  to be  
selectively  expressed  on a subset of activated  Th2 type CD4+ T cells that produce  
inflammatory cytokines  such  as interleukin  (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and  has garnered  
attention  as a molecular target for the treatment  of allergic  disorders  such  as asthma,  
atopic  dermatitis  or allergic  rhinitis45-49. CCR4  is also expressed  on primed human  Treg 
cells,  activated  natural  killer (NK) cells,  basophils, monocyte s, and platelets50-53. The 
CCR4  ligands,  CCL17 and  CCL22,  share  37% homology, are both encoded  on 
chromosome  16, and  are highly  expressed  in the thymus,  lymph  nodes,  and skin, but  
barely  expressed  in other  tissues44,54. MDC  and TARC  are synthesized mostly  by 
[CONTACT_253589]43,47. 
CCR4  has been  shown  to play a central role  in Treg homing  to the skin where  they 
regulate  local immune  homeostasis  55. Reduced  levels  of skin associated  Treg has been  
found  to coexist  with numerous  immune  related  skin diseases. Circulating  and skin 
CCR4+  Treg have  been  shown  to be  reduced  in patients  with dermatomyositis  56. Treg  
function  has been  found  to be  significantly  impaired  in patients  with toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_253540] -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

TEN in mice  58. Treg may also function  to limit skin related  autoimmunity  as suggested  by 
a reduced  homing  of functional  Treg in patients  with vitiligo  59. Treatment  of human  
subjects  with an anti-CCR4  antibody  has been  shown  deplete  skin associated  Treg, lead  
to an  altered  skin immune  microenvironment,  and potentially  be associated  with skin 
immunopathology  60. The accumulated  data regarding Treg  mediated  immune  
homeostasis  suggests  CCR4  to be  a major  factor  in Treg homing  to the skin and clinical  
studies  involving  interrupting  this mechanism should  account  for this both in monitoring  for 
adverse  events  as well as a potential biomarker  of response.

Accumulation of CCR4+ Treg has been  shown  to occur  in colon  adenocarcinomas  and 
correlates  with a reduced  frequency  of effector T cells61. Ovarian  tumors, Hodgkin  
lymphoma,  and breast cancers  are found  to contain  large  amounts of CCL22  that 
correlates  with the presence  of tumor infiltrating  Treg40,62-64. Treg cell migration can be  
inhibited through  CCR4 blockade65. Activated Treg  cells preferentially  express  CCR4  over 
conventional T cells, which  is important  when  considering  immunotherapeutic  targeting  of 
Treg cells via CCR466,67. A small  molecule  inhibitor  of CCR4  designed  in silico has been  
shown  to prevent the interactio n of CCL22  and CCL17  with CCR4  and consequently  
inhibit  the recruitment  of Treg cells in experimental  models68. Further work  with this 
molecule showed  that CCR4  antagonism could  enhance  dendritic  cell−mediated  CD4+ T 
cell proliferation  in vitro as well as offer potent  adjuvant  activity  in an in vivo viral infection  
model69. Similarly,  in tumor models, CCR4  antagonism  induced  expansion  of antigen  
specific  CD8+ T cells,  and in combination  with vaccination,  promoted  tumor  immunity70. 
Excluding  skin malignancies,  breast cancer  is the most common  cancer among  women  
and the second  leading  cause  of cancer  death in women71. Clinically,  pathologic

traditionally  been  considered  an immunogenic  tumor,  evidence  of tumor infiltrating  
lymphocytes  (TILs)  and their subset  composition  paralleling  disease  progression  suggest  
that the immune  response may be importan t72,73. The clinical relevance  of tumor  infiltrating  
T cells has been  intensively  studied74. An increased  ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells 
correlates  with lymph  node  metastases  and reduced overall  surviva l75. The tumor  
microenvironment can also influence  the recruitment  and regulation  of immune  cells in 
breast  tumors76,77. High levels  of Treg cells in breast  tumors  is associated  with an invasive  
phenotype and  diminished relapse -free as well as overall  survival57,58,60. In addition,  a 
substantial decrease  in the number  of breast  tumor  infiltrating  Treg cells is positively  
associated with a pathological response  to neoadjuvant  chemotherapy56. 
Breast cancer is  a heterogeneous  disease  and is generally  classified  into three  basic  
therapeutic  groups, based  on the expression  of the estrogen  receptor (ER),  progesterone  
receptor  (PR), and  HER278. Triple  negative  breast  cancers  (TNBC),  also known  as basal - 
like breast cancers  lack the expression  of ER, PR,  and HER279. These  tumors  account  for 
up to  15% of all invasive  breast cancers  and are frequently  observed  in patients  with 
BRCA1  germline  mutations  and of African  ancestry.  TNBC  characteristically  are densely  
infiltrated  by [CONTACT_253590]-tumor response, yet  are associated  with a 
more  aggressive  clinical  course  characterized  by [CONTACT_253591]80. This paradox  is hypothesized  to be  secondary to effective  immune  
suppression  by [CONTACT_253592].  
Foxp3  expression  among  tumor infiltrating  lymphocytes  is significantly  associated  with the 
TNBC subtype  of invasive  breast  cancers81. High levels  of Treg cell infiltration  of TNBCs  is 
associated shorter survival82. TNBC  represents  a relevant  target for  immunotherapy  as 
there  is a robust  pre-existing  infiltrate  which  can potentially   mount an anti-tumor response

 immunosuppressive  cytokines  IL-4 and IL-10, and  inhibit  cytokine  production  from CD4+ T 
cells in vitro88. Treg cell infiltration  of gastric  cancers may be in part related  to hypoxia,  a 
feature  common  to many  solid tumors. Treg  cell infiltration  into gastric  cancers  is positively  
correlated  with HIF-1α expression  and supernatants from gastric  cancer  cells cultured  in 
hypoxic  conditions  can induce  the expression  of Foxp3  in naïve  CD4+  T cells via TGF- 
β189. The well-documented  adverse  clinical correlation  of Treg cell infiltration  into gastric  
cancers,  and the preliminary  evidence  that they may be sensitive  to immunotherapy  
provide  the rationale  for targeting  this disease  with KW-0761.  
 
Lung  cancer is  the leading  cause of cancer deaths  worldwide.  The overall  5-year survival  
rate for advanced  non-small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  is 2%-4%, depending  on 
geographic  location90. Whereas  renal cell  carcinoma and melanoma  are traditionally  
considered  immunogenic,  as evidenced  by [CONTACT_253593]-dose  IL-2, NSCLC has been  notoriously  resistant to 
immunotherapy91,92.  Pre-clinical data suggest that the immune  system may  have  a role in 
this disease. High  levels  of CD4+/CD8+ T cells infiltrating  resected  NSCLC tumors  are 
associated  with a favorable  prognosis  and high levels  of infiltrating  Treg cells are 
associated with increased  risk of relapse93,94. In early -stage  NSCLC the ratio of Treg cells 
to CD3+  TILs correlates  with disease  specific  survival  and can reliably  distinguish  patients  
with tumors  who are at high risk for recurrence95,96. Genetic  evidence  pointing  to the role of 
Treg cells in the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_253542] a single  nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP)  associated  with Graves  disease  in a cohort of 
patients  with NSCLC and healthy  controls.  The study  demonstrated  a significant  
association of this SNP with a risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_253543]97. Recently  there have  been  
significant breakthroughs  in harnessing  the immune  system though  the use of checkpoint  
blockade  inhibitory antibodies  to treat NSCLC.  In a Phase  I dose  escalation  study of 207 
patients  treated  with an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody,  a response  rate of 10% was 
observed in  patients  with NSCLC98. Another  Phase  I dose -escalation  study  of 296 patients  
treated  with an anti-PD-1 antibody  reported  a response  rate of 18% in patients  with 
NSCLC99. Based  on the association  of Treg cells with the clinical course  of NSCLC  
patients  as well as the  significant  pool of proof -of-principle  clinical data  that immune

ded: [ADDRESS_308451] cancer  carcinogenesis101. To determine  the role of 
Treg cells in this process,  we orthotopi[INVESTIGATOR_253544]  1x105 PyMT  tumor  cells in the 
inguinal mammary  glands  of Foxp3DTR mice  which,  when  left untreated,  developed  
uniformly  growing  mammary tumors  that metastasized  to the  lungs  with complete  
penetrance  in approximately  3 to 4 weeks.  If Treg  cells were  ablated  by [CONTACT_253594] 25 
μg/kg  of DT on 2 consecutive  days  after tumor  reached  approximately  100 mm3, the 
primary  tumor  growth  of large  established  tumors  was significantly  hindered  (Fig. 1). In 
addition,  this treatment  also resulted in  the almost complete  disappearance  of metastatic  
tumor  nodules  in the lungs  (Fig. 2). Analysis  of TILs by [CONTACT_253595] a dramatic  increase  in the proportion  of TILs represented  by [CONTACT_398]4+ 
and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3A,B), as well as an  increase  in activated  CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3B,C).  
This finding  again  supports  the hypothesis  that Treg cells actively  suppress  potentially  
beneficial endogenous  anti-tumor immune  responses.  
 
Unfortunately,  there  are no readily  available  means  of selectively  targeting  Treg cells in 
humans. Preclinical models  support the notion  that Treg  cells are central  to the regulation  
of immune  responses  to many  different types  of cancer.  Our own preliminary data  reveal  
that the specific  ablation  of Treg cells in advanced  murine  breast tumors leads  to a 
significant delay  in tumor  growth  and reduction  in metastatic  burden.  These  data suggest  
targeting  Treg cells with KW-0761  may be useful  in the treatment of a wide variety  of 
cancers and  support  its evaluation  in this study.

 lymphoma  (CTCL),  and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma  (ATL).  KW-0761  was produced  
using  technology  developed  by [CONTACT_253597]., Ltd., that eliminates  fucose  from 
the carbohydrate  structure  of the antibody.  It contains  2 heavy  and 2 light chains  linked  
together  by 16 disulfide  bonds. Glycosylation  of KW -0761 occurs at amino  acid Asn299  
and the mAb has typi[INVESTIGATOR_253545]  a core fucose.  KW-0761  has a 
molecular  weight of ~149,000  Daltons  and an isoelectric  point (pI) range  of ~8.1 to 8.7. 
Due to the absence  of fucose  from the complex -type oligosaccharide  at the constant (Fc)  
region,  KW-0761  has enhanced  antibody -dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity (ADCC)  activity,  
but does  not exhibit  any complement  dependent cytotoxic  (CDC)  activity  or neutralizing  
activity  of the ligand  of CCR4.  In vitro, the EC50  for ADCC  against human  T-cell 
lymphoma  cell lines is between  0.01 and 0.1 μg/ml.

shown  in in vivo non-clinical studies  to eliminate the  T-helper 2 (Th2) subset  of T cells that 
express  this chemokine  receptor.  When  compared  to conventional T cells CCR4  is 
preferentially  expressed  in Treg,  both in mice and humans66,67. KW-0761  therefore is a 
promising  immunotherapeutic  agent  targeting  Treg induced  immunosuppression  in the 
tumor microenvironment.  There  is substantial preliminary  data in the published  work  on 
KW-0761  that suggests  it can target  Treg.  A recently  published  phase II study  of KW-0761  
for relapsed  ATL showed  that compared  to healthy  controls, KW -0761  led to a significant  
and lasting  decrease  in the  number  of CD4+CCR4+ but not  CD4+CCR4- or CD8+CD4- cells 
in patients  with ATL (Fig. 4)102. Further  subset  analysis  of CD4 T cells showed  that there  
was a significant depletion  of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells,  which  included  both ATL cells and 
endogenous  non-ATL Treg. The ability  of KW-0761  to deplete Treg  was also examined  in 
a phase  I/II clinical trial in patients  with cutaneous  T cell-lymphoma  (CTCL)103. KW-0761  
in these patients  led to a significant reduction  in circulating  Treg as well as Foxp3  mRNA  
as compared  to pretreatment levels  (Fig 5).

This is a Phase  I/II single  institution  study. Phase  I of the study  will be an open  label,  non- 
randomized,  dose  escalation,  and safety study  in adults  with histologically  confirmed  
metastatic  solid tumor  malignancies.  Subjects  who sign an Informed  Consent form  and 
who meet the eligibility  criteria will be enrolled  to receive  a weekly  intravenous  (IV) dose  of 
KW-0761  ranging  from 0.5 mg/kg  to 10.0 mg/kg  as feasible  starting  on Day [ADDRESS_308455]  of an infusion  every  
other  week  (Figure  6). Following  the end of treatment or treatment  completion  date,  a 24- 
week  short term follow -up (STFU) period  of observation  will begin.  If a subject  
discontinues  from the study for reasons  other than  DLT prior to receivi ng four complete  
infusions  (Week  4), the subject will be replaced.  Subsequent treatment courses  are 
permissible  for subjects  demonstrating  a response  or maintaining  stable  disease  and will 
consist  of an infusion  of KW-[ADDRESS_308456] dose  (Figure  6). Telephonic

Phase  II of the study  will enroll  a total of 48 subjects, 16 patients  in 3 tumor -specific  
expansion  cohorts  each  treated at the RP2D (MTD,  or highest dose  tested in  Phase  I part 
of trial).  The [ADDRESS_308458] adenocarcinoma  (TNBC).  
 
The following  definition  will be used  to identify  TNBC  subjects:  
 
• <1% immunohistochemical staining  for the estrogen  receptor AND  
 
• <1% immunohistochemical staining  for the progester one receptor AND  
 
• 0-1+on  IHC staining  for HER2  or FISH  not amplified  as per the ASCO/CAP  
guidelines  (single -probe  average  HER2  copy  number <4.0  signals/cell;  dual-probe  
HER2/CEP17  ratio <2.0 with an average  HER2  copy  number <4.0 signals/cell).  
 
These  cohorts  were  chosen  because  they are abundantly  infiltrated  by [CONTACT_253599], the 
proposed  target  of KW-0761  (Section 3.0,  Background  and Rationale)  104-106. As the Phase

1Since  the bowel  habits  of individual  subjects  may vary widely  it is likely  that not all of  the collections  may be possible.  Subjects  are to bring  in samples  when  feasible.  If a 
subject  misses  collections  they will be allowed  to continue  on the study.  
 
2If a site of tumor  is readily  available  as a cutaneous  lesion  a simple  punch  or excisional  biopsy  under  local  anesthesia  can be performed  by [CONTACT_62674]  [INVESTIGATOR_253548].  If however  tumor  is not as readily  accessible  then an image -guided  core needle  biopsy  will be obtained  following  consultation  with the radiology  staff to 
determine  the overall  risk of the procedure.  Invasive  procedures  that require  general  anesthesia  should  not be performed  to obtain  a biopsy  specimen.  If a surgical  procedure  
is performed  for a clinical  indication  a sample  may be used  for research  purposes.  During  the course  of treatment  a decision  may be made  to perform  the post-treatment  
biopsy  earlier  than [ADDRESS_308468]  a possibility  that by [CONTACT_4475] 15 there  will be no available  tumor  for biopsy  due to a rapid  clinical  response.  Similarly  
tumor  biopsy  may be delayed  if there  is evidence  of a delayed  response.

 4.5.2  Physical  Examination  
 
Complete  physical examinations  will be performed  at Screening/Baseline  to document that  candidates  
meet all  eligibility  criteria  and will be repeated  weekly  during  the core study  period  and with every short - 
term follow -up visit. Height  will be recorded  at Baseline.  Weight  will be recorded  at Baseline, at the end 
of Cycle  [ADDRESS_308471].  
 
4.5.3  Electrocardiogram  (ECG)  
 
A 12-lead ECG will be obtained  and recorded  at Screening  Baseline  (Days  -35 to -1) and prior to the 
initial  KW-0761dose. Additional ECGs  will be obtained  only as clinically  indicated.

Amended:  17-AUG -[ADDRESS_308477]  will be provided  as an injectable  solution, contained  in single -use, 
ready -to-use 10 mL vials.  Each vial contains  5 mL of a 4 mg/mL  solution  of KW-[ADDRESS_308478]’s  weight.  If the subject’s  body  weight  changes  10% or more  at any time during  the study  
relative  to Day 1, subsequent  doses  of the study  drug should  be adjusted  relative  to the new 
weight.  
 
The appropriate  volume  of KW-0761  based  on weight will be withdrawn  and diluted  into 
normal saline  (NS, 0.9% sodium  chloride). KW -0761  can be  diluted  with normal saline  to various  
concentrations  ranged  (0.07  to 1.44 mg/mL  in a 250-mL bag; 0.19 to 2.40 mg/mL  in a

other  monoclonal antibodies.  More  subjects  in the Japanese  studies  experienced  infusion  reactions

59% of subjects  (16 subjects)  in the Phase  2 Study 0761 -002 (8 doses  given  weekly).  The incidence  
and severity of the rashes  observed  in subjects  in Japan is notably  greater than  what has been  
observed  in the study  conducted  in the US. This  may be related  to differences  in the dosing  regimen,  
differences  in underlying  biology  of the malignancies  and/or  differences  in

the underlying  genetic  predispositions  (most  subjects  in Japan  had ATL,  while  all but one in the US had 
CTCL). In the [ADDRESS_308487] in  a Phase  1 study  in asthma  (Study 20080407)  developed  a 
Grade  2 psoriasiform rash  after receiving  a single  dose  of KW-0761  (0.6 mg) administered  
subcutaneously.  
 
Most  rashes  observed  in the studies  in T-cell lymphomas  have  been  characterized  as spongiotic  
dermatitis, although  there  has been  some  variability  in presentation.  The rash observed  in the subject  
with asthma  was characterized  as psoriasiform. There  is also great  variability  in the time to onset of 
rash among  subjects. The  majority of subjects  with ATL and CTCL/PTCL have  underlying  skin 
involvement  and dysregulated  skin immunity  as a result  of the underlying  lymphoma/leukemia.  
Although  the mechanism is  unclear in  terms  of how skin rashes  develop  in these  oncology  subjects,  
rash appears  to be manageable  by [CONTACT_253602]-0761  or adding  topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or  oral

hepatitis  core antibody. Repeat  testing  confirmed  that HBs antigen  and HBs antibody  were  both 
negative  prior to antibody  treatment.  The protocol  did not require  testing  for hepatitis  B core antibody  or 
HBV-DNA  at the time the subject was enrolled  in the study.  The protocol  was subsequently  amended  to 
require  such  testing  to prevent  HBV activation  in other  subjects.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Potential research  subjects  will be identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment team,  the protocol  
investigator,  or research  team at Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  (MSKCC).  If the investigator  
is a member  of the treatment team, s/he  will screen  their patient’s  medical records  for suitable  research  
study  participants  and discuss  the study  and their potential  for enrolling  in the research  study.  Potential  
subjects  contact[CONTACT_253604]/research  staff of the 
study.  
 
The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_253555]  
a treatment relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be eligible  to enroll in 
the study  and to record  appropriate  contact [CONTACT_253605].  
 
During  the initial conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff and  the patient,  the patient may  
be asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary  to the recruitment  and enrollment  
process. The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical records  at MSKCC  in 
order  to further  assess  eligibility.  They  will use the information  provided  by [CONTACT_17491]/or  medical  
record  to confirm that the patient is  eligible  and to contact [CONTACT_28630]. If the 
patient turns  out to be  ineligible  for the research  study,  the research  staff will destroy  all information  
collected  on the patient during  the initial conversation  and medical  records  review,  except for any 
information  that must be maintained  for screening  log purposes.

process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal risk  to the privacy  of the patients  who are screened  
and minimal PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. For these  reasons,  we seek  a (partial)  
limited  waiver  of authorization  for the purposes  of (1) reviewing  medical  records  to identify  potential  
research  subjects  and obtain  information  relevant to the enrollment process;  (2) conversing  with 
patients  regarding  possible  enrollment; (3) handling  of PHI contained  within  those  records  and provided  
by [CONTACT_41907]; and  (4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of patients  approached  (if 
applicable).  
 
Before  being  enrolled, subjects  must  consent to participate  after the nature,  scope, and  possible  
consequences  of the study  have  been explained  in a form understandable  to them.  An informed  
consent for m will be prepared  and given  to the subject. This  document will contain  all the elements  
required  by [CONTACT_253607] [ADDRESS_308506]'s  consent must  be confirmed  at the time of consent  by [CONTACT_253608].  
 
A copy  of the consent document and  any other  subject -specific  information  reviewed  as part  of the 
consent  process  must  be given  to the subject The original  signed  consent document will be retained  by 
[CONTACT_737].  
 
If the subject is  unable  to read,  oral presentation  and explanation  of the patient  information  sheet  and 
the informed  consent form  and any information  to be supplied  to subjects  must  take place  in the 
presence of an impartial  witness.  Consent must  be confirmed  at the time of consent orally  and by [CONTACT_253609] a local legally recognized  alternative  (e.g.,  the 
subject's  thumbprint  or mark). The witness  to the informed  consent  discussions  must  also sign and 
personally  date the consent  document.  
 
The Investigator  will not undertake  any measures  required  for the clinical study  until valid consent  has 
been  obtained.  
 
This protocol will take due notice  of NIH/ADAMHA  policies  concerning  inclusion  of women  and 
minorities  in clinical research  populations.  We expect  that the study  population  will be fully 
representative  of the range  of patients  referred  for treatment  without  exclusion  as to age, gender, or 
ethnic background. Pregnant  women  are excluded  from participation  in this study.  
 
This cost of this study  will be covered  by a combination  of funds  from Kyowa  Hakko  Kirin Pharma,  
grants  awarded  to the Co-Principal  Investigator,  and additional  funding  from the Ludwig  Institute  for

9.3.1  Dose  Limiting  Toxicity  
 
The occurrence  of the following  toxicities  will be considered  a DLT,  if judged  by [CONTACT_253610],  probably  or definitely  related  to study  drug administration:  
 
The definition  of DLT is any > Grade  3 hematologic  or non-hematologic  toxicity that  is related  to 
treatment.  
 
Exceptions : 
 
The following  are exceptions  to the definition  and will  be considered  a DLT if: 
 
• Grade  4 neutropenia  > 7 days  
• Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  
• Grade  3 thrombocytopenia  associated  with clinically  significant bleeding  
 
 
In the case  of Grade  2 immune  related  adverse  events  (irAE, defined  below)  study  drug administration  
will be delayed  until event  diminishes  to Grade  1 or less. 
 
Immune  related  Adverse  Events  
 
An irAE is defined  as a clinically  significant  adverse  event  of any organ  that is  associated with study  
drug exposure, of unknown  etiology,  and is consistent with an immune -mediated  mechanism.  
Serologic, immunologic, and  histologic  (biopsy)  data should  be used  to support  an irAE diagnosis.  
Appropriate  efforts  should  be made  to rule out neoplastic,  infectious,  metabolic,  toxin,  or other etiologic  
causes  of the irAE.  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL

Amended:  17-AUG -2016  
Page  37 of 63  
 Given  the intended  mechanism  of action  of KW-0761,  particular attention  will be given  to adverse  
events  that may follow  enhanced  T-cell activation  such as dermatitis  and colitis,  endocrinopathies, or 
other  irAEs.  
 
9.3.2  Infusion  Reactions: Grading  and Management  
 
Intravenous  administration  of biologic  agents  carries  a potential  risk of hypersensitivity reactions.  
Infusion  reactions  will be graded  according  to the National  Cancer Institute  (NCI)  Common  Terminology  
Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  4.03.  
 
Table  5 outlines  the infusion  reaction  grading  system,  associated  symptoms,  and the recommended  
actions  to be  taken  regarding  treatment. Reactions  occurring  within  24 hours  after the start of KW-0761  
infusion  will be considered  to be infusion  related  AEs. Premedication  with acetaminophen  650 mg orally  
and diphenhydramine  50 mg i.v.  or other  antihistamine  will be administered  to all subjects.  
 
As with all AEs, infusion -related  signs  or symptoms  which,  in the Investigator's  judgment,  are not 
related  to hypersensitivity  reactions  (e.g.,  dyspepsia,  urinary  frequency, etc.)  should  be recorded  and 
graded  as AEs according  to NCI CTCAE  v.4.03  criteria  in CRDB. Based  on nonclinical in  vitro and in 
vivo data,  KW-0761  administration  is not expected  to cause  cytokine  release  syndrome  (CRS).  
Although  there  is significant  overlap  in the clinical presentations  of anaphylaxis  and CRS  and either can 
occur  during  or within  2 hours  of completion  of infusion  of biologic  agents, some  symptoms,  such  as 
arthralgia  and chills,  are more  likely  to be due to CRS than anaphylaxis.  The NCI CTCAE  v.4.03  will be 
used  to grade  and report infusion  reactions  consistent with CRS.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_253557] a specific  toxicity  if it is clearly  unrelated  to KW-0761 infusion  (e.g.,  
laceration, burn,  or similar  accidental trauma  unrelated  to some  other infusion -related  AE).

therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding), symptom,  
or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of an investigational  product, whether  or not related  to 
the product.  
 
All AEs will be evaluated  and reported  according  to the NCI CTCAE  v.4.03.  
 
9.4.2  Treatment Emergent  Adverse  Event  
 
A treatment -emergent adverse  event  (TEAE) is  an AE that begins  or that worsens  in severity  after the  
start of the first exposure  to KW-0761. Only  TEAEs  will be recorded  in CRDB.  For the purposes  of this 
study,  the terms  "AE" and "TEAE" may be used  interchangeably.  Adverse  events  that occur during  the 
Screening  and Baseline  periods  are not treatment  emergent  and will be recorded  in the subject's  
medical records, but not in CRDB.  
 
An illness  present  at study entry  is considered  a pre-existing  condition, not an AE. Pre-existing  
conditions  will be recorded  in CRDB. If  a subject experiences  clinically  relevant  worsening  of a pre- 
existing  condition  after any KW-[ADDRESS_308522]  medical occurrence  that: 
 
1. Results  in death,  
 
2. Is life-threatening,A 
 
3. Requires  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088],  
 
4. Results  in persistent  or significant disability  or incapacity,  
 
5. Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect,  and/or  
 
6. Is another  medically  important  conditionB 
 
A. The term "life -threatening" in  the definition  of "serious" refers  to an event in  which  the subject is  at 
risk of death  at the time of the event; it does  not refer to an event, which  hypothetically  might  have

 caused  death  if it were  more  severe. The term "severe"  is often  used  to describe  the intensity  (severity)  
of an event  (such  as: mild, moderate, or severe,  e.g., pain). The event  itself may be of relatively  minor  
medical  significance  (such  as severe  headache). This  is not the same  as "serious",  which  is based  on 
subject/event  outcome  or action  criteria  usually associated  with events  that pose  a threat to the 
subject's  life or vital functions.  Seriousness  (not severity)  serves  as a guide  for defining  regulatory  
reporting  obligations.  
 
B. Medically  important conditions  that may not result  in death, but may be immediately  life-threatening  
or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253562],  based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the subject  or may require  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in the 
definition  above.  Examples  of such  events  are intensive  treatment in  an emergency  room or at home  for 
allergic  bronchospasm; blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  or 
development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
 
Reporting  requirements  for SAEs  are described  in Section  9.4. 
 
9.4.4  Relationship to KW-0761  
 
The relationship  of all AEs to KW-0761  will be determined  by [CONTACT_253612], using  one of the following  terms  (in accordance  with NCI Guideline  "Expedited  Adverse  
Event  Reporting  Requirements  for NCI Investigational Agents",  NCI Cancer Therapy  Evaluation  
Program, January 2001):  
 
Definitely  related (The AE is clearly  related  to the investigational  agent)  
Probably  related  (The AE is likely  related  to the investigational  agent)  
Possibly  related  (The AE may be related  to the investigational  agent)  
Unlikely  related  (The AE is doubtfully  related  to the investigational  agent)  
Unrelated  (The AE is clearly  not related  to the investigational agent)  
N.B.:  When  making  the assessment  of causality,  it should  be taken  into consideration  that 
immunomodulatory  agents  have  the potential  to cause late and/or  permanent  effects  on the immune  
system,  i.e., a causal  relationship  could  exist despi[INVESTIGATOR_040]  a lack of apparent temporal  relationship.  
Information  provided  in the IB and/or  in this protocol may support  these  evaluations.

Subjects will be monitored  at the  investigative  site according  to the schedule  of assessments  outlined  in 
Table  2. Additional  assessments  to evaluate  and/or treat  any AEs may be performed  at the discretion  of 
the Principal  Investigator.  In the event that  a subject  will need  to undergo  palliative  surgery  or radiation,  
the schedule  of dosing  and assessments  will be modified  to allow  for the treatment to be administered.  
The adjustments  will be made  in coordination  with the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_253564]’s  
physicians.

9.5.3  Definition  of Maximum  Tolerated  Dose  (MTD)  and definition  of Maximal Dose  Level  
 
The MTD  is defined  as the dose  below  that dose  at which  at least [ADDRESS_308525] cohort  will 
be 0.5 mg/kg. In the absence  of a DLT,  dose  will be escalated  as indicated  in the  cohorts  listed  in Table

 9.11 Pharmacodynamic  Assessments  
 
Pharmacodynamic  assessments  will be performed  on all patients  in this study.  Available  research  blood  
and tumor samples  will be delivered  to the Immune  Monitoring  Facility  (IMF) for processing  and 
cryopreservation.   Available  stool samples  will be similarly  brought to the Molecular  Microbiology  Core  
Facility.  Subjects will bring  in samples  when  feasible.   It is understood  that the bowel habits  of subjects  
will vary widely  and as such it is likely  that not all collections  are possible,  if this is the case subjects  will 
be allowed  to continue  on study.  
 
If a site  of tumor  is readily  available  as a cutaneous  lesion  a simple  punch  or excisional biopsy  under  
local anesthesia  can be performed  by [CONTACT_22888]-principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_253565]. If  tumor is as 
readily  accessible  then an image -guided  core needle  biopsy  will be obtained  following  consultation  with 
the radiology  staff to determine  the overall  risk of the procedure. Invasive  procedures  that require  
general anesthesia  should  not be performed  to obtain  a biopsy  specimen. If  a surgical procedure  is 
performed  for a clinical indication  a sample  may be used  for research  purposes.  During  the course  of 
treatment  a decision  may be made  to perform the  post-treatment biopsy  earlier  than [ADDRESS_308527]  a delayed  response.  
 
Tumor tissue  obtained  from biopsies  will be divided  equally  for fresh  frozen  paraffin  embedding  and 
cryopreservation  by [CONTACT_253614]. 
9.11.1  CCR4+ T cell depletion  
The degree  of depletion  of CCR4+ T cells by [CONTACT_253615]-0761  will be determined  by [CONTACT_4133]. The 
proportion of CCR4+ T cells to other  T cell subsets  as well as the  concentration  in a fixed  volume  of

messenger  will bring  the samples  to the IMF from the ITC. The  sample  will need  to arrive  to the ITC 
within  6 hours of blood  draw.  
 
Serologic  assays  using  multiplexed  ELISA  to determine  antibody  titers  to tumor -associated  antigens  will 
also be performed  by [CONTACT_253614]. Theses  assays  are used  to estimate  the titer of antibodies  specific  to one

 tissue is  present. Flow  cytometric  assessment  of the lymphocyte subsets  CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+ 
and CD56+  will be examined  as percent  and absolute  number. FOXP3+ and FOXP3- lymphocytes  with 
the following  markers  will also include  but not limited  to: CD4+, CD25,  CD45RA,  CD45RO, LAG3,  
GARP,  PD1, and  CTLA4.  Activation  markers  such  as CD44  and CD69,  will also be examined.  These  
assays  will take place  in the Immune  Monitoring  Facility (IMF).  
 
In order to determine  if the depletion  of Treg cells has an effect  on pre-existing  immunity  to multiple  
non-tumor antigens,  PBMC  will be analyzed  with a panel  of HLA tetramers  to common  antigens  
including  those  used  in routine  vaccinations. This  will be done  in collaboration  with [CONTACT_253649] of the Netherlands  Cancer Institute  who has developed  and validated  the panel  of HLA- 
Tetramers. In order  to choose  tetramers  that are specific  to the individual  patients  HLA,  a sample  of 
PBMCs  will undergo  HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_253566].  The samples  that will be sent to The

Archival tumor  biopsy  material  if present  may be examined  for biomarkers of interest and/or  infiltrating  
immune  cells and their presence  or absence  correlated  with observed  clinical  outcomes.  If such  an 
analysis  is planned  a separate  tissue  procurement  protocol  will be submitted  for review.

dosing  at Week  8, and every  eight  weeks  thereafter. Clinical staging  will be documented  at 
Baseline/Screening  and repeated  and documented  at Day 15 of Cycle  2, and every  2 cycles  thereafter.  
When  possible, tumor progression  will be assessed  according  to irRC at Baseline,  at Day 15 of Cycle  2, 
and every 2 cycles  thereafter, and  as data are availa ble and/or  clinically  indicated - during  Long -term 
Follow -up 108,109. See Appendix  I for detailed monitoring criteria.  
If possible  a tumor biopsy  will be obtained  at Baseline  and at Day 15 (+/- 4 days)  from all subjects.  
Qualified  personnel  trained  in the  procedure  will take the tumor biopsy. If a site  of tumor is  readily  
available  as a cutaneous  lesion  a simple  punch  or excisional  biopsy  under  local anesthesia  can be 
performed  by [CONTACT_253623].  If tumor is not readily  accessible  then an 
image -guided  core needle  biopsy  will be obtained  following  consultation  with the radiology  staff to  
determine  the overall  risk of the procedure. Invasive  procedures  that require  general anesthesia  should  
not be performed  to obtain  a biopsy  specimen.  If a surgical procedure  is performed  for a clinical  
indication  a sample  may be used  for research  purposes.  During  the course  of treatment a decision  may 
be made  to perform the post-treatment  biopsy  earlier  than [ADDRESS_308541] a 
possibility  that by [CONTACT_4475] 15 there  will be no available  tumor  for biopsy  due to a rapid  clinical response.  
Similarly  tumor  biopsy  may be delayed  if there  is evidence  of a delayed  response.  
 
From  the biopsy  specimens,  immune  cell subsets  including  dendritic  cells, T and  B lymphocytes  will be 
evaluated  by [CONTACT_253624],  activation,  and maturation  status.  Isolation  of 
individual  populations  of lymphocytes  or tumor  cells may be performed  for gene  expression analysis  
and DNA/RNA  sequencing.  Additional correlative  exploratory immunologic  studies  including,  but not 
limited  to, enumerating  and characterizing  circulating  cytokines,  immu ne cells,  and tumor  cells will be 
performed.

legally  authorized  representative)  decide  to withdraw,  all efforts  will be made  to complete  and report the 
observations  as thoroughly  as possible.  
 
A complete  final evaluation  should  be made  at the time of withdrawal  with an explanation  of why the 
subject  is withdrawing.  An attempt should  be made  to perform  a follow -up study  visit at the  time of 
withdrawal.  This discussion  will be documented  in the EMR.  
 
Subjects  may be removed  from study  if one or more  of the following  occur:  
 
• Significant protocol  violation  by [CONTACT_737].  
• Significant subject noncompliance.  
• Refusal of the subject to continue  treatment  or observations.  
• Disease  recurrence  or progression  that prevents  further  participation.  
• Investigator decides  that termination  is in the subject's  best medical interest.  
• Lost to follow -up.

This phase  I/II trial to determine  the maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  of mogamulizumab  (KW-0761)  in 
patients  with advanced  and/or  metastatic  solid tumors.  A standard  3+3  design  will be utilized  to 
determine  the MTD.  Four dose  levels  of KW-0761  will be investigated  (0.5mg/kg,  1mg/kg,  3mg/kg,  
10mg/kg).  Patients  will be treated  in cohorts  of size three  to six and the dosage  will be escalated  if the 
clinical toxicity  is acceptable.  Toxicity  severity will  be graded according  to the CTCAE  (ver. 4.03).  
 
A dose -limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  will be defined  as any toxicity  that does  not have  a clear -cut alternative  
explanation.  Any of the following,  specified  below,  will be considered  a DLT:  
> Grade  3 non-hematologic  toxicity  
> Grade  3 hematologic  toxicity  
> Grade  3 allergic  reaction/hypersensitivity  reaction  (including  drug fever)  
> Grade  3 cytokine  release  syndrome/acute  infusion  reaction  
 
The following  are exceptions  to Dose -Limiting  Toxicity  
For neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia, the following  criteria  must be met to be considered  a DLT:  
 
Grade  4 neutropenia  lasting  >[ADDRESS_308545] 7 days  for 
this toxicity  to represent  a DLT.  
 
The design  is constructed  to reduce  the chance  of escalating  the dose  when  the probability  of DLT is 
high,  and increase  the chance  of escalating  the dose  when  the probability  of DLT is low. The maximum  
tolerated  dose  (MTD)  is defined  as the highest  dose  level where  a DLT occurs  within  at most  one out of 
six patients  treated.  The escalation  scheme  is as follows:  
 
(1) If none  of the initial  three  patients  in a cohort  experiences  a DLT,  then a new cohort  of three  
patients  will be treated  at the next higher dose  level.

IRB PROTOCOL

Page  50 of 63  
 (2) If one of the three  patients  in a cohort  experiences  a DLT,  then up to three  additional  
patients  will be treated  at the same  dose.  Escalation  will continue  if only one of the six patients  
experiences  DLT.  
 
(3) If two or more  patients  in a cohort  experience  DLT,  then the MTD  will have  been  exceeded,  
and no further dose  escalation  will occur.  The previous  dose  level will be considered  the MTD.  
 
(4) If only three  patients  were  treated  at a dose  level under  consideration  as the MTD,  then up 
to three  additional  patients  will be accrued.  If no more  than one of the six patients  at that dose  
level experience  a DLT,  then that dose  level will be confirmed  as the MTD.  If two or more  
patients  in that cohort  experience  DLT,  then the previous  dose  level will be studied  in the same  
fashion.  
 
The MTD  is defined  as the highest  dose  studied  for which  the observed  incidence  of DLT is less than 
33%.   Frequencies  of toxicities  will be tabulated  according  to the NCI Common  Toxicity  Criteria.  
 
Table  7 below  gives  the probabilities  of dose  escalation  based on  true DLT risk in the 3+3 design.

Phase  II portion:  Additional  patients  will be accrued  to the disease  specific  expansion  cohorts  at the 
MTD  for evaluation  of safety,  tolerability,  pharmacodynamics,  and activity  potential  in the Phase  II 
portion.  The diseases  included  in these  cohorts  include  triple -negative  breast  carcinoma,  non-small  cell 
lung carcinoma,  and gastric  adenocarcinoma  for which  there  will be cohort  sizes  of [ADDRESS_308546]  a response  if they had not received  any 
therapy  and the response  rate (RR)  for subjects  treated  with KW-0761  would  be 10%.  A one-sample  
exact  binomial  test will be used  in testing  the alternative  hypothesis  Ha: RR with treatment = 10% against  the 
null hypothesis  H0: RR without  treatment = 0.1%.  A sample  size of 16 evaluable  subjects  is required  to provide  
more  than 80% power  in a one-sample  exact  Binomial  test at the significance  level of 0.05.  If one 
response  is observed  out of 16 patients  in a particular  cohort  then the treatment  will be considered  
worthy  of further  study  in that cohort.  
 
The 10% response  rate was chosen  based  on the response  rates  observed  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  arguably

14.2 1 Pharmacodynamic  Analysis  
 
Correlative  studies  will be performed  on biologic  specimens  obtained  from subjects  in the Phase  I and 
Phase  II portions  of this trial. 
 
Flow  cytometric  results  for lymphocyte  subsets  and CCR4+  T cell counts  will be tabulated  and 
presented  graphically  by [CONTACT_253626].  The results  of other PD  assessments  (will be summarized  
using  descriptive  statistics.  
 
Treg cells constitute  a significant  proportion  of TILs and based  on their potent immunoregulatory  
properties  we hypothesize  that Treg  cell depletion  will lead to significant alteration  in the tumor immune  
microenvironment.  A tumor  biopsy  will be obtained  at Baseline  and at Day 15 and investigated  for the 
extent  and consequences  of Treg depletion.  The tumor biopsy  will be taken  by [CONTACT_253627].  In these  specimens,  immune  cells and cell subsets  including  dendritic  cells,  
and T and B lymphocytes  as well as their subsets  will be qualitatively  and quantitatively  evaluated  by 
[CONTACT_253628],  activation,  and maturation  status.  Phenotypic  analysis  of TILs by [CONTACT_253629]  T cells 
and myeloid  cells.  Activation  state  of CD4 and CD8 T cells will be determined  by [CONTACT_253630] (T -BET, GATA3,  FOXP3, RORC)  as well as intracellular  cytokine  analysis  
following  in vitro re-stimulation.  Correlative  exploratory immunologic  studies  including, but not limited  to, 
circulating  cytokines, circulating  immune  cells, and tumor cells  will be performed.  
 
Treg cells are critical  mediators  of peripheral  tolerance  and their complete  absence  leads  to 
autoimmunity  in animal  models  and in human  patients  with Foxp3  deficiency.  CCR4+  Treg cells 
represent  a subset  of activated  Treg cells and Treg cells capable  of migrating  to the skin. Specific  
depletion  of Treg cells induced  by [CONTACT_253615]-0761  will provide  a unique  opportunity  to characterize  the 
consequences  of Treg cell depletion  not only for the tumor  growth, but also for systemic  immune  
activation  and the homeostasis  of a normal  tissue.  If during  the course  of treatment  with KW-0761  there  
is a clinical evident focus  of skin pathology  it will be targeted  for biopsy  as well as nearby  [CONTACT_37266].

 The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database  at MSKCC.  Data from this  trial 
will be entered  in the Clinical research  Database  (CRDB).  Source  documentation  will be available  to 
support the computerized  patient record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data. Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  
periodically throughout the  study  period.  
 
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362], at a 
minimum of two times  per year, more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 2 Data and  Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at MSKCC  were  approved  by [CONTACT_253631] 2001. The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_253632]  “Policy  of the National Cancer  Institute  for Data  and Safety Monitoring  of Clinical Trials” which  
can be found  at: http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  plans  at MSKCC  
were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_28644]. The  MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans  can be  found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at : http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index/htm . 
 
There  are several  different mechanisms  by [CONTACT_28645], safety,  and 
quality. There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification  audits, therapeutic  response, and  staff education  on clinical research  
QA) and  departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  committees that 
are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical trials  programs. The  committees: Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical trials, and  the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
Board  (DSM B) for Phase  III clinical trials, report to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  
Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and  review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its level of risk 
and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every type  of protocol  (e.g. NIH sponsored, in -house  sponsored,  
industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and the monitoring  procedures  will 
be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

17.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct normal life  
functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical Events  (IME)  that may not resul t in death, be life threatening, or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613], based  upon  medical  judgment, they  may 
jeopardize  the patient or subject  and may require  medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one  of 
the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28614] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is required  for 30- 
days  after the participant’s  last investigational treatment. Any  events  that occur after the 30-day period  
and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol treatment must be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  
Events’,  the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar days  of the event. The IRB requires  a 
Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  electronically  to the SAE Office  as 
follows:  
 
For IND/IDE  trials: Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to [EMAIL_440] . All 
other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_2141] . 
 
For all other trials: Reports  that inclu de a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to [EMAIL_440] . All 
other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_203] . 
 
The report should  contain  the following  information:  
Fields  populated  from CRDB:  
• Subject’s  name  (generate  the report with only initials  if it will be sent outside  of

IRB#: 14-135 A(8) 
Amended:  17-AUG -[ADDRESS_308576]  based  immune  related  response  criter ia (irRC)  
 
Antitumor response  based  on total measurable  tumor  burden.  
 
For the irRC,  only index  and measurable  new lesions  are taken  into account (in  contrast to conventional  
criteria, which  do not require  the measurement  of new lesions,  nor do they include  new lesion  measurements  
in the characterization  of evolving  tumor burden).  At the baseline  tumor  assessment, the sum of the products   
of the two largest  perpendicular  diameters  (SPD) of all index  lesions  (five lesions  per organ,  up to 10 visceral  
lesions  and five cutaneous  index  lesions)  is calculated.  At each  subsequent tumor  assessment, the  SPD of the 
index  lesions  and of new, measurable  lesions  (≥5 x 5 mm; up to 5 new  lesions  per organ:  5 new cutaneous  
lesions  and 10 visceral  lesions)  are added  together to provide  the total tumor burden:  
 
Tumor  Burden  = SPD index  lesions  + SPD new, measurable  lesions  
Overall response  using  the irRC.  
The overall  response  according  to the irRC is derived  from time-point response  assessments (based  on tumor  
burden) as follows:  
 
Immune  related  complete  response  (irCR):  complete  disappearance  of all lesions  (whether measurable  or 
not, and  no new lesions) confirmation  by a repeat, consecutive  assessment  no less than [ADDRESS_308577] documented  
 
Immune  related  partial response  (irPR):  decrease  in tumor  burden  ≥30%relative  to baseline  confirmed  by a 
consecutive  assessment at least [ADDRESS_308578] documentation  
 
Immune  related  stable  disease  (irSD):  not meeting  criteria  for irCR or irPR,  in absence  of irPD 
 
Immune  related  progressive  disease  (irPD):  increase  in tumor burden  ≥20% relative  to nadir (minimum  
recorded  tumor burden) confirmation  by a repeat, consecutive  assessment  no less than [ADDRESS_308579] documented  
 
An irRC overall  response  of irCR or irPR requires  confirmation  by a second  (confirmatory) evaluation  meeting  
the criteria  for irRC response  and performed  no less than [ADDRESS_308580] met.

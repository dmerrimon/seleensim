Introduction:  
The optimal method for removal of polyps 6-9 and 10-15 mm in size is not established.  
In recent years, the use of cold resection techniques (resection without the use of electrocautery) 
has been demonstrated to be effective and safer than techniques utilizing electrocautery (hot 
techniques) for diminutive polyps that are 1- [ADDRESS_697324] shown that cold snare 
endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) is non- inferior to hot EMR for [ADDRESS_697325] prior to the removal of a polyp with a snare.  In this study, we propose to evaluate four different treatments for polyps (sized 6mm- 15mm) .  The four treatments are cold snaring

failure rates for 6 -9 mm polyps are shown in the attached table.  
 
 
Methods :  
 
A member  of the research  team  will approach  a potential  subject  to discuss  
participation  in the study,  including  background of  the proposed  study, inclusion  and 
exclusion  criteria,  benefits  and risks of the procedures  and follow -up. If this is of  interest  to 
the subject,  the informed  consent  form  will be  discussed  and presented.  The subject  must  sign 
the consent  form  prior  to enrollment.  
All of the colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_535785]. Douglas Rex  or one of the Sub-
Investigators listed above.  During the procedure, once a polyp has been identified and its size fits 
within the range of the target groups (Group 1: 6 -9mm or Group 2: 10- 15mm), each subject will be 
randomized to one of the four resection techniques in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using a computer generated 
randomization sequence . This treatment will be applied to additional  polyps found within either 
of the target groups (correct size ranges) at the discretion of the physician in that patient. The PI  
[INVESTIGATOR_535786].   
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_535787]. Data  that 
will be assessed from each polyp include its size, a photograph, location of the polyp in the colon, 
shape (Paris classification), removal time (in seconds) of each polyp resection, prediction of 
complete resection, prediction of pathology, actual pathology, and efficacy of resection.  Efficacy 
of resection will be assessed by [CONTACT_535788].   
Subjects will receive a follow -up phone call 30 ± 7 days after their colonoscopy.

v010 Page 3 of 4 24Feb2020  Objectives : 
  The primary endpoint of the study will be the efficacy of resection.  The hypothesis 
centers on hot EMR as the gold standard, with an estimated effective resection rate of 97% 
(Table 1) .  The trial will be powered for non- inferiority, that is, each of the other arms will be 
non-inferior compared to hot EMR within a > 7 % margin2. Complications will be recorded, 
but the study will not be powered for complications.  
The study will help to establish the optimal resection technique for 6-[ADDRESS_697326] compared two of the potential resection methods1-4, no 
previous study has evaluated all four of the resection methods.   
 
Criteria :  
  
Inclusion Criteria:  
 
• Aged 40 years or older 
• Ability to provide informed consent  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
• Subjects with a history of inflammatory bowel disease 
• Lesions less than 6mm or greater than 15mm in largest dimension 
Randomization : 
Once a polyp has been identified and it s size fits within the range of the target groups 
(Group 1: 6-9mm or Group 2: 10- 15mm), each subject will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio  using 
a computer generated randomization sequence. Randomization outcomes include: cold snaring 
without injection, hot snaring without injection, col d EMR, and hot EMR. The randomized 
treatment will be applied to additional polyps found within either of the target groups (correct 
size ranges) at the discretion of the physician in that patient.  
The ra ndomization list will include [ADDRESS_697327] been randomized study -wide.  
Statistical Analysis & Sample Size:  
A sample size of 66 polyps per treatment ( 264 total  subjects ) will have 80% power to 
detect a non-inferiority margin difference of 7% for the cold EMR, hot snare, and cold snare 
treatments compared to the hot EMR treatment with an alpha of 0.05.  
Data Integrity and Safety  
All paper charts pertaining to the patient will be kept under lock and key in 
[ADDRESS_697328] from the endoscopy area. Each VA site will securely transfer their 
data to the main site electronically in a manner that is approved by [CONTACT_439484] (ie 
REDCap, Azure AMS System, faxed over a secure line to research office).  Only de -identified 
data from external sites will be  added to the database (no HIPAA identifiers will be collected 
from external sites besides procedure dates).  Virtual data will be stored on an internal network 
drive with encryption and password security. Only approved personnel by [CONTACT_535789] s to the file storage.  This file will also not have any identifiable patient information.  A 
study log with the identifiable information will be kept in a separate folder to enable the investigators to assist in any research audit. No procedural data except the date of examination 
will be entered into this log. There will be regular back -ups of the data.   
 The Data Safety Monitoring Board will consist of [CONTACT_535792] and [CONTACT_535793]. [CONTACT_535794] will chair the DSMB which will meet every six mont hs to review study related 
data. Additionally, [CONTACT_535795]'s research team will provide him up to date information regarding the 
status of patients and any reportable events.  All SAEs and Unanticipated or Unexpected problems 
will be reported to the DSMB.  
Any s ubject who wishes to withdraw from this investigation on his/her own accord and 
for whatever reason is entitled to do so without obligation and prejudice to further treatment. In 
addition, the Investigator may decide for reasons of medical prudence, to wit hdraw a subject. In 
either event, the Investigator will clearly document the date and reason(s) for the subject’s 
withdrawal from this investigation in the CRF and should indicate whether or not he considers it 
was related to the study interventions.

Investigational product , dosage and mode of administration
Subjects will receive blinded anifro lumab (MEDI -546) [ADDRESS_265823] anned in this study ;point estimates and confidence intervals will 
be presented for each treatment group separately . The sample size is not b ased on statist ical 
considerations, but is defined as all subjects who completed the treatment period in the 
Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_20533] D3461C00004 or D3461C00005 (through Week 52) and met all study  
eligibilit y criteria. Assuming annual dropout rates of 30% (Randomised Placebo), 30% 
(Rando mized Anifro lumab150 m g) and 20% (Randomized Anifrolumab 300mg) , and that 
90% of the subjects completing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_221320]-term extensi on, follow-
up times of approximately 893, 517, and 1343 patient -years for the “Rando mised Anifro lumab 
300 m g,” “ Rando mised Placebo,” and “All Anifro lumab” treatment groups are expected. 
Given this exposure, the 95% CIs for an adverse event of special interest for which the 
observed incidence rate is [ADDRESS_265824] -years will be 5.21 to 19.21 for 
“Rando mised Anifro lumab 300 m g,” and 4.24 to 23.57 for “ Rando mised Placebo.” For an 
adverse event of special interest for which the observed incidence rate is [ADDRESS_265825] -years, the 95% confidence interv al will be 0.18 to 5.42 for “All Anifrolumab” (0.13 to 
7.95 for “Randomised Anifro lumab 300 m g”), and 0.07 to 15.25 for “ Rando mised Placebo,” 
using the Rothm an-Greenland Method.
All subjects enro lled in Studies D3461C00004 or D3461C00005 will be included i n the main 
analysis of the long- term extensi onstudy , even if they do not enter the long -term extensio n
study .  Therefore, the full analysis set will consist of all subjects who were randomised and 
received at least [ADDRESS_265826] ics and qualitat ive

221. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Systemic lupus ery thematosus (SLE) i s a chronic, mult isystemic, disabling autoimmune 
rheumat ic disease of unknown aet iology. Clinical manifestations of SLE include, but are not 
limited to, constitutional symptoms, alopecia, rashes, serosit is, arthrit is, nephrit is, vasculit is, 
lymphadenopathy , splenom egaly , haem olytic anaemia, cognit ive dysfunct ion and other 
nervous system invo lvement. Systemic lupus ery thematosus predominant ly affects women o f 
childbearing years ( Cooper et al, 1998; Lahita, 1999 ) with a review reporting the 
female -to-male rati o in the childbearing y ears to be about 12:1 ( Ramsey-Goldman and Manzi, 
2000). There is a substantial unmet medical need in the treatment of SLE, particularly in 
subjects wi th moderate or severe disease. Alt hough off -label  therapy  has improved 
management options in recent y ears, l ong-term prognosis rem ains poor for m any subjects. 
Com pared to the general populat ion, the overall mortalit y in SLE i s increased wit h a 
standardised mortalit y ratio (defined as the ratio of the number of deaths observed to deaths 
expected) of 2.4, (2.3 to 2.5 95% confidence inter val [CI]) in a l arge internat ional cohort of 
9,[ADDRESS_265842] -years 
(Bernatsky  et al , 2006 ).
All o f the therapi [INVESTIGATOR_221323] s 
and there is a medical need to identify new targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly agents that may 
reduce the requirement for corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents.
Multiple lines of evidence indicate a role of t ype I interferons (IFNs) in the pathogenesis of 
SLE (Hylton et al , 1986 ; Bengtsson et al, 2000; Baechler et al, 2003 ; Bennett et al, 2003 ; 
Crow and Wohlgemuth, 2003 ; Kirou et al, 2004; Okam oto et al , 2004 ; Dall’era et al, 2005; 
Kirou et al, 2005
; Feng et al, 2006 ; Criswell, 2008 ; Huang et al, 2008 ; Sigurdsson, Göring et 
al, 2008 ; Sigurdsson, Nordm ark et al , 2008 ; Yao et al , 2010 ).
With the growing evidence that ty pe I IFNs pl ay an importan t role in autoimmune diseases 
such as SLE, inhibit ion of the bio logical  activi ty of ty pe I IFNs wi th anifro lumab may  
represent a novel, effect ive therapy for the treatment of SLE and its significant unmet medical 
need.
Anifro lumab (MEDI -546) i s a human imm unogl obulin (Ig) G1 kappa monoclonal ant ibody  
(mAb) di rected against subunit 1 of the ty pe I interferon receptor (IFNAR1).  It is composed 
of [ADDRESS_265843] acebo -control led, 
long-term extensio n (LTE) study  to characterise the long -term safet y and tol erabilit y of an 
intravenous (IV) treatment regimen of anifro lumab (300 m g) versus placebo in adult subjects

23who com pleted a Phase 3 study  (D3461C00004 or D3461C00005) through the 52-week 
doubl e-blind treatment period.  
The LTE will allow subjects to continue wit h treatment for an extended period of up to 3 
years. Subjects who received anifro lumab (150 or 300 mg) in the Phase 3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_221324] (300 m g) and subjects who received placebo in the Phase 3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_221325] (300 mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The 
expected ratio of subjects receiving anifro lumab (300 mg) vs placebo in the LTE study  will 
be approximately 4:1. Subjects randomised to placebo in the LTE study  serve as com parators 
to support interpretabilit y of the data collected for subjects randomised to anifrolumab. 
Subjects who were receiving anifro lumab 150 m g in the Phase 3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_221326]
300 m g in the LTE to provi de long-term safet y data on the higher study  dose. Thi s study  
allows for the addit ion of new oral immunosuppressants or changing doses of background 
immunosuppressants, as well as for flexible oral corticosteroids (OCS) use in or der for 
subjects to achieve adequate control of their disease throughout the study . 
Although the study  will initially be com pletely  double -blind, (ie, blind for subjects, 
Invest igators/site staff, and Sponsor/designated clinical research organisat ion [CRO ]), at the 
concl usion of the Phase [ADDRESS_265845] subjects will beco me known to some Sponsor staff and/or designated CRO. The blind 
will be maintained for the Invest igator ,invest igational site staff, and for the subjects.
A treatment period of [ADDRESS_265846]’s long -term safet y profile.
The primary  outcom e measure is the assessment of adverse events of special interest (AESIs), 
and ser ious adverse events (SAEs) to characterise safet y profile.
The select ion of a dose of 300 mg anifro lumab every  4 weeks (Q4W) is based on safet y and 
efficacy  resul ts from the analysis o f a Phase 2b study  where 2 doses of anifrolumab (300 mg 
and 1000 mg) wer e evaluated relat ive to placebo, as well as dose -response modelling and 
simulat ion that were performed.
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
A detailed assessment of the data supporting the overall risk/benefit of anifro lumab is 
discussed in the Invest igato r’s Brochure (IB).
There i s a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects with chronic, 
moderately  to severely act ive SLE. Since type I IFNs have a role in SLE, a therapy that 
targets ty pe I IFN receptors, such as anifro lumab, may be bene ficial in the treatment of these 
subjects.
Anifro lumab demo nstrated a clinically relevant benefit in subjects with moderate to severe 
SLE treated with standard of care (SOC).  The efficacy  was supported by  a broad range of 
clinical measures of global (vari ous l evels o f SLE Responder Index responses, Brit ish Isles

activit y (Cutaneous Lupus Ery thematosus Di sease Area and Severit y Index, j oint coun t).  A 
clinically relevant inc rease in the proportion of subjects achieving pre- specified corticosteroid 
reducti on in the 300 m g group was al so observed com pared wi th placebo. 
In thi s study , anifrol umab will  be administered at a fixed IV dose of 300 mg Q4W for 
156weeks ( the last dose of invest igational product will be given at Week 152), equivalent to 
the lower dose in the Phase 2 study  (CD -IA-MEDI -546- 1013).  
Anifro lumab was generally  well  tolerated.  A dose -related increase in the reporting rate of 
herpes zoster reactivat ion with cutaneous presentatio n was observed in pat ients receiving 
anifro lumab co mpared with placebo.  Herpes zoster reactivat ion with cutaneous presentati on 
is an identified risk for anifrolumab.  No other infectious risks have been identified ; however, 
this cont inues to be cl osely m onitored.  A
lthough anifro lumab is a human mAb, pat ients can 
develop anti-drug antibodies (ADAs )that may  neutralize the activit y of the drug or m ay be 
associ ated wi th acute or delayed hypersensit ivity reacti ons, including anaphylaxis.  
Furtherm ore, the administration of any foreign protein may  be associ ated wi th acute allergic 
or hy persensi tivity react ions that may be severe and may  resul t in death.  Pati ents will be 
monitored for the presence of and the clinical manifestations associate d with the f ormation of 
specific antibodies to anifro lumab.
As of [ADDRESS_265848] (DSMB) review ssafet y data on a regular 
basis throughout the study  (see Sect ion6.10.1 ).
[COMPANY_008] considers that the available non -clinical  and clinical data indicate an acceptable 
safet y profile for anifrolumab.  Protocol -defined exclusions are in pl ace to prevent enrolment
of patients wi th infect ion and m alignancy  risks th at might compromise their safet y.  AESIs, 
such as herpes zoster reactivat ion with cutaneous presentation, as well as other herpes zoster -
associ ated adverse events ( AEs), anaphylaxis, opportunist ic infect ions, serious infections, 
influenza, TB (including la tent TB), m alignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events

 Subjects previously treated with anifro lumab 150 mg will switch to blinded 
anifro lumab 300 m g
 Subjects previously rando mised to placebo will be rando mised 1:[ADDRESS_265853] acebo in an approximate ratio of 4:1.

(oral corticosteroids, antimalarials, and immunosuppress ants)
Permi tted SOC m edicat ions for SLE during the LTE study  include OCS (up to 40 mg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent )
, antimalarials, and immunosuppressants 
(methotrexate, mycopheno late mofetil/mycophenolic acid, mizoribine, azathioprine, and 
tacrolimus). 
Invest igators should apply local pract ices for safety  monitoring, eg, by  [CONTACT_221343], 
in case SOC dose is changed, eg, increased, and/or new disease- modifying ant irheumat ic drug 
(DMARD) i s added .
Subjects m ay undergo changes in their background SOC medication for SLE (OCS, 
antimalarials, or immunosuppressants) doses, based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the Invest igator.  On 
treatm ent days, changes in doses will co mmence after all assessments have been comple ted 
and the invest igational product has been administered.  There is no minimum dose 
requi rement for background SOC medicat ions for SLE, and subjects may taper off as 
permitted by  [CONTACT_221344].  Due to vari ability in subject responses to background SOC
medicat ions for SLE and tolerabilit y of taper, Investigators are asked to use their clinical 
judgment with respect to the taper schedule.  If the subject experiences an increase in SLE 
disease act ivity, SOC medicat ions for SLE m ay be adj usted according to the Invest igator’s 
clinical judgment, but may not exceed maximally permitted doses as defined by [CONTACT_221345].

Immunosuppressants
Subjects m ay change fro m the immunosuppressant on which they  entered the LTE study  to 
another permitted immunosuppressant (methotrexate, mycopheno late mofetil/mycopheno lic 
acid, mizoribine, az athioprine, or tacrolimus) at the discret ion of the Invest igator.  Subjects 
who were not taking an immunosuppressant at the time they enter the LTE study may add [ADDRESS_265887] not exceed the fo llowing:

52-week double -blind treatment period and consented, but were not randomised) and those 
rando mised in the study.  
The same subject identifier (E

Version 3.[ADDRESS_265896], will be available to t he Investigator(s) or pharmacists from the IXRS.  Routines for 
this will be described in the IXRS user manual that will be provided to each centre.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment randomisat ion.  The 
Invest igator should promptly document and explain any premature unblinding to the Sponsor, 
without revealing the treatment given to subject.  In general, unblinding should only occur if 
manag ement of the m edical emergency  woul d be different based on the subject having 
received invest igational product.  In the majorit y of cases, the management of a medical 
emergency woul d be the same whether or not investigat ional product was received by  [CONTACT_1560].  If thi s was the case, the investigational product allocat ion shoul d not be unblinded.
[COMPANY_008] or its designee retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected 
and are suspected to be causally related to an investigat ional produc t and that potentially 
requi re expedited reporting to regulatory  authori ties.  Treatm ent codes will not be broken for 
the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluabilit y of the data from  each 
individual subject have been made and documente d.
Subjects who have been unblinded by  [CONTACT_221346] y or desi gnee (and who have 
not been unblinded to the Invest igator or the PRA Medical Monitor) will not, based on the 
unblinding alone, be discontinued from further receipt of invest igational product.
Although the study  will initially be com pletely  double -blind (ie, blind for subjects, 
Invest igators/site staff, and Sponsor/designated CRO), at the conclusion o f the Phase [ADDRESS_265897] subjects will beco me known to 
the Sponsor staff and/or designated CRO. The blind will be maintained for the Investigator ,

of investigational product that were recei ved. 
The end o f the study  (“study  com pletion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol -specified 
visit/assessment for the last subject in the study .
3.9.[ADDRESS_265903] should be encouraged to continue to undergo all study -related 
visits/proc edures for the full treatment period ( Table 2and Table 3) in order to support the 
final analysis for anifro lumab (see Section

investigat ional product will be documented in the source documents and recorded on the CRF.
It is essent ial to collect as much data as possible for all subjects throughout the study  and 
especially  all potent ia
l endpo int events.  Complete withdrawal fro m the study  (ie, wi thdrawal 
of consent) has a direct negative impact on the potent ial validit y of all study  data and should 
be avo ided wherever possible.  If the subject permanent ly discont inues investigational product 
prior to thei r com pletion of the study  and wishes to continue with only selected study  
assessments, prioritised assessments are listed in Section 4.2.[ADDRESS_265904] the reason 
for study  withdrawal  recorded as “Eligibilit y Criteria Not Fulfilled” (ie, subject does not meet

Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Anifrolumab (MEDI 546)
Study Code D3461C00009
Version 3.[ADDRESS_265906] 2017
554.1 Randomisation
Before randomisat ion (Day 1/Visi t1/Week 0), subjects will be assessed to ensure that they  
have signed the ICF and meet eligibilit y criteria.  Once t he subject is rando mised, relevant 
data m ust be captured in the appropriate LTE system.  Events that occur prior to 
rando misat ion in the LTE study  shoul d be reported in Studies D3461C0004 or D3461C00005.  
Subjects who do not sign the ICF and/or who do not meet the eligibilit y criteria must not be 
rando mised into the LTE study.
The Week 52 assessments of the Phase 3 Studies D3461C00004 or D3461C00005 will serve 
as Day  1/Visi t 1/Week 0 assessments of the LTE study; addit ional procedures that are part of 
the LTE study  will also be performed.  If Day 1/Visi t1/Week [ADDRESS_265907] be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  In case th e Day 1/Visit 1/Week 0 occurs > [ADDRESS_265908] ion tests, and serum creat inine, might be required as judged by [CONTACT_221348]/AZ medical mo nitor.  The rati onale for delayed start, date of las t dose of study  drug, and 
subject compliance in the prior study  will be reviewed.  In addit ion, all procedures for 
Day 1/Visi t1/Week [ADDRESS_265909] be com pleted. 
4.1.1 Other considerations for randomisation
[IP_ADDRESS] Oral examination
In several bio logical program s, there have b een seri ous infecti ons and/or death related to 
Ludwig’s angina.  Alt hough this has not been seen in the anifro lumab program, Invest igators 
shoul d check a subject’s oral cavit y and review their dental healt h carefully.  While a dental 
examinat ion is not requi red pri or to randomisat ion in this study, Invest igators are cautioned to 
consider carefully whether subjects have act ive caries or a dental infect ion prior to 
rando misat ion that might impact subject safet y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Mammography
As subjects with SLE have impaired immune response, are treated with immunosuppressants, 
and are at potential risk for malignancy , it is recommended that subjects randomised into the 
LTE study  are com pliant and up to date with local recommendat ions for mamm ography or 
other screening procedu res for breast cancer.
4.2 Treatment period
During the treatment period, visits will be scheduled for each Q4W administration.  
Procedures during the Treatment Period Year 1 will be performed according to the Study  Plan 
detailing the procedures ( Table 2).  Procedures during the Treatment Period Year 2 through 
Year 3 will be performed according to the Treatment Period Study  Plan detailing the 
procedures 
(Table 3).  The subject - reported outcome assessments should be completed by [CONTACT_1560] (unassisted by  [CONTACT_221349], family  members, or friends) pri or to all other evaluat ions and 
prior to the infusion, as disease assessments/clinical evaluat ions may confound the results.

Vital signs (oral  temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]) will be obtained 
at each visit.  Specific informat ion on vital signs surrounding the infusio n is included in 
Secti on 7.2.4 (Subject monitoring/procedures during and after infusio ns).
5.2.3 Physical examination 
A physical examinat ion will be performed at the visits specified in the Study  Plan (Table 2, 
Table 3, and Table 4) and will include an assessment of the fo llowing: general appearance, 
head and neck, breast, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , cardi ovascular, abdo men, muscul oskeletal /extremi ties, 
neuro logical, skin, lymph nodes, and thy roid.  Body  height will  be captured at randomisat ion 
only.  Subjects will be weighed at each study  visit.  Medi cally  significant changes from

(CIN I and II) will be allo wed to enter the study; . If thesubject’s 
gynaecologist has recommended a repeat Pap smear be performed at a specified interval, the 
Pap sm ear shoul d be obtained as recomme nded and the report provided in the source 
docum ent. Since access to a Pap smear may vary  by [CONTACT_1606] , the Sponsor recommends that 
local guidelines are used for obtaining routine fo llow-up Pap smears in females who have 
received immuno modulators or immunosu ppressive treatment.
5.2.5 Assessment of cardiovascular risk
To understand the contribut ion of the chronic inflammatory  response in SLE to dy slipi[INVESTIGATOR_17939] 
(as a potential risk for accelerated subclinical arteriosclerotic cardio vascular disease) and the 
potenti al effects of anifro lumab treatment, both lipid (including low -and high -densit y 
lipoproteins and triglycerides [see Section 5.2.9 ]) and inflammatory  profiles will be obtained 
during the study .  Concomi tant m edicati ons received for cardiovascular indications should be 
collected and recorded.

Digital ECGs will be perform ed at the visit s specified in the Study  Plan ( Table 2and Table 3).  
Digital ECGs will be obtained after the subject ha s been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_134068] [ADDRESS_265914] igator considers it clinically significant.  Abnormal values shall not be 
recorded as AEs unless deemed clinically  significant.
5.2.7 Tuberculosis monitoring
Blood testing for TB wil l be done using the interferon -gamma release assay (IGRA) test (ie, 
QTF -G In-Tube Test).  Evaluat ion of all subjects by  [CONTACT_153265] -G In-Tube Test will be performed 
by [CONTACT_221351] 
(Table 2and Table 3).  Annual 
QFT -G testing is required for all study  subjects.
Com pared to cul ture-confirmed TB, overall, 87.6% of subjects have a posit ive QFT -G 
In-Tube Test result 
(Cellest is, 2005 ).  The false negative rate in this setting appears to be over 
12%.  Further, the performance o f the test i n the setting of immunosuppressant drugs has not 
been evaluated.  Nor has it been evaluated in individuals wit h medical condi tions other than, 
or in addit ion to, l atent TB, or TB disease.  The guide also states that “Medical treatments or 
condi tions that impair immune funct ions can potentially  reduce IFN -γ responses and prevent 
detection of a specific response to the ( secretory  proteins) ESAT -6 and CFP -10 (the test 
stimulators).”
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis results at time of randomisation/Week 52 of the Phase 3 Study

 If the QFT -G test result was negative and there is no known history of recent 
exposure to i ndividuals wit h act ive TB, the subject may be randomised.  
 If the QFT -G test result was newly positive , a chest x -ray must be performed.  If 
the chest x -ray shows no evidence of active TB, and the subject has no symptoms or

retest i s posi tive, the subject must start on prophylaxis wit hin 30 days o f 
rando misat ion, but prior to the second dose (Visit 2/Week 4) in the LTE study .  The 
subject should be referred to a TB specialis t.  If a TB speci alist i s not available, the

 If the QFT -G test was positive but not newly positive , the subject must have been 
diagnosed wi th latent TB and must have documentation confirming complet ion of 
appropriate OR ini tiate treatm ent for latent TB wi thin 30 days of randomisat ion, but 
prior to the second dose (Visit 2/Week 4).
 If the QFT -G test result was newly indeterminate (as confirmed on retest unless 
prior posi tive QFT -G wasdocumented, along with completed treatm ent for latent 
TB) or indeterminate but not newly indeterminate , further QFT -G testing will be 
done according to the Study  Plan (Table 2and Table 3).  
QFT -G testing is perf ormed at l east annually  and in so me cases more often, depending on the 
resul t.  Refer to the Study  Plan (Table 2and
 Table 3).
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis monitoring during the study
At every visit, sites shoul d ensure that the subject has no signs or symptoms of active TB, no 
recent contact [CONTACT_221352] h active TB, and there is no history  of latent (unl ess diagnosed 
with documentati on of  initiation of appropriate treatment) or active T B. 
If during the trial a subject is determined to have a:
 Negative QFT -G test result, only the annual TB testing is required.
 Newly positive QFT -G test result, a chest x -ray has to be performed, and the 
subject should be referred to a TB specialist.  If a TB specialist is not available, the 
local country  guidelines shoul d be f ollowed for further diagnost ic work up and ant i
-
TB treatment regimens.  If no local guidelines exist for immunocompromised 
individuals, then [LOCATION_003] guidelines may be fo llowed.  Thi s shou ld be reported as an 
AESI.  The QFT -G test must be repeated annually.
 Forindeterminate QFT -G test result, refer to Sectio n5.2.7.[ADDRESS_265916] annually and in so me cases more often, dep ending on the 
resul t.  Refer to the Study  Plan (Table 2and Table 3).
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis monitoring at Week 156

5.2.8 Modified Flare Index
A modified SELENA flare index, using the S LEDAI -2K instead of the SELENA SLEDAI, 
will be co mpleted at the times indicated in the Study  Plan (Table 2and Table 3) to 
characterise flares as safet y events .
The m odified flare assessment should be completed by  [CONTACT_221353]/qualified 
physician as per protocol schedule o f assessments.  Assessment of flare should be scored in 
comparison to the subject’s pre vious visit (ie, over the past 28 days) and should only include 
findings that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the Investigator, are due to SLE disease act ivity within that 
timeframe.  Flare will be defined as any 1 criterion present in eit her the Mild/Moderate Flare 
orSevere Flare categories.  New or worsened manifestations should only be reported for 
manifestations of SLE.
5.2.9 Clinical laboratory tests
All clinical laboratory
 tests will be performed in a central clinical laboratory  at the times 
indicated in the Study  Plan (Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4). 
Urine pregnancy  tests will be performed at the site using a dipst ick.  A serum FSH will be 
performed at randomisation at the central laboratory  in newly postm enopausal  females wi th 
menses absent for ≥1year.
Abnorm al safety  laboratory  resul ts shoul d be repeated as clinically  indicated, as soon as 
possible (preferably wit hin 24 to 48 hours).  Addit ional safet y samples may be collected if 
clinically indicated at the discret ion of the Invest igator. 
Every  attem pt shoul d be made to redraw any  missing safet y laboratory  test sam ples, even if 
the subject has received the investigational product.
The Investi gator shoul d make an assessment of the available results with regard to clinically 
relevant abnorm alities.  The l aboratory  resul ts shoul d be si gned and dated and retained at the 
site as source data for l aboratory  variables.  For inform ation on how AEs base d on laboratory  
tests shoul d be recorded and reported, see Section

resul ts.
An AESI that meets 1 of the seriousness outcomes listed in Section 6.2will be categorised as 
an SAE for the purposes of fo llow-up responsibilit y and safet y reporti ng.  A nonserious AES I 
will be categorised as an AE.  For reporting of AESIs, see Section 6.8.
6.5.1 Medically significant infections (including viral 
infection/reactivation/opportunistic infections)
Medically  significant infections are a n important potential risk based on the mechanism o f 
action of  anifrolumab.  For safet y reporting purposes, in this study , infect ions are classified as 
either seri ous non -opportunist ic infect ions or opportunist ic infect ions as described here.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious non -opportunistic infection
A serious non -opportuni stic infection is any non -opportunist ic infect ion that m eets the SAE 
criteria in Section
 6.2.  Seri ous non -opportunist ic infect ion AEs are reported as SAEs and 
AESIs .  It i s expected that cul ture resul ts and all diagnostic or therapeutic procedure results 
perform ed on a subject experiencing a serious non -opportunist ic infect ion will be provided as 
an SAE update.  Nonserious non -opportuni stic infections will not be cap tured as AESIs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Opportunistic infection
An opportunist ic infect ion is an invasive infection caused by [CONTACT_221354] -pathogenic or rarely pathogenic in individuals wit h norm al immune funct ion or 
cause an infect ion of a ty pe or severi ty not seen in the normal host. 
Examples of opportunistic infect ions that may occur in SLE subjects include: herpes zoster
meningoencephalit is, Salmonella bacteraemia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneum onia, or 
progressive mult ifocal leukoencephalopathy . It is expected that culture results and all 
diagnosti c or therapeuti c procedure results performed on a subject experiencing a serious 
opportunist ic infect ion will be provided as an SAE update. Since anifro lumab is an 
immuno modulatory  agent and the Sponsor needs t o understand the safet y profile of this 
investigat ional product, i ncluding assessment of how anifro lumab may affect resistance to 
different ty pes of  infecti ons, Invest igators are asked to undertake appropriate microbio logic 
ident ificat ion including culture , and report culture results for all subjects who develop serious 
infect ions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Influenza
Influenza is a severe viral infect ion that includes the fo llowing symptom s: tem perature greater 
than 100.8°F (38.2°C), and malaise, headache, or myalgia. It is often a ccompanied by [CONTACT_33234], 
vomiting, and diarrhoea, and at least 1 of the fo llowing respi[INVESTIGATOR_29197] s: cough, sore 
throat, or shortness of breath.
Laboratory  criteria for influenza include at least 1 of the following: isolat ion of influenza virus 
from a clin ical specimen, detecti on of  influenza virus nucleic acid in a clinical specimen,

If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the Investigator, the subject has had influenza (the specific viral

has been performed. Less severe viral infection should be repo rted as an AE only .

resul ts and pertinent bio marker and/or genetic testing results performed, and to report these 
for any  malignancies reported during the study .
6.5.4 Herpes zoster reacti vations (including cutaneous events)
Herpes zoster is a viral infect ion characteri sed by  a cutaneous vesicular eruption on an 
erythematous base presenting alo ng dermatome(s) and usually associated with prodromal 
pain.  Herpes zoster resul ts from the reacti vation of varicella zoster virus; mult iple 
derm atom es may  be involved (>3 indicates disseminated disease) and organ or sy stemic 
infect ion may occur (invasive; therefore an opportunist ic infection).  Polymerase chain 
reacti on testing of samples fro m vesicle s, biopsy, or other specimens (eg, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]) 
may confirm the presence of varicella zoster virus.   
Herpes Zoster reactivat ion with cutaneous 
presentation is an ident ified risk.
. Systemic infect ions or other medically significant herpes zoster i nfect ions are considered 
important potential risks and classified as medically significant infections for adverse event 
reporting in this study unexpected for regulatory  reporti ng purposes . For addit ional 
inform ation regarding herpes zoster , refer to the IB. As all herpes zoster events are 
considered to be an AESI, the Sponsor will co llect informat ion including whether or n ot

(IGRA ), radi ographic imaging, bo dy fluid and tissue sampling; presentation may include 
disseminated or l atent disease.  An infection may  be new (at l east conversio n of a TB test to 
positive) or reactivat ion of dormant disease (new active disease in a previously TB test 
positive subject w ithout pri or evi dence o f active disease).
 A bacteriologically confirmed TB case is a case where a bio logical specimen is 
positive by [CONTACT_153273] , culture or rapi d diagnosti c, such as polymerase chain 
reacti on or nucl eic acid am plificat ion test (Xpert MTB/RIF).
 A clinically diagnosed TB case is a case where the subject does not fulfil the 
criteria for bacterio logical confirmati on, but has been diagnosed with active TB by  
a clinician or other medical pract itioner who has decided to give the subject a ful l 
course of TB treatment.  This definit ion includes cases diagnosed on the basis of 
x-ray abnorm alities or suggestive histology  and extra -pulmo nary cases wi thout 
laboratory  confi rmation.  Clinically  diagnosed cases subsequent ly found to be 
bacteri ologically positive (before or after starting treatment) should be reclassified 
as bacterio logically confirmed.
Bacterio logically confirmed or clinically  diagnosed cases of TB are also classified according 
to: anatomical site of disease; history  of previ ous treatm ent; drug resi stance; HIV status 
(World Heal th Organizat ion, 2014). 
Latent TB is a mycobacterial infect ion without clinical, bacterio logical findings, or radio logic

syndro mes, wherever possible.  
6.5.7 Major adverse cardiovascular events
As a m easure of enhanced pharmacovigilance, an independent Cardiova scular Event 
Adjudicat ion Co mmittee (CV -EAC) will review deaths (due to any  cause) and all SAEs in the 
cardi ovascular Sy stem  Organ Classes for evaluat ion as to whether to classify  as MACE events 
(stroke, my ocardial  infarct ion, or cardiovascular death).
TheCV-EAC will review cases of interest to determine if they  meet accepted di agnostic 
criteria.  Causalit y assessments will not be made by  [CONTACT_153277] -EAC, nor will the committee 
possess governance authorit y.  The CV -EAC will be blinded regarding any informat ion 
relating to the randomisat ion group.
6.6 Recording of adverse events
6.6.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
Adverse events and SAEs will be collected from the time of rando misat ion, throughout the 
treatm ent peri od, and including the fo llow-up period unti l Follow-up Visi t 2 ([ADDRESS_265935]-final dose).  Events that occur prior to randomisation in the LTE study should be reported 
in Studi es D3461C0004 or D3461C00005.  
6.6.[ADDRESS_265936]’s last v isit in the study are fo llowed up by  [CONTACT_221357] l ong as medically  indicated.  The Sponsor retains the right to request 
additional information for any  subject wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if 
judged necessary .
6.6.3 Variables 
Thefollowing variables will be collected for each AE;
 AE (verbat im)
 The date and time when the AE started and stopped
 Maximum intensit y
 Whether the AE is serious or not
 Invest igator causalit y rating against the invest igational product (yes or no)
 Action take n with regard to invest igational product
 Outcom e of AE

Version 3.[ADDRESS_265937] 2017
76In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
 Onset Date (Date AE met criteria for serious AE)
 Detection Date (Date Invest igator became aware of serious AE)
 AE is seri ous due to:
(a) Death
-Date of death
-Autopsy  performed
-Primary/secondary  cause of death
(b) Life-threatening
(c) In-patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_103421]
Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913]
Date of discharge
(d) Congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
(e) Important medical event
(f) Suspected transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infectious agent
 Descript ion of AE
 Invest igator causalit y assessment to concomitant medicat ions
 Invest igator causalit y assessment to study  procedures (yes or no)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_72991] a defined above.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours m ay be consi dered severe nausea, but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke 
that resul ts in only  a limi ted degree of di sabili ty may  be considered a mild stroke but would be 
an SAE.  The Invest igator should provide an assessment of the severit y of each AE/SAE.
6.6.[ADDRESS_265938] and each AE, 
andanswer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there is a reasonable possibilit y 
that the event may have been cau sed by  [CONTACT_33159]?’

of an SAE.  All AESIs (serious or nonserious) will be recorded on the AE CRF (using a 
recogni sed m edical term  or di agnosis that accurately  reflects the event).
The reporti ng period for AESIs is the period immediately fo llowing rando misation through 
the end of subject participat ion in the study .  Adverse events of special interest that occur prior 
to randomisation in the LTE study  shoul d be reported i n Studi es D3461C0004 or

resul ts shoul d be reported wi th the event.  Other specifi c laboratory  tests or other 
investigat ions (eg, chest x -ray for pneum onia) that confirm or aid in the diagnosis or treatment 
shoul d be obtained when indicated, and results should be reported with the SAE or AESI.  
Failure to obtain this informat ion will im pair the Sponsor’s abilit y to characterise the

investigat ional product should be interrupted until the Invest igator confirms the symptoms and 
signs of  infect ion have reso lved or that no active infect ion has developed.
If dosi ng is resumed after resolution of a safet y concern (i e, infect ion or other AE) the 
investigat ional product must be administered within 14 days after the scheduled time of the 
missed dose.  If this is not possible, dosing should be resumed at the time of th e next 
scheduled dose.

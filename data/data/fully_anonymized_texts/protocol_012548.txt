 Background and Rationale  
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is the most common type of neurofibromatosis with a broad 
spectrum of clinical manifestations in multiple organs of the body, including benign and 
malignant tumors (1 –3). This autosomal dominant disease arises from several thousand  
genetic variants in the chromosome 17, but about 50% of the muta tions are de novo (25) . 
Moreover, mitochondrial DNA mutations in the loop region of the genome were seen in 37% of 
cutaneous neurofibromas and in 50% of plexiform neurofibromas, as also in non- tumor cell s like 
non-affected skin cells (28). Although it is unclear if those mitochondrial mutations have 
functional effects, o ther evidence implicates that the impairment of neurofibromin causes 
mitochondrial dysfunction (MD).  
The relation between neurofibromin and mitochondria is structural and functional. Neurofibromin can be co -localized within and extracted from mitochondria (26). Losing neurofibromin, 
guanosine- 5'-triphosphate ( GTP) hydrolysis decreases, activating RAS, a protein complex that 
stimulates mitochondrial degradation (27) . Neurofibromin might also modulate mitochondrial 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Animal models showed mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_625183] (ATP) generation that was reverted with transgene expression of neurofibromin (9) . Loss of 
neurofibromin also activates extracellular signal -regulated- 1/2 (ERK 1/2), affecting i ts interaction 
with mitochondrial chaperone tumor necrosis factor receptor associated protein 1 (TRAP1), 
decreasing succinate coenzyme Q reductase (10,27) . Although NF1 animal models show 
mitochondrial dysfunction, literature evaluating mitochondrial function in patients with NF1 is 
scarce. Another factor possibly impacting mitochondrial function is the use of MEK inhibitors. 
These drugs are the only FDA -approved treatment for plexiform neurofibroma, a type of tumor 
that grows in the nerves of NF1 patients. MEK inhibitors can cause an increase in the oxygen 
consumption rate, and they can alter the mitochondrial metabolism affecting complex I and the 
electron transport chain (24,29) . We hypothesize that NF1 patients exhibit a range of MD 
that contributes to adverse health outcomes . Validation of this hypothesis will establish a 
bioenergetic phenotype among NF1 patients to better stratify them than current clinical 
descriptions. This information will then be used for identifying relationships between patient 
symptoms and mitochondrial function to demonstrate its value in the clinic (Aim 1). Further, 
patient mitochondrial function will serve as an important mechanistic readout on the 
consequences of neurofibromi n mutations and impacts of other factors including lifestyle, diet, 
and drugs (like MEK inhibitors) that can improve or harm mitochondrial function (Aim 2). These 
findings would expand beyond the current limitations of results from model neurofibromin 
knoc kout studies to more relevant complexities observed with patients. Taken together, 
information gained from patient mitochondrial function assessments would create opportunities 
to develop more personalized, targeted therapeutic interventions for improving patient 
outcomes.  
The mitochondrial function in patients with  NF1 and how it correlates with clinical symptoms will 
be investigated  for the first time in this proposed study. This novel experimental design will 
generate more clinically relevant findings in  humans than current in vitro and in vivo animal 
studies. Moreover, the strategy leverages a minimally invasive blood test using peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to assess mitochondrial function. Studies with PBMCs detected metabolic stress in pa tients and acted as biomarkers for MD in diseases including diabetes (22) , 
neurodegenerative disea se (23), cardiovascular disease (21) , as well as many cancers (14–16). 
The proposed study will be the first demonstration of PBMCs as biomarkers for MD for NF1 
patients. This new technique will expand the phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_625184] f or patients to include

 bioenergetic demands due to the disease as well as in response to interventions like the 
growing field of MEK inhibitors for NF1 treatment (1,4,24) . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]’s candidate 
biomarker approach on mitochondrial function focuses on clinically relevant questions such as 
fatigue, pain, cardiac , and renal function. However, our results could be correlated with other 
important NF1 phenotypes and even data from future systemic unbiased multi -omics 
approaches to interpret their meaning within patient bioenergetics.    
 
Hypothesis and/or  Specific Aims or Objectives 
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is one of the most common hereditary tumor predisposition 
syndrome s afflicting ~1 in 2750 people worldwide (1,2) . Hallmark traits include peripheral and 
central nervous system tumors along with skin and eye lesions, cognitive deficiencies, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and multiple types of cancer (2,3). The clinical phenotype arises 
from point mutations (90%) and deletions of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene encoding neurofibromin (4). A well- characterized neurofibromin function is stimulation of Ras GTPase 
activity leading to Ras inactivation and suppression of its signals through multiple effectors, 
including mTOR, MEK, ERK, and potentially cAMP /PKA indirectly (5–7). Emerging evidence 
suggests that neurofibromin regulates cellular and organismal metabolism. The decreased 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_625185] (ratio of eliminated CO
2 to consumed O 2) reported for NF1 patients  
implicate neurofibromin defects as a source of altered basal metabolic rates (8) . Similarly, 
animal knockout models have reduced respi [INVESTIGATOR_625186] 
(9–11).  Further analysis of isolated cells lacking neurofibromin show lower basal and coupled 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], lowered maximal and spare respi[INVESTIGATOR_625187], and elevated reactive oxygen 
species, underscoring the importance of neurofibromin on mitochondrial function (10) . 
Supplementation with L- carnitine, a mitochondrial nutrient important for fatty acid oxidation and 
gluconeogenesis, improved weakness and fatigue in NF1 patients (12,13) . Due to a diverse 
array of genetic lesions, we hypothesize that NF1 patients exhibit a range of mitochondrial 
dysfunction (MD) as contributing fact ors to adverse health outcomes . We will test the 
hypothesis by [CONTACT_625199] (PBMCs) from NF1 patients 
recruited through the new Adult UAMS Neurofibromatosis Clinic at the Winthrop P. Rockefeller 
Cancer Institute and measure mitochondrial function for correlative studies with clinical 
phenotypes and symptoms. While novel for NF1 pat ient studies, the use of PBMCs for 
mitochondrial studies has precedence in assessing function with a variety of cancers and other 
diseases (14–23). The effort for this NF1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_625188]1 ([CONTACT_625210] -Horta), mitochondrial biology ([CONTACT_625211]- Burns), and 
metabolism ([CONTACT_351094] P . Miller) to achieve the following aims:  
 
Aim 1:  Demonstrate mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_625189]1 patients .  
We will use a n Agilent  Seahorse XF Pro A nalyzer to measure the cellular and mitochondrial 
bioenergetics of PBMC isolated from NF1 patients. We predict patients with milder symptoms of 
fatigue, pain, liver and cardiac function, creatine kinase (CK) , and body mass index (BMI) will 
demonstrate better mitochondrial function in their circulating cells.

 Aim 2:  Assess whether therapeutic interventions impact mitochondrial function and 
metabolic plasticity of circulating cells of NF1 patients .  
We hypo thesize that MD among NF1 patients sensitizes them to therapeutic interventions 
targeting mitochondria. We will assess the impact of vitamin D treatment to potentially improve 
mitochondrial function and explore if MEK inhibitors like Koselugo (KOS, Selumet inib, FDA -
approved treatment of plexiform neurofibromas in NF1) harm mitochondrial function in patients with NF1, due to their impact in the RAS pathway (24) . We predict that the impact of treatments 
on mitochondrial function will lead to insights on mechanisms of action for NF1 patients and possibly serve as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers for patient outcomes.   
Preliminary findings  will demonstrate a powerful, novel approach for assessing and 
understanding the differences in bioenergetic status among N F1 patients and open new 
research venues. The next steps will study the degree of MD and its correlation with 1) different 
NF1 mutations (deletions, truncations), 2) other NF1 complications like cognition outcome and 
quality of life , and  3) prevalence and prognosis of cancers.  
Hence, this proposal will generate future projects that will aid the team in achiev ing the long-
term goal of determining mechanisms driving NF1 clinical phenotypes and symptoms to stratify 
and treat patients. To that end, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] s tudy will foster a collaborative team across disciplines 
and departments at UAMS to leverage the first and only neurofibromatosis clinic in Arkansas at UAMS for improving adult NF1 patient care, a nd also expand the spectrum of research done by 
[CONTACT_604026]. Miller and Aykin -Burns, who have not researched populations with genetic diseases so 
far, and [CONTACT_625212], who has not researched  mitochondrial function.  
 
Study Design  and Procedures (sometimes called “Methods”)  
Although all NF1 patients have genetic changes in the same gene, the clinical presentations of 
the disease are widely diverse. Thus, it is important to determine non -invasive biomarkers that 
would help stratifying NF1 patients, who present with highly vari able and unpredictable clinical 
manifestations. Some of the comorbidities seen in NF1 are also shared with patients with mitochondrial diseases (e.g., short stature, fatigue, pain). Thus, our main goal will be to 
demonstrate a co- association of clinical sy mptoms and MD that exists in these patients.   
 
Aim 1:  Demonstrate that mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_625190]1 patients.   
Parameters associated with MD of PBMCs will be assessed as potentially shared cellular 
pathology in NF1 patients. We hypothesize that MD based on parameters (e.g. , coupling 
efficiency  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_14008]) positively correlates with more adverse outcom es as 
reflected in the symptoms of fatigue, pain, liver, kidney, and cardiac function.  Patients over [ADDRESS_832958] will be 
registered in the study only after obtaining a signed copy of the Informed Consent Form, 
completing all pretreatment evaluations, meeting all eligibility criteria, and presenting no 
exclusion criteria. The neurofibromatosis clinic at UAMS currently cares for  100 patients a year , 
and it is in a phase of expansion. It is expected that the clinic will see  100 to 140  patients in the 
next year. We will also recruit 10  to 15  healthy individuals as the control group. Mitochondrial 
function and cellular bioenergetics will be measured in PBMCs and platelets isolated from blood 
collected at consent and every 3 -4 months for one year. Freshly isolated cel ls will be plated in 
coated XF96 -Pro well plates using assay media , and the plate will be centrifuged. After the

 attachment is confirmed, the cells will be then incubated in a non- CO2 incubator for 20 min at 
37°C. The cellular bioenergetics of PBMCs or pla telets will be determined by [CONTACT_2329] a standard 
mitochondrial stress test as we previously published via consecutively injecting oligomycin, an 
uncoupler (FCCP), and the mitochondrial electron transport chain blockers antimycin A and 
rotenone into the wells as we previously published (30– 37). Clinical repercussions of MD in NF1 
will be measured through serial scor es of fatigue and pain on the same days that PBMC and 
platelets are collected. Fatigue will be assessed through the Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy -Fatigue (FACIT- F). FACIT -F is the only fatigue scale that has been validated in 
dermatologi cal and painful disease, as it is commonly used in neurological disorders  (38). Pain 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_257141] -11 scale, as recommended by [CONTACT_941] p atient -reported outcome group 
of the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REIS) (39). Other 
biochemical and metabolic functions to be followed will be CK, cardiac function through 
echocardiogram, body mass index, liver , and kidney function.   
 
Aim 2: Assess whether therapeutic interventions impact mitochondrial function and 
metabolic plasticity of circulating cells of NF1 patients . We hypothesize that NF1 patients’ 
inherent mitochondrial dysfunction makes them more responsive to therapeutic interventions 
resulting in further mitochondrial injury (e.g. , by [CONTACT_625200], including KOS) or improved 
function (e.g. , by [CONTACT_1996] D). Most patients are vitamin D deficient so the standard of care 
involves supplementation that could improve mitochondrial function given its essential role in 
many related processes. Also, we will carry out an exploratory study on the potential adverse effects of KOS on adult NF1 patients who are beginning therapy during the study window. While 
promising in treatment, the use of thi s drug has a high incidence of significant adverse side 
effects like cardiotoxicity (30%). The cause for toxicity is unknown yet may involve further compromised mitochondrial function as reported for other similar tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (40). 
The combination of these studies will provide a critical preliminary assessment of the sensitivity 
of the mitochondrial measures to patient interventions as well as the poss ible capacity to 
correlate with favorable or harmful outcomes.

or control group will be provided a copy of the consent for review. A thorough discussion of the

Specimen Handling and Storage   
Blood samples will be collected from patient s and controls during routine appointment s. 
Samples will be given a unique identifying number, and then transported to [CONTACT_625213] -

done by [CONTACT_625202] .  
 If the patient sample volume is not completely used for this project, it will be re tained for further 
study if patient indicates so in the consent. This sample might be used for future research to 
study the pathophysiology of neurofibromatosis. In the case that there is an opportunity to use 
the storage blood, we will decode data and ent er in contact [CONTACT_625203].  
 
Data Analysis  
XF Pro mito -stress test data will provide direct measurements of basal, nonmitochondrial, 
and maximum respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and we will use th ese data to calculate the mitochondrial basal 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], ATP -linked respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], reserve respi[INVESTIGATOR_14008], proton leakage, and coupling 
efficiency in PBMCs and platelets isolated from the control group once and from NF1 patients 
longitudinally (3 times). At the end of each run, we wi ll also determine the cellular bioenergetics 
and metabolic plasticity (switch between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis) of the cells 
via plotting extracellular acidification rate versus oxygen consumption rate. The NF1 and healthy 
control groups' m itochondrial function and metabolic plasticity parameters will be compared in 
addition to longitudinal changes in these parameters for each NF1 patient. Linear regression analysis will be utilized to establish the relationship between coupling efficiency, respi[INVESTIGATOR_13999] ( ATP- linked, reserve capacity etc.) as well as metabolic plasticity and NF1 clinical 
phenotype and biochemical scores for fatigue, pain, CK, cardiac function, BMI, and liver function. Analysis of variance for repeated measures will als o be used to analyze changes in 
these parameters over time by [CONTACT_625204] (NF1 patients before and after Vitamin D and/or KOS administration).

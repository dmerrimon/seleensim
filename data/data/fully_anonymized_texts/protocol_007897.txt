Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
TITLE:  Phase II trial of vosaroxin in combination with infusional cytarabine in 
patients with untreated AML  
OBJECTIVES:               
Primary Objective:    
• To assess the rate of complete remission (CR) after induction  therapy with the 
combination of “7+V” [vosaroxin and standard dose infusional cytosine  
arabinoside (ara -C)] for patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute 
myelogenous leukemia (AML)  
 Secondary Objectives:  
• To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of “7+V”  
• To evaluate for the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) remaining after 
“7+V” induction and/or re-induction 
• To determine the CR/CRi rate after one or 2 cycles of “7+V” induction  
• To d etermine the time to  neutrophil and platelet recovery following “7+V” 
induction 
• To a ssess d isease -free survival (DFS) at 1yr of patients achieving CR/CRi after 
“7+V” induction  
• To a ssess o verall survival (OS) at 1yr of all patients receiving protocol- defined 
therapy  
• To d etermine the correlation of HSCT  comorbidity index , AML -Score,  and 
Wheatley Index scores with disease response, DFS and OS  
 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• To describe the mutational burden of this cohort of AML patients 
• To correlate genomic aberration with response rate, DFS, and OS 
• To determine the number of patients treated with vosaroxin who eventually go to 
allogeneic HSCT

CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  STUDY DESIGN:   
• Single -arm, open -label, phase II study of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in 
patients with newly diagnosed AML.   
• Vosaroxin will be administered intravenously at 90 mg/m2 on days [ADDRESS_19729] fashion as a continuous infusion of 100 mg/m2 daily on 
days 1 -7.  
 Patients with evidence of residual leukemia on “Day 14 biopsy” following initial induction will be offered re -induction with intravenous vosaroxin at 70 mg/m2 on 
days 1 and 4 in combination with continuous infusion cytarabine at 100 mg/m2 daily on days 1-7. 
• Two-stage design.  Forty -one (41) patients will provide 80% power to detect a 20% 
increase in complete remission rates (from 40% to 60%) with a Type I Error rate of 5%. The design permits one interim look to examine evidence of futility after the first 17 patients are evaluable for response.  If ≤ 7 patients achieve CR then the likelihood of reaching the goal endpoint of ≥ 60% remission would be diminished.  In this case, the VITAL Study DSMB (consisting  of a representative from the funding organization, the 
study chairs, a biostatistician, and participating investigator to be selected by [CONTACT_20976] ) will review the clinical data to determine the merits of continued enrollment.  If > 
7 CRs are obser ved then the second stage will open automatically  and increase 
enrollment to 41 patients. 
 Stage 1: First 17 patients who are evaluable for response prior to futility analysis 
 Stage 2: Patients 18 -41 enrolled after futility analysis    
• Likelihood- based asses sment of the statistical evidence be used to monitor the false 
discovery rate as data accrue and will provide the option of adding one or two extension cohorts of 10 participants each if the initial trial results are inconclusive.  
• Selected Standard of Care Study Procedures:  Pre-enrollment marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] / biopsy to confirm AML diagnosis in accordance 
with WHO define diagnostic criteria , and to be used for analys es as outlined 
below in correlative analyses section  
 Echo / MUGA to assess LVEF prior to exposure to induction chemotherapy 
 Repeat marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] / biopsy at day 14 ( ± 2 days) following initiation of 
induction therapy to assess disease status 
 Recovery marrow assessment to be performed following count recovery (ANC > 1000, Pl atelets > 100) fol lowing the initiation of induction therapy for formal 
response assessment.  Disease assessment will be performed on day 57 (± 3 days) 
for those failing to demonstrate peripheral count recovery, or per the discretion of the investigator .

STATISTICAL  PLAN : 
The primary objective of this single -arm, phase II clinical trial is to determine if 
vosaroxin in combination with standard dose cytarabine as induction chemotherapy can significantly improve the rate of complete remission (CR) in patients with untreated a cute 
myeloid leukemia.  Forty -one (41) patients will be enrolled in a two -stage design that permits 
one interim look to examine evidence of futility. As per convention, the study will not be stopped early on the basis of preliminary evidence of efficacy observed at the end of the first stage (i.e., at the interim look).   
    Ethical imperatives and resource constraints encourage the exploration of more adaptive 
designs. Hence we propose, in the context of a standard two- stage design, that a likelihood- based 
assessment of the statistical evidence be used.  An important advantage is that, unlike p- values , 
which are binary in nature, likelihood ratios have three evidential zones: evidence favoring the null hypothesis, evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis, and weak or inconclusive evidence (i.e., favoring neither hypothesis).  
In accordance with our desire to maintain a uniform study design, we set a total sample 
size of 41 participants.  An interim futility analysis will be conducted following enrollmen t of 17 
evaluable patients.  If ≤ 7 patients achieve CR then the likelihood ratio in support of reaching the goal endpoint of ≥ 60% remission would be diminished.  In this case, the DSMB will review the clinical data to determine the merits of continued en rollment.   If > [ADDRESS_19730] 17 evaluable patients, enrollment will automatically proceed to enroll a total of 41 patients.  Under this two- stage design, a 60% remission endpoint by [CONTACT_941] “7+V” combination is 3.45 times 
more likely tha n a 40% response rate if 22 or more patients experience CR.  
In the context of the planned likelihood assessment the option will be provided to add an 
extension cohort of up to 20 participants if the initial trial results are inconclusive. In this 
scenario , the use of a likelihood based extension cohort results in false positive and false 
discovery rates of 3.7% and 3.9%, respectively.

CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  1. BACKGROUND  
1.1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia  
Data from the American Cancer Society estimate 18,[ADDRESS_19732] been identified based on 
their genetic features.3-7 Careful examination of disease characteristics at diagnosis is 
imperative to risk -stratify patients and appropriately apply novel risk- adapted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20954] (HSCT).    
  
1.2. Study Rationale 
AML is an aggressive and highly fatal disease with a median age of 67 years at diagnosis 
and an unfortunate age -adjusted 5- year survival of 24.2%.8  Given the advanced age of the 
majority of patients with this diagnosis and/or the medical comorbidities often associated with their advanced age, many AML patients are not offered the conventional intensive 
strategy of “7+3” (cytarabine + anthracycline).  Many older patients who are deemed  
medically appropriate to receive an intensive induction strategy tend to have AML with poor 
risk cytogenetic or molecular features and only ~40% are expected to achieve complete 
remission.
9,10  Because of these features, the 5 -year overall survival of patients above the age 
of 55 approaches only 10%.[ADDRESS_19733] therapy of 7+3.  With the exception of favorable risk AML in younger patients, the 5 year survival for patients less than 55 years of age remains less than 40%.
[ADDRESS_19734] 40 years warrants the investigation of newer agents in the frontline setting.    
As vosaroxin ± cytarabine has been successfully administered and tolerated in both AML 
patients of advanced age (≥ 60 years)11 and all patients with relapsed/refractory disease ,12,13 
14 we will pursue the investigation of the combination of cytarabine with vosaroxin (“7+V”) 
in newly diagnosed AML patients .

1.3. Investigational Product  
Vosaroxin is a first-in-class antican cer quinolon e derivative (A QD) currently in clinica l 
devel opmen t by [CONTACT_20982], Inc. as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemi a 
(AML). The mol ecular formula of vosaroxin is C 18H19N5O4S and its mol ecular weight is 
401.45 Daltons. Vosaroxin is ad ministered as a short intravenous (IV) infusion within [ADDRESS_19736] from other cytotoxic anticancer 
agents. The activity of vosaroxin in ma mmalian cells appears to para llel th e activity of the 
quinolone antibiotics in prokaryotes .15-17 Vosaroxin intercalates DNA and inhibits 
topoisomerase I I activity thro ugh both enzymatic inhibition and po isoning.18  This l eads to 
site-selective DNA double-strand br eaks (DSB) in G/C-rich sequences, which are 
characteristic sites of quinolone-induced DNA  cleavage.19 Vosaroxin targets actively 
replicating cells, and the exten t of DNA dama ge is ce ll-cycle dependent, with th e damage 
induced in G2/M > S >> G1. The DNA dama ge results in a delay in S phase, a rrest at G2/ M 
phase, and cell death by [CONTACT_20983]. Vosaroxin is minima lly metabo lized and does not require 
metabo lism for cytotoxic activity. 
Vosaroxin and cytarabine have non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_20955]
.20  In contras t to vosaroxin, cytarabi ne is a pyr imidi ne nucleoside analog that requires 
cellular uptake and metabo lism to form th e active metabolite, arabinosyl-cy tosine 
triphosphate (ara-CTP). The activities of ara-CTP, namely inhibition of DNA polymerase and 
DNA ligase, and direct incorporation into D NA, result in DNA dama ge and ter mination of 
synthesis
. Cytarabine activity is highly specifi c for th e S phas e of the cell cycle. 
Phase 1 Studies SPO-0001 & SPO-0002: Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors 
The purpose of these studies was to a ss ess th e vosaroxin dose-l imiting toxicity (DL T), 
maximum- tolerated dose (MTD), pharm acokinetics and clinical activity of vosaroxin in 
patient s with relapsed/refr actory so lid tumors. 21   Two dose-escalation studies evaluated I V 
vosaroxin  administered every 3 weeks ( SPO-0001) or weekly every 28 days for 3 weeks 
(SPO-0002). In SPO- 0001, patients were classified as heavil y pretr eated (HP) o r minima lly 
pretr eated (MP) based on therapeutic history. 
In the SPO
-0001 study (N=41; 24 H P/17 MP ), patients were treated in eight dose cohorts 
using 3-75 mg/m2.  At th e 60 mg/m2 dose, four HP patients experien ced DLTs of gra de 4 
neutropenia ( N= 3; one with fever) and grade 3 febr ile neutropenia/pneumonia (N=1). A t the

neutropenia/ thrombocy topenia (N= 1) or grade 2 oral thrush for >29 days (N=1). The MTD 
was established at 48 mg/m2 (HP patients) and 60 mg/m2 (MP patients). 
In th e SPO-0002 study (N=21), patients were treat ed in six dose cohorts using 3-24 
mg/m2. At th e 18 mg/m2 dose, two patients experien ced DLTs of grade 3 neutropenia (one 
with pleural e ffusion, each >14 days). The MTD was established at 15 mg/m2. Vosaroxin 
exhibited low cl earance (2 L/h/m2), a long ter minal half-life (22 hours), and dose- 
proportional exposure. Overall, 31 of 62 patients achieved stable dis ease and one patient 
(ovarian cancer) achieved a partial respons e pe r Rustin criteria. 
Phase 1b SPO-0004 Trial: Relapsed/Refractory Leukemia 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate th e DLT, MTD, pharm acokinetics (PK), 
clinical activity and pharm acod ynamics of vosaroxin in patients with in relapsed/refractory 
leukemia (N=73).  12  Vosaroxin was ad ministered weekly on days 1, 8 and 15 or twice 
weekly on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. The tr eated patient s had a median a ge of 65 years, 85% had 
acute myeloid leukemia and 78% had refr actory disease. Patients treated on the weekly 
schedule (N=42) r eceived 18-90 mg/m2 and th e M TD was found to be 72 mg/m2. Patient s 
treated on the twice- weekly schedule (N=31) r eceived 9-50 mg/m2 and th e MTD was 40 
mg/m2 . The DLT was stomatitis and th e primary non-hema tologic toxicity was reversible 
gastrointestinal sympto ms and febrile neutropenia. The 30-day a ll-cause mortality was 11%. 
Five patients had complete or incomplete re missions with a median duration of 3.1 months. 
A morphol ogic leukemia- free state (bone ma rrow blast reduced to <5%) o ccurred in 11 
additional patients. Antileukemic activity was a ssociated with total dose or weekly t ime 
abov e 1 μmol/L plasma vosaroxin concentration (p<0.05). Vosaroxin exposur e was dose 
proportional over 9-90 mg/m2 dose range The avera ge terminal half- lif e was ~25 h and 
clearance was non-renal. No induction or inhibition of vosaroxin metabo lism was evident. 
Vosaroxin-induced DNA dama ge was det ected a s incr eased intr acellular γH2AX. 
Phase 1/2 SPO-0012 Trial: Relapsed/Refractory AML 
This 
study a ssessed th e safety and tolerabil ity of vosaroxin plus cytarabine in patients 
with relapsed/refractory (AML).  13,22 Escalating vosaroxin doses (10- 90 mg/m 2; Days 
1 and 4) were given in combination with cytarabine using one of two schedules: 
Schedule A (24 -hour  continuous IV infusion, 400 mg/m 2/day, Days 1 -5) or Schedule B 
(2-hour IV infusion, 1 g/m 2/day, Days 1 and 5). Following dose escalation, enrollment 
was expanded at the MTD. Among the 110 patients enrolled, 108 received treatment. 
The MTD for schedule A was vosaroxin 80 mg/m 2 (dose -limiting toxicities: grade 3 
bowel obstruction and stomatitis); the MTD was not reached for schedule B 
(recommended phase 2 dose: 90 mg/m 2). In the efficacy population (all first relapsed or 
primary refractory patients treated wi th vosaroxin 80- 90 mg/m 2; N=69), the complete

were 25% and 28%, respectively. The 30-day a ll-cause mortality was 2.5% among all 
patients treated at 80-90 mg/m2. 
Phase 2 SPO-0014 Trial: Pr eviously Untreated AML  
This study evaluated single-agent vosaroxin in patients ≥60 y ears of age with previousl y 
untreated AML with an unfavorable prognosis (N=113).  23,24   Dose regimen optimi zation 
was explored in sequential cohorts (A: 72 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15;  B: 72 mg/m2 days 1, 8; C: 
72 mg/m2 or 90 mg/m2 days 1, 4). The pr imary endpoint was combined complete re mission 
(CCR) rate (complete re mission [ CR] plus CR with incomplete platelet r ecovery). Common 
(>20%) grade ≥3 adverse events were th rombocy topenia, febr ile neutropenia, anemia, 
neutropenia, sepsis, pneumonia, stomatitis, and hypokalemia. Overall CR and CCR r ates 
were 29% and 32%; median overall survival (OS) was 7.0 months; 1-year OS was 34% . 
Schedule C (72 mg/m2) had the most favorable safety and e fficacy profile, with faster 
hema tologic r ecovery (median 27 days) and lo west incidence of aggregate sepsis (24%) and 
30-day (7%) and 60-day (17%) all- cause mort ality. At this dose and schedule, CR and CCR 
rates were 31% and 35%, median OS was 7.7 months, and 1-y ear OS was 38%. Overa ll, 
vosaroxin resulted in low early mortality and an encouraging response rate; vosaroxin 72 
mg/m2 days 1, 4 is r ecommended for further study in this population. 
Phase 1/2 MD Ande rson Can cer Center Trial: Older patients w ith Newly D iagnosed AML 
and High Ris k MDS  
Patients e ligible  for enrollment in this study had AML or high-risk MDS (defined as 
having ≥ 10% blasts in th e bone ma rrow), were ≥60 years old and had adequate performance 
status (ECOG ≤ 2) and organ function. 25  Patients <[ADDRESS_19737] six patients r eceived 
vosaroxin 90 mg/m2 daily on da ys 1 and 4 with decitabine 20 mg/m2 daily for 5 days. This 
dose was 
well-tolerated and used for phas e 2 of th e study; ho wever, th e induction dose was 
reduced to 70 m g /m2 starting with patient 25 due to mucositis. The vosaroxin dose could be 
maintained at 70 mg/m2 or reduced to 50 mg/m2 in consolidation cycles, which were 
repeated in approximately 4 to 5- week intervals for a total of up to 7 cycles of vosaroxin and 
decitabine. Dose adjustments and dose delays o f one or both agents, were allowed b ased on 
toxicit y. 
The pr imary endpoint was t he overall respons e rate including complete respons e (CR) + 
CR witho ut platelet recovery ( CRp) + CR with insu fficient hema tological r ecovery (Cri) . 
Secondary endpoints were: CR duration, disease-free survival, overall survival, safety, and 
early mortality. At the t ime of this report, 34 patients with AML (N=31) and high-risk MDS 
(N=3) with a median age of 70 y ears (range, 41-78) had been enro lled and 33 (97%) were

with other miscellaneous abnormalities. T welve patients with AML (36% ) had ant eceden t 
hema tological disorders (A HD) includi ng MDS (N=7; 21%), myeloproliferative ne oplasm 
(N=3; 9%) and MD S/MPN (N=2; 6%). Three patients with AHD had r eceived prior therapy 
including 5- azacytidi ne (N=1), ruxolitinib + 5- azacytidi ne (N=1) and lenalido mide (N=1). 
Additionally, five patients (15%) had therapy- related disease with prior exposure to 
chem othe
rapy or radiation therapy. Median bone ma rrow blast%, median white bl ood cell, 
hemoglobin, and platelet counts were 38% (range, 9-97), 4.1 x 109/L (range, 0.4-57.0), 9.4 
g/dL (range, 6.8-11.5), and 41 x 109/L (range, 7-333), respectively. The patients evaluable 
for respons e (N=30) achieved C R (N=13; 43%), CRp (N=6; 20%), and CRi (N=3; 10%) for 
an overall respons e rate of 73%. . Patients had r eceived a median of 2 (range, 1-6) tr eatmen t 
cycles with the median nu mber of cycles to respons e being 1 (range, 1-4). The median 
duration of CR/CRp/ CRi had no t been r eached. Four patients had pro ceeded to all ogeneic 
stem cell transplant. The 4- and 8- week mortality rates were 0%  and 17%, respectively. The 
regimen was well tolerated with th e main grade ≥ 3 toxicity bei ng mucositis (N=8; 24%). 
Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, place bo-controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_20956] > 18 years of age with either refractory AML 
(persistent disease after induction, or first complete remission [CR1] < 90 d) or AML in first relapse (early relapse: CR1 of 90 d to 12 mo; late relapse: CR1 of 12 mo to 24 mo). Patients 
were allowed to have received [ADDRESS_19738] 
1 cycle of prior anthracycline (or anthracenedione) and cytarabine. Randomization was 
stratified by [CONTACT_20984] (refractory, early relapse, late relapse), age (< 60, ≥ 60 years), and 
geographic location (US, non- US). Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were overall 
survival (OS) and 30- and 60- day mortality; secondary endpoints were complete remission 
(CR) rate and incidence of adverse events (AEs).  
Enro llment occurred between December 2010 and September 2013 with 711patients 
randomized to receive either vosaroxin+cytarabine  (n = 356) or placebo+cytarabine (n = 355) at 124 sites.  Per the adaptive design, a prespecified 1 -time sample size increase of 225 
patients was implemented after the interim analysis.  At the final analysis, median OS was 7.5 mo (95% CI: 6.4- 8.5) with vos aroxin+cytarabine vs. 6.1 mo (95% CI: 5.2- 7.1) with 
pla/cyt (HR = 0.866 [95% CI: 0.73- 1.02]; 2- sided unstratified log -rank P = 0.06). The OS 
difference was statistically significant in a preplanned analysis accounting for the stratification factors at randomization (2 -sided stratified log -rank P = 0.02). 
Overall, 29.5% of patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant, including 45.8% 
of patients < 60 years and 20.2% of patients ≥ 60 years. Transplant rates were comparable between the 2 treatment arms (30.1% with vosaroxin+cytarabine and 29.0% with

was improved with vosaroxin+cytarabine (6.7 mo vs 5.3 mo with placebo+ cytarabine; HR = 
0.81 [95% CI: 0.67-0.97]; P = 0.02; stratified P = 0.03). In predefined subgroup analyses, 
OS benefit was greatest in p atients aged ≥ 60 years (7.1 mo with vosaroxin+cytarabine vs 
5.0 mo with placebo+cytarabine; HR = 0.75; P = 0.003) and those with early relapse (6.7 
mo vs 5.2 mo; HR = 0.77; P = 0.04). OS with vosaroxin+cytarabine vs. placebo+cytarabine 
was 9.1 mo vs 7.9 mo in patients < 60 years (HR = 1.08; P = 0.60); 6.7 mo vs 5.0 mo in 
patients with refractory disease (HR = 0.87; P = 0.23); and 14.1 mo vs 12.3 mo in patients 
with late relapse (HR = 0.98; P = 0.96), respectively. A CR was achieved in 30.1% of 
patients tre ated with vos aroxin+cytarabine vs. 16.3% treated with pla cebo+cytarabine ( P = 
0.[ZIP_CODE]). 
Thirty -day and 60- day all -cause mortality was similar in the 2 arms (30 -day: 7.9% vs 
6.6%; 60- day: 19.7% vs 19.4% with vos aroxin+cytarabine vs. pla cebo+cytarabine, 
respectively).  Most common serious AEs were febrile neutropenia (11.3% with 
vosaroxin+cytarabine vs. 7.4% with pla cebo /cytarabine ), sepsis (8.7% vs 4.3%), pneumonia 
(7.6% vs 4.9%), bacteremia (8.5% vs 2.9%), and stomatitis (3.4% vs 1.4%). Serious and non-serious cardiac, renal, neurologic, and hepatic AEs were compa rable between treatment 
groups. 
2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1. 
Primary Objectives 
• To assess the rate of complete remission (CR) after induction therapy with the 
combination of “7+V” [vosaroxin and standard dose infusional cytarabine] for 
patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia 
(AML)  
 
2.2. Secondary  Objectives

• To determine t ime to neutrophil and platelet recovery following “7+V” induction  
• To assess d isease free survival (DFS) at 1yr of patients achieving CR / CRi after 
“7+V” induction  
• To assess o verall survival (OS) at 1yr of all patients receiving protocol d efined 
therapy

2.3. Exploratory Objectives 
• To describe the mutational burden of this cohort of AML patients 
• To correlate genomic aberration with response rate, DFS, and OS 
• To determine the number of patients treated with vosaroxin who eventually go to 
allogeneic HSCT  
 
3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. Overall Design and Plan 
• Single -arm, open- label, phase II study of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine 
in patients with newly diagnosed AML.   
• Vosaroxin will be administered intravenously at 90 mg/m2 on days [ADDRESS_19739] fashion as a continuous infusion of 100 
mg/m2 daily on days 1-7.   Patients with evidence of residual leukemia on “Day 14 biopsy” following initial induction will be offered re -induction with intravenous vosaroxin at 70 mg/m2 
on days 1 and 4 in combination with continuous infusion cytarabine at 100 mg/m2 daily on days 1- 7. 
• Two-stage design.  Forty -one (41) patients will provide 80% power to detect a 
20% increase in complete remission rates (from 40% to 60%) with a Type I Error 
rate of 5%. The design permits one interim look to examine evidence of futility after the first 17 patients are evaluable for response.  If ≤ 7 patients achieve CR then the likelihood of reaching the goal endpoint of ≥ 60% remission would be diminished.  In this case, the DSMB (consisting of a repres entative from the 
funding organization, the study chairs, a biostatistician, and participating investigator to be selected by [CONTACT_20985]) will review the clinical data to determine the merits of continued enrollment.  If > 7 CRs are observed then the  
second stage will open automatically and increase enrollment to 41 patients.   
• Stage 1: First 17 patients who are evaluable for response prior to futility 
analysis  
• Stage 2: Patients 18 -41 enrolled after futility analysis    
 
• Likelihood- based assessment of the statistical evidence be used to determine the 
reliability of the data generated and will provide the option of adding one or two  
extension cohorts of 10 participants each if the initial trial results are inconclusive.

The treatment period will include up to two cycles of treatment (Induction 1, 
Induction 2).  In each cycle, the first day of study treatment will be considered day 1. 
Each cycle will include vosaroxin treatment on Days 1 and 4 and cytarabine on Days 1-7 
followed by a variable interval required to achieve hematologic recovery defined as 
absolute neutrophil  count (ANC) > 1000 cells/µL  and platelets > 100,000 cells/µL . 
Hematologic recovery is expected to occur approximately [ADDRESS_19740] treatment  day  of each cycle. Each cycle will be a minimum of 14 days and a maximum 
of 8 weeks.  
 5.2.1. Induction 1 
An early assessment of antileukemic activity (bone marrow biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) 
will be performed at approximately Day 14 for the sole purpose of guiding treatment 
decisions. If the early treatment assessment indicates an ablated bone marrow with < 5% blasts, CBC will be examined as noted in the schedule of events  thereafter to monitor for 
hematologic recovery.  
If the early treatment assessment indicates residual leukemia (≥ 5% blasts) and a 
second cycle is indicated in the judgment of the investigator, the investigator may initiate Induction 2 any date prior to Induction 1 day 57 (no later than 8 weeks after Induction 1, 
Day 1) if eligibility criteria are met. Bone marrow assessments may be repeated as 
necessary per standard of care (investigator discretion) to clarify or confirm a finding of residual leukemia.   In the event that blasts are ≥ 5% blasts, but ≤ 10% , the investigator 
may choose to pursue an additional bone marrow biopsy at a future date prior to making 
decision on whether Induction 2 is warranted. 
5.2.2 Induction 2  
Induction 2 will not be necessary for all patients, but may be appropriate if the 
Induction 1 early treatment or hematologic recovery assessment indicates residual 
leukemia is present, and if a second cycle is indicated in the judgment of the investigator.  
Eligibility for Induction 2 requires that non-hematologic toxicity and abnormal laboratory 
values be resolved to grade ≤ 1, if assessed by [CONTACT_20987]. Recovery of ANC , hemoglobin/hematocrit, and/or platelet counts is 
not required prior to Induction 2.

Consolidation therapy is  not defined by [CONTACT_760].  Patients achieving CR/CRi 
will proceed with consolidation therapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at 
the discretion of the treating physician in accordance with institutional practice.     
 
5.3. End of Treatment  
End of treatment procedures will be performed for all patients when study 
treatment is discontinued for any reason or another AML therapy is started, including 
conditioning regimens for transplantation. Every reasonable effort will be made to complete the pro cedures to prevent loss to follow up.  A separate visit may not be 
required, and the procedures performed at the last visit may satisfy the required end of 
treatment procedures. Ongoing serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed by [CONTACT_20988], stabilizes, is considered irreversible, or the patient receives a new AML therapy or dies. 
 
5.4. Follow- Up 
At the end of treatment, the purpose of follow -up will be to document survival 
status for all patients and to document disease status for patients in continuing CR or CRi. Every reasonable effort must be made to obtain information about patient status. In the 
event of death, additional information will be obtained, such as the date of death, cause of death, date of last contact, and laboratory and bone marrow results to document disease status at the time of death, such as continuing remission, relapse, persistent or recurrent leukemia. Follow -up for all patients will be  based on chart review and/or phone call 
every 3 months after completion of protocol defined therapy for one year .

6. STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION 
6.1. Vosaroxin Formulation 
Each vial contains 2,300 mg vosaroxin at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Each milliliter 
also contains [ADDRESS_19742] be stored as packaged  at controlled room temperature, 
thermostatically maintained from 20° C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). Do not store above 25°C.  
Stability data supports var iations in prevailing temperature between 15°C and 30°C.  
Vosaroxin must not be frozen or stored in a refrigerator. When vosaroxin is drawn into a 
syringe, stability data support a maximum of [ADDRESS_19743] is completely wrapped in foil or other  
protective covering from ultraviolet and visible light (e.g., amber bag, brown paper bag), 
this 2 -hour stability maximum can be extended up to 24 hours.  
 
6.3. Dose Calculation, Preparation, and Administration 
6.3.1. Dose Calculation 
The administration of study drugs  (vosaroxin and cytarabine) requires calculation 
of body surface area (BSA) using the patient’s actual, measured body weight and 
height. For patients with a BSA > 2.4 m2, dosing should be calculated using a maximum BSA of 2.4 m2. The Mosteller formula
29  is recommended to calculate 
BSA in m2; however, pharmacy personnel may calculate BSA according to 
institutional method.  
Mosteller formula: BSA (m2) =   �ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒ℎ𝑡  (𝑐𝑐) 𝑥 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑒ℎ𝑡 (𝑘𝑒)
3600   
 
6.3.2 Preparation and Administration of Vosaroxin 
Undiluted vosaroxin should be administered according  to these general guidelines:  
• Wear gloves and adhere to strict aseptic technique.  
• Inspect the vial and confirm it is not cracked or damaged in any way. 
• Inspect the solution and confirm it is not discolored and contains no visible 
particulates.  
• Do not infuse vosaroxin in the same IV line (tubing) with sodium chloride 
solutions or other medications. The product may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_20964].  If no alternative line is available, flushed saline thoroughly with 5% 
dextrose in water (D5W) before and after administration.

29 
CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  Suggested Procedure for Preparation  
• Calculate the dose according to physician instructions. 
• Attach an appropriate gauge needle to the tip of the sterile plastic syringe that will 
be used to administer vosaroxin. 
• Withdraw the product from the vosaroxin vial into the syringe.  Note:  a vacuum 
may result as the product is withdrawn.  Avoid or release the vacuum per 
institutional practice.  
Please note that if using a vent needle to aid in drawing investigational product 
from the vial, the vial should remain upright, and the vent needle should only be 
inserted into the head space containing air.  The needle used to withdraw product should be inserted as far as possible to the bottom of the vial to withdraw the required 
volume of drug. 
If pressurizing a vial, do not use a vent needle. Add the equivalent dose volume of 
air to the vial heads pace in the upright position, invert the vial, insert the syringe 
needle into the solution, and withdraw the required volume of drug. 
• When the syringe contains the entire dose to be administered, cap the syringe and 
discard the needle.  
• Protect the filled, capped syringe from light and whilst in transit to the patient 
until ready to administer the product.  
Suggested Procedure for Administration  
• A bil uminal or triluminal catheter is recommended.  Start an IV infusion through 
one of the lumens using D5W for analogous solution at a slow rate sufficient to 
keep the vein open. 
• Before administration of vosaroxin, increase the D5W infusion rate to 
approximately 100 mL per hour and continue this rate during the vosaroxin 
infusion. 
• Administer vosaroxin via syringe by [CONTACT_20989]. 
• Administer vosaroxin as a short infusion within 10 minutes, either manually or using a syringe pump. 
• At the end of the infusion, flushed the IV line with D5W per institutional 
standard. 
• If a central catheter or heparin lock is in place, it may be capped according to the 
sites usual procedures. 
Vosaroxin is not known to be a thoracic and/or irritant.  If extravasation is 
observed or suspected, treat according to standard institutional procedures.

Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  7. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Concomitant medications are recommended as prophylaxis for nausea, vomiting, and 
infections, and Darvon for managing myelosuppression as shown in table 2. 
 
Myelosuppression is expected in patients with AML due to underl ying disease, as well as 
due to chemotherapy (such as vosaroxin and cytarabine), or both. Most patients will have neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or both at study entry. Myelosuppression may be managed 
with growth factor support and blood transfusion according to institutional standard of care, 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Practice Guidelines, and NCCN Practice Guidelines.  
 
Infections secondary to myelosuppression are common in patients with AML, and may 
be related to underlying disease, chemotherapy, or both. Therefore, the use of prophylactic 
antibiotics, antifungal agents, and antiviral agents is required . A regimen of levofloxacin 
(500 mg po daily), fluconazole (400 mg po daily), and valacyclovir (500 mg po q12h)  is 
suggested with substit utions permitted as per institutional formulary . (See Appendix E)

Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  8. DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT  
Treatment may be discontinued for a variety of reasons, including patient withdrawal,  
investigator decision, and reasons specified by [CONTACT_760]. 
8.1. Discontinuation Criteria for Individual Patients  
 
8.1.1. Patient  Withdrawal  
Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the clinical 
study at  any time and  without giving any reason. Their withdrawal will not 
jeopardize their relationship with their healthcare providers or affect their future 
care. Patients may also choose to withdraw from study treatment, but agree to remain in the study for follow up procedures. 
 
8.1.2. Investigator Discontinuation of Patient  
The investigator may exercise medical judgment to discontinue study treatment if clinically significant changes in clinical status or laboratory values are noted.  
 
8.1.3. Criteria for Protocol -Defined Required Discontinuation of Treatment  
The protocol requires discontinuation of study treatment for the following reasons:  
• Maximum allowed treatment completed  
• Failure to achieve a CR or CRi after 2 attempts (Induction 1 / 2) 
• Disease relapse after a CR  or CRi 
• Clinic ally significant neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the absence of 
residual leukemia that does not recover to grade ≤ [ADDRESS_19745] dose of vosaroxin in any cycle 
• Clinically significant treatment related non -hematologic AE in the absenc e 
of residual leukemia that does not recover to grade ≤ [ADDRESS_19746] dose of vosaroxin in any cycle  
• Any AE that is unacceptable or intolerable  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents the next cycle of treatment  
• Pregnancy  
• Other non-protocol systemic AML therapy or prohibited medication 
initiated  
• General or specific changes, including protocol violations, rendering the  
patient unsuitable for further study treatment

10. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
10.1. Safety Monitoring 
10.1.1. Common Adverse Events Attributed to Vosaroxin  
The safety profile of vosaroxin is consistent with the common 
pharmacologic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.  Myelosupression 
(including associated fatal infections) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (including 
nausea, diarrhea, and upper GI mucositis) are known risks associated with 
vosaroxin treatment.  Oral mucositis (stomatitis) was the DLT in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with higher doses of vosaroxin:  up to 40 mg/m
2 
once weekly for 4 weeks (28-day cycle) or up to 90 mg /m2 once weekly for 3 
weeks (28 day cycle; up to 270 mg/m2/cycle). In patients treated with   vosaroxin, 
oral mucositis is dose limiting and grade [ADDRESS_19747] recent reference safety information (IB, Version 12), 
infections and febrile neutropenia were reported at a higher frequencies in patients 
with hematologic malignancies (39.7% and 36.9 of 648 patients respectively) than in patients with solid tumors (12.3% and 9.2% of 284 respectively). The GI toxicities of stomatitis and diarrhea were also reported at higher frequencies in patients with hematologic malignancies (46.8% and 47.7% respectively) than in 
7+V induction for untreated AML   IST2014 -VOS -002 
35 
CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  patients with solid tumors (11.3% and 17.3% respectively). For patients with 
hematologic malignancies who received vosaroxin (N = 648), the most common treatment -related  AEs (with at least 20% incidence) include nausea (53.2%), 
diarrhea (47.7%), stomatitis (46.8%), febrile neutropenia (36.9%), decreased appetite (31.3%), vomiting (30.1%), anemia (29.0%), thrombocytopenia (28.5%), neutropenia (20.1%), and fatigue (21.0%). The only two grade [ADDRESS_19748] 20% of all vosaroxin treated patients (N = 932) are febrile neutropenia (26.4%) and neutropenia (21.5).  
 
For patients with AML treated with higher doses of vosaroxin, oral mucositis is dose limiting  and grade [ADDRESS_19749] supportive care (Appendix E). The incidence of combined grade 3 and 4 nausea and vomiting in vosaroxin studies is low (2.7% and 1.4% respectively). 
In general, adverse reactions are manageable with standard and diligent 
supportive care. Myelosuppression and GI toxicities should be managed 
according to Appendix E within the protocol. 
 
10.2. Overdose     
An overdose is defined as administering at least 25% more than the  
protocol-specified dose (i.e., ≥125% of the protocol- specified dose). Overdoses 
should be reported to the Coordi nating Center regardless if occurrence of adverse 
event within 24 business hours of discovery as instructed per section 11.6. The 
clinical manifestation (if any) of an overdose should be reported as an AE or 
SAE, as appropriate. 
 
10.2.1. Pregnancy   
During the course of the trial, all female patients of childbearing potential 
(the definition of “women of childbearing potential” is listed in Appendix D), 
must contact [CONTACT_20991] (a missed or late menstrual period should be reported to the treating investigator) after the first dose of study treatment until end -of-treatment 
procedures are performed.   
Male patients that suspect they may have impregnated a partner must also 
notify the treating investigator immediately. If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant prior to administration of trial drug(s), the trial drug(s) must be withheld until the result of the pregnancy test is confirmed.   
If a pregnancy is confirmed, the patient must not receive any trial drug(s), 
and must be discontinued from the trial, and the investigator must notify the Coordinating Center as soon as possible. The Coordinating Center  will report the 
pregnancy to a Sunesis representative.

 Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
Includes adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
11.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Reports  
Simple, unbiased questions should be asked to elicit reports of AEs during the  
clinical study. For example: 
• How have you felt since your last visit?  
• Have you had any health problems since you were last here?  
 
11.3. Assessment and Recording  of Adverse Events  
All AEs grade [ADDRESS_19751] be 
assessed and recorded as follows:  
• Name [CONTACT_12581] (diagnosis preferred, otherwise state signs and 
symptoms)  
• Date of onset and stop date (if available) 
• Course (i.e., intermittent, ongoing) 
• Maximum intensity or severity (grade) based on the NCI CTCAE version 
4.03 
• Relationship to study treatment 
• Seriousness 
• Outcome 
• Use of concomitant medication to treat a patient for an AE

Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553   
Adverse events of special interest that occur at grade [ADDRESS_19752] are: mucositis, infection, 
neutropenia, diarrhea , and thrombocytopenia. 
11.4. Guidelines for Recording Adverse Events  
Each reportable AE should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. If 
this is  not possible, the signs or symptoms should be documented until a  medical 
diagnosis is identified. If an AE resolves and reoccurs at a later  date, a new AE 
must be documented and reported as appropriate. The  following guidelines should 
be followed to improve the quality and precision of AE data: 
• Recognized medical terms (not colloquialisms, abbreviations, or  jargon) 
should be used when recording AEs 
• The diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) should be recorded instead of 
signs and symptoms (e.g., pneumonia instead of shortness of  breath, 
coughing, and fever) 
• Any sign or symptom considered as unrelated to an encountered disease or syndr ome should be recorded as an individual AE (e.g., if  nausea and 
severe headache are observed at the same time, each  event should be 
recorded as a separate AE)  
• Adverse events  occurring within 30 days after EOT should be reported. 
 
11.5. Intensity of the Adverse Event  
The investigator will grade each reportable AE based on its maximum 
intensity  (or severity) using the NCI CTCAE  V4.03 (available at: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html).
 31  If no grading criteria are 
provided for the AE, it should be graded using the s cale presented in Table 5,  
noting that not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. 
 
11.6. Adverse Event Attribution  
The investigator will determine the attribution of toxicity relative to the 
vosaroxin, cytarabine, other concomitant medication, or other medical causes in 
accordance with the ICH E2A guidelines.

11.7. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
Study site personnel must report all SAEs  by [CONTACT_20992] , but within  [ADDRESS_19753] becoming aware of  the 
SAE. The following minimum in formation is required by [CONTACT_456]: 
• Patient identification (i.e., study number, sex, age) 
• Description of the SAE (diagnosis preferred, symptoms, etc.) 
• Investigator name 
• Study drug and causal relationship of the SAE to the study drug(s)  
The SAE report should be submitted via secure email transfer or via fax using the 
contact [CONTACT_20986]: 
Attn: VICC Mult i-Institutional Coordinating Center  
Fax:  [PHONE_334]

should be documented.  
 
11.8. General Instructions for Reporting Serious Adverse Events to  the FDA and
 Sunesis  Pharmaceuticals  
 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
FDA regulations and statutory provisions establish adverse event  reporting 
requirements for human drugs. These requirements apply to the manufacturer of the product in question. In general, manufacturers of prescription drugs marketed 
for human use are required to submit  postmarketing safety reports of adverse drug 
experiences to FDA.
a A report of each adverse drug experience that is both 
serious and unexpected must be made to FDA as soon as possible, but no later 
than 7 days for a life -threatening or fatal event, and 15 days for all others after 
receiving information about the event.b Persons required to file such 15- day Alert 
reports are also required to investigate and submit any new information to FDA.c 
The Sponsor is responsible for reporting SAEs to the FDA. 
SAE supporting documents, such as a discharge summary or pertinent 
laboratory data may be provided; however, the study personnel should not wait to 
receive complete information before notifying the Coordinating Ce nter of an 
SAE. The study site is responsible for requesting pertinent follow -up information 
missing from initial reports and forwarding the information within [ADDRESS_19754]  additional information if necessary.  
a 21 C.F.R. §§ 310.305(c); 314.80(c); 314.98 (human drugs), 600.80(c) (biologics).  To avoid duplication of 
reports, non-applicant manufacturers, packers, and  distributors of drug and biological products having an 
approved application may  submit all reports of serious adverse drug experiences to the applicant within 5 
calendar days of receipt of information about the event, rather than submitting  reports to FDA. See 21 C.F.R.  
 §§ 314.80(c)(1)(iii), 600.80(c)(1)(iii). Similarly,  packers and distributors of pr escription drug products 
marketed for human use  without an approved application may meet their post -marketing 15 -day safety  
reporting obligations under 21 C.F.R. § 310.305 by [CONTACT_20995] 5 calendar days of the receipt  of information instead of reporting to FDA. 
Applicants/manufacturers receiving  such data must then, in turn, submit a 15- day Alert report to FDA.

12. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
12.1. Statistical Considerations 
The primary objective of this single -arm, phase II clinical trial is to determine if 
Vosaroxin, in combination with standard dose cytarabine as induction chemotherapy, 
can significantly improve the rate of complete remission (CR) in patients with untreated acute myelocytic leukemia.  F orty-one (41) patients will be enrolled in a 
two-stage design that permits one interim look to examine evidence of futility. As per 
convention, the study will not be stopped early on the basis of preliminary evidence of efficacy observed at the end of the first stage (i.e., at the interim look).  
 
12.2. Sample Size Considerations  
In accordance with our desire to maintain a uniform study design, we set a total 
sample size of 41 participants.  An interim futility analysis will be conducted 
following enrollment of 17 evaluable patients.  If ≤ 7 patients achieve CR then the likelihood ratio in support of reaching the goal endpoint of  ≥ 60% remission would 
be diminished and  the data would then be reviewed by a DSMB to determine if 
further enrollment is warranted.  If > [ADDRESS_19755] 17 evaluable patients, enrollment will automatically proceed to enroll a total of 41 patients.  Under 
this two -stage design, a 60% complete remission rate by [CONTACT_941] “7+V” combination is at 
least 3.375 times more likely than a 40% CR rate if 22 or more patients experience CR. 
In the context of the planned likelihood assessment the option will be provided to 
add an extension cohort of up to 20 participants if the initial trial results are 
inconclusive. The use of a likelihood based extension cohort results in false positive 
and false discovery  rates of 3.7% and 3.9%, respectively. 
 
12.3. Study Design

futility are common in this setting. Simon’s optimal two -stage design

42 
CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  We will em ploy the  likelihood ratio (LR), not a tail area probability (p-value), 
to represent the strength of statistical evidence with respect to either a 40% or 60% 
true CR rate. Likelihood ratios are positive and a LR of 1 indicates completely neutral 
evidence. S mall likelihood ratios (LR ≪1) indicate evidence for the null hypothesis 
and large likelihood ratios (LR ≫1) indicate evidence for the alternative. The scale of 
evidence is truly continuous, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a gradual shift from weak to moderate to 
strong evidence.  
 
An important advantage is that, unlike p- values, likelihood ratios have three 
evidential zones: evidence favoring the null hypothesis, evidence favoring the 
alternative hypothesis, and weak or inconclusive evidence (i.e., favoring neither 
hypothesis). Of c ourse, p -values have only two zones: evidence against the null 
hypothesis (p<0.05) and inconclusive evidence (p>0.05; large p- values do not 
constitute stronger evidence in favor of the null hypothesis). Moreover, the likelihood 
false discovery rate is easi ly quantifiable as 1/(LR+1). Thus, an observed likelihood 
ratio of 4 (supporting the alternative) has a false discovery rate of 20%. Lastly, 
likelihood designs have excellent operating characteristics.  
 
Parameters and assumptions : For planning purposes, we  assume the complete 
remission rate of standard induction chemotherapy is 40% in the targeted population of this trial and that the use of Vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine may increase this rate to 60%. We plan to enroll a total of 41 patients, but  provide the 
option of adding an extension cohort of 10 to 20 participants if the initial trial results 
are inconclusive.  
 
Two-stage single -arm phase II designs : There are many two -stage designs that 
meet nominal Type I and II Error criteria.  We choose a two-stage design with a 
slightly increased expected sample size (EN ) of 25.6 but keeps the two- stage sample 
size below that of a single -stage study (n=42) as follows: In stage I, 17 patients are 
accrued and the study is stopped only if 7 or fewer patients experience a complete 
remission (CR). Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_20968]. If 8 or more patients experience a CR, the study continues to accrue an additional 24 
participants (for a total of 41). At the end, the study is said to generate evidence in 
support of the hypothesis that incorporating Vosaroxin into frontline AML induction chemotherapy is worthy of future study if 22 or more patients experience CR (i.e. if 
the observed response rate is greater than 53%). If frontline induction therapy with 
Vosaroxin plus standard dose continuous infusion cytarabine fails to improve upon the historical CR rate of 40% with conventional 7+3 induction therapy, the study has a 64% probability of early termination (PET).

CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  A standard (frequentist)  two-stage design is unable to handle deviations from 
its planned design (i.e., when the sample size is anything other than 17 or 41). This 
occasionally happens in multi -center clinical trials for practical reasons relating to the 
speed of communication and clinical expediency. Green and Dahlberg33 introduced 
flexible designs to that are able to accommodate such deviations from planed designs 
with minimal impact to their nominal operating characteristics. However, in this case, the Green and Dahlberg criteria result in a 25% PET, which poorly protects patients 
from ineffective therapy . Thi s is one motivating factor in our choice of employing a 
likelihood- based assessment of the evidence.  The likelihood ratio reveals alternative 
interim stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_20969] I and Type II Error rates, adding significant logistic flexibility (Table 6). Within the context of standard two- stage 
design , we believe our proposed design best balances the probability of early 
termination and expected sample size under the stated constraints.

Likelihood assessment of evidence : In accordance with our desire to maintain a 
uniform study design, we set a total sample size of [ADDRESS_19757] stage if the observed likelihood ratio is less 
than 1/3.375 (i.e., if the evidence better supports the null hypothesis by a factor of at 
least 3.375). The likelihood ratio is defined as 𝐿𝐿=𝜃

CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  An important aspect of the likelihood assessment is that it can quantify the 
reliability of an observed outcome. For example, while the study would stop early with 
either an observed LR of 1/3.375 or 1/15 (evidence favoring the null hypothesis), the 
assoc iated false discovery rates of 0.23 (=1/4.375) and 0.063 (=1/16), respectively, 
distinguish between those results and provide critical information for investigators when 
interpreting this evidence at the end of the study. 
 
With a likelihood design, it can happen that the trial yields weak or inconclusive 
evidence. Technically this can happen in all standard (i.e., frequentist) two -stage designs 
as well, but when it does the standard design forces a ‘call’ of either ‘Reject the null’ or 
‘Fail to reject the n ull’ (the assignment depends on how the Type I Error is spent 
throughout the study and can lead to some uncomfortable circumstances, such as calling evidence supporting the alternative as ‘Fail to reject’ and vice versa). Hence, in likelihood designs, it i s desirable to minimize the chance of observing weak evidence. 
Our proposed two- stage design accomplished this sufficiently, as we next describe, but 
the important thing to remember is that if the trial does result in weak evidence there is no penalty for accruing additional subjects and reporting the combined evidence (assuming that resources will allow such action). In a likelihood design, the probability of weak evidence is driven to zero by [CONTACT_20997], so it is always possible to refine 
inconclusive results, often within limited resource constraints.  
 
Table [ADDRESS_19759] to 
happen, on average, for our proposed design and what happens if the sponsor chooses to 
add patients at the end of the trial to refine weak evidence (if observed). In particular, it shows that the chance of observing weak evidence at the end of the study is ~8%, which can be reduce to ~3% (or ~1%) by [CONTACT_1583] 10 (or 20) more participants. Importantly, only 
an additional [ADDRESS_19760] inflation in the Type I Error rate from 4.9% (=247/5000) to 6%, and 286 trials under the alternative achieved sufficient evidence to declare efficacy for an increase in power from 
80% (=4026/5000) to 86%.  At the end of stage II, the false discovery rate for any type of 
rejection (i.e., any likelihood ratio greater than or equal to 3.375) is 5.8% (=247/ 
(247[PHONE_338])).  Clearly, cohort expansion can proceed with minimal rates of unwanted consequences.

Under the likelihood evidentiary paradigm observed results are reported as 
follows (let K>1 be the pre -specified LR that mainta ins a certain false discovery rate): 1) 
sufficiently strong evidence for the null ( LR ≤ 1/K ) ; 2) actionable weak evidence for the 
null ( 1/K<LR<1 ) ; 3) actionable weak evidence for the alternative ( 1<LR<K) ;  4) 
sufficiently strong evidence for the alternative ( LR ≥ 1/K ). We will also report the FDR 
for the result at hand, i.e. 1/(LR+1).  As detailed below, this trial may recruit additional 
participants if the observed LR is weak (i.e., 1/K<LR<K  ) with a maximum of 61 
participants.  
A significant number (~8%)  of discoveries under the null and alternate 
hypotheses for our two- stage design had LR of exactly 3.375. Though such results  would 
allow the conclusion of  sufficient activ ity to warrant further investigation in more 
definitive trials because it passes nominal Type I and II Error rate criteria, we propose to 
further evaluate these results in the extension cohorts by [CONTACT_20998] K=4, treating those trials with LR’s of 3.375 as weak evidence. The PET remains unaffected by [CONTACT_20999]. 
However, the design that uses K=4 and a total sample size of 61 patients has a false 
positive rate that decreases to 3.7% and power that increases to 83.7%. This strategy also 
decreases the false discovery rate to 3.9% (table 8 ). Hence such a design is quite feasible.

General Statistical Considerations and Analysis Plan  
 
Categorical variables (e.g. gender, response) will be summarized in frequ ency 
tables using counts and percentage of patients by [CONTACT_19313]. Continuous variables (e.g. age) 
will be summarized using the minimum and maximum values, quartiles, mean and standard deviation.  95% confidence intervals will be estimated for all variables.  A ll 
comparisons will be two -sided and statistical significance is declared for p -values < 0.05.  
All patients receiving at least one dose of therapy will be included in efficacy and safety analyses.  
12.4.     Definition of Endpoints  Response for Interim Analysis.    
Response for interim analysis will be defined as the best response prior to or on the 
day-84 bone marrow biopsy.  
• Leukemia- free Survival (LFS or DFS) is defined as the time from complete remission 
to disease progression or death for any reason.  Patients who are disease free and alive 
as of last follow -up will be censored at their last follow -up date. 
• Event- free survival is defined as the time from start of therapy to progression or death 
for any reason.  Patient progression- free and alive at last  follow- up will be censored 
at their last follow -up date. 
• Overall survival is defined at the time from start of therapy to death for any reason.  
Patients alive as of last follow -up will be censored at their last follow -up date.

Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  12.5.     Statistical Comparisons 
Categorical variables will be compared among important patient subgroups using 
the chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.  Continuous variables will be 
compared using rank based non- parametric tests.  Survival distributions will be estimated 
using the method of Kaplan and Meier and comparing these distributions among patient 
subgroups will be made using the logrank test.  Multivariable models of response and survival estimates will be constructed using logistic and Cox (proportional hazar ds) 
regression.  Time to response will be implemented as a time -dependent covariate in 
models assessing LFS.  
 
12.6.     Safety Analysis 
Adverse events and laboratory data will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 
version 4.03.  As described above frequency and percentage of patients will be summarized for any adverse event by [CONTACT_479], attribution, organ class, and preferred term overall and by [CONTACT_4676].  Change in continuous laboratory data from just prior to therapy 
and by [CONTACT_21000].  Linear and non- linear 
regression will be used to model changes over time, accounting for intra -patient 
correlation using mixed models or GEE, as appropriate.

the IRB for ethical review and approval if required by [CONTACT_427], prior to the 
trial start.   
Information regarding study conduct and progress will be reported to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) per the current institutional standards of each 
participating institution.  
The Study Chair (or his designee) is responsible for the coordination and 
development of all protocol amendments. Once approved by [CONTACT_21003], Vanderbilt 
will disseminate this information to participating institutions.  
IRB approval for protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent 
document must be obtained per the current institutional standards at each 
participating institution.  
Any change to the protocol and informed consent document must be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_21004]/Independent Ethics Committee at participating institutions. Amendments should not be implemented until all necessary approvals have been obtained, except when necessary to eliminate an immediate haz ard to study subjects. 
Safety updates for will be prepared by [CONTACT_21005], for 
submission to the relevant IRB. 
 
13.1.3. Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process by [CONTACT_9444] a subject voluntarily confirms his or her 
willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.  Informed consent is documented by [CONTACT_3553] a written, signed and dated informed consent form.

49 
CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  The informed consent form will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is 
responsible for review and approval of the trial.  Each consent form must include all 
of the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_1622], as well as local county 
authority or state regulations and national requirements. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial, each prospective candidate will 
be given a full explanation of the trial.  Once the essential information has been 
provided to the prospective candidate, and the investigator is sure that the individual 
candidate understands the implications of participating in this trial, the candidate will 
be asked to give consent to participate in the trial by [CONTACT_21006]. A notation that written informed consent has been obt ained will be made in the 
patient’s medical record. A copy of the informed consent form, to include the 
patient’s signature, will be provided by [CONTACT_21007].   
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the trial design or the  
potential risks to the patients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the 
trial must be obtained.  
Any change to the informed consent document must be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_21008]/Independent Ethics Committee at participating institutions.  
 
13.1.4. Data Collection 
The trial CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the trial. CRFs will be 
completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable the 
monitor to review the patients’ status throughout the course of the trial. 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only trial number, patient number, initials and 
date of birth will identify the patient in the CRF.  If the patient’s name [CONTACT_21016] o n any 
other document (e.g. laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to Coordinating Center  and replaced instead with the patient 
number and patient’s initials.  The investigator will maintain a personal patient 
identification list (patient numbers with corresponding patient identifiers) to enable 
records to be identified and verified as authentic.  Patient data/information will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
All data requested on the CRF must be supported by [CONTACT_21009]’s source documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the CRF, a note should be created verifying that 
the field was “Not Done” or “Unknown”.  For any entry errors made, the error(s) 
must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided.

CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  The investigator  will electronically sign and date the patient CRF casebook 
indicating that the data in the CRF has been assessed.  Each completed CRF will be 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_978], once all data for that patient are final.  
 
13.1.5. Trial  Monitoring  
Vital Study Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
The VITAL Study DSMB (consisting of a representative from the funding 
organization, the study chairs, a biostatistician, and participating investigator to be 
selected by [CONTACT_20985]) will review the clinical data to determine the merits of 
continued enrollment. 
VICC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
Quarterly safety and monitoring reports are available to the DSMC as determined 
by [CONTACT_21010] (SRC). The DSMC reviews all adverse events report ed during the previous month for all clinical trials active at the VICC and 
makes recommendations to address concerns of patient safety. The DSMC of the VICC SRC will submit an annual report to the VICC Director on activities of the preceding year and will  make recommendations to improve data and safety 
monitoring activities as needed.  
A Quality Assurance auditor under the direction of the VICC DSMC will audit 
this clinical trial quarterly for compliance with adverse event reporting, regulatory and studies requirements, and data accuracy and completion. Audit reports detailing the findings are provided to the DSMC. 
Investigators will allow auditors access to all pertinent medical records, as 
required by [CONTACT_17926], in order to allow for the verification of data gathered in the data case report forms (CRFs) and for the review of the data collection process. At visits, the auditor may review various aspects of the trial including, but not limited 
to: screening and enrollment logs; compliance with the p rotocol and with the 
principles of Good Clinical Practice; completion of case report forms; source data 
verification; study drug accountability and storage; facilities and staff; and regulatory compliance.  
VICC Multi-Institutional Coordinating Center 
The trial additionally will be monitored by [CONTACT_21011]- Institutional 
Coordinating Center. The actual frequency of monitoring will depend on the enrollment rate and performance of the site. Monitoring will be conducted through onsite and remote monitoring, teleconferences with the Investigator and site staff, and 
appropriate communications by [CONTACT_2319], fax, email, or telephone. The purpose of

CONFIDENTIAL – VITAL Study  Version 1.10  18 January 2016  
Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  monitoring is to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol, 
standard operating procedures (SOPs), and other written instructions, and to ensure the quality and integrity of the data. 
During scheduled monitoring visits, investigators and the investigational site staff 
must be available to discuss the progress of the trial, make necessary correctio ns to 
case report form entries, respond to data clarification requests, provide required regulatory documents, and respond to any other trial-related inquiries of the monitor. 
In addition to the above, the FDA may review the conduct or results of the study 
at the investigational site.  
 
13.1.6. Closure of the Study  
The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue a site at any time during the study for 
medical or administrative reasons such as:  
• Unsatisfactory enrollment; 
• GCP noncompliance; 
• Inaccurate or incomplete data collection;  
• Falsification of records;  
• Failure to adhere to the study protocol. 
 
13.1.7. Records Retention  
U.S. FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) require that records and documents 
pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, 
including CRFs, consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_21012] [INVESTIGATOR_20972]. If no application is filed, these records must be kept tw o years after the study is 
discontinued and the U.S. FDA and the applicable national and local health authorities 
are notified.  
Following closure of the study, each participating center will maintain a copy of all 
site study records in a safe and secure lo cation. The Sponsor will inform the Investigator 
at each site at such time that the records may be destroyed.

The diagnosis of AML required a marrow or blood blast count of 20% or more, except 
for AML with t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16), and some cases of erythroleukemia. 
Myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts are included in the blast count. 
Monoblasts and promonocytes, but not abnormal monocytes, are counted as blast 
equivalents in AML with monocytic or myelomonocytic differentiation. Erythroblasts are 
not counted as blasts except in the rare instance of pure erythroid leukemia.

Coordinating Center Protocol Number:  VICCHEM1553  Appendix D:  Contraceptive Guidelines and Pregnancy  
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are Defined as Follows: 
Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 
months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate cl inical profile (e.g. age 
appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL [for US only: and estradiol < 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy ) at least six weeks ago. In the case of 
oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by 
[CONTACT_6592]. 
Contraceptive Guidelines for Women of Chi ld-Bearing Potential: 
 Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and for 60 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. The highly effective contraceptio n is defined as either: 
1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
2. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or 
tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_104].  
3.  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.  
4.  Use of a combination of two of the following: 
a)   Barrier methods with spermicide:  
• condom (male or female)  
• occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps/shield) 
• use of two barrier methods is acceptable (i.e. male condom + diaphragm or equivalent) 
b)  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  
c)  Hormonal implants or combined oral contraceptives 
• Please note it is unknown if vosaroxin may have the potential to decrease the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

The following are unacceptable forms of contraception for women of childbearing potential:  
• Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
• Fertility awareness  
• Withdrawal  
Appendix E.  Prophylactic antimicrobials and mucositis care recommendations  
Prophylactic antimicrobials  
Patients should be on antimicrobial prophylaxis for duration of the immunocompromised 
periods during the trial.  This connotes prophylaxis from diagnosis through count recovery  (minimum ANC > 500 /µl or institutional practice; whichever is greater ).  There 
should be three lines of antimicrobial prophylaxis.  These should include: 
Antibacterial (e.g. Levafloxacin  500mg po daily) 
Antifungal (e.g. Fluconazole 400mg po daily) Antiviral (e.g. Valacyclovir 500mg po dail y) 
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_20973].  
Consistent with IDSA recommendations, patients with oral or gastrointestinal mucositis that interferes with swallowing or causes severe diarrhea as well as those with 
gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, or diarrhea should be considered at high- risk for serious complications in the setting of neutropenic 
fever and should receive empi[INVESTIGATOR_20974].

Mucositis care recommendations  (extrapolated from MAASC  Practice G uidelines ) 
Oral Mucositis  
1. We recommend the use of oral cryotherapy on days 1 and 4 of vosaroxin infusions for 
mucositis prevention.  Ice cubes / chips should be placed in patient’s mouth starting 5 minutes prior to vosaroxin infusion and continuing for a total of 30 minutes duration.   
2. We recommend patient controlled analgesia with morphine (or alternative narcotic pain 
medication as deemed appropriate per treating physician) be used to treat pain due to oral 
mucositis in patients receiving protocol defined chemotherapy.

i. Transdermal fentanyl, morphine mouthwash (0.2%), and doxepin 
mouthwash (0.5%) may also be effective to treat pain due to oral 
mucositis .  
3. Zinc supplements administered orally may also be considered to prevent oral mucositis.   
4. Oral care with salt and soda rinses or alternatives as per institutional practice are also allowed.   
5. We recommend avoidance of prophylactic use of antimicrobial lozenges, antimicrobial mouthwash, sucralfate mouthwash, chlorhexidine mouthwash, GM -CSF mouthwash,

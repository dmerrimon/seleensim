 4 1. UPDATE HISTORY  
 
Date  Summary  
02/20/[ADDRESS_1166575] be optimized to prepare at -risk patients for major 
surgery. As such, our program  interventions target major risk factors that are modifiable 
yet rarely addressed in the pre- surgery period (physical function, nutrition, pain, sleep, 
anxiety, and cognition). We also aim to determine how these interventions c an best be 
delivered for optimal participation.  
Participants will receive [ADDRESS_1166576], nutrition 
education with a registered dietitian, meditation with an experienced meditation teacher, and cognitive behavi oral intervention to discuss goals, facilitators and barriers to program 
adherence with the goal to enhance motivation and promote self -efficacy. Two (2) follow -
up assessments  will additionally be performed at days 30 and 90. Further details of the 
intervention are provided below:  
• Exercise training with home/virtual/in- center physical therapy will take place on 
average t wice a week for 1 hour per session over 3- 4 weeks. The participant will  be 
encouraged to exercise on their  own for 30 minutes per day for 4 or more days a week 
and track exercise in a diary (number of minutes achieved per day). They  will also be 
asked to wear a physical activity tracking device (Fitbit Fitness tracker) to measure daily number of steps, act ive minutes, and heart rate. This device will also remind the 
participant  to get up and move throughout the day.  
• Nutrition class with a licensed nutrit ionist (registered dietitian) will take place on 
average once a week for 1 hour per session over 3- 4 weeks. The participant will also 
be as ked to drink/consume 1 high calorie, high protein nutritional supplement per day 
which will be provided to them  by [CONTACT_1758].  They will be asked to write down their  
approximate daily food intake in a diary (3 days/week) –  this will b e an informal 
accounting of their  intake with the primary focus being on protein- containing food 
items. This informati on will be used to measure their protein intake during their  
participation in the study.  
• Meditation with a yoga/meditation teacher will take place once a week f or [ADDRESS_1166577] 12 minutes each day and track in a diary (number of minutes 
achieved each day).  
• Weekly check -in calls will take place  once a week for  about 30 minutes per sssion 
over 3- 4 weeks. During these calls the participant will talk about their goals, discuss 
personal motivation, and review their progress. They will be asked about any potential adverse events (such as sore muscles or falls).  
• A [ADDRESS_1166578] at the end of the intervention (in week s 
3 or 4). The participant will be asked to provide feedback  discussing what parts of the 
 6 intervent ion work ed well and what did not. We will use this information for protocol 
refinement.  
The primary outcome is the feasibility of the prehabilitation protocol , defined as the 
proportion of patients to whom we can deliver an adequate dose ( ≥50% of the planned 
sessions) of the 3 core interventions : physical therapy (≥4/8 se ssions), nutrition (≥2/4 
sessions), and meditation (≥2/4 sessions) .  Secondary outcomes  include 1) self -reported 
and objective measures of adherence; 2) patient -centered outcomes, measured using 
PROMIS physical, cognitive, depression, anxiety, and fatigue domains at baseline, 
following completion of the prehabilitation (before surgery),  and on postoperative day s 30 
and 90; 3) clinical outcomes (3- D Confusion Assessment Method,1 a composite 
complication score,2 length of stay, and 30- day readmission and death); and 4) 
Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale3 to be obtained around postoperative day 3.  
 
The proposed research will provide necessary information for a larger randomized 
controlled trial  (RCT) . 
 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_839446] a prehabilitation program in 
frail older adults undergoing major surgery . Our central hypothesis is that  optimizing risk 
factors before surgery with a multicomponent prehabilitation protocol will improve postoperative outcomes in high- risk older adults under going major elective abdominal, 
gynecological oncologic, and urologic surgery. By [CONTACT_14662] a patient -centered 
multicomponent protocol, the most effective intervention strategies of the protocol can be refined for a larger scale randomized controlled trial . This research has four (4) 
intervention components: 1) physical therapy; 2), nutrition;  3) meditation; and 4)  cognitive 
behavioral strategies will additionally be utilized to enhance motivation and support self -
efficacy. We will accomplish the following two (2) specific aims : 
 
3.1 Objective/ Aim 1.  To evaluate the feasibility of and adherence to the 
prehabilitation program. We will estimate the duration of preoperative geriatric 
assessment screening; enrollment rate; feasibility of and adherence to the prehabilitation 
program; attrition rate; and extent of missing outcome data. We expect that we will be able to deliver our pr ehabilitation program to ≥50% of patients .  
 Feasibility is defined by [CONTACT_839456], refusal, and adherence to intervention 
components as a whole and individually, potential barriers to adherence, and self -
reported and objective measures of adherence including diaries, wearable sensors, and 
physical pe rformance tests. As secondary outcomes, we will collect clinical outcomes 
(e.g., Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale, surgical complications, and length of stay) and Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures .  
 
3.2 Objective/ Aim 2.  To identify barriers and facilitators of prehabilitation program 
and refine protocol accordingly. After the prehabilitation program, we will interview 
 [ADDRESS_1166579] decreased physiologic reserve to tolerate stressors,5 and thus 
they are more likely to experience poor surgical outcomes, such as complications, 
mortality, readmission, functional decline, and discharge to an institution.6,7 While it is a 
reliable measure of surgical risk, frailty is not part of the preoperative assessment of older adults. Frailty assessment within the context of a comprehensive geriatric assessment —
a multi -domain assessment of medical history, functional status, cognition, mood, 
physical performance, and nutritional status
8—provides not only risk stratification but also 
opportunities to optimize modifiable risk factors to improve surgical outcomes.  
 Optimizing risk factors before surgery may improve outcomes.  Interventions to increase 
reserve through physical activity and nutritional interventions before surgery are biologically plausible ways to improve surgical outcomes, but they are not routinely done 
in practice. To date, studies on prehabilitation have mostly been on gastrointestinal,
9-13 
cardiothoracic,10,14 and orthopedic surgeries15 with physical activity and nutrition as single 
or dual interventions.9-12,14 There are only a small number of RCTs on a multicomponent 
prehabilitation (≥3 interventions).16-[ADDRESS_1166580] shown that prehabilitation may 
decrease length of stay and postoperative complications, and improve f unction, while 
others did not show benefits.9,11,12,14,22,23 Systematic reviews concluded insufficient 
evidence for prehabilitation for clinical use due to significant limitations of studies, 
including small sample sizes,11,13,15,24,25 increased risk of bias (e.g., single- arm studies),9-
11,14,23,[ADDRESS_1166581] of prehabilitation on patient -centered outcomes14 are 
lacking.  
 
 8 The efficacy and potential mechani ”ms o ’ Interventions are supported by [CONTACT_12243] ( Table 
1). Short duration (3- 4 week) intensive exercise and protein- focused nutrition programs 
have also previously been shown to improve physical measures30,31 and outcomes18,19,32-
34; however, a robust RCT of a multi -component prehabilitation program addressing the 
aforementioned gaps is still needed.   
 
Table 1. Evidence and potential mechanisms for multi -component prehabilitation program  
 
 
To accomplish this, we are planning to conduct an RCT of a multi -component 
prehabilitation program versus usual care on patient -centered outcomes in older adults 
undergoing major surgery ( Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1. Conceptual model for an RCT of prehabilitation program. Abbreviation: CGA, comprehensive geriatric 
assessment.  
 
 In this future RCT, we will identif y candidates for prehabilitation based on the patient’s 
frailty level, which represents the physiologic reserve to tolerate stress from surgery and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We will provide a multicomponent intervention which not only addresses the body but also the neurobehavioral aspect of a frail patient, given the link between 
frailty and cognition.
28 We will measure patient -centered outcomes using validated 
Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System  (PROMIS) measures.[ADDRESS_1166582] and refine a multicomponent prehabilitation protocol to ensure its feasibility and 
adherence.  
 

 9 5. STUDY POPULATION  
 
We will review schedules to identify patients who are 1) ≥65 years old; 2) scheduled for 
abdominal, gynecological oncologic, and urologic surgery; and 3) with a comprehensive geriatric assessment -based frailty index (range: 0- 1; greater scores indicate more severe 
frailty) ≥0.25 (mild-to-severe frailty). A trained research assistant will perform preoperative 
geriatric assessment —which consists of 1) medical history (automated in EHR), 2) self -
reported functional status (a questionnaire of 22 daily activities and physical tasks), 3) tests of cognitive function (M oCA test) and physical function (gait speed, chair stands, 
and grip strength), and 4) nutritional status (automated in EHR) —and calculate a frailty 
index using our EHR calculator.  For those with a frailty index of  ≥0.25, we will explain 
this to the patients and their surgeon and ask whether they are willing to participate in up to [ADDRESS_1166583] during the surgeon’s office visit.  The assessment of eligibility will ta ke place by [CONTACT_756].  Our target enrollment is 30 patients (2 patients per week for 
15 weeks).  See the detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria provided below:  
 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria:  
 
• Patient is ≥65 years old 
• Patient is scheduled to have a gastrointestinal, gynecological oncologic, and urologic surgery  
• Patient’s frailty index is ≥0.25  
• Patient provides an informed e- consent or remote consent  
 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria : 
 
• Surgery is scheduled less than 21 days from the expected start date of the 
prehabilitation intervention 
• Patient is considered an inappropriate candidate per the surgeon’s assessment.  
• Non-English speaking  
• Patient has a major cognitive impairment, which will be defined as telephone 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) <18.  
• Patients  with chronic kidney disease stage [ADDRESS_1166584] approval from their 
surgeon to participate will be contact[CONTACT_426] a study clinician who will assess eligibility, 
including a telephone- based preoperative frailty assessment (only patients with frailty will 
be eligible). This assessment includes the following domains:  
 
 10 • Medical history  
• Self-reported functional status (activities of daily living [ADL], instrumental 
activities of daily living [IADL], and physical tasks without another person’s help)  
• Tests of cognitive function (Telephone MoCA)  
• Nutritional status (BMI and self -reported weight loss)  
 
Most of these assessments are already available or routinely collected and entered in BIDMC Online Medical Record (OMR). The study clinician will verify th e existing 
information in OMR with the patient and fill in any missing information if needed. The OMR frailty index calculator calculates the frailty index based on information available in OMR (Figure 2). The index ranges from 0 to 1; frailty is defined as ≥0.25.  
 
Figure 2. Example report of OMR frailty index calculator and assessment report.  The frailty index calculator (A) 
will use the latest information available in OMR to calculate a deficit -accumulation frailty index.  The report shows the 
assessment domain-specific impairment and comparison of the frailty index against a reference population of Medicare 
beneficiaries.  
 
 
6.1 Baseline Assessment  
 Once informed e- consent or remote consent is signed, trained research personnel will 
administer additional  measurements that are not collected as part of preoperative 
assessment. These measurements  (provided below)  may be conducted 1) during the 
telephone call during which informed consent is obtained; 2) during a separate call (if requested by [CONTACT_144911]); 3) email survey; 4) during an in-person physical 

 11 therapy session (for gait speed, chair stands, and handgrip strength); or 5) a combination 
of these modalities.  
 
• Usual walking speed from 4- meter walk (if not already measured)  
• Time to complete 5 chair stands (if not already measured)  
• Dominant handgrip strength: average of 3 measurements (if not already 
measured)  
• 3-day diet recall (done by [CONTACT_756])  
• PROMIS Profile CAT v1.0 is a 29 -item, computer adaptive, patient -reported 
outcome measure of social roles/activities, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain 
interference/intensity, physical function, and sleep disturbance domains (may be done by [CONTACT_19381])  
• PROMIS v2.0 Cognition CAT is a 12- item, computer adaptive, patient -reported 
outcome measure of cognitive function domain (may be done by [CONTACT_756])  
 
PROMIS (available at https://www.healthmeasures.net/index.php) is a publicly available, 
validated system of highly reliable, precise measures of patient -reported health status for 
physical, mental, and social well -being for general population as well as people with 
chronic conditions. It is designed to enhance communications between clinicians and 
patients in diverse clinical and research settings. Computer adaptive test (CAT) allows 
accurate assessment with a limited number of questions from the PROMIS item bank, thereby [CONTACT_839457].

7. STUDY INTERVENTION  
 All participants will be enrolled in a prehabilitation program that will start 3- 4 weeks prior 
to the date of scheduled surgery. The intervention will target three principal components (physical activity, nutrition, and meditation) and deliver cognitive behavioral interventions (Table 3). Each intervention has 1) instructional or training components, delivered by [CONTACT_656767], and 2) self -directed components.

Measurement Information System. * Participants living within a 20 -mile radius from HSL will be offered home in- person, 
center based, or hybrid physical therapy.  
 
7.1 Component 1: Exercise  
 
The instructional part  will be delivered via average twi ce weekly, one- hour, in- person 
home, center -based, or virtual (via HSL’s Zoom video- conferencing software) physical 
therapy sessions, depending on the patient’s preference, familiarity with technology, availability of transportation, and other contingencies (e.g., COVID -19 based restrictions, 
incremental weather). Evidence suggests that virtual sessions offer similar benefits to in-person home sessions
30 or in -clinic sessions.31 Although a twice- weekly schedule is 
aimed, the schedule will be adjusted flexibly to deliver a total of 6- 8 sessions.  
 
 13 Exercises targeting flexibility, strength, and endurance will be adopted mainly, though not 
exclusively, from the NIA Go4Life guide (https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/). Sample exercises are shown in Table 4.  
 Before each in-person or virtual physical therapy session, the study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839447], safety techniques and warning signs (such as chest pain or pressure, severe dyspnea, left shoulder or arm pain, indigestion, heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] s, 
lightheadedness, dizziness, and headache). Participants will begin at a low level of effort and incrementally increase exercise intensity according to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s guidance. For virtual sessions and self -directed exercise, we will ask caregivers, fam ily members, or 
home health personnel to provide supervision for safety and development of adverse events, whenever possible. During the in- person session, blood pressure, heart rate, and 
blood oxygen level will be monitored by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_541].  
 The self-directed part  will include self -directed exercise (any types of exercise) at least 
30 minutes per day for 4 or more days per week. Step count data from a wearable device (Fitbit Fitness Tracker) will monitor progress and provide feedback, which improves adherence in older adults. Fitbit Fitness tracker will either be provided at the pre-admission testing visit or mailed to the patient’s home.

7.2 Component 2: Nutrition  
 
The instructional part  will be delivered in once- weekly (on average), one- hour, virtual 
group sessions (via HSL Zoom software) by [CONTACT_3252]- investigator/registered dietitian, [CONTACT_839467], (the virtual sessions will be offered at three different days/times to accommodate participants’  schedules). This nutrition counseling will focus on optimal 
protein intake (1.2 gram per kg of body weight) for lean body mass preservation (from food sources and oral nutritional supplements). Sessions will focus on nutrition for muscle gain and lean body mass preservation with topi[INVESTIGATOR_20733]:  
 
• Session 1: Good sources of protein and total needs (1.2 grams x weight in kg)  
• Session 2: Protein intake timing: rule 15/30 (at least 15 grams within 30 minutes 
of exercise)  
 14 • Session 3: Protein for muscle gain  
• Session 4: Tips to increase protein intake 
 
The self-directed part  will include consumption of oral nutritional supplements (20- 30 
grams of protein/day and between 150- 350 calories/day, such as Think! High Protein Bar 
(20 grams protein, 22 grams carbohydrate,  150 calories) or Ensure Enlive (20 grams 
protein, 45 grams carbohydrate, 350 calories) , which will be provided by [CONTACT_29452]. Oral nutrition supplements (ONS) will be ordered directly from the product manufacturer in bulk and mailed to the patient’s home by a research assistant.. Due to ongoing supply chain shortages of popular nutrition supplements, we have identified multiple that meet the above macronutrient parameters. All supplements will be purchased in bulk for each participant with enough to l ast the entirety of the study. Supplements will not be changed 
unless the patient reports an adverse event such as GI distress (please see section B5  
for more detailed information).   Protein supplements are shelf -stable and can be stored 
at room temperature until use by [CONTACT_839463]. Once opened, product should be refrigerated within [ADDRESS_1166586] should be discarded within 48 hours –  though patients will be encouraged to consume product in its entirety 
within [ADDRESS_1166587] review (medical history of chr onic kidney disease or 
elevated creatinine value within the last 6 months) and/or lab results obtained before the 
start of the study intervention.

                                                                                                                                                                              
 
7.3 Component 3: Meditation  
 
The instructional part  will be delivered in once- weekly (on average), one- hour, virtual 
group sessions by a meditation teacher, [CONTACT_839468], at BIDMC Sadhguru Center (the virtual sessions will be of fered by [CONTACT_839464]- conferencing at three different 
days/times to accommodate participants’ schedules). Classes will focus on breathing techniques, yoga, and mindful meditation practices.  
 The self-directed part  will include practicing self -directed meditation for a minimum of 12 
minutes daily.  
 
7.4 Component 4: Cognitive Behavioral Interventions  
 A trained co- investigator will have (on average) once weekly 0.5 -hour telephone- based 
sessions with individual patients to  deliver cognitive behavioral strategies to increase 
adherence to the prehabilitation program . These strategies will include:  
 
• Education about frailty and surgery  
• Increase positive beliefs of the benefits of exercise and nutrition  
• Discuss barriers  
 15 • Set individualized goals for surgery and recovery  
• Develop a detailed exercise and nutrition plan (including logistics)  
• Self-monitoring of progress using weekly exercise, diet, and meditation logs  
• Enhance self -efficacy through the celebration of small wins  
 
This co- investigator has  completed the Professional Education Systems Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy Intensive Training Course in preparation for this intervention. This course is designed for health professionals without formal cognitive therapy training.

9. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS 
 
Near the end of the prehabilitation (from the last week of prehabilitation to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]), a trained co- investigator will conduct semi -structured qualitative interviews of 
patients and their caregivers (if they are involved in preoperative care).  
 An interview guide has been developed under qualitative expert consultant guidance. The questions have been  grounded in the Behavioral Change Wheel framework to assess 
factors influencing capability (physical and psychological), opportunity (physical and social), and motivation (reflective and automatic).
[ADDRESS_1166590] hybrid deductive and inductive thematic analysis based on the 3 components (capability, opportunity, and motivation) of the Behavioral Change Wheel framework, while also allowing new insights to emerge from t he data. The 
interviews will be audio -recorded and transcribed verbatim. A coding framework to all 
transcripts will be applied via a collaborative approach through an iterative process. Codes and subsequently derived themes will be refined by [CONTACT_5051].  
 
 [ADDRESS_1166591] adverse event definitions are used:  
• Adverse events: Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of the study intervention, regardless of whether 
it is considered related to the study intervention.  
• Serious adverse event: Any adverse event that result in death, life- threatening 
experience, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266], persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Unanticipated problems: Any experience that 1) is unexpected in terms of nature, 
severity, or frequency, given the research procedures described in the protocol 
document and the characteristics of the study population; 2) is related or possibly related to participation in the research; 3) suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously recognized.  
 Adverse events are graded ac cording to the following scale:  
• Mild: An experience that is transient and requires no special treatment.  The experience does not generally interfere with usual daily activities.  
• Moderate: An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments .  The 
experience impacts usual daily activities.  
• Severe: An experience that requires therapeutic intervention.  The experience interrupts usual daily activities.  If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for treatment, it becomes a severe adverse event.  
 
The study uses the following adverse event attribution scale:  
• Not related: The adverse event is clearly not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of the event is most plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event).  
• Possibly related: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
initiation of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a 
number of other factors.  
• Definitively related: The adverse event is clearly related to the study procedures.  
 
10.2 Adverse Event Monitoring  
 Monitoring adverse events will be primarily performed in two ways: 1) unsolicited report from study interventionists (physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], dietitian, and meditation teacher); and 2) weekly assessments by [CONTACT_5791] a standardized checklist.  
 
• Unsolicited reporting: Any adverse events that occur during the in- person or virtual 
sessions will be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_839465] (in conjunction 
 20 with PI [INVESTIGATOR_839450] -investigator). In the event of a serious adverse event, the 
participant or caregiver will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_839466]. All adverse events will be reported to the PI. 
• Standardized assessment: At the beginning of cognitive behavioral intervention 
telephone calls, co- investigator [CONTACT_839469] will assess adverse events using a 
standardized checklist that includes the following expected adverse events (see 
below).  
 
Expected Adverse Events  
 
• Exercise: fall or injury (expected risk is low); new or worsening musculoskeletal pain 
(expected risk is moderate); cardiovascular events including angina, arrhythmia, 
myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke (expected risk is very low); other symptoms including chest pain, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or syncope (expected risk is low).  
• Nutrition: gastrointestinal distress such as diarrhea, nausea, constipation (expected 
risk is moderate); electrolyte imba lance or dehydration (expected risk is low), renal 
injury from increased renal solute load (expected risk is very low)
38 Meditation: 
psychological distress (expected risk is very low/rare)39 
• Outcome measurement: possibility of incidental finding (such as s uicidal ideation) 
through the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System  
(PROMIS) surveys (expected risk is very low)  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1166592] will not be formed; instead, a safety officer will oversee and review adverse events during the study period. Please see below regarding t he roles of the 
safety officer.  
 
Frequency of Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
Study data are accessible at all times for PI [INVESTIGATOR_44293]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_839451] (bi- weekly once the study procedures are established), including the number 
of potential patients screened and provided informed consent, the number of drop- outs, 
protocol deviations, and adverse events. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_839452] -
time and consult each other when needed for determination of the relatedness  to the study 
interventions. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_839453], adverse events, serious 
 21 adverse events, and unanticipated problems are reported to IRB. Serious adverse events 
and unanticipated problems that are definitively related to the study interventions will be reported to IRB within 48 hours from when we learn about the event.  
 Content of Data and Safety Monitoring Report  
 The content of the data and safety monitoring report will include accrual, baseline characteristics, efficacy data on primary and secondary outcomes, and adverse events.  
 
DSMB/Safety Officer  
 
A formal Data Safety Monitoring Board will not be established for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; however, a physician not directly involved in the study has been identified to fill the safety officer role: [CONTACT_77107] D. Berry, a geriatrician and clinical investigator at HSL Marcus Institute and Associate Professor of Medicine, HMS.  
 
Conflict of Interest of DSMB/Safety Officer  
 
The safety officer will have no direct involvement with the study inv estigators or 
intervention.  The safety officer will sign a conflict -of-interest statement which includes 
current affiliations, if any, with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and any other relationship that could be perceived as a conflict of int erest related to the study 
and/or associated with commercial interests pertinent to the study objectives.  
 
DSMB/Safety Officer Responsibility  
 
• Assess the research protocol, informed consent documents, and plans for data 
safety and monitoring  
• Recommend init iation of subject recruitment after review of the protocol  
• Evaluate trial progress quarterly, including recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, and other factors that can affect study outcomes  
• Consider factors external to the s tudy when relevant, such as scientific or 
therapeutic developments that may impact the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial  
• Provide recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems reported by [CONTACT_978]  
• Protect the safety of the study  participants  
• Provide recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_234670], termination, or other study modifications based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study  
• Ensure the confidentiality of study data and monitoring resul ts 
 
11. ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
 22 11.1 Statistical Analysis for Feasibility  
 
We will estimate the feasibility of the entire prehabilitation program and each component; mean time for preoperative geriatric assessment; proportion of participants who enroll in the prehabilitation program; proportion of participants who drop out; and rate of missing 
outcome data.  No statistical testing will be performed.  
 Sample Size Justification:  We anticipate that the 3 core components of our prehabilitation 
program would be completed for 70% of the eligible patients
9-15 (feasibility of ≥50% would 
be needed for a large RCT). Assuming a 20% margin of error and a lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of 0.50, we will need 30 patients.  
 
11.2 Statistical Analysis for Qualitative Research  
 There is no statistical analysis for qualitative research.  
 Sample Size Justification: In most qualitative studies, interviews of 16- 24 participants are 
needed to achieve thematic saturation of data.
40 Our target enrollment of 30 patients (2 
patients per week for 15 weeks), ensures we meet that threshold, and our sample size is sufficient to reach thematic saturation to fully understand the “meaning” of the data.  
 
12. HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTION AND PROTECTION OF 
CONFIDENTIALTY 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1166593] risk of physical harm, such as musculoskeletal pain, falls, cardiovascular or pulmonary events from low -intensity 
exercise; diarrhea, nausea, constipation, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, or renal injury due to hyperosmolar content of some oral nutrition supplement formulations (Ensure Enlive). There is potential risk for increased anxiety or psychological distress from meditation. Lastly, while none of the PROMIS questions specifically ask about suicide, some of the possible questions through the computer -adaptive test may indicate 
that the patient is at risk. As such, there is potential risk to uncover suicidal ideation in patients. Loss of confidentiality is another potential risk. We do not anticipate any financial or legal risks.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1166594] will adapt the exercise program according to the participant’s physical capacity, their level of confidence, and the home environment. Prior to participation in exercise, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839454]. Participants will be taught safe exercise techniques. To minimize gastrointestinal (GI) distress, only participants with clinically significant weight loss (>5% 
 23 x 1 month; >7.5 x 3 months; 10% x 6 months; 20% x 1 year)or who have a history of 
taking calorically -dense supplements without issue (confirmed by [CONTACT_4676]) will be provided 
the hyperosmolar protein supplemental shake (Ensure). All other participants will be 
provided with a high protein bar or powder (for patients with swallowing or chewing 
difficulty, powder can be mixed with a solid puree). Those receiving the shake will be instructed to consume no more than one high calorie, high protein supplement per day and to drink adequate fluids before and after taking supplement. In the event of gastrointestinal distress (nausea, diarrhea or constipation), patient will be instructed to consume supplement in divided doses (no more than 50% in one sitting) or to dilute formula 1:1 with water. If gastrointestinal distress continues, patient will be switched to the protein bar or powder. Due to the lower calorie  content, those participants may be instructed to consume an additional high- calorie snack, if needed. . In the event that an 
incidental finding such as depression or suicid al ideation (SI), a specific protocol is 
outlined below in Figure 3 to ensure patient safety:  
 
Figure 3  - Incidental Finding: Depression and suicidal risk  
 
 
In the case of adverse events, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839455] 
a study physician (for any adverse events) and emergency medical services (for serious adverse events). These procedures will prevent or mitigate the consequences of adverse events.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1166595] of care, frail patients continue to experience complications such as mortality, 

 24 readmission, functional decline, and discharge to an institution. The potential benefits to 
study participants include receiving our study intervention, which target s major risk factors 
that are modifiable yet rarely addressed in the preoperative period (physical function, nutrition, pain, sleep, anxiety, and cognition), at no cost. These interventions address 4 of the 8 target areas identified by [CONTACT_339086] “Strong for Surgery” 
quality initiative to improve surgical outcomes. Moreover, each component of the intervention was studied to have some level of benefit based on biological plausibility and clinical findings. It is thus reasonably expected that the intervention will provide some 
benefits to the participants that are more likely to outweigh the modest risk of physical harms from exercise.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1166596] if all of the progression c riteria  are met: 1) enrollment (we can 
enroll ≥1.5 patients per week); 2) feasibility  (we can deliver an adequate dose of the core 
interventions to ≥50% of participants); 3) adherence (≥50% of participants adhere to the core 
interventions: ≥4 days with 30 minutes of exercise per week, ≥4 days with protein intake per week, 
and ≥4 days with 12 minutes of meditation per week); 4) follow -up (≥65% of surviving participants 
can complete PROM IS assessment on postoperative day 90). If these are not met, we will use 
information from qualitative interview to revise our study interventions before proceeding to an 
RCT. We will submit an NIH R01 application in 18 months.

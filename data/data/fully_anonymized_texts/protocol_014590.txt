[CONTACT_1744]-[ADDRESS_132882] Title:Role of angiotensin II and inflammation in persistent vessel dysfunction following preeclampsia
I.3 Short Title (optional):ang II and inflammation following preeclampsia
I.[ADDRESS_132883] had preeclampsia. Identification of thesemechanisms may lead to better clinical management of cardiovascular disease risk in these women. 
In this study we use the blood vessels in the skin as a representative vascular bed. Using a minimally invasive technique
(intradermal microdialysis for the local delivery of pharmaceutical agents) we examine the blood vessels in a nickle-sized areaof the skin and compare the responses of the blood vessels in women who have had preeclampsia to those of our controlgroup, women who have had an uncomplicated pregnancy. We make these measurements after the subjects take a placeboand after they take an anti-inflammatory medication (salsalate) to test the role of inflammation in the differences we seebetween groups. As a compliment to these measurements, we also draw blood from the subjects and isolate the inflammatorycells to test how sensitive their inflammatory responses are.
I.5 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol")Specific Aim: To define the mechanistic role of Angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling in microvascular inflammation and associatedendothelial dysfunction in women who have had preeclampsia (PreEC) compared to control women who have had a healthypregnancy (HC). Using intradermal microdialysis for the in vivo assessment of microvascular signaling mechanisms, we will test the hypothesesthat PreEC have (1) increased constrictor sensitivity to Ang II and (2) reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation, both ofwhich will be normalized post-systemic inhibition of inflammation. We will also utilize peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) collected pre and post-salsalate treatment to test the hypothesis that (3) immune cells from PreEC have a greaterinflammatory response to stimulation with Ang II. 
NOTE: This IRB protocol encompasses the projects of aim 1 in the attached NIH K99/R00 award. Aim 2 has been completed
and aim 3 will be included in a separate IRB application to come later. 
I.6 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project.(do not indicate "see protocol")Angiotensin II Sensitivity Contributes to Endothelial Dysfunction Following Preeclampsia: Women with a history of preeclampsiahave an exaggerated presser response to systemic infusion of Ang II. Similarly, compelling in vivo pi[INVESTIGATOR_119142]. Ang II mediates several events of the inflammatory processincluding activation of the vascular endothelium; and AT1R activation plays a large role in the pathophysiology of concurrentinflammatory reactions through this direct action on local vascular cells. Inhibition of Ang II, either through ACE inhibition orAT1-receptor antagonism, reduces tissues inflammation and oxidative injury. Reciprocally, inhibition of inflammatory mediatorssuch as IL-[ADDRESS_132884] elevated circulating Ang II. However, evidence suggests that
activating AT1R autoantibodies (AT1-AAs) develop in women during a preeclamptic pregnancy and remain elevated post-partum. AT1-AAs contribute to the vascular pathology of preeclampsia in animal models, and isolated AT1-AAs induce a dose-dependent vasoconstriction response and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, these responses aremediated through AT1R binding at the cell membrane, and are inhibited by [CONTACT_50182]1R blockade. Chronically elevated AT1-AAs post-partum likely contribute to persistent inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in women who have had preeclampsia,independent of endogenous Ang II concentrations. As such, this unique mechanism highlights the relevance of theinflammatory pathway and AT1R sensitivity, as well as the therapeutic potential of physiological (Ang 1-7) and pharmacological(salsalate) inhibitors of AT1R signaling and/or inflammation, in the vascular dysfunction that persists post-partum in women

Angiotensin 1-7 is an Endogenous Inhibitor of Ang II: Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), a protective component of the renin-
angiotensin system, acts on its receptor, mas, to oppose the intracellular actions of Ang II-AT1R signaling. Ang 1-7 – masreceptor binding produces vasodilation, inhibits cell growth, and has anti-inflammatory15, [ADDRESS_132885] in conditions of endothelial dysfunction,including diabetes and essential hypertension. Given the role of increased AT1R signaling – through increased Ang II sensitivityand elevated plasma AT1-AA – in persistent vascular dysfunction post-partum, the actions of Ang 1-[ADDRESS_132886] – aberrant Ang II signaling and chronic inflammation in the microvasculature of women
who have had preeclampsia – is innovative in its delineation of novel mechanisms and interventional targets in an in vivohuman microvascular bed. The proposed series of studies utilize state-of-the-art techniques to pharmaco-dissect thedeleterious role of Ang II signaling as well as the potentially protective role of Ang 1-7 signaling, in chronic inflammation andendothelial dysfunction in vivo in the human cutaneous microvasculature. Coupled with innovative in vitro measures of immunecell activity and acute systemic inhibition of inflammation, these studies will provide new insight into novel mechanistic targetsfor intervention.

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_119148]. After the participant signs the
informed consent, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_119149], heart rate (HR), bloodpressure (BP), height, waist circumference, and weight measurements. The participant fills out the health history questionnaire. Aresearch nurse performs a standard venipuncture to obtain blood (total = 7.5ml blood) for complete blood count (CBC), chemistryanalysis, and lipid profile to be measured at UIHC pathology labs. 
Visits 2 and 4- Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119150] (approximately 15 minutes)
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_119151] (salsalate or placebo). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_119152], potential side effects,and who to call if they have questions or problems while taking the medication. 
Visits 3 and 5 - Experimental visits (approximately 4 hours each)
 
Note: prior to coming to the Field House for the experimental visits, subjects take the oral study medication for [ADDRESS_132931] 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_119153] 1, 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_119154] 2,3, and 4, and 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_119155] 5, thesame day as the experimental visit (see drug info and schedule handouts). After the first study visit, subjects will undergo a washoutperiod of at least [ADDRESS_132932] any study medication, before beginning the same 5 day regimen of the othertreatment. 
Experimental procedures
 
Subjects will come to the CRU where a research nurse performs a blood draw (14.5 ml, < 1 Tablespoon) for substances of interest
(e.g. inflammatory cytokines) and immune cell activity, salsalate level, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. Then the the subject willbe escorted by a member of the research team to [ADDRESS_132933] in 528 Field House. Please see the attached "intradermal microdialysis"
document for general information about intradermal microdialysis, schematic representation of the procedure, and references.
 
Microdialysis Probe Insertion: The researchers place a tight band around the forearm so they can visualize veins. For each MD site,they make pairs of pen-marks on the arm 2.5 cm (1 inch) apart and away from veins. They remove the tight band. The MD tubing
enters and exits the skin at the marks. The researchers clean the arm with povidone iodine and alcohol, and place an ice bag on thesite for 5 minutes to numb the skin. Then they insert a thin needle into the skin at each entry mark. The needle’s tip travels betweenthe layers of skin for 2.5 cm (1 inch) and exits the skin at the matching exit-mark. They thread the microdialysis tubing through the
needle and then withdraw the needle leaving the tubing in the skin. Any hyperemia related to the insertion subsides in about 60minutes. When the hyperemia induced by [CONTACT_119180], the experiment begins.During this time LactatedRinger’s perfuses the tubing. The researchers tape a fiber optic laser Doppler flowmeter probe and its holder over each microdialysissite. The researchers control the temperature of the holders. The holders start at 33°C (91.4°F). During the experiment, thecomputerized data acquisition system records heart rate, sublingual temperature, skin blood flow, and skin temperaturescontinuously. The researcher and/or an automated critical care monitor measures blood pressure at 5-7 minute intervals.
 
Acetylcholine and Angiotensin II Dose Responses: The intradermal microdialysis probes are randomly numbered 1 - 3 and assignedto receive doses of acetylcholine with or without L-NAME (probes 1 and 2) or angiotensin II (probe 3). Acetylcholine Dose Response:
 Microdialysis Probe 1. Lactated Ringer’s only  
Microdialysis Probe 2. Lactated Ringer’s + L-NAME  
[CONTACT_119192]:  Microdialysis Probe 3. Lactated Ringer’s only  
When the skin blood flow is stable, the researchers perform a 10-minute baseline set of measurements. The researchers add identical
concentrations of acetylcholine to the perfusate in probes [ADDRESS_132934] concentrations, theresearchers warm the temperature controllers to 43°C (108°F) and switch perfusates at all sites to lactated Ringer’s for about 30minutes. After [ADDRESS_132935] may be given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_119156] 2(replacing visit 4), along withinstructions for when and how to take the pi[INVESTIGATOR_119157] 5.

VIII. Risks
VIII.1 What are the risks to subjects including- emotional or psychological- financial- legal or social- physical?Physical Risks:
 
Microdialysis: Intradermal microdialysis is a specialized research technique. [CONTACT_119193] is highly skilled in this technique and hasbeen using the procedures in this protocol(including fiber placement, perfusate preparation, subject monitoring, and fiber removal)for over 10 years with no adverse events (see letter of support from [CONTACT_119194])and have been reviewed and approved by[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Diana Jalal at the University of Iowa. Similar procedures for the use of intradermal microdialysis are used in other peerinstitutions around the country (see letter's of support from [CONTACT_119195], [CONTACT_119196], and [CONTACT_119197]) withoutregular adverse events. 
Cutaneous microdialysis commonly causes some pain and bruising similar to that experienced during venipuncture. There is usually
no pain after the probe is in place. The participant may experience mild pain while the researchers remove probe. Minor bleeding
may occur. As with any event that breaks the skin, infection is possible. However, no participants in any of the researchers’ prior
experiments have reported infection. In the unlikely event in which the membrane breaks during removal leaving an isolated pi[INVESTIGATOR_119158], they treat the pi[INVESTIGATOR_119159] a manner similar to that for a splinter in the skin. In this case,
trained personnel make a superficial incision for removal. Such an event has never occurred in any projects overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124].Stanhewicz. 
Microdialysis delivers small amounts of pharmacological substances to a nickel-sized area of the skin. The small quantities used and
the extremely localized administration during microdialysis does not produce systemic effects. To the researchers’ knowledge, there
are no reports of long or short-term side effects of these substances administered through microdialysis. The chance of adverse
reactions to these substances is extremely small given the minute amount delivered to the a very small area of skin, the lack ofadverse reactions to similar amounts delivered via MD in many other studies, and lack of adverse effects in human cell cultures.There is a slight chance of allergic reaction to these substances that could produce redness, itching, rash, and/or swelling. 
Local Heating: The local heating control unit (Moor Instruments) precisely controls and monitors the temperature of the heated probe
holders used with the Laser Doppler Flowmeter. The system has programmed maximum temperature limits. To determine themaximal SkBF, the researchers increase the temperature of the heating units slowly (about 0.1°C every 1 second). The skin feels
very warm but not painful. Local heating causes temporary redness of the skin that subsides within several hours. This technique is
very unlikely to produce long-term ill effects.

An allergic reaction could cause redness, itching, rash, and/or swelling. Staff use only alcohol on participants with iodine allergy as
identified during screening.  
Tape and adhesive disks: Participants could be sensitive to the adhesive of the tape, ECG electrodes, and double-sided adhesive disksused in the study causing redness, rash, tenderness, and/or itching. The researchers remove these items carefully. 
Blood draws: Potential risks associated with obtaining blood samples are minimal but include slight bruising, pain, a temporaryfeeling of faintness, and/or a small risk of infection. All blood draws will be performed by a research nurse or team member trained indrawing blood. 
Salsalate: Salsalate is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in a group of drugs called salicylates. This medicine is used
clinically to reduce the pain, swelling, and joint stiffness caused by [CONTACT_119181]. 
The most common side effects from the Salsalate medication include (in order of decreasing frequency) tinnitus ('rininging in the
ears'), nausea, mild hearing impairment, rash, and vertigo in two studies with combined 280 subjects (percentages not available).Another study of 782 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis were treated with about 3000 mg/day for 3 weeks, 324(41%) experience one or more side effects with 234 (30%) requiring discontinuation of Salsalate for GI side effects (13.2%), tinnitus(6.7%), dizziness (1.7%) and 8.5% for other reasons. 
Metabolic acidosis: There is a very small risk of metabolic acidosis from salicylate toxicity although no clinical trials above reported
any incidence of this. This usually can be treated by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_119161]. 
Heart attack or stroke: Because Salsalate is an NSAID, people who take NSAIDs (other than aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) may have a higher risk of having
a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. These events may happen without warning and may causedeath. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time and in those who have cardiovascular disease. There is noreported increased risk of heart attack or stroke in individuals on Salsalate so it cannot be determined what the exact risk (if any) isfor Salsalate at the dose and duration in this study. Subjects are instructed to get emergency medical help right away if theyexperience any of the following symptoms during the study: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of thebody, or slurred speech. 
Gastrointestinal bleeding: NSAIDs such as salsalate may cause ulcers, bleeding, or holes in the stomach or intestine. These problems
may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higherfor people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, smoke, or drink large amounts of alcohol or are onthe following medications: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]; other NSAIDS such as ibuprofen(Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); or oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone(Medrol), and prednisone (Deltasone). All of these medication are exclusion criteria in our study. Subjects are instructed to stoptaking salsalate and call the study doctor if they experience any of the following during the study: severe stomach pain or heartburn,vomiting a substance that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools. Because of this risk weexclude for bleeding disorders and history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
 
Allergic reaction: Subjects could have a mild or severe allergic reaction including hives; difficult breathing; swelling of the face, lips,tongue, or throat. We exclude subjects who have a known allergy to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_119162].
 
Emotional or Psychological risks: There are no foreseeable psychological risks with this study. 
Social Risks: There are no foreseeable social risks with this study Legal Risks: There are no foreseeable legal risks with this study. Loss of confidentiality is possible.

If applicable to this study ALSO include:
How you (members of your research team at Iowa) will monitor the safety of individual subjects.
Include a description of the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might require as
a consequence of participating in this research and how referral will occur if necessary (e.g. availability ofemergency medical care, psychological counseling, etc.)
Note: All investigational substances used in these protocols are used with general Physician Oversight (see attached StandardOperating Procedures document)
 
Risks Associated with Salsalate Treatment:  
During the study if a subject experiences side effects that are life threatening, the subject will be instructed to call 911. If the subjectexperiences any mild but tolerable expected side effects such as tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, headache, they will be asked to keep alog of these including the date, the duration, and the severity by [CONTACT_119182] a scale of 1 (mild) to 10 (severe/intolerable). If thesubject feels the side effects are uncomfortable or intolerable, then they will be instructed to call the Research Nurse or Dr.Stanhewicz. The Research Nurse or [CONTACT_119193] (although she will be blinded) will instruct the subject to skip the next dose and ifthe symptoms/side effects have resolved at time of next dose (in 12 hours), they will be instructed to take the next dose. Dr.Stanhewicz will consult with [CONTACT_119198] if necessary. If symptoms do not resolve or worsen at time of next scheduled dose, the subjectwill be instructed to not take that dose, and to come to the CRU to have a blood sample to assess serum salicylate concentrations.The subject will be withdrawn from the study procedures but will be followed up as necesary. If serum salicylate concentrations arenot in the toxic range (<30 mg/dl), the subject will be re-assessed in 12 hours to confirm that symptoms resolved. If blood plasmasalicylate concentrations are in the toxic range (>30 mg/dl), participants will return to the CRU in [ADDRESS_132940]. Jalal will benotified and determine appropriate medical management in the CRU or referral to the UIHC Emergency Department.

IX. Benefits
IX.[ADDRESS_132945] (do not include compensation or hypothesized results)?The study procedures and/or findings do not provide direct benefits to the subjects participating in the study. Subjects receive amedical screening that could inform them about their health. They learn their blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. This is
important knowledge. High blood pressure and blood cholesterol contribute to many serious health problems. We advise those withhigh blood pressure or blood cholesterol to follow-up with a health care provider. They also learn of the connection between
preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease.

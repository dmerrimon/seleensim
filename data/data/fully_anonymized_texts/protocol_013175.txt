[CONTACT_67005] and [CONTACT_17261] G. Hudetz 
 
General Goal The overarching aim of this study is to investigate the impact of transcranial low-intensity 
focused ultrasound pulsation (LIFUP) on conscious perception. Our central hypothesis is that specific subcortical brain areas play pi[INVESTIGATOR_66976], and by [CONTACT_66988], we can uncover their distinct contributions. To test this hypothesis, we will employ both psychological assessment and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques. In particular, we will evaluate perceptual outcomes using a near-threshold perceptual task, employing Signal Detection Theory (SDT) metrics. Concurrently, we will utilize LIFUP to stimulate select subcortical brain regions and assess their causal influence during conscious perception. 
This research serves two critical purposes. First, it contributes to our understanding of the 
neural underpi[INVESTIGATOR_66977]—a fundamental and unresolved issue in neuroscience. Second, from a clinical perspective, the findings hold promise for potential applications of LIFUP in medical settings, such as facilitating the recovery of consciousness during the emergence from anesthesia. 
Introduction The neural mechanisms underlying conscious perception have long intrigued the field of 
neuroscience 
1–16. While extensive research has focused on the cortical aspects of 
conscious perception 6,7,15, the role played by [CONTACT_66989]. Among various important subcortical sites, such as brainstem and basal forebrain nuclei 
17, the thalamus stands out as a critical structure due to its 
extensive bidirectional connections and interactions with the cerebral cortex 18,19.  
Within the thalamus, two major cell classes exist, known as "core" and "matrix" cells 20,21. 
These cells project differently to the cortex. The human thalamus can be coarsely divided based on the prevalence of these two cell types ( Figure 1 ). Core cells are preferentially 
distributed in the posterior thalamic areas, while matrix cells are more abundant in the anterior regions 
22. Core cells primarily innervate the granular layers of the cerebral 
cortex, sending axonal projections to Layers III and IV of sensory cortices in a retinotopic, tonotopic, and somatotopic manner. In contrast, matrix cells innervate the supragranular cortex in a relatively diffuse manner, indicating a preference for interactions with higher-order cortical areas 
22. Understanding the distinct roles of these thalamic cell classes 
could significantly contribute to unraveling the mysteries surrounding conscious perception. 
 
Figure 1.  The distribution of two distinct sub-populati ons of thalamic projection cells (core and 
matrix). The cell types were identified based on mRNA expression levels of two calcium-binding proteins, Calbindin (CALB1) and Parvalbumin (PVALB), as provided by [CONTACT_66990] 
23. The relative weighting of the CALB1 and PVALB level differences was measured using 
the CP T metric 22, where blueish values indicate regions with higher CALB1 levels (matrix-rich), 
and greenish values indicate areas with higher PVALB levels (core-rich). The thalamus is coarsely 
divided into four sections: ventral anterior (VA), dorsal anterior (DA), ventral posterior (VP), and 
dorsal posterior (DP). 
To investigate the functional role of thalamic areas in conscious perception, it becomes 
imperative to causally alter their activity. Traditional brain stimulation methods either involve invasive procedures or have low target resolution. For instance, deep-brain stimulation involves surgically implanted electrodes whereas transcranial magnetic stimulation suffers from low spatial resolution. Optogenetic approaches offer unparalleled precision but require genetic manipulation, making them unsuitable for use in humans. 
The novel method of transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation (LIFUP) as 
an attractive alternative that overcomes t hese limitations. LIFUP has the unique ability to 
non-invasively target deep brain nuclei, including specific thalamic areas, with remarkable precision of sonication focus 
24. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_66978]-induced 
behavioral modifications 25, its effect on conscious perception remains largely unexplored. 
Employing LIFUP to noninvasively modulate the activity of select brain regions has the potential to shed light on the intricate neural mechanisms of conscious perception in humans.  
Research Objectives The primary objective of this study is to investigate the causal role of thalamic areas in 
conscious perception using LIFUP. We hypothesize that stimulating different thalamic regions by [CONTACT_66991], potentially affecting 
subjective perception as quantified by [CONTACT_66992]. 
To test these hypotheses, we have devised a three-fold approach: 
1. We will conduct a near-threshold perceptual task to assess the perceptual 
outcomes under different conditions. 

2. Utilizing transcranial LIFUP, we will selectively stimulate (both excite and inhibit) 
the anterior and posterior thalamic areas. These areas are chosen because they are known to be differentially enriched by [CONTACT_66993], respectively. 
3. We will evaluate the quality of consciou s contents using two orthogonal quantities 
derived from Signal Detection Theory: criterion (c) and sensitivity (d'). Criterion (c) represents a subject's tendency to report subjective recognition of a target stimulus, irrespective of its presence or absence. On the other hand, sensitivity (d') measures a subject's ability to differentiate  between trials with a target present and 
trials with a target absent ( Figure 2 ). 
 
Figure [ADDRESS_73204] that exciting the matrix cell-rich areas of the thalamus, such as the ventral 
anterior section, will lead to a decrease in criterion (c), indicating a shift of the decision criterion towards a more liberal response bias. Conversely, exciting the core cell-rich areas of the thalamus, like the dorsal posteri or section, will increase sensitivity (d'), 
resulting in improved differentiation ability in  stimulus perception. Conversely, we also 
anticipate that inhibiting the ventral anteri or thalamus will have the opposite effect on 
criterion (c), leading to a more conservative decision bias. Inhibiting the dorsal posterior thalamus will reduce sensitivity (d'), resulti ng in a decreased ability to differentiate 
between stimuli. By [CONTACT_66994], we aim to unravel the distinct causal roles of the anterior and posterior t halamus in conscious perceptio n. This disentanglement will 
provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of specific thalamic regions in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_66979]. 
Number of Subjects, Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Our study will involve the enrollment of [ADDRESS_73205] of questionnaires rela ted to medical history, demographic 
information, handedness, inclusion and exclusion criteria. If interested, the participant will 

complete the questionnaires, which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_3476]. Once eligibility is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3476], the one-time research study session will be scheduled.  Participants may be screened for COVID-19 prior to entry into the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66980].  
 
Figure 3.  Randomized study group assignment. A total of 60 participants will be enrolled in the 
study and randomly assigned to two groups, each comprising 30 participants. The group 
assignment will be based on the type of transcranial LIFUP they will receive, either in the form of 
excitation or inhibition. 
All participants will give written informed consent according to institutional guidelines prior 
to any testing. The Principal Investigators or their designee will obtain consent using a written consent form approved by [CONTACT_66995] (IRBMED). It will c ontain detailed information regarding the

Methods and Procedures LIFUP Method. The mechanism of action of LIFUP have been associated with 
mechanically induced changes in membrane capacitance, cavitation events, and 
mechanical sensitivity of voltage-gated ion channels 26–28. A neuronal intramembrane 
cavitation excitation model 29,30, which accounts for differential effects as a function of 
cell-type, emerged as an explanation for the stimulus parameter-dependent range of excitatory vs. inhibitory effe cts. In this model, the LIFUP parameter duty cycle (DC) likely 
determines excitation (higher DC, allowing for longer sonication-on periods) and inhibition (lower DC, allowing for short ultrasonic bursts with longer periods between bursts) independent of the other sonication parameters. Excitation occurs optimally at a high duty cycle of 70%, allowing for a trade-off in regu lar-spi[INVESTIGATOR_66982]-s pi[INVESTIGATOR_66983] 
25. In contrast, a low duty cycle (e.g., DC < 10%) produces a suppressive effect 
31–39. Thus, LIFUP can bidirectionally modulate the circuitry of interest depending on the 
choice of duty cycle.  
We will utilize the BrainSonix BXPulsar 1002 LIFUP System (BrainSonix Inc. 
http://www.brainsonix.com/). FDA has determined that our proposed clinical investigation is a nonsignificant risk (NSR) device study because it does not meet the definition of a significant risk (SR) device under 21 CFR 812.3(m) of the investigational device exemptions (IDE) regulation (21 CFR 812). An IDE application is not required to be submitted to, or approved by, FDA for a NSR study. This device contains a single-element, air-backed, spherical section ultrasound transducer with 61 mm diameter and 80 mm focal depth. The transducer is mounted in a plastic housing filled with deionized, de-gassed water and sealed with a thin polyethylene membrane permeable to ultrasound. The transducer will be coupled to the scalp of the participant using a 3D-printed transducer holder that allows for sonication to occur in conjunction with ultrasonic standoff pads and ultrasound gel. The LIFUP system operates at a fundamental frequency of 650 kHz. Following previous work, we plan to administer a pulse repetition frequency of 10 Hz, pulse width of 0.5 ms, and a duty cycle of 70% to induce an excitatory effect and a duty cycle of 5% to induce a suppressive effect. For each thalamic area, a total of 10 sonications (in 10 minutes) will be administe red, with a derated sp atial-peak temporal-
average intensity (Ispta) of 720 mW/cm
2, each lasting 30 s, separated by 30 s pause 
intervals ( Figure 4 ). We will utilize the Brainsight Navigation system, developed by 
[CONTACT_66996], to ensure precise targeting and positioning of the transducer. At the target location, the estimated peak pressure will be 0.71 MPa, and the ultrasound beam width 
will be 5 mm. The estimated targeting accuracy (uncertainty) at the desired location is ±2.5 mm. Electromyography (EMG) recordi ngs will complement the behavioral data, 
providing valuable information about muscle activity and response patterns during the 
study.

and https://brainsonix.com/technology/).  
Experimental Design. The experimental will consist of a 10-minute baseline period 
(LIFUP-OFF) followed by [CONTACT_66997] 10-minute sessions of stimulating (LIFUP-ON) four 
thalamic areas. The order of  thalamic area stimulation will be counterbalanced across 
participants and will include the ventral anteri or (VA), dorsal ante rior (DA), ventral 
posterior (VP), and dorsal posterior (DP) sections of the thalamus. The center coordinates of these thalamic regions will be derived from a previous study on thalamic parcellation 
40. Given that previous studies have not indicated any functional lateralization of the 
thalamic areas, we will target only the left hemisphere for the sake of convenience in this study.  
Perceptual Task. The quality of conscious perception will be assessed by a well-
established psychometric approach, t he near-threshold perceptual task 41,42. This task 
allows one to compare the neural activity evoked by [CONTACT_66998] ( Figure 5 ). It thus rules out 
potential confounds of variability derived from the differences in physical property of the stimuli. All stimuli will be programmed using E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA) and delivered via a laptop computer. Stimuli will be presented at the threshold of subjective recognition. An adaptive thresholding procedure will be conducted whereby [CONTACT_66999] a 50% subjective recognition rate for each subject. Stimuli will include two common visual  object categories: faces and houses. 
Participants’ task is to report the category (“F” or “H”) of an image presented and their recognition experience (“Yes” or “No”). Specif ically, they will be instructed to report the 
object category regardless of their recognition experience and, in cases of unrecognized images, to make a genuine guess (two-alternati ve choice discrimination). Then, they will 
be instructed to report whether they see an object, such that even if the object appears unclear or noisy, they should respond “yes”, but if they see nothing or only low-level features, they should respond “no”.  

 
Figure 5.  Visual task design. During each 10-min session, participants will complete an image 
recognition task. Stimuli (faces, houses, and scrambled images) will be presented at the threshold 
of subjective recognition. Participants’ task is to report the category (“F” or “H”) of the image 
presented and their recognition experience (“Yes” or “No”). 
The stimulus set will include real and scra mbled images, the latter will be created by 
[CONTACT_16303]-shuffling of a randomly chosen real image from each category to preserve category specific low-level image features 
41,42. Because scrambled images serve as “catch trials” 
to determine the subjects’ baseline tendency to give positive responses to a question about their recognition experience. The pr e-stimulus interval will va ry randomly from trial 
to trial between [ADDRESS_73208] imulus timing predictability. The stimuli will 
be presented in a randomized order to prevent category predictability. 
Primary Outcome Measure Perceptual criterion (c) and sensitivity (d’) derived from the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) 
analysis. These measures will be assessed over a timeframe spanning from the baseline 
to 60 minutes after the LIFUP stimulation.  
Data Analysis and Statistics For each 10-min session, we will calculate sensit ivity (d’) and criterion (c) using subjective 
reports of recognition as “yes ” or ”no”. (d’) indicates the ability to discriminate between 
real and scrambled images. It is computed by [CONTACT_67000] z-transformed False Alarms Rate (FAR) from the z-transformed Hit Rate (HR): d’ = Z(HR) - Z(FAR)), where Z is an inverse normal cumulative distribution function. (c) reflects the tendency to make “yes” reports to indicate recognition, regardless of whether the stimulus is a real or a scrambled image, which is computed as: c = -0.5 x (Z (HR)+Z(FAR)). We will also calculate percent 
of correct responses as an operational measure of two alternative-forced-choice sensitivity using subjective category reports, i.e., responses to the first question: “Face” or “House”.  
We will conduct a repeated-measures ANOVA, considering measurements taken during 
both the baseline and the four thalamic areas' stimulation sessions. This analysis will be 

performed at the group level to assess the effects of LIFUP on the perceptual measures. 
To determine statistical significance, we will apply a false discovery rate (FDR) correction

differences between the baseline and the different thalamic area stimulations in terms of sensitivity (d') and criterion (c). 
Anticipated Results and Interpretation We expect to observe differential changes in the perceptual outcomes based on the 
LIFUP stimulation of different thalamic areas. We anticipate that stimulation of the ventral anterior thalamus will decrease criterion (c), indi cating a shift of the decision criterion in 
the liberal direction. During exciting the dorsal posterior thalamus, we expect an increase in sensitivity (d'), reflecting a higher sensitivity in differentiating between stimuli. Conversely, when inhibiting the ventral anterior thalamus and the dorsal posterior thalamus, we expect the opposite effects on criterion (c) and sensitivity (d') compared to the outcomes seen during their respective excitations. The effects of stimulating the dorsal anterior thalamus and the ventral posterior thalamus are expected to lie between the effects of ventral anterior and dorsal posterior thalamic stimulation. These findings should provide valuable insights into the specific contributions of these thalamic regions in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_66984]. 
 Power Analysis  
We considered a recent review article that summarized [ADDRESS_73209] conclusions 
about the neuromodulatory effects of LIFUP on conscious perception. 
Biological Variables Our participant recruitment will be inclusive, encompassing individuals of all sexes and 
diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds, with the goal of achieving equal representation and promoting diversity. However, to minimize age-dependent variation in LIFUP effects, the age range of participants will be restricted to 18-[ADDRESS_73210] reported no adverse events or 
evidence of anatomical damage 35,45–50. Mild and moderate symptoms have been 
occasionally reported, such as neck pain, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], muscle twitches, itchiness, and headaches 
51. However, a comprehensive safety survey focusing on ultrasound for 
human neuromodulation found no evidence of serious adverse effects in a large cohort 
of participants52. Out of 120 participants, 64 responded to a follow-up questionnaire, and 
none experienced serious adverse effects. Only 7 out of the 64 participants reported mild to moderate symptoms (e.g., neck pain, attention problems, muscle twitches, and anxiety) that were perceived as 'possibly' or 'probably' related to their participation in LIFUP experiments. Notably, common unrelated symptoms included sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_66985]. Initial transient reports of mild neck pain, scalp tingling, and headaches were extinguished upon follow-up, with no new symptoms reported up to one month after the study 
52. 
Furthermore, studies have not shown any LIFUP-induced tissue damage in the absence of heating, except in cases where contrast agents were used to enhance cavitation effects 
26. Additionally, LIFUP has been shown to be safe even at intensities several times higher 
than the FDA limit for diagnostic ultrasound (720 mW/cm2) 53. Overall, the available 
evidence indicates that LIFUP is a safe and well-tolerated method for human neuromodulation, provided the proper guidelines and parameters are followed. 
Justification for the Risks Involved The proposed procedure entails minimal risks, while the potential knowledge gains hold 
significant importance for humanity. As a result, the risk-to-benefit ratio is very low. These experiments offer a unique opportunity to understand the neuromodulation's impact on human conscious perception. The potential insights gained from this study justify the minimal risks involved, making it a valuable and worthwhile endeavor. 
Procedures for Minimizing Risks All research subjects will under go a thorough screening process to ensure they meet the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Additionally, if any subjects express or exhibit anxiety related to the LIFUP procedure, they will have the opportunity to discuss their feelings or withdraw from the experiment if they wish. 
We are committed to strictly adhering to the FDA limit for diagnostic ultrasound intensity 
(as outlined in the FDA guidance docum ent on diagnostic ultrasound systems and 
transducers) during the LIFUP procedure to maintain safety and prevent any adverse effects. The FDA previously determined that the use of LIFUP in our studies carries nonsignificant risk (NSR). 
Adverse Events Adverse events will be monitored throughout the procedures and for [ADDRESS_73211] observed, any action taken, and ultimate outcome will be recorded. 
For all adverse events, sufficient informatio n will be pursued and/or obtained as to permit 
1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the event (i.e., whether the event should be classified as a serious adverse event) and; 2) an assessment of the causal relationship between the adverse event and the investigational device, or if applicable, the other study treatments of diagnostic product(s). Adverse events felt to be associated with the investigational device, or if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or 
stabilizes at a level acceptable to the sponsor-investigator. Adverse events will be 
reported to the IRB according to their reporting guidelines. 
Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Events An unanticipated adverse device event is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects. 
The sponsor-investigator will promptly review documented adverse events and abnormal 
test findings to determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a reas onable possibility that the adver se event was caused by [CONTACT_67001], if applicable, other study treatment of diagnostic products(s) and 3) if the adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event. The sponsor shall promptly report the results of an evaluation of any serious and unanticipated adverse event to the FDA, the University of Michigan IRBMED, and participating investigators (if any) as soon as possible, but not later than [ADDRESS_73212].

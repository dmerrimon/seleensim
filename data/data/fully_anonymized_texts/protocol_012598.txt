7.1 Overall trial design  
 
 For subjects transferred from the adolescent 
parent trial LP0162 -1334, the safety follow -
up period has been shortened from 16 weeks 
to 4 weeks.  To offer a shorter 
safety  follow -up 
period for the 
adolescent subjects 
to allow subjects the 
possibility of 
treatment prior to 
complete wash -out 
of tralokinumab. 
This is possible as 
no safety concerns 
were identified  in the 
parent trial.

1) If screening/baseline visits are performed on the same day as visit(s) in the parent trial, the order of assessments should b e adhered to, working in parallel for 
both protocols. Assessments where data are captured in different vendor systems databases (ECG, ePRO, and laboratory tests) need to be completed twice. I n 
such cases, the parent trial assessment should be performed first, followed by [CONTACT_548842]0162 -1337 assessment.  
2) Subjects who wit hdraw from the trial will be followed up as described in Section  10. All subjects will have a safety follow -up period of [ADDRESS_718153] dose of tralokinumab (that is, the final safety follow -up visit will be [ADDRESS_718154] dose).  
3) If the date of a trial visit does not conform to the clinical trial protocol, subsequent visits should be planned to maintain  the visit s chedule relative to baseline.  
4) The informed consent form must be signed prior to performing any protocol -related procedures, including but not limited to screening evaluations; for 
adolescent subjects participating in ECZTEND, legal representative(s) must sign a legal representative informed consent form and the adolescent subject must 
sign an informed assent form. Adolescent subjects who become adults during participation in ECZ TEND must re -consent by [CONTACT_548843]. Additional informed consent is required for participation in the exploratory part involving skin biopsy (selected trial sites  only) . 
5) All subjects must use an emollient, as backgr ound treatment, twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least [ADDRESS_718155] continue this 
treatment throughout the trial (including safety follow -up). 
6) At trial visits, tralokinumab will be injected at the trial site, preferably by [CONTACT_548844], alternatively by [CONTACT_6624]. At each trial visit from 
Week  4 onwards, subjects will be provided with tralokinumab to be administered at home until the next trial visit.  In case of intercurrent illness that may

Trial ID: LP0162 -1337  Date : 21-Feb-2022  Version: 14.[ADDRESS_718156], or fever  within 72 hours prior to administration , tralokinu mab administration should be rescheduled . If an anaphylactic 
reaction occurs, blood samples should be drawn for the analysis of  serum tryptase  (see details  in Section 9.2). 
7) At the first 3  tralokinumab dosing visits, subjects (or their caregiver) will be trained in how to inject tralokinumab, except for those who  have already been 
trained in home  use during the parent trial. In addition, if the subject and/or the caregiver is/are health care professional(s), no training  is required, but the 
subject should be trained in how to handle the IMP according to the IMP handling  manual and in the procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency. 
At the first 3  dosing visits, subjects (except for those who have received open -label tralokinumab treatment in the parent trial) will also be monitored for 
immediate drug reactions  for a minimum of 30  minutes after dosing, with vital signs taken after 30  minutes or until stable, whichever is later.  
8) IgE will not be measured at screening.  
9) Urine samples will be tested at the trial site (dipstick). In case of abnormal dipstick results, a urine sample will be sent to the central laboratory for microscopic 
examination (leucocytes, erythrocytes, and casts)  (Section  11.4.5 ). 
10) Adult sub jects from all parent trials, except the LP0162 -[ADDRESS_718157] during participation in ECZTEND.  
11) Subjects from the parent trial LP01 62-1334 will not perform the EuroQoL 5 -Dimension Health Questionnaire 5 -Level.  
12) Subjects from the parent trial LP0162 -1334 will perform an adolescent’s pruritis NRS with a recall period of past [ADDRESS_718158] during participation  in ECZTEND.  
13) Based on subject recall during the last week prior to each site visit (from 6  days prior to each visit and including the day of the visit).  
14) Optional at selected sites and only for subjects who had skin biopsies taken in the parent trial LP0162 -1325.

1) Subjects who withdraw from the trial will be followed up as described in Section  10. The final safety follow -up visit will be [ADDRESS_718162] dose (i.e. 
14 weeks after the EOT visit) . 
2) The number of weeks until the EOT visit ([ADDRESS_718163] dose of tralokinuma b, maximum  140 weeks) and SFU visit (maximum  154 weeks) for each 
subject will depend on the time of their trial entry and treatment duration.  
3) Assessments and procedures to be performed at an unscheduled visit are at the discretion of the investigator. If t he unscheduled visit involves administration of 
rescue treatment, the investigator should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (at least disease sev erity scores [IGA and EASI], 
concomitant medications/procedures, and AEs) immediate ly before administering any rescue treatment (see Section  9.5). 
4) If the date of a trial visit does not conform to the clinical trial protocol, subse quent visits should be planned to maintain the visit schedule relative to baseline.

5) At trial visits, tralokinumab will be injected at the trial site, preferably by [CONTACT_548844], alternatively  by [CONTACT_6624]. At each trial visit, subjects 
will be provided with tralokinumab to be administered at home until the next trial visit.  In case of intercurrent illness that may compromise the safety of the 
subject, or fever within 72 hours prior to administration, tralokinumab administration should be rescheduled. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, blood samples 
should be drawn for the analysis of serum tryptase (see details in Section 9.2). 
6) Urine samples will be tested at the trial site (dipstick). In case of abnormal dipstick results, a urine sample will be sent to the central laboratory for microscopic 
examination (leucocyte s, erythrocytes, and casts)  (Section  11.4.5 ). 
7) Adult subjects from all parent trials, except the LP0162 -[ADDRESS_718165] during participation in ECZTEND.  
8) Subjects from the parent trial LP0162 -1334 will not perform the EuroQoL 5 -Dimension Health Questionnaire 5 -Level.  
9) Subjects from  the parent trial LP0162 -1334 will perform an adolescent’s pruritis NRS with a recall period of past [ADDRESS_718166] during participation  in ECZTEND.

1) If screening/baseline visits are performed on the same day as visit(s) in the parent trial, the order of assessments should b e adhered to,  working in parallel for 
both protocols. Assessments where data are captured in different vendor systems databases (ECG, ePRO, and laboratory tests) n eed to be completed twice. In 
such cases, the parent trial assessment should be performed first, followed by [CONTACT_548842]0162 -[ADDRESS_718176] visit after May 2021 can be a site visit or a telephone visit.  
2) Subjects who withdraw from the trial will be followed up as described in Section  10. The final safety follow -up visit will be [ADDRESS_718177] dose  (i.e.

Week  [ADDRESS_718180], or fever within 72 hours prior to administration, tralokinumab administration should be  rescheduled . If an anaphylactic 
reaction occurs, blood samples should be drawn for the analysis of serum tryptase (see details in Section 9.2). 
9) At the first 3  tralokinumab dosing visits, subjects (or their caregiver) will be trained in how to inject tralokinumab, except for those who have already been 
trained in home  use during the parent trial. In addition, if the subject and/or the caregiver is/are health care professional(s), no training  is required, but the 
subject  should be trained in how to handle the IMP according to the IMP handling manual and in the procedures to be followed in the e vent of an emergency. 
At the first 3  dosing visits, subjects (except for those who have received open -label tralokinumab treatment  in the parent trial) will also be monitored for 
immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 30  minutes after dosing, with vital signs taken after 30  minutes or until stable, whichever is later.   
10) IgE will not be measured at screening.  
11) Urine samples will be t ested with a dipstick at the trial site. A urine sample will be sent to the central laboratory for further analysis only if c onsidered required

5 Introduction and trial rationale  
5.1 Atopic dermatitis  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may affect up to 20% of 
children and up to 10% of adults. In its severe form, AD is characterised by [CONTACT_421439], intractable itch, as well as increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal skin 
infections ( Bieber  2008, Hanifin  and Reed  2007, Silverberg  and Hanifin  2013, Weidinger  and 
Novak  2016). AD is associated with a substantial patient burden that typi[INVESTIGATOR_421406], sleep disturbance ( Jeon et al.  2017), and reductions in work  productivity 
(Kiebert  et al.  2002).  
AD is characterised by [CONTACT_421440] T -helper -2 (Th2) pathway with increased skin expression 
of key Th2 cytokines including interleukin (IL)  13 (Omori -Miyake  et al.  2014, Tazawa  et 
al. 2004). The expression of IL -13 is increased in lesional skin compared with non -lesional 
skin, and the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing IL -13 is upregulated in patients 
with AD compared with individuals without AD ( Aleksza  et al.  2002, Tazawa  et al.  2004).  
IL-13 acts on kerati nocytes to release C -C motif chemokine ligand  22 (CCL22) and recruit 
more IL -13 expressing Th2 cells, decrease differentiation, and contribute to decreased barrier 
function ( Purw ar et al.  2006). IL -13 also drives immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and 
contributes to mast cell activation status and, once allergen cross -links IgE on the cell surface, 
drives histamine release and induces itch ( Oh et al.  2013, Zheng  et al.  2009). Indeed, itch is a 
key issue in AD, which drives significant mechanical damage to the skin and further 
facilitates allergen and pathogen entry.  
These effects together drive and exace rbate the disease phenotype. A review of the available 
preclinical literature from mouse and human ex  vivo models suggests IL -13 as a, if not the, 
central mediator of the AD skin phenotype. Indeed, there is evidence that blocking the IL -4 
receptor (which i s part of the receptor complex that also binds IL -13) with the monoclonal 
antibody dupi[INVESTIGATOR_547667] ( Simpson  et al. 2016).  
5.[ADDRESS_718184]  
Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4 
(IgG4) subclass that specifically binds to human IL -13 and blocks interaction with the IL -13 
receptors ( Blanchard  et al.  2005, May et al.  2012, Thom  et al.  2012).  
The AD development programme investigates tralokinumab in subjects wit h 
moderate -to-severe AD. To date , [ADDRESS_718185] been completed: a phase 2b

dose-finding trial (trial D2213C00001 ), 2 phase 3 trials with tralokinumab as monotherapy 
(LP0162 -1325 and LP0162 -1326 ), a phase 3 trial with tralokinumab in combination with TCS 
(LP0162 -1339 ), a phase 2 vaccine response trial (LP0162 -1341 ), a phase 3 trial in adolescent 
subjects (LP0162 -1334), a phase 1 drug -drug interaction trial (LP0162 -1342) , a phase 3 trial 
in adult subj ects with severe AD ineligible to treatment with cyclosporin A (LP0162 -1346) , 
and a phase 3  trial with tralokinumab in combination with TCS (LP062-1343 ) in Japanese 
subjects with moderate -to-severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy .  
Based on the  results from the dose -finding trial, the dose of 300 mg tralokinumab was chosen 
for the phase 3 programme.  
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 trials (LP0162 -1325, -1326, and -1339), IGA, EASI, Pruritus NRS, 
SCORAD, and DLQI were included as the main assessments suppo rting the multiplicity -
adjusted primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The efficacy of tralokinumab as 
monotherapy in subjects with moderate -to-severe AD was demonstrated in the replicate 
confirmatory phase 3 trials (LP0162 -1325 and LP0162 -1326) with st atistically significant 
results for all primary and multiplicity -adjusted secondary endpoints at Week 16. Likewise, 
the efficacy of tralokinumab in combination with TCS was consistently demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_548847] m ultiplicity -adjusted secondary endpoints at 
Week [ADDRESS_718187] to immune responses to concomitantly administered, non -live vaccines was 
demonstrated in the LP0162 -1341 trial .  
A total of 4, 713 subjects across indications (healthy subjects, and subjects with AD, asthma, 
UC, and IPF) have been exposed to tralokinumab in 26 completed clinical trials , including 
2,524 subjects with AD in 9 completed clinical trials.  A total of 2,088 subjects with AD 
received tralokinumab 300  mg, and 1026 of these were exposed to tralokinumab for 52 
weeks.  
The safety data supports that tralokinumab was well -tolerated with a favorable  safety profile 
when used as a monotherapy or in combination with TCS in subjects with moderate -to-severe 
AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. The overall frequency  of SAEs was lower for 
tralokinumab compared with placebo , and the frequencies of AEs  leading to permanent 
discontinuation of treatment were low and similar for the 2 treatment groups. Overall, AEs 
were mild or moderate in severity, and transient in nature. Furthermore, tralokinumab was 
well-tolerated across all evaluated subgroups, and th e safety profile with self -administration 
of tralokinumab at home was similar to that observed after administration of tralokinumab at 
the site by [CONTACT_444485].

concerns have been identified. Possible risks associated with use of tralokinumab are 
summarised in Section  5.6.

period(s) in one of the ‘parent trials ’: LP0162 -1325, -1326, -1334, -1339, -1341,  
-1342, -1343, -1346 , or the investigator -initiated trial  TRA -WEI -0015 -I (see inclusion 
criterion no.  2). 
Subjects transferring from a blinded parent trial will enter the extension trial without their 
individual treatment all ocation in the parent trial being unblinded. It is assumed that the 
majority of the subjects entering into this trial will have received  tralokinumab  in the parent 
trial – and will in the investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_548797] d therapeutic benefit from 
tralokin umab .  
Optional use of TCS is included in this trial , as subjects transferring from trial s LP0162 -[ADDRESS_718190] 
had this option during their treatment  in the parent trial . Furthermore, the intended 
commercial use of tralokinumab is with or without concurrent use of TCS.  
5.4 Justification for dose  
The tralokinumab dosing regimen selected for this long -term extension trial is based on the 
dosing regimen used in the  earlier trials  in the  tralokinumab phase  3 development programme, 
which in turn is based on the results of the phase  2b trial (D2213C00001) in subjects with 
moderate -to-severe AD.  
The dose is 300  mg administered subcutaneously (SC) Q2W. Subjects from all parent trials , 
except  the parent trial LP0162 -1334, will get an initial loading dose of [ADDRESS_718191] treatment in the parent trial.

in this clinical trial. Furthermore, female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying 
to become pregnant will not be included . Female subjects of childbearing potential who are 
sexually active, must agree to use a highly effective method of  contraception to prevent 
pregnancy during the clinical trial and until [ADDRESS_718195] (IMP). In addition, all female subjects of childbearing

In accordance  with the current version of the International Council for Harmonisation  (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, qualified medical personnel employed by [CONTACT_548848] A/S (hereafter LEO Pharma) will be readily available to advise on trial -related 
medical questions. Medical monitoring will be performed throughout the trial. Safety data 
will be reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_548849], if needed, to maximise patient safety.  
In conclusion, the trial design chose n for this long-term safety trial with  tralokinumab is 
regarded as ethically justified and adherent with ethical requirements.

5.6 Benefit/ risk assessment  
There is an unmet medical need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_421410] -to-severe 
AD because  current immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, and 
azathioprine, are associated with long-term toxicities.  Based on the benefits in treating AD 
reported with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], there is a reasonable expectation that tralokinumab will p rove to be 
an effective treatment of moderate -to-severe AD. Although  dupi[INVESTIGATOR_547671] /risk profile  in clinical trials in AD, the long -term efficacy and safety experience with 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_547672].  
Tralokinumab has already demonstrated efficacy in moderate -to-severe AD  in a phase  2b trial 
in adult subjects , and the evidence discussed in Section  5.[ADDRESS_718199] in the benefit/risk evaluation is the reassuring safety profile of tralokinumab 
in AD, asthma, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonar y fibrosis, and in trials with healthy 
subjects.  
In the clinical trials completed to date, tralokinumab was well -tolerated. A number of 
theoretical potential risks have been identified, including hypersensitivity reactions, immune 
complex disease, severe i nfections, malignancies, and interference with reproductive function; 
measures are in place in this trial to protect participating subjects as follows:  
• Close monitoring of subjects during the trial , with site visits at least every 
16 weeks  (every 8 weeks until end of May 2021). Mandatory t elephone visits 
will be performed  between site visits to secure sufficient safety reporting after 
May 2021 ; for subjects from the parent trial LP0162 -1334 , this should 
preferably be a video call  (see Panel 2 and Section  4). 
• Close monitoring of subjects * after the first [ADDRESS_718200] hypersensitivity reactions (further details are 
given in Section  9.2). 
• * Except fo r subjects transferring from the open -label trial s LP0162 -[ADDRESS_718201]  received 
tralokinumab . 
• Monitoring of subjects for clinical  manifestations that may be associated with 
the development of specific antibodies to tralokinumab (immune complex 
disease).

Trial ID: LP0162 -1337  Date: 21-Feb-2022  Version: 14.[ADDRESS_718202] PARTY WITHOUT 
THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LEO PHARMA GROUP  
 
• Exclusion of subjects with untreated systemic helminth infestations or subjects 
who have failed to respond to standard of care ther apy; neutralisation of IL -13 
might theoretically cause a worsening of parasitic infestation, in particular 
prevention of expulsion of gastrointestinal worms (helminths) ( Bancroft  et 
al. 2000).  
• Exclusion of subjects with a history of tuberculosis requiring treatment within 
12 months prior to the screening visit.  
• Exclusion of subjects with a history of a clinically significant infection 
(defined as a systemi c or serious skin infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, 
antiviral, or anti -fungal medication; see Section  8.3) within 4  weeks prior to 
baseline which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335] ’s medical expert, 
may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial.  
In conclusion, previous clinical experience with tralokinumab shows no major safety or 
tolerability concerns , and appropr iate measures have been instituted in this trial to protect 
subjects from potential risks that have been previously identified and to sufficiently monitor 
each subject. The current risk/benefit profile  is considered favourable and supports the 
administrati on of tralokinumab with  or without  TCS therapy for the purposes of achieving the 
objectives of this trial . 
The current COVID -[ADDRESS_718203]  subjects ’ 
ability to attend visits at the trial site . To follow authorities ’ restrictions and to safeguard the 
subjects in the ECZTEND trial as well as providing continued therapy to secure the scientific 
integrity, th e clinical trial protoco l provide s an opportunity for telephone visits and courier 
delivery of IMP and pregnancy tests to subjects in replacement of the site visits (see Appendix  
3K for details).

7 Trial design  
7.1 Overall trial design  
7.1.1 Overview  
This is an open -label phase  3 trial to study the long -term safety of tralokinumab administered 
to adult subjects (≥18 years) and adolescent subjects (12 to <18 years) with AD  who 
participated in previous trials with tralokinumab . The trial will include  a screening period of 
2 weeks ( Week  -2 to Week  0), which is expected to  overlap  with the last period in the parent 
trial for the majority of subjects,  and a long -term treatment period of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_718213] consent ed to (end of May 2021, end of May 2022 , or a country -specific end of treat ment 
day according to Appendix 3J).  
The visit schedule until May 2021 is different from the visit schedule after May 2021, where a 
number of site visits were replaced by [CONTACT_548850] ( Panel 2 and Panel 5). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  COVID -[ADDRESS_718214] is unable to attend site visits due to the COVID -19 pandemic, 
please refer to Appendix  3K for guidance . 
7.1.2 Screening period  (Week  -2 to Week  0) 
Prior to attending any trial procedure, a signed informed consent must be obtained from the 
subject or the adolescent subject’s legally authorised representative(s), and a signed informed 
assent must be obtained from the adolescent subject (as appropriate and according to national 
laws and regulations).   
To avoid a gap between the parent trial and extension trial , screeni ng should ideally start 
before the end of the parent trial.  Hence, the screening period is expected to overlap with the 
last period in the parent trial  for the majority of subjects : the last visit in the parent trial could 
ideally coincide with the baseline visit of the extension trial.  However , subjects can be 
included in the ECZTEND trial up to [ADDRESS_718215] IMP dose in the parent trial . 
To avoid duplicate reporting of AEs, any AE with onset before  the final visit in the parent trial 
shou ld be reported as an AE in the parent trial . If ongoing, the AE should also be recorded as 
medical history in the current extension  trial (see Section  11.2.2 ). AEs with onset after the 
TMF-000057619 - Version 15.0

Trial ID: LP0162 -1337  Date: 21-Feb-2022  Version: 14.[ADDRESS_718216] can attend 
Visit 3  (baseline visit ). 
All subjects will use an emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least 14  days before 
baseline  and will continue this treatment throughout the trial (including safety follow -up). 
Subjects will initiate emollient treatment no later than at Week  -2. On lesional skin, emollient 
should only be applied at times where TCS are  not applied ( that is,  emollient and TCS should 
not be used on the same areas at the same time of day); on areas not treated with TCS, the 
emollient may be applied at all times.  
7.1.3 Treatment period (Week 0  and onwards ) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment initiation  
Following the screening period, and at least [ADDRESS_718217] dose in the parent trial, 
subjects from all parent trials except the p arent trial LP0162 -1334, will receive a n initial  
loading dose of 600  mg tralokinumab (4  mL) at baseline.  Subjects from the parent trial 
LP0162 -1334 will start with a dose of  300 mg tralokinumab (2  mL) at baseline. For the rest of 
the treatment period, all subjects will receive a dose of 300 mg tralokinu mab Q2W  (2 mL) . 
Tralokinumab will be administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection.  
Subjects will self -inject  tralokinumab – or have tralokinumab injected by a caregiver – in their 
home after adequate training by [CONTACT_548851] [ADDRESS_718218] treatment visit s (Weeks  0, 2, and 
4). Subjects who already have experience with home  use of tralokinumab from participation 
in open -label arms of trials LP0162 -1325 , -1326 , and -1334  can start self -injecting  at baseline 
without training  (see also Section 9.2). At the trial visits, tralokinumab will be injected at the 
trial site, preferably by [CONTACT_548844], alternatively by [CONTACT_6624].   
The first  [ADDRESS_718219]-dose monitoring for immediate drug 
reactions (see Section  9.2), as some subjects will have received placebo in the parent trial and 
are thus naïve to tralokinumab. Subjects who have transferred  from the open -label trial s 
LP0162 -[ADDRESS_718220] 3  doses of tralokinuma b in the parent trial  will not need  
to be observed.

THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LEO PHARMA GROUP  
 
Subjects can use TCS (US class ≥4 or Europe  class ≤3) or TCI at the investigator ’s discretion . 
If TCS are  used, the subject should be monitored for signs of local or systemic TCS toxicity, 
and the safety and appropriateness of  continued or repeated courses of TCS therapy should be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_6624].  
Treatment is described in more detail in Section 9. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment period until end of May 2021  (all subjects)  
All s ubjects included in the trial prior to protocol version 10, attend ed site visits every 
[ADDRESS_718222] visit before end of May  2021, and followed  the schedule s of trial 
procedures in Section 4.1.  
At end of May 2021, the procedures applicable depended on whether the subjects did NOT or 
DID accept to continue in the trial after May 2021:  
• Subject d id NOT  re-consent to continue in the trial  after May 2021 :  
The subject continue d to follow the trial procedures in Section 4.1. The subject 
had to be sup plied with IMP for home dosing until end of May 2021 , where 
treatment had to  be stopped .  
• Subject DID re-consent  to continue in the trial  after May 2021 :  
After signing the consent form ( subject or legal authorised representative ), as 
well as the assent form for adolescent subjects, the last visit before end of 
May 2021 had to be completed as a normal site visit (i.e. not as an EOT  visit). 
After tha t, the schedule  of trial procedures in Section  4.2 was followed (see 
description of treatment period after May 2021 in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment period after May 2021  
Subjects who wanted to participate  in the trial after May 2021  had to  re-consent (subjects 
included based on earlier p rotocol versions than version 10) or consent (subjects included 
based on protocol versions 10 to 12) to participate.  
Subjects who re -consented/consented to participate in the trial after May 2021 follow the 
modified schedule of trial procedures specified in Section 4.2:  
• For subjects included in the trial based on protocol versions 10 to 13, treatment 
will be initiated as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

Subjects will self -inject  tralokinumab – or have tralokinumab injected by a caregiver – in their 
home after adequate training by [CONTACT_548857] [ADDRESS_718254] and/or the caregiver is/are health care 
professional(s), no training is required, but the subject should be trained in how to handle the 
IMP according to the IMP handling manual and in the procedures to be foll owed in the event 
of an emergency . The individual who will be performing the injection  (that is, the subject, 
caregiver, or both) will be trained  in proper SC injection technique and procedures to be 
followed in the event of an emergency during or followin g home use of tralokinumab. The 
subject ( and/or caregiver) must inject tralokinumab under supervision by [CONTACT_548858] ’s understanding and

be administered  according to these instructions.  
IMP dosing/dispensing  visits are shown in the schedule of trial proc edures (Section  4). 
After administration of tralokinumab  
For the first 3  tralokinumab dosing visits (Week s 0, 2, and 4), subjects will be monitored for 
immediate drug reactions for a minimum of [ADDRESS_718258] 3  doses of tralokinumab in the parent trial , 
are exempt  from this monitoring.  
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World 
Allergy Organization has categorised anaphylaxis into 2  subgroups: allergic anaphylaxis 
(mediated by [CONTACT_421450]) and nonallergic anaphylaxis (which has a 
nonimmunologic cause)  (Johansson  et al.  2004). The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis 
for this trial are listed in Appendix  6 (Sampson  et al.  2006). Appropriate drugs, such as 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat acute 
anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at the trial sites, and trial personnel 
should be trained to recognise and respond to anaphylaxis according to local guidelines.  
If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the sub ject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60  minutes ± 30  minutes after the event, and at discharge, for 
analysis of serum tryptase at the central laboratory.  
Conditions requiring rescheduling of tralokinumab administration  
If any of the following shoul d occur, the investigator should reschedule the visit and 
tralokinumab should not be administered until the rescheduled visit:  
• The subject has an intercurrent illness that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
may compromise the safety of the subject during  the tri al (for example, viral 
illness ). 
• The subject is febrile (defined as ≥38°C) within 72  hours prior to 
administration of tralokinumab.

(including the safety follow -up). 
9.5 Rescue treatment  
If medically necessary (that is, to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD 
may be provided to trial subjects at the discretion of the investigator. I f possible, i nvestigat ors 
should attempt to limit the first step of rescue therapy to topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910] , and escalate to 
systemic medications only for subjects who do not respond adequately after at least 14  days 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786] .  
Subjects who receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_548803] ( higher potency TCS: US class <4 or Europe  
class >3 ) will continue treatment with IMP. If TCS are  used as rescue treatment , the subject 
should  be monitored for signs of local or systemic TCS toxicity , and the safety and 
appropriateness of continued use should  be supervised by [CONTACT_6624].  
If a subject receives rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or non -steroidal systemic 
immunosuppressive drugs (for example, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycoph enolate mofetil, 
azathioprine), treatment with IMP will be immediately discontinued (see Section  10.2.3 ). 
After the treatment with these medication s is completed, IMP may be resumed if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_093], but not sooner than [ADDRESS_718262] efficacy and safety assessments (at least 
disease severity scores [IGA and EASI], concomitant medications/procedures, and AEs) 
immediately before administering any rescue treatment.  An unscheduled visit may be u sed for 
this purpose, if necessary.

• Route of administration.  
Similarly, concurrent procedures must also be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and the 
eCRF. Note that only surgical procedures and procedures related to AD treatment (for 
example, phototherapy or bleach baths) should be recorded. The following details will be 
recorded: procedure, body location (upper limb, l ower limb, trunk, head), diagnosis, and start 
and stop date (it will also be recorded if the procedure is ongoing).  
At all site visits  and telephone visit s, subjects should  be asked wheth er they have used TCS or 
TCI (see below) during the past week – to ma ke it possible to assess whether the individual 
efficacy response is achieved with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_548804]. 
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments to provide adequate 
supporti ve care as deemed necessary, except for medications listed in Section  9.7. The 
sponsor ’s medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_73371][CONTACT_9297].  
The following concomitant medications related to AD treatment are permitted from screening

9.8 Treatment logistics and a ccountability  
9.8.1 Labelling and p ackaging of trial products  
The IMP will be packaged in individually numbered kits, each containing 1  syringe 
(tralokinumab 150  mg). 
Primary and secondary packaging materials (syringe and outer carton, respectively) will be 
individually labelled.  
The labelling of IMP will be in accordance with Annex  13, local regulations, and trial 
requirements. Label text  will be translated into local languages , as required . 
9.8.[ADDRESS_718267] be stored at 2–8°C at the trial site. The temperature during storage should be 
monitored by a calibrated , stationary, and continuously monitoring  system. Minimum 
requirement is a calibrated min/max thermometer.  
A temperature log mus t be kept to document the storage within the right temperature interval. 
Storage facilities should be checked at least every working day.  
Storage of IMP may be delegated, for example to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601], as locally applicable.  
Note that in the cases lis ted below, site staff should not use the affected IMP and should 
immediately contact [CONTACT_547713]:  
• Temperature excursion upon receipt or during storage at the trial site.  
• Damaged kit upon receipt.  
• Damaged syringe.  
Damaged IMP should be documented in the IRT  and reported as a product complaint (see 
Section  9.10). Damaged IMP may not be used.  
Further details on IMP storage  (includin g handling of such cases as listed above)  and home 
use are provided in a trial product handling manual . The pamphlet given to subjects with 
instructions for IMP self -administration  also provides instruction on IMP storage during home 
use.

If screening/baseline visits are performed on the same day as visit(s) in the parent trial the 
following applies:  
• The order of assessments should be adhered to, working in parallel for both 
protocols.  
• Assessments where data are captured in different vendor systems databases 
(ECG, ePRO , and laboratory tests) need to be c ompleted twice. In such cases , 
the parent trial assessment should be performed first, followed by [CONTACT_548866]0162 -1337 assessment.  
Subjects may also need to be seen at unscheduled visits during the course of the trial. The 
assessments to be performed at an unscheduled visit are left at the investigator ’s discretion 
(could include any assessment performed at an early t ermination visit), except if the 
unscheduled visit involves administration of rescue treatment. In that case, the investigator 
should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (at least disease 
severity scores [IGA and EASI], concomitan t medications/procedures, and AEs) immediately 
before administering any rescue treatment.  
Subjects participating in the trial will be under careful supervision of a dermatologist  or 
allergist . Investigators must be experienced in treating AD and have docum ented experience 
or training in use of the assessments required by [CONTACT_421464] a physician , 
certified physician ’s assistant, or advanced registered nurse practitioner.  
AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_82048] (Section  13.2).

The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values 
indicating more severe or more extensive condition . The index will be calculated as shown in 
Panel  12. Briefly, t he investigator will assess the severity of 4  AD disease characteristics 
(erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) on the 4 body regions 
(head/neck, trunk, upper extremities , lower extremities ); severity will be assessed according 
to the scale shown in Panel  13. For each body region, a severity sum score will be calculated 
which will be multiplied by [CONTACT_73307] (Panel  13) and by a weigh ting factor . The EASI 
score equals the sum of the scores obtained for each body region ( Panel  12).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Scoring Atopic Dermatitis  
The SCORAD is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD  lesions,  along with 
subjective symptoms  (European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis  1993 ). The maximum total 
score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease. SCORAD will be assessed 
according to the schedule of trial procedures (Section  4). 
The assessment will be based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation and not 
in relation to the condition at a previous visit. Whene ver possible, SCORAD should be 
assessed by [CONTACT_421467] -rater variability.  
The assessment consists of 3  components: A = extent , B = intensity , and C = subjective 
symptoms : 
Extent (A)  
The extent  of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the 
sum of all areas (maximum score = 100%) . 
Intensity (B)  
The intensity  of 6 specific symptoms of AD (erythema, oedema/p apulation, oozing/crusting , 
excoriation, lichenification , and dryness) is assessed by [CONTACT_421468]:  
0 = None/absent  
1 = Mild 
2 = Moderate  
3 = Severe  
Note: dryness is evaluated on uninvolved areas.  
The sum of intensity score of the 6 symptoms  will be reported (maximum score = 18 ). 
Subjective symptoms (C)  
A subjective assessment of the average itch and sleeplessness over the last 3  days/nights is 
recorded for each symptom by [CONTACT_1175] a visual analogue scale , where 0 is no itch (or 
sleeple ssness) and [ADDRESS_718295] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum 
possible score of 20.  
The SCORAD is calculated  as: A/5 + 7B/2  + C.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Oriented Eczema Measure  
The POEM is a validated questionnaire used to assess  disease symptoms in atopic eczema 
patients in both clinical practice and clinical trials ( Charman  et al. 2004 ). The tool consists of 
7 items each addressing a specific symptom (itching, sleep, bleeding, weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cracking, 
flaking, and dryness). Subjects will score how often they have experienced each symptom 
over the previous week on a 5 -point c ategorical response scale (0 = no days; 1 = 1 to 2 days ; 
2 = 3 to 4 days ; 3 = 5 to 6 days; 4 = every day ). The total score is the sum of the 7  items 
(range 0 to 28) and reflects disease -related morbidity; a higher score indicates worse disease 
severity. The POEM will be completed at the trial site according to  the schedule of trial 
procedures in Section  4. It will be completed electronically on the device supplied to the trial 
site and is included in the i nvestigator trial file.

11.7 Estimate of total blood volume collected  
Blood samples will be drawn for analysis of safety (chemistry, haema tology, and serology),  
PK, and ADA . 
The total volume of blood to be drawn for each subject will depend on the time of their entry 
in the trial and the local duration of the trial ( Appendix 3J). For adult subjects, the total blood 
volume drawn will be approximately 265 mL until end of May 2021, plus 70 mL per year of 
trial participation after May  2021. For adolescents, the total amoun t of blood drawn until end 
of May  2021 will be approximately 130 mL, plus 70 mL for the 1  year extension until end of 
May 2022.  
The volume of blood drawn at any visit during the trial will be approximately 20 mL  for all 
subjects . The maximum possible blood volume drawn at one visit is less than 1% of the total 
blood volume , and the maximum possible blood volume drawn within 4 weeks is less than 
3% of the total blood volume, as recommended for the age group 0–18 years  (European 
Commission  2008).

eligibility criteria are chosen to ensure that subjects from the parent trials can safely be 
included in this long -term trial.  Subjects will have the possibility to use tralokinumab both 
with an d without TCS (US class ≥4 or Europe  class ≤3), reflecting the intended use of 
tralokinumab in real clinical practice.  
Long -term safety will be assessed using standard clinical methods of subject evaluations, such 
as AE monitoring, ECG, vital sign s, and clinical laboratory measurements. Furthermore, data 
on antibodies against tralokinumab (ADAs) will be collected and the potential  for 
immunogenicity will be evaluated until the end of the safety follow -up period. The serum 
samples for determination of presence or absence of ADA, along with blood concentrations of 
tralokinumab, will be analysed using validated bioanalytical methods.  
The clinical efficacy of tralokinum ab treatment will be assessed using  IGA, EASI, and 
SCORAD. IGA is a key instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject ’s 
global AD. EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinica l trials to assess 
the severity and extent of AD ( Hanifin  et al.  2001 ). SCORAD is a validated tool to assess the 
extent and severity of AD lesions and subj ective symptoms ( European Task Force on Atopic 
Dermatitis  1993 ). The efficacy endpoints IGA score of 0 or 1 and EASI75 are recognised as 
important endpoints in clinical trials i n AD by [CONTACT_548872],  EU, and Japan . 
The clinical efficacy of tr alokinumab treatment will also be assessed using PROs related to 
disease symptoms,  quality of life, general  health status, itch, and sleep quality.  POEM is a 
validated questionnaire used to assess disease symptoms in atopic eczema patients in both 
clinical  practice and clinical trials ( Charman  et al. 2004) , and is recommended by [CONTACT_548873] -reported symptoms in 
eczema trials . DLQI /CDLQI  is a validated and widely used questionnaire designed to 
measure the quality of life of dermatological patients ( Finlay  and Khan  1994 , CDLQI

and is therefore not to be pe rformed in ECZTEND for subjects from the parent trial 
LP0162 -1334.  
The trial design has been modified with protocol version  10 to secure long -term safety data of 
up to 5 years globally. The treatment extension for subjects from the parent trials 
LP0162 -1325, -1326, -1339, -1341, -1342,  -1343, -1346, and TRA -WEI -0015 -I will be 
country -specific to allow for treatment with tralokinumab until tralokinumab is available to 
patients  outside the clinical trial setting (Appendix 3J). Subjects from the ongoing adolescent 
parent trial LP0162 -1334 are  offered a total treatment extension of 1 year  until end of May 
2022 . 
The trial design was modified while the trial was ongoing (effective after May 2021) to 
decrease the burden of frequent site visits for subjects by [CONTACT_2359] a visit schedule more 
similar to standard practice for home use.  To ensure close  safety monitoring throughout the 
treatment pe riod, a mandatory telephone visit will be performed in between site visits.

AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_82048].  
At all  visits , the subject will be asked a non -leading question by [CONTACT_178449], 
for example : “How have you felt since I saw you last?” No specific symptoms should  be 
asked for. At the site visits, it is important that the investigator  also observes the subject for 
any changes not reported by [CONTACT_73319].   
Clinically significant abnormal findings related to vital sig ns, physical examination, ECGs, or 
laboratory tests after the screening visit must be reported as an AE, as described in 
Sections  11.4.[ADDRESS_718328] be recorded on the AE form 
of the eCRF and should be described in the following manner:  
The AE term  must  be in precise English medical terminology ( that is, not necessarily the exact 
words used by [CONTACT_423]). Whenever possible, a specific diagnosis should be stated ( for 
example  ‘allergic contact [CONTACT_8748] ’).

protocol .  
The term ‘overdose ’ including a specification of why it occurred ( accidental or intentional ) 
must be documented on the AE form of the eCRF. In addition , AEs originating from overdose 
must be documented  on a separate line.  If the AE originating from the overdose qualifies as 
an SAE, expedited reporting is required ( Section  13.4). 
If the overdose is accidental and due to a device deficiency, the device deficiency must be 
reported as a product complaint as described in Section  9.10. 
LEO Pharma does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. The investigator will 
use clinical judg ement to treat any overdose if necessary.  
13.6.[ADDRESS_718340]. Broadly, medication errors fall into 
4 categories: wrong medication, wrong dose (including strength, form, concentration, amount, 
as well as administration with an interval of less than 7 days), wrong route of administration, 
or wrong subject.  
The medication error category must be documented on the AE form in the eCRF. In addition , 
AEs originating from a medication error must be documented on a separate line.  If the AE 
originating from the medication error qualifies as an SAE, expedited reporting is required 
(Section 13.4). 
If the medication error is due to a device deficiency , the device deficiency  must be reported as 
a product complaint as described in Section  9.10. 
13.6.4  Misuse  
Misuse refers to situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in 
accordance with the protocol.  
The term ‘misuse ’ must be documented on the AE form in the eCRF. In addition , AEs 
originating from misuse must be documented on a separate line.  If the AE originating from

13.6.5  Abuse  
Abuse relates to the sporadic or persistent, intentional excessive use of an IMP which is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
The term ‘abuse ’ must be documented  on the AE form in the eCRF. In addition , AEs 
originating from abuse must be  documented on a separate line.  If the AE originating from 
abuse qualifies as an SAE,  expedited reporting is required ( Section 13.4). 
13.6.6  Aggravation of condition  
Any clinically significant aggravation/exacerbation/worsening of any medical condition(s) 
(including the trial disease), compared with baseline , must be reported as  an (S)AE in 
accordance with Sections  13.3 and 13.4. 
AD is a fluctuating disease with possible periods of remission. In case of relapses/recurrences, 
only aggravations/exacerbations exceeding normal disease fluctuation or lesions appearing in 
a body area normally not affected by [CONTACT_548875].  
13.7 Follow -up for final outcome of adverse events  
During the trial , the investigator should follow up for final outcome on all AEs (including 
SAEs). Once a subject leaves the clinical trial,  the investigator should follow up on the 
outcome of all non -serious AEs classified as of possible/probable relationship to the IMP for

example chronic or stabilised conditions, the final outcome at the investigator's discretion 
should be reported as 'recovering/resolving' or ‘not recovered/not re solved ’. In addition, a 
statement that the SAE has stabilised or is chronic should be added to the narrative 
description of the SAE on the SAE form.  
13.8 Handling of an urgent safety measure  
An urgent safety measure is a measure taken to implement an action/pr otocol deviation under 
an emergency. This is defined as “…the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct 
of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event 
is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take

(European Parliament and Council of The European Union  2001).  
If the investigator becomes aware of information that necessitates an immediate change in the 
clinical trial procedure or a temporary halt to the clinical trial in order to protect clinical trial 
subjects from any immediate hazard to their health and safety, the investigator can do so 
without prior approva l from LEO  Pharma , regulatory authorities , or IRBs/IECs . 
The investigator must immediately inform LEO  Pharma  – by [CONTACT_73325] – of this change in the clinical trial procedure or of the temporary 
halt providing full details of the information and the decision -making  process leading to the 
implementation of the urgent safety measure.  
LEO Pharma must act immediately upon receipt of t he urgent safety measure notification in 
accordance with internal procedures  and local legislation .

14 Statistical m ethods  
14.1 Sample size 
The assumed size of this trial is approximately 1,600 subjects. No formal sample size has 
been calculated; the sample size is based on the population sizes of the parent trials and 
assumptions regarding how many subjects will complete the parent trials and be eligible for / 
consent to participate in the current trial . 
14.2 Trial analysis sets 
All screened subjects will be accounted  for in the CTR.  
All subjects receiving tralokinumab  will be  included in the full analysis set  (FAS)  and will be 
analysed for efficacy. Exclusions from the FAS can be considered in special cases as 
described in ICH E9, section 5.2.1., Full Analysis Set. If  it is decided to exclude a subject who 
has received tralokinumab  from the FAS, a justification addressing ICH E9 will be given.  
The safety analysis set will be identical to the FAS  and will be used for summarising safety.  
Data from the investigator -initia ted parent trial TRA -WEI -0015 -I will not be transferred to 
LEO Pharma . Thus , endpoints defined as change from baseline (in parent trial ) will not be 
calculated for subjects from this trial , and data from this trial will not be included in tables 
summarising endpoints defined as change from baseline or where data are presented by 
[CONTACT_548876]/non -responder . Subjects  from this parent trial will be contributing to the primary 
endpoint and include d in summary tables where possible.  
The decisions regarding incl usion/exclusion of subjects or subject data from the trial analysis 
sets will be documented in an analysis set definition document . 
14.3 Statistical analysis  
14.3.1  Disposition of subjects  
The reasons fo r withdrawal from the trial will be presented for all subjects  assigned treatment . 
14.3.2  Demographics and other baseline characteristics  
Descriptive statistics of demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, race) and the latest treatment 
regimen in the parent trial (placebo, tralokinumab, tralokinumab + TCS) will be presented for 
the total cohort of subjects and by [CONTACT_548839] -naïve/re -treated/continuously treated 
subjects. For the re -treated and continuously treated subjects , the presentation will furthe r be

divide d by [CONTACT_548877]/non -responder in the parent trial ; clinical response is defined as 
achievement of IGA 0/[ADDRESS_718346] IMP dose 
to the date of the end of treatment visit, or – if the end of treatment visit is missing – to the 
date of permanent discontinuation of IMP.  
Treatment compliance  
Adherence to treatment regimen will be recorded in the eCRF. The log of drug administration 
may be used as source. If any complications or deviations in admi nistration are observed, 
these will be described as protocol deviations.  
Adherence will be presented for the safety analysis set.  
14.3.4  Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint in this trial is number of adverse events  during  the treatment period 
from baseline  up to Week  268, and the analysis of this is covered in Section  14.3.8 . 
14.3.5  Secondary efficacy endpoints  
The analy ses of the secondary efficacy endpoints wi ll be done for the FAS as well as for the 
observed cases . Subjects fulfilling  the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]  (see Section  10.2.1 ) will be withdrawn 
from trial, and no observed  data will be available after withdrawal.  As a consequence, 
subjects withdrawn will be regarded as non -responders in the FAS analysis.  
IGA and EA SI75 will be presented as response rates with 95% confidence interval s at each 
assessment v isit. The results will be presented for the total cohort of subjects and by 
[CONTACT_548839] -naïve/re -treated/continuously treated subjects. For the re -treated and 
conti nuously treated subjects the results wi ll further be divided by [CONTACT_548877]/non -responder in 
the parent trial ; clinical response is defined as achievement of IGA 0/[ADDRESS_718347] 
assessment in the parent trial . 
In the evaluation of EASI75 , the baseline  score  will be that from  the parent trial.

14.3.6  Other endpoints  
Change s from baseline  in EASI score and SCORAD  will be presented as number of 
observations (N), mean, standard deviation (SD),  median, minimum,  and maximum  at each 
assessment visit. The baseline  scores  used will be  those  from the parent trial.  
The change s from baseline  in EASI score and SCORAD will be presented  for the FAS as well 
as for the observed cases . 
[ADDRESS_718349]  during  the treatment period will be included:  
• Proportion of t ime with EASI75 after first occurrence of EASI75  during 
treatment . 
• Proportion of time with EASI50 after first occurrence of EASI50  during 
treatment . 
• Proportion of time with IGA 0/[ADDRESS_718350] occurren ce of IGA 0/[ADDRESS_718351]  will be calculated as the time 
with EASI75 (that is, the sum of time intervals with EASI75) divided by [CONTACT_548878]75. The time intervals in  which EASI75 is observed at 
the start of the interval will be accumulated and normalis ed with the total treatment time from 
first EASI assessment with EASI75 until end of treatment.  
The proportion of time with EASI50 and with IGA = 0/[ADDRESS_718352]  occurrence during 
treatment will be  determined using the same principle as for the proportion of time with 
EASI75.  
These ‘proportion of time’ endpoints will each be presented as number of observations (N), 
mean, SD, median, minimum,  and maximum.  The group mean comprising the summed 
nominators (of time) divided by [CONTACT_548879].  
As the frequency of site visits is reduced after May 2021, a sensitivity analysis excluding data 
captured after May 2021 will be perfor med for the ‘proportion of time ’ endpoints. For 
exploratory purposes, the proportion of subject s achieving EASI75 will be plotted versus the 
proportion of  time with EASI75 (ranging from 0–100% of the observation period after first 
occurrence of EASI75) . Similar plots for EASI50 and IGA 0/1 will be shown in the same 
graph.  
The results for the endpoints  described  in this section will be presented for the total cohort of 
subjects and by [CONTACT_548839] -naïve/re -treated/continuously treated subjects. For the re-treated

and continuously treated subjects , the results wi ll further be divided by [CONTACT_548877]/non -
responder in the parent trial  (clinical response as defined in Section  14.3.5 ). 
The primary reasons for discontinuation of IMP over time  will be presented relative to the 
number of subjects receiving treatment at Week  0. 
14.3.7  Patient -reported outcomes  
Change s from baseline in POEM score , DLQI /CDLQI  score, and EQ -5D-5L score will be 
presented in the same way as change s from baseline in EASI score and SCORAD (see  
Section  14.3.6 ). The baseline score s used will be  those  from the parent trial. In the special 
case where a subject has an assessment at both Week 80 and Week 88, the Week 80 
assessment (corresponding to approximately 1½ years) will be used for the Week 80 -88 
endpoint evaluation. Likewise, the  Week 128 assessment (~ 2½ years) will be prioritised for 
the Week [ADDRESS_718354] EQ -5D-5L assessments in the parent trial, the change from baseline is 
not applicable.  Changes from baseline will not be presented for subjects from the parent trial 
TRA -WEI -0015 -I, since data from this investigator -initiated trial will not be transferred to 
LEO  Pharma (see Section 14.2). 
The Worst Weekly Pruritus NRS /adolescent ’s pruritis NRS  score , the Eczema -related Weekly 
Sleep NRS /adolescent ’s eczema -related NRS  score , and the change from baseline (in the 
current trial) in both scores  will be summarised descriptively by [CONTACT_548880], SD, median, 
minimum , and maximum values . 
The use of  topic al treatment during the la st week as a binary score will be summarised 
descriptively by [CONTACT_765].  
14.3.8  Safety  
The analysis of safety will be based on the safety analysis set.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse events  
AEs will be coded during the course of the trial according to  Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_548881]-000057619 - Version 15.0

system organ class  (SOC)  as percentage of subjects with AEs, number of AEs, and rate of AEs 
(number of AEs per 100  patient -years of exposure ). 
Only treatment -emergent AEs will be summarised;  however , all AEs recorded during the 
course of the trial will be included in subject data listings. An AE will be considered 
treatment -emergent if started after the first use of IMP , or if started before the first use of IMP 
and worsened in severity after first dose of IMP . The tabulations described in the following 
will only include treatment -emergent AEs. In each of the tabulations, AEs are d efined by 
[CONTACT_548882] . 
An overall summary of the number of AEs, the rate of AEs (number of AEs per 100  patient -
years of exposure),  the number (percentage) of subjects with any treatment -emergent AEs, 
deaths, SAEs, withdrawals  from the trial due to AEs, treatment -related AEs , and severe AEs 
will be presented.  The above summaries will also be made separately for subjects who 
transferred from the parent trial LP0162 -1334. As the frequency of site visits is reduced after 
May 2021, an additional overall AE summary tabl e will be presented that excludes events and 
exposure time after May 2021. In addition to the overall summary, the data will be present ed 
by [CONTACT_548839] -naïve/re -treated/continuously treated subjects.  
The number of AEs, rate of AEs,  and number of subjects  with each type of AE  will be 
tabulated for the total cohort of subjects and by [CONTACT_548839] -naïve/re -treated/continuously 
treated subjects.  
The severity and causal relationship to IMP for each type of AE will be tabulated.  
Related AEs ar e defined as AEs for which the investigator has not described the causal 
relationship to IMP as ‘not related ’. The number of subjects with each type of related AE will 
be tabulated.  
SAEs and AESIs will be evaluated separately . A narrative for each SAE will be given . AESIs 
and AEs leading to withdrawal from the trial will be tabulated  and listed . 
AEs leading to withdrawal from trial will  be listed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital signs  
The change in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) from baseline  (in the 
current trial)  to each visit  will be summarised by [CONTACT_548880], SD, median, minimum,  and 
maximum  values.  The changes will be presented for the total cohort of s ubjects and by

[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical laboratory evaluation  
The change in each of the laboratory parameters from baseline  (in the current trial)  to each 
visit will be summarised as mean, SD, median, minimum,  and maximum values . The changes 
will be presented for the total cohort of subjects and by [CONTACT_548883] -naïve/re -
treated /continuously treated subjects.  
Laboratory parameters will be classified as ‘low’, ‘normal ’ or ‘high’, depending on whether 
the value is below, within , or above the reference range, respectively. A shift table will be 
produced showing the categories at baseline against those at end of treatment . The changes 
will be presented for the total cohort of subjects and by [CONTACT_548839] -naïve/re -
treated/continuously treated subjects. Subjects with laboratory parameters outside the 
reference range  will be listed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anti -drug antibodies  
The prese nce of ADAs is an endpoint included to assess the immunogenicity  of tralokinumab.  
The ADA status will be summarised by [CONTACT_548884]:  
ADA status  Description  
Positive, pre -existing  ADA positive at baseline. No post -baseline ADA 
response ≥[ADDRESS_718357]-baseline

Treatment -emergent, trans ient Neither persistent nor indeterminate.  
 
The association of ADA status across the trial (positive versus negative) with AEs/SAEs may 
be evaluated. The ADA -positive subjects across the trial may in this evaluation  be divided 
into the categories given above . The associations between ADA and AE/SAEs may be 
summarised for persistent ly, indeterminate ly, and  transient ly positive subjects . 
Serum samples that test positive for ADA will be analysed for  neutralising antibodies ( nAB ). 
The test sample will be  deemed positive or negative for the presence of nAB to tralokinumab 
relative to a pre -determined (in assay validation) statistically derived cut point.  
For subjects in the safety analysis set with positive ADA status, the ADA titre, nAB status, 
tralokinum ab concentration, IGA assessment, and EASI assessment will listed by [CONTACT_548886]. The listing will include  information about which parent trial the subjects transferred 
from and what treatment they received in the parent trial.  
14.3.9  Pharmacokinetics  
All the PK samples in the trial are trough samples. The trough concentration  (Ctrough) will be 
listed and  descriptive statistics  will be provided.  
Ctrough values from subjects with positive ADA/nAB  will be compared with  values from 
subjects with negative ADA/nAB , if data permit.  
The PK data may be merged with those from other clinical trials with tralokinumab for a 
population -based meta -analysis. Results of the meta -analysis will be presented in a separate

14.3.11  General principles  
An observ ed-cases approach will be used for tabulations of data by [CONTACT_765] ( that is, involving 
only those subjects who attended each specific visit).  
Categorical data will be summarised using the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category. Continuous data wil l be summarised using the mean, median, SD, minimum , and 
maximum values.  
Any changes from the statistical analysis planned in this clinical trial protocol will be 
described and justified in a protocol amendment , the statistical analysis plan update , or the 
CTR , depending  on the type of change . 
14.3.12  Handling of missing values  
Missing values will not be imputed, but will be handled as  described  in Sections  14.3.5  and 
14.3.6  by [CONTACT_548887] .

Appendix  1: Definitions of adverse events and serious adverse events  
Adverse event definition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be a ny unfavourable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  (ICH Harmoni zed Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 
E6 (R1)).  
This definition includes:  
• Accidental injuries.  
• Events related to trial procedures.  
• Reasons for any unfavourable and unplanned change in  medication (drug 
and/or dose).  
• Clinically significant wor sening  of pre -existing conditions.  
• Reasons for admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548813] . 
• AEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological 
effect of the IMP.  
• Any laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_1275] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Serious a dverse event definition  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that  
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]. 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548814] ’s medical 
record.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .

• or  
• Is a medically important condition. Events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548815]. Examples are intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm , blood dyscrasias and convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] , development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
• Adverse events of spec ial interest are described in Section  13.6.1 .

THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LEO PHARMA GROUP  
 
Appendix  2: Classification of adverse events  
Severity  
The severity  of the AE should  be described in terms of mild, moderate , or severe according to 
the investigator ’s clinical judgement.  
Mild  An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usu al 
activities of daily living.  
Moderate  An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the 
subject.  
Severe  An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
If the severity of an AE worsens, a new AE should be recorded.  
Causality  
The causal relation  of the AE to the u se of the IMP should  be classified using the below 
categories  of probable, possible , or not related according to the in vestigator ’s clinical 
judgement . 
Probably 
related  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. 
 
Could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73258] . 
 
Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. 
 
Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the IMP. 
 
Reappears or worsens upon re -challenge . 
TMF-000057619 - Version 15.0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1337  Date: 21-Feb-2022  Version: 14.[ADDRESS_718370] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73258] . 
 
Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. 
Not related  
 Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
IMP. 
 
Is better explained by [CONTACT_73343] ’s clinical state, 
environmenta l or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73258] . 
 
Does not reappear or worsen upon re -challenge . 
 
Does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP. 
 
Outcome  
The outcome  of the ev ent according to the investigator ’s clinical judgement should  be 
classified  using the categories below.  
TMF-000057619 - Version 15.0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1337  Date: 21-Feb-2022  Version: 14.[ADDRESS_718371] PARTY WITHOUT 
THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LEO PHARMA GROUP  
 
Recovered/  
resolved  The event has stopped. The stop date of the event must be recorded.  
Recovering/  
resolving  The subject is clearly recovering from an eve nt. The event is not yet 
completely resolved.  
Not 
recovered/  
not resolved  Event is still ongoing.  
Recovered /   
resolved  with 
sequelae  The event has reached a state where no further changes are expected and the 
residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after 
stroke.  
 
The stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of a SAE, the sequelae 
should be specified.  
Fatal  The subject has died as a consequence of the event. Date of death is recorded 
as stop date for the AE.  
Unknown  Unknown to investigator, for example  subject lost to follow -up. 
 
Note that as per the above definition, LEO Pharma uses “RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” only if 
an event has actually stopped. According to the CDISC definition, the category 
“RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” also includes events which have improved. However, 
following the LEO  Pharma  definitions above, such an improved event will instead be 
classified as “NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED ” or “RECOVERING/RESOLVING ”. 
Similarly, it should be noted that as per the above defin ition, LEO Pharma uses 
“RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE ” only if an event has reached a state where 
the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. According to CDISC, an event is considered 
“WITH SEQUELAE ”, if it has “retained pathological conditions ”. Consequently, it is likely 
that some of the events classified by [CONTACT_73344] 
“RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE ” could have been classified with the 
outcome “RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” according to the CDISC definition.  
For SAEs which have stabilised and cannot be expected to recover during study or safety 
follow -up periods, for example chronic or stabilised conditions, the final outcome should be 
kept as ‘recovering/resolving ’ or ‘not recovered/not resolved ’. In addition , a statement that the 
SAE has stabilised or is chronic should be added to the narrative description of the SAE on 
the SAE form. Please note that the event should not be reported as ‘recovered ’ on the SAE 
form .

objectives: (i) to continually verify source data to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by 
[CONTACT_18029], complete, and verifiable from source documents; (ii) to

THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LEO PHARMA GROUP  
 
confirm that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and (iii) to confirm that the 
trial is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other trial 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the  trial site ’s recrui tment rate and the 
compliance of the trial site with the protocol and ICH GCP.  
In order to perform their role effectively, CRAs and persons involved in quality assurance and 
inspections will need direct access  to source data, for example  medical records, l aboratory 
reports, appointment books, etc. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit 
trail, the investigator must provide the CRA with signed and dated printouts. In addition, 
relevant site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between 
monitoring visits ( for example  by [CONTACT_756]).  
Protocol compliance  
Protocol  deviations will be documented and notified to the investigator . Protocol deviations 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_548891].  
Sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections  
The clinical trial will be subject to audits conducted by [CONTACT_73349]/IECs. Audits and inspections may 
take place during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO Pharma 
staff have an obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving 
auditors and inspectors direct access to all source documents and other documents at the trial 
site relevant to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine, verify and reproduce 
any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial.  
If the trial site is contact[CONTACT_548892], LEO must be notified 
immediately.  
Risk assessment  
In this trial, overall risks have been assessed to ensure subject safety  and will be continuously 
monitored during the trial.  
To ensure consistent data with respect to investigator assessment of efficacy (IGA, EASI and 
SCORAD), all investigators will receive training.

THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE LEO PHARMA GROUP  
 
Throughout the trial, data quality review meetings will be held to ensure that data collection 
can be improved and mistakes prevented. During monitoring visits to the t rial sites, the CRAs 
will verify that investigators work according to the protocol.  
Data handling  
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_548893] (for example , laboratory data). The inv estigator or staff authorised 
by [CONTACT_548894] (eCRFs). Data recorded in the 
eCRFs will be accessible to the trial site and LEO Pharma personnel immediately after entry. 
The eCRFs must be maintained in an up -to-date state by [CONTACT_73353].  
The investigator must verify the correctness of the data entered by [CONTACT_547736]. This signature [CONTACT_548912] . Any correction(s) made by [CONTACT_547737]. Changes to data already 
approved will require the re -signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_093]. The person making the change t o 
the data, and the date, time and reason for the change will be identified in the audit trail.  
Subject data should be entered into the eCRF no later than 5  working days after each visit , 
unless a different  deadline is stated in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Queries for discrepant 
data will be generated automatically by [CONTACT_483646] , 
sponsor ’s medical expert,  or the data manager. All queries will be raised electronically within 
the electronic data capture  system. This systematic validation will ensure that a clean and 
consistent database is provided for the statistical analysis.  
An e lectronic PRO (ePRO) solution will be used to  capture patient -reported data  from 
questionnaires completed at the trial site . By [CONTACT_548895], data will be available 
immediately after data entry and available for monitors and site personnel, including the 
investigator, with read er access only.  The ePRO system is a separate application from the 
eCRF , and data captured from the eCRF and the e PRO will be stored on different servers 
during data capture. Data from both systems will be included in the final trial data base.  
Recalled PROs (Worst Weekly Pruritus NRS, Eczema -related Weekly Sleep NRS, and Patient 
use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]) will be recor ded at each site visit and entered in  the eCRF. The 
outcomes will be recorded for the period of 7  days before each site visit (from 6  days prior to 
each visit and including the day of the visit).  
External data transfers from vendors to LEO Pharma will be t ransmitt ed and handled via a 
secure file transfer protocol  site.

Archiving of trial documentation  
The investigator at each trial site must make arrangements to  store the essential trial 
docu ments , including the investigator trial file (in accordance with ICH GCP) . Essential trial 
documents mus t be stored until LEO Pharma informs the investigator that the documents are 
no longer to be retained , or longer if required by [CONTACT_427].  
In addition, the investigator is responsible for the archiving of all relevant source documents 
so that the t rial data can be compared against source data after the completion of the trial ( for 
example  in case of an inspection from regulatory authorities).  
The investigator is required to ensure the continued storage of the documents even if the 
investigator leave s the trial site or retires before the end of the required storage period.

Appendix 3 G: Financial disclosure  
Investigators will provide LEO Pharma  with sufficient, accurate financial information as 
requested to allow LEO Pharma  to submit complete and accurate financial certification or 
disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are responsible 
for providing information on financial interests during the course of the clinical trial and for 
1 year after completion of the clinical trial, or for a longer period of time if required by [CONTACT_71882].  
Appendix 3 H: Trial  and s ite closure  
Premature termination of trial or trial site 
LEO  Pharma , the investigator, the IRB/IECs or competent authorities may decide to stop the 
clinical trial, part of the trial or a trial site at any time, but agreement on procedures to be 
followed must be obtained.  
If a clinical trial is suspended or prematurely ter minated, the investigator must inform the 
subjects promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. As specified by [CONTACT_44536], the investigator or LEO Pharma must promptly inform IRB/IECs 
and provide a detailed written explan ation. Relevant competent authorities must be informed.  
The trial must be terminated if the perception of the benefit/risk ratio (judged from clinical 
signs and symptoms, (S)AEs and/or remarkable safety laboratory changes) becomes 
unfavourable for the cont inuation of the trial.  
Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by [CONTACT_548899]:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, LEO  Pharma procedures, or GCP 
guidelines.  
• Inadequate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_093].  
Completion of trial  
Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is to cease.  Screening activities will 
be stopped at a trial site when the total requested number of subjects for the clinical trial has 
been obtained, irrespective of the specific site ’s planned inclusion number.  
Trial sites will be closed upon trial completion. LEO Pharma will undertake arrangements for 
the collection and disposal of  any unused trial material that the investigator is not required to

Appendix  3K: COVID -19 
Rationale  
The current COVID -19 pandemic warrants many subjects in the ECZTEND trial to stay at 
home to comply with authority -issued preventive measures. This impacts subjects ’ ability  to 
attend site visits in person. To follow authorities ’ restrictions and to safegu ard the subjects in 
the ECZTEND  trial as well as providing continued therapy to secure the scientific integrity, 
this clinical trial protocol a ppendix is installed to provide an opportunity for telephone visits 
and courier delivery of IMP and pregnancy tes ts to subjects  in replacement of the site visits . 
In addition, inclusion criterion [ADDRESS_718389] eligibility  
Inclusion criterion 2 in trial LP0162 -1337 states:  
• Subjects must have completed* the treatment period(s) of one of the parent trials: 
LP0162 -1325, -1326, -1334, -1339,  -1341, -1342, -1343 , -1346 , or TRA -WEI -0015 -I. 
• * To be assessed on the first day of IMP administration (baseline).  
• In trial LP0162 -1334, a  subject is considered to have completed the treatment period , if 
the subject has attended the Week 52 visit on site . 
• In trials LP0162 -[ADDRESS_718390] has attended the Week 16 visit on site. 
• Change to i nclusion criterion 2 in trial LP0162 -1337 d uring  COVID -19 restrictions:  
The change to inclusion criterion [ADDRESS_718391] is 
considered to benefit from continued treatment in trial LP0162 -1337, despi[INVESTIGATOR_548817](s) in the parent trial.

applicable for the sched uled mandatory telephone visits  in protocol version 1 3). This should 
be done in the comments log for each visit. ‘Visit date ’ must also  be documented.  
If the subject is reached by [CONTACT_756], use of emollients, AEs, concomitant medication and 
pregnancy test result (if applicable) must be collected. All other assessments should be 
marked ‘Not done ’ in the eCRF, except for EASI, SCORAD, IGA,  and weight, which should 
be left blank. The log line ‘If not done, specify reason ’ in the assessment form must be 
answered with ‘COVID -19’ as well as the specific reason related to COVID -19, e.g. subject 
cannot visit site due to COVID -[ADDRESS_718393] be entered in the ‘Comments log ’ in the eCRF on subject level.

as a missed visit in the eCRF (“Not done ”). The log line “If not done, specify reason ” must be 
answered with the specific reason related to COVID -19, as above.  
Description of visit scenarios  
It is a requireme nt that all subjects attend the first 3 dosing visits (Visit 3, 4, 5) at the clinic 
according to protocol in order to ensure the [ADDRESS_718394] preferences, the remaining visits can follow 
2 different scenarios as describe d below:  
1) The subject is not restricted from attending visits at the clinic  and continues to follow 
all procedures specified in the protocol.  
2) Subject is not able to attend visits at the clinic, in which case the following procedure 
must be followed:  
a. Site s taff informs subject about the possibility of courier delivery of IMP  and 
pregnancy test, if applicable .

subject ’s medical records).  
c. Site staff allocates IMP for the subject using the EDC system (RA VE®) as per 
protocol.  
d. Site staff sends the following items by a LEO -approved courier company:  
i. Participant Information Sheet for home delivery.  
ii. Log of Drug Administration.  
iii. The appropriate amount of IMP.  
iv. One sharps container, if required.  
v. If required, sanitisers: alcohol wipes, cotton balls or gauze.  
vi. For female subjects of child -bearing potential: one urine pregnancy test 
kit and Urine Pregnancy Test Instructi on. 
e. Site staff contacts the subject (by [CONTACT_756]) and ensures the following:  
i. The Participant Information Sheet has been read, is understood and 
agreed to.  
ii. Subject is asked about concomitant medication use, concomitant 
procedures, adverse events, and pregn ancy test outcome according to 
the original schedule of trial procedures.  
f. Site staff documents all the above in the subject ’s medical record at the clinic.  
g. Site staff enters all available information into the EDC system (RA VE®), see 
above Section “eCRF rec ording ”. 
Home use of IMP  
Injections of tralokinumab  
Self-injection of tralokinumab is described in the protocol and does not change with this 
appendix . 
Subjects who miss one or more doses need to have the missed doses documented in the eCRF 
with specific r eason related to COVID -19 written in the comments log for each visit in scope.

Appendix  6: Guidance for anaphylaxis diagnosis  
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network Guidance for Anaphylaxis Diagnosis (FAAN) define anaphylaxis as a 
serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. They recognis e 
3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria designated to capture from 80% of cases 
(category  1) to >95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories).  
Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1) Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g. , generalis ed hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -
tongue -uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOW ING:  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnoea , wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia)  
• Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ 
dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2) Two or  more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):  
• Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g. , generalis ed hives, itch -flush, 
swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g.,  dyspnoea , wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced PEF, hypoxemia)  
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
• Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3) Reduced BP after exposure to  known  allergen for that patient (minutes to several 
hours):  
• Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% 
decrease in systolic BP  
• Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from 
that person ’s baseline

Appendix  8: Protocol amendment history  
The Protocol amendment summary of changes table  for the current amendment is located 
directly before the table of contents.  
Amendment  1 (27 -Jun-2018)  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union 
or subsequent regulation.  
Overall rationale for the amendment:  
The main  reason for this amendment is to change an inclusion criterion that will enable all 
eligible subjects to enter this trial directly after completing the treatment period(s) in their 
parent trial. The scientific rationale for this change is given in the tabl e below.  
In addition, the amendment includes other changes, as presented in the table below.  
Note:  The table below describes the changes in each section, either summarised (in plain text) 
or marked as tracked changes (text deleted has a line through it ).

 If the screening period does not exceed a 
duration of 2 weeks, a single screening visit 
should preferably be performed combining the 
assessments specified for Visits 1 and 2. If the 
screening period exceeds a duration of 2  weeks 
(+7 days), the screening will consist of 2 
separate visits (Visits 1 and 2).  For subjects who 
do no t require a washout, visits 1 and 2 will be 
combined and screening will be reduced to 2 
weeks; hence, these subjects will only attend visit 
2 (Week  2) which will include all assessments 
shown under Week 4.   To clarify that the duration of 
screening is no longer 
dependent on the need for

7.1 Overall 
trial design  The screening period has a duration of 2 to 
4 weeks and includes 1  or 2 screening visits 
(Visits 1 and 2) . The exact duration of the 
screening  period for the individual subject 
depends on the length of any washout period 
needed, as specified in the exclusion criteria in 
Section  8.3 (that is, 4  weeks prior to Week  0

immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs, 
systemic corticosteroid use; and 2  weeks prior to 
baseline for topi[INVESTIGATOR_22724]  4 [PDE -4]

assessments should be adhered to, working in 
parallel for both protocols. Assessments where 
data are captured in different vendor systems 
databases (ECG, ePRO and laboratory tests) need 
to be completed twice. In such cases, the parent 
trial assessment should be performed first, 
followed by [CONTACT_548842]0162 -[ADDRESS_718445] identification number (subject ID) will be

who are health care

sufficiently qualified for 
performing subcutaneous 
injections and do not need

In Japan, the order of assessments may be

safety and laboratory assessments before the 
investigator assessments but after the PROs. 
The assessments must be performed in the 
same order for all subjects at the site.  As the standard clinical 
procedure in Japan is to 
perform safety and laboratory 
assessments before subjects 
meet the principal investigator, 
a country -specific requirement 
has been added to allow this

Amendment 5 (24 -Jun-2019)  
This amendment is considered to be non -substantial based on the criteria set forth in 
Article  10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the  Council of the 
European Union because it neither significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental 
integrity of participants nor the scientific value of the trial.  
Overall rationale for the amendment:  
The main reason for this amendment is to correct an error in the schedule of trial  procedures 
introduced with amendment 4.

Amendment 6 (17 -Feb-2020)  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article  10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
As protocol version 7.0 was made obsolete prior to the effective date, this amendment

The main reason for the amendment is to introduce the possibility  for eligible subjects in 
selected countries of trial LP0162 -1334 with adolescent subjects to continue in this long -term 
extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND). The purpose is to obtain long -term safety data for 
adolescent subjects with atopic dermatitis ( AD) treated with tralokinumab.

Amendment  7 (25 -Nov-2020)  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article  10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Overall rationale for the amendment:  
The main reason for this amendme nt is to extend the collection of long -term safety data for 
tralokinumab up to [ADDRESS_718481] the opportunity to continue 
for an additional 1 -year extension, providing an additional year of safety data for 
adolescents/young adults. To reduce the burden of frequent site visits for subjects , the 
amendment will introduce a visit schedule more similar to standard practice for home use. 
The modified design reduces the number of site  visits and instead introduces a mandatory 
telephone visit in between site visits to ensure close safety monitorin g of the subjects.  
This amendment also introduces the possibility for eligible subjects from 2 new parent trials, 
LP0162 -1343 and TRA -WEI -0015 -I, to participate  in this long -term extension trial.

endpoints  An analysis has been added:   
As the frequency of site visits is reduced

excluding data captured after May 2021 
will be performed for the ‘proportion of 
time’ endpoints.  Sensitivity analysis added as the 
less frequent assessment of

assessment at both Week 80 and Week 
88, the Week 80 assessment

years) will be used for the  Week 80 -88 
endpoint evaluation. Likewise, the Week 
128 assessment (~ 2½ years) will be 
prioritised for the Week 128 -136 
endpoint evaluation.  
Changes from baseline will not be 
presented for subjects from the parent 
trial TRA -WEI -0015 -I, since data from

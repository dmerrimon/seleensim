 5 PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  AND  RESEARCH  SUMMARY  
Purpose  
To examine oncolytic poliovirus (OncPV) bioactivity in tumor tissue after intratumoral 
administration  of PVSRIPO  (Polio/Rhinovirus  Recombinant)  in women  with invasive  breast 
cancer.  
 
Objectives  (Exploratory) : 
To investigate PVSRIPO -mediated inflammation and immunity in women with stage II -IV 
invasive breast cancer.  
1. Primary Exploratory Objective : To describe the change in the amount of tumor 
infiltrating  immune  cells in tumor  tissue  pre- and post-injection  of PVSRIPO  by H&E 
(Hemotoxylin and Eosin).  
2. Other  Exploratory  Objectives : 
a. To examine  tumor  tissue  pre- and post-injection  of PVSRIPO  for inflammatory 
and immune signatures using arrays, CD155 expression by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC), immune cell infiltrate by [CONTACT_62021] (post -injection only).  
b. To examine blood for inflammatory and immune sign ature using arrays, 
immune  cell composition  (antigen  presenting  cells,  B cells and T cells),  T cell 
activation  by [CONTACT_62022] B cell activation  by [CONTACT_62023]. 
Blood will be collected on day -7 (range day -7 to -10, before polio vaccine  
booster), day 0 (before PVSRIPO injection), day 2 (range day 1 to 2 after 
PVSRIPO), day 14 (range day 10 to 20, after PVSRIPO before surgery) and 
in follow -up at months 1 (± 10 days) and 6 (± 1 month) post -PVSRIPO.  
 
Hypothesis  
Administration of oncolytic poliovirus, PVSRIPO, in the tumor causes inflammation, which 
stimulates innate and adaptive immune activation, in invasive breast cancer.  
 
Background  and Significance  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the [LOCATION_002], with an estimated  
246,660  new diagnoses  in 2016,  and is the second  leading  cause  of cancer  death  in 
women,  with an estimated  40,450  women  in the United  States  dying  from the disease  in 
2016  (1). Breast  cancer  is a heterogeneous  disease  comprising  several  molecular  
subtypes, based on receptor status, specifically the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone 
receptor  (PR),  and human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_61977]  2-neu (HER2)  receptor.  These receptors  
are both prognostic  but also predictive  of response  to targeted  therapy.  
 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer or TNBC (negative for ER, PR, and HER2) represents 15 - 
20% of all breast tumors and has the poorest prognosis, with an earlier  age of diagnosis, 
higher rate of local recurrence and distant metastases, and an elevated 5 -yr mortality rate 
compared  to ER positive  cancers  (Breast  Cancer  Facts  and Figures,  2015 -2016,  American 
Cancer Society). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_61978].  In several  phase  I trials  targeting  the immune  

 
 checkpoint PD -1/PD -L1, cancer immunotherapy  has been shown to demonstrate some 
promise in TNBC by [CONTACT_62024].  
 
PVSRIPO is a recombinant polio:rhinovirus chimera, engineered to eliminate neuronal 
competence  and is devoid  of neuropathogenicity  upon  inoculation  in primates  and humans. 
PVSRIPO specifically targets and destroys tumor cells and initiates innate and adaptive 
immune  events  in the host.  PVSRIPO  has demonstrated  promise  in a phase  I study  at Duke 
University  in patient s with recurrent  WHO  Grade  [ADDRESS_66869] cancer 
following intratumoral injection. The endpoints are explorator y and will guide design of a 
phase I/II study of PVSRIPO and combinations of PVSRIPO with immune checkpoint 
blockade  (for example  PD-1/PD -L1) in women  with breast  cancer.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_61979] a grant from the Department of Defense (DoD) entitled “Regional oncolytic poliovirus 
immunotherapy for breast cancer” (Principal Investigator, Smita Nair, Ph.D.).  
 
Although we plan to target the TNBC population as the intended population for this  novel 
therapeutic,  for this feasibility  study  we will broaden  the eligibility  criteria  to include  all tumor 
subtypes, as there is no biologic rationale to support differing toxicities from different 
invasive breast cancer subtypes. After safety is confirm ed in this feasibility study, we will 
focus our efforts on the intended TNBC population.  
 
 
Design  and Procedure  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_61980] -mediated intratumoral bioactivity, 
inflammation,  and immune  events  in women  with invasive  breast  cancer.  Enrollment  target 
will include  six women  with invasive  breast  cancer.  Women  with stage  II-IV invasive  breast 
cancer  with at least  [ADDRESS_66870] 
of care surgery will be eligible.  
 
Polio vaccine booster will be administered 1 week, or up to 10 days, prior to PVSRIPO 
injection. On day 0, after pr etreatment biopsy is obtained, 1x108 TCID 50 (tissue culture 
infectious  dose)  of PVSRIPO  will be injected  into the tumor  mass.  On day 14 (range  10-20 
days),  women  will undergo  standard -of-care (SOC)  surgical  resection  of PVSRIPO -treated 
tumor.  Women  will have  follow -up at 1-2 days  after PVSRIPO  injection,  1 month  (± 10 days) 
and 6 months (± 1 month) after PVSRIPO for adverse events, disease status, and whole 
blood draw for research purposes.  
 
Women will undergo a pre -treatment core needle biopsy with collection of research cores 
of tumor tissue prior to intratumoral injection of PVSRIPO. Ten to twenty days after 
PVSRIPO injection, tumor tissue will be collected at the time of SOC surgical tumor 
resection. The surgically res ected tissue will be collected and processed as fresh and 
formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE)  tissue. The tissue will  be used to  evaluate tumor  

 
 infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs),  CD155  expression,  and inflammatory  and immune  signature 
[CONTACT_62069]. Any subjects who do not have evaluable tumor tissue from both the pre - 
treatment biopsy and post -treatment surgery will be replaced.  
 
Additionally,  inflammatory  and immune  analysis  will be conducted  using  blood  obtained  on 
day -7 (range day -7 to -10, before polio vaccine booster), day 0 (before PVSRIPO 
injection), day 2 to 5 (range day 1 -2 after PVSRIPO), day 14 (range day 10 to 20 after 
PVSRIPO, which is before surgery) and in follow -up at months 1 (± 10 days) and 6 (± 1 
month) aft er PVSRIPO. Blood will be analyzed for inflammatory and immune signature 
[CONTACT_62070],  immune  cell composition  (antigen  presenting  cells,  B cells and T cells),  T cell 
activation by [CONTACT_62025] B cell activation by [CONTACT_62026]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t 
study will enable a phase I/II study of PVSRIPO and combinations of PVSRIPO with 
immune checkpoint blockade (for example PD -1/PD -L1) in women with advanced breast 
cancer.

and changes in T cell activation in blood. As such, the correlative studies and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_61982] 1 of the funded  DoD grant  application  entitled  “Regional 
oncolytic poliovirus immunotherapy for breast cancer” (Principal  Investigator, Smita Nair, 
Ph.D.).  
 
 
[ADDRESS_66875]  common  cancer  in women,  with an estimated  246,660  new 
diagnoses  in 2016,  and is the second  leading  cause  of cancer  death  in women,  with an 
estimated  40,450  women  in the United  States  dying  from the disease  in 2016  (1). Breast 
cancer  is a heterogeneous  disease  comprising  several  molecular  subtypes,  based  on 
receptor status, specifically the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and 
human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_61977]  2-neu (HER2)  receptor.  These  receptors  are both 
prognostic  but also  predictive of response to  targeted therapy.  Altho ugh often curable when 
localized to the breast and lymph nodes, on the whole, breast cancer remains incurable for 
most women in  the metastatic  setting ( 2). An  estimated  20% to 30% of women  diagnosed 
with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease 
(Department of Defense (DoD) Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP), “The Breast  
Cancer Landscape”).  
 
Triple Negative Breast  Cancer  (TNBC)  refers  to tumors  lacking  the expression  of estrogen 
receptor  (ER),  progesterone  receptor  (PR),  and the human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_61983] 
2 (HER2)  and portends  a poor prognosis  compared  with tumors  expressing  these  receptors. 
These  tumors  account  for about  15% of all breast  cancers  and have  been  shown  to be more 
aggressive  than other  tumor subtypes.  These  women are  diagnosed  at an earlier  age 
and have a higher risk of local and distant recurrence ( 3). The higher risk of distant 
metastases results in an elevated 5 -year mortality rate compared to ER positive cancers 
(4). In addition, the paucity of targeted treatment available for TNBC likely contributes to 
the lower survival rate. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_61984], standard criteri a are used to select the approach to local therapy as more 
extensive surgeries have not been shown to improve survival ( 3). At the time of distant 
recurrence, there are no standard of care approaches for systemic chemotherapy. 
Common  chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_61985] d in the neoadjuvant,  adjuvant,  and metastatic 
setting  for invasive  breast  cancers  include anthracyclines,  cyclophosphamide, 
taxanes, capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbine, and platinums. In addition to these 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], common anti -HER2 treatments used in HER2+ breast cancer include 
trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T -DM1, and lapatinib.  
 
Immunotherapy has been demonstrated to mediate regression of large bulky tumors in  
the stage IV setting in multiple clinical settings, resulting in improved overall and disease 
free survival  in melanoma  and non-small  cell lung cancer,  as well as promising 
objective  response rates in head and neck, gastric, and urothelial cancers ( 5-10). The 
presence  of tumor  infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs)  correlates  with a favorable 
prognosis  in various  malignancies  including  TNBC  (11). Several  phase  I/II clinical 
trials targeting the immune checkpoint PD -1/PD -L1 pathways in metastatic TNBC have 
shown promising results with overall response rates of 18 -20% ( 9, 12). 
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_61986].  The endpoints  are exploratory  and will guide  a phase  I/ 
II study  of PVSRIPO and combinations of PVSRIPO with immune checkpoint blockade in 
women with breast cancer. Although we plan to target the TNBC population as the 
intended population  

 
 for this novel therapeutic, for this feasibility study we will broaden the eligibility criteria to 
include all tumor subtypes, as there is no biologic rationale to support differing toxicities 
from different invasive breast cancer subtypes. After safety is confirmed in this feasibility 
study we will focus our efforts on the i ntended TNBC population.  
 
Study  Agent  
PVSRIPO is the live attenuated, oral (Sabin) serotype 1 poliovirus vaccine containing a 
heterologous  internal  ribosomal  entry  site (IRES)  derived  from the human  rhinovirus  type 2 
(HRV2).  Poliovirus  receptor  is mediate d by [CONTACT_62027],  CD155,  an oncofetal  cell 
adhesion molecule, which is widely expressed ectopi[INVESTIGATOR_61987], e.g. invasive 
breast cancer. Tumor specificity is mediated by [CONTACT_62028]155 in invasive 
breast cancer. Translation is repressed at the heterologous HRV2 IRES in no rmal breast 
tissue and a supportive environment for PVSRIPO translation, growth, and cytotoxicity is 
mediated by [CONTACT_62029] C (PKC) -Ras-Erk signaling to translation 
machinery in cancers. PVSRIPO is administered intratumorally. Since PVSRIPO is a 
version  of the serotype  1 live-attenuated  (Sabin)  poliovirus  vaccine  (PV1),  its immunogenic 
properties and potential for long -term sequelae are expected to be similar.  Poliovirus 
serotype 1 (SABIN) (PV1S) has been safely administered to >[ADDRESS_66876] long -term immunogenic sequelae. The pre -clinical data 
described below was included in the funded DoD grant application to provide rationale for 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
7.2.1  Pre-Clinical  Experience  
For details about the pre -clinical experience with PVSRIPO, please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure for PVSRIPO.  
 
PVSRIPO tumor tropi[INVESTIGATOR_8801]:  PVSRIPO has natural cancer tropi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], due to widespread 
ectopic  expression  of the poliovirus  receptor  (PVR)  CD155  in solid cancers,  where  it 
may serve  as a tumor  immune  evasion  strategy  (13-17). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_61988],  PVSRIPO  is highly  cytotoxic  in neoplastic  cells ( 17). PVSRIPO’s oncolytic 
efficacy depends on  ectopic  CD155  expression  and unhinged  MAPK -signals to 
translation  machinery.  Both properties  define  most  malignancies,  including  breast 
cancer.  Efficient  tumor  tropi[INVESTIGATOR_61989],  violent  cytotoxicity  distinguish  PVSRIPO 
from other oncolytic viruses. PVSRIPO uniquely has oncolytic efficacy desp ite pre - 
existing  neutralizing  antibodies  and viral cell killing  proceeds  in the presence  of an 
active innate antiviral response ( 18, 19). 
 
Figure 2A depi[INVESTIGATOR_61990]155 expression on breast cancer cell lines and primary breast  
tumor tissue ( 20) (de -identified primary tissue was used and the sub -type of primary  
tumor tissue was not determined). Note that CD155 is not expressed on normal breast 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_61991] (S2N).  PVSRIPO  exhibits  anti-tumor  activity  in breast  cancer  models 
of brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease, which are notoriously refractory to 
therapy ( 20) (Figure 2B ). Figure [ADDRESS_66877]  cancer  tissues  by [CONTACT_62030]. B. PVSRIPO  efficacy  in vivo. Rats (n=10)  with 
intrathecal xenografts were treated once  with PVSRIPO at 1x107 pfu (open triangles) or 1x109 pfu 
(closed squares), 3 days after tumor implant. UV -inactivated PVSRIPO was used as control (closed 
diamonds).

expression  scoring, etc. see Chandramohan et al. (21). The table summarizes expression 
scores  in the 19 cases. The numbered panels show IHC results for the corresponding cases 
in the table. Size bars represent 1 mm (7, 14) or 100 mm (4, 8, 10, 17).  
 
Molecular mechanisms of PVSRIPO tumor specificity: PVSRIPO targets constitutively 
active  Raf-Erk1/2  signal  transduction  to translation  machinery  via Erk1/2  to downstream  

 
 MAPK -interacting  kinases  and to eIF4G  to generate  conditions  that favor  5’ 
methyl -7- guanidine cap -independent, IRES -mediated translation ( 22-24). The Raf -Erk1/[ADDRESS_66879] is a central gene regulatory node in malignancy that is recalcitrant to small - 
molecule inhibitors, due to drug resistance mechanisms that restore Erk1/[ADDRESS_66880]  cancer  (25). PVSRIPO  oncolysis  depends on active 
Raf-Erk1/[ADDRESS_66881] PVSRIPO  infection  (26). The TNBC  cell line MDA - 
MB231  and the triple -negative inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) cell line SUM149, are 
susceptible to PVSRIPO -mediated lysis and express CD155 ( Figure 4 ). Lethal  
PVSRIPO -mediated cy totoxicity results in the loss of intact eIF4G and the generation of 
the eIF4G cleavage product ( Figure 4A ) (27). 
 
Figure  4. PVSRIPO  Cytotoxicity  in Breast  Cancer  Cell Lines.  Breast  cancer  cell lines,  MDA - 
MB231 and SUM149, were infected at multiplicity of Infection (MOIs) of 0.1 or 10 with 
PVSRIPO. A. Lysates were collected at the denoted intervals and tested by [CONTACT_62031] (eIF4G cleavage), host cell demise (PARP cleav age), viral 
replication (viral proteins P2/2BC/2C), and antiviral responses (p -eIF2α(S51)/IFIT1/ISG15). 
Loss of cellular proteins (e.g. tubulin) and viral protein at later time  points correlates with lysis 
of infected cells. B. Cells were infected at an MO I of 0.[ADDRESS_66882] infection 
(hpi) for analysis  of MHC  class  I and CD155  expression  by [CONTACT_4133]  (light  grey,  uninfected 
cells stained with isotype control; dark grey, uninfected cells stained for MHC or CD155; and 
red, infected cells  stained for MHC or CD155).  
 
PVSRIPO activates dendritic cells : PVSRIPO oncolysis releases tumor antigens and 
generates DAMPs and PAMPs (damage -associated and pathogen -associated molecular 
patterns) that stimulates immune cells ( 28). Poliovirus RNA is a cl assic PAMP that 
engages cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors and downstream responses (Mda5 - 
Stat1 -IFN/) in immune cells.  Poliovirus  naturally targets antigen presenting cells 
(APCs), such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), via CD 155. To 
delineate the effects of PVSRIPO on DCs, we examined markers of cytotoxicity and 
activation status  on antigen presentation.  DCs infected with PVSRIPO at MOI of 1, 10, 
and 100 did not exhibit lytic  

 
 cytoxicity as compared to lytic cytot oxicity in cancer cells infected with PVSRIPO ( Figure 
5A). Viral propagation  was detected,  however,  in sharp  contrast  to cancer  cells,  did 
not yield progeny  beyond  background  levels  (Figure  5A) (29). An increase  in 
Stat1  phosphorylation (which leads to increased Stat1 total protein) followed by [CONTACT_62032] (IFN) -stimulated genes ISG15, IFIT1, and MDA5 protein, signify 
the activation of  type-I IFN responses  (Figure  5B) (27). Inefficient  cleavage  of eIF4G 
and PARP  and decreased 2C expression following infection, suggests severe limitations 
on viral replication and  cytotoxicity.  This is in sharp  contrast  to what  we observe  in 
tumor  cells treated  with PVSRIPO  (Figure  4). In animal  tumor  models,  there  is 
histologic evidence for virus -mediated tumor cell killing and indirect host -mediated 
inflammatory  responses  focused against tumor ( 24, 30-33). 
 
Figure  5. Infection  and Activation  of Dendritic  Cells  (DCs)  by [CONTACT_62020].  Human  monocyte - 
derived DCs were infected with PVSRIPO at MOI of 1, 10, and 100. A. LDH-release assay 
(top) and viral  progeny  (bottom)  analysis was  conducted  using  infected DCs  and compared to 
infected DM6/MDA -MB231 cells. B. Western blot analysis was conducted at the designated 
time points post infection (PI). PVSRIPO viral protein (2C) detection signifies productive 
infection. An increase in Stat1 phosphorylation (which leads to increased Stat1 total protein) 
followed  by [CONTACT_62033]-stimulated  genes  ISG15,  IFIT1,  and MDA5  protein,  signify 
activation of IFN responses. Inefficient cleavage of eIF4G and PARP and decreased 2C 
expression  following  infection, suggests  severe limitations  on viral  replication  and cytotoxicity.  
 
To examine if presence of PAMP s and DAMPs in PVSRIPO oncolysate activates DCs, 
tumor lysates were collected after exposing tumor cells to mock - or PVSRIPO -infection 
(MOI  = 0.1; 48h) and treating  human  monocyte -derived  DCs with the resulting 
oncolysate ( Figure 6 ) (27). To control for the effects of infectious PVSRIPO particles 
present  in the oncolysate on DCs (~5x108 pfu/mL), virus was removed using a 100kD 
filter.  This approach  removes all infectious virus but does not remove IFN/dsRNA/HMGB1 
or other conceivable PAMP s/DAMPs. Exposure to oncolysate increased DC co - 
stimulatory molecule expression  

 
 and other  markers  of DC activation  (Figure  6B). This effect  was mitigated  by 
100kD filtration, suggesting that PVSRIPO infection may actively participate in DC 
activation ( 27). 
 
Figure 6. PVSRIPO -Induced Oncolysate Causes DC Activation in a Virus Dependent 
Fashion. A. Outline of in vitro human DC activation experiment. B. PVSRIPO -induced tumor 
lysate (PVSRIPO oncolysate)  activates  human DCs. DCs  were generated ( 34) from HLA -A2+ 
donor cells. Supernatant from untreated or PVSRIPO -infected (MOI = 0.1; 48hpi) tumor cells 
were either unfiltered or filtered through a [ADDRESS_66883]  immature  DCs (iDCs ) or DCs matured  in cytokine  cocktail 
(mDCs ) were used as controls. Flow cytometry was used to assess DC activation/maturation 
phenotype  and viability.  This experiment  was repeated  twice  and representative  data is shown.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_66884]  recurrent  WHO  Grade  4 malignant  glioma 
PVSRIPO has been tested in a phase I study in subjects with recurrent WHO Grade 4 
malignant glioma and has generated a durable clinical response in approximately 20% of 
patients. These responses occurred despi[INVESTIGATOR_61992],  cranial  radiation  therapy,  chemotherapy  (temozolomide,  TMZ),  and (sometimes) 
bevacizumab. Fifteen patients were enrolled into the PVSRIPO dose -escalation portion of 
this phase I study. Dose was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_61993] 1x108 TCID 50 (dose level 1)  to 1x1010 
TCID 50 (dose level 5) after which dose was reduced due to long -term steroid or 
bevacizumab therapy to control inflammatory reaction secondary to PVSRIPO -mediated 
immune  response.  For more  information  about  the clinical  findings  of PVSRIPO,  refer to the 
Investigator’s  Brochure  for PVSRIPO.  Based  on the original  dose  finding  and safety  study 
in patients with recurrent malignant glioma (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]; 
Duke IRB Pro00031169), we will use 1x108 TCID 50 (dose level 1) in women with invasive 
breast cancer.  
We have  chosen  to use 1x108 TCID 50 (dose  level 1 from the phase  1 dose -escalation  study 
in patients with recurrent WHO Grade 4 malignant glioma) for the following reasons.  
1. In the dose escalation study conducted in patients with malignant glioma, patient 1 
received dose level 1, 1x108 TCID 50. This patient responded favorably to PVSRIPO 
therapy  and was disease -free 60+ months  after receiving  a single  intratumoral  injection  

 
 of PVSRIPO.  
2. Brain  inflammation  in the area of the tumor  or immediately  adjacent  was the main  toxicity 
associated with intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO and the primary reason for dose 
reduction in the phase I brain tumor study and use of dose level -1 (5 x 107 TCID 50) in 
the Phase [ADDRESS_66885] is not in a physiologically 
confined space (like brain in the cranium) the effects of inflammation due to PVSRIPO 
are not of significant clinical impact. Additionally, the breast tumor will be re sected 10 - 
20 days  following  PVSRIPO  infusion  therefore  limiting  the time in which  the patient  may 
experience discomfort from tumor site hyper -inflammation.  
3. A higher  dose  is warranted  in this setting  given  that there  may be some  systemic  leakage 
upon injection, therefore requiring an overall higher dose to ensure that a substantial 
amount of the PVSRIPO remains in the tumor. We will therefore start with dose level 1 
(1x108 TCID 50) from the phase 1 recurrent WHO Grade 4 malignant glioma stu dy, to 
ensure  that we elicit a response  in tumor  (both  tumor  killing  and immune  consequences) 
post-PVSRIPO in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
Study  Purpose  and Rationale  
PVSRIPO, a recombinant oncolytic poliovirus, has shown promising results in recurrent 
malignant  glioma  when  administered  intracerebrally.  Once  administered,  PVSRIPO  enters 
tumor cells through the poliovirus receptor CD155, which is overexpressed in solid 
malignancies.  As such,  it both specifically  targets  and destroys  tumor  cells that it enters  and 
initiates innate and adaptive immune events in the host.  
 
A phase I clinical trial of PVSRIPO in recurrent malignant glioma patients has yielded 
durable  complete  radiographic  and clinical  responses  with a proportion  of patients  achieving 
prolonged disease survival up to 61+ months. The first subject treated with PVSRIPO is 
alive and well 5 years  after PVSRIPO  administration.  PVSRIPO  was granted  Breakthrough 
Therapy Designation by [CONTACT_8415]/CBER on May 16th, 2016.  
 
As CD155 is also overexpressed in all subtypes of invasive breast cancer, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_61994] [ADDRESS_66886]. Importantly, if effective, this will lead to a phase I/II trial of 
PVSRIPO and combinations of PVSRIPO with immune checkpoint blockade (for example 
PD-1/PD -L1) in women with triple negative breast cancer. Of note, PD -1/PD -L1 blockade 
has already demonstrated some clinical efficacy in women with TNBC.  
 
Rationale:  The rationale  for doing  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_61995]:  
1. To characterize  intratumoral  PVSRIPO  injection  in a non-CNS  cancer  
2. To investigate  inflammation  and immunity  in tumor  tissue  post-PVSRIPO  treatment. 
PVSRIPO treatment is showing promise in malignant glioma patients but the tumor 
tissue is not accessible to examine PVSRIPO bioactivity. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_61996].  
3. To demonstrate that post -transcriptional gene regulatory principles that mediate 
PVSRIPO tumor cytotoxicity apply to breast cancer.  

 
 8 OBJECTIVES  AND  ENDPOINTS  
To examine oncolytic poliovirus (OncPV) bioactivity in tumor tissue after intratumoral 
administration of PVSRIPO in women with invasive breast cancer.  
 
Objectives  (Exploratory) : 
To investigate PVSRIPO -mediated inflammation and immunity in women with stage II-IV 
invasive breast cancer.  
1. Primary Exploratory Objective : To describe the change in the amount of tumor 
infiltrating  immune  cells in tumor  tissue  pre- and post-injection  of PVSRIPO  by H&E 
(Haemotoxylin and Eosin).  
2. Other  Exploratory  Objectives : 
a. To examine  tumor  tissue  pre- and post-injection  of PVSRIPO  for inflammatory 
and immune signature [CONTACT_62069], CD155 expression by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC), immune cell infiltrate by [CONTACT_62021] (post -injection only).  
b. To examine blood for inflammatory and immune signa ture using arrays, 
immune  cell composition  (antigen  presenting  cells,  B cells and T cells),  T cell 
activation  by [CONTACT_62022] B cell activation  by [CONTACT_62023]. 
Blood will be collected on day -7 (range day -7 to -10, before polio vaccine 
booster), day 0 (before PVSRIPO injection), day 2 (range day 1 -2 after 
PVSRIPO), day 14 (range day 10 to 20, after PVSRIPO before surgery) and 
in follow -up at months 1 (± 10 days, after PVSRIPO) and 6 (± 1 month, after 
PVSRIPO).  
 
Hypothesis  
Administration of oncolytic poliovirus, PVSRIPO, in the tumor causes inflammation, which 
stimulates innate and adaptive immune activation, in invasive breast cancer.  
 
[ADDRESS_66887] 2 weeks  (ideal 3 -4 
weeks) after the last dose of chemotherapy or steroids to administer the polio vaccine 
booster.  PVSRIPO  will be injected  into the tumor  mass  at 1x108 TCID 50 7-10 days  after polio 
vaccine booster is administered.  
 
Biopsy  material  will be obtaine d from tumor  tissue  immediately  prior to virus  administration 
and resected tumor  tissue will  be obtained  at 10-20 days (ideally  12-16) after PVSRIPO at 
the time of surgical resection. The PVSRIPO -treated tumor tissue will be transported to 
Surgical Pathology by [CONTACT_62034] (BTBR) Team, as directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Roger McLendon, MD or per clinical protocol, for gross examination and re search tissue 
procurement, thereby [CONTACT_62035] -guarding the diagnostic integrity of the specimen. Additional 
expertise  in breast  pathology  will be provided  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Edgardo  Parilla  Castella,  MD, PhD.  

 
 Tissue deemed appropriate for collection (i.e. wast eful excess and of no diagnostic value) 
will be collected  by [CONTACT_62036]  (BTBR)  Team,  as directed  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Smita 
Nair, PhD, and transported to her lab for correlative molecular and immune analyses. Our 
primary  objective  is to determine  chan ge in the amount  of tumor  infiltrating  immune  cells in 
tumor tissue pre - and post -injection of PVSRIPO by H&E. We will also evaluate 
inflammatory and immune signatures using inflammatory and innate/adaptive arrays, 
CD155 expression and immune cell infiltrate by [CONTACT_62037] (post -injection only).  
 
Additionally,  inflammatory  and immune  analysis  will be conducted  using  blood  obtained  on 
day -7 (range day -7 to -10, before polio vaccine booster), day 0 (before PVSRIPO 
injection), day 1 -2 (after PVSRIPO), day 14 (range day 10 to 20 after PVSRIPO, which is 
before  surgery),  and in follow -up at months  1 (± 10 days)  and 6 (± 1 month)  after PVSRIPO. 
Blood will be analyzed for inflammatory and immune signature [CONTACT_62069], immune cell 
composition  (antigen  presenting  cells,  B cells and T cells),  T cell activation  by [CONTACT_62038] B cell activation by [CONTACT_62026]. Immune cell composition and T cell 
activation in blood will be done using DuraClone IM panels from Beckman Coulter.

9.2.3  Poliomyelitis  
PVSRIPO has been tested in non -human primates (NHPs) according to the WHO 
standardized monkey neurovirulence tests. These tests reveale d the absence of 
neuropathogenic properties, evident as failure to induce symptoms of poliomyelitis in 
NHPs after intracerebral inoculation of virus. In addition, the use of intracerebral 
PVSRIPO in human subjects with recurrent malignant glioma in phase I  trials have not 
induced  symptoms  of poliomyelitis.  However,  PVSRIPO  are replication -competent  viral 
agents that, in principle, retain the potential to cause motor neuron damage. Possible 
complications include transient or permanent  mono - or paraparesis, p aralysis, and life -

9.2.[ADDRESS_66891]  not been  performed.  Since 
the overall risk classification of this research is unknown we plan to take the following 
approaches to ensure patient safety:  
I. We will stagger enrollment of each patient by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_66892] any Grade 3 or any 
Grade 4 toxicity that is  not reversible within 2 weeks after surgery (~24 -34 days 
after PVSRIPO, depending on when the surgery is performed), or any life - 
threatening  event,  or treatment -related  death  will be considered  an unacceptable 
toxicity. Any grade 2 or higher serious auto immune toxicities particularly those 
affecting vital organs (e.g. cardiac, renal, CNS) will be considered an 
unacceptable toxicity. Also, the study will be paused to enrollment if a patient 
death  occurs  within  a month  after PVSRIPO  injection  possibly  or likely  related  to 
PVSRIPO.  
 
Rationale for Selection of Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Duration 
The dose of PVSRIPO for this trial was selected based on IND -directed toxicity studies 
and on experience  from a  phase  I study  in adults  with recurrent  WHO  grade  IV malignant 
glioma. For more information on the results from the dose -finding study, please refer to 
the Investigator’s Brochure for PVSRIPO.  
 
We have chosen to use 1x108 TCID 50 (dose level 1 from phase 1 dose -finding malignant 
glioma trial) f or the following reasons.  
1. In the dose escalation study conducted in patients with recurrent malignant glioma, 
patient 1 received dose level 1, 1x108 TCID 50. This patient responded favorably to 
PVSRIPO therapy and was disease -free 60+ months after receiving a single 
intratumoral injection of PVSRIPO.  
2. Brain  inflammation  in the area of the tumor  or immediately  adjacent  was the main  toxicity 
associated with intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO and the p rimary reason for dose 
reduction  in the phase  I brain  tumor  study.  Because  of this, dose  level -1 (5 x 107 TCID 50) 
is being  investigated  in the phase  [ADDRESS_66893] is not in a physiologically 
confined space (like brain in the cranium) the effects of inflammation due to PVSRIPO 
are not of significant clinic al impact. Additionally, the breast tumor will be resected [ADDRESS_66894] cancer setting given that there may be some 
systemic leakage upon injection, therefore requiring an overall higher dose to ensure 
that a substantial amount  of the PVSRIPO  remains  in the tumor.  We will therefore  start 
with dose level 1 (1x108 TCID 50) from the phase 1 malignant glioma study, to ensure 
that we elicit a response in tumor (both tumor killing and immune consequences) post - 
PVSRIPO in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].

Early  Study  Termination  
This study  can be terminated  at any time for any reason  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_27362].  If this occurs, 
all subjects on study will be notified as soon as possible. Additional procedures and/or

10 STUDY  DRUG  
Names,  Classification,  and Mechanism  of Action  
PVSRIPO  is the live attenuated  poliovirus  (PV) serotype  1 (SABIN)  vaccine  with its internal 
ribosomal entry site (IRES) element replaced with that of human rhinovirus type 2. IRES 
exchange causes an inability of PVSR IPO to drive translation of its genome in normal  
cells ( 35, 36). Thus, PVSRIPO is devoid of neuropathogenicity after high -dose 
intracerebral  inoculation in non -human primates ( 13) and in humans. Because PVSRIPO 
is a version of the serotype 1 live -attenuate d (Sabin) poliovirus vaccine (PV1), its 
immunogenic  properties  and potential  for long-term sequelae  are expected  to be 
similar. PV1S has been safely administered to >[ADDRESS_66896] of 
administration  of PV1S  to human  subjects  is neutralizing immunity to poliovirus.  
 
Supply,  Receipt,  and Storage  
PVSRIPO is  formulated in 50  mM sodium phosphate in  0.9%  sodium chloride, pH 7.4 with 
0.2%  human  serum  albumin.  It is provided  in sterile,  single  use containers.  PVSRIPO  must 
be stored at less than or equal to -70°C. Once thawed, it is a clear colorless liquid with no 
evidence of particulates or foreign matter. The PVSRIPO being utilized in this study was 
manufactured at the Biopharmaceutical Development Program/National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) -Frederick.  
 
Dispensing  and Preparation  
The study  agent  and vehicle  will be supplied  to the Investigational  Pharmacy  by [CONTACT_62039]. The study agent will be shipped via approved methods in the 
appropriate  packaging  on dry ice. Storage  of the study  agent  at -70C has been  empi[INVESTIGATOR_61997]  5 years.  

 
 The agent will be stored long -term in an ultra -low temperature freezer (e.g., less than or 
equal to -80°C freezer).  
 
For aliquot preparation, the agent will be thawed slowly on ice (~4 C) and k ept at that 
temperature. Thawed vials of PVSRIPO are stable at 4°C for 48 hours. The supplier will 
provide the study agent’s potency (as tissue culture infectious doses [TCID]) and will also 
supply the appropriate vehicle for aliquot preparation. Aliquot p reparation will occur in the 
Investigational Pharmacy. All handling of the study agent will occur in a biosafety cabinet 
or a similarly contained environment.  
 
The study agent will be in a disposable, hypodermic needle with a safety sheath to cover 
the nee dle using a one -handed technique after the agent is drawn into the syringe. The 
sheathed  needle  is then removed  from the syringe  containing  the study  agent,  aliquoted  at 
the desired  dose,  and the syringe  will be capped.  The capped  syringe  will be transported  to 
the site of patient  injection  in a ‘ziplock’  bag placed  in a portable  cooler  while  maintaining  a 
temperature of 4°C.  
 
Each patient will be injected with a total intratumoral dose of 1x108 TCID 50 PVSRIPO in 
physiologic  saline  stabilized  with 0.2%  human  serum  albumin.  The injection  surface  will be 
cleaned with Chloraprep or betadine and allowed to dry. A local anesthetic ag ent will be 
applied to the injection area. There will be a single entry point into the breast. The study 
agent in  0.[ADDRESS_66897]-Injection pressure will be applied to the injection site(s) with sterile gauze for  at least 
30 seconds. The injection site and surrounding area will be swabbed with alcohol. After a 
change of gloves, the injected lesion(s) will be covered with an absorbent pad and dry 
occlusive dressing. Exterior of the occlusive dressing will be wiped with alcohol. Following 
injection and bandaging, the patients will be transferred to clinic 2.2. Vital signs will be 
monitored every 10 minutes for an hour prior  to patient discharge. Patients will be advised 
to keep the injection site(s) covered. Bandage will be replaced when the patient returns to 
the clinic [ADDRESS_66898]  bandage  and will be provided 
with gloves  and plastic  Ziploc  disposal  bags.  The old bandage  and gloves  will be placed  in 
the plastic  Ziploc  bag, the bag closed  and then put in regular  plastic  trash  bag for disposal.  
 
Compliance  and Accountability  
Compliance  and accountability  will be monitored  by [CONTACT_62040]  (ICS)  according  to their standards  of practice  (SOPs).  
 
Disposal  and Destruction  
All materials coming in contact [CONTACT_62041], the syringe delivered from the 
Investigational Pharmacy, tubing, dressings or coverings used to protect the trepanation 
site, will be disposed of as biological waste in  the treatment room. Disposal of a ny unused 
or partially used study agent will be the responsibility of the Investigational Pharmacy. All 
surgical materials used in the procedure  and potentially coming into  contact [CONTACT_62042]. Used sharps with be disposed in a biohazard sharps container 
and incinerated in final disposal. All personnel caring for the patient will be wearing 
appropriate  safety  devices,  e.g. disposable  gloves,  gown,  and face protection,  which  will be 
disposed  of as biological  waste  in the treatment  room.  Appropriate  hand  hygiene  is required 
before and after any handling of the study agent.

12 SCREENING  AND  ON-STUDY  TESTS  AND  PROCEDURES  
Informed  consent  will occur  after confirming  tumor  size by [CONTACT_62046] 
-28 and -7 After obtaining informed consent and during screening (days -28 to -7), women 
with invasive breast cancer will undergo complete history and physical exam, blood work 
including CBC, CMP, and pregnancy test (if applicable). An ultrasound, mammogra m, or 
breast MRI showing a residual breast tumor at least 1 cm in size before PVSRIPO 
injection is required.  
 
After completing informed consent for the protocol, the patient will receive a polio vaccine 
booster  (day -7). On day 0, an ultrasound  guided  core biopsy  will be performed  at radiology 
prior to injection of PVSRIPO into the tumor. Injection will be performed in Duke Breast 
Radiology  and the patients  will be transferred  to Duke  Cancer  Center  clinic  2-2. Vital signs 
will be monitored  every  15 minutes  for an hour prior to patient  discharge.  On day 10-20 

 
 (ideal 12 -16 days), the patient will undergo SOC surgery. Part of the excised tumor will be 
transported to Surgical Pathology by [CONTACT_62034] (BTBR) Team, as 
directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Roger McLendon, MD or per clinical protocol, for gross examination and 
research tissue procurement.  Additional expertise in breast pathology will be provided by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Edgardo Parrilla Castellar, MD, PhD.  
 
Tissue deemed appropriate for collection (i.e. wasteful excess and of no diagnostic value) 
will be collected  by [CONTACT_62036]  (BTBR)  Team,  as directed  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Smita 
Nair, PhD, and transported to her lab for correlative molecular and immune a nalyses. 
Surgically resected tissue will be used fresh and/or processed into formalin -fixed paraffin - 
embedded (FFPE) blocks, required for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. 
Additionally,  inflammatory  and immune  analysis  will be conducted  using  blood obtained  on 
day -7 (range day -7 to -10, before polio vaccine booster), day 0 (before PVSRIPO 
injection), day 1 -2 (range day 1 -2 after PVSRIPO), day 14 (range day 10 to 20 after 
PVSRIPO, which is before surgery) and in follow -up at months 1 (± 10 days ) and 6 (± 1 
month) after PVSRIPO. Blood will be analyzed for inflammatory and immune signature 
[CONTACT_62070],  immune  cell composition  (antigen  presenting  cells,  B cells and T cells),  T cell 
activation  by [CONTACT_62022] B cell activation  by [CONTACT_62023].  Whole  blood 
will be collected for immunological correlates on day -7 (range -[ADDRESS_66901] before polio 
vaccine booster), day 0 (before PVSRIPO injection), day 1 -2 and day 14 (range day [ADDRESS_66902] before  surgery)  and in follow-up at months  1 and 6 after PVSRIPO.

 Treatment  Period  
Patients  will undergo  a core biopsy  of the tumor  after which  PVSRIPO  will be administered 
via intratumoral  injection  using  ultrasound  guidance  in Radiology.  Core  biopsy  will be tested 
for CD155 expression, immune infiltrate by H&E and IHC, and inflammatory and immune 
signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_62047]. After injection, the patient will be transferred to clinic 2.2. Vital signs 
will be monitored every [ADDRESS_66905] -of-care surgery, will be performed on 
patients  10-20 days  after the PVSRIPO  injection.  Tumor  samples  obtained  from the surgical 
resection will be tested for CD155 expression, immune infiltrate by H&E and IHC, tumor 
infiltrating immune cell profile using flow cytometry, and inflammatory and immune 
signatures using arrays. The excised tumor will be transported to Surgical Pa thology  by 
[CONTACT_62034] (BTBR) Team, as directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Roger McLendon, MD or 
per clinical  protocol.  [CONTACT_62071]  will provide  additional  expertise  in breast 
pathology. Tissue deemed appropriate for collection  will be tran sported to [CONTACT_62072],

12.6.1  Criteria  for Early  Withdrawal  
Patients  may voluntarily  withdraw  from the study  at any time.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_33560] 
a patient from the study at any time based on his/her discretion. Reasons for PI - 
initiated withdrawal may include , but is not limited to the following:  
- Adverse  events  
- Abnormal  laboratory  values  
- Abnormal  test procedure  results  
- Protocol  deviation  

 
 - Administrative  issues  
- Pregnancy  
 
13 SAFETY  MONITORING  AND  REPORTING  
Adverse  Events  
An ‘Adverse  Event’  will be defined  as any adverse  change  from the subject’s  pre-treatment 
baseline condition, including any clinical or laboratory test abnormality that occurs during 
the course of research after the polio vaccine booster is given on day -7. Adverse events 
will be ca tegorized and graded in accordance with the NCI CTC (Version 4).  
 
A ‘Serious Adverse Event’ will be defined as an undesirable sign, symptom or medical 
condition  which  is fatal or life threatening,  requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62002] a prolongation 
of existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity,  constitutes 
a congenital anomaly or a birth defect and/or medically significant impairment such that it 
may jeopardize  the subject,  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one 
of the outcomes listed above.  
 
A summary of all adverse even ts (not just those considered related to the study drug) will 
be maintained in a [ADDRESS_66907]  be transmitted  via secure  e-mail within  24 
hours of discovery to [EMAIL_1221] . 
 
All suspected adverse events that are both serious and unexpected should be reported 
immediately to the PI, [CONTACT_62073], or her designee. Unexpected fatal or life - 
threatening suspec ted adverse  events will be  reported to the FDA by  [CONTACT_756], facsimile, 
or in writing  as soon  as possible,  but no later than [ADDRESS_66908] knowledge by [CONTACT_62049].  
 
All adverse events that are considered serious, unanticip ated or unexpected, and related 
or possibly related to the research (as defined by 21CRF312.32[a]) will be reported to the 
Duke University Medical Center IRB using the appropriate Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
report form within the following guidelines:  

 
 • Report  within  [ADDRESS_66909]’s  death  that was unanticipated  and 
more likely related to the research than unrelated;  
• Report  within  5 business  days  of learning  about  any serious,  unanticipated,  and related 
or possibly/pr obably related adverse event;  
• Report within [ADDRESS_66910] (DSMB). The 
primary  focus  of the Safety  Oversight  Committee  is the review  of safety  data,  toxicities  and 
new information that may affect subject safety or efficacy. Annual safety reviews incl ude 
but may not be limited to review of safety data, enrollment status, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35413],  accrual, toxicities,  reference  literature, and interim  analyses  as provided by  [CONTACT_11087].  The Safety  Oversight  Committee  in concert  with the DCI 
Monitoring Team ( Section 14.1 below) oversees the conduct of DUHS cancer -related, 
greater -than-minimal -risk intervention studies that do not have an external monitoring  
plan,  ensuring  subject  safety  and that the protocol  is conducted,  recorded  and reported  in 
accordance with the protocol, standing operating procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical 
Practice  (GCP),  and applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
External  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
[CONTACT_62074] A. Mittendorf will serve as the research monitor for this protocol.  Per DoD 
3216.02, at a minimum, the research monitor may discuss the research protocol with the 
investigators,  interview  human  subjects,  and consult  with others  outside  of the study  about 
the research;  shall have  authority  to stop a research  protocol  in progress,  remove  individual 
human  subjects  from a research  protocol,  and take whatever  steps  are necessary  to protect 
the safety and well -being of human subjects until the IRB can assess the monitor's report; 
and sh all have the responsibility to promptly report their observations and findings to the 
IRB or other designated official and the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO). IND 
safety reports and other notable safety information from all ongoing PVSRIPO clinica l 
investigations will be provided to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_62003], who will then 
communicate  relevant  information  with [CONTACT_62075]  and the DoD,  per their communication 
plans.  
 
If the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_62004]  a potential  conflict  of interest with conduct  of this protocol,  the protocol 
may require additional oversight beyond or in place of the SOC in the form of an external 
DSMB. If a potential conflict of interest exists, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_62005]  (RIO)  to develop  a conflict  of interest  management  plan for the protocol.  The 
plan should  describe  who will comprise  the external  DSMB,  how frequently  it will meet,  what 
it will review, and the criteria it will use to determine whether it is safe to proceed with  the 
protocol.  Due to a  potential conflict of interest,  an external DSMB -Plus was created for the  

 
 original phase I clinical trial in adult patients with Grade IV malignant glioma performed by 
[CONTACT_62050]  (PRTBTC)  at Duke  University  Medical  Center 
and was extended to all other studies with PVSRIPO conducted by [CONTACT_62051]. As the 
current study is being supported by a grant from the DoD, which requires and provides 
independent medical monitoring, RIO has dete rmined that no additional oversight is 
required by [CONTACT_62052].  
 
14 QUALITY  CONTROL  AND QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
Monitoring  
This clinical  research study  will be monitored  both internally  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_62006]  (DCI)  and poss ibly by [CONTACT_62053].  In terms  of 
internal review, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33570].  Appropriate 
reporting to the Duke University Medical Center IRB will be made.  If an unexpected 
frequency of Grade III or IV events occur, depending on their nature, action appropriate to 
the nature  and frequency  of these  adverse  events  will be taken.  This may require  a protocol 
amendment,  dose  de-escalation,  or potentially  closure  of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_62007], data, and safety of this study to ensure that:  
• If stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_62008], the study  will be halted;  
• Risk/benefit  ratio is not altered  to the detriment  of the subjects;  
• Appropriate  internal  monitoring  of AEs and outcomes  is done;  
• Over -accrual  does  not occur;  
• Under -accrual  is addressed  with appropriate  amendments  or actions;  
• Data  are being  appropriately  collected  in a reasonable  and timely  manner.  
 
The DCI Monitoring Team will conduct monitoring visits to ensure subject safety and to 
ensure that the protocol is conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with the 
protocol, stan dard operating procedures, good clinical practice, and applicable regulatory 
requirements. DCI review and monitoring of this protocol occurs in accordance with the 
NCI-approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  Briefly, protocol review begins with an 
initial review by [CONTACT_33665] (CPC), which assesses the ethics and 
safety of the protocol.  Documentation of these assessments will be maintained.  Formal, 
independent monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_33666] 3 
subjects are enrolled,  followed  by [CONTACT_62054] 1-3 subjects  until the study  is closed 
to enrollment and subjects are no longer receiving study interventions that are more than 
minimal risk.  
 
DCI Monitoring  Team  reports  and additional  data/safety/toxicity  reports  submitted  by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_62009].  Additional 
monitoring may be prompted by [CONTACT_12637], unexpected frequency of 
serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns.  Monitoring visits may also be 
initiated  upon  request  by [CONTACT_62055],  CPC,  Safety  Oversigh t Committee,  a 
sponsor, an investigator, or the IRB.  All study documents must be made available upon 
request to the DCI Monitoring Team and other  authorized regulatory  authorities, including, 
but not limited to the National Institute of Health, National Ca ncer Institute, and the FDA. 
Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain confidentiality during study monitoring.  

 
 Audits  
The Duke  School  of Medicine  Office  of Audit,  Risk,  and Compliance  (OARC)  office  and the 
Sponsor  or their designee  may conduct  confidential  audits  to evaluate  compliance  with the 
protocol and the principles of GCP. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_62010](s) direct access to 
all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of the study team to the 
auditor(s) in order to discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
 
Audit s are designed  to protect  the rights  and well-being  of human  research  subjects.  OARC 
audits may be routine or directed. Routine audits are selected based upon risk metrics 
generally geared towards high subject enrollment, studies with limited oversight or 
monitoring,  investigator initiated  investigational drugs  or devices, federally -funded studies, 
high degree of risk (based upon adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable populations), 
phase I studies, or studies that involve Medicare populations. Directe d audits occur at the 
directive of the IRB or an authorized institutional official.  
 
OARC audits examine research studies/clinical trial methodology, processes and systems 
to assess whether the research is conducted according to the protocol approved by [CONTACT_3433] e 
DUHS  IRB. The primary  purpose  of the audit/review  is to verify  that the standards  for safety 
of human subjects in clinical trials and the quality of data produced by [CONTACT_62056]. The audit/review will serve as a quality assurance measure, internal to 
the institution.  Additional  goals  of such  audits  are to detect  both random  and systemic  errors 
occurring during the conduct of clinical research and to emphasize “best practices” in the 
research/clinical trials environment.  
 
Data  Management  and Processing  
14.3.1  Case  Report  Forms  (CRFs)  
The electronic CRF (eCRF) will be the primary data collection document for the study and 
is developed in conjunction with statistical  oversight. The CRFs will be updated in a timely 
manner following acquisition of new source data. Only the PI, the study coordinator, the 
data management team, and the clinical trials m anager are permitted to make entries, 
changes, or corrections in the eCRF.  
 
An audit trail will be maintained automatically by [CONTACT_62057]. 
All users of this system will complete user training, as required or appropriate per DCI 
requirements and other regulations.  
14.3.2  Data  Management  Procedures  and Data  Verification  
Access  to electronic  databases  will be managed  by [CONTACT_62058].  
 
Completeness  of entered  data will be checked  automatically  by [CONTACT_62059]. Additionally, the data manager  and 
the statistical team will cross -reference the data to verify accuracy. Missing or implausible 
data will be highlighted  for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_62011] (i.e. confirmation  of data, 
correction of data, completion or confirmation that data is not available, etc.).  
 
The database  will be reviewed  and discussed  prior to database  closure,  and will be closed  

 
 only after resolution of all remaining queries.  An audit trail will be kept of all subsequent 
changes to the data.  
14.3.3  Study  Closure  
Following completion of the studies, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_35416]:  
- Data  clarification  and/o r resolution  
- Accounting,  reconciliation,  and destruction/return  of used  and unused  study  drugs  
- Review  of site study  records  for completeness  
- Shipment  of all remaining  laboratory  samples  to the designated  laboratories  
 
[ADDRESS_66911]-injection of PVSRIPO by H&E. Given the small sample size of 
this study, descriptive s tatistics will be used to summarize inflammatory and immune 
signatures in tumor and blood, tumor infiltrating immune cell analysis, changes in immune 
cell composition in blood and changes in T cell activation in blood. Some statistical 
comparisons may be c onducted in an exploratory manner.  
 
Tumor specimens collected pre and post injection of PVSRIPO will be examined for 
inflammatory and immune signature [CONTACT_62069], tumor infiltrating cells by H&E and IHC, 
and CD155 expression by [CONTACT_4658]. The level of the immu ne checkpoint PD -L1 expression in 
tumor tissue before and after PVSRIPO injection will also be examined. Mean changes in 
these  outcomes  will be computed,  and a paired  t-test or Wilcoxon  signed -rank test may be 
conducted with appropriate adjustment for mult iple comparison.  
 
Changes over time in inflammatory and immune signature [CONTACT_62069], immune cell 
composition (antigen presenting cells, B cells and T cells) and T cell activation by [CONTACT_62060].  Changes  over time in B cell activation  using  ELISA  and peptide 
arrays will be described. Measurements will be obtained on day -7 (range day -7 to -10, 
before  polio  vaccine  booster),  day 0 (before  PVSRIPO  injection),  day 2 (range  day 1-2 after 
PVSRIPO),  day 14 (range  day 10 to 20, after PVSRIPO  before  surgery)  and in follow -up at 
months 1 and 6 (after PVSRIPO).  
 
Additional  descriptive  analyses  besides  those described  here may be conducted using the 
samples collected.

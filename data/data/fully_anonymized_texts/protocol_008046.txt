1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEM A 
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] s tudy is an invest igation into the use of Ir -192 h igh dose rate ( HDR) 
afterloade r-based brachytherapy with catheter place ment us ing image-guided surgica l 
navigation techn iques for patients with pa inful/s ymp tomat ic metastat ic or recurrent 
lesions in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or pe lvis that have been ma ximally treated with e xternal beam 
radiation therapy.  This study will assess the feasibilit y of this approach in ter ms of 
appropriate dosimetr ic coverage of the target volu me with sparing of tis sues/organs at 
risk fro m e xcess ive radiat ion dose. 
 
Patients enrolled on this study will undergo HDR brachytherapy using the same eq uipment, 
techniques and treatment planning aspects as currently practiced at MSKCC, with the 
exception of the incorporation of image-guided surgical navigation equipment into the HDR 
catheter placement procedure. 
 
Patients will be followed at 2 months (+/- 2 weeks) post-treatment and then approximately 
every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) until approximately [ADDRESS_397011] catheters using image-guided navigational techniques. 
 
The Specific Aims of this study are to: 
 
1.  Verify feasibility of HDR treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_216938]/or pelvic lesions using catheters placed 
under image-guided navigational techniques, to provide improved dosimetric coverage of 
lesions such that 
a.  Gross Target Volume (GTV) D90 
 80% 
b.  Cord/Cauda max dose (Cord/Cauda Dmax) of < 8 Gy 
 
Secondary objectives: 
 
1.  Demonstrate safety of HDR brachytherapy for previously irradiated lesions of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321712]/or pelvis, defined as an acceptable level of severe toxicity (both acute and late 
effects) in the setting of HDR brachytherapy treatment.  Severe toxicity will be defined as 
≥ grade [ADDRESS_397012] possibly related to treatment (see 
Appendix 2). 
2.  Assess patient pain scores referable to the treatment site using the standardized 11-point 
pain scale. 
3.  Assess patients for duration of in-field progression-free survival at the treatment site.

 3.0 B ACKGROUND AND R ATION ALE 
 
Current treatment regimens at MSKCC for metastatic and primary lesions in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321713] a range of external beam fractionation schedules, 
ranging from conventional low-dose-per-fraction (high total dose) treatments extending over 
many weeks to high dose single-fraction treatments delivered in a single day.  Conventional 
external beam therapy has been shown to achieve local control rates range less than 50%. 
[Greenberg 1980, Maranzano 1998, Klekamp 1998 ]  In contrast, advances in stereotactic 
external beam radiation therapy have improved local control of lesions in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_99682] >90% 
using high-dose single fraction treatments as initial therapy. [Yamada 2008, Moulding 2010] 
For the subset of patients who progress locally after optimal treatment, local control may be 
difficult or impossible to salvage with additional external beam radiation therapy due to limits 
of normal tissue tolerance to radiation, particularly that of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. 
 
The generally accepted dose limit for the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321714] 45 Gy at 1.8 -2.0 Gy/fraction 
(Schultheiss 1995); [ADDRESS_397013] to a lower dose, with an attendant 
5% risk of myelopathy at 5 years. [Emami 1991, Schultheiss 1995] For patients undergoing 
high-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_321715], spi[INVESTIGATOR_321716] a cord 
maximal dose of 14 Gy, or less than 10 Gy to 10% volume of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321717] . [Ryu 
2007, Yamada 2008] In the event of failure, these limitations may preclude or impair the 
ability of radiation oncologists to offer effective salvage therapy with external beam 
techniques. Toxicity resulting from repeat irradiation is a subject of open investigation, with 
thresholds of 100-[ADDRESS_397014]. [Rades 2005, Nieder 2005, Sahgal 2012] (BED Gy equivalent is 
determined by [CONTACT_321753] (BED) calculation; BED = nd(1 + d/α/β), where 
n = number of fractions and d = dose per fraction; α/β is the constant for spi[INVESTIGATOR_321718] 2.) 
 
Intraoperative and percutaneous high-dose rate brachytherapy techniques may address this 
issue to improve local control, pain control, and prevent progressive neurological deficit. At 
our institution, [ADDRESS_397015] undergone placement of high-dose-rate brachytherapy 
catheters; 2 patients using intraoperative techniques and 3 patients using percutaneous 
techniques; treatment delivery has not yet been standardized and we have not determined 
the optimal techniques for placement of HDR catheters. 
 
As proposed, we will use HDR brachytherapy (Ir -192) to provide tumoricidal doses of 
radiation directly to lesions in the vertebral bodies and paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_321719] -guided surgical navigation techniques.   
The penetration characteristics of Ir -[ADDRESS_397016], cauda, bowel, etc. This makes it possible to give an extremely high 
dose of radiation to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321720] a margin of surrounding tissues over a short period 
of time as an outpatient procedure, with t he source placed temporarily into the target vertebral 
body and/or paravertebral tissues.  However, to achieve this type of dose distribution, proper 
catheter placement is essential.  Use of image-guided surgical navigation will allow pre-
planned catheter trajectories to be optimized as well as reproducibly executed, providing 
improved delivery of radiation dose. Patients will be treated

tissues. 
 
3.1 Adv antages of brachytherapy over external beam radiotherapy 
 
Brachytherapy techniques provide a superior means of delivering high doses of radiation to 
localized targets than external beam radiation.  Dose delivery from radiation is dependent 
upon the inverse square law, which states that the radiation delivered to a point is proportional 
to the inverse square of the distance between the point and the source of radiation.  By [CONTACT_321754], when brachytherapy sources are placed within lesions in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321721], very high doses of radiation are absorbed by [CONTACT_321755]. The converse is true of external beam radiotherapy; because 
the difference in the distance between the source and the lesion vs. surrounding normal 
tissues is not significantly different, the dose of radiation absorbed by [CONTACT_321756].  External radiation beams must therefore be 
specifically shaped and meticulously planned and placed in order to minimize the dose to 
critical normal structures.  However, since patient motion and setup uncertainties exist 
between the target lesion and the radiation beam, and since many photon beams will have 
some degree exit dose through the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321722], there will always be a significant dose of 
radiation absorbed by [CONTACT_321757].  
Although the same is true of radiation from brachytherapy sources, the dose 
of radiation absorbed by [CONTACT_321758], and minimizing 
treatment uncertainty permits precise dose localization and delivery of a more 
radiobiologically effective treatment in a single fraction.  Coupled with computer optimized 
inverse treatment planning algorithms, brachytherapy is well suited to deliver high doses of 
radiation to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321723], cauda equina, bowel, and other nearby [CONTACT_68061]. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_397018] 
would allow us to determine the optimal configuration of brachytherapy catheter placement in 
prior to surgery, improving target coverage and reducing procedure time; 
image-guided surgical navigation systems would then allow us to precisely track their 
surgical instruments in relation to patient anatomy and place the brachytherapy catheters 
along the pre-planned trajectories. 
 
The Medtronic O-arm surgical imaging system and STEALTH® surgical navigation system 
(Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis MN [LOCATION_003]) has been proposed as the platform for image -guided 
navigation of brachytherapy catheters along these pre-planned trajectories.  This system is a 
multi-dimensional surgical imaging platform that is designed for use in s pi[INVESTIGATOR_050], orthopaedic, 
and trauma-related surgeries and approved for clinical use for applications such as pedicle 
preparation and screw placement; it provides real-time, intra-operative imaging of a patient's

3.[ADDRESS_397020] brachytherapy for spi[INVESTIGATOR_321724] a novel technique developed at Memorial Sloan - 
Kettering Cancer Center; previous techniques have used either electron cone applicators 
requiring an invasive open procedure with poor conformality (Seichi 1999); the INTRABEA M 
electron applicator (XRS 4, Carl Zeiss Surgical Oberkochen, [LOCATION_013]) which delivers a non - 
conformal dose via a percutaneous technique (Schnieder 2011), and injection of samarium- 
153 during kyphoplasty, again with limited conformality (Cardoso 2009). 
 
We have presented on our own limited experience in HDR brachytherapy for palliation of 
previously treated lesions in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321725] 
2012. [Yamada 2012]  In our experience, 5 patients were identified with progressive disease 
at multiply irradiated sites in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; [ADDRESS_397021] been treated using percutaneously implanted catheters with the assistance of 
interventional radiology.  All treatments were performed using a two -stage interstitial catheter 
system (Mick Radionuclear, Mt. Vernon NY) and GammaMed Plus HDR afterloaders (Varian 
Medical Systems).  In all cases treatment was successfully delivered with no brachytherapy- 
related complications.  At a median followup of 4.8 months, there has been no local 
progression of disease.  Median dose delivered was 14 Gy (range 12-18 Gy) with a median 
GTV V90 of 77% (range 40-89%) and median GTV D90 of 75% (range 31-94%). (Appendix 
3, figures 1 and 2 show a representative plan). In all cases the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]/cauda maximum 
dose constraints were met.  No significant difference was noted between the intraoperative 
or percutaneous approach.  3 patients (60.0%) had pain relief [ADDRESS_397022] that the 
toxicities resulting from treatment would be similar to those experienced with any 
percutaneous procedure (biopsy or kyphoplasty), including standard risks of anesthesia, 
bleeding, and infection.  Mild fatigue and irritation at the sites of catheter insertion are also 
likely. For patients who have received previous treatment to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321726], they will be at increased risk of neurologic injury (due to repeat 
radiation exposure to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_52952]/or cauda equina and exiting peripheral nerves) and 
musculoskeletal injury (due to treatment effect on paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_321727]).  Based on the experience of Seichi et al [Seichi 1999], where 37 patients 
received intraoperative radiation therapy to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (22 of 37 had additional radiation 
therapy), only 1 patient (2.7%) developed radiation myelopathy of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  In our own 
limited series, there have been no treatment related comp lications and no late effects

Amended :  03/04/[ADDRESS_397023] that the likelihood of neurological toxicity would be on 
the order of 5%. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_397024] reduced the risk of local fai lure 
to less than 10%, for patients who have local progression after maximal external beam 
radiation for lesions in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203571], the only options are aggressive surgical 
intervention, protracted courses of steroid therapy, or systemic chemotherapy ; unfortunately 
these alternatives come at the price of high morbidity, and often these patients are poor 
surgical candidates or have already failed multiple lines of chemotherapy and as such have no 
further systemic options available.  This protocol will allow for the possibility of retreatment in 
the setting of multiply irradiated lesions of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203571], with the potential of improved 
local control, prevention of progressive neurological benefit, and alleviation of symptoms.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
The major components required for this study are the HDR catheters and remote afterloader, 
the off-line treatment planning software, and the Medtronic O -arm imaging / STEALTH 
surgical navigation systems. 
 
All treatments will be performed using a two-stage interstitial catheter system (Mick 
Radionuclear, Mt. Vernon NY) and GammaMed Plus HDR afterloaders (Varian Medical 
Systems, Palo Alto CA). 
 
The Medtronic STEALTH® surgical navigation system (Medtronic Inc ., Minneapolis MN [LOCATION_003]) 
integrates an O-arm cone-beam CT scan taken in the operative room to a set of optically 
tracked tools (drills and probes); the system is in regular use by [CONTACT_321759]. The STEALTH® system is FDA approved for procedures 
in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], including surgery, biopsy, and the placement of hardware or other devices in or 
near the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158407]. While this is not an investigational device, its application in this 
protocol is off labelIt will be used to assist in the guidance of brachytherapy catheters into 
pre-planned positions within the vertebral body and/or paravertebral tissues in which the lesion 
of concern is located; while this system is not marketed for use in placement of HDR 
brachytherapy catheters, it is approved for use in spi[INVESTIGATOR_321729].  We would also 
investigate integration of the Medtronic Synergy Cranial application to improve workflow in an 
off-label use to assist in automated image fusion of the pre-planning CT scan and 
intraoperative imaging, a process that is currently performed manually in our treatment 
planning system. Synergy Cranial is a software package used to register and fuse CNS CT 
and/or MRI images; while it has additional functionality for interventional use, we would only 
plan to take advantage of the image fusion capability. Image fusion in our treatment planning 
system may take several minutes, while automated image fusion is prac tically instantaneous; 
all fused images would still be reviewed by [CONTACT_321760].

minorities in clinical research populations.  We expect that the study population will be fully 
representative of the range of patients seen at MSKCC without exclusion to age (> 18 years), 
or ethnic background.   Given the limited number of subjects to be entered onto the study, no 
specific outreach efforts are planned. 
 
Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the pat ient’s treatment team, the 
protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center 
(MSKCC).  If the investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their 
patient’s medical records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study and 
their potential for enrolling in the research study.  Potential subjects contact[CONTACT_321762]/research staff of the study.

During the initial conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the 
patient may be asked to provide certain health information that is necessary to the 
recruitment and enrollment process. The investigator/research staff may also review portions 
of their medical records at MSKCC in order to further assess e ligibility. They will use the 
information provided by [CONTACT_5363]/or medical record to confirm that the patient is eligible 
and to contact [CONTACT_108541].  If the patient turns out to be 
ineligible for the research study, the r esearch staff will destroy all information collected on the 
patient during the initial conversation and medical records review, except for any information 
that must be maintained for screening log purposes. 
 
In most cases, the initial contact [CONTACT_321764], investigator or the research staff working in consultation with the treatment

the patients who are screened and minimal PHI will be maintained as part of a screening log. 
For these reason, we seek a limited waiver of authorization for the purposes of (1) reviewing 
relevant to the enrollment process; (2) conversing with patients regarding possible enrollment; 
(3) handling of PHI contained within those records and provided by [CONTACT_41907]; and 
(4) maintaining information in a screening log of patients approached (if applicable).

Prior to procedure : 
 
1.  Patient radiographic scans (CT and/or MRI) will be reviewe d by [CONTACT_321765]. 
 
HDR Catheter Place ment using image -guided navigation: 
 
The procedure is as currently performed with the addition of the optical fiducial placement 
and registration to the Medtronic STEALTH® system; fiducial placement, image acquisition, 
and image registration is expected to add 10-20 minutes to the procedure. 
 
1.  The patient will be intubated following induction of anesthesia. 
2.  The patient will be positioned in the prone position and prepped. 
3.  An optical fiducial will be placed in the patient for registration with the Medtronic 
STEALTH system (either mounted on a spi[INVESTIGATOR_321734] a post fixed to the iliac crest through a stab incision). 
4.  A fine-slice (~1mm thick slices with 1mm spacing) cone-beam/O-arm CT scan will be 
obtained and registered to the Medtronic STEALTH® system. 
5.  Catheters will be placed under Medtronic STEALTH® guidance, eitherinto the 
vertebral bodies/ paravertebral tissues or pelvic tissues. Placement will be based 
upon size and location of the lesion, proximity to critical structures, and hardware 
already present in the patient (i.e.: post-surgical fixation and stabilization). Where 
possible, it is preferred to keep the catheters at least 5mm apart. Catheters will be 
placed such that they will extend to the anterior portion of the vertebral body where 
applicable; spatial information of all catheters will be used to avoid overlap and/or 
collision during placement. 
6.  Depth of placement will be verified with fluoroscopic images and a repeat O-arm CT 
scan will be taken. 
a.  As with the pre-placement CT scan, image slices should be ~1mm thick with 
1mm spacing. 
b.  Field of view of the CT scan must encompass the tips of each catheter as well 
as the buttons used to secure the catheters to the skin; Teflon filaments will be 
left in the brachytherapy catheters during the scan. 
c.  Each catheter filament will be marked and labeled with depth of insertion into 
the catheter.

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
For non-serious adverse events, we will only be capturing the toxicities that are possibly 
related to protocol treatment. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be used as an instrument to evaluate 
toxicities, discussed in section 12. 
 
The toxicities associated with radiation therapy to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321738] (occurring within 90 days of the treatment) or late toxicities (after 90 days to 1 
year).  Mild acute toxicities that are expected from treatment include Grade 1 -2 fatigue and 
irritation at the sites of catheter insertion, as well as a generally transient pain flare in the 
treated bone site. Less likely (<5% of the time) would be infection or bleeding at the sites of 
catheter insertion.  Rare but serious (<1%) acute toxicities could include complications such 
MEMOR IAL SLOAN-KETTER ING C ANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL #: 12-260 A(4) 
Amended :  03/04/15 
Page  14 of 21  
  
as perforation of a visceral organ during catheter p lacement (lung, bowel, or kidney) or 
fractures in the bones of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
 
There are two types of toxicity which will be considered as potentially serious adverse events 
from the brachytherapy treatment:  neurologic and musculoskeletal.  These generally occur 
late and include myelitis or pathologic fractures of the bones of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or pelvis. 
Neurologic and musculoskeletal toxicities will be evaluated with the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria v4.0 (discussed in section 12, also see Appendix 2 for 
specifics).  The probability of severe (≥ grade 3) neurologic and musculoskeletal toxicity is 
expected to be less than 10%, which is below the currently observed rate of severe toxicity 
reported by [CONTACT_321768] n therapy for lesions of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_321739]. 
 
DEFINITIONS 
 
1.  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) 
a.  An Adverse Event is defined by [CONTACT_321769] (Guide to Good Clinical Practice) as 
any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial, 
whether or not it is considered related to the investigational product(s). In this 
trial we will only document those AEs that are at least possibly related to 
protocol therapy. 
2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
a.  A Serious Adverse Event is an adverse experience that: 
i.  is fatal or life-threatening 
ii.  is disabling 
iii.  results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] , with the 
exception of an overnight admission following the procedure. 
iv.  results in a congenital anomaly or occurrence of malignancy 
b.  Any neurologic and musculoskeletal toxicity that is grade 3 or higher will be 
considered a serious adverse event. 
3.  Definition of an Unexpected Adverse Event 
a.  An Unexpected AE is an experience not previously reported (in nature, 
severity, or incidence) in the current Investigator's Brochure or general 
investigational plan. 
 
Evaluation of SAE: 
 
Review of the patient record including the treatment dosimetry will be undertaken by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_321740]-principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_321741]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_321742], discontinue the study altogether, or to modify 
the protocol prior to enrolling more patients pending th e results of the review. 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESS MENT 
 
Review of dosimetric characteristics of the patients’ treatment plans will be performed to 
determine if the treatments were able to adequately meet determined parameters. 
 
The primary objective of the study is to validate the feasibility of HDR treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_321743]-guided navigational techniques: 
 
1.  This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_4868]: We consider a D90 of ≥ 80% for 
the lesion GTV with cord and/or cauda equina maximum doses ≤ 8 Gy as acceptable 
dosimetric endpoints.  Dosimetry will be evaluated following implantation of 
MEMOR IAL SLOAN-KETTER ING C ANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL #: 12-260 A(4) 
Amended :  03/04/15 
Page  15 of 21  
  
brachytherapy catheters and prior to patient treatment. 
 
The secondary objectives concern toxicity and clinical outcomes, and will be evaluated 
regardless of whether the primary objective was met : 
 
1.  Demonstration of the safety of HDR brachytherapy for previously irradiated lesions of 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203571]. 
a.  Both acute and late ([ADDRESS_397040]-treatment) toxicity will be evaluated. 
Neurological evaluation and ambulation assessment will be carried out prior to 
treatment to serve as a baseline.  During each subsequent follow up visit, 
patients will be asked to provide evaluations of their symptoms.  The primary 
expected toxicities are musculoskeletal and neurological.   Grade [ADDRESS_397041] brachytherapy for relief of pain 
a.  Patients will be assessed prior to treatment and at each followup visit using 
the standardized 11-point (0-10) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11). Descriptive 
statistics regarding time to, degree of, and duration of relief from pain (if any) 
will be reported in summary form. 
3.  Disease-free progression at the treatment site. 
a.  Imaging studies and clinical assessment performed at each followup date will 
be used to assess degree of response; tumor control will be defined for this 
study as the lack of tumor progression at the treated site , where progression 
may consist of an increase in maximal dimension of the tumor by ≥20%, 
compromise of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]/cauda equina and/or exiting spi[INVESTIGATOR_153315] 
(assessed clinically or radiographically), or both. 
 
The following instruments will be used in the evaluation of toxicities: 
 
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. The NCI scales are simple to complete and provide a means 
for assessing patient symptoms.  For the purp oses of this study, the musculoskeletal panel of 
questions will be limited to those pertaining to back pain and myositis (see Appendix 2). To 
evaluate neurological toxicities, the categories will be limited to cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_321744] (see Appendix 2).  Only the CTCAE v4.0 will be used in toxicity grading. 
 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11).  The NRS-11 numeric rating scale is a validated tool for 
discriminating pain level, in which patients rank their “pain score” on a scale of 0 to 10, where 
0 is equivalent to “no pain,” and 10 is “unbearable pain.” [Downie 1978, Paice 1997] 
 
 
13.[ADDRESS_397042] will be removed from the study for any of the following after review by [CONTACT_67441]: 
 
1.  If a change in the patient’s medical status unrelated to HDR brachytherapy results in 
the patient being unable to comply with the protocol. 
2.  Patient is unable to comply with the follow up requirements of the protocol. 
3.  Patient request.  Patients will be able to withdraw at any time without cause or 
reason.

14.  BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_321745] ( HDR) 
brachytherapy using image-guided navigational techniques as salvage therapy for previously 
treated lesions of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The primary outcome that we wish to assess is the 
reproducibility of the treatment plan parameters; secondary outcomes include to xicity, relief of 
pain, and local disease progression. 
 
In terms of technical feasibility, a patient is regarded as being successfully treated if the 
target D90 is ≥ 80% AND the cord/cauda max dose is [ADDRESS_397044] the following probability table: 
 
True 
feasibility 
rate 55% 60% 65% 70% 75% 80% 85% 90% 
Probability 
of declaring 
feasible 0.055 0.126 0.245 0.416 0.617 0.804 0.933 0.989 
 
 
We believe this procedure will be quite safe for patients; a previous study from Japan [Seichi 
1999] showed serious toxicity rates of approximately 3%, and we anticipate ours will be even 
lower. Among the [ADDRESS_397045] to see less than 2 adverse events.  In the event that 
a second serious adverse event (≥ Grade 3, or as otherwise defined above in Section 11.0) 
occurs, this protocol will be immediately halted and the investigator will carefully examine the 
cases with the assistance of the co-principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_321746] (to be either terminated or 
modified in order to proceed further). Self-reported pain scores will be recorded and 
descriptive statistics regarding time to, degree of, and duration of relief from pain (if any) will 
be summarized numerically and/or graphically. In-field progression-free probability will be 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimation.

16.0  DATA M ANAGEM ENT ISSUES 
 
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study. The responsibilities of the 
RSA include protocol compliance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, 
regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of 
the protocol study team. 
 
Research material from this study will be handled with the same confidentiality as patients’ 
other medical data. The data collected for this study will be entered into a secure database. 
Source documentation will be available to support the computerized patient record. 
 
16.1  Quality Assurance 
 
Eligibility of patients will be verified with the principal investigator.  Only the designated 
investigators will obtain informed consent. An assigned RSA will work with the principal 
investigators to ensure proper adherence to the protocol, eligibility verification, informed 
consent and data accuracy. 
 
Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data and inconsistencies. 
Accrual rates and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will be monitored periodically 
throughout the study period and potential problems will be brought to the attention of the 
study team for discussion and action. 
 
16.2  Data and Safe ty Monitoring 
 
With the help of the RSA, the principal investigators will review each case at the time of 
enrollment to verify eligibility. The RSA will work with the principal investigators to ensure 
that the protocol is followed carefully. 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001. The plans address the 
new policies set forth by [CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html.   The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591].  The MSKCC Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm. 
 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety 
and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on clinical research QA and departmental procedures for quality control, plus there 
are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our 
clinical trials programs.  The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) Institutional 
Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI coope rative group, etc.) will be addressed 
and the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.

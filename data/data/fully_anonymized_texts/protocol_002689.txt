 1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Parallel Group, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -
Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Eptinezumab Administered Intravenously in Subjects Experiencing an Acute Attack of Migraine  
Sponsor  Lundbeck Seattle Bio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Study Phase  Phase 3B  
Study Drug, Dose and 
Schedule A single administration of eptinezumab, a humanized anti -
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody, [ADDRESS_997483] bothersome symptom during an intercurrent migraine that occurs in subjects who are candidates for preventive therapy.  
 
 
Secondary Objectives  To evaluate the efficacy of eptinezumab vs. placebo on:  
• Headache pain freedom at timepoints up to 48 hours 
• Absence of most bothersome symptom at timepoints up to 
48 hours 
• Time to headache pain relief  
• Sustained headache pain freedom from 2 – 48 hours 
• Acute rescue medication use 
• Effect on symptoms of the qualifying migraine  
• Effect on patient -reported outcomes 
Methodology  This will be a parallel group, double -blind, randomized, placebo -
controlled study assessing the efficacy of eptinezumab for acute 
migraine, as defined as an active intercurrent migraine occurring in those patients who are candidates for preventive therapy. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 100 mg eptinezumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_730273]. The total study duration will be approximately 4 to 12 weeks, including up to 8- week screening period, with clinic visits 
occurring on Screening, Day 0 (dosing day), and Week 4. Weekly site/subject co ntact attempts via a mobile application or 
phone call will occur between screening and Day 0. The number of weekly contacts will be based on the length of time from the Screening visit to Day 0. Randomization and dosing will be triggered by a qualifying migraine and will occur on Day 0. 
Study design requires that study drug administration be initiated 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_997484] complete the eDiary at the prescribed intervals through 48 hours after start of infusion (t=0). Additionally, subjects will complete eDiary data entry from Day [ADDRESS_997485] Selection Criteria  Male or female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age, 
inclusive, who were diagnosed with migraine at < [ADDRESS_997486] a history of migraine for > 1 year before screening and 
a frequency of 4 – [ADDRESS_997487]’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_730263], if untreated, would be associated with headache pain of moderate to severe intensity and a most bothersome symptom of nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia.  Subjects must be headache free for at least 24 hours prior to onset of a qualifying migraine.  
Duration of Treatment  This is a single -dose study with a 4 -week follow -up period.  
Duration of Clinical Study

 Sample Size  The planned sample size for this study is 450 randomized and 
dosed subjects. These subjects will be allocated into 2 treatment 
groups, eptinezumab vs. placebo, in a 1:[ADDRESS_997493] 90% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_997494] ratio favoring eptinezumab at the 5% significance level for both co-primary endpoints. In addition, this sample size also provides 90% power for the key secondary endpoints, assuming that each at 5% significance level eptinezumab increases response rates for both 2-hour endpoints by [CONTACT_2669] 14.[ADDRESS_997495]  to time to pain freedom 
or time to absence of MBS will be tested using a Cox proportional hazards model at the 5% significance level. For each of the key secondary 2-hour endpoints, the treatment groups will be compared using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel tes t (CMH), 
adjusting for the study’s stratification factor. The key secondary 
endpoints will be tested hierarchically at a 5% significance level (pain freedom at [ADDRESS_997496] bothersome symptom at 2 hours). For each of the secondary endpoints, the treatment groups will be compared the same way as for the key secondary endpoints. If both key secondary endpoints achieve statistical significance, the secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically at 5% level of significance (pain freed om at [ADDRESS_997497] 
bothersome symptom at 4 hours, followed by [CONTACT_730274] 24 hours).

Table 3:  Eptinezumab Clinical Studies  .....................................................................................[ADDRESS_997512] on family  and career development ( Lipton, 2007). Migraine is one 
of the most prevalent neurological disease for which medical treatment is sought, and worldwide, 
is considered the leading cause of disability for people under the age of 50 and 2nd leading cause 
of disability worldwide ( Leonardi, 2005). Annually, lost work time and diminished productivity 
attributable to migraine costs American  employers an estimated $19.6 billion ( Stewart, 2003).  
Generally, migraine begins as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_585485].  Between attacks of migraine, the nervous system returns to a normal (premorbid) state of function.  However, approximately 2.5% of 
people with epi[INVESTIGATOR_730264], meaning they are experiencing migraine on greater than [ADDRESS_997513] 
3 consecutive months ( Headache Classification Committee, 2018 ). For those with chronic 
migraine, the headaches are more intense; associated with more migraine-associated symptoms, 
and there is greater disease- related impact and d isability and in general there is a failure to return 
to normal (pre-morbid) neurological function between epi[INVESTIGATOR_308177] ( Katsarava, 2012).  
The pathophysiology of migraine is complex and incompletely understood.  Current models of migraine are based on a genetically determined hyper -excitable nervous system characterized by 
a lowered threshold to sensory activation and uniqueness in sensory processing ( Durham, 2004). 
Interactions between the migraine nervous system and specific internal and external stimuli (migraine triggers) can result in activation of the trigeminovascular system (TVS).  Once 
activated, the TVS releases various vasoactive peptides generating peripheral sensitization of 
trigeminal and upper cervical nociceptors. The ensuing peripheral nociceptive stimuli synapsing in the Trigeminal Nucleus Caudalis ultimately lead to a state of central sensitization as third 
order neurons in the thalamus become sensitized ( Cady, 2012). Clinically, during a fully 
developed attack of migraine, central sensitization can be observed as sensory allodynia.   
Central to this model of migraine pathophysiology is calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP).  
CGRP is one of the most abundant peptides in the human body and is produced in both 
peripheral and central neurons.  It is abundantly stored in trigeminal afferents and when released during migraine leads to vasodilation, the release of inflammatory peptides, and increased 
sensory transmission.  In both peripheral and central pain pathways, CGRP is associated with 
pain transmission and neuronal sensitization ( Durham, 2006). Intravenous (IV) infusions of 
CGRP can cause a migraine- like headache in susceptible individuals with migraine ( Hansen, 
2010). In addition, ma ny pharmacological agents used as acute or prophylactic treatment of 
migraine are known to inhibit CGRP.  Thus, CGRP is an attractive target for development of novel migraine pharmacology.  
The pharmacological treatment of migraine can be divided into two c ategories: one is to reverse 
or abort an attack of migraine after it is initiated and the second class is to protect the nervous 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_997514] been previously been studied 
(MacGregor, 2009 ).   While generally quite effective, excessive use of acute treatments for 
active migraine can actually worsen the severity and frequency of migraine causing a secondary 
headache condition called medication overuse headache (MOH) ( Headache Classification 
Committee, 2018). MOH is common in populations with chronic migraine ( Schmid, 2013). 
Thus, it is critical to initiate preventive treatment before medication overuse is established.   
5.2. Eptinezumab Background Information  
A significant unmet treatment need for subjects with migraine is for an effective treatment that 
can abort an existing migraine and at the same time prevent future migraine from occurring.  Eptinezumab is currently being reviewed by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for an 
indication in migraine prevention.  Unique to its profile is that it is administered as an 
intravenous infusion and throughout its Phase [ADDRESS_997515] day following infusion.  This 
raises the possibility that eptinezumab has the potential to be a treatment intervention for active 
migraine and at the same time, provide a sustained preventive benefit. In a key secondary endpoint for the perce ntage of patients with a migraine after dosing, there was a statistically 
significant reduction in Day 1 migraine frequency for both the 100 and 300 mg groups relative to placebo in ALD403- CLIN -011; in ALD403- CLIN -006, the results were not significant afte r 
multiplicity adjustments.  
Eptinezumab is a genetically engineered humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that binds to human-α-CGRP with an affinity of 1.5E-11 M and human-β-CGRP with an affinity of 5.7E-11 M. Eptinezumab is being developed by [CONTACT_730275], Inc. 
(Lundbeck Seattle) for the prevention of migraine.  However, as an intravenous infusion (IV) with 100% bioavailability, a T -max of 30 minutes, rapid engagement and high affinity for 
CGRP, eptinezumab  may also be suitab le as a treatment for active migraine.

7.2. Clinical Study Design  
This will be a parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study assessing the 
efficacy of eptinezumab for acute migraine. Acute migraine for this study will be defined as an 
active intercurrent migraine occurring in those patients who are candidates for preventive therapy. Subjects will be rand omized to receive either 100 mg eptinezumab or placebo in a 
1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_730273].  
The total study duration will be approximately 4 to 12 weeks, including up to 8- week screening  
period, with clinic visits occurring on Screening, Day 0 (dosing day), and Week 4. Weekly 
site/subject contact [CONTACT_730276] a mobile application or phone call will occur between screening and Day 0. The number of weekly contacts will be based on the length of time from the 
Screening visit to Day 0. Randomization and dosing will be triggered by a qualifying migraine 
and will occur on Day 0. Study design requires that study drug administration be initiated within [ADDRESS_997521] complete the eDiary at the prescribed intervals through 48 hours after start of infusion (t=0). Additionally, subjects will compl ete eDiary data 
entry from Day 3 until a new migraine is reported.  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and treated. Efficacy and safety assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events and Assessments presented in Section  2.

8.3. Registration  and Treatment Assignment  
8.3.1. Registration Procedure, Subject Numbering  
Each participating investigative site will be assigned a 3 -digit site number (e.g., 601, 602). At the 
screening visit, once the subject signs the ICF they are registered in the electronic data capture (EDC), which will assign a unique subject number. The first three digits of the subject number identify the site, and the remaining four digits identify the subject. 
Subjects who fail screening may be rescreened if approved in advance by [CONTACT_7195].   
8.3.2. Randomization and Treatment Assignment 
Randomization and dosing must occur at the dosing visit (Day 0) as specified in the schedule of 
events and once the eligibility assessments are approved by [CONTACT_7195].  
Sites will complete randomization in EDC, and the randomization assignment will be obtained 
by [CONTACT_145429]’s unblinded pharmacist or designee in an interactive web/voice randomization system (IxRS).  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the treatment 
groups.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_730278] 
(concomitant migraine preventive treatment use vs. no concomitant migraine preventive treatment use) and region (North America vs. Rest of World).

• Investigator decision (with medical monitor approval) 
• Lost to follow-up 
The reason for withdrawal and the date of withdrawal must be recorded on the case report form (CRF).  
8.4.2. Timing of Withdrawal 
Subjects are considered withdrawn from the clinical study at the time that any of the criteria listed in Section  8.4.[ADDRESS_997532] an early termination visit with associated visit assessments (see Schedule of Events and Assessments in Section  2).  Subjects who withdraw consent before or after randomization but do 
not receive study drug may discontinue the study without any further procedures. 
8.4.4. Replacement Policy  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the clinical study after randomization will not be replaced.   
8.4.5. Lost to Follow- Up 
If the subject fails to attend scheduled study visits or to respond to requests for follow-up, the 
clinical study site will send a registered letter, at a minimum, to the subject requesting contact 
[CONTACT_194671].  All attempts to resume contact (including copi[INVESTIGATOR_730267]) will be included in the source 
documentation.  Subjects who do not respond to requests for follow- up after all reasonable 
attempts to establish contact [CONTACT_313408] -up.

9.1. Eptinezumab  
Eptinezumab is an anti- calcitonin gene-related peptide humanized monoclonal antibody (anti-
CGRP mAb) that is being developed by [CONTACT_730279], Inc., for the 
preventive treatment of migraine. As an intravenous infusion (IV) with 100% bioavailability, a 
Tmax of 30 minutes, rapid engagement and high affinity for CGRP, Lundbeck Seattle believes it 
may be suited for treatment of an active [intercurrent] migraine.  
Eptinezumab injection, 100 mg/mL (1 mL per vial), is presented in USP/Ph Eur. Type 1 glass vials as a single -use preservative-free solution for IV administration.  Eptinezumab is formulated 
at a concentration of 100 mg/mL with a pH of 5.8.  Those subjects randomized to the 
eptinezumab treatment group will receive an IV infusion of eptinezumab injection in 100 mL of 
0.9% saline.   
9.2. Placebo  
Placebo will be supplied as a single- use preservative-free solution in a 2- mL Type I glass vial 
formul ated with the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_730268], without the active ingredient. Those 
subjects randomized to placebo will receive an IV infusion of placebo in 100 mL of 0.9% saline. 
9.3. Study Drug Dosing and Administration  
The pharmacist or designee is responsible for receiving, storing and preparing study drug and placebo, as well as transferring study drug or placebo to the blinded staff for administration.  
Unblinded staff will not be responsible for other aspects of the clinical study where blinding is 
necessa ry. Both randomization and dosing must occur on Day 0. Doses of eptinezumab or 
placebo (total volume of 100 mL) will be administered intravenously over a period of 30 (+15) minutes on Day [ADDRESS_997533] for the occurrence of adverse events.  Subjects will be requested to stay longer than 4 hours after dosing should the investigator determine this is 
clinically warranted (e.g., subjects should be observed until all AEs are resolved or clinically 
stable).  The timeframe for the post -dose observation period must be documented in the source 
record.  
Further instructions on preparation and procedures associated with administering the IV can be found in the Pharmacy Manual and Infusion Guidelines. 
9.3.1. Packaging and Labeling 
Before the shipment to the sites, study drug will be labeled with information (protocol number, 
contents, concentration, storage instructions and any other information), required by [CONTACT_730280] a statement that it is limited to investigational use. Study drug to be administered to 
the subject will be labeled after dose preparation by [CONTACT_730281] a manner that protects the blind.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 65 9.3.2. Blinding  
This clinical study is double -blinded, meaning the subjects, investigator and site personnel are 
blinded to treatment assignment, except for the site’s unblinded pharmacist or designee. The site 
must have a written plan in place, site blinding plan, to ensure blinding is adequately maintained for the study.  If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the source. 
The blind should only be broken for reasons in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is 
critical to the management of subject safety. Medical monitor approval should be obtained prior 
to breaking the blind if possible. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_730269] 24 hours of the incident. Please refer to the site blinding plan and the infusion 
guidelines for additional details regarding breaking the study blind.  
9.3.3. Storage and Handling of Study Drug  
Eptinezumab will be stored at the site at 2
°C to 8°C in accordance with any accompanying 
instructions.  
Placebo will be stored at the site at -20°C (-10°C to -25°C) in accordance with any accompanying 
instructions.   Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional storage and handling procedures.  Diluent 
(0.9% saline) will be stored according to manufacturer instructions. 
Investigators shall take adequate precautions, including storage of eptinezumab and placebo in a 
securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or other securely locked, substantially 
constructed enclosure, access to which is limited to maintain blind, prevent theft or diversion of 
the substance into illegal channels of distribution. 
9.3.4. Accountability and Disposition of Investigational Product 
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate study drug accountability records 
throughout the clinical study. The site must maintain a Study Drug Accountability Log, on which the unblinded pharmacist or designee will record the receipt, lot number, quantity and 
dispensation of study drug. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional details regarding 
study drug accountability.  
Where more than one secure area is being used for storage at a site, all movement of study drug 
through the chain of custody must be recorded in accountability records such that full 
reconciliation may be completed at the end of the study.  
Included with each study drug shipment is a form listing lot numbers and quantity shipped. The 
unblinded pharmacist or designee will acknowledge receipt and integrity of these supplies.  A 
copy will be retained in the site's pharmacy binder during study conduct. 
9.3.5. Disposition of Study Drug  
After completion of the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for either returning or 
destroying all unused study drug. The investigator must verify that no remaining supplies are in 
his/her possession. All used/partially used vials/IV bags will be destroyed onsite according to the site SOPs or returned according to Lundbeck Seattle directive. Destruction must be in accordance with local regulations for the product type.

relative to the prescribing information for both prophylactic and acute treatments that the subject 
is using, and judge that the use of these medications continues to be considered safe. 
The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_730282]. 
9.4.3. Rescue Medications  
Rescue medication is defined as any medication to treat migraine or migraine associated 
symptoms. Two hours after start of study drug administration, subjects who did not adequately 
respond may take their own rescue medication or may elect to take no further medication. 
Inadequate response is defined as meeting 1 of the following: 
• Continues to experience moderate or severe headache pain; OR  
• Continues to experience significant migraine associated symptoms; OR  
• After initial migraine relief at [ADDRESS_997535] agree  to use adequate contraception during the screening period of the study and 
for the duration of the study. Abstinence is not an acceptable form of contraception for this study. Acceptable methods of contraception for females of child- bearing potential and males 
with partners of child- bearing potential are:  
• Intrauterine devices  
• Double-barrier methods (e.g., condoms and/or diaphragms/cervical cap with spermicidal gel or foam)  
• Hormonal contraceptives (oral, depot, patch, injectable, intrauterine devices or vaginal ring), stabilized for at least 3 months prior to screening 
• Vasectomy with use of condom (for male subjects) 
Females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are:  
• Permanently sterilized (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral 
oophorectomy or hysterectomy) at least 3 months prior to screening 
• Postmenopausal (i.e., no menses for at least 1 year) 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_997536]’s eligibility status.

10.2.3. Demographics 
The year of birth, age, sex, ethnicity and race, will be collected in the source and recorded and in 
the CRF at Screening.   
10.2.4. Medical and Migraine History  
Medical history collection will include medical history as well as social and family history.  Significant historic and current medical conditions or illnesses, allergies to medications, and 
prior surgical interventions will be recorded in the source records and in the CRF.  Symptoms 
present at the time of informed consent will be considered medical history.   
Migraine history will be collected at the screening visit by [CONTACT_093]. The data gathered will be collected in the source and recorded in the CRF, including but not limited to:  
• Diagnostic criteria for migraine with or without aura as defined by [CONTACT_25420] -3 
• Migraine medication use (past and present, acute and preventive) 
• Age at diagnosis of migraine, migraine triggers and other details of the subjects’ history 
with migraine  
Investigators must demonstrate due diligence in obtaining medical records.  All attempts to obtain medical records should be documented.  If medical records cannot be obtained, history 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_997538]’s related medical history and 
review of systems are negative.  For all other visits that call for a physical examination, the body 
systems examined will be at the discretion of the investigator.   
Physical examinations will also include height, weight and BMI, which can be delegated to other 
blinded site staff. Weight will be measured at all visits, while height and BMI will be measured at screening only. 
Abnormal physical examination findings at the screening visit will be recorded as medical 
history.  Any new or worsening physical examination finding identified at subsequent visits will be considered an AE.   
10.2.6. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, will be measured at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Events and As sessments in Section  2. 
When measuring vital signs, the subject should be rested for 5 minutes before obtaining vital signs.  Blood pressure may be repeated to confirm measurement if appropriate.    
10.2.7. eDiary Assessments  
Subjects will be assigned an electronic diary (eDiary) prior to dosing on Day [ADDRESS_997539] on the importance of completing the eDiary at all timepoints. Subjects will be instructed to complete the eDiary at all timepoints from pre -dose through 
48 hours. Additionally, subjects will complete eDiary data entry from Da y 3 until a new 
migraine is reported (specified in the Schedule of Events and Assessments [ Section 2]). The 
subject will be instructed to return the eDiary at the Week 4 clinic visit. The data collected includes but is not limited to:

10.2.9. Questionnaires  
Protocol number, subject number and date of administration must be captured on all questionnaires.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Headache Impact Test (HIT -6) 
The Headache Impact Test (HIT -6) is a tool used to measure the impact and effect on the ability 
to function normal in daily life when a headache occurs. The HIT-6 is a 6 question, Likert- type, 
self-reporting questionnaire with responses ranging from “Never” to “Always” with the 
following response scores: Never=6, Rarely=8, Sometimes=10, Very Often=11, Always=13. The 
total score for the HIT -[ADDRESS_997540]:  
 
Subjects will be given the questionnaire at Screening and Week [ADDRESS_997541] should be asked to complete any unanswered questions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire- 6 (mTOQ -6) 
The migraine treatment optimization questionnaire -6 (mTOQ -6) is a tool used to assess response 
to acute treatment in persons with migraine. The mTOQ -6 is a 6 question, Likert- type, self -
reporting questionnaire with responses ranging from “Never” to “Half The T ime Or More” with 
the following response scores: Never=1, Rarely=2, Less Than Half The Time=3, Half The Time 
Or More=4. The total score for the mTOQ-[ADDRESS_997542] should 
be asked to complete any unanswered questions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
The PGIC includes a single question concerning the subject’s impression of the change in their 
disease status since the st art of the study. Seven responses are possible: Very Much Improved, 
Much Improved, Minimally Improved, No Change, Minimally Worse, Much Worse, Very Much Worse.  
Subjects will be given the questionnaire at the Week [ADDRESS_997543] leaving the clinic.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is an assessment tool that evaluates 
suicidal ideation and behavior. The C- SSRS will be administered by [CONTACT_23872] (i.e., C -SSRS 
certified) site staff at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events and Assessments in Section  2.  The C-SSRS “Baseline/Screening” version will be used for the Screening Visit, and 
the C -SSRS “Since Last Visit” version will be used for all subsequent visits.  
10.2.10. 12-Lead ECG  
ECGs will be performed using a 12-lead ECG device provided for the study at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events and Assessments in Section  2. ECG data will be transmitted 
and read centrally by a cardiologist; however, the investigator must review the ECG at screening and Week 4 and ensure there are no clinically significant abnormalities. In addition, all confirmed (i.e., c entrally -read) ECGs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_730284].   
All ECGs are expected to be performed on the ECG device provided to the site by [CONTACT_4530]. A local ECG device may be used only if there are technical issues with the central ECG 
device that cannot be resolved while the subject is onsite. If a local ECG device is used, a paper 
ECG must be submitted to the central ECG reader. All technical issues must be reported immediately to the  central ECG help desk.

11.1. Adverse Events  
11.1.1. Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. (ICH E6) 
11.1.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
The investigator is required to monitor the occurrence of adverse events for each subject from 
the time of informed consent through the course of the clinical study.  Adverse events may be reported  by [CONTACT_423], reported by a caregiver, or reported by [CONTACT_730285]-ended questioning, through physical examination, laboratory test, documentation in medical records, or by [CONTACT_11174].  Adverse events include: 
• Any new undesirable medical experience or an unfavorable and unintended change of an existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
• Any abnormal assessment or laboratory findings considered by [CONTACT_11150].  Clinically significant findings include but are not limited to those that lead to discontinuation or interruption of study treatment, require therapeutic intervention, or require a change in subject  management.  
A new or worsening of a pre-existing or chronic condition is considered an adverse event and must be reported as such.  Medical conditions, which existed prior to the time of informed consent into the clinical study are part of the patient's medical history and are not considered an 
adverse event.  Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre- existing conditions from the time of 
informed consent are not adverse events and should not be recorded on the AE CRF. A pre-
existing or chronic condition that worsens after signing the informed consent is considered an adverse event.  
Pre-existing medical conditions of clinical significance must be included in the subject’s medical 
history and recorded on the medical history CRF page. Presenting migraine symptoms on the day of study drug administration are not considered adverse events. 
Progression of treatment indication including new or worsening of anticipated clinical signs or 
symptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy variables and assessed as uneq uivocally 
associated with the symptom progression and /or lack of efficacy, should NOT be reported as adverse events unless the symptom progression is greater than anticipated in the natural course of the disease.  
Each event recorded on the AE CRF is required to be assessed by [CONTACT_730286]; seriousness, severity, and relationship to study drug, as outlined below. 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -015  
Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
01-Jul-2020 
Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 65 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Migraines 
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying 
migraine should NOT be recorded as AEs . Migraine activity will be recorded in the eD iary and 
these data will be captured as effectiveness assessment data only. If there is any uncertainty as to 
whether an event is due to disease progression or worsening, it should be reported as an AE . 
Seriousness  
An adverse event or suspected adverse event is considered serious if in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in; 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening (that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169016] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial dis ruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition (
21 CFR 
312.32(a ) and ICH E2A).  
Of note: 
• A social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643] -admissions not due to an acute 
medical issue) is not considered an SAE  
• A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206080] 24-hour post hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730270]: 
• Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL).  
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL.  
• Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
• Grade 5 Death related to AE.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 65 Relationsh ip to Study Drug  
The investigator is required to assess the causality/relationship between each AE and the study 
drug as not related or related and record the assessment on the source documents and in the CRF 
AE page. Medical judgment should be used to det ermine the likely relationship of the AE to the 
study drug considering all relevant factors including (but not limited to) relevant history, 
concomitant medical condition and concomitant medications.  Determination should be based on 
assessment of temporal  relationships, biologic plausibility, association (or lack of association) 
with underlying disease, and presence (or absence) of a more likely cause.   
Not Related:  It is plausible that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre-
existing condition, underlying disease, concomitant medical condition, or concomitant 
medication).  
Related:  The AE cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, concomitant 
medical condition or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and a temporal relationship ex ists between the 
event onset and administration of the study drug.  
11.1.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Event reporting will extend from time of informed consent until completion of the final visit. AEs should be recorded on the AE CRF, whether believed by [CONTACT_730287].  
AE reporting should contain: 
• A brief description of the event 
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution 
• Severity  
• Actions taken or treatment required  
• Relationship to study drug  
• Outcome  
• Whether the event is considered serious 
Whenever possible, the investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis into a single event term.  For example, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].” 
Asymptomatic abnormal findings considered by [CONTACT_730288], unless it is associated with a clinical syndrome that has already been reported as an AE.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 65 11.1.4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur during the study period (beginning with informed consent), whether 
considered to be related to the study drug or not, must be reported within [ADDRESS_997545] be recorded in the 
source document.  To report the SAE, com plete the CRF AE page and indicate the reason for 
seriousness.  The minimum information required for an initial report is: 
• Sender of report (name, address of investigator) 
• Subject identification (screening/randomization number, initials, NOT subject name)  
• Protocol number 
• Description of SAE (e.g., event term) 
• Seriousness criteria  
• Relationship assessment  
After receipt of the initial report, the medical monitor or designee will review the information and, if necessary, contact [CONTACT_730289].  The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for information processing and reporting in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
The sponsor will determine if an SAE requires expedited repor ting to regulatory agencies.  The 
clinical study site personnel are responsible for reporting these events to their IRB according to the institution’s IRB reporting requirements and in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. 
Should the EDC System not be available, serious adverse events must be reported on the paper 
SAE Notification Form. Additional details can be found in the Site Manual.  This does not 
replace the EDC reporting system; information must be entered in the EDC system on ce the 
system returns to normal function. 
11.1.5. Unexpected and Related Serious Adverse Events  
Unexpected SAEs are those which:  
• Are not previously reported as associated with eptinezumab, as referenced in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
• May be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an AE listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, but differ from the event due to greater severity, frequency or specificity.  
The sponsor or designee will report, to the appropriate regulatory authorities according to local 
and regulatory requirements, unexpected SAEs which are considered related to eptinezumab 
(suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]).  The clinical study site personnel

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 65 are responsible for reporting these events to their EC/IR B in accordance with applicable local 
and regulatory requirements. 
11.1.6. Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Irrespective of the suspected causality, AEs will be monitored until resolution, stabilization in 
the judgment of the investigator, or the subject completes the study, is lost to follow up or 
withdraws from the study. 
The investigators must report new significant follow-up information to the Sponsor within  24 
hours of becoming aware of the event for SAE’s and enter into EDC Rave within 5 business days 
for AE’s.  New significant information includes the following: 
• new signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• significant new diagnostic test results  
• change in causality based on new information 
• change in the event's outcome, including recovery 
• additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
11.1.7. Pregnancy  
In the event that a female subject becomes pregnant following administration of study drug or 
may have been pregnant at the time of study drug exposure, or the partner of a male subject 
becomes pregnant following administration of study drug, the pregnancy must be reported to the 
sponsor within five business days of the Investigator becoming aware of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancy information will be reported to the Sponsor using the Exposure In-Utero Forms in 
EDC.  
Although pregnancy per se  is not considered an AE, the outcome of a pregnancy that results in a 
birth defect or congenital anomaly or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730271].  Every attempt should be made to follow a pregnancy to conclusion.   
Follow-up information is to be collected by [CONTACT_730290]:  
• The course of the pregnancy including perinatal and neonatal outcome, premature 
termination of the pregnancy, or miscarriage  
• Offspring information including birth weight and birth defects (if any)  
All pregnancies that occur after a subject completes the study and up to [ADDRESS_997546] been noted as an area of 
general concern. Based on this information, the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration

studies to ensure that subjects in clinical studies who are experiencing suicidal ideation and 
behavior are properly recognized and adequately treated and to ensure the collection of more timely and more complete data on suicidal ideation and behavior than have been collected in the 
past ( FDA, 2012 ). The C- SSRS (Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale) will be used for this 
purpose.  Any subject who answers “yes” to questions [ADDRESS_997547] who answers “yes” to questions 4 or 5 of the Suicidal Ideation 
section or answers “yes” to any question in the Suicidal Behavior section of the C- SSRS will be 
referred by [CONTACT_730291] a mental health specialist.  Affirmative answers to questions [ADDRESS_997548] experiences an allergic reaction, as assessed by [CONTACT_737], that necessitates intervention including study drug interruption or discontinuation and/or the administration of 
standard medica l treatment, the site will collect additional blood specimens using the immune 
response lab kit, per the laboratory manual, at the time of the event and again at the next 
scheduled visit. This assessment includes serum histamine, serum tryptase, immunoglobulin E, and complement components.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 of 65 12. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
The data collected will be used to assess the following endpoints:  
12.1. Headache Pain Freedom  
Headache pain will be collected on a 4 -point scale with 3 being severe, 2 being moderate, 
1 being mild, and 0 being no pain. Headache pain freedom is defined as no pain (0) with the 
absence of rescue medication (note that rescue medication is prohibited for [ADDRESS_997549] start of infusion). Assessment of headache pain will be taken at all selected  timepoints up to [ADDRESS_997550] reports freedom of pain meaning their headache pain has gone from moderate or severe (2 or 3) at baseline to no pain (0) with no administration of 
rescue medication. Headache pain freedom at [ADDRESS_997551] start of infusion is one of the key 
secondary endpoints of this study; evaluation at all other timepoints are secondary (at 4 hours) and exploratory endpoints.  
12.2. Most Bothersome Migraine -Associated Symptom  
MBS is the symptom (from among nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia) that has been identified by [CONTACT_26259] [ADDRESS_997552] start of infusion is one of the key secondary endpoints of this study; evaluation of absence of migraine associated symptoms at all other timepoints are secondary (at 4 hours) and exploratory 
endpoints.  
12.3. Sustained Pain Freedom  
Freedom from headache pain (0) at 2 hours and sustaining this pain-free status to 24 and 48 hours (i.e. pain free 2 - 24 and 2- 48 hours) with no administration of rescue medication. 
12.4. Rescue Medication  
Use of rescue medication at any time, which is defined as any intervention (medical or device) 
provided to the subject to provide relief of migraine. This should not be provided sooner than 
2 hours following start of the study drug administration.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 65 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1. Decision Rule  
Pair-wise testing of each eptinezumab group vs. placebo will be performed. The testing 
procedure will start  with primary endpoints. The result that is considered a study success is when 
both time to headache pain freedom and time to absence of MBS are statistically significant at 
the 5% significance level. If this occurs, testing will continue to key secondary endpoints.  
The key secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically at a 5% significance level  (pain 
freedom at [ADDRESS_997553] bothersome symptom at 2 hours). If both key 
secondary endpoints achieve statistical significance, the secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically at 5% level of significance (pain freedom at [ADDRESS_997554] bothersome symptom at 4 hours, followed by [CONTACT_730274] 24 hours).  
13.2. Sample Size  
The planned sample size for this study is 450 randomized and dosed subjects. These subjects will be allocated into 2 treatment groups, eptinezumab vs. placebo, in a 1:[ADDRESS_997555] 90% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_997556] ratio 
favori ng eptinezumab at the 5% significance level for both co-primary endpoints. In addition, 
this sample size also provides 90% power for the key secondary endpoints, assuming that each at 5% significance level eptinezumab increases response rates for both [ADDRESS_997557] available valid measurement taken prior to the 
administra tion of study drug on Day 0 (an eDiary will be assigned before dosing on the day of 
treatment visit).  
13.3.2. Handling of Missing Data 
Summary statistics will be reported based upon observed data. Subjects with missing data for the time-to-event co -primary endpoints will be considered to be censored at the last timepoint prior 
to the missing assessments. In the case of subjects having missing headache eDiary data at the 2-hour assessment, they will be assigned as non-responders for the key secondary endpoints, regardless of treatment arm.  Additionally, if the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is 
incomplete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication, except if an incomplete date (e.g., month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to treatment.  
13.3.3. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations to be analyzed are as follows:

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 65 Full Analysis Population: Randomized subjects who received eptinezumab/placebo. Subjects 
will be summarized within the treatment group to which they were randomized. This population 
will be used for efficacy analyses.  
Safety Population: Includes all subjects who received eptinezumab or placebo infusions. Subjects 
will be summarized within the treatment group for which they actually received treatment. This 
population will be used for the safety analyses. 
13.4. Statistical Methods  
Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequency and percentage.   
13.4.1. Subject Disposition, Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
An accounting of all randomized study subjects by [CONTACT_247070]. This 
summarization will include a summary of all subjects who have received study drug. 
Demographic, baseline characteristics, migraine history and concomitant medications (coded  by 
[CONTACT_169054]) will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6490]. 
13.4.2. Efficacy Analyses 
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The analysis of the time to pain freedom will be based upon Kaplan-Meier method. The 
treatment difference wi ll be assessed by [CONTACT_113821] -rank test. A stratified Cox proportional 
hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the 
treatment difference (i.e., hazard ratio) between the treatment arms. The median estimate for 
each treatment group, hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported.  The analysis of the time to absence of MBS will be conducted similarly.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
For each of the 2 -hour endpoints, the treatment groups will be compared using a Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for the study’s stratification factors. The treatment 
difference estimation, odds ratio, and associated confidence intervals will be provided. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The absence of headache pain (headache pain freedom) at [ADDRESS_997558] 
bothersome symptom at 4 hours will be analyzed similarly to the key secondary endpoints. 
The use of rescue medication within 24 hours will be analyzed similarly to the key secondary 
endpoints. In case of a missing assessment, it will be assumed that no rescue medication was taken in connection with that assessment. 
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
Additional exploratory efficacy endpoints will be assessed.

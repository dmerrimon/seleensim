Protocol # [ADDRESS_608547] Approval Study i s the Esteem®  Totally Implantable 
Hearing System ( Esteem ® System ). The Esteem ® has recently been approved by [CONTACT_474953] P090018.  This study fulfills the requirement for one of the Post 
Approva l Studies . 
1.2 Device Description and Principle of Operation  
The Esteem®  System  is a totally implantable hearing system designed to improve hearing 
in subjects suffering from moderate  to severe hearing loss that is sensorineural in origin.  
The Esteem®  System  consists of three components that are implanted in the subject:  A 
Sound Pro cessor (SP) is implanted under the scalp over the temporal bone and is 
connected via leads to two pi[INVESTIGATOR_474935] (called the Driver and Sensor), which 
are implanted in the middle ear.  In addition there are two components that will be used 
durin g the implant of the Esteem®  System :  An intra -operative test system, and the 
Esteem®  programmer.  The Esteem®  programmer will also be used by [CONTACT_474954] -up Esteem® System  management.  When the Esteem®  System  is activated the 
subject will r eceive an additional external component, the Personal Programmer.  See full 
description below.  
The Esteem®  System  works in the following manner:  The Sensor is placed on the incus 
bone.  This Sensor senses mechanical vibrations transmitted from the eardrum  through the 
malleus and/or incus bone, then converts these vibrations into an electrical signal, which is 
sent to the SP.  The SP amplifies and filters the signal, then sends it to the Driver, which 
has been attached to the head of the stapes.  The Driver  converts the modified electrical 
signal back to mechanical vibrations that is transferred to the stapes.  The stapes bone 
vibrates the oval window, which produces pressure waves in the fluid of the cochlea.  The 
cochlea converts the pressure waves to nerv e impulses, which are transmitted via the eight 
cranial nerve s to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound.  
Prior to implantation of the Driver and Sensor, the incus will be separated from the stapes 
at the incudostapedial joint and 1 to 3 mm will be resected from the long process of the 
incus.  This will allow the Driver to be placed directly over the stapes bone and prevent 
feedback to the Sensor that could result in poor system performance.  
The Esteem®  programmer enables the physician an d/or the audiologist to program each 
subject’s implanted SP to that subject’s specific audiological need.  The programmer is also 
used to interrogate the Esteem®  System’s  Sound Processor and provides the physician 
and/or the audiologist with diagnostic cap abilities both during the operative procedure and 
during follow -up clinic visits.  
The Personal Programmer enables the subject to select from three (3) pre -set programs  for 
background noise levels, to place the device on standby, and to increase or decrease  the 
volume of his/her Esteem®  System  SP using radio frequency (RF) telemetry.  The 
Personal Programmer is battery operated and has a low battery indicator.  
The Envoy Medical Intra -operative System Analyzer (ISA) is used during the implant 
procedure to ver ify that the Sensor and Driver are positioned correctly. It will also be used 
at the end of the implant procedure to verify that the Esteem® System  is functioning 
appropriately.

1.4 Justification for the Investigation  
In order to study  the safety and effectiveness of the Esteem®  System  in a clinical 
environment, a post-approval study was requested by [CONTACT_8415].  This post -approval study will  
include a minimum of  [ADDRESS_608549] Approval Study  is designed as a prospective, multi -center, non -randomized, 
clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Esteem®  System  implanted by [CONTACT_474947] -
trained surgeons .  For this trial the subject will act as his or her own control.  
This trial has been designed to meet [LOCATION_002]’ regulatory requirements.   
Each subject will act as both the test subject and the control by [CONTACT_474957].   
2.[ADDRESS_608550] -approval study will enroll a minimum of  45 new subjects on a consecutive 
consenting basis at 5 to 10 investigational sites to be  implanted by [CONTACT_474947] -trained surgeons. 
These subjects will be evaluated for both efficacy and safety endpoints. The goal will be to 
monitor the subjects through their one (1) year follo w-up.  
NOTE: In order to achieve the required sample size of 109 subjects for the safety 
endpoints, data from these 45 new subjects will be supplemented by [CONTACT_41224] a 
retrospective chart review of “commercial” (non -study subjects).

3 BENEFITS/RISKS  
Sponsor and the investigators have determined that the study is justified because the potential 
benefits outweigh the attendant risks.   This has been confirmed by [CONTACT_474960] 
P090018.  
3.1 Potential Benefits  
Hearing aids, cochlear implants, and semi -implantable hearing prostheses are some of the 
technologies available for the treatment of hearing loss.  The Esteem®  System  has been 
developed as a fully implantable treatment option for adults who have hearing loss.  The 
potential benefits that the Esteem®  System  may provide include:  
 Better fidelity of sound  
 Elimination of ear canal occlusion  
 Elimination of maintenance issues  
associated with hearing aids, cochlear 
implants and semi -implantable hearing  Improved cosmesis  
 Improved ease of communication  
 Improved audiometric thresholds  
 Improved hearing in noise

 Reduction of the stigma of hearing 
impairment  
 Improved quality of life  
 Regain active lifestyle  
 
3.[ADDRESS_608551] to some potential risks and complications 
associated with the implantation and use of the Esteem®  System .  The occurrence of 
adverse events may result in a revision surgical procedure, which may include device 
replacement or device removal.   
The Esteem®  implant procedure is a middle ear surgery, and the risk of a potential revision 
procedure after a middle ear surgery, including the implant of the Esteem®  system may be 
as high as 7%.  The revision rate for the subjects enrolled early in th is clinical trial was 5% 
with an additional 2% explant  rate.   
 
The potential risks and discomforts associated with the o perative procedure are similar to 
those for standard mastoid operations.  Risks include but are not limited to the following:  
 
 Bleeding  
 Cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (fluid that 
surrounds the brain) leak and 
meningitis (brain infection)  
 Damage to the Chorda Tympan i 
branch of the facial nerve which may 
result in temporary or permanent taste 
disturbances  
 Death  
 Development of ear ringing (tinnitus) 
or an increase in ringing that was 
already present before the operation  
 Drainage from ear canal  
 Eardrum perforation/hole  
 Hematoma/blood clot  
 Infection of the ear  
 Jaw soreness or stiffness   Partial or complete one -sided facial 
paralysis or stimulation  
 Partial or total loss of remaining hearing 
on implanted ear due to surgical 
procedure  
 Physical breaking or di slocation of the 
middle ear bones  
 Post-operative pain (everyone has 
discomfort after surgery for which we 
prescribe pain medication)  
 Temporary external ear or incision 
numbness  
 Transient or prolonged dizziness or 
vertigo  
 Widening and thickening of the sca r 
behind the ear (there is a small scar in 
every patient)  
 Transient or prolonged ringing (tinnitus) 
in the operated ear  
 
There may be some potential risks and complications that are possible due to the 
implantation and use of the Esteem® System .  These risks include but are not limited to the 
following:  
 
 Amplification of body sounds such as 
chewing or swallowing  
 Cranial stimulation or head vibrations  
 Decay of soft tissue or bone (includes 
erosion, necrosis, extrusion, or 
dehiscence of the wound) result ing in 
the body’s rejection of the device  
 Device failure/malfunction   Loss of attachment of leads from the 
Sound Processor or the transducers 
from the mastoid and/or ossicular chain 
bones (incus or stapes) that requires 
surgery to fix  
 Noise, distortion, or poor fidelity  
 Non-implant of the device due to fit or 
function of the device

baseline.  The testing to be performed for the screening and baseline can be found in Table 
1.  All screening and baseline testing must be completed within 2 months  of the Esteem® 
System  implant procedure.  
The screening process will begin with a  review of the Screening and Baseline Subject 
Informed Consent Form.  If the subject signs the  Screening and Baseline Subject Informed 
Consent Form the subject will not be excluded from screening testing.  
The screenin g will continue with an Audiological Pre -Screen.  If the subject’s audiological 
criteria do  not exclude him or her from the trial, the subject’s medical records will be 
reviewed to determine if the subject meets the basic screening criteria.  If the subject’s 
medical history does not exclude him or her from the trial, the Esteem® System clinical trial 
will be discussed with the subject and the subject will be asked to sign the Surgical Subject 
Informed Consent Form .

 4.3 Surgical Procedure  
 
The surgical procedure for the implantation of the Esteem®  System  is outlined below.  
Subjects will be considered enrolled in the trial once they have signed the Informed 
Consent Form.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_608561] and Esteem®  System  placement  
a) The subject will be anesthetized.  
b) Prepare subject for intra -operative testing  
c) Ensure that a facial nerve monitor is positioned to monitor the facial nerve 
during the procedure (use of this at surgeon discretion).  
d) The replica Sound Processor may  be used for determination of initial incision 
placement.  
e) The incision will be made and the ear retracted for the creation of the mastoid 
cavity.   
f) Use the replica Sound Processor to create a bed in the largest flat area of the 
temporal bone.  The bed shou ld be positioned so that the Sound Processor will 
lie as flat as possible without rocking.  Note:  The Sound Processor bed should 
be drilled first to prevent excess bone dust from getting into the facial recess.  In 
addition, when drilling the SP bed care should be taken to prevent any 
penetration of the dura.  A thin layer of bone should remain in the bottom of the 
SP bed for the SP to rest on.  If the SP bed is drilled after the facial recess has 
been opened the facial recess and mastoid cavity should be packed to prevent 
bone dust from accumulating in the middle ear.  
g) Create a channel for placement of the Driver/Sensor leads.  
h) The facial recess will be opened to allow placement of the Driver.  
i) Throughout the procedure the surgical site should be continuously  irrigated with 
antibiotic solution.  
j) Upon completion of the mastoidectomy and prior to separation of the ossicular 
chain, perform baseline test for comparison to Esteem® System  implanted 
components and record results.  
k) Separate the incus from the stapes and  resect approximately 1mm to 3mm from 
the long process of the incus.  
4.3.2  Driver and Sensor Placement  
The placement order of the Sensor/Driver is at the discretion of the surgeon.  The 
order of placement will be recorded on the Esteem®  System  Implant Worksheet . 
a) After removing the Driver from the packaging, measure the capacitance using a 
capacitance meter.  Compare the measured capacitance of the Driver to the 
capacitance value printed on the label of the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7788].   If the value is 
not within +/- 10% of the labeled value do not use the Driver.  Record the labeled 
and pre -implant measured capacitance values.  
b) Apply the first coating of EnvoyCem ™ cement to the capi[INVESTIGATOR_474936], 
taking care to assure complete coverage.

 c) Attach the Glasscock Stabilizer to the cortex of the temporal bone with bone 
screws in the base.  
d) Insert the Glasscock Stabilizer in the stabilizer socket of the Driver.  
e) Position the Driver transducer tip above the stapes and secure the Driver 
housing and legs to the mastoid fl oor using MedCem™  cement.  After the Driver 
housing cement on the mastoid floor has set, connect the Driver transducer tip 
to the stapes using EnvoyCem™  cement.  
f) Open and remove the Sensor from the packaging, measure the capacitance.  
Compare the measured c apacitance of the Sensor to the capacitance value 
printed on the label of the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7788].  If the value is not within +/- 10% 
of the labeled value do not use the Sensor. Record the labeled and pre -implant 
measured capacitance values.   
Note:  One Gl asscock Stabilizer may be used to position both the Sensor and 
Driver.  If reusing the stabilizer and it has not been remove d from the 
cortex skip to step h . 
g) Attach the Glasscock Stabilizer to the cortex of the temporal bone with bone 
screws in the base.  
h) Insert the Glasscock Stabilizer in the stabilizer socket of the Sensor.  
i) Position the Sensor transducer tip in the suggested incus / malleus position 
and secure the Sensor housing and legs to the mastoid floor using MedCem™  
cement.  
j) After the Sensor housing bone cement on the mastoid floor has set, connect 
the Sensor transducer tip to the malleus and/or incus using EnvoyCem™  
cement.  
k) After all bone cement has set remove the Glasscock Stabilizers and bone 
screws from both the Sensor and Driver.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_608562] been positioned, testing will be performed using 
the Intra -operative System Analyzer (ISA).  This testing may be performed in any 
order at the discretion of the surgeon.  
NOTE:  During the performance of the intra -operative testing the surgical site 
must be kept dry.  Therefore, it may be necessary to drain fluid from the surgical 
site during the testing procedure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intra -operative Driver Testing  
a) Connect the Driver to the driver cable.   
b) Check the capacitance of the Driv er and compare to pre -positioning 
value.  If the value is not within +/- 10% of the labeled value remove 
the Driver and do not use.  Record the post -implant capacitance on 
the CRF.  
c) Conduct Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) test to measure stapes 
displacement.  
d) Compare the Driver signal strength at 1Vrms  to the acceptance 
range  according to the ISA .  
e) Record the capacitance, and intra -operative test results.

d) Measure the Sensor signal strength in volts peak -to-peak.  
e) Compare the Sensor signal strength at 100 dB to the acceptance 
range  according to the ISA .   
f) Record the Sensor signal strength and capacitance.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intra -operative System Testing  
The complete Esteem® System  will be tested.  
a) Interrogate the Sound Processor prior to opening the non -sterile 
shelf carton.  If the Sound Processor does not respond to 
interrogation, do not use and return to Envoy Medical.  
The following testing will be performed after the leads have been 
connected to the Sound Processor a nd prior to wound closure.  The 
surgical site must be keep free of all fluids and as dry as possible during 
the system test to reliably collect valid test data.  
b) Connect the Sensor and Driver connectors to the Sound Processor.  
Verify that the lead termina l pi[INVESTIGATOR_474937] (the pin will be visible past the connector block).  
c) Program the Sound Processor to perform the system test.  
d) Perform the system test  at 80 dB according to the ISA . 
e) Record the system test results.  
f) After  completion of all testing, program the Sound Processor 
volume step to “OFF”

from an additional treatment the wound may be flushed with a 10% Fluconazole 
anti-fungal solution.  After the Sensor and Driver connectors are inserted into the 
Sound Processor, the surgeon has the option to secure the Sound Processor with 
sutures, titanium straps or Gortex strips in the previously created bed.  Verify that 
the Sound Processor fits tight and does not move.  Position the Driver/Sensor 
leads in the previously created channels and secure to prevent the leads from 
crossing, touching, or rubbing.  After all testing is complete the surgeon will close 
the incision.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_608564] -Procedure/Discharge  
Prior to discharge, the investigator may take an x -ray of the implanted device to visualize 
the location of the device so that leads are not accidentally cut in the event of a battery 
exchange or a system revision is required. The Investigator will also assess the subject’s 
clinical status and record any clini cal events.   It is recommended that any subject that is 
diabetic would be administered an oral prophylactic antifungal treatment of either

given only if in the investigat or’s best medical judgment and after a careful review of the 
subject ’s medical status and history.  
The Investigator/Audiologist/Research Coordinator will review the follow -up require ments 
with the subject to ensure compliance with the follow -up schedule.  Subjects will be 
reminded of the requirements for follow -up. 
4.[ADDRESS_608566]-implant, the subjects will be required to return for follow -up and testing of the 
Esteem®  System as listed below.   
All subjects will return to the investigator/audiologist for the scheduled clinical and 
audiological follow -up visits.  Follow -up testing should be performed in the same 
clinic/laboratory as the baseline testing whenever possible .  The testing for each visit is 
outlined  in Table 1.  
Due to the complexity of the devi ce, Envoy Medical personnel may be present at the follow -
up visits in order to assist the site personnel on programming methods.  
4.5.[ADDRESS_608567] Implant Follow -up Visit(s)  
The investigator may schedule as many post surgical visits as he/she feels are 
necessary to ev aluate each subject’s healing status.  The investigator should 
ensure proper healing of the middle ear and around the SP.  These visits may be 
scheduled as needed until the Activation  Visit, at which time the protocol defined 
time frames must be followed.   
4.5.2  Activation  Visit (8 weeks  [ADDRESS_608568] implant)  
At the Activation  visit, t he subject will be evaluated to ensure proper healing of the 
middle ear and around the implanted Sound Processor.  The device will be turned 
on to begin the acclimation period.  An audiogram will be performed along with an 
Envoygram  to ensure that the devi ce is providing the subject with some benefit.   
The testing required at the Activation Visit is outlined in Table 1.  
A personal programmer will be provided to t he subject and he or she will be 
instructed on how to use the Personal Programmer prior to lea ving the clinic.  
 
Due to the nature of Middle Ear surgery and potential requirements for multiple 
revisions, the surgical procedure may require a second procedure or “revision” to 
properly adhere the driver to the stapes. The procedure will be considered 
complete once the driver to the stapes connection has been determined to be 
successful by [CONTACT_11065]. All revision surgeries will be reported as clinical 
procedure failures.  
4.5.3  Follow -up Visits  
The subjects will return to the clinic for follow -up visits afte r the device is activated.   
The visits will occur at 1 month ( 3 weeks ), 4 months (  3 weeks) and 10 months 
(3 weeks) post activation. The visits will consist of the testing outlined in Table 1.

 4.6.1  Device Revisions / Interventions  
There is also a possibility that post -implant, a surgical intervention may be required 
to repair, replace or completely remove some or all of the components of the 
Esteem® System  due to device failure, malfunction or as a result of an adverse 
event.  The surgical proced ure may be performed in one of two ways: either 
through the subject’s original incision or through the external ear canal; depending 
on the scope of the intervention.  The surgical procedure may be performed under 
local or general anesthesia at the discret ion of the surgeon.   
A description of the recommended procedure that will be followed for each revision 
method is listed below:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mastoid Approach (through the original incision)  
 The original incision will be opened to expose the Sound Processor 
(SP).  
 The Driver and Sensor lead will be disconnected from the SP.  
 The capacitance of the Driver and Sensor will be tested.  
 The Driver and Sensor will be tested.  All or some of the intra -
operative testing may be preformed in order to evaluate the system.  
 The test r esults will be evaluated to determine if the Driver and 
Sensor are functioning correctly.  If one or both are not performing as 
expected the non -functioning part will be removed and replaced with 
a new part following the standard implant techniques outline d above.  
The new part will be tested to verify correct function.  
 The Driver and Sensor will be connected to the Sound Processor, 
system testing will be performed and the wound closed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ear Canal Revision  
This approach will only be used to give access to th e Driver/stapes 
interface.  No part of the device will be removed or replaced using this 
approach.  It is possible that the bone cement may be removed and 
reapplied.  
 An incision will be made in the ear canal close to the tympanic 
membrane (TM).  
 The TM will  be lifted away to expose the Driver/stapes interface for 
evaluation.  
 If the bone cement requires replacement the old cement will be 
removed and new cement will be placed.  
 Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) measurements may be made.  
 The TM will be replaced and  the outer ear canal will be packed.  
All revisions will be documented in the subject CRFs.  
4.6.[ADDRESS_608569] may be removed from the study  for any of the following reasons:  
 Subject has fulfilled Protocol Requirements  
 Subject did not receive the implant  
 Subject withdraws consent  
 Subject is lost to follow -up

 Endpoint:   The analysis of the incidence of SADEs and device failures and 
replacements at each follow -up. 
Hypotheses:   There i s no formal hypothesis.  This objective is to provide an 
accurate estimate of the SADE rate and device failure and replacement rate 
associated with the Esteem®  System .   
Statistical Analyses :  The incidence of SADEs and device failures and 
replacements wil l be estimated with the observed number of SADEs and device 
failures and replacements over the total person -months of follow -up at each 
follow -up.  The upper bound of the one -sided 95% exact binomial confidence 
interval on the SADE rate and device failure and replacement rate will be 
calculated and reported.  
 
Objective 4: To demonstrate that the incidence of facial pareses/paralysis is no greater than 
the 7% incidence experienced in the PMA clinical trial.  
Endpoint : The analysis of the incidence of facial pareses/paralysis at 1 month 
follow -up.  
Criterion for success: The 95% Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) for the incidence 
of facial paresis/paralysis (pparesis/paralysis )  is less than 7%  
95% UCB for  pparesis/paralysis < 7%  
Statistical Analyses :  The upper bo und of the one -sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence interval on the incidence of facial paresis/paralysis will be compared to 
7% and success declared if it is lower than 7%.  
 
Objective 5 :     To demonstrate that the subject’s cochlear function remains unchanged with the 
Esteem®  system as shown by [CONTACT_474970]’s pre -implant baseline

 Bone Conduction/Safety Algorithm  
Introduction  
Bone conduction (BC) using forehead probe placement will be the primary test for cochlear function 
stability.  While forehead placement will minimize some of the test variability issues associated with the 
mastoid probe placement as detailed in IDE G000321, the re remains the possibility that BC test -retest 
variability may result in test results outside the ±[ADDRESS_608582] the incoming signal, the Sound Processor has 
an internal tone generator that can be acc essed through the Esteem®  Programmer in a test mode called 
the EnvoyGram IT (EnvoyGram In -situ).  
Simply put, the EnvoyGram IT is an in -situ audiogram utilizing the Driver to test cochlear function. When 
entering this test mode, the Sensor is deactivated.  The Esteem®  Programmer software allows the 
audiologists to select a frequency in the range [ADDRESS_608583].   The Sound Processor synthesizes and delivers a pure tone signal to the Driver to induce known 
vibrati ons directly into the cochlea. There are twelve steps of amplitude. Each step provides a 4 - 6 dB 
increase over the previous step.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_474942]:  
a. a typi[INVESTIGATOR_474943] 40 nm at 100 dB for frequencies below 1 kHz (Validated 
per ASTM F 2504 and EMC 003798 -001),  
b. a typi[INVESTIGATOR_474944] 7502 Driver displacement in temporal bones of 88 nm/V (Validated per EMC 
003798 -001), and  
c. a typi[INVESTIGATOR_474945] (Validated per EMC 003788 -101 
and EMC 003872 -001).  
Each patient’s intact chain has a unique displacement profile.  During implant of the Esteem® , intact 
chain data is measured and recorded to provide a normalizatio n factor for the EnvoyGram IT . 
Intra-operative data, ASTM F 2504, and temporal bone studies at Envoy (i.e. EMC 003798 -001) all 
indicate that patient -to-patient variability of intact chain displacement is at least ±6 dB.  ASTM F 2504 
cites a 95% confidence interval of ±[ADDRESS_608584] chain displacement of each patient in a live surgical field is also limited to  
approximately ±[ADDRESS_608585] -chain measurements are 
recorded on the Procedure and Discharge CRF (EMC 003900 -003) and entered into the EnvoyGram IT 
by [CONTACT_430835].  The test methodology is performed consistent with the Hughson -Westlake procedure.  
A signal is presented at the prescribed amplitude and frequency. If the subject acknowledges the signal, 
the intensity level is decreased two steps ( 10 - 12 dB). If that sig nal is not acknowledged, the intensity 
level is increased one step (6 dB), thus determining a threshold. This threshold provides a measure of 
cochlear function independent of the external auditory mechanism.   
 
EnvoyGram IT SPL levels are customized to the  patient by [CONTACT_474975]’s IC data.  
For instance, a patient with typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [ADDRESS_608586] levels from 61 to 123 dB.  The table 
below lists the EnvoyGram levels for a) a typi[INVESTIGATOR_474943] [ADDRESS_608587], b) an intact chain displacement of [ADDRESS_608588], and c) an intact chain 
displacement of [ADDRESS_608589].

Since the EnvoyGram IT levels are calibrated to each patient, the “predicted” EnvoyGram IT thresholds 
are equal to the baseline pre -implant unaided audiogram for each test frequency.  For instance, a patient 
with [ADDRESS_608590] a predicted 
EnvoyGram IT of 58 dB at 1 kHz (first level above baseline unaided threshold of 55 dB).

The first level of the safety algorithm will use standard bone conduction (BC) thresholds.  Bone 
conduction thresholds are measured in the implanted ear  at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz at baseline and 
follow -up visits .  If less than t wo (2) of the follow -up thresholds are more than [ADDRESS_608591] two (2) of the 
thresholds have increased more than [ADDRESS_608592] frequencies.  If less than two (2) of the follow -up EnvoyGra m thresholds are more than [ADDRESS_608593] two

Protocol # [ADDRESS_608594] two (2) of the EnvoyGram thresholds have increased more than 10 dB or if 
any individual EnvoyGram threshold has increased by 20 dB or more, the n the algorithm is considered 
complete with a conclusion that a change in cochlear function occurred.  
 
For patients with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss, non -responses (NR) are not uncommon 
during bone -conduction testing.  If an NR occurs dur ing baseline bone conduction testing, that test 
frequency is not evaluated (for the same patient) in the follow -up bone conduction portion of the safety 
algorithm.  However, if an NR occurs during follow -up bone conduction testing (and is not preceded by a  
baseline NR at the same test frequency), the corresponding EnvoyGram threshold is substituted at the 
bone conduction NR test frequency.

Cancer or ER/PR +, HER2 negative with known BRCA1/2 Mutations: Hoosier Oncology Group  
STUDY PHASE  II 
OBJECTIVES  Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), in patients with confirmed 
TNBC or ER/PR + HER2-,  known BRCA1/2 mutations treated with single 
agent cisplatin and patients treated with cisplatin in combination with 
rucaparibfollowing preoperative chemotherapy  
 
Secondary Objectives:   
• To characterize the side effects and tolerability of cisplatin and cisplatin plus 
rucaparib in patients with residual disease following preoperative chemotherapy.  
• To evaluate 1-year DFS  
• To determine 5-year overall survival  
• To collect limited  pharmacokinetic data, in patients receiving study drug to 
compliment ongoing PK analyses in other trials with rucaparib  
• To collect archived tumor specimens, and genomic DNA to explore potential 
correlates of PARP inhibition, recurrence and toxicity. To compare limited PK 
parameters between the IV and oral formulation of rucaparib  
 
STUDY DESIGN  Safety Run-in Cohorts  
Drug interaction and increased toxicity is not anticipated, however there is no clinical experience 
with cisplatin + rucaparib. To exclude prohibitive toxicity, 6 patients will be treated with 
combined therapy as outlined in Table 1.

STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
 Sample Size Justification  
The primary endpoint for this trial is [ADDRESS_515751] an improvement of the 
fraction of patients free from disease at 2-year from 40% in the control arm to 63.2% in the 
rucaparib arm (corresponding to an HR=0.5), [ADDRESS_515752] 80% power to detect 
a difference in DFS using a one-side log-rank test with 0.10 level of significance (calculation 
done using nQuery Advisor 7.0 and assuming exponential survival).  In order to observe 38 
events we need to accrue about 102 patients, with an accrual time of about 13-18 months and an 
overall study duration around 25-30 months.  In addition, 6 patients will be needed at the lower 
dose (cohort 1). Assuming ~20% will not be confirmed to have TNBC on central review; the 
total sample size will be increased to 128 to ensure 102 in the primary analysis (using cohort 2 
and the randomized patients) and [ADDRESS_515753] 12 patients (6 in cohort 1 and 6 in cohort 2) will be assigned to the PF-[ADDRESS_515754] to cohort 
2 if  1 of 6 in cohort 1 experience a DLT (as defined in Section 5.1).  If >  2 of 6 in cohort 1 
experience a DLT, the study will be suspended and an amendment to explore alternate dosing 
schemes will be considered. Similarly, if  1 of 6 in cohort 2 experience a DLT (as defined in 
Section 5.1), the randomized portion will commence.  If >  [ADDRESS_515755] 40 patients (~20 from each group) have been randomized and 
completed 2 cycles of treatment.  Toxicity counts and rates will be tabulated by [CONTACT_408910] 
a blinded fashion. The study will be terminated if the probability that the DLT rate equals 20% 
or less in either arm drops below .10.  Accrual will continue during the interim analysis. The 
results of the analysis will be submitted to the CTMC for external review.  
 Analysis of Primary Objective   
The comparison of DFS between the two groups will be made using an unstratified Kaplan-
Meier analysis with a log-rank test to test for differences using the patients in safety run-in 
cohort [ADDRESS_515756] described above for 2-year DFS. Safety and tolerability 
variables will be tabulated separately for the two groups. Incidences of selected adverse events 
from the two treatment arms may be compared using Fisher’s Exact tests on an exploratory 
basis. OS will be compared between treatment groups using the same methodology as DFS. PK 
levels will be described using summary statistics. In addition characteristics of tumor specimens 
and genomic DNA will be correlated with PARP inhibition, recurrence and toxicity. Continuous 
measures will be correlated with binary variables (e.g. recurrence and toxicity) using maximal 
chi-square tests and continuous variables (e.g. PARP inhibition) using Pearson or Spearman 
correlations. Binary variables such as tumor and genomic characteristics will be correlated 
recurrence and toxicity using chi-square or Fisher’s Exact test. All of the analyses with the PK 
and correlative data are exploratory and are designed to complement efforts in other trials with 
this agent.

 1.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE 
 
1.1 Primary (neoadjuvant) Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a well-established role in the management of both 
early-stage and locally advanced breast cancer. Providing treatment prior to definitive 
surgery not only improves the ability to achieve breast conservation, but also allows 
determination of in vivo  sensitivity to therapy and offers an ideal platform for clinical 
research. Although many will experience shrinkage in tumor volume with neoadjuvant 
therapy, at the time of surgery only about 15-25% of patients will experience a 
pathologic complete response (pCR) with complete lack of invasive tumor tissue in the 
surgical specimen. Long-term follow-up of neoadjuvant studies consistently 
demonstrates significantly improved survival in individuals with pCR, with 
comparatively inferior outcomes in those with residual disease at surgery1-3. The 
impact of residual disease is more striking in patients with triple negative (ER-/PR-
/HER2-) disease compared to patients with other molecular phenotypes4. 
Unfortunately, patients with triple negative disease who have substantial (Miller-Payne 
classification5 1 or 2 or residual cancer burden classification II or III6) residual disease 
at the time of surgery have a dismal prognosis with only 35-40% remaining free of 
recurrence at [ADDRESS_515760] cancer (TNBC), a 
subtype of breast cancer that is clinically negative for the expression of the estrogen and 
progesterone receptors (ER and PR) and the Her2 protein 8-10. The associations between 
basal-like breast cancer (BBC), TNBC and BRCA pathway dysfunction have apparent 
therapeutic implications.  Although important to clarify that the terms “triple negative 
(TN)” and “basal-like” are not entirely synonymous, the clinico-pathologic TN 
(ER/PR/Her2 negative) phenotype is classified as basal-like via cDNA microarray 80-
90% of the time11-14.  In addition, TNBC expresses a high proportion of “basal-like” 
cytokeratins (CK) 1, 10, 13, as well as p-cadherin and Her1/epi[INVESTIGATOR_408891] (EGFR)15-19.  As a clinically-applicable test for the basal molecular 
classification has yet to be developed, the triple negative phenotype is a reasonable 
surrogate for the basal-like subtype -- a subtype of breast cancer commonly seen among 
BRCA1  mutation carriers20.  Moreover, a recent study of over 400 women reports TNBC 
among two-thirds of patients who carried a BRCA1 mutation21.  The tight association 
between BRCA1  mutations, BBC and TNBC has raised the question as to whether 
BRCA1  loss of function through other mechanisms participates in the pathogenesis of 
sporadic basal-like and TNBC – an association which could be exploited therapeutically.  
Pre-clinically tumors that harbor BRCA mutations are more sensitive to DNA damaging 
chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin. Two recent clinical trials reported high pCR rates 
with cisplatin monotherapy regimens in patients with known BRCA mutations (72% in 
Gronwald et al, ASCO 2009, #502)  or cisplatin in combination with bevacizumab in 
those with TNBC regardless of mutation status (36% in Ryan et al, ASCO 2009 #551). 
This pre-clinical and emerging clinical data supports the use of cisplatin in patients with 
TNBC who harbor substantial residual disease after standard neoadjuvant therapy.

1.3 PARP Inhibition 
PARP is an abundant, constitutively-expressed nuclear enzyme that catalyzes the transfer 
of ADP-ribose polymers from NAD+ to target proteins, through which it facilitates DNA 
repair, cellular proliferation, and signaling to other critical cell cycle proteins and 
oncogenes8-22-27. At sites of DNA damage, PARP activates intracellular signaling 
pathways that modulate DNA repair and cell survival through poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation 
of a number of nuclear proteins involved in the chromatin architecture and DNA 
metabolism. Immediate catalytic activation of PARP in response to DNA single- and 
double-strand breaks has been reported at levels up to 500-fold26,28. 
 
BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes encode for proteins critical for DNA integrity and genomic 
stability29-31.  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor-suppressor proteins essential for cell 
division, DNA error control, DNA repair and apoptosis. In 2005 Bryant32 and Farmer33 
showed that BRCA-deficient cells were extremely sensitive to PARP inhibition. Single 
agent PARP inhibitors led to impaired SSB repair causing double strand breaks (DSBs) 
in replicative cells. In BRCA wild type cells DSBs are repaired via homologous 
recombination (HR), but in BRCA “altered” cells HR is impaired and alternative 
pathways lead to complex rearrangements, loss of repair mechanisms and cell death 
(“synthetic lethality”)34. Significant single agent activity was recently reported with the 
PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients with previously treated BRCA-deficient metastatic 
breast cancer. Overall responses ranged from 22% (100 mg bid) to 41% (400 mg bid) 
with minimal toxicity35 
 
Importantly, due to molecular and pathologic similarities between TNBC and BRCA-
associated breast cancers36,37, whose homologous recombination-dependent DNA repair 
is impaired, pharmacological inhibition of PARP is predicted to specifically and 
irreversibly augment the existing instability of these tumors.  
 
In summary, there are at least three roles of PARP inhibitors in cancer treatment: 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitization, synthetic lethality in patients with 
hereditary mutations in BRCA1/2 genes (inherited defect in homologous recombination), 
and finally leveraging of “BRCA-like” defects tumors with spontaneous defects in DNA 
repair such as triple negative breast cancer. 
 
1.4 Rucaparib  
Rucaparib  (also known as CO-338, formerly known as AG-[ZIP_CODE] and/or PF-01367338) is 
a small molecule inhibitor of PARP being developed for cancer indications, to be used in 
conjunction with temozolomide, irinotecan, and other chemotherapeutic agents where 
PARP-related DNA repair may impede their maximum therapeutic effect.  In addition, 
rucaparib  is being investigated as a single agent in BRCA1 and BRCA2 patients with 
advanced/pretreated breast or ovarian neoplasia.  
Results of studies with animal models suggest that rucaparib  exposures that inhibit PARP 
will be associated with enhanced antitumor activity of temozolomide and other 
chemotherapeutic agents.  Hence, the clinical program assessed bioactivity and safety in 
patients with malignancies, commonly treated with the selected chemotherapeutic agents.  
Based on the in vitro IC90 against the target, adjusted for protein binding, a sustained 
Hoosier Oncology Group BRE09-146                                                            Version Date 27SEPT2011 
  Confidential  
13 
 plasma concentration of >5.9 ng/mL was projected to be needed in humans to inhibit 
PARP and enhance antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic agents.  This target was 
reached at the [ADDRESS_515761] rucaparib  doses (8 and 12 mg/m2) in Part 1 of the Phase 1 study 
A4991002.  Among the 3 patients who received the PID of 12 mg/m2, concentrations of 
10.6, 10.6, and 46.5 ng/mL, respectively, were observed 24 hours after rucaparib  infusion 
on Day 1. 
Non-clinical evaluation has demonstrated exquisite sensitivity of BRCA1 or BRCA2 
homozygous cell lines, which is attributed to PARP inhibition alone, and provides a 
rationale for the clinical assessment of rucaparib  as a single agent in patients with BRCA1 
and BRCA2 deficient tumors. 
Following administration of an IV dose of [14C]-labeled drug to intact rats, mean urine, 
and fecal recoveries were 33% and 61%, respectively, with a mean cumulative recovery 
of 95% of dose.  Mean recovery of radioactivity in urine, bile, and feces from bile 
duct-cannulated rats was 49%, 31%, and 17%, respectively, with a mean cumulative 
recovery of 98%.  Careful dose titration should be used in subjects with impaired renal 
and/or hepatic function.  Following a single IV dose in rodents, dogs, or monkeys, mean 
systemic clearance was moderate to rapid, the apparent volume of distribution was large, 
and the terminal half-life was relatively short (t1/2: 2.8 hours in rats, 4.5 hours in dogs, 
5.2 hours in monkeys).   
Nonclinical safety studies performed to date have identified the target organs for 
rucaparib  to be the bone marrow, lymphoid organs (eg, thymus, lymph nodes), and heart, 
with emesis being dose-limiting in the dog.  At doses tested above the NOAEL in rats 
and dogs, cardiac effects (structural and functional) were observed in addition to 
potential QT liability detected in vitro by [CONTACT_408911] - IKr assay.  At 
the high-dose (40 mg/kg/day) in dogs, histopathologic findings in the heart were limited 
to endocardial hemorrhage, ECG abnormalities (persistent sinus tachycardia, 
atrioventricular nodal rhythm), and sudden death (2 of 12 dogs) were also noted at this 
rucaparib dose.  The cardiac effects in the acute and multidose studies were observed at 
concentrations significantly higher than those predicted to inhibit PARP in humans.  
Peak human exposure at the projected efficacious dose of 20 mg/m2 is estimated to be 
89 ng/mL, which is 25-fold and 176-fold lower than the observed exposures associated 
with cardiovascular toxicity in rats and dogs, respectively. 
Based on nonclinical cardiac findings, collection of ECGs was required in Phase 1 study 
A4991002 during the screening period; before and after rucaparib  infusion on Days -7, 1, 
and [ADDRESS_515762] cycle; before the first AG-014699 infusion of every other cycle 
thereafter; and at the post treatment follow-up visit.  All patients completed at least

1.5 Rucaparib  + Chemotherapy 
In vitro studies in human tumor cells lines of rucaparib  and similar compounds have 
shown that the combination of the PARP inhibitor with ionizing radiation, 
temozolomide, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, and bleomycin increased the 
cytotoxicity of the DNA damaging agent. In the Phase [ADDRESS_515764] 1 dose of rucaparib  together with temozolomide.  There were no 
deaths related to rucaparib .  Two (6%) patients had nonfatal SAEs that were considered 
related to rucaparib .  Many of the other events were related to the co-administered 
temozolomide and consistent with the known safety profile of temozolomide. 
 
In the Phase [ADDRESS_515765] 1 cycle of rucaparib  (administered 
intravenously at a dose of 12 mg/m2/day from Day 1 to 5 every 4 weeks) and 
Temozolomide (administered orally at a dose of 200 mg/m2/day from Day 1 to 5 every 
4 weeks).  Eleven patients completed the study and 35 were discontinued early. All 
patients experienced treatment-related adverse events.  The majority of CTC Grade 3 or 
4 adverse events were myelotoxicities and occurred in cycle 1.  The incidence of 
haematological toxicities appeared to be controlled by [CONTACT_408912]. 
 
An ongoing phase I study is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic of rucaparib  administered with full combination doses of carboplatin, 
paclitaxel, cisplatin and pemetrexed. 
 
1.6 Rucaparib  (CO-338/AG-014699/PF-01367388) Starting Dose Rationale 
In the Phase 1 clinical study A4991002 the rucaparib  Recommended Phase 2 Dose 
(RP2D) has been determined to be 12 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 28 day cycle with full 
dose of Temozolomide. 
Moreover from a pharmacokinetic point of view, whether a drug should be administered 
on a fixed dose or Body Surface Area (BSA) normalized dose depends on whether the 
pharmacokinetics of the drug changes with BSA. The effect of BSA on systemic 
exposure of rucaparib  (AUC 0-24) was evaluated for this purpose. It is observed that the 
AUC 0-24 normalized for actual dose and the AUC (0-24) normalized for mg/m2 dose 
do not correlate with BSA. Furthermore, inter-subject variability is similar for actual 
dose normalized AUC (0-24) (53.9%) and mg/m2 dose normalized AUC (0-24) (54.1%). 
This suggests that rucaparib  can be given either as a fixed dose or on a mg/m2 based dose. 
The starting dose for rucaparib  in the current study will be the fixed dose of 16 mg/day, 
lower than the 24 mg/day that would correspond to the “per square meter” RP2D of 12 
mg/m2/day determined in study A4991002. A single dose escalation to 30 mg/day will be 
allowed in patients without significant toxicity in cycle 1. In addition, as the

 chemotherapy regimen being studied will be administered on a 3-week basis, the 
rucaparib  schedule has been modified accordingly. rucaparib  will thus be administered 
from Day 1 to Day 3 every 21 days. A similar dosing strategy has been employed in the 
planned/ongoing phase I trial evaluating rucaparib  in combination with multiple 
chemotherapy regimens. 
Complete information for rucaparib  may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.7 Rucaparib  (CO-338/AG-014699/PF-01367338) Oral Formulation 
The oral formulation of rucaparib contains the camsylate salt of the active agent 
rucaparib.  All dosage strengths are express as the weight of free base rucaparib. Two 
strengths of oral rucaparib, 40 mg and 60 mg, are available as immediate release film 
coated tablets.  The physical appearances of the tablets are unique in order to ensure 
proper identification.  40 mg rucaparib tablets are 9.5 mm round convex in shape, while 
60 mg tablets are 15.4 mm x 8 mm oval in shape.  In addition to active agent, tablets 
contain microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, dicalcium phosphate, and 
magnesium stearate.  The cosmetic white film coating is Opadry II containing HPMC 
2910, hypromellose 6cP, macrogol/PEG3350, triacetin, titanium dioxide, and lactose 
monohydrate. 
 
In the on-going Phase I study of rucaparib in combination with chemotherapy, 
administration of the oral formulation is associated with average bioavailability is 30-
40%, thus 100 mg is the estimated bioequivalent dose for the 30mg IV dose. Use of the 
oral dose during maintenance therapy will increase patient convenience and decrease the 
risk of infusion and/or access device related complications.

5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
All cisplatin doses will be based on the patient’s actual weight. The actual weight at 
screening should be used for calculating body surface area (BSA). The BSA may be 
recalculated based on the actual weight at the start of each treatment cycle but 
recalculation is only required if a patient’s weight changes by   10%. 
 
N
OTE: rucaparib  dose is fixed, not based on body weight or body surface area (mg/M2). 
As such, rucaparib  dose is not adjusted for changes in the patient’s weight. 
 
NOTE: Prophylactic use of white blood cell growth factors (i.e. Neulasta, Neupogen, 
Leukine, or similar agent) is not allowed.  However, white blood cell growth factors may 
be used in accordance with ASCO guidelines if neutropenic fever occurs. 
 
Recombinant erythropoietin or similar compound may NOT be administered for anemia 
due to restrictions on their use in patients being treated with curative intent. 
 
5.1  Pre-medication  
It is strongly recommended that all patients receive adequate anti-emetics with cisplatin.  
NOTE:   Pre-medication for cisplatin may be given prior to the rucaparib  drug infusion.  
The specifics of the pre-medication regimen are at the discretion of the treating 
physician, provided adequate control of nausea is achieved. One potential regimen 
consists of [ADDRESS_515775] 
(such as 2 mg oral or 10 mcg/kg IV granisetron, or 32 mg oral or IV ondansetron) on the 
day of cisplatin administration. Followed by [CONTACT_408913]-emetics consisting of 4 days 
of oral dexamethasone (8 mg po bid for 2 days (days 2, 3) then 4 mg po bid for 2 days 
(days 4, 5) and scheduled metoclopramide or 5HT3 antagonist for days 2-5 for delayed 
emesis NOTE: Dexamethasone dose should be reduced by 50% when administered with 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]. 
 
Hydration guidelines may be modified at the discretion of the treating physician provided 
adequate pre and post cisplatin hydration is achieved and renal function remains 
adequate. One suggested  regimen consists of administering cisplatin in [ADDRESS_515776] of NS at 500 cc/hr x [ADDRESS_515777] of ½ NS + 10 meq KCl/liter + 1 gram magnesium 
sulfate/liter + 25 grams mannitol/liter at 500 cc/hr for at least one hour, followed by

5.3 Missed doses  
In general patients should be encouraged to comply with the treatment schedule. 
However, if IV treatment is missed for reasons other than toxicity (patient vacation, 
family emergency, etc.), patients able to resume treatment within 2 weeks should receive 
the full planned number of cycles. If a delay of more than 2 weeks is required, the missed 
IV treatment should be deleted (ie: not made up) and patients should proceed with the 
next cycle as originally scheduled.  
 
During oral maintenance therapy, if a missed dose is discovered within 3 days of the 
scheduled administration time, patients should take that dose immediately. If a missed 
dose is not discovered until more than 3 days after the scheduled administration time, 
that dose should not be made up and the patient should resume treatment the following 
week. 
 
5.4 Special instructions for patients initiating IV maintenance therapy prior  to 
Amendment #5 
Patients who initiate IV rucaparib  maintenance therapy prior  to approval of Amendment 
#5 should switch to oral maintenance upon local approval of Amendment #5 and when 
oral drug is available.  
• Patients, who are at week 17 or higher of IV rucaparib when Amendment #5 is 
approved,  should complete the study on IV rucaparib and not be switched over to 
oral rucaparib.  
 
•  All other patients should be switched over when Amendment # 5  is approved.  
However, to avoid disruption of the evaluation schedule, patients should continue

 IV maintenance rucaparib  until the next clinical evaluation (required every 4 weeks 
as per Table 12). If patients required a dose modification during IV maintenance 
therapy, that dose modification should carry over when patients switch to the oral 
formulation. See Table 7 for dose level equivalents. 
• Patients switching from IV to oral maintenance should have PK samples obtained 
with the first and fifth week of oral maintenance therapy  (see Section 7.4 and 9.3 
for details) 
 
5.5 Supportive Care 
The use of supportive care including antibiotics, and blood transfusions will be permitted 
as clinically indicated and according to institutional guidelines. 
 
Prophylactic use of white blood cell growth factors (i.e. Neulasta, Neupogen, 
Leukine, or similar agent) is not allowed.  However, white blood cell growth factors 
may be used in accordance with ASCO guidelines if neutropenic fever occurs. 
 
Recombinant erythropoietin or similar compound may NOT be administered for 
anemia due to restrictions on their use in patients being treated with curative intent. 
 
5.6 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant aminoglycoside antibiotic use should be avoided during cisplatin therapy 
and until patient has fully recovered (i.e., at least [ADDRESS_515787] dose of cisplatin). 
 
Bisphosphonate use is allowed.

7.5 TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION 
A patient will be discontinued from the treatment under the following circumstances: 
• If there is evidence of progressive disease.  
• If the attending physician thinks a change of therapy would be in the best interest of 
the patient. 
• If the patient requests discontinuation. 
• If the drug(s) exhibit(s) unacceptable adverse event. Patients will be followed until 
the resolution of these adverse events. 
• If a patient becomes pregnant.

7.7 FOLLOW-UP: 
• Patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_209686] (chest wall, axillary, or supraclavicular nodes) or distal recurrent 
disease at least once every [ADDRESS_515809] every 
6 months during years 3-5 after randomization.  
• Suggested guidelines for surveillance of breast cancer survivors are available 
through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( www.nccn.org ).  
• Routine blood work or radiology in the absence of symptoms suggestive of 
recurrent disease is not recommended.  
• Remaining breast tissue (contralateral breast and ipsilateral breast in patients 
treated with breast conserving surgery) should be imaged annually according 
to standard screening guidelines.  
 
 
8.0 CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is disease-free survival (DFS) in patients 
confirmed (by [CONTACT_200029]) to have triple negative tumors or known BRCA1/2 
mutation. DFS is defined as the duration of time from randomiz ation to time of an DFS 
event, defined as local failure (invasive), regional failur e, distant failure, contralateral 
breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive), any other second cancer (excluding non-
melanomatous skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ), or death from any cause. The 
diagnosis of local or distant recurrence should ideally be pathologically confirmed , 
however if biopsy if not possible, radiology confirmation by [CONTACT_4654], MRI, or PET scan is 
acceptable.

9.1 Central Pathology Reassessment  
Analysis by [CONTACT_408916] (ASCO) and College of 
American Pathology (CAP) expert panel suggests that approximately 20% of ER, PR, 
and HER2 tests performed in community laboratories are inaccurate with a fairly equal 
distribution of false positive and false negative results. While the ASCO/CAP guidelines 
seek to improve test quality and reliability, the impact of these recently published25-[ADDRESS_515810]. Sunil

will be constructed to facilitate potential future correlative studies including genetic 
assessment of DNA damage repair pathways and potential gene expression profiles that 
might predict sensitivity to PARP inhibition. 
 
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from biopsy at the time of initial 
diagnosis (optional) and from the residual disease removed at the time of definitive 
surgery (mandatory) should be sent within 30 days of randomization (or registration for 
patients enrolled to the safety run-in).

9.2 Genomic DNA – Optional 
It has become increasingly clear that therapeutic heterogeneity may arise from 
differences in the tumor (e.g. p53 expression or defects in DNA repair) and/or 
differences in the host (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms). Although a candidate 
gene approach is a high yield strategy for biomarker discovery, the variability seen in 
most disease processes is highly dependent on complex gene-gene interactions. Recently, 
advances in technical platforms and bioinformatics have made genome wide association 
studies (GWAS) feasible. This comprehensive approach has led to some important 
discoveries including identification of genes, SNPs, and haplotypes associated with 
breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, myocardial infarction, and 
type-2 diabetes. Thus, GWAS has become a powerful platform for biomarker discovery. 
DNA samples from patients enrolled in this trial will be an incredibly valuable resource 
for potential future correlative studies using these emerging genomic and 
pharmacogenomic technologies.  
 
Whole blood will be collected for assessment of potential genomic determinants of 
response and toxicity.

9.3 Rucaparib  Pharmacokinetics (Safety Run-in Cohorts and Arm B patients only) – 
Mandatory 
Extensive pharmacokinetics (PK) is being conducted in several ongoing rucaparib  trials 
and thus detailed PK sampling is not planned in this trial. However, limited PK sampling 
will be conducted to complement the other ongoing efforts. Plasma samples will be 
obtained prior to infusion and  5minutes (+/- 5 minutes) prior to the end of infusion on 
Day 3 of cycles 1 and 2 during combination therapy and weeks 1 and 5 of IV 
maintenance therapy. Plasma samples will be obtained prior to administration and 2 
hours (+/- 5 minutes) post dose during week 1 and week 5 of oral maintenance therapy in 
all patients (including those who initiated maintenance therapy with the IV formulation).  
For all collections, the start and end of rucaparib  infusion as well as actual time of all PK 
sample collections should be recorded in the source documents.  PK samples will be 
assayed for rucaparib  (CO-338/AG-014699/PF-01367388) using a validated analytical 
method. Detailed instructions on sample collection, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_408898].

10.1.3 Storage and Reconstitution: Vials of rucaparib  Lyophilized Powder for Injection, 
12 mg/vial (as free base), must be stored at room temperature (15°C to 30°C) and 
protected from light.  
 
Each rucaparib  drug product vial is to be reconstituted with 6 mL sterile WFI to yield a 
2 mg/mL (as free base) clear yellow solution.  Once [ADDRESS_515812] 30 seconds to allow 
complete drug dissolution in the vial.  The reconstituted solution should be clear and free 
of particles.  Segregate and store any rejected vials separately at controlled room 
temperature (15 to 30°C) and notify sponsor immediately.  The reconstituted rucaparib  
drug product must be used within 24 hours and stored at controlled room temperature 
(15°C to 30°C).  Do not refrigerate reconstituted product. 
 
Bottles of rucaparib  40 mg and 60 mg (as free base) immediate release film coated tablets, 
must be stored at room temperature (15°C to 30°C) 
. 
10.1.4 IV administration : The reconstituted solution will be mixed in an infusion bag 
containing D5W.  Drug should be administered as listed in table [ADDRESS_515813] patient. 
Chemotherapy will be administered approximately one hour after the end of rucaparib  
administration. 
Oral administration : Patients should take rucaparib  fasting (at least [ADDRESS_515814] 2 hours after  eating) 
10.1.5 Side Effects:  
In general rucaparib  has been well tolerated in early clinical trials; dose limiting toxicity has not 
been identified at doses that effectively inhibit PARP. Most adverse events were reversible and 
short in duration. Most hematologic toxicity was related to concurrently administered 
chemotherapy and was not obviously increased with combined therapy. No cardiac toxicity 
(changes in electrocardiogram or left ventricular ejection fraction) with repeated dosing. The 
main adverse event associated only with rucaparib  is mild injection site reaction.

10.2 Cisplatin Other: Platinol (NSC-119875); Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum  
 
10.2.1   Classification:   Alkylating agent 
 
10.2.2  Action:  
Cisplatin forms covalent bonds with nucleophilic sites on guanine present in all DNA. As 
cisplatin is a bifunctional agent, it is able to bind to [ADDRESS_515815] it. This, ultimately, causes cell death 
(apoptosis). 
 
10.2.3  Availability:  
 Cisplatin is commercially available. 
  
10.2.4  Storage :  
Cisplatin Injection is a sterile, multi-dose vial without preservatives. Store at 15° to 25°C 
(59° to 77°F). Note: Do not refrigerate. Protect unopened container from light. The 
cisplatin remaining in the amber vial following initial entry is stable for 28 days 
protected from light or for 7 days under fluorescent room light. 
 
10.2.5  Reconstitution :  
The aqueous solution should be used intravenously only and should be administered by 
[CONTACT_24636]. Cisplatin is a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. Appropriate precautions for 
hazardous drug handling should be taken during handling, preparation, administration 
and disposal of this agent. As with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be 
exercised in handling the aqueous solution. Skin reactions associated with accidental 
exposure to cisplatin may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If cisplatin contacts 
the skin or mucosa, immediately and thoroughly wash the skin with soap and water and 
flush the mucosa with water. 
10.2.6  Administration : 
 Cisplatin will be administered IV according to institutional guidelines. 
Hydration for cisplatin can be administered at the discretion of the treating physician and   
according to institutional standards. However, the following regimen is suggested:

10.2.7 Side Effects : 
Nephrotoxicity:  Dose related and cumulative renal insufficiency is the major dose-limiting 
toxicity. Renal toxicity has been noted in 28-36% of patients treated with a single dose of 50 
mg/m2. It is first noted during the second week after a dose and is manifested by [CONTACT_408918], serum uric acid, and/or a decrease in creatinine clearance. 
Note: Renal toxicity becomes more prolonged and severe with repeated courses of the drug. 
Renal function must return to normal before another dose of cisplatin can be given.

  Confidential  
43 
 10.2.8 Ototoxicity:  Ototoxicity has been observed in up to 31% of patients treated with a single dose 
of cisplatin 50 mg/m2, and is manifested by [CONTACT_30547]/or hearing loss in the high frequency 
range (4,000 to 8,000 Hz). Decreased ability to hear normal conversational tones may occur 
occasionally. Deafness after the initial dose of cisplatin has been reported rarely. Ototoxic 
effects may be more severe in children receiving cisplatin. Hearing loss can be unilateral or 
bilateral and tends to become more frequent and severe with repeated doses. Ototoxicity may 
be enhanced with prior or simultaneous cranial irradiation. It is unclear whether cisplatin-
induced ototoxicity is reversible. Ototoxic effects may be related to the peak plasma 
concentration of cisplatin. Vestibular toxicity has also been reported. Ototoxicity may become 
more severe in patients being treated with other drugs with nephrotoxic potential. Patients 
should be questioned regarding any history of hearing deficit. 
 
10.2.9 Hematologic : Myelosuppression occurs in 25% to 30% of patients treated with cisplatin. The 
nadirs in circulating platelets and leukocytes occur between days 18 to 23 (range 7.5 to 45) 
with most patients recovering by [CONTACT_4475] 39 (range 13 to 62). Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia 
are more pronounced at higher doses (>50 mg/m2). Anemia (decrease of 2 g hemoglobin/100 
mL) occurs at approximately the same frequency and with the same timing as leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia. Fever and infections have also been reported in patients with neutropenia. 
In addition to anemia secondary to myelosuppression, a Coombs’ positive hemolytic anemia 
has been reported. In the presence of cisplatin hemolytic anemia, a further course of treatment 
may be accompanied by [CONTACT_408919], and this risk should be weighed by [CONTACT_298144]. 
 
The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of cisplatin has rarely been 
reported in humans. In these reports, cisplatin was generally given in combination with other 
leukemogenic agents. 
 
10.2.10 Gastrointestinal : Marked nausea and vomiting occur in almost all patients treated with 
cisplatin, and are occasionally so severe that the drug must be discontinued. Nausea and 
vomiting usually begin within [ADDRESS_515816] for 24 hours. Various 
degrees of vomiting, nausea and/or anorexia may persist for up to 1 week after treatment. 
Delayed nausea and vomiting (begins or persists 24 hours or more after chemotherapy) has 
occurred in patients attaining complete emetic control on the day of cisplatin therapy. Diarrhea 
has also been reported. 
 
10.2.11 Other Toxicities : Vascular toxicities coincident with the use of cisplatin in combination with 
other antineoplastic agents have been reported rarely. The events are clinically heterogeneous 
and may include myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, thrombotic microangiopathy 
(HUS), or cerebral arteritis. Various mechanisms have been proposed for these vascular 
complications. There are also reports of Raynaud’s phenomenon occurring in patients treated 
with the combination of bleomycin, vinblastine with or without cisplatin. It has been suggested 
that hypomagnesemia developi[INVESTIGATOR_408900], 
although not essential, factor associated with this event. However, it is currently unknown if 
the cause of Raynaud’s phenomenon in these cases is the disease, underlying vascular 
compromise, bleomycin, vinblastine, hypomagnesemia, or a combination of any of these 
factors.

44 
 10.2.12 Serum Electrolyte Disturbances:  Hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, 
hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia have been reported to occur in patients treated with 
cisplatin and are probably related to renal tubular damage. Tetany has occasionally been 
reported in those patients with hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Generally, administering 
supplemental electrolytes and discontinuing cisplatin restore normal serum electrolyte levels. 
Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome has also been reported. 
 
10.2.13 Hyperuricemia : Hyperuricemia has been reported to occur at approximately the same 
frequency as the increases in BUN and serum creatinine. It is more pronounced after doses 
greater than 50 mg/m2, and peak levels of uric acid generally occur between 3 to 5 days after 
the dose. Allopurinol therapy for hyperuricemia effectively reduces uric acid levels. 
 
10.2.14 Neurotoxicity : Neurotoxicity, usually characterized by [CONTACT_160603], has been 
reported. The neuropathies usually occur after prolonged therapy (4 to 7 months); however, 
neurologic symptoms have been reported to occur after a single dose. Although symptoms and 
signs of cisplatin neuropathy usually develop during treatment, symptoms of neuropathy may 
begin [ADDRESS_515817] observed. The neuropathy, however, may 
progress further even after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. Preliminary evidence suggests peripheral 
neuropathy may be irreversible in some patients. Lhermitte’s sign, dorsal column myelopathy, 
and autonomic neuropathy have also been reported. Loss of taste and seizures have also been 
reported. 
Muscle cramps, defined as localized, painful, involuntary skeletal muscle contractions of 
sudden onset and short duration, have been reported and were usually associated in patients 
receiving a relatively high cumulative dose of cisplatin and with a relatively advanced 
symptomatic stage of peripheral neuropathy. 
 
10.2.15 Ocular Toxicity : Optic neuritis, papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], and cerebral blindness have been reported 
infrequently in patients receiving standard recommended doses of cisplatin. Improvement 
and/or total recovery usually occurs after discontinuing cisplatin. Steroids with or without 
mannitol have been used; however, efficacy has not been established. 
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_515818] been reported after the use of regimens with 
higher doses of cisplatin or greater dose frequencies than those recommended in the package 
insert. The altered color perception manifests as a loss of color discrimination, particularly in 
the blue-yellow axis. The only finding on funduscopic exam is irregular retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_408901]. 
 
10.2.17 Anaphylactic-like Reactions : Anaphylactic- like reactions have been occasionally reported in 
patients previously exposed to cisplatin. The reactions consist of facial edema, wheezing, 
tachycardia, and hypotension within a few minutes of drug administration. Reactions may be 
controlled by [CONTACT_408920][INVESTIGATOR_408902]/or antihistamines as indicated. Patients 
receiving cisplatin should be observed carefully for possible anaphylactic- like reactions and 
supportive equipment and medication should be available to treat such a complication. 
 
10.2.18 Hepatotoxicity : Transient elevations of liver enzymes, especially SGOT, as well as bilirubin, 
have been reported to be associated with cisplatin administration at the recommended doses. 
 
Hoosier Oncology Group BRE09-146                                                            Version Date 27SEPT2011

45 
 10.2.19 Other Events : Other toxicities reported to occur infrequently are cardiac abnormalities, 
hiccups, elevated serum amylase, and rash. Alopecia, malaise, and asthenia have been reported 
as part of postmarketing surveillance. 
 
Local soft tissue toxicity has rarely been reported following extravasation of cisplatin. Severity 
of the local tissue toxicity appears to be related to the concentration of the cisplatin solution. 
Infusion of solutions with a cisplatin concentration greater than 0.5 mg/mL may result in tissue 
cellulitis, fibrosis, and necrosis. 
 
10.2.20 Pregnancy : Cisplatin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cisplatin 
is mutagenic in bacteria and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue culture. 
In mice, cisplatin is teratogenic and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if 
the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. 
 
10.2.21 Nursing Mothers . Cisplatin has been reported to be found in human milk, patients receiving 
cisplatin should not breastfeed. 
 
 
11.0 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS & SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
11.1  Definitions of Adverse Events 
 
11.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
 Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered an 
investigational product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the treatment.  An adverse event (AE) can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational 
product. 
 
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence resulting in one or more of 
the following: 
• Results in death

the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313],  based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above).  Examples of such events include, but are 
not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic

specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the Investigator's Brochure or 
package insert. 
 
11.2 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting 
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded from the time of consent and for at least 30 days 
after treatment discontinuation, regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered 
related to trial medications.  All AEs considered related to trial medication will be 
followed until resolution, return to baseline, or deemed clinically insignificant, even if 
this occurs post-trial.

information to link records; e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent 
forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_85775]’s, and detailed records of drug disposition.  To comply with 
international regulations, the records should be retained by [CONTACT_408926]. 
 
During data entry, range and missing data checks will be performed on-line.  The checks 
to be performed will be documented in the Data Monitoring Plan for the study.  A 
summary report (QC Report) of these checks together with any queries resulting from 
manual review of the eCRF’s will be generated for each site and transmitted to the site 
and the site monitor.  Corrections will be made by [CONTACT_3991].  This will be 
done on an ongoing basis. 
 
13.3 Changes to the Protocol 
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the Sponsor 
Investigator, Hoosier Oncology Group, and Clovis . 
 
If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended, the amendment or a new version 
of the study protocol (amended protocol) will be generated by [CONTACT_408927], Clovis, and if applicable, also the local 
regulatory authority.  Local requirements must be followed. 
 
If a protocol amendment requires a change to the Written Informed Consent Form, then 
the IRB must be notified.  Approval of the revised Written Informed Consent Form by 
[CONTACT_408928].  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_408904], and to the staff at his or her center.  The distribution of these documents to the 
regulatory authority will be handled according to local practice. 
 
Clovis’s willingness to supply study drug is predicated upon the review of the protocol.  
The Hoosier Oncology Group agrees to provide written notice to Clovis of any 
modifications to the protocol or informed consent. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_515829] of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles originating from the 
Declaration of Helsinki, which are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, and 
applicable regulatory requirements. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_515830] also be notified they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  The patient 
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the 
information provided. 
 
The patient’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting 
any procedure specifically for the study.  The investigator must store the original, signed 
Written Informed Consent Form.  A copy of the signed Written Informed Consent Form 
must be given to the patient.

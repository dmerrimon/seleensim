   Scotopic perimetry in Age-related Macular Degeneration  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Oct 24, [ADDRESS_152578] symptom.  Similarly, a growing body of evidence indicates that rods are affected early in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Stargardt disease. In addition, some of the contemporary treatment strategies are common to these diseases. These treatment strategies require localized outcome measures of rod and cone function to evaluate treatment efficacy.       The MP-1S was the first fundus perimeter to provide highly localized measures of rod and cone function.  It incorporates a fundus-tracking system and follow-up mode to maintain constant stimulus projection on the retina and facilitate repeat testing of identical loci despi[INVESTIGATOR_134715].  The scotopic MAIA is a more recent option for scotopic perimetry.  It provides a faster test, but has a limited dynamic range.  Average normal sensitivity for elderly patients with spot size [ADDRESS_152579] for patients with losses > 1.[ADDRESS_152580] compared 10 patients on both devices. The correlation in mean sensitivity between the two devices is high (r= 0.73) with the Nidek MP-1S having sensitivity on average [ADDRESS_152581] the MP-1S. In general, it is easier to use than the MP-1S. It incorporates a red screen that does not interfere with the dark adaptation of the patient. Other advances include “fade-out-protection” for the fixation light to avoid the Troxler effect, which is particularly common in an otherwise dark field. Rather than the joystick on the MP-1S for aligning the patient, the MP-3S actively tracks the pupil position of the patient. Another important advantage of the MP-3S is the higher luminance of the background for standard testing.  The 34 cd/m2 background is [ADDRESS_152582].  Representative normal sensitivity maps for 2 different spot sizes on the MP-3S are shown in Figure 1.  For spot size 3, the values are comparable but slightly higher than for elderly subjects tested on the MP-1S (7 corresponds to 27 on the MP-1S, given the 2.0 log filter).  For the larger spot size 5, values are considerably higher consistent with spatial summation.  It is also important to point out that the range over which patients can be tested can be varied by [CONTACT_134716].  There is a tradeoff between the greater spatial localization with spot size [ADDRESS_152583]      In order to compare results from patients on the MP-3S to those from the MP-1S, we tested 10 patients with age-related macular degeneration using the following parameters:    Table [ADDRESS_152584] loci  32    32 Spot size  5    5 Filter  Internal   Blue+ 2.[ADDRESS_152585] Staircase  4:2    4:2   

The patients will be greater than 55 years of age.  Each patient will be evaluated with the following procedures: • Best-corrected visual acuity of both eyes  • Slit lamp examination to screened for a narrow angle prior to dilation • Pupil dilation with 30 minutes patching for dark-adapted testing of the better seeing eye  • Dark-adapted visual field test on Nidek microperimeter, model MP-3S using a protocol that takes approximately 20 minutes • Dark-adapted visual field test on Nidek microperimeter, model MP-1S using a protocol that takes approximately 20 minutes • Imaging on Heidelberg Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography and fundus autofluorescence unit  MP-3S and MP-1S testing order will be randomized and both tests will be conducted on the same day. Coefficients of repeatability will be obtained for each test and compared to the literature.  We will determine the range of values for point sensitivity to determine the amount that a patient has to change at a given location to be significant.  The limits of agreement for the two devices measuring scotopic sensitivity will be compared to limits of agreement for mesopic testing.  Appendix

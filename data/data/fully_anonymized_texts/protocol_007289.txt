Trial Duration 28 weeks Number of Subjects 350 to 440 
Trial Design Randomized, multicenter, double-blind, controlled, parallel group 
Primary 
Objective(s): To determine whether inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is superior to 
control (50 mg b.i.d.) for improving lung function as measured by

 Non-h
ierarchical secondary objectives 
To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol 
(400 mg b.i.d.) is superior to control  
• for decreasing the incidence of exacerbations (i.e. the proportion 
of subjects with one or more exacerbation); 
• for improving ease of expectoration; and  
• for improving subject reported respi[INVESTIGATOR_51772]-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_1798]. 
Primary 
Endpoint(s): The primary endpoint is the mean change in FEV 1 (mL) from 
basel
ine (Visit 1) over the 26-week treatment period (to Visit 4). 
Secondary 
Endpoints: • Mean change from baseline FVC (mL) over the 26-week 
treatment period; 
• Time to first pulmonary exacerbation over the 26-week treatment 
period; 
• Rate of pulmonary exacerbations over the 26-week treatment 
period; 
• Number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51773]; 
• The incidence of pulmonary exacerbations; 
• Number of days on antibiotics (oral, inhaled or IV) due to 
pulmonary exacerbation; 
• Ease of expectoration measured using a visual analogue scale; 
and 
• CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_51774]. 
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that inhaled mannitol 400 mg b.i.d. will increase the 
mean change from baseline FEV 1 (mL) compared to control over the 
26-wee
k treatment period in adult subjects with cystic fibrosis.  For 
the purposes of determining an appropriate sample size for statistical 
power while retaining trial feasibility in an orphan disease population 
the trial is powered to detect a difference of 80 mL, however any 
improvement in FEV 1 could be considered clinically meaningful.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Backgr
ound 
Cys
tic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by [CONTACT_51831] (CFTR) [1].  It is 
characterized by [CONTACT_51832], failure to thrive and pulmonary disease [2].  
Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening and chronically debilitating disease that markedly impairs 
quality of life [1].  To date, there are more than 1,600 specific mutations in the CF gene that 
are known [3].  The incidence of CF varies by [CONTACT_51833], with the greatest incidence 
occurring in Caucasians (1:3,200).  Far less people of African or Asian descent have this 
disease (incidence between 1:15,000 and 1:31,000) [2].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_51781], the 
prevalence of CF is likely to increase as the median survival time for subjects with CF 
increases [2]. 
Chronic progressive lung disease is the main negative prognostic factor in CF subjects [3].  
Subjects have progressive cycles of infection and inflammation, ultimately leading to 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] [2].  The lungs become colonized with bacteria, probably due to the 
presence of thick, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_51782], which traps inhaled microbes [2]. 
Cystic fibrosis has no cure.  Current life expectancy is between 30 and 40 years [1], although 
life expectancy is related to phenotype, with those with severe phenotypes having reduced 
life expectancy.  The goal of therapy is to delay disease progression [1].  The goal of therapy 
with respect to pulmonary disease is to maintain or improve respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], as assessed 
by [CONTACT_51834][INVESTIGATOR_31737] (FEV 1) [1].  Slowing the decline of lung function 
occur s
 by [CONTACT_51835], by [CONTACT_51836][INVESTIGATOR_51783] [1].  Clearing mucus occurs using physical techniques, 
such as active cycle of breathing, positive pressure autogenic drainage and physical therapy.  
Currently available pharmacological treatments include therapy with mucolytic drugs to 
improve mucociliary clearance of lower-airway secretions and treat chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease [1].  Mucus clearance can be increased using hypertonic saline solutions 
[1], while rhDNase is used as a mucolytic agent.  Inhaled mannitol is being developed as a 
therapeutic agent for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and other diseases characterized by 
[CONTACT_51837], thickened respi[INVESTIGATOR_51784].  Inhaled mannitol has been shown to increase 
mucociliary clearance and cough clearance [4, 5]. The exact mechanisms responsible remain 
unclear, however, due to its osmotic activity a combination of factors including changes in 
the rheology of mucus favoring ciliary and cough clearance may be responsible [6-8].  
Osmotic agents may change the viscoelastic properties of mucus by [CONTACT_51838].  While ionic agents may achieve this by [CONTACT_51839], non-ionic agents such as mannitol may 
achieve this by [CONTACT_51840] [6, 9]. Osmotic agents also 
increase the amount of water in the airway lumen potentially normalizing the airway surface 
liquid layer. This increased hydration may contribute to an increase in the activity of cilia 
and transportability of mucus. Additionally, osmotic agents may increase clearance of mucus 
by [CONTACT_51841]. The effect of osmolarity on mucus secretion could be direct 
or indirect via release of mediators from epi[INVESTIGATOR_51785]. Although an increase in mucus 
secretion is not seen to be a desirable effect, this stimulation of mucus secretion may help 
increase clearance of viscous and stagnated mucus.  
 
DPM-CF-[ADDRESS_54733] function irrespective of age. 
While adult subjects (aged at least 18 years) have been studied in previous phase III clinical 
trials of inhaled mannitol that assessed improvements in lung function [10, 11], there are 
remaining uncertainties around the effect size of inhaled mannitol 400 mg b.i.d. in this 
population. 
Therefore the primary purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy of inhaled mannitol 
compared with control in subjects with cystic fibrosis aged 18 years and above. 
1.1.1 Findings from non-clinical trials 
Information regarding the findings from Non-Clinical Studies is presented in the 
Investigator’s Brochure  Section NONCLINICAL STUDIES.   
Mannitol is present naturally in plants, algae, fungi and some bacteria.  It is used extensively 
as a food additive.  It does not appear to be mutagenic, cytotoxic, carcinogenic or 
teratogenic.  One trial has shown increased incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia plus 
pheochromocytoma in rats.  However, these were not dose related and were considered 
unrelated to the administration of mannitol. 
When ingested, mannitol has a laxative effect when given in doses greater than 10 to 20 g.  
The accepted daily intake of mannitol set by [CONTACT_51842] / WHO expert committee on food 
additives (JECFA) is 50 mg/kg. It is unlikely however, that the inhalation of less than 1g of 
mannitol per day via inhalation would reach this level. 
In animals, mannitol is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_51786] (peaking within 1 hour of 
completion of the dose), with negligible serum levels detected after 24 hours. 
1.1.2 Findings from clinical trials 
Findings from clinical studies are discussed in detail in the Investigator’s Brochure , section 
EFFECTS IN HUMANS.

macokinetics 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (see Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 6.1.2). 
1.1.4 Efficacy 
The DPM-CF-301 trial [10] assessed the safety and efficacy of inhaled mannitol [ADDRESS_54734] of 
mannitol was superior to that of control (p < 0.001, Table 1).  Changes in other measures of 
lung function (FVC and FEF 25-75) were consistent with the improvements in FEV 1. 
DPM -
CF-302 [11] was essentially the same as DPM-CF-301 in design, with only minor 
differences in the inclusion / exclusion criteria.  In this trial, inhaled dry powder mannitol 
improved absolute change in FEV 1 compared with control over six-month treatment period, 
althoug
h this failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.059, Table 1).  However, there 
were significant improvements in the relative change in FEV 1 when subjects were treated 
with m
annitol were compared to control groups – a difference of 3.75% (p = 0.029). 
A pooled analysis of DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 studies found a mean absolute change 
from baseline in FEV 1 for dry powder mannitol versus control over 6 months was 73.4 mL 
(p<0.001). 
 Overall the studies show that dry powder mannitol improves lung function by [CONTACT_51843], and the improvement was sustained over 26 weeks. The increase in FEV 1 at six 
weeks
 was highly correlated with the improvement over the 26-week treatment period.

Detailed description on the safety of inhaled dry powder mannitol in subjects with cystic 
fibrosis can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure , section SAFETY IN BRONCHITOL 
CLINICAL TRIALS. 
A total of [ADDRESS_54736] frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were cough (9.23 %), condition 
aggravated (cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation) (6.10 %) and hemoptysis (5.36 %).  
Cough was very common (> 1/10), condition aggravated and hemoptysis were common 
(frequency ≥  1/100, < 1/10). 
Other common ADRs (frequency ≥ 1/100, < 1/10) were: pharyngolaryngeal pain, headache, 
wheezing, bronchospasm, productive cough, throat irritation, post-tussive vomiting and 
vomiting, chest discomfort, upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], and bacteria 
identified in the sputum.

2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 
2.1 Pri
mary objective 
To det
ermine whether inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is superior to control (50 mg b.i.d.) 
for im
proving lung function as measured by [CONTACT_51828] 1 (mL) over the 
26-wee
k treatment period in adult subjects with CF. 
2.2 Secondary objectives 
Ther
e are hierarchical and non-hierarchical secondary objectives.  Analysis of hierarchical 
secondar
y objectives will continue until a non-significant p-value (i.e. p > 0.05) is returned. 
2.2.1 Hierarchical secondary objectives 
1. To determine whether inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is superior to control for 
improving lung function as measured by [CONTACT_51829] (mL) over 
the 26-week treatment period in adult subjects with CF. 
2. To determine whether inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is superior to control in 
increasing the time to first pulmonary exacerbation over the 26-week treatment 
period in adult subjects with CF. 
3. To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is 
superior to control for reducing the number of days on antibiotics (oral, inhaled or 
IV) due to pulmonary exacerbation;  
4. To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is 
superior to control for decreasing the number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51771]; and  
5. To determine whether inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) decreases the rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations over the 26-week treatment period compared to control in 
adult subjects with CF. 
2.2.2 Non-hierarchical secondary objectives 
To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is superior 
to control  
• for decreasing the incidence of exacerbations (i.e. the proportion of subjects with one 
or more exacerbation); 
• for improving ease of expectoration; and  
• for improving subject reported respi[INVESTIGATOR_51787]-R 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1798]. 
2.3 Hypothesis 
We 
hypothesize that inhaled mannitol 400 mg b.i.d. will increase the mean change from 
basel
ine FEV 1 (mL) compared to control over the 26-week treatment period in adult subjects 
with 
cystic fibrosis. Any improvement in FEV 1 is considered clinically meaningful, 
however
, this trial has set a threshold of 80 mL for the purposes of determining an 
appropriate sample size for statistical power while retaining trial feasibility in an orphan 
disease population.

4 OVERVIEW OF TRIAL DESIGN 
4.1 Trial de
sign 
This
 is a double-blind, randomized, parallel arm, controlled, multicenter, and interventional 
clini
cal trial.  Potential subjects will sign the informed consent form (ICF) and be assessed 
for eligibility.  After satisfying all inclusion & exclusion criteria, subjects will be given a 
mannitol tolerance test (MTT). Those subjects that pass the MTT will be randomized to 
receive inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) or control b.i.d. for a period of 26-weeks, in a 1:1 
fashion (See trial flowchart in Figure 1). Note: No tests should be performed before consent 
is obtained (also refer to the TIME AND EVENTS schedule).

[ADDRESS_54741] (IMP) 
6.1  Dosage
 and administration 
This
 is a parallel trial, including 26 weeks of treatment with either inhaled mannitol (400 mg 
b.i.d.) or
 control (mannitol 50 mg b.i.d.).  The inhalation technique for control and mannitol 
is identical. 
WHEN TO START TREATMENT FOR SUBJECTS WITH A 
CURRENT PULMONARY EXACERBATION 
Subjects should be stable and clear of pulmonary exacerbations for at 
least two weeks prior to visit 1. If a subject has an exacerbation after Visit 
0 (screening), Visit [ADDRESS_54742] can receive additional treatment as required. 
The IMP is to be administered in a standardized manner (see Figure 2).  The Investigator is 
responsible for instructing the subject on the correct IMP inhalation technique, and on use of 
the bronchodilator (albuterol/salbutamol metered dose inhaler (MDI) or similar) [ADDRESS_54743] with a bronchodilator (albuterol /salbutamol 
metered dose inhaler [MDI] or similar) to be used as premedication prior to inhalation of the 
IMP.  This bronchodilator may also be used in the event of post-treatment chest tightness.  
Premedication (albuterol/salbutamol MDI or preferred alternative) should be recorded in the 
Subject Diary .  Use of any bronchodilator following IMP for post-treatment chest tightness 
should also be recorded in the Subject Diary . 
Subjects will take IMP twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.  The 
evening dose should be administered approximately 2 hours before sleep.   
The recommended order of treatment procedures is: 
1. bronc hodi
lator; 
2. mannitol/control; 
3. physiotherapy / exercise*; 
4. rhDNase; 
5. inhaled antibiotics; then 
6. inhaled corticosteroids. 
The procedures 4, [ADDRESS_54744] always precede 
mannitol/control.

 *Whe
n possible, individual physiotherapy and exercise (if used as a substitute to 
physiotherapy) techniques and routines should be kept consistent throughout the study. 
Subjects should record in the Subject Diary  the date of any missed doses of IMP. 
Each kit dispensed contains additional supply to account for the allowed visit windows. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_54745] has 
missed doses of their medication, then they should be counseled about the importance of 
compliance, and re-educated on investigational medication intake.  Any possible treatment 
discontinuation due to non-adherence should be discussed with the Sponsor’s Project 
Manager and Sponsor’s Medical Director. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_54746] – formulation and manufacture 
Bronchitol has a centralized European marketing authorization for use in Adult patients with 
cystic fibrosis. However it does not have a marketing authorization or is not available in 
every participating country therefore it is being treated as Investigational medicinal 
product.  Details on the investigational product can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure .  
Trial treatment (mannitol and control) will be provided as indistinguishable red capsules. 
6.1.3 Labeling, packaging and storage 
IMP is labeled according to local regulatory requirements. The mannitol dry powder is 
encapsulated in opaque capsules prior to blister packing in aluminum foil. Blisters are 
contained within cartons with a dry powder inhaler device(s). IMP blinding is maintained by 
[CONTACT_51848]. 
IMP is to be stored at room temperature (59°F to 77°F or 15°C to 25°C), in a secure area 
with restricted access.  The site Investigator/Pharmacist is responsible for storage, 
temperature monitoring and maintaining accurate accountability records. 
Once the IMP has been dispensed to subjects, it must not be refrigerated, nor kept in humid 
conditions, such as in the bathroom.  IMP must be stored at room temperature, in a clean, 
dry, environment.  Capsules should only be removed from the foil packaging immediately 
prior to use. 
 
Important: Instruct your subjects the IMP can only be used with the 
inhaler provided. 
  

 
DPM-CF-[ADDRESS_54747] from the Sponsor 
are correctly received by a responsible person (e.g., Pharmacist), that all receipts are 
recorded in writing, that the product is stored in a secure area under recommended and 
proper storage conditions, and that they are used in accordance with the protocol.  It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the integrity of the investigational medication 
is not jeopardized prior to dispensing.  The investigational medication must be dispensed as 
provided by [CONTACT_51849].  
The site Pharmacist / Investigator(s) / legally qualified designee, as documented on the Site 
Signature / Delegation of Authority Log, will dispense/administer the investigational 
medication only to subjects enrolled in this trial following the procedures set out in Section 
6. The site Pharmacist / Investigator(s) is responsible for assuring the retrieval of all trial 
supplies from the subjects.  Unused investigational medication(s) (opened, unopened, or 
empty capsules) must be returned to the Sponsor or destroyed on site (if appropriate) after 
the investigational medication accountability has been completed and destruction has been 
authorized by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Trial drug accountability should be performed by [CONTACT_51850] (empty blisters) and 
unused trial drug remaining in blisters. 
The Investigator(s) must maintain accurate and adequate records including dates of receipt 
and return of IMP shipments, and batch numbers and quantities received/returned from/to 
Pharmaxis, as well as dates and amounts dispensed to/returned by [CONTACT_51851]. Destruction 
of trial supplies should not be done without prior approval from the Sponsor.  Full 
accountability documentation (with witnessing) is required for all destroyed IMP at an 
investigator site. 
The Investigator / site Pharmacist will be required to provide the Monitor with access to the 
investigational medication and records for periodic review.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_51790]. 
It is forbidden to use investigational medication for purposes other than defined in this 
protocol. 
6.[ADDRESS_54748]’s welfare may be given at the 
discr
etion of the Investigator.  Administration of all concomitant medications must be 
reported in the appropriate section of the CRF as noted below.  Generic names are to be 
recorded, along with the start and stop dates, dose, frequency, route and indication.  Trade 
names are acceptable for combination medications.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Res
cue medications 
If a subject develops chest tightness or shortness of breath as a consequence of withholding 
bronchodilators or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_51791], they should 
take their usual bronchodilator and phone or attend the clinic for advice.  Where the health of 
the subject is in question, the subject should attend the clinic for assessment.  Note should be 
made of the event precipi[INVESTIGATOR_51792].  If necessary the due visit should be rescheduled. 
6.2.4 Prohibited medications and non-pharmacological treatments 
The following medications are prohibited from Screening (Visit 0) and throughout the trial 
protocol period: 
• Maintenance treatment with nebulized hypertonic saline 
• Non-selective oral beta-blockers 
7 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICATION TREATMENT ALLOCATION 
Subje
cts will be randomized following informed consent and satisfying all the inclusion and 
none of 
the exclusion criteria.  Subjects are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
inhaled mannitol 400 mg b.i.d. or control (inhaled mannitol 50 mg b.i.d.) for a period of 26-
weeks. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_51852]. 
The Pharmacist, Investigator or legally responsible designee will dispense the treatment 
allocated to the subject and record the randomized kit numbers in the dispensing log. 
The subject, the investigative staff and Sponsor will be blinded to the treatment allocation. 
Appropriate site staff will be provided with access to unblinding information. In the event of 
a medical emergency, and when management of a subject’s condition requires knowledge of 
the IMP, his/her randomization information may be obtained. Such emergencies should be 
discussed with the Sponsor in advance whenever possible prior to disclosure of the subject’s 
treatment allocation. An automatic email is sent to the designated trial team member as soon 
as the subject is unblinded. 
Any subject giving consent, but not fulfilling the criteria to participate in the trial  will not be 
entered into the Case Report Form (CRF) with the exception of mannitol tolerance test 
(MTT) status.  Subjects giving consent but not entered into the CRF will be documented as 
screen failures.  Subjects who are administered the MTT should be entered onto the CRF 
irrespective of the MTT result; however, the subject’s trial identifier and date of birth will be 
detailed in the IWRS.

• Obtain demographic information:  
o date of birth; 
o height and weight (no shoes using a stadiometer); 
o race and gender; 
o age at diagnosis; 
o CFTR mutation  (if known)*; and 
o previous diagnosis of CF related bronchiectasis (yes, no, unknown)*. 
• Review medical history; 
• Review and record concomitant medications for the previous 3 months; 
• Perform physical examination, including but not limited to: 
o pulmonary function tests (FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 % predicted  PEF, FEF 25-75 ); 
o urine
 pregnancy test (for females of child-bearing potential); and 
o physical examination / vital signs (including chest sounds, weight, BP, HR, 
O2 saturation, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]). 
• Premedicate with four puffs of albuterol/salbutamol from a metered dose inhaler 
(MDI
) (360-400µg) **; 
• Conduct mannitol tolerance test (MTT) (see section [IP_ADDRESS]); 
• Col
lect 1 x sputum sample for qualitative microbiology (sent to local lab); 
alternatively, an oropharyngeal or cough swab is permitted. 
• Collect blood sample for hematology, electrolytes, urea, creatinine and liver function 
testing (collected following local laboratory procedures and sent to local lab); and 
• Issue subject diary and instruct the subject on how to complete it. 
* Enter this data only if known and confirmed evidence is available.  
** B
ronchodilator is to be used approximately 5 -15 minutes prior to MTT. The default bronchodilator for this 
trial is 4 x puffs albuterol/salbutamol (360-400 µg). However, the subject’s preferred alternative 
bronchodilator may be used as an alternative premedication. Please record premedication details. 
 
Re-s
creening of subjects may be considered upon approval by [CONTACT_51853].  Re-

[IP_ADDRESS] Mannitol tolerance test (MTT) 
The 
MTT identifies subjects who have airway hyperresponsiveness in response to inhaled 
mannitol. Airway hyperresponsiveness is determined by [CONTACT_51854]. 
As is standard in administering agents that have the potential to cause 
bronchoconstriction, a physician, appropriately trained, to treat acute 
bronchospasm, including the use of resuscitation equipment, must  be available 
to respond to an emergency. 
As a minimum, the person conducting the MTT procedure must: 
• Be competent/trained, qualified and experienced in performing bronchial provocation 
tests; 
• Be familiar with safety and emergency procedures; 
• Know when to stop further testing; 
• Be proficient in the administration of inhaled bronchodilators and other rescue 
medications and equipment; and 
• Not be the same person who administers IMP in the clinic  
The following equipment must be available during the MTT procedure: 
• MTT kit with a dry powder inhaler; 
• Bronchodilator metered dose inhalers and spacers; 
• A spi[INVESTIGATOR_51793]/ERS requirements; 
• Calculator and 60 second timer; 
• Pulse oximeter; 
• Adrenaline, atropi[INVESTIGATOR_51794]; and  
• Resuscitation equipment.

expectoration over the previous week using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (0 = very difficult; 
10 = very easy). 
8.3 Safety 
Saf
ety assessments are highlighted in the  TIM E AND EVENTS SCHEDULE. 
8.3.1 Safety evaluations 
Any clinically significant change in safety evaluation will be recorded as an adverse event 
(AE) as detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
  
 
DPM-CF-303 Protocol v2.0 13th October 2014 
Page
 46 of 72  Confidential  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adve
rse events (AEs) 
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational medicinal product(s) will be recorded on the Adverse Event  
page of the CRF.  Subjects will be questioned for the occurrence of any new or worsening 
signs or symptoms at each visit by [CONTACT_51856]: 
• Information volunteered by [CONTACT_423]; 
• Open ended and non-leading questions such as: Have you had any health problems 
since your last visit?; 
• Observation by [CONTACT_51857], other care providers or relatives; or  
• Medical Record and Subject Diary  review. 
The appropriate clinical individual at the trial site provides assessment and treatment of any 
trial related medical emergencies involving trial subjects.  
Please refer to Section 8.3.3 for further details on AE reporting procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical laboratory tests 
Sputum microbiology, and screening bloods (hematology, electrolytes, urea, creatinine and 
liver function tests) are the only laboratory tests required for this trial protocol.  Laboratory 
tests are performed and analyzed following the local laboratory’s standard procedures.  If any 
other routine clinical laboratory testing is performed and a clinically significant result is 
obtained, then this must be recorded as an AE (see Section 8.3.3).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital signs 
Temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_51807]. 
Temperature should be taken at the same site each visit (e.g. oral, tympanic, or axillary). 
Blood pressure will be assessed seated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical examination 
Physical examinations will be as per the TIME AND EVENTS SCHEDULE.  A physician 
should preferably conduct the physical examination, but where timing prohibits this, a 
suitably trained nurse may undertake this task.  The physician should be consulted if any 
abnormality in the examination is detected. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy testing 
Perform urine pregnancy tests at screening on all females of child-bearing potential. Subjects 
who are pregnant are excluded from the trial. Female subjects who are at risk of becoming 
pregnant are expected to prevent pregnancy occurring while on treatment by [CONTACT_51858] e.g. oral contraceptive, condom, IUD, injectable contraceptive, or 
diaphragm. Male subjects have no contraceptive restrictions. 
The Investigator will inform the Sponsor immediately of any case of pregnancy and collect 
information on any subject who becomes pregnant during the trial using the Pregnancy 
Report Form . Discontinue pregnant subjects from treatment but continue to follow-up for

ed safety assessments for the duration of the trial. Subjects will also be followed to 
determine the outcome of pregnancy.  See also section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
8.3.2 Criteria 
An assessment of safety will be made on the basis of reviewing changes in physical 
examination, spi[INVESTIGATOR_51808]. 
8.3.3 Adverse event reporting 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions 
Adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (for example an abnormal 
laboratory finding), a symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to that product. 
Any worsening (e.g. clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a 
pre-existing condition, which is temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, is 
also considered an AE. Recurring symptoms associated with pre-existing conditions will not  
be considered AEs during the trial, unless they have a clinically significant increase in 
severity and/or frequency. 
 Hemoptysis is an event of special interest in this trial and should be reported as a 
separate Adverse Event every time it occurs, even if it is considered to be a 
component of a pulmonary exacerbation and/or if it is an ongoing / intermittent 
medical history condition.

 Seri
ous adverse event (SAEs) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) for this trial is defined as any unfavorable medical occurrence 
that at any dose:  
1) Results in death  
 
2) Is life-threatening 
NOTE:  the term “life-threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51809]: The following do not meet the definition of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51810]: 
• An Emergency Department visit that did not result in an admission to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14150] 
• Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51811]’s entry into the trial, unless the subject experiences an additional AE 
that prolongs the pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51812]’s CRF medical record page at screening 
(Visit 0). 
 
4) Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 
5) Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 
6) Other important medical event  
NOTE: Appropriate medical judgment should be exercised for important medical 
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51813]. These should usually be 
considered serious .

 [IP_ADDRESS] Caus
ality assessment 
The Investigator will make a causality assessment according to his/her best judgment.  The 
following criteria can be used as a guidance to assess the causal relationship.  These are not 
definitive, but presented as examples. 
Definitely related: 
• There is evidence of exposure to the investigational medication or procedure 
• The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational medication or procedure is reasonable 
• The SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_51859] 
• De-challenge (if performed) is positive 
• Re-challenge (if feasible and if performed) is positive 
• The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the investigational 
medication  or investigational medication   class 
Probably related: 
• There is evidence of exposure to the investigational medication or procedure 
• The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational medication or procedure is reasonable 
• The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_51860]

Possibly related: 
• There is evidence of exposure to the investigational medication or a protocol 
procedure 
• The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational medication or procedure is reasonable 
• The AE could have been due to another equally likely cause 
• De-challenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous

 • Ther
e is evidence of exposure to the investigational medication or protocol procedure 
• There is another more likely cause of the AE 
• De-challenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous 
• Re-challenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous 
Definitely not related:  
• The subject did not receive the investigational medication or undergone any protocol 
procedure  
• Temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the investigational 
medication or procedure is not reasonable  
• There is another obvious cause of the AE 
• De-challenge (if performed) is negative 
• Re-challenge (if performed) is negative 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity assessment 
Mild: the subject has an  awareness of a sign or symptom, but it is easily tolerated and does 
not alter normal activity 
Moderate:  the sign or symptom causes discomfort and/or interference with the subject’s 
usual activity 
Severe: the sign or symptom causes significant impairment of function or incapacitation, 
and/or the subject is unable to perform usual activities 
8.3.4 Reporting procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS] All adverse events 
The Investigator will assess all AEs and record details of seriousness (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), 
severity (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), duration, action taken with the investigational medication, and 
relationship to the investigational medication (causality, see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The 
Investigator will also record details of de-challenge and re-challenge with the investigational 
medication. 
All adverse events that meet any of the serious criteria defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be 
reported as SAEs. 
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be reported from signing of the informed consent form 
until [ADDRESS_54770]’s medical records and in the CRF.  AEs that occur in subjects who have screen failed 
and are not entered into the CRF will be captured on the AE Reporting Log in the 
Investigator Site File. All SAEs that occur in subjects who have screen failed will be reported 
from informed consent.  
The Sponsor is responsible for reporting AEs to the relevant regulatory authorities according 
to international and local regulations applicable to this trial.    
The Investigator is responsible for reporting AEs to the appropriate IEC that approved the 
protocol, as required and documented by [CONTACT_6179]. 
Pulmonary exacerbations are expected to occur as part of the disease but will be recorded as 
adverse events. Expedited reporting of serious exacerbations to Regulators and Ethics 
Committees will only be carried out if the exacerbation is considered to be related to trial 
drug and is clinically different to that normally expected in a particular subject (e.g. more 
severe). In such cases, the difference should be noted on the AE form.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse events 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_51814] [ADDRESS_54771] make an assessment of causality (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and severity (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) of all SAEs.  All actions taken and outcomes must also be recorded. 
The SAE Report Form should be completed and forwarded to:  
 
 
 
SAEs will be followed up until the event has resolved and the report is assessed as complete; 
or the subject is lost to follow-up.  In addition, an Investigator may be requested by 
[CONTACT_51861]-up information in an expedited 
fashion for the purposes of full safety assessment. 
All follow-up information should be reported as described above.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Pregn
ancy 
Pregnancy is not usually considered an SAE or an AE.    
If an Investigator becomes aware that a subject, or the sexual partner of a male subject, 
becomes pregnant while they are participating in the trial or within the 7-day post trial 
follow-up period they will notify Pharmaxis immediately.   
A Pregnancy Report Form  should be completed and be forwarded to;  
 
 
 
Female subjects who become pregnant will be withdrawn from treatment but will continue to 
be followed up for scheduled safety assessments for the duration of the trial. 
All pregnancies should be followed to term and the outcome reported to Pharmaxis.  In the 
case of a pregnancy in the sexual partner of a male subject consent will be sought from the 
partner to obtain follow-up information. 
If a subject or baby [CONTACT_51862] 8.3.

9.[ADDRESS_54773] will be withdrawn from the trial for any of the following reasons: 
• Loss to follow-up; 
• Withdrawal of consent; 
• The subject’s attending physician requests that the subject be withdrawn from the 
trial; or

 • The I
nvestigator or the Sponsor, for any reason, stops the trial or stops the subject 
participating in the trial. 
Protocol deviations will not lead to automatic withdrawal unless they indicate a significant 
risk to the subject’s safety.  All protocol deviations must be discussed promptly with the 
Sponsor. 
All subjects who are withdrawing from the trial will attend their next scheduled visit.  This 
should be within two weeks of administration of the last dose of IMP.  A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the subject’s withdrawal should be made and an explanation be 
given as to why the subject is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the trial.  The reason and 
date of withdrawal must be noted on the CRF.  If the reason for withdrawal is an AE or a 
clinically significant laboratory test result, monitoring will continue until resolution or until 
an appropriate medical judgment concerning the cause or importance has been made.  The 
specific event or test result(s) must be recorded on the CRF.

 subjects will yield 90 % power at the 0.[ADDRESS_54776] deviation from both 
DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 studies in subjects with baseline FEV 1 of more than 40% but 
less

 previous 
studies, and were highly influenced by a few outlying values.  In addition, the 
present trial (DPM-CF-303) will be conducted at different sites and in different countries to 
the previous studies.  Thus there is some uncertainty as to what the observed standard 
deviation is likely to be in this trial (DPM-CF-303). For these reasons a sample size re-
estimation is planned to be completed after at least [ADDRESS_54777] been recruited and will 
be based on all available 26-week data. This blinded sample size re-estimation will be based 
on the method of Kieser and Friede [15] which preserves the overall type 1 error rate. 
Therefore no adjustments to the overall significance level for the trial is required.  See 
Section 10.1.5 for more information. 
  
10.1.2 Analysis sets 
[IP_ADDRESS] Intention to treat (ITT) analysis set 
The ITT analysis set (also known as the Full Analysis Set) will include all subjects who were 
randomized to treatment. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which 
they were randomized. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Per protocol (PP) analysis set 
The per protocol analysis set consists of all randomized subjects, who have: 
• Strictly met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria (i.e. will exclude those subjects 
who have been granted an exception to be included in the trial); 
• No major protocol deviations which would affect efficacy evaluations; 
• Taken trial drug for at least 60% of the 26-week treatment period; 
• A valid baseline FEV 1 measure; and  
• At le
ast two valid assessments of FEV 1 following the baseline visit (Visit 0). 
The dec
ision to include subjects in the per protocol dataset will be made prior to unblinding 
of the randomization schedule. For the per protocol analysis any non-valid assessments of 
FEV [ADDRESS_54778]-baseline FEV 1 assessments. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safet
y analysis set 
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who received at least one dose (or part 
thereof) of randomized trial treatment. Subjects will be analyzed in the treatment group based 
on the treatment they received. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mannitol Tolerance Test (MTT) analysis set 
The MTT set will include all subjects participating in the mannitol tolerance test prior to 
randomisation regardless of their subsequent randomisation status. It includes subjects who 
fail the MTT (MTT positive) or who have an incomplete procedure, along with those who 
pass the MTT (MTT negative).   
10.1.[ADDRESS_54779] has missing baseline data, where possible, the screening (Visit 0) value will 
be used.

Baseline characteristics will be described using the safety population.  If required, these may 
also be produced for the intent to treat analysis set (ITT). Demographics, medical history and 
other baseline variables will be summarized as appropriate to the type of data. 
10.2 Efficacy analysis 
10.2.1 Pri
mary objective 
To dete
rmine whether inhaled mannitol (400mg b.i.d.) is superior to control for improving 
lung function as measured by [CONTACT_51828] 1 (mL) over the 26-week 
treat
ment period in adult subjects (18 years or older) with CF. 
10.2.2 Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the mean change from baseline FEV 1 (mL) measured at weeks 6, 14 
and 26. 
10.2.3 Pri
mary analysis 
The mean absolute change from baseline FEV 1 (mL) over weeks 6, 14 and 26 will be 
compare
d between the two treatment groups with a REML based repeated measures 
approach.  
Analyses will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, rhDNase use, country, visit, 
and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline 
percent predicted FEV 1. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the 
within-
subject errors. 
The planned primary efficacy model will take the form: 
 
Significance tests will be based on least-squares means using a two-sided 0.05 significance 
level.  Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be computed.  
 
Change in % predicted FEV 1, relative change in FEV 1 (% change) and relative change in % 
predic t
ed FEV 1 will also be analyzed using the primary model. 
10.2.4 Prim
ary analysis – missing data 
Subjects who discontinue drug treatment will remain in the trial and continue to provide all 
scheduled FEV 1 measurements. While all efforts will be made to ensure subjects remain in 
the tr
ial, the following planned imputation strategy will allow for an appropriate primary 
analysis in the presence of missing FEV 1 data. 
Missi
ng baseline (Visit 1) measurements for the primary efficacy variable (FEV 1) will be 
imputed us
ing screening (Visit 0) values, if available. 
Missing post-baseline measurements for the primary efficacy variable (FEV 1) will be 
imputed 
utilizing an Imputation Using Dropout Reason (IUDR) methodology.  For subjects 
who discontinue due to safety, tolerability, lack of efficacy or were lost to follow-up, missing 
post-baseline FEV 1 measures will be imputed using the baseline (Visit 1) FEV 1 measurement 
(base l

Imputation of missing FEV [ADDRESS_54780] over 26 weeks as observed in all randomized subjects. 
10.2.5  Primary sensitivity analyses 
The following planned sensitivity analyses are intended to gain insights into how different 
analytical assumptions influence the results of the planned primary analysis.  Depending on 
the extent and pattern of withdrawals and “missingness” further sensitivity analyses in 
additional to those given below may be performed. If necessary, further details will be 
provided in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary sensitivity analysis #1:  
To elicit insights into the effect of imputation via the planned BOCF + IUDR framework the 
primary analyses will be repeated with no explicit imputation of missing post-baseline FEV 1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pri
mary sensitivity analysis #2: 
To elicit insights into the effects of including data from subjects after cessation of trial 
treatment (by [CONTACT_51863], the effects of subsequent therapy are attributed to trial 
treatment), the primary analyses will be repeated excluding these data both with imputation 
of missing (and excluded) post-baseline FEV 1 assessments and without explicit imputation. 
Data
 from IMP discontinuation visit or early withdrawal from the study that has been 
collected will be examined here also. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary sensitivity analysis #3: 
Sensitivity of the primary result to choice of “across weeks 6 to 26” versus “at week 26” 
estimates of the treatment effect will be gauged by [CONTACT_51864] 26 for the purposes of comparison. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary sensitivity analysis #4:  
A potential disadvantage of employing a single imputation method such as BOCF is the risk 
of artificially attenuating the natural variability in the longitudinal data. To gauge the possible 
impact of this effect, a two-sample t-test at week 26 will be undertaken computing point 
estimates from the data with BOCF but computing variation only from subjects who 
completed the trial . Furthermore a non-parametric equivalent (e.g. Wilcoxon rank sum test) 
will be undertaken on the data with BOCF imputation. These results will be compared to the 
week [ADDRESS_54781] computed by [CONTACT_51865] (Primary sensitivity analysis #2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary sensitivity analysis #5:  
The primary analysis will be repeated using the mean FEV 1 measurement from screening 
(Vis
it 0) and baseline (instead of the baseline FEV 1 measurement) in order to determine if the 
prim a
ry results are sensitive to any observed changes between screening and baseline in 
FEV 1.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Pri
mary sensitivity analysis #6 
Two responder analyses will be undertaken: 
1. A responder will be defined as those who have an increase from baseline FEV 1 of 
grea
ter than 100 mL (subjects who discontinued from the trial will be classified as 
non-responders). 
2. A non-responder will be defined as those who have a reduction from baseline FEV 1 of 
more 
than 100 mL (subjects who discontinued from the trial will be classified as non-
responders). 
Proportions in each treatment group will be assessed for each definition and compared 
between treatment groups using logistic regression. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary sensitivity analysis #7 
In addition to the responder analysis described above, a responder analysis will be undertaken 
where the cut-off for classification as a responder will be change from baseline FEV 1 greater 
than:  
-300, -250, -200, -150, -100, -50, 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 & 300mL respectively. 
These results will be plotted in a graphical summary for both treatment groups. These results 
can be scrutinized to ensure a consistent trend of treatment effect that is insensitive to any 
particular definition of response. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary sensitivity analysis #[ADDRESS_54782] of patterns of “missingness” in the data, multiple imputation (MI) with 
penalties will be used. Missing data across the treatment period, namely week [ADDRESS_54783] imputed by [CONTACT_51866] (i.e. multiple times). Then the impact of various penalties will be 
explored including linking penalties to reason for “missingness” and increasing penalties for 
subjects with multiple missing data (as these subjects could be less likely benefit from the 
treatment). The imputed longitudinal data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_51867]-effect model repeated 
measures (MMRM) model as above. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary sensitivity analysis #[ADDRESS_54784] (WOCF) + IUDR method rather than the BOCF + 
IUDR framework. 
10.2.[ADDRESS_54785] of taking mannitol  a per protocol analysis 
is planned. This entails re-fitting the primary efficacy model to the per-protocol analysis set. 
The results of this per protocol analysis will provide an extra robustness check on the main 
results from the ITT population. 
10.2.7 Secondary analyses  
Three key secondary objectives are ordered as follows and will be subjected to a hierarchical 
testing procedure outlined in Section 10.2.8 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hierarchical secondary objectives 
Objective #1: To determine whether inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is superior to control 
for improving lung function as measured by [CONTACT_51829] (mL) over the 
26-week treatment period in adult subjects with CF. 
 
DPM-CF-303 Protocol v2.0 13th October 2014 
Page
 59 of 72  Confidential  
 Analy
sis: The absolute change in FVC will be analyzed as per the primary analysis (i.e. 
REML based repeated measures approach using a model including the fixed, categorical 
effects of treatment, rhDNase use, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well 
as, the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline percent predicted FEV 1). 
Obje c
tive #2: To determine whether inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) is superior to control in 
increasing the time to first pulmonary exacerbation over the 26-week treatment period in 
adult subjects with CF. 
Analysis: The time (in days) from the date of first treatment to the date of the first pulmonary 
exacerbation (any grade) will be analyzed using the Cox’s Proportional Hazards model with 
time to first exacerbation as the outcome, and treatment, country, rhDNase use and historical 
exacerbation rate as factors.  The hazard ratio will be presented with 95% confidence limits.  
When a subject does not have an exacerbation during the trial period the subject will be 
censored at the date of their last participation in the trial. 
Objective #3: To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol (400 mg 
b.i.d.) is superior to control for reducing the number of days on antibiotics (oral, inhaled or 
IV) due to pulmonary exacerbation. 
Analysis: The number of days on antibiotics will be compared between treatment groups 
using a negative binomial model with the number of days on antibiotics recorded by [CONTACT_51868], and treatment group, country, rhDNase 
use and historical exacerbation rate as predictors.  An offset variable of the natural log of 
number of days in the trial will be used in the model to adjust for different lengths of follow-
up.  The rate ratio will be presented with 95% confidence limits. 
Objective #4: To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol (400 mg 
b.i.d.) is superior to control for decreasing the number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51771]. 
Analysis: The number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (admissions only) due to pulmonary exacerbation 
will be compared between treatment groups using a negative binomial model with the 
number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51815], and treatment group, country, rhDNase use and 
historical exacerbation rate as predictors.  An offset variable of the natural log of number of 
days in the trial will be used in the model to adjust for different lengths of follow-up.  The 
rate ratio will be presented with 95% confidence limits. 
Objective #5: To determine whether inhaled mannitol (400 mg b.i.d.) decreases the rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations over the 26-week treatment period compared to control in adult 
subjects with CF. 
Analysis: The rate of pulmonary exacerbations will be compared between treatment groups 
using a negative binomial model with the number of pulmonary exacerbations experienced by 
[CONTACT_51869], and treatment group, country 
and rhDNase use as predictors.  Historical exacerbation rate will be used as a covariate.  An 
offset variable of the natural log of number of days in the trial will be used in the model to 
adjust for different lengths of follow-up.  The rate ratio will be presented with 95% 
confidence limits. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-hierarchical secondary objectives 
Objective #1:  To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol (400 mg 
b.i.d.) is superior to control for decreasing incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. 
Logistic regression will be used to estimate the treatment effect (odds ratio) on the proportion 
 
DPM-CF-303 Protocol v2.0 13th October 2014 
Page
 60 of 72  Confidential  
 of subje
cts with one or more exacerbations. Covariates of country, rhDNase use and 
historical exacerbation rate will be included in the logistic regression model. 
Objective #2: To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol (400 mg 
b.i.d.) is superior to control for improving ease of expectoration. 
Analysis: The change in VAS score from baseline will be analyzed in a similar manner to the 
primary endpoint.  The mean absolute change from baseline VAS score over weeks 6, 14 and 
26 will be compared between the two treatment groups with a REML based repeated 
measures approach. Analyses will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, rhDNase 
use, country, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed 
covariates of baseline VAS score and baseline % predicted FEV 1. An unstructured 
(co)va
riance structure will be used to model the within-subject errors. 
Objective #3: To determine whether in adult subjects with CF, inhaled mannitol (400 mg 
b.i.d.) is superior to control for improving respi[INVESTIGATOR_51816]-R 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1798]. 
Analysis: Component questions in the questionnaire will be appropriately transformed 
according to the scoring manual, so that the best response will be uniformly the highest score 
and the worst response will be uniformly the lowest score.  The mean absolute change from 
baseline in the CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_51817] 6, 14 and 26 will be compared 
between the two treatment groups with a REML based repeated measures approach. Analyses 
will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, rhDNase use, country, visit, and 
treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline CFQ-R 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_51818] % predicted FEV 1. An unstructured (co)variance 
struc
ture will be used to model the within-subject errors. 
The CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_51819] “Have you had to cough up mucus?” 
The scoring algorithm scores an affirmative answer to this question as a negative outcome for 
the subject, however, due to the mechanism of action of mannitol (i.e. inducing coughing up 
mucus) an affirmative answer here may not be a negative outcome and hence this question is 
inappropriate here. Therefore, the above analyses will be repeated on the CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_51820].  
10.2.8 Hierarchical testing of key secondary objectives 
The hypotheses for the primary efficacy endpoint and the three key secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be formally tested utilizing a hierarchical testing approach to preserve the 
type-I error rate. Objectives will be tested in the order in which they are ranked in Section 2. 
10.2.9  Secondary analyses – missing data 
Change from baseline FVC:  
Missing post-baseline measurements will be handled as per the primary efficacy endpoint 
(FEV 1). 
Time
 to first pulmonary exacerbation: 
Subjects who withdraw from the trial prior to experiencing an exacerbation will be censored 
at the date of the last participation in the trial.  
Pulmonary exacerbation rate:  
In the event a subject discontinues from the trial before week [ADDRESS_54786]’s historical (previous 12 months) pulmonary exacerbation count (rounded 
upwards) and their treatment exposure time will be imputed as [ADDRESS_54787]’s historical (previous 12 months) pulmonary exacerbation count (rounded 
upwards) and their treatment exposure time will be imputed as 26 weeks. 
Number of days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51821]: 
Primary negative binominal analysis allows for different lengths of follow-up via offset 
variable. No further allowance for missing data will be made in these analyses. 
Pulmonary exacerbation incidence: 
No allowance for missing data will be made in this analysis.  
Ease of expectoration: 
Missing post-baseline measurements will be handled as per the primary efficacy endpoint 
(FEV 1). 
CFQ -
R respi[INVESTIGATOR_51774]: 
Missing post-baseline measurements will be handled as per the primary efficacy endpoint 
(FEV 1).  
10.2.10 Key se
condary sensitivity analyses 
Change in absolute FVC from baseline:  
* Analysis will be repeated without imputation of missing data. 
Pulmonary exacerbation rate:  
* Analysis will be repeated without imputation of missing data. 
* A zero inflated negative binomial model will be fitted and compared to the specified 
negative binomial model. 
10.2.11 Subgroup analyses 
Limited subgroup analyses of relevant primary and secondary will be performed to assess 
consistency of response between those: 
• with and without rhDNase use; 
• with and without Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection; 
• with differing baseline percentage of predicted FEV 1. 
11 ETHICAL ASPECTS 
The 
trial will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harm

responsible, appropriately trained, and credentialed professional(s) designated by [CONTACT_51875] a sub-Investigator.  
In the event of a significant protocol deviation due to an emergency, accident, or error, the 
Investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_51876]. This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to whether or not the subject 
should continue in the trial. The Investigator, the Sponsor, and the Medical Monitor will 
document this decision. 
[ADDRESS_54793] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
13.1 Source data 
The 
Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories (i.e., 
medic
al records) designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the trial for 
each trial subject.  The medical records must contain adequate information to allow for 
verification of subject identity throughout the trial.  
Any data recorded directly on the CRF, as agreed to by [CONTACT_51877]’s medical record, will be 
considered source data (e.g., results of physical examinations, vital signs testing, or the drug 
administration procedure).  The agreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor, 
including the type of parameters allowed to be entered directly on the CRFs, must be 
documented in the subject’s source documentation. 
The CRF and the subject’s medical records pertinent to the trial will be reviewed by [CONTACT_51878]’ designated Monitor, auditors and possibly by [CONTACT_51879]/IEC 
and regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_19124]. 
The Investigator is required to retain a subject identification code list to allow unambiguous 
identification of each subject included in the trial. This list should contain the subject’s full 
name, date of birth, dates of participation and identification number as per country 
regulations. The Investigator must agree to supply all details to the Sponsor auditor(s) and/or 
regulatory authorities, ensuring the data are held confidentially at the Investigator’s center 
after completion of the trial. A note will be made in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20114], if 
appropriate, that the subject is participating in a clinical trial. 
13.2 Case report form (CRF) 
In 
this trial, the CRF will be an electronic CRF (eCRF). The Investigator or the designated 
site
 person must complete the CRF and supporting documentation for each subject within a 
timely manner of the visit occurring.

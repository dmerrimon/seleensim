Objectives  Metformin is a safe, well -tolerated AMPK activator that has 
demonstrated efficacy in preclinical animal models of migraine and 
chronic pain. The objective of the MPEM Study is to determine if 
metformin will reduce the number of migraine days per month in 
patients with high -frequency migraine.

indicated in about 40% of individuals with migraines. Although [ADDRESS_335684] significant adverse-event profiles. As a result, less than 1/3 of migraine sufferers with who 
are candidates for prevention receive drug treatment and of those who are treated, more than 
85% have discontinued the preventive drug within one year.   . Medications designed to prevent 
migraine by [CONTACT_274925][INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 
Migraine pain is associated with the activation and sensitization of peripheral meningeal 
nociceptors. As a result, approximately 75% of patients with migraine will have cephalic 
allodynia during an attack. mTORC1/MAPK are involved with the sensitization of nociceptors, 
resulting in chronic pain (Price, 2012). AMPK is a negative modulator of the mTORC1/MAPK 
pathways (Price, 2012) and therefore may be a novel target for the preventive treatment of 
migraine.  
 
Metformin is a widely available, safe drug used to treat diabetes mellitus; it also is a powerful 
activator of AMPK. Preclinical data demonstrates efficacy of metformin in animal models of 
migraine, suggesting that it blocks hyperalgesia and the transformation to chronic pain.   
 
Metformin has been studied in oncologic research as a novel anticancer drug for many types of 
cancers including prostate, breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. Many studies of metformin 
in nondiabetic patients with cancer have shown tolerability and lack of hypoglycemia at 
therapeutic doses up to 1,500 mg daily (Dilokthornsakul, 2013; Laskov, 2014).

Micromedex and prior studies as documented in the protocol, metformin alone does not cause 
hypoglycemia. 
 
 Micromedex:  
             Hypoglycemia has not been reported at usual doses in monotherapy. Hypoglycemia may occur if 
             caloric intake is insufficient, if strenuous exercise occurs without adequate intake of calories, if 
             other glucose lowering agents are used concurrently, or in combination with ethanol use. 
 
We will instruct patients regarding eating well and not using any other glucose lowering agents or drink 
ethanol during the study. 
 
1.2 W e will educate patients on the symptoms of hypoglycemia including sweating, weakness, 
tachycardia, tremor, and feelings of nervousness and/or hunger. If they experience these 
symptoms, the patient can take 4 oz (120 mL) fruit juice; 6 ounces of non-diet soda; or a 
tablespoon (15 mL) of honey or table sugar. This process may be repeated in 10 to 15 minutes. If 
there is no improvement, they will be advised to seek immediate medical help. Investigational

Metformin is a widely available, safe drug used to treat diabetes mellitus; it also is a powerful 
activator of AMPK. Preclinical data demonstrates efficacy of metformin in animal models of 
migraine, suggesting that it blocks hyperalgesia and the transformation to chronic pain.   
 
Metformin has been studied in oncologic research as a novel anticancer drug for many types of 
cancers including prostate, breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. Many studies of metformin 
in nondiabetic patients with cancer have shown tolerability and lack of hypoglycemia at

1.[ADDRESS_335685] shown that 
application of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) to the dura of rats produces 
allodynia that lasts for 24 hours and is resolved by 48 hours (Figure 1) (Yan, 2012). However, 
they remain sensitive to normally nonnoxious stimuli such as small changes in pH (here, the 
application of a pH 6.8 solution to the dura). As shown in Figure 1, only rats that received IL-6 
responded to subsequent pH 6.8 stimulation, even though they were all free from allodynia. This 
shows that an initial headache-like event in rats can prime the nociceptive system to subsequent, 
MPEM Study   Version 4.0 
  Revised 01/12/2017 
normally subthreshold events. Mechanisms that mediate priming of the dural-afferent 
nociceptive system in rats may similarly sensitize the analogous system in humans and 
contribute to the pain of migraine. This could promote development of headaches in response to 
events that would be considered nonnoxious in those without headaches. Next, rats were given 
metformin (200 mg/kg, saline vehicle, administered intraperitoneally) the day before and the day 
of the IL-6 injection. Metformin administration attenuated the initial allodynia due to IL-6, but 
more importantly, it prevented development of the primed state (Figure 2). Rats treated with 
metformin did not have allodynia with pH 6.[ADDRESS_335686] clinical data exploring the use of metformin in high-frequency migraine.

2 S tudy Objectives 
Study Objective 1: To compare the reduction in the number of migraine days per month during 
12 weeks of treatment with metformin vs placebo (primary end point). 
 
Hypothesis: Metformin treatment will significantly reduce the number of migraine days per 
month compared with placebo. 
MPEM Study   Version 4.0 
  Revised 01/12/2017 
 
Study Objective 2: To compare the response rate (percentage of patients with a >50% reduction 
in migraine days per month) during 12 weeks of treatment with metformin vs placebo (secondary 
e
nd point). 
 
Hypothesis: The response rate to metformin will be significantly greater than the response rate to 
placebo. 
 
Study Objective 3: To determine the safety and tolerability of metformin in patients with 
migraine.  
 
Hypothesis: Metformin treatment will be safe and well tolerated, with limited adverse effects.  
 
[ADDRESS_335687], and all patients will  
provide written, informed consent before study enrollment.  
 
This will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study.  
 
After study enrollment,  patients will be randomized to the Metformin study drug group or the 
placebo group.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_274918]’t choose the study group. The pat ient  
will have an equal chance of being assigned to the Metformin group. Neither the patient or the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_274919].  In case of an 
emergency, this information will be available.   
 
 Patients will undergo a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test to confirm the absence of diabetes 
melli
tus. Subjects will then keep a paper headache diary for 4 weeks to establish baseline 
characteristics, including number of migraine days per month, number of moderate to severe 
headache days per month, and number of days per month of acute medication use. The 4-week 
baseline period will be followed by 2 treatment periods of 12 weeks each, separated by a 
MPEM Study   Version 4.0 
  Revised 01/12/2017 
washout period of 4 weeks (total study duration, 32 weeks).  During the washout period, we will 
washout the study drug x [ADDRESS_335688] headache characteristics, associated features, and medications 
used.

The Mayo Clinic Pharmacy will allocate patients to the metformin -placebo sequence or the 
placebo- metformin sequence in a 1:[ADDRESS_335702] to confirm the 
absence of diabetes mellitus. Subjects will then keep a headache diary for 4 weeks to establish 
baseline characteristics, including number of migraine days per month, number of moderate to 
severe headache days per month, and number of days per month of acute medication use. The 4-
week baseline period will be followed by 2 treatment periods of 12 weeks each, separated by a 
washout period of 4 weeks (total study duration, 32 weeks). For the 12-week treatment periods, 
subjects will receive either metformin 500mg twice daily or matching placebo twice daily. 
MPEM Study   Version 4.0 
  Revised 01/12/[ADDRESS_335703] been used successfully in migraine trials (Olesen, 1981). Prior migraine 
trials have suggested that a sample size of 34 patients has 80% power to detect a mean reduction 
in migraine days of 1.25 days per month, with =0.05[Q1] (σ 2.5, ρ 0.5; Hauge, 2009; 
Silberstein, 2004; Sorensen, 1986). We will enroll 40 subjects to account for an estimated 15% 
dropout rate.  
 
7.2 S tatistical Methods 
The primary end point is the number of migraine days per month during treatment with 
metformin vs placebo. The secondary end point is the percentage of patients with >50% 
reduction in migraine days per month (response rate). Mean 4-week migraine frequency for 
pa
tients receiving metformin vs placebo treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_274926]-Armitage 
method. Response rate will be assessed by [CONTACT_274927]. The frequency of adverse 
e

8 S afety and Adverse Events 
8.1 De finitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) 
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
 Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
br
each of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. 
MPEM Study   Version 4.0 
  Revised 01/12/[ADDRESS_335705] labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_274921], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromise the research data, AND  
 Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
"unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND 
 Related: A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures. 
 
Adverse Event 
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject. 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
de
fined and include; 
 de ath 
 li fe threatening adverse experience 
 hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 inpatient, ne w, or prolonged; disability/incapacity 
 pe rsistent or significant birth defect/anomaly 
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021]-investigator 
may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromised the research data. 
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as n on-
serious adverse events .  
 
MPEM Study   Version 4.0 
  Revised 01/12/2017 
Adverse Event Reporting Period 
For this study, the study treatment follow-up period is defined as 32 weeks following the 
ini
tiation of study treatmen t.  
 
Pr
eexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse 
event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last 
sc
heduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the investigator, any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
 
Abn
ormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if active 
mana
gement necessary requiring a change of dosage, or dosing schedule, discontinuation of 
study treatment or additional follow-up.

nostic, laboratory or procedure results should recorded in the source document. 
 
All adve
rse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse 
e
vents that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the 
fina
l outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to 
be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and

8.3.1 In vestigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB 
The investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68258]-UPI[INVESTIGATOR_274922]. 
 
According to Mayo IRB Policy any serious adverse event (SAE) which the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_205274] a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_274923] [ADDRESS_335708] learns of the problem/event. 
 
Adve
rse events will be reported in an adverse event worksheet to be entered in the research 
database:  
 S ubject’s name:  
 Medic al record number:  
 Disea se/histology (if applicable):  
 The  date the adverse event occurred:  
 Description of the adverse event:  
 R elationship of the adverse event to the research (drug, procedure, or intervention):  
 I f the adverse event was expected:  
 The  severity of the adverse event: (use a table to define severity scale 1-5) 
 I f any intervention was necessary:  
 R esolution: (was the incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment) 
 Da te of Resolution:  
 
The investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports need to be 
made
 to the IRB and FDA.  The investigator will sign and date the adverse event report when it 
is reviewed.  For this protocol, only directly related SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_274924]

8.4 Unm asking/Unblinding Procedures 
If unmasking/unblinding of the study drug is needed for subject safety, this will be performed. 
The study coordinator and the investigational pharmacy will determine if the subject was using 
MPEM Study   Version 4.0 
  Revised 01/12/[ADDRESS_335709] cases, the 
unmasking/unblinding will be part of managing an SAE, and will be reported with the SAE.  
However, in cases where unmasking/unblinding was not associated with an SAE, such actions 
should be reported in a timely manner.   
 
8.5 M edical Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-
monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, Auditi ng, and Inspecting ”).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events. 
 
[ADDRESS_335710] of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

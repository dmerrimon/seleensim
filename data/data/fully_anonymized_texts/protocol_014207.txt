BMT CTN PROTOCOL 1506 / ASTELLAS PROTOCOL 2215 -CL-0304  
A Multi -center, Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Phase III Trial of the 
FLT3 Inhibitor Gilteritinib Administered as Maintenance Therapy Following 
Allogeneic Transplant for Patients with FLT3/ITD AML  
 
Study Chairpersons:  Yi-Bin Chen, Mark Levis  
 
Study Design:   This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, multi -center 
Phase III trial which participants with FMS -like tyrosine kinase 3 
(FLT3) / internal tandem duplication (ITD) (FLT3/ITD) acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) in first morphologic complete remission 
(CR1) undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and 
are randomized to receive gilteritinib or placebo beginning after the 
time of engraftment for a two -year period.  Participants will be 
stratified according to 3  factors: 1)  conditioning regimen intensity 
(myeloablative vs reduced intensity/non -myeloablative), 2) time 
from first day of hematopoietic cell infusion to randomization 
(30-60 days vs 61 -90 days) and 3) presence vs absence of or 
unknown minimal residual disease (MRD ) from a pre -registration 
bone marrow (BM) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].   
 
Primary Objective : The primary objective is to compare relapse -free survival (RFS) 
between participants with FLT3/ITD AML in CR1 who undergo 
HCT and are randomized to receive gilteritinib or placebo 
beginning after the time of engraftment for a two -year period.   
 
Secondary Objectives:  
The key secondary objective is : 
1. To compare overall survival (OS) in participants  treated with 
gilteritinib as maintenance therapy after HCT compared to 
those treated wit h placebo.  
Additional secondary objectives include:  
2. To determine the safety and tolerability of gilteritinib after 
HCT.    
3. To compare non -relapse mortality (NRM) and event -free 
survival (EFS) (where events include relapse, death, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_886444] (DLI) 
or new therapy for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_103950]) in participants treated 
with gilteritinib as maintenance therapy after HCT compared to 
those treated with placebo.  
4. To compare [ADDRESS_1240432] disease (GVHD) and 12 -month 
and 24 -month cumulative incidence of mild, moderate, and 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240433] 
compared to those treated with placebo.  
 
Eligibility Criteria:  Participant s who are legal adults by [CONTACT_886496] a 
diagnosis of AML harboring a FLT3/ITD mutation. Participants 
must be in CR1 prior to transplant, as defined by < 5% blasts in the 
BM with no morphologic characteristics of acute leukemia (e.g., 
Auer rods) in  the BM with no evidence of extra -medullary 
leukemia. Participants must begin preparative chemotherapy for 
allogeneic transplant as consolidation therapy within [ADDRESS_1240434] achieve engraftment, defined as 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥  500 cells/µL and non -transfused 
platelet count ≥  [ZIP_CODE]/µL.  Participants must be registered for the 
study prior to the start of conditioning for the transplant.  
Participants will be allowed to receive any conditioning regimen, 
any GVHD prophylaxis regimen, and HCT from any graft - or 
donor -source. Registered participants who are not randomized will 
be replaced.  
 
Treatment Description:  A BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy will be obtaine d after engraftment is 
achieved, but prior to initiation of the study drug, to confirm an 
ongoing leukemia -free state. Between days +30 and +90 after the 
start day of transplant (day 0), participants will be randomized and 
initiate study drug, gilteritinib  120 mg orally per day or placebo 
(target initiation time is between days [ADDRESS_1240435]).  Study 
drug treatment will continue for 24 months (730 days)  from the 
start of therapy.   
 
Accrual Objective:  This clinical trial will randomize 173 participants per arm 
(346 total participants).    
 
Study Duration:  The estimated accrual period is 24 months.  Participants will be 
treated and assessed for up to 24 months (730  days)  following the 
initiation of study drug.  The primary analysis will occur 2.[ADDRESS_1240436].  If RFS is not statistically significant or 
both RFS and OS are statistically significant at the primary 
analysis, the study, including follow -up, will be stopped.  If RFS is 
statistically significant but OS is not statistically significant at the 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240437] for 2.5 to 
5.5 years if the RFS is not statistically significant or if both the 
RFS and OS are statistically significant at the primary analysis; 
otherwise, study duration for an individual participant will last up 
to 5 to 8 years . 
 
Lab Correlates:  DNA will be prepared from pre - and post -transplant BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_886445] a next -generation sequencing 
(NGS) assay.  Where available, DNA from the participant’s 
diagnostic BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], or blood if aspi[INVESTIGATOR_182449], will be 
analyzed for FLT3/ITD mutant -to-wild type allelic ratio.  The same 
diagnostic specimen will be analyzed for AML -associated 
mutations using an NGS platform.

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1. Introduction  
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy that confers a 
generally poor prognosis.  Although it can occur in children, its peak incidence is during the 
seventh decade of life.  There are roughly [ZIP_CODE] new cases per year in the US,1 and it has a 
similar incidence in other developed countries, including Europe.  AML patients are now 
routinely stratified at diagnosis into different risk categories based on screening for recurrent 
genetic abnormalities which de fine unique subtypes of the disease.  Overall survival (OS) for 
AML patients has been increasing each decade, particularly for patients under age 60, 
presumably because of improvements in supportive care, tailoring therapy according to risk 
category, and a dvances in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) techniques.[ADDRESS_1240446] -transplant setting, especially for those with poor prognosis AML.  
Activating mutations of the FMS -like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor are one of the most 
common genetic lesions in AML, and are associated with an ove rall poor prognosis.[ADDRESS_1240447] common mutation, found in 23% of de novo AML, is a FLT3/internal tandem 
duplication (ITD), usually localized to the  juxtamembrane domain.  Point mutations in the 
kinase domain, typi[INVESTIGATOR_886446] 835, are found in 7% of cases and only rarely 
are both mutations seen concurrently at initial diagnosis.  Both mutations constitutively 
activate FLT3 and, in the c ase of ITD mutations, lead to aberrant downstream signaling.  
FLT3 mutations are believed to act as second, or cooperating hits in leukemogenesis,4,[ADDRESS_1240448] 
often occurring with NPM1 mutations and in the context of a diploid karyotype.  De novo 
AML at diagnosis is polyclonal, the relative allelic  burden of each mutation reflects the 
mixture of different sub -clones.5  Patients with FLT3/ITD AML who present with a high 
FLT3 mutant allelic bur den fare much more poorly than their counterparts with low or 
intermediate allelic ratios.6,7  FLT3/ITD AML patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_886447] 
a hypercellular bone marrow (BM), and they respond to conventional induction 
chemotherapy with remission rates similar to th ose seen in ot her subtypes.  However, they 
are much more likely to relapse and relapse quickly; the presence of a FLT3/ITD mutation at 
relapse is one of the worst prognostic features known.8,[ADDRESS_1240449] -remission therapy for reducing 
the risk of relapse in AML, and the preponderance of literature (as well as National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] guidelines) supports this approach for FLT3/ITD 
AML.  However, the literature also suggests that while allogeneic transplant reduces the risk 
of relapse in comparison to consolidation chemotherapy, it is less effective for FLT3/ITD 
AML than for other AML subtypes, that is, patients with a FLT3/ITD mutation a re more 
likely to relapse following allogeneic transplant than AML patients lacking a FLT3/ITD 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240450] tha t patients with FLT3/ITD AML tend to 
have a higher disease burden even in remission (with higher rates of minimal residual disease 
[MRD]).  Furthermore, there are recent data suggesting that for patients with a high FLT3 
mutant allelic burden, even allogen eic transplant confers little benefit.7 Therefore, the 
currently accepted paradigm of induction chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_886497].  
FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been studied extensively over the past several 
years.[ADDRESS_1240451] shown significant clinical activity as single 
agents.  Effective, sustained FLT3 inhibition induces clearance of periphera l blasts and 
terminal myeloid differentiation of marrow blasts in patients with relapsed or refractory 
FLT3/ITD AML.  Agents such as sorafenib, quizartinib, crenolanib, and gilteritinib can 
induce a complete remission (CR) or, more commonly, a CR with inco mplete count recovery, 
in up to half of relapsed patients, and several pi[INVESTIGATOR_886448].  Importantly, there is a growing body of literature suggesting that FLT3 
TKIs can confer clinical benefit in the post -transplant setting.12,[ADDRESS_1240452] -transplant

18 months by 13% compared  with standard of care alone.[ADDRESS_1240453] -transplant 
maintenance therapy with an FLT3 inhibitor for patients with FLT3 /ITD AML who have 
undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT ).  NCCN guidelines, as 
well as guidelines for AML care in Sweden, have also included the option of FLT3 inhibitor 
maintenance therapy for patients with FLT3 /ITD AML in remission post -transplant, with 
sorafenib as the recommendation . 
The observed benefits could result from two potential mechanisms.  The first is i nhibition of 
an essential kinase in residual AML cells present in the post -transplant BM.  While FLT3 
inhibition may simply lead to suppressed growth of these residual tumor cells, the FLT3 TKI 
may synergize with any graft -versus -leukemia (GVL) effect that  exists during the 
maintenance therapy.  This is the same mechanism believed to account for the benefit of 
BCR -ABL inhibitors used in the post -transplant setting for Ph+ acute lymphocytic leukemia 
(Ph+ ALL) or high risk chronic myeloid leukemia.19,[ADDRESS_1240454] disease (GVHD) is one 
of the major morbidities of allogeneic transplant, but its collateral effect, namely GVL, forms 
the basis for much of the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic transplant.21  GVHD/GVL is 
thought to be mediated by [CONTACT_48919] T -cells, counterbalanced by [CONTACT_30962] T -cells (Tregs), 
notably the subset characterized by [CONTACT_886498]4+/CD25+/FoxP3+.22  Treg 
homeostasis is directly controlled by [CONTACT_886499],23 which in turn are dependent 
on FLT3 ligand (FL, the cognate ligand for the FLT3 receptor) for proliferation.24  Increases 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240455] of expanding the Treg population,25 which is postulated to 
suppress GVHD.  Conversely, FLT3 inhibition would be expected to augment GVHD/GVL.  
While this theoretically could result in significant toxicity to the patient, thus far none of the 
clinical studies have reported worsening GVHD as a limitation of the maintenance therapy 
with FLT3 TKIs.  This includes the randomized placebo -controlled trial of sorafenib as post -
transplant maintenance therapy , in which Grade  ≥ 3 adverse events of acute and/or chronic 
GVHD and skin toxicity were report ed at a greater incidence in sorafenib -treated participants  
compared with placebo;[ADDRESS_1240456] effective consolidation therapy for 
patients with FLT3/ITD AML, but relapse after transplant remains a significant problem.  
FLT3 inhibitors have demonstrated clinical activity in  this disease, and their use in the post -
transplant setting appears to be safe and tolerable.  The underlying hypothesis of this clinical 
trial is that maintenance therapy with a potent FLT3 inhibitor after allogeneic transplant will 
lead to improved relap se-free survival (RFS) for participant s with FLT3/ITD AML.  This 
multi -center international clinical trial is designed to prove or disprove this hypothesis by 
[CONTACT_886500]3/ITD AML participant s who have completed an allogeneic transplant to 
maintenance therapy with a FLT3 TKI versus placebo, in double -blind fashion.  Of the FLT3 
TKIs in current clinical development, there are five that would be reasonable choices to study 
in this context: midostaurin,[ADDRESS_1240457] profiles, sorafenib (hand -foot syndrome and gastrointestinal 
toxicity) and both midostaurin and crenolanib (nausea requiring pre -medication) would be 
problematic in a placebo -contr olled trial.  Although it is extremely well -tolerated by [CONTACT_1962], 
quizartinib is associated with QT prolongation and myelosuppression, both of which could 
complicate the care of post -transplant patients.  Gilteritinib (ASP2215) causes minimal side 
effects , and neither widespread QT prolongation nor myelosuppression were noted in a trial 
enrolling more than [ADDRESS_1240458] candidate for this trial.  
1.2.  Gilte ritinib (ASP2215)  
1.2.1.  ASP2215  Mechanism of Action  
Gilteritinib (ASP2215) is a novel small molecule pyrazinecarboxamide derivative with 
inhibitory activity against FLT3.  It has inhibitory activity against the two most common 
FLT3 -activating mutations (ITD and kinase domain).  It is active against most resistance -
conferring point mutant forms of FLT3 that arise during therapy with type [ADDRESS_1240459] KIT.  
Among 79 tyrosine kinases tested, ASP2215 hemifumarate inhibited activities of FLT3, 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240460] 19, 2022  
1-4 NPM1 -ALK, LTK, ALK and AXL kinases at 1 and 5 nmol/L, and TRKA, ROS, RET and 
MER kinases at 5 nmol/L by [CONTACT_46431] 50%.  The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) 
values for FLT3, EML4 -ALK, and KIT kinases were 0.291, 1.2, and 229 nmol/L, 
respectively.  ASP2215 hemifumarate inhibited the cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing 
FLT3 -ITD, FLT3 -D835Y, and FLT3 -ITD-D835Y with I C50 values of 1.8, 1.6, and 2.1 
nmol/L, respectively.  ASP2215 hemifumarate inhibited the growth of MV4 -11 cells with an 
IC50 value of 0.92 nmol/L.  In MV4 -11 cells, treatment of ASP2215 hemifumarate at 0, 0.1, 
1, and 10 nmol/L resulted in FLT3 phosphoryla tion of 100%, 86%, 19%, and 7%, 
respectively.  ASP2215 hemifumarate induced significant growth inhibition of MV4 -11 
tumors and tumor regression in vivo.  Further, ASP2215 hemifumarate at 6 and 10 mg/kg per 
day induced complete tumor regression for 4 and 6 out of 6 mice, respectively.  Body weight 
of the mice treated with ASP2215 hemifumarate was not affected at any tested doses.  
1.2.2.  ASP2215 Pharmacokinetics  
The main enzyme involved in the metabolism of ASP2215 is estimated to be cytochrome 
P450 (CYP)3A4.  ASP22 15 has an induction potential of CYP enzyme activities (CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5) and mRNA levels (CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4).  However, these results should be interpreted with 
caution because these effects were not un iformly observed in all donor samples and the 
concentration -dependency of these effects could not be evaluated. ASP2215 has direct 
inhibitory effects on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, but not direct inhibitory effects on CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6. Aft er oral administration of [14C] ASP2215 
hemifumarate at 1 mg/kg to rats, the urinary and biliary excretion of radioactivity within 
48 hours was 8.6% and 29.3% of the dose, suggesting that the oral absorption was at least 
37.9%. A part of the biliary excret ion is assumed to undergo enterohepatic circulation. 
ASP2215 is a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P -gp), but not for breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP). ASP2215 has the potential of P -gp and BCRP inhibition.  In AML participant s 
treated in the 2215 -CL-0101 Phase 1/2 study, the mean half -life of ASP2215 was greater than 
48 hours.  
1.2.3.  ASP2215 Formulation  
Please refer to the current version of the ASP2215 Investigator’s Brochure for details on 
gilteritinib tablet formulation.  
1.2.4.  ASP2215 Clinical Experience  
Gilteri tinib is approved in more than [ADDRESS_1240461] 
relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML with a FLT3 mutation . 
In a global phase 3 clinical study (2215 -CL-0301), gilteritinib demonstrated improved OS, 
supported by [CONTACT_886501] -free survival (EFS), complete remission (CR), 
complete remission/complete remission with partial hematological recovery and transfusion 
dependencies, in participant s with FLT3 R/R AML.  Study 2215 -CL-0101, a global phase 1/2 
study, provid ed further support for efficacy, which included prolonged survival and deep 
molecular responses in this participant  population.   Gilteritinib monotherapy was well 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240462] 19, 2022  
1-5 tolerated and generated high composite complete remission (CRc)  and best overall response 
(i.e., CRc + partial remission [PR]) rates and promising survival results in participant s with 
FLT3 R/R AML.  
Please refer to the current version of the ASP2215 Investigator’s Brochure for more detailed 
information.  
1.2.5.  ASP2215 Dose Rationale  
Gilteritinib has been evaluated in relapsed and refractory AML participant s in the US 
(clinical study 2215 -CL-0101) and Japan (clinical study 2215 -CL-0102) at doses from 20 mg 
to 450  mg.  In the US study, the MTD was determined to be 300 mg and in the Japa n study, 
the MTD was determined to be 200 mg; however, 120 mg was selected as the recommended 
phase 2/3 dose based on comparable efficacy, effective inhibition of target and lower DLT 
rate.  This dose is being used in all ongoing phase 3 trials.   Please re fer to the current 
ASP2215 Investigator’s Brochure for more detailed information.  
1.3. Rationale  
This multi -center phase III clinical trial will evaluate the impact of maintenance therapy with 
the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib on the RFS of participants with FL T3/ITD AML who have 
successfully undergone allogeneic transplant.  A dose of 120 mg has been chosen on the basis 
of a monotherapy trial, which demonstrated complete FLT3 inhibition in FLT3/ITD AML 
participant s.29 A maintenance period of 2 years (24 months) has been chosen based on Center 
for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) data that indicate the 
vast majority of relapses oc cur by [CONTACT_886502]. Because it is placebo -
controlled and double -blinded, the results that emerge from this study will establish whether 
or not FLT3 inhibition in this setting can prevent relapse, and whether or not it has an impact 
on GV HD in these participants.  Additionally, the trial may establish the utility of monitoring 
MRD using a next -generation sequencing (NGS) platform.  A validated MRD assay would 
represent an important advance for the field, as it would allow for the design of  more 
efficient trials testing novel agents in the treatment of FLT3/ITD AML.

2. STUDY DESIGN  
2.1.  Study Overview  
The study is a two -arm, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, multi -center trial in 
which participants with FLT3/ITD AML in first morphologic CR (CR1) undergoing 
allogeneic HCT will be randomized to receive gilteritinib or placebo [ADDRESS_1240464] 
for a two -year period. Participants will be stratified according to: 1) conditioning regime n 
intensity (myeloablative vs reduced intensity/non -myeloablative), 2) time from first day of 
hematopoietic cell infusion to randomization (30 -60 days vs 61 -90 days) and 3) presence vs 
absence of or unknown MRD from the most recent pre -registration BM aspi [INVESTIGATOR_337].   
2.2.  Hypothesis and Specific Objectives  
2.2.1.  Hypothesis  
The underlying hypothesis of this clinical trial is that maintenance therapy with a FLT3

who have undergone allogeneic transplant and are in CR1 to one of two arms, in double -blind 
fashion: 1)  maintenance therapy with 120 mg per day of the FLT3 inhibitor, gilteritinib; or 2) 
placebo.

5HT 2BR or sigma nonspecific receptor with the exception of drugs that are considered by 
[CONTACT_886509] ( APPENDIX H ). 
C. Participant has a QTcF interval > 450 msec (average of triplicate determinations) by 
[CONTACT_175207].  
D. Participant has a need for supplemental oxygen with the exception of using previ ously 
existing non -invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night.  
E. Participant has used investigational agents within 4 weeks of randomization.  
F. Participant has used experimental therapy for aGVHD within 4 weeks of randomization. 
If unsure of the definition of “experimental”, discussion with the one of the protocol 
chairs is recommended.  
G. Participant has an uncontrolled infection.  If a bacterial or viral infection is present, the 
participant must be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs  of progressing 
infection for [ADDRESS_1240476] no signs of 
progressing infection for 1 week prior to randomization.  
● Progres sing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis 
or new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable 
to infection.    
● Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as 
progress ing infection.  
Waivers to the exclusion criteria will NOT be allowed.   
2.3.3.  Inclusion of Women, Minorities and Other Underrepresented Populations  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above should have no effect on the enrollment of 
these traditionally underrepresented groups in clinical studies.  Accrual of women and 
minorities will be monitored to determine whether rates of enrollment are reflective of the 
distribution of potentially eligible women and minorities in the population served.  
2.4.  Treatment Pl an 
Randomization should occur anytime between days 30 to 90 after day zero (the day of 
allograft infusion) of HCT.  BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy after engraftment after HCT must be 
done to confirm ongoing remission and must be performed ≤ [ADDRESS_1240477] , but the protocol allows randomization up to day +[ADDRESS_1240478].  Study 
drug should be started within 24 hours of randomization. Day 1 of the t reatment period is 
defined as the date of randomization.   Study drug will be administered on an outpatient basis 
but may be continued in the inpatient setting if participants require inpatient evaluation. 
Expected toxicities and potential risks as well as dose modifications for gilteritinib are 
described in Sections 2.7 and 2.8 (Dose Modifications and Participant Risks).  No 
investigational or commercial agents or the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_886453]’s malignancy.  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240479] 2 hours after or 1 hour before consuming food.  Study drug  will be 
self-administer ed at home when participants are not scheduled for clinic visits. If participant 
is scheduled for a clinic visit, they will take their medication after the pharmacokinetic blood 
draw.  If a participant forgets to take a dose in the morning (or their pharmacokinetic  blood 
draw is on that day) and it is within 6 hours of the planned dosing time, he/she will be 
instructed to take his/her dose. If the participant forgets to take the daily dose (or their 
pharmacokinetic  blood draw is on that day) and more than 6 hours has passed the planned 
dosing time, he/she will be instructed to wait for the next morning to dose.  If vomiting 
occurs after dosing, the participant should not receive another dose, but should wait until the 
next morning to dose.  Missed or vomited doses will not be replaced. (Refer to Section 2.7 
for infor mation on dose modifications).  
2.4.2.  Duration of Therapy  
Gilteritinib or placebo therapy will continue for a maximum of 24 months  (730 days)  from 
randomization or until one of the following criteria applies:  
● Disease relapse  
● Unacceptable  adverse event (AE)(s),  
● Parti cipant  decides to withdraw from treatment  
● Participant  does not follow instructions  
● General  or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant  
unacceptable for further treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021] . 
● Participant  begins other anti -leukemic therapy.  
If the participant discontinues treatment early, then the reason for treatment discontinuation 
and the date the participant was removed must be documented in the study -specific  case 
report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  
Participants removed from treatment for unacceptable AEs will be followed until resolution 
or stabilization of the AE.  
Participants that discontinue treatment early will continue to be followed for relapse,  if not 
yet documented, and survival.

2.4.3.  Duration of Follow -Up  
Participants will return to the clinic for study visits while on study drug for up to  24 months 
(730 days)  following the initiation of study drug . The primary analysis will occur 2.[ADDRESS_1240482] for 2.5 to 5 .5 years if the RFS is not 
statistically significant or if both the RFS and OS are statistically significant at the primary 
analysis; otherwise, study duration for an individual participant  will last up to 5 to 8 years .  
2.4.4.  Criteria for Removal from Study  
Participants will be withdrawn from study drug when any of the criteria listed in Section  2.4.2  
applies. Participants who complete 24 m onths (730 days) of study drug and those who 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240483] 19, 2022  
2-10 discontinue study drug early will continue to be followed for survival and other outcomes 
until one of the following criteria is met:  
● Participant decides to withdraw consent for further follow -up on survival and  other 
outcomes.  
● Participant is lost to follow -up despi[INVESTIGATOR_330995].  
● [ADDRESS_1240484] participant randomized.  
● Death.  
The reason for study removal and the date the participant was removed must be documented 
in the study -specific  CRF.  
2.5. Graft -versus -host Disease (GVHD) during Therapy  
If a participant develops new onset GVHD, or experiences an increase in the severity of 
pre-existing GVHD requiring an escalation of immunosuppressive medication, every effort 
should be made to continue the study drug without any dose reduction.   If the participant is 
unable to take oral medications as a result of GVHD, the study drug can be wi thheld until the 
participant is able to resume oral medications.  
2.5.1.  Management of Acute GVHD  
Acute GVHD should be managed per institutional guidelines.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_886456].  Discussion 
with one of the protocol chairs is recommended if uncertainty exists.  
2.5.2.  Management of Chronic GVHD  
Chronic GVHD should be managed per institutional guidelines. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_886457].  
Discussion with one of the protocol chairs is recommended  if uncertainty exists.  
2.6. General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
All medications and concomitant treatments administered from [ADDRESS_1240485] be recorded in the electronic case r eport form 
(eCRF).   
2.6.1.  Antimicrobials  
Antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis during and after allogeneic HCT are 
recommended and can be administered based on local institutional guidelines.  
2.6.2.  Tapering of GVHD Prophylaxis  
Institutional practice shou ld be followed for tapering immunosuppressive therapy in the 
absence of GVHD.  There are no formal recommendations given that participants receiving 
HCT from any type of donor, after any conditioning and receiving any GVHD prophylaxis 
regimen are eligible.  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240486] 19, 2022  
2-11 2.6.3.  Donor Lymphocyte Infusions  
Pre-emptive/prophylactic administration of donor lymphocytes for disease progression is not 
permitted in this protocol. DLI for infectious complications is allowed. DLI given for 
modulation of T cell chimerism in the peri -transp lant or the post -transplant period per 
institutional protocol is allowed.  
2.6.4.  Prohibited Therapy  
Concomitant use of other anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], other anti -AML maintenance, or 
investigational agents is not permitted while participants are receiving study drug during the 
treatment phase of the study. Participation in another interventional study while on treatment 
is prohibited. Treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inducers of CYP3A within 
14 days of start of study drug are prohibited.  These are lis ted in Table  2 below:  
Table  2 Strong CYP3A Inducers  
Drug/Food/Supplement Type  Food, Supplement or Generic Drug Name  
[CONTACT_255165][INVESTIGATOR_23935], Anticonvulsant  Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Phenytoin  
Antibiotic  Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_886458]. John’s wort  
CYP: cytochrome P450  
2.6.5.  Other Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Non -medication Therapy)  
Treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of P-gp and 
concomitant drugs that target serotonin 5HT 1R or 5HT 2BR or sigma nonspecific receptor 
should be avoided with the exception of drugs that are considered absolutely essential for the 
care of the participant. Treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inhibitors of 
CYP3A should be avoided with the exception of antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals that 
are used as standard of care to prevent or treat infections. Grapefruit juice should not be 
ingested during study treatment. If strong CYP3A  inhibitors are used concomitantly, 
participants should be closely monitored for AEs.  
Precaution should be used in use of gilteritinib with concomitant drugs that are known to 
prolong QT or QTc intervals.  
Precaution should be used in use of gilteritinib with concomitant drugs that are substrates of 
BCRP, since the transporter has been shown to be inhibited by [CONTACT_886510].   
Common strong CYP3A inhibitors, strong CYP3A inducers, drugs ta rgeting the serotonin 
receptor, P -gp inhibitors or inducers, and drugs known to prolong QT or QTc intervals are 
listed in APPENDIX H . The investigator should consult individual labels for all drugs that 
the participant is taking to evaluate if they fall into any of the above named categories.  
Participants undergoing allogeneic transplantation are expected to be receiving treatment 
with a number of approved dru gs that are known to be CYP3A substrates and/or inhibitors.  
Because gilteritinib is also a CYP3A4 substrate, drug -drug interactions between the study 
drug and conventional agents (e.g., azoles) are anticipated.  Participating centers will adhere 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240487] 19, 2022  
2-12 to instit utional practice regarding the monitoring of serum levels of immunosuppressive 
agents such as tacrolimus or azoles.  Regardless of which concomitant medications are 
administered, there will be no dose modification of gilteritinib in the absence of drug -related 
toxicity.  
2.7. Dose Modifications  
All A Es occurring after randomization will be reported and graded according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. 
The study drug will be interrupted if a gr ade 3 or greater AE occurs and the local principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_886459], probably or definitely related to the study drug.  
When the grade of AE decreases to baseline or grade ≤ 1, the study drug may be resumed at 
the next lower dose level, unless the local investigator deems the AE was, in retrospect, 
unlikely to be or not related to the study drug, at which point the original dose may be 
resumed.  If an AE occurs that prevents administration of the study drug (e.g., surgery that 
precludes an oral drug, intubation for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]), and that AE is judged to be not 
caused by [CONTACT_5257], the study drug may be resumed at the original dose when deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_16533]. Guidelines for dose interruption , reduc tion and 
discontinuation  are provided in Table  3. 
Table  [ADDRESS_1240488] occurrence: Grade 3 or greater AE 
possibly or probably related to the 
study drug  The study drug will be interrupted until resolution of the AE to 
baseline or grade ≤ 1.  The participant may then resume with one 
dose level reduction (to 80 mg or if c urrently at 80  mg to 40 mg 
per day).  If participant is at 40  mg per day at the time of the event, 
then study drug will be discontinued.  Resumption at original dose 
level permitted as detailed in Section 2.7. 
Second occurrence: Recurrence of the 
same AE or appearance of a new AE 
grade 3 or greater probably or possibly 
due to the study drug  The study drug will be interrupted until resolution of the AE to 
baseline or grade ≤1.  The participant may resume treatment at 
[ADDRESS_1240489] occurrence: Recurrence of a prior 
AE or appearance of a new AE gr ade [ADDRESS_1240490], if the 
investigator determines a prior grade 3 
or greater AE which was initially 
attributed as possibly, or probably 
related to study drug is now deemed 
unrelated  The study drug will be re -escalated to the dose that the participant 
was on at the time of the AE.

2-13 Event  Action  
QTcF > 500 ms  If the mean triplicate QTcF is > 500 ms at any time point, the ECG 
will be repeated (within 2  hours if identified on machine read or as 
soon as possible if identified from central reading). Cardiology 
consult will be obtained as medically indicated. If the  repeat ECG 
confirms a mean of the triplicate QTcF > 500 ms, dosing of study 
treatment will be interrupted for up to 14 days. While study drug 
may be interrupted temporarily based on machine read, the central 
reading should be used for final treatment deci sions. If QTcF 
resolves to ≤ 480 ms by [CONTACT_559824] 14  days, the 
participant may resume dosing at the reduced dose of 80 mg (or if 
currently at 80  mg, reduction to 40 mg).  
QTcF day 8 increase >  30 ms If the mean triplicate QTcF on day 8 has inc reased >  30 ms 
compared to the mean triplicate QTcF of the pre -randomization 
ECG with no other known etiology, then a confirmatory ECG will 
be performed day 9. If the day 9 mean triplicate QTcF also shows 
an increase of >  30 ms compared to that of the pre -randomization 
ECG, then dose reduction by 1 dose level should be considered.

2.8.  Participant Risks  
2.8.1.  Therapy Toxicities  
Please refer to the current ASP2215 Investigators Brochure for details on therapy toxicities.  
2.9.  Study Drug Supply  
2.9.1.  Gilteritinib  
Gilteritinib is an oral drug that is available in a 40 mg tablet. In addition to the active 
ingredient, gilteritinib 40 mg tablet s contain well -characterized excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Gilteritinib tablets 
are round light -yellow film -coated tablets. Refer to the current ASP2215 Investigator’s 
Brochure for further details.   
2.9.2.  Placebo  
Placebo tablets are identical in size and appearance to gilteritin ib tablets and contain well -
characterized excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Refer to the current ASP2215 Investigator’s Brochure for further 
details.   
2.9.3.  Packaging and Labeling  
All study drug used in this study will be prepared, packaged, and labeled under the 
responsibility of qualified staff at Astellas Pharma Global Development (APGD) -Astellas US 
Technology (AUST) or Sponsor’s designee in accordance with APGD -AUST or Sponsor’s  
designee Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) 
guidelines, International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, and applicable local laws/regulations. Each bottle will bear a label conform ing to 
regulatory guidelines, GMP and local laws and regulations which identifies the contents as 
investigational drug.  Temperature logs must be maintained by [CONTACT_886511] (at minimum). Study centers will be provid ed bottles containing 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240492] 19, 2022  
2-14 blinded study drug (gilteritinib or placebo).  Refer to the current Pharmacy Manual for 
further details on storage.   
2.9.4.  Study Drug Handling  
Current ICH GCP Guidelines require the investigator to ensure that study drug deliveries 
from th e Sponsor are received by [CONTACT_093]/or designee and that:  
● all deliveries are recorded,  
● the study drug is handled and stored according to labeled storage conditions,  
● only study drug with appropriate expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061]/retest is dispensed to study participants in  
accordance with the protocol, and  
● all unused study drug is returned to the Sponsor or designee, or standard procedures for 
alternative disposition of unused study drug are followed.  
Study drug inventory and accountability records for the study drugs will be kept by [CONTACT_1275], or designee. Study drug accountability throughout the study must be 
documented and reconciled.  
The following guidelines are therefore pertinent:  
● The investigator agrees not to supply study drugs to any persons except the eligi ble 
participants in this study in accordance with the protocol.  
● The investigator or designee will keep the study drugs in a pharmacy or other locked and 
secure storage facility under controlled storage conditions, accessible only to those 
authorized by [CONTACT_886512].  
● A study drug inventory will be maintained by [CONTACT_1719]. The inventory 
will include details of material received and a clear record of when they were dispensed 
and to which participant.  
● At the conclusion or termination of this study, the investigator or designee agrees to 
conduct a final drug supply inventory and to record the results of this inventory on the drug 
accountability record. It must be possible to reconcile delivery records with thos e of used 
and/or returned study drug. Any discrepancies must be accounted for and documented. 
Appropriate forms of deliveries and returns must be signed by [CONTACT_106354].  
● The site must return study drug to the Sponsor or desi gnee (after reconciliation by [CONTACT_162071]) at the end of the study or upon expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. In rare cases, study drug may be 
destroyed at the study site only if agreed upon by [CONTACT_1034]. A copy of the standard 
institutional procedure for destroying inves tigational drugs will be provided to the sponsor 
or designee upon request.  
The following paragraph is specific to investigational sites in Japan:  
In Japan, the head of the study site or the study drug storage manager should take 
accountability of the stud y drugs as follows:  
● The study drug storage manager should store and take accountability of the study drugs in 
conforming to the procedures for handling the study drugs written by [CONTACT_1034].  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240493] 19, 2022  
2-15 ● The study drug storage manager should prepare and retain records  of the study drug ’s 
receipt, the inventory at the study site, the use by [CONTACT_886513].  These records should include 
dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable) and the unique 
code numbers assigned to the study drugs and participants . 
● The study drug storage manager should prepare and retain records that document 
adequately that the participants  were provided the doses specified by [CONTACT_559845].  
2.9.5.  Blinding  
This is a double -blind study. Participants will be randomized to receive gilteritinib or placebo 
in a double -blind fashion such that the investigator, Sponsor’s study management team, 
clinic al staff, nor the participant will know which agent is being administered. The 
randomization number will be assigned based on information obtained from the Interactive 
Response Technology (IRT) system and Advantage eClinicalSM. 
2.9.6.  Retention of the Assignment Schedule  
The randomization list and study medication blind will be maintained by [CONTACT_82550].  
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be provided access to the dosing assignment 
for periodic review of the unblinded data as documented in the DSMB Ch arter and the study -
specific DSMB Charter Addendum.  
2.9.7.  Breaking the Treatment Code by [CONTACT_886514] a suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R), in order to determine if the in dividual case or 
a group of cases requires expedited regulatory reporting. Individual Emergency Codes will be 
provided to the limited staff who are responsible for breaking the codes for all S[LOCATION_003]R cases 
for reporting purposes.  
The treatment code for each randomized participant will be provided by [CONTACT_886515]. The time, date, participant number and re ason for 
obtaining any of these codes, and therefore breaking the blind, must be documented in the 
study file. They must only be requested by [CONTACT_886516]-investigators. No participants or other study personnel will b e made aware of the 
treatment given to any participant unless a medical emergency necessitates such disclosure.  
Unblinding of the study drug should only be considered for participant safety and/or evidence 
of documented relapse  contingent upon knowing the blinded study drug assignment.  
● Unblinding  for participant  safety  by [CONTACT_179951] -investigator  must 
be reported immediately to the Sponsor  (Astellas Medical Monitor)  and must include an 
explanation of why the study medication was unblinded.   If possible, the Sponsor should 
be contact[CONTACT_886517].  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240494] 19, 2022  
2-16 ● Unblinding for documented relapse by [CONTACT_179951] -investigator  
must be re ported to the Sponsor  (Astellas Medical Monitor) , including an explanation 
and evidence of relapse prior to unblinding of the study drug.   The Astellas Medical 
Monitor must provide approval for individual participant unblinding for relapse prior to 
the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_886460].  
The study will be unblinded after database lock for the primary analysis.  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240495].  Morphological  relapse will 
be defined as BM  blasts 5% or higher (not attributable to regenerating BM), any 
circulating blasts (not attributable to regenerating BM or growth factors), or any 
extra -medullary blast foci as per Revised International Working Group (R -IWG) 
criteria.  Documentation to support relapse diagnosis must be submitted to the Blinded 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee. Relapse document ation will be dependent on the type of 
relapse and may include but is not limited to: bone marrow biopsy reports, flow cytometry 
reports, tissue biopsy reports, and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_886461].  
RFS (or leukemia -free survival; LFS) is the best pred ictor of both OS for AML patients who 
are in remission and/or have undergone allogeneic transplant.  A tight correlation between 
LFS and OS has been demonstrated to exist in AML patients treated with maintenance 
therapy,31 and a strong association between relapse after transplant and poor survival is 
well-established in the literature.32,33,34  RFS is particularly relevant for the participants in this 
study, as the presence of a FLT3/ITD mutation at relapse is one of the worst prognostic 
features in AML.   Greater than 80% of patients who relapse after allogeneic transplant do so 
within 2 years of transplant.34 Specifically, relapses among transplanted FLT3/ITD+ patients 
generally occur early in post -transplant course; from Eu ropean Society for Blood and 
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and CIBMTR data, their incidence after [ADDRESS_1240496] -
transplant FLT3/ITD+ AML relapse.  While available data show this approach to treat overt 
relapse has clinical activity and generally limited toxicity, the durability of both disease - and 
symptom -control is modest, which remains a concern.  Whether FLT3 inhibitor therapy of 
clinical relapse extends OS beyond that achieved with standard chemotherapy is to date 
unproven.  As well, rigorous quality of life comparisons among participants randomized to 
FLT3 inhibitors and traditional chemotherapy approaches have not yet been performed.   
Overall, it is expected that survival of participants who relapse after treatment on this 
protocol will be poor, regardless of whether they receive cytotoxic agents, FLT3 inhibitors, 
and/or cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_886462]. The vast majority of AML patients who relapse after 
transplant either die of their disease or die during attempts to re -achieve subsequent 
remissions. RFS therefore remains the single most important endpo int in a trial of 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240497]-transplant AML patients in remission, as it correlates with both prolongation of survival 
and with quality of life after transplant.  
3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
3.2.1.  Overall Survival (OS)  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is OS. Time to OS is defined as the time to death from 
any cause after randomization. For surviving participants, non -events will be censored at the 
last known alive date.  
3.2.2.  Safety and Tolerability of Gilteritinib after HCT  
All grade ≥ 3 toxicities according to CTCAE version 4. 03 will be tabulated for each 
treatment arm.  The proportion of participants developi[INVESTIGATOR_30462] ≥ 3 A Es across treatment 
arms will be compared.  In addition, the incidence of all grade 1 to 4 toxicities according to 
CTCAE version 4.03 will be tabulated for e ach treatment arm and compared. Clinical 
laboratory evaluations and change from baseline will be described and compared. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) results and change from baseline will be described and compared. 
Karnofsky Performance Status scores will be de scribed and compared. The duration of drug 
use and dose of drug use will also be compared.  
3.2.3.  Non-relapse Mortality  
An event for this endpoint is death without evidence of disease progression or recurrence.  
3.2.4.  Event -free Survival (EFS)  
The cumulative incidence at 12 months and 24 months after randomization of EFS will be 
described and compared.  Events for EFS are as defined in Section 2.4.2 . 
3.2.5.  Cumulative Incidence of Acute GVHD  
The cumulative incidence at 6 months after randomization of grades II -IV and grades III -IV 
aGVHD will be described and compared.  Acute GVHD will be graded according to diagnosis 
and severity scoring used by [CONTACT_886518] 
(BMT  CTN) ( APPENDIX I ).   
3.2.6.  Cumulative Incidence of Chronic GVHD  
The cumulative incidence at 12 months and 24 months after randomization of chronic GVHD 
will be described and compared. Chronic GVHD will be graded according to diagnosis and 
severity scoring from the NIH 2014 Consensus Criteria ( APPENDIX I ).    
3.2.7.  Detection of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)  
The cumulative incidence of detection of FLT3/ITD MRD in participants who are FLT3/ITD 
MRD undetectable prior to randomization will be described.  Similarly, the pattern of 
eradication of FLT3/ITD MRD in participants who have detectable FLT3/ITD MRD prior to 
randomization will be described.  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240498] 19, 2022  
3-3 3.2.8.  Incidence and Severity of Infection  
The cumulative incidence of CTCAE grades 3 to 5 infection in participants will be described 
and compared . 
3.3.  Exploratory Endpoints  
3.3.1.  Health -related Quality of Life  
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT -BMT) 
version 4.0 instrument is comprised of a general core questionnaire, the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General ( FACT -G), which evaluates the HQL of participants 
receiving treatment for cancer, and a transplant -specific module, bone marrow transplant 
(BMT) Concerns, that addresses disease and treatment -related questions specific to 
BMT .  The FACT -G consists of four subscales developed and normed in cancer 
participants:   Physical Well -being, Social/Family Well -being, Emotional Well -being, and 
Functional Well -being.   Each subscale is positively scored, with higher scores indicating 
better functioning.   The FACT -BMT Tot al, which is the grand total of all items in the 
FACT -G and BMT modules, will be used as the outcome measure in summarizing the 
FACT -BMT data.  
The FACT -Leu is a modular approach to assess patient HQL and leukemia -specific 
symptoms using a ‘core’ set of que stions (FACT -G), as well as a cancer site -specific 
leukemia subscale.36,[ADDRESS_1240499] -Leu. Only the leukemia -specific subscale consisting of 
17 items that assess patient concerns relating to leukemia (FACT -Leu) will be administered. 
Higher scores are reflective of better HQL. The FACT -Leu total score (score range: 0 -176; 
combining FACT -Leu with the FACT -G scores from the FACT -BMT) will be used in 
analysis.  
The EQ -5D-5L is a self -reported questionnaire. The EQ -5D-5L is being used as a measure of 
respondent ’s HQL. The EQ -5D-5L consists of the EuroQol Group -5 Dimension descriptive 
system and the EuroQol Group visual analogue scale (VAS).  The EuroQol Group -5 
Dimension descriptive system comprises of 5  dimensions of  health: mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.   Each dimension has 5 levels: no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.   The 
VAS records the respondent's self -rated health  status on a graduated (0 -100) scale, where the 
endpoints are labeled ‘best imaginable health state’ and ‘worst imaginable health state’ with 
higher scores for higher HQL.  
HQL will be described from pre -transplant to last follow -up at [ADDRESS_1240500] procedures.   The self -repor t 
questionnaires will be completed prior to transplant, prior to randomization, on day 29, and at 
months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 after randomization. Comparisons of quality of life will be done 
between maintenance arms at each of the time points after randomi zation.

Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240525] only be followed for relapse 
and survival according to the long -term follow -up instructions in Table  4. 
4.5. Data Reporting  
4.5.1.  Criteria for Forms  Submission  
Forms that are not entered into Advantage eClinical within the specified time will be 
considered delinquent.  A missing form will be requested either until the form is entered into 
the Advantage eClinical and integrated into the Data Coordinat ing Center’s (DCC) master 
database, or until an exception is granted and entered into the Missing Form Exception File.  
4.5.2.  Reporting Participant Death  
If a participant death occurs during the SAE collection period (see Section 4.6), information 
must  be entered into Advantage eClinical within 24 hours of knowledge of the participant’s 
death. If a participant death occurs during the long -term follow -up period, informatio n must  
be entered into Advantage eClinical according to the standard entry timelines. If the cause of 
death is unknown at that time, it does not need to be recorded at that time.  However, once 
the cause of death is determined, the form must be updated in Advantage eClinical.  
4.6. AE Reporting  
AE reporting requirements are summarized below and further information regarding A Es is 
described in APPENDIX K .  AEs and S AEs will be collected from the time of randomization 
through [ADDRESS_1240526] a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) pr oduct, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240527] 19, 2022  
4-17 GVHD and infection are collected on separate CRFs because they are separate endpoints. 
Events of GVHD and infection are not to be reported as A Es for this study unless  they meet 
one of the following:  
● Meet one o r more of the SAE criteria in Section 4.6.2  and be related to study drug  
● Result in death between the first dose of stud y medication through [ADDRESS_1240528] 
dose of study drug (inclusive), regardless of relationship to study drug.  
Some countries may have additional local requirements for reporting events as A Es or in an 
expedited manner similar to an SAE. In these ca ses, it is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure these A Es or other reporting requirements are followed and the information is 
appropriately reported via the web -based electronic data capture system, Advantage eClinical 
accordingly.  
An abnormality id entified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, physical exam) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets 1 of the 
following criteria:  
● Induces clinical signs or symptoms.  
● Requires active intervention.  
● Require s interruption or discontinuation of study medication.  
● The abnormality or investigational value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].  
See APPENDIX J  for detailed information on monitoring and assessment of liver 
abnormalities.  
4.6.2.  Definition of SAEs  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
● Death  
● Is life threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death.  
It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)  
● Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
● Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
● Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886473]/observation/examination caused by [CONTACT_610910])  
● Other medically important events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the participant or may require interven tion to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations. These events, including those that may result in 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240529] 19, 2022  
4-18 disability/incapacity,  should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886474] a buse.  
For this study, GVHD and infection are only to be reported as SAE s if one of the following 
conditions is met: 1) the event is both related to study drug and also meets the definition of 
SAEs above , or 2) the event results in death that occurs within [ADDRESS_1240530] dose of 
study drug.  
AML relapse will not be reported as an AE/SAE term unless it is the cause of a death that 
occurs between the first day of study drug though [ADDRESS_1240531] dose of study drug 
(inclusive).  
Special situations  related to the medicinal products administered to the participant as part of 
the study (e.g., study drug) that may require expedited reporting and/or safety evaluation 
include, but are not limited to:  
● Overdose of the medicinal product(s)  
● Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)  
● Occupational  exposure to the medicinal product(s)  
● Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without participant exposure 
to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])  
● Off-label use  
● Lack of effect  
● Exposure via breast  milk 
● (Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884]) transmission of an infectious agent  
● Drug -drug interaction  
All serious events and special situations noted above must be reported through the expedited 
AE reporting system via Advantage eClinical and must be  reported within [ADDRESS_1240532] be 
completed and emailed to [EMAIL_16859] to initiate Sponsor review. Once the 
system is available, the event information must be ent ered into the system.   
The Sponsor also has a list of events for gilteritinib classified as “ important medical  events ”. 
If an AE is considered to be an event per this classification as an “important medical event ”, 
additional information on the event may be requested and the event will be requested to be 
reported through the expedited AE reporting system via Advantage eClinical . In the event an

4.6.3.  Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug  
AEs that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "AE whose 
relationship to the study drugs could not be ruled out". Table  [ADDRESS_1240535] abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide 
plausible explanations.  
Possible  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the study drug, but which could also be explained 
by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on drug 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Probable  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the study drug, unlikely to b e attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically 
reasonable response on re -administration (re -challenge) or withdrawal (de -
challenge).  
 
4.6.4.  Criteria for Defining the Severity of an AE  
AEs, including abnormal clini cal laboratory values, will be graded using the CTCAE 
guidelines (version 4.03).  The items that are not stipulated in the CTCAE version 4.03 will 
be assessed according to the criteria below in Table  6 and entered into the web -based 
electronic data capture system, Advantage eClinical.  
  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240536]  
1-Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations noted; 
intervention not indicated  
2-Moderate  Local or noninvasive intervention indicated  
3-Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255130]  
4-Life Threatening  Life threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated  
5-Death  Death related to the AE  
4.6.5.  Criteria for Defining Expectedness  
For the purposes of regulatory reporting, e xpected SAEs are those that are listed in the 
Investigational Brochure.  
4.6.6.  AE Reporting Guidelines  
AEs must be reported regardless of whether a relationship exists between the AE and the use 
of the study drug.  
From the time of screening until randomization , only deaths should be reported during this 
time frame on the appropriate event -driven CRF in Advantage eClinical. In addition, 
investigators should report any SAE that occurs after consent and prior to randomization that 
is assessed as related to invasiv e study -related procedures apart from the HCT. From the time 
of randomization through 30 days after the end of study drug, non -serious A Es are required 
to be reported via event -driven forms in Advantage eClinical. SAEs, irrespective of the 
attribution of t he event to the study drug/procedure/treatment, will be reported through the 
expedited AE reporting system via Advantage eClinical, and will be graded according to the 
CTCAE  Version  4.03. SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
will receive summary reports of all unexpected SAEs in an expedited manner and a summary 
of all adverse experiences at least twice yearly.  
For this study, GVHD and infectio n are only to be reported as SAE s if one of the following 
conditions is met: 1) the event is both related to study drug and also meets the definition of 
SAEs above , or 2) the event results in death that occurs within [ADDRESS_1240537] ug. 
AML relapse will not be reported as an AE/SAE term unless it is the cause of a death that 
occurs between the first day of study drug though [ADDRESS_1240538] dose of study drug 
(inclusive).  
4.6.7.  Monitoring of Common SAEs  
Common SAEs are those events an ticipated to occur in the study population independent of 
drug exposure.  SAEs classified as “common” are provided in APPENDIX K  Common SAEs 
for reference . The list does NOT change reporting obligations or prevent the need to report an 
SAE as detailed above. The purpose of this list is to provide events reported as SAEs that 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240539] 19, 2022  
4-21 may not require expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities based on the classifi cation 
of “common SAEs.” Investigators must report individual occurrences of these events as 
stated in Section  4.6.[ADDRESS_1240540] menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy result, neonatal data and 
other related information will be requested.  If a participant becomes pregnant during the 
study dosing  period, the study drug will be discontinued.  
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome. Additional information regarding the 
outcome of a pregnancy (which  is categorized as an SAE) is mentioned below.  
● “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion  
● Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study drug  
● If an inf ant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study drug is judged as “possible” by 
[CONTACT_093]  
● In the case of a delivery of a living newborn, the “normality” of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth  
● Unless a congenital anomaly are identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embryo or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by [CONTACT_886527] d elivery/birth and 6 months and 12 months after 
birth.  
4.6.9.  Emergency Procedures and Management of Overdose  
In the event of suspected gilteritinib (ASP2215) overdose, the participant should receive 
supportive care and monitoring. The Sponsor Medical Monitor or Study Chair should be

5-1 CHAPTER 5  
 
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
5.1. Study Design and Objectives  
The study is  a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized Phase III, multi -center trial 
comparing gilteritinib as maintenance therapy vs placebo, in FLT3/ITD AML participants in 
first morphologic CR who are undergoing a n HCT.  Randomization will start between days 
[ADDRESS_1240542], after the participant has engrafted.  The target number of participants 
randomized is 346, 173 for each arm.  To account for an anticipated 35% dropout between 
enrollment (at transplant) and randomization post -transplant, 532 participan ts are expected to 
enroll at the time of transplant in order to get the targeted number randomized.   
5.1.1.  Accrual  
It is estimated that approximately 2 years (24 months) of accrual will be necessary to enroll 
the targeted sample size.  
5.1.2.  Randomization  
Participants  will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 between the treatment arm and the placebo 
arm using permuted blocks of random sizes.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_886528] (myeloablative vs reduced intensity/non -myeloablative), time 
from transplant to randomization (30 -60 days vs 61 -90 days), and the presence of MRD 
(present vs absent/unknown) based on the pre -transplant BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].   
5.1.3.  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is RFS, treated as a time to event outcome.  The primary analy sis will 
be performed using the intent -to-treat principle so that all randomized participants will be 
included in the analysis.  Morphological  relapse or death will be considered failures for this 
endpoint, which will be adjudicated by a blinded endpoint r eview committee. The Blinded 
Endpoint Review Committee will assess relapse according to the Blinded Endpoint Review 
Committee Charter.  
5.1.4.  Primary Hypothesis  
The primary null hypothesis is that there is no difference in RFS between the treatment arm 
and place bo.  Using a hazard ratio (HR) to denote the RFS primary endpoint for the treatment 
arm compared to the placebo, the primary hypotheses are:  
H0: HR  = 1 vs H a: HR   ≠ 1  
This hypothesis will be tested at a 0.05 significance level.   
5.1.5.  Duration of Follow -up 
All participants may remain on treatment for up to 24 months (730 days)  following the 
initiation of study drug . The primary analysis will occur 2.[ADDRESS_1240543]. If RFS is not statistically significant or both RFS and OS 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240544] for 2.5 to 5 .5 years if the R FS is not 
statistically significant or if both the RFS and OS are statistically significant at the primary 
analysis; otherwise, study duration for an individual participant will last up to 5 to 8 years.  
5.1.6.  Definition of Analysis Populations  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Efficacy Analysis Population  
The intention -to-treat (ITT) population will serve as the population for primary efficacy 
analysis. All randomized participants will be included in this population. Participants will be 
included in the treatment group to which they are randomize d.  Participants who are 
randomized but do not start therapy will not be replaced.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety Analysis Population  
The safety analysis population will serve as the population for all summaries of the safety 
data.  The safety analysis population consists of all participants who took at least 1 dose of 
study drug (gilteritinib or placebo).  Participants will be analyzed based on the actual 
treatment received.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Population  
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS) consists of the population adm inistered at least 
1 dose of study drug (gilteritinib), have at least [ADDRESS_1240545]. Any formal definitions 
for exclusion of participants or time -points from the PKAS will be documented in the 
Classification Specifications.  
5.2. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
The primary analysis will be done using stratified log -rank tests, with the randomization 
factors used as stratification variables.  RFS in the control group is assumed to be 67% at 
1 year, 59% at 2 years, and 55% at 3 years, based on CIBMTR data on patients with 
FLT3/ITD mutation transplanted in CR1 who were alive and  progression free at 60 days. A 
total of 122  events provide 85% power to detect a HR of 0.57 (corresponding to a 15% 
difference in 2  year RFS) with two -sided significance level of 0.05.   This assumes that the 
survival function in the control group has pi[INVESTIGATOR_886475], that the treatment arm has proportional hazards with a HR of 0.57, and maximum 
follow -up of 3 years (Note that CIBMTR data indicates that very few events occur after 3 
years so there is little benefit in longe r follow -up).  Assuming approximately 2 years of 
accrual and 5% drop out rate per year, 346 participants need to be enrolled to ensure a high 
likelihood of obtaining 122 events.    
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240546] participant  randomized.  This will provide approximately 78 .6% power with two -sided 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_1240547] number of RFS events and corresponding 
power will be specified in the finalized SAP for the primary an alysis.  
An O’Brien -Fleming type alpha -spending function will be utilized to control the overall 
2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1240548] participant randomized, respectively.  Based on the information fraction of 0.83 
(83/100), the study  will pro vide approximately 55% power at the primary analysis  with 
2-sided p -value boundary of 0.0278 and approximately 69.9% power at the final analysis 
with [ADDRESS_1240549] number of OS events at the final analysis and adjusted p -value boundary based on 
the actual information fraction used at the primary analysis will be specified in the finalized 
SAP for the final analysis.  
5.3. Interim Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_886476] -specific DSMB Charter Addendum. RFS with immature data may be participant  to 
overestimation; the data  are not robust and is rarely reproducible when more mature data are 
available. For this reason, early evaluation may lead to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_886477], a nd 
therefore the DSMB will not stop the trial due to differences in RFS. Toxicity, AEs, and 
other safety endpoints will be monitored regularly and reported to the DSMB at each 
meeting.  
5.3.1.  Guidelines for Safety Monitoring  
Monitoring of a key safety endpoint wi ll be conducted monthly, and if rates significantly 
exceed preset thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified so that the DSMB can be advised.  The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_886478] “sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]” that would mandate automatic closure of study 
enrollment.  
The key safety endpoint for this study is mortality.  The rate of mortality will be monitored 
up to [ADDRESS_1240550] randomization among FLT3+ AML patients who are alive without 
progression at day [ADDRESS_1240551] -transplant is ≤ 15%, based on CIBMTR data.  Each mont h, the 
null hypothesis that the 90 -day mortality rate is less than or equal to 15% is tested.  An 
extension of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for censored exponential data will be 
used for monitoring, as described in greater detail below and in APPENDIX E . 
This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error at 5% across all of the monthly 
examinations for a treatment arm.  The SPRT can be repr esented graphically.  At each 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240552] 19, 2022  
5-4 monthly interim analysis, the total time on study in months (x axis) is plotted against the total 
number of endpoints (y axis) (e.g., participants experiencing death).  The continuation region 
of the SPRT is defined by [CONTACT_886529].  Only the upper boundary will be used for 
monitoring to protect against excessive [ADDRESS_1240553], 
summed for all participants on study.  
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities  and  of 
rejecting H 0 when  = 0 and of accepting H 1 when  = 1, respectively, and the expected 
sample size E(N| i).  The tests to be used in this protocol were developed from the following 
SPRT:   
A SPRT contrasting 15% versus 25% 90 -day rate of mortality results in decision 
boundaries with a common slope of 0.073 and an upper intercept of 4.251, with 
nominal type I and II errors of 7.5% and 15%, respectively.  
The actual operating characteristics of the truncated test, shown in Table  7, were determined 
in a simulation study that  assumed uniform accrual of 173 individuals over a 24 -month time 
period, and exponential time to failure after randomization.   
Table  7 Operating Characteristics of Sequential Testing Procedure from a 
Simulation Study with [ZIP_CODE] Rep lications  
DAY 90 MORTALITY  
True 90 -Day Rate  15%  20%  25%  
Probability Reject Null  0.047  0.427  0.901  
Mean Month Stopped  26.2  21.0  12.5  
Mean # Endpoints in 90 Days  25.2  26.9  19.8  
Mean # Participants Enrolled  168.5  139.0  87.9  
For example, the testing procedure rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 5% 
of the time when the true 90 -day mortality rate is 15%, and 90% of the time when the rate is 
25%.  This corresponds to a type I error rate of  = 0.05 and a type II error rate of  = 0.1.  
When the true 90 -day mortality rate is 25%, on average, the DSMB will be consulted 
[ADDRESS_1240554] been observed in 88 participants.  
5.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline  characteristics will be summarized for all participants.  
Characteristics to be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity (if available), performance 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240555] taken subsequent AML 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_886479] .  A sensitivity analysis will also be conducted to assess whether any 
random imbalances in the intensity of preparative regimen or the planned GVHD prophylaxis 
affected the RFS outcome, by [CONTACT_886530].  Finally, the proportional hazards assumption for the Cox model using graphical 
methods and time -dependent covariates will be assessed and if there is evidence that this 
assumption is violated, adjusted RFS curves will be generated, and adjusted RFS 
probabilities will be compared between the groups at 2 and 3 years.  Additional details 
regarding RFS events , primary analysis and sensitivity analyses are provided in the SAP.  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240556] 19, 2022  
5-6 5.5.3.  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Overall Survival  
OS will be a key secondary endpoint, with explicit control of the type I error rate through a 
gatekeeper approach.  Formal significance testing of OS will be conducted if the RFS 
comparison is statistically significant.  Otherwise, survival analyses will b e considered 
exploratory.  Primary analysis for OS will be performed when the primary analysis for RFS is 
statistically significant at 2 -sided α = 0.05.  If the primary analysis for RFS is statistically 
significant while the primary analysis for OS is not statistically significant, a f inal analysis 
for OS will occur [ADDRESS_1240557] of crossover after unblinding on OS will be 
performed.  Details of these analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Non-relapse Mortality (NRM)  
Incidence of NRM will be  estimated using the cumulative incidence function, treating 
relapse/progression as a competing risk.  Incidence of NRM will be compared between the 
treatment arms using a Fine and Gray model, adjusting for strata variables of conditioning 
regimen intensit y (myeloablative vs reduced intensity/non -myeloablative), time from 
transplant to randomization, and pre -transplant MRD status.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relapse  
Incidence of relapse will be estimated using cumulative incidence function, treating death in 
remission as a competing  risk.  Incidence of relapse/progression will be compared between 
the treatment arms using a Fine and Gray model, adjusting for strata variables of conditioning 
regimen intensity (myeloablative vs reduced intensity/non -myeloablative), time from 
transplant to randomization, and pre -transplant MRD status.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Event -free Survival (EFS)  
EFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier estimator applied to the ITT population, and 
compared between treatment groups using the stratified log -rank test, with the same strata 
variables as for the primary endpoint.  The HR, along with confidence intervals, will be 
estimated from a stratified Cox model with treatment group as a covariate. The reason for 
participants starting new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the types of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_886480] l be described in 
each arm. EFS considers discontinuation of study drug or initiation of an anticancer treatment 
to be an event.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Acute GVHD of Grades II -IV and III -IV 
Cumulative incidence of new onset aGVHD or worsening in the grade of aGVHD at the time 
of randomization by [CONTACT_438154] (e.g. , grade II aGVHD at the time of randomization, 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240558] 19, 2022  
5-7 progressing to grade III or more after randomization) will be estimated from the time of 
randomization using the cumulative incidence function, treating death prior to aGVHD as the 
competing risk.  Cumulative incidence of aGVHD will be compared between treatment arms 
using a Fine and Gray model, adjusting for strata variables of conditioning regimen intensity 
(myeloablative vs reduced intensity/non -myeloablative), time from tr ansplant to 
randomization, and pre -transplant MRD status. An additional analysis will be performed  
treating death and relapse without documentation of an aGVHD event as a competing risk.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Chronic GVHD  
Cumulative incidence of new onset chronic GVHD from the  time of randomization or 
worsening in the grade of chronic GVHD at the time of randomization by [CONTACT_438154] (e.g., 
mild chronic GVHD at the time of randomization, progressing to moderate or severe chronic 
GVHD after randomization) will be estimated using th e cumulative incidence function, 
treating death prior to chronic GVHD as the competing risk.  Cumulative incidence of 
chronic GVHD will be compared between treatment arms using a Fine and Gray model, 
adjusting for strata variables of conditioning regimen i ntensity (myeloablative vs reduced 
intensity/non -myeloablative), time from transplant to randomization, and pre -transplant MRD 
status.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Infection  
The number of infections and the number of participant s experiencing infections will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_180890], CTCAE grade  and time period after transplant. The 
cumulative incidence of CTCAE grade 3 to 5 infections, treating death (grade 5) as a 
competing event, will be compared among the treatment ar ms using Gray’s test.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relative Dose Intensity  
Relative Dose Intensity is defined as the percentage of the planned number of doses of study 
drug which are actually taken by [CONTACT_2299]. Descriptive statistics for study drug dose 
intensity  will be presen ted for the safety population by [CONTACT_1570].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Extent of Exposure  
Exposure to treatment, measured by [CONTACT_886531] , will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_68164].  The number and proportion of 
particip ants with dose reduction and dose interruption will be tabulated.

by [CONTACT_1570], SOC and PT. Distribution of SAEs, dis continuations due to AE and 
deaths on study will be presented for each treatment group.  
Additional summary tables will be generated for the following population subsets: 
participants with SAEs including deaths, participants who discontinue due to AEs and 
investigator -attributed relationship to study drug for AEs and SAEs.  
All summaries of AEs will include only treatment -emergent events unless otherwise stated. 
Listings of AEs, SAEs, deaths and withdrawals due to AEs will be presented.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Laboratory Assessments   
Clinical laboratory evaluations (including serum chemistry, LFTs, thyroid tests, hematology) 
and their changes from baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_53846]. 
Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory values will be p resented for each treatment. 
Shift tables will present shift from baseline to worst grade for selected variables using the 
CTCAE grade and laboratory reference range indicator. Frequency of participants with 
laboratory values outside normal range will be g enerated in addition to tabulation of worst 
toxicity grade.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Physical Examination  
All clinically significant abnormal findings will be recorded as medical history, AEs, 
infection or GVHD and graded using either CTCAE guidelines or according to standard 
criteria for GVHD.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Electrocardiograms  
The 12 -lead ECG results will be summarized by [CONTACT_11571]. Overall 
ECG interpretation will be summarized for each time point. A shift analysis table showing 
shifts from baseline in overall ECG (normal, abnormal) will be provided. ECG parameters

Karnofsky performance status scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_6982].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Post- transplant MRD Status  
The cumulative incidence of detection of MRD in participants who are MRD undetectable 
prior to randomization will be described in each group and compared between treatment arms 
using Gray’s test; death without detection o f MRD will be treated as a competing risk.  
Similarly, the time until eradication of MRD in participants who have detectable MRD prior 
to randomization will also be described and compared between treatment arms using Gray’s 
test; death without eradication of MRD will be treated as a competing risk.

5-9 5.5.4.  Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Health -Related Quality of Life (HQL)  
HQL will be measured on day -30, day -14, day 29, month  3, month  6, month  12, month  18 
and EOT (month  24) using three instruments: the FACT -BMT, FACT -Leu, and EQ -5D-5L.  
HQL at each time point will be summarized using simple descriptive statistics (mean, SD) 
and simple comparisons between treatment arms will be performed using t -tests. 
EQ-5D-5L VAS will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070] (mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, maximum  and median) on ITT.  Additionally , change from 
baseline  will be calculated as the post -baseline score minus the baseline score and 
summarized  in the same way.  Analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model will be used to 
evaluate change from baseline to post -baseline for the EQ -5D-5L VAS including treatment  
and stratification factors  as fixed factors.  Shift table showing shift in each dimension score  
from baseline to each post -baseline visit will be provided for the 5  dimensions (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression).  
FACT -Leu global score and domain scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_886532] e statistics ( mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median ) on ITT.  
Additionally, change from baseline  will be calculated as the post -baseline value  minus the 
baseline value and summarized in the same way.  ANCOVA model will be used to evaluate 
change from baseline to post -baseline for the global and domain scores, individual items and 
item clusters of the FACT -Leu treatment  and stratification factors  as fixed factors . 
FACT -BMT score will be summarized by [CONTACT_886533] (mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median ) on ITT.  Additionally, change from 
baseline  will be calculated as the post -baseline value  minus the baseline value and 
summarized in the same way.  ANCOVA model will be used to evaluate change from  
baseline to post -baseline scores in cluding treatment  and stratification factors  as fixed factors . 
Additional exploratory analyses of  resource utilization, participant  reported outcomes 
(FACT -BMT, FACT -Leu) and health outcome (EQ -5D-5L) will be performed a nd the details 
will be included in a separate Patient Reported Outcome Statistical Analysis Plan . 
Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) will also be predefined in the separate 
Patient Reported Outcome Statistical Analysis Plan.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Healthcare Resource Utilization  
Descriptive analyses of healthcare resource utilization will be conducted for antibiotic use, 
medication for AEs, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886481]. Additional analyses may be p erformed and reported separately.  
Resource utilization counts  including duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], duration of medications and 
duration of antibiotic use will be summarized by [CONTACT_2070] 
(mean, standard deviation, minimum , maximum and median) on ITT. The difference between 
treatment groups will be tested with ANOVA while controlling of stratification factors .

aGRFS, cGRFS and GRFS will be analyzed on the ITT in the same manner as RFS . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analys es will be conducted for RFS for each of the following variables: 
pre-transplant MRD status at enrollment, MRD status at randomization, CR status prior to 
randomization, time from transplant to randomization, age, gender, region, incidence of 
FLT3 mutation  at relapse, conditioning regimen intensity , cytogenic risk factor  and GVHD 
prophylaxis. Interaction tests between treatment group and subgroup will be conducted 
within a Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment, subgroup, and a 
treatment*s ubgroup interaction term.  A forest plot will be used to show the HR  for each 
subgroup.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Gilteritinib Plasma Pharmacokinetics  
Gilteritinib plasma concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], visit, and time point (in 
hours). Based on pharmacokinetic data  obtained within this study, a separate population 
pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed. Data from this study may be pooled with other 
studies for analysis. The prospective details of this analysis will be specified in a separate 
population pharmacok inetic analysis plan.  
5.5.5.  Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows and Other Information  
As a general principle, no imputation of missing data will occur during analysis. Exceptions 
are the start and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medication. The i mputed dates will be 
used to determine whether an AE is/is not treatment -emergent or a medication is/is not 
concomitant. Listings of the AEs and concomitant medications will present the actual partial 
dates; imputed dates will not be shown.  
The definition  for windows to be used for analyses by [CONTACT_765], if applicable, will be outlined in 
the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

designee should transcribe data (including laboratory values, if applicable) in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF) in a timely manner after the participant visit unless otherwise noted.  
The BMT CTN DCC will be reviewing form submission regularly and will follow -up to 
assure data is submitted promptly.  
The investig ator or site designee is responsible for ensuring that all data in the eCRFs and 
queries are accurate and complete and that all entries are verifiable with source documents. 
These documents should be appropriately maintained by [CONTACT_779].  
The monitor will v erify a subset of the data in the eCRFs with source documents and confirm 
that there are no inconsistencies between them.  
Study Documentation  
Study documentation includes, but is not limited to, all CRFs, workbooks, source documents, 
monitoring logs and ap pointment schedules, sponsor -investigator correspondence, and signed 
protocol and amendments, IRB/IEC correspondence and approved current and previous 
consent forms and signed participant consent forms.  
Source documents include all recordings of observatio ns or notations of clinical activities and 
all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research 
study.  The original recording of an observation should be retained as the source document. If 
the original recordin g of an observation is the electronic record, that will be considered the 
source.  
Clinical Study Monitoring  
The Sponsors or delegated CROs are responsible for monitoring the clinical study to ensure 
that the participant’s human rights, safety and well -being are protected, that the study is 
properly conducted in adherence with the current protocol and GCP and study data reported 
by [CONTACT_093]/sub -investigator are accurate and complete, and that they are verifiable 
with study -related records such as sou rce documents.   The Sponsors or delegated CROs are 
responsible for assigning study monitor(s) to this study for proper monitoring.  The protocol 
will be monitored in accordance with planned monitoring procedures.  
Direct Access to Source Data/Documents  
The investigator and the study site must accept monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_886536]/IEC and relevant regulatory authorities. 
In these instances, they must provide all study -related records and documentat ion when they 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240571] 19, 2022  
C-3 are requested by [CONTACT_190936], the IRB/IEC or regulatory authorities. 
The confidentiality of the participant's identities shall be well protected consistent with local 
and national regulations when the source documents ar e subject to direct access.  
Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor is implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems 
with written SOPs to ensure that the trial is conducted and data are generated, documented, 
recorded and reported in com pliance with the protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).  
The Sponsor or Sponsor's designee may arrange to audit the clinical study at any or all 
investigational sites and facilities. The audit may include on -site review of regulatory 
docume nts, CRFs and source documents. Direct access to these documents will be required 
by [CONTACT_77811].  
Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is generally an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented or intended as a systematic change. T he investigator is responsible for ensuring 
the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this 
protocol and must protect the rights, safety and welfare of participants. The investigator 
should not implement any devia tion from or changes of, the protocol, unless it is necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants.  
A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an investigator to 
deviate from the protocol. Protocol waivers a re strictly prohibited.  
For the purposes of this protocol, deviations requiring  notification to Sponsor are defined as 
any participant who:  
● Entered into the study and did not satisfy entry criteria.  
● Developed withdrawal criteria during the study and was not withdrawn from the study.  
● Received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose.  
● Received excluded concomitant treatment.  
When a deviation from the protocol  is identified for an individual participant, the investigator 
or designee must ensure the Sponsor or  designee is notified. The Sponsor or designee will 
follow up with the investigator, as applicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact 
to the safety and/or efficacy of the participant to determine participants  continuation in the 
study.  
If a deviation impacts the safety of a participant, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_29019].  
The investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory 
authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropri ately. All documentation and 
communications to the IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory authorities will be provided to the 
Sponsor and maintained within the Trial Master File.

LIVER SAFETY MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT  
 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240611] 19, 2022  
J-2 APPENDIX J  
LIVER SAFETY MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT  
Any participant enrolled in a clinical study with active drug therapy and reveals an increase 
of serum aminotransferases to > 3 × upper limit of normal ( ULN ; to > 5 × ULN in 
participants with liver metastases) or total bilirubin (TBL)  > 2 × ULN, should und ergo 
detailed testing for liver enzymes (including at least alanine aminotransferase  [ALT ], 
aspartate aminotransferase  [AST ], alkaline phosphatase [ALP] and TBL) . Testing should be 
repeated within [ADDRESS_1240612]:  
  ALT or AST   TBL  
Moderate  > [ADDRESS_1240613] (in participants without liver 
metastases), > [ADDRESS_1240614] (in participants with 
liver metastases)  or > [ADDRESS_1240615]  
    
Severe†  > [ADDRESS_1240616]  and > [ADDRESS_1240617] severe hepatic abnormalities for any 
of the following:  
● ALT or AST > 8  × ULN  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in the absence of liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and International normalization ratio (INR) > 1.5 (If INR 
testing is applicable/evaluated).  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nau sea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
The investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up. 
Follow -up Procedures  
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly 
characterized by [CONTACT_317257], detailed pertinent history, 
physical examination an d laboratory tests.  The site should complete the Liver Abnormality -
CRF (LA -CRF) or appropriate document.  Participants with confirmed abnormal liver 
function testing should be followed as described below.  
Confirmed moderately abnormal LFTs should be repea ted 2 - 3 times weekly then weekly or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the participant is 
asymptomatic.  
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240618] 19, 2022  
J-3 Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology, may be con sidered an important medical event and may be reported as an SAE.  
The Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_886541].  
To further assess abn ormal hepatic laboratory findings, the investigator is expected to:  
● Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  New -onset  
diseases should be recorded as “AEs” in Advantage eClinical. Symptoms are recorded on 
the LA -CRF.  I llnesses and conditions such as hypotensive events and decompensated 
cardiac disease that may lead to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted.  
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in obese hyperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic 
participants and may be  associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The 
investigator should ensure that the medical history form captures any illness that predates 
study enrollment that may be relevant in assessing hepatic function.  
● Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medication page of the eCRF. Information on alcoh ol, other substance use and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.  
● Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
● Based on the participant’s history, other testing may be appropriate including:  
o acute viral hepatiti s (A,  B, C, D, E or other infectious agents)  
o ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease  
o other laboratory tests including PT or INR, direct bilirubin  
● Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
● Submit results for any additional t esting and possible etiology on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.  
Study Discontinuation  
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease, presence of liver metastases or exposure to other  agents associated with 
liver injury, the participant may be discontinued from the study. The investigator may 
determine that it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue study enrollment. 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:  
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in participants without liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated)  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN (in participants w ith liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
In addition, if close monitoring for a participant with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory 
tests is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

CHARACTERIZATION OF CONDITIONING REGIMENS  
 
Myeloablative Conditioning (MAC)*  Reduced Intensity/Non -Myeloablative 
Conditioning (RIC/NMA)  
 MAC regimens are defined as regimens 
containing:  
• Total body irradiation (TBI) ≥ 5  Gy 
single dose or ≥ 8 Gy fractionated, or  
• Busulfan > 8 mg/kg PO or 6.4 mg/kg 
IV (total dose), or  
• Treosulfan > [ZIP_CODE] mg/m2 (or 
> 30 g/m2), or 
• Melphalan > 150 mg/m2, or 
• Thiotepa ≥ 10 mg/kg.   Any regimen that does not meet criteria to 
be defined as MAC regim en will be 
characterized as RIC/NMA  
MAC: myeloablative conditioning; NMA: non-myeloablative ; RIC: reduced intensity conditioning; TBI: total 
body irradiation  
*New agents, dosing or regimens that are developed during the study that may be considered myeloablative and 
are not documented in the protocol will be documented in the conditioning regimen adjudication charter and 
will be included in the next available protocol amendment .

CORRELATIVE LABORATORY STUDIES  
 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  FLT3 Maintenance  Protocol – [ADDRESS_1240627] 
goal is to assess the correlation of a standardized assay for minimal residual disease (MRD) 
with survival and relapse. These results could inform future study designs of FLT3 inhibitors. 
A fourth  goal will be to correlate the presence or absence (at diagnosis or during therapy) of 
AML -associated mutations (such as NPM1) with trial endpoints. A fifth goal will be to assess 
FLT3 mutation status at the time of relapse.  
As detailed in the Informed Con sent document, all participants in this study will have the 
opportunity to give consent to allow the trial investigators and their designated affiliates 
access to any diagnostic material (BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_886491], or DNA or RNA derived therefrom) 
available.  I t is recognized that diagnostic material may be available for only a subset of 
participants.  The diagnostic material will be used to 1) compare with the results of local 
testing for a FLT3/ITD mutation; 2) estimate the FLT3/ITD mutant -to-wild type allelic  ratio 
present at diagnosis; and 3)  assay for the presence of AML -associated mutations (for 
example, DNMT3a, NPM1).  Those diagnostic samples that are already stored at 
Invivoscribe will not be available for central banking with the BMT CTN as they are the  
property of Invivoscribe (which maintains a policy of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_886492] a 15 year 
period).  
Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_886493] ( Table  4; Schedule of Assessments).  
During the BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_173299], the first pull (approximately 2 mL) of the marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_886494] t o the Reference Laboratory (Invivoscribe).  The 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_886495] a next -generation sequencing (NGS) -
based test.  The results of this MRD assay represent a key secondary endpoint of this trial, 
and will be correlated wit h relapse and survival endpoints.  
Specimens collected for MRD will be stored at the reference laboratory until completion of 
the study (and all designated correlative lab studies or bridging studies if required by 
[CONTACT_12721]), and then samples from North American participants will be 
transferred to the BMT CTN for storage and possible future use by [CONTACT_886544].

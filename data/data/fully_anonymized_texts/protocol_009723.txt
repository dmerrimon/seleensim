Objective:  To determine the effect of non-invasive brain stimulation on anxiety and 
anxiety-cognition interactions in healthy subjects. Toward this aim we will test the effect 
of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on two outcome measures: 1) Fear and 
anxiety during the threat of predictable and unpredictable shock (NPU threat test), and 2) 
Working memory (WM) related anxiety downregulation while performing the Sternberg 
WM task under threat of shock.  
Study population:   The study population will consist of up to 184 healthy volunteers
between the ages of 18-50. 
Design:  This study will consists of two (sub-studies 1 and 2) or three (sub-study 3) 
outpatient visits (1 MRI, 1 or 2 TMS visits [2 for sub-study 3]). In this protocol we will 
explore the effect of TMS in three sub-studies in the TMS study visit. The sub-studies 
will contain either the NPU or the Sternberg task during the TMS visits. The first visit 
(MRI) will consist of the same procedures for all sub-studies. Each subject will be 
assigned to only one of the sub-studies.  
 
Sternberg Task: Expose subjects to active or sham TMS to a region of the frontoparietal 
attention network during the Sternberg WM task. Subjects will have to maintain a series 
of letters in WM for a brief interval during blocks of safety and threat of shock.  
 
NPU Task: Expose subjects to active or sham TMS to a region of the frontoparietal 
attention network during the NPU threat test. Subjects will be exposed to blocks in which 
they are either 1) safe from shock (neutral), 2) at risk of shock delivered only during a 
cue (predictable), or 3) at risk of shock presented randomly (unpredictable).  
 
Outcome measures: In both studies the primary outcome measure will be anxiety-
potentiated startle (APS), which is the increase in startle magnitude during periods of 
threat compared to periods of safety. We expect active, but not sham TMS to increase 
activity in the dlPFC, and therefore reduce APS in both studies.

page 9 of 52 1. Introduction and Background 
a. Background 
The relationship between cognition and anxiety is complex and bidirectional (Robinson 
et al., 2013b; Vytal et al., 2012, 2013). Difficult tasks typi[INVESTIGATOR_734533], but 
performance on these tasks can suffer when individuals are in an anxious state. The 
mechanisms behind this bidirectional relationship are not yet known. Indeed, most 
prominent theories on the relationship between anxiety and cognition focus on the effect 
of anxiety on cognition, and largely ignore the effect of cognition on anxiety (Eysenck et 
al., 2007). As a result, the mechanisms underlying the reduction in anxiety during 
cognitive tasks remain largely unexplored. A better understanding of mechanisms 
involved in anxiety down regulation has clinical implications. For instance, individuals 
with anxiety disorders frequently suffer from attentional problems, such as being easily 
distracted and unable to focus on ongoing tasks. In fact, one of the core symptoms of 
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is “difficulty concentrating”(American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013). Such susceptibility to distraction has been linked to competition 
between task-relevant and task-irrelevant (e.g., worry) thoughts in working memory 
(WM) (Eysenck et al., 2007). To study this relationship in healthy subjects, it is possible 
to experimentally induce anxiety using the threat of shock paradigm.  
Threat of shock is a well-validated (Grillon and Ameli, 1998; Lang et al., 1990), 
translational procedure (Grillon, 2008a; Grillon et al., 1994; Morgan et al., 1995; 
Robinson et al., 2012b), previously shown to increase state anxiety (Dunning et al., 2013; 
Hansen et al., 2009; Robinson et al., 2013b; Vytal et al., 2014), cause worry (Grillon, 
2002, 2008b), and interfere with task performance (Balderston et al., 2015; Clarke and 
Johnstone, 2013; Lavric et al., 2003; Robinson et al., 2011, 2013a). In a typi[INVESTIGATOR_734534], subjects are exposed to alternating blocks in which they are safe, or at 
risk for receiving an unpleasant electrical stimulation. Because the shock can be delivered 
infrequently, it is possible to superimpose a wide variety of tasks onto these alternating 
blocks, with little interference from the actual shock presentations, making this paradigm 
ideal for experimentally testing the effects of anxiety on cognitive processes, and their 
underlying neural mechanisms.  
 
It is clear from resting state studies that threat of shock changes patterns of functional 
connectivity even in the absence of a cognitive task (McMenamin et al., 2014; 
McMenamin and Pessoa, 2015; Robinson et al., 2012a), and our data suggest that these 
resting state changes may be most robust in parietal regions of the frontoparietal attention 
network (FPN), potentially reflecting a state of threat induced hypervigilance (Balderston 
et al., 2017). Therefore, successful performance of a task during this altered baseline state 
may require additional cognitive control, when compared to non-threat periods. One 
candidate region that may be involved in this implicit emotion regulation is the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Indeed, the dlPFC has been repeatedly shown to 
play a role in WM (Altamura et al., 2007; Barbey et al., 2013; Curtis and D’Esposito, 
2003; Feredoes et al., 2011; Geier et al., 2007), anxiety (Bishop, 2009; Forster et al., 
2015; Nitschke et al., 2006; Peers et al., 2013; Shang et al., 2014), and emotional learning 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 10 of 52 (Carter et al., 2006). Studies with high anxious healthy controls have also implicated the 
dlPFC in anxiety/task interactions (Basten et al., 2011, 2012; Bishop, 2009; Eysenck et 
al., 2007; Fales et al., 2008; Telzer et al., 2008). In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we show that even low 
load tasks activate the dlPFC under threat of shock, but that this activity is increased as 
cognitive load is increased. 
Together these results suggest that the FPN plays a key role in the interaction between 
anxiety and cognition, however the nature of this role is unclear. We propose a novel 
model based on the frontoparietal attention network (FPN) 27. According to our model, 1) 
elevated state anxiety enhances bottom-up attentional processes, mediated by [CONTACT_734557], and 2) top-down cognitive control processes, mediated by [CONTACT_28899], 
counteract this enhancement, reducing anxiety. This model is an extension and 
integration of the arousal theory of parietal cortex asymmetry, which states asymmetries 
in parietal activity reflect arousal processes 28, and the attention control theory, which 
states that anxious individuals cannot efficiently engage goal-directed attention 29. 
Importantly, this model can be experimentally tested using TMS. TMS to the dlPFC was 
recently approved by [CONTACT_4760] a second-line treatment for depression (Horvath et al., 
2010; O’Reardon et al., 2007; Shajahan et al., 2002; Stern et al., 2007), and some studies 
have shown that TMS can reduce comorbid symptoms of anxiety in depressed individuals 
(Mantovani et al., 2013; O’Reardon et al., 2007; White and Tavakoli, 2015). TMS uses a 
strong magnetic current at the scalp to induce electrical currents in neurons just below the 
TMS coil. rTMS is capable of altering the resting membrane potentials of local neurons 
(Lefaucheur et al., 2014). rTMS at low frequencies (<5 Hz) tends to decrease local 
excitability, while rTMS at high frequencies (>5 Hz) tends to increase local excitability 
(Di Lazzaro et al., 2011). Therefore, 5 Hz rTMS should facilitate dlPFC activity, and 
according to our hypothesis this dlPFC stimulation in the absence of a task should inhibit 
threat-related processing, resulting in an overall decrease in anxiety. 
 
One variant of the threat of shock paradigm is the so-called NPU paradigm, where 
subjects are exposed to simple cues during blocks of no threat (N), predictable threat (P), 
and unpredictable threat (U) (Schmitz and Grillon, 2012). During this paradigm, simple 
geometric shapes serve as cues (presented for 8 s). During the predictable threat blocks, 
these cues indicate that a shock may occur, while during the unpredictable and neutral 
blocks, these cues are not predictive of the shock. During the no threat blocks subjects are 
instructed that they are completely safe from shocks, and during the unpredictable blocks, 
subjects are instructed that they could receive a shock at any point. This paradigm 
provides measures of fear (e.g., fear-potentiated startle) associated with the threat cue in 
the P condition and of anxiety (e.g., anxiety-potentiated startle) in the N, P, and U 
contexts (no-cue periods). This paradigm is ideal to test the top-down inhibition 
hypothesis because it allows for the testing of both fear and anxiety, without adding 
additional cognitive demands. In addition, cue presentations during the NPU task activate 
the dlPFC (See below), which may reflect an implicit form of top-down emotion 
regulation.  
 
The purpose of this protocol is to use TMS to determine the role of the FPN in anxiety 
reduction. According to our model, we have [ADDRESS_1003659], suppressing activity in 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 11 of 52 the left parietal cortex with low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS should interfere with the bottom-
up attentional processes associated with elevated state anxiety. Second, enhancing 
activity in the right dlPFC with high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS should facilitate top-down 
cognitive control processes associated with anxiety reduction. Therefore the objective of 
this protocol is to test these hypotheses by [CONTACT_734558]-invasive TMS, 
and measuring the effect of this altered FPN activity on anxiety using anxiety-potentiated 
startle (APS). Importantly, according to the top-down inhibition hypothesis strengthening 
activity the dlPFC with TMS alone (i.e. in the absence of a demanding cognitive task) 
should be sufficient to reduce anxiety, suggesting that we should see an effect in a 
passive task like the NPU paradigm. This is based on the following logic: 1) the dlPFC 
plays a key role in attention control (Basten et al., 2012; Cieslik et al., 2013; Fales et al., 
2008; Harding et al., 2015; Peers et al., 2013), 2) anxiety patients are impaired in their 
ability to recruit this structure for cognitive control (Armstrong et al., 2011; Balderston et 
al., 2016b; Berggren and Derakshan, 2013a, 2013b; Braver et al., 2010; Coombes et al., 
2009; Derryberry and Reed, 2002; Eysenck et al., 2007; Grillon et al., 2015b; Morrison 
and Heimberg, 2013; Najmi et al., 2012, 2014; Price et al., 2011; Reinholdt-Dunne et al., 
2009, 2012). 3) cognitive tasks that occur during periods of elevated state anxiety recruit 
the right dlPFC (See Preliminary Results), 4) tasks that engage the right dlPFC reduce 
state anxiety (Balderston et al., 2016a; Vytal et al., 2012, 2013). However, it is possible 
that some level of prior engagement of the stimulation site is necessary for the 
stimulation to be effective (Luber et al., 2007, 2008, 2013). Therefore we will test the 
effect of TMS on two outcome measures: 1) Fear and anxiety during the NPU task, and 
2) Working memory (WM) related decreases in anxiety during the Sternberg WM task.  
 
b. Significance 
Anxiety disorders affect approximately 18% of the population in a given 1 year period, 
placing a substantial burden on the national health care system (Kessler and Chiu, 2005). 
Anxiety patients suffer from cognitive deficits, which can severely impact their wellbeing 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013). We have shown that these deficits seem to be 
a core feature of anxiety disorders, and that they may be mediated by [CONTACT_734559] (Balderston et al., 2016b). The purpose of this project is to determine whether 
noninvasive stimulation of the FPN can reduce anxiety. Given that TMS is already 
approved by [CONTACT_281447], these results may provide a potential 
avenue for future treatment of anxiety disorders.  
 
c. Preliminary data 
The NPU threat test provides reliable measures of both fear and anxiety. In order to 
understand the relationship between anxiety and cognition, it is important to have a 
reliable method for experimentally manipulating state anxiety independent of cognitive 
tasks. Our lab has repeatedly done this using the NPU threat test (Alvarez et al., 2011; 
Davis et al., 2010; Grillon et al., 1994, 1998, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2015a; 
Robinson et al., 2012b; Schmitz et al., 2011; Schmitz and Grillon, 2012). As mentioned 
above, the NPU threat test consists of blocks of neutral, predictable, and unpredictable 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 12 of 52 threats. During this task, subjects are presented with cues, and these cues signal the shock 
only in the predictable conditions Consistent with our previous work, our current pi[INVESTIGATOR_734535]. At the psychophysiological level, subjects 
show elevated startle to the cue compared to the ITI during the predictable condition, and 
elevated startle during both the cue and ITI in the unpredictable condition (Figure 1).  
 
At the neural level, cues evoke an fMRI pattern of activity consistent with fear in the 
predictable but not the unpredictable condition (Figures 2-3). Importantly, cues during 
both the predictable and unpredictable conditions evoke activity in the dlPFC, a region 
important for cognitive control (See below). 
Anxiety is reduced by [CONTACT_734560] N-back WM paradigm: In our initial studies 
exploring the relationship between cognition and anxiety, we conducted the n-back task 
under threat of shock. In a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] n-back experiment, subjects are required to 
continuously monitor a series of item, and make judgments on each trial according to 
whether the current item matches that presented “N” trials previously. Increasing “N” 
increases the number of items a subject is required to maintain in WM, and therefore the 
cognitive load placed on the subject.  In our n-back studies we found that threat reduces 
performance on this task under low load conditions (Figure 4). In addition, we found that 
under high load conditions, anxiety, as probed with the startle reflex (anxiety-potentiated 
startle or APS) was reduced (Figure 5). Because the n-back task is complex and involves 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 13 of 52 various cognitive processes, it is unclear which mechanism is responsible for the anxiety 
reduction at high loads in this task.  Indeed, the n-back task is highly dependent on 
executive function, requiring simultaneous encoding, maintenance, and retrieval (Kane et 
al., 2007; Owen et al., 2005). Furthermore, during the 2- and 3-back task, subjects must 
also shift their attention away from representations of the intermediate to-be-maintained 
items, further engaging prefrontal cognitive control resources. 
 
Anxiety is reduced by [CONTACT_734561]: Therefore, in an 
effort to better understand the psychological mechanisms underlying the load related 
anxiety reduction, we followed up the N-back studies with the Sternberg WM paradigm 
(Sternberg, 1966). In the Sternberg WM paradigm, subjects are presented with a series of 
letters, and required to maintain this series of letters in WM for a brief maintenance 
interval. After the maintenance interval, subjects are presented with a response prompt, 
which consists of a letter and a number. The letter is chosen from the study series, and the 
number corresponds to a position in the series. At the prompt, subjects are instructed to 
identify whether the position of the letter in the series matches the number. By [CONTACT_734562]-be-encoded letters in a series, it is possible to increase WM load. 
Because simple rehearsal is sufficient to maintain these letters (Altamura et al., 2007), 
this task does not require the engagement of central executive resources (Baddeley, 
1992).  
 
In these follow-up studies, we required subjects to perform the Sternberg task during 
periods of safety and threat. We increased WM load by [CONTACT_734563], and probed subjects anxiety with the startle reflex during the safe or 
threat blocks. Consistent with the previous n-back studies, we found that increasing WM 
load reduces anxiety (APS), when anxiety is probed during the maintenance period, but 
not the ITI (Figure 7). This is true even though the Sternberg task typi[INVESTIGATOR_734536], suggesting that this acute anxiety down-regulation 
can be caused by [CONTACT_734564]. However, unlike the 
previous n-back studies, performance was not impaired under threat of shock (Figure 6), 
suggesting that the central executive processes, rather than maintenance processes were 
impacted by [CONTACT_734565] n-back task.  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 14 of 52 
Threat of shock activates the dlPFC: In addition, in several recent studies we found 
that threat of shock evoked activity in the dlPFC. In Study 1 (n = 37), subjects completed
the NPU task. In Study 2 (n = 36), subjects underwent an incidental pi[INVESTIGATOR_734537], where pi[INVESTIGATOR_734538] (unpredictable) threat. Subjects were simply instructed to indicate whether the 
item presented on each trial could typi[INVESTIGATOR_734539] a house or outside a house. In 
Study 3 (n = 21), subjects completed maintenance and manipulation trials in the 
Sternberg working memory paradigm. On each trial, subjects were presented with a series 
of letters, followed by a brief maintenance interval, followed by a response prompt. On 
maintenance trials, subjects were instructed to maintain the series of letters in working 
memory in their current order. On manipulation trials, subjects were instructed to sort the 
trials in alphabetical order.  In all studies we found a significant cluster of activity over 
the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as a function of threat. Across studies this 
region showed increased cue-evoked activity during threat blocks relative to safe blocks 
(Figures 8-10).  
 
 
Anxiety patients show impaired performance and dlPFC activity during N-back: In 
a recent study we sought to determine whether WM-related deficits in clinical anxiety are 
chronic, or whether they arise due to threat-related processing (e.g. worry). In the latter 
case, one would expect that experimentally-inducing threat would exacerbate the deficits 
in anxiety patients. We tested WM performance during threat of shock and safety in 
anxiety patients and healthy controls, while recording brain activity with functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects performed a spatial N-back working 
memory (WM) task comprising 4 levels of difficulty (i.e., cognitive load), 0-back, 1-
back, 2-back and 3-back conditions. In this study we found that patients were impaired 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 15 of 52 relative to controls across all levels of the N-back task, and that this performance 
impairment was independent of the threat manipulation (Figure 11).  Similarly, the task-
positive BOLD activity in the dlPFC was reduced in patients relative to controls (Figure 
12). These results suggest that poor engagement of the prefrontal cortex (particularly 
dlPFC) in clinical anxiety reflects a core component of the disorder rather than a transient 
effect of threat-related processing (Basten et al., 2011; Bishop, 2009; Telzer et al., 2008).  
 
Threat of shock fundamentally alters the IPS.  In two recent studies, we exposed 
subjects to threat of shock while recording brain activity using MEG or fMRI (See Figure 
2). In the MEG study, subjects received startle probes, and we sampled the MEG activity 
during the [ADDRESS_1003660], we found a significant 
decrease in power during the threat blocks compared to the safe blocks in the alpha band 
over parietal sensors, suggesting an increase in cortical excitability (Klimesch et al., 
2007). We used a beamformer to localize the source of this power decrease, and found a 
large cluster of voxels in the IPS showing a decrease in alpha power in the threat blocks 
compared to the safe blocks.  
In the fMRI study, we assessed functional connectivity during threat blocks vs. 
safe blocks using the whole brain global brain connectivity (GBC) approach. This 
allowed us to assess functional connectivity from threat to safe across the entire brain, 
without specifying a seed-region. This approach allows us to identify the regions of the 
brain that show the most significant changes in connectivity with the rest of the brain as a 
function of our task design, and has previously been used to identify network hubs at the 
whole-brain level (Cole et al., 2010). We found a significant increase in GBC in the 
threat blocks compared to the safe blocks bilaterally in the IPS, showing that this region 
increased its connectivity with the rest of the brain during threat blocks, suggesting that 
this region functions as a network hub for threat-related attentional processes.  
 
TMS pulses evoke transient eyeblink responses due to stimulation of the scalp: In a 
recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we tested the effect of TMS pulses on eyeblink responses. Given that our 
primary outcome measure is startle, we wanted to ensure that stimulation of the scalp 
muscles did not interfere with our ability to record startle evoked eyeblinks. We found 
that TMS pulses (in a 5 Hz train) indeed induce twitches in the orbicularis oculi muscle. 
However, these twitches were small, and the EMG signal recovered within 150 ms of the 
TMS pulse (See Figure 13). When comparing the TMS evoked eyeblink to the acoustic 
starlte reflex, it is clear that the TMS evoked eyeblink has an earlier onset, and a shorter 
duration than the acoustic startle reflex. This difference is likely due to the origin of the 
two blinks. The TMS evoked blink arises due to direct stimulation of the orbicularis 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 16 of 52 oculi, while the blink evoked by [CONTACT_734566] (Blumenthal et al., 2005). 
At a more mechanistic level, we can identify [ADDRESS_1003661] the acoustic startle response: 1) The TMS pulse may interfere with the 
ability of the acoustic startle reflex to activate the fibers innervating the orbicularis oculi. 
We do not believe this will be an issue because orbicularis oculi EMG activity returns to 
baseline within 150 ms of the TMS pulse, which is well below the minimum interval 
between the TMS pulse and the subsequent startle probes; 2) The TMS pulse may trigger 
prepulse inhibition, which is the reduction of startle due to an unexpected preceding 
stimulus. We do not believe this will be an issue because prepulse inhibition is maximal 
at [ADDRESS_1003662] after ~500 ms, which again is well below the minimum 
interval between the TMS pulse and the subsequent startle probes (Hoffman and Fleshler, 
1963; Larrauri and Schmajuk, 2006); 3) The TMS pulse may reduce the predictability of 
the startle probe, thereby [CONTACT_734567]/amplitude of the startle response. We do 
not believe this will be an issue because we startle probes in many of our other 
experiments are somewhat predictable (e.g. the NPU threat paradigm; See Schmitz & 
Grillon, 2012). We also plan to vary the interval between the TMS pulse and the startle 
probe using timing parameters that have shown to be effective in previous studies 
(Balderston et al., 2015, 2016a). In addition, if such an effect would occur, it would be 
balanced across conditions. 
We have made every possible effort to account for the non-specific effects of scalp 
stimulation by [CONTACT_734568]. First, it is important to note that our 
dependent measure in these studies is not the raw startle magnitude, rather it is the change 
in startle magnitudes during periods of safety and threat, and that the stimulation will be 
balanced across these conditions. Therefore, any non-specific effect of scalp stimulation 
on blink magnitude should be eliminated in the difference score. Furthermore, the current 
generated by [CONTACT_941] e-stim placebo coil is similar in magnitude, duration, and distribution to 
the current induced by [CONTACT_28911] (Borckardt et al., 2008; Gonz, Strauss, & 
Schwerdtfeger, 2011; Rossi et al., 2007; Sheffer et al., 2013). In addition, electrically and 
magnetically stimulated blinks are nearly identical to each other in topology (Blumenthal 
et al., 2005). Together, these observations suggest that any non-specific effects of scalp 
stimulation on blink magnitude should be similar for the sham and TMS conditions. 
These results suggest that it will be possible to record startle evoked eyeblinks given a 
sufficient interval between the TMS train and startle probe.

Summary:  Our preliminary data show the following:  
1) Anxiety interferes with WM performance, only during a task that requires central 
executive resources.  
2) WM load is sufficient to reduce anxiety whether or not the WM task engages central 
executive resources.  
3) Even during low load tasks, threat of shock activates the dlPFC.  
4) Anxiety patients show impaired performance and reduced dlPFC activity relative to 
healthy controls during the n-back task.  
5) Threat of shock increase cortical excitability in the parietal cortex, and this 
hyperexcitability may mediate the hypervigilance seen in anxious patients. 
 
 
Based on these preliminary findings, we propose the following model, which is consistent 
with the top-down inhibition hypothesis. According to this model, individuals in an 
anxious state experience worrisome thoughts that can potentially distract them from 
ongoing tasks (especially those that require central executive processes). When task 
demands are high, cognitive control processes (mediated by [CONTACT_685022]) filter out these 
worrisome thoughts. By [CONTACT_734569], these cognitive control 
processes reduce anxiety, as well as the impact of anxiety on ongoing task performance. 
Individuals who are unable to engage these cognitive control processes are less able to 
reduce their anxiety and are therefore more likely to be negatively impacted by [CONTACT_734570].  
2. Study Objectives 
a. Primary objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether altering activity in the FPN
with TMS will reduce anxiety either alone (during NPU) or during a low load cognitive 
task (Sternberg WM).  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page [ADDRESS_1003663] pi[INVESTIGATOR_734540]. The target number of completers for each experiment will be 
N=48 for a total of 144 completers. We anticipate that about 15% of subjects (N=121) 
will either terminate the study during the task because of discomfort. An additional 9 
subjects (3 per experiment) will be included for pi[INVESTIGATOR_28882]. To account for this projected 
attrition rate, we aim for an accrual of 184 medically and psychiatrically healthy 
volunteers including the 10 pi[INVESTIGATOR_28888]. The participants will be adult males and 
females, aged 18 to 50. The accrual ceiling is 184.  Subjects may participate in multiple 
sub-studies, and will be consented each time they are asked to participate in a given 
substudy.   NIH employees may participate. NIMH employees and staff and their 
immediate family members will be excluded from the study per NIMH policy.

Information obtained under the 01-M-[ADDRESS_1003673] in the study.  
 
d. Study procedures 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731]: We will begin with an ~[ADDRESS_1003674] pi[INVESTIGATOR_734541] a TMS probe. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_734542] (control), a TMS pulse, and a sham pulse 
(with electrical stimulation of the scalp). Pulses will be administered at 100% of the MEP 
threshold, and delivered to the motor cortex site used to determine the motor threshold, so 
as to minimize the potential for CNS-based startle reduction. We will then measure the 
effect of this stimulation on raw startle magnitude, and APS. Importantly, we will vary 
the duration between the TMS/sham pulses and the acoustic startle probe to identify the 
minimum pulse/probe interval needed to recover usable APS data. This minimum 
threshold, anticipated to be ~1 second, will be used in all future studies.  
 
General: As mentioned in “Study overview,” subjects in sub-studies 1 and 2 will 
participate in 2 outpatient visits (1 MRI visit and 1 TMS visit). where they will be 
assigned to one of two sub-studies (NPU or WM) for the TMS visit. Subjects in sub-
study 3 will participate in 3 outpatient visits (1 MRI visit and 2 TMS visits). Visits will 
be separated by ~1 week (no more than 2 weeks), according to the subject’s availability. 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page [ADDRESS_1003675] will complete the TMS safety 
screen (TASS). Subjects who do not meet the criteria for TMS will be withdrawn from 
the study at this time. Subjects participating in multiple sub-studies will complete the 
MRI visit only when participating in their first sub-study, unless the MRI visit needs to 
be repeated. Subjects in Sub-study [ADDRESS_1003676] will be given headphones for the white noise delivery. Subjects will undergo 
TMS motor threshold testing (during first TMS visit only for sub-study 3). Once the 
subject is prepped for the experiment, they will undergo startle habituation, and the shock 
workup. After the shock workup, subjects will complete the task while receiving TMS. 
Once the task is complete, the subject will complete retrospective questionnaires. For 
sub-studies [ADDRESS_1003677] will be assigned to one of two tasks (Sternberg WM or 
NPU). The TMS visit will be the same for subjects in both sub-studies with the exception 
of being assigned to one of the two tasks. For sub-study 3, subjects will participate in the 
NPU task pre and post TMS delivery, which will occur during a run of the Sternberg WM 
task (for active TMS targeting).  
 
Sub-study 1, Sternberg task: The session will begin with a startle habituation phase 
with 9 startle stimuli presented alone to reduce startle reactivity. On each WM trial, 
subjects will see a series of 4 letters presented singularly (encoding period) that will be 
followed by a brief interval where subjects are required to maintain these letters 
(maintenance period). At the end of the maintenance period, subjects will be prompted to 
make a response based on the task instructions (response period; Sternberg, 1966). The 
response prompt will consist of a letter and a number. The letter will be chosen from the 
study series, and the number will correspond to a position in the series. The subjects will 
indicate whether the positon of the letter in the series matches the number.  
 
There will be 4, 14 min runs of the experiment (2 active and 2 sham). Within each run, 
there will be 4 blocks (2 threat, 2 safe). During 1 block each of safe and threat, subjects 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 24 of 52 will receive a continuous train of 1 Hz stimulation to the left IPS. Within each block, 
there will be 2 types of trials based on the delivery of startle probes. On each trial a startle 
probe will be presented either during the maintenance period or the ITI. There will be 6 
trials per condition per block, resulting in a total of 192 trials across the entire experiment 
(2 [active vs. sham] x 2 [threat vs. safe] x 2 [maintenance vs. ITI] x 2 [TMS vs. no TMS] 
x 2 [run repetitions] x 2 [block repetitions] x 3 [trial repetitions]). Trials will last 
approximately 17 seconds. There will be a total of 3 shocks per run presented at random 
points during the threat blocks.  
 
Sub-study 2, NPU Task: The instructed fear paradigm that will be implemented uses 
administration of predictable and unpredictable shocks to generate phasic and sustained 
forms of potentiated startle. We will use the NPU threat procedure as described in 
(Schmitz and Grillon, 2012). The experiment consists of three different conditions: no 
shock (N), predictable shock (P), and unpredictable shock (U), each lasting 
approximately 150 sec. In the N condition, no shocks will be delivered. In the P 
condition, shocks will be administered predictably, that is, only in the presence of a threat 
cue. In the U condition, the shocks will be unpredictable. In each 150-sec condition, an 8-
sec cue will be presented four times. The cues will be different geometric colored shapes 
in each condition (e.g., a blue square for N, a red circle for P, and a green star for U) 
presented on a computer monitor in front of the subjects. The cue will signal the 
possibility of receiving a shock only in the P condition. It has no signal value in the N 
and U conditions. Instructions will also be displayed on a computer monitor to inform 
subjects of the nature of current condition by [CONTACT_734575]: “no shock” (N), “shock only during shape” (P), or 
“shock at any time” (U). During each predictable and unpredictable condition, one shock 
will be administered during the cue in the predictable condition and in the absence of a 
cue in the unpredictable condition.  
 
There will be 4, 14 min runs of the experiment (2 active and 2 sham). Within each run, 
there will be 8 blocks (2 predictable, 2 unpredictable, 4 neutral). There are twice the 
number of neutral blocks to ensure that safe blocks alternate with threat (predictable or 
unpredictable) blocks. During half of the blocks (1 predictible, 1 unpredictable, 2 
neutral), subjects will receive a continuous train of 1 Hz stimulation to the left IPS.  
Within each block, there will be 2 types of trials based on the delivery of startle probes. 
Startle probes will be presented either during the cue period, or the ITI. During the 
predictable and unpredictable blocks, there will be 4 trials per condition. Given that there 
will be twice as many neutral blocks, during these blocks there will only be 1 trial per 
condition. The result will be a total of 192 trials across the entire experiment (2 [active 
vs. sham] x 2 [neutral vs. predictable vs. unpredictable] x 2 [maintenance vs. ITI] x 2 
[TMS vs. no TMS] x 2 [run repetitions] x 4 [block*trial repetitions]). Trials will last 
approximately 17 seconds. There will be a total of 3 shocks per run presented during 
either the ITI (unpredictable) or cue (predictable) periods.  
 
Sub-study 3, NPU task: There will be [ADDRESS_1003678]-TMS NPU run during each 
TMS visit. Within each run, there will be 8 blocks (2 predictable, 2 unpredictable, 4 
neutral). There are twice the number of neutral blocks to ensure that safe blocks alternate 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 25 of 52 with threat (predictable or unpredictable) blocks. Startle probes will be presented either 
during the cue period, or the ITI. During the predictable and unpredictable blocks, there 
will be 2 trials per condition. Given that there will be twice as many neutral blocks, 
during these blocks there will only be 1 trial per condition. The result will be a total of 
192 trials across the entire experiment (2 [active vs. sham] x 3 [neutral vs. predictable vs. 
unpredictable] x 2 [maintenance vs. ITI] x 2 [pre-TMS vs. post-TMS] x 8 [block*trial 
repetitions]). There will be a total of 3 shocks per run presented during either the ITI 
(unpredictable) or cue (predictable) periods.  
TMS motor threshold testing: The resting motor threshold (MT) will be determined in 
order to find the safe TMS dosing level.  MT is defined as the minimum magnetic flux 
needed to elicit a threshold EMG response in a target muscle in [ADDRESS_1003679] dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle will be measured with 
EMG.  The scalp region producing the largest amplitude MEP will be identified.  At that -to-peak 
amplitude in 10 trials at this site will be determined using a descending method of limits 
procedure.   
 
rTMS targeting: The TMS target will be individualized for each subject as the location 
of greatest fMRI activation in the DLPFC found in the MRI session in response to the 
Sternberg task.  The fMRI image contrasting responses to high and low set sizes will be 
overlaid on the subject’s structural MRI, and the location in the DLPFC that most 
activated in that contrast will be chosen as the target for TMS. We will follow the method 
developed in Herwig et al. (2003): after initial processing, voxel-wise analysis will be 
performed.  In the right DLPFC, voxels of which effects survive p values of < 0.[ADDRESS_1003680] will be accepted when found in clusters of 50 or more.  Continuing to follow 
Herwig et al., when DLPFC contains greater than one cluster with higher activity, the 
region chosen will be based on a more conservative analysis adjusting the threshold 
upwards until only one cluster remains.  Conversely, when no clusters appear in DLPFC 
at more conservative significance levels, the threshold will be adjusted downwards until 
one cluster appears. It should be noted that this liberal thresholding procedure is being used for localization of activation only, and is not a statistically rigorous method of 
correction. Further, if no cluster emerges at a z=1.5 (p<.05) level, the coordinates for the 
significant activation in DLPFC for this contrast in the published group data will be 
substituted. To identify the target of stimulation for the left IPS, the same approach will 
be applied. However, rather than using the task-based data, we will calculate global brain 
connectivity from the resting state data, and extract the IPS location with the greatest 
global brain connectivity. TMS coil placement will be performed using Brainsight 
(Rogue Research, Inc., Montreal Canada), a frameless stereotaxic system for
neuronavigation, which can co-register scalp positions directly onto the individual’s 
structural MRI scan (with fMRI scan overlaid).  This system offers real-time three-
dimensional display of cortical localization as the TMS coil is moved across the scalp, 
and permits the targeting of individual sites of activation found by [CONTACT_734576].
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 26 of 52 TMS: Subjects will be brought to the Noninvasive Neuromodulation Unit Laboratory 
(Building 10, room 7-5485) for the experimental sessions.  They will be seated 
comfortably in a padded chair designed for TMS procedures, and hearing protection will 
be worn.  A Magventure MagPro 100 stimulator will be used.  A Figure 8 TMS coil will 
be placed on the head over the targeted cortical location, and trains of rTMS.  rTMS 
intensity will be 100% of the individual's EMG-determined resting motor threshold, 
adjusted for scalp-to-cortex distances at motor cortex and target cortex using the subject's 
T1. For online targeting, a continuous train of 1 Hz stimulation will be applied on a per 
block basis according to the design of each experiment. 1 Hz was chosen  because rTMS 
at frequencies below 1 Hz tends to decrease local excitability (Di Lazzaro et al., 2011). 
For  offline targeting, [ADDRESS_1003681] during the Sternberg WM paradigm, which should engage the target dlPFC circuits, 
thus increasing the efficacy of the TMS. 10 Hz was chosen because it is a frequency often 
used in offline stimulation protocols used to treat depression (Horvath et al., 2010; 
O’Reardon et al., 2007; Shajahan et al., 2002; Stern et al., 2007) . For sham 
stimulation, we will use a placebo coil with the exact same characteristics as the active 
coil. However, the placebo coil will have a magnetic shield that will provide a field 
reduction of ~80%, and the coil has an integrated e-stim for delivering small current 
pulse synchronous to the TMS pulse. The e-stim placebo coil administers a brief electric 
pulse to the scalp to replicate the current induced by [CONTACT_734577]. Importantly, the current generated by [CONTACT_941] e-stim placebo coil is similar in 
magnitude, duration, and distribution to the current induced by [CONTACT_28911] (Borckardt 
et al., 2008; Gonz et al., 2011; Rossi et al., 2007; Sheffer et al., 2013). In addition, 
although electrically and magnetically stimulated blinks differ in topology from 
acoustically generated blinks, they are nearly identical to each other in that respect 
(Blumenthal et al., 2005). 
 
Startle Reflex:  The acoustic startle stimuli will be a 40-ms burst of white noise (103 dB) 
with instantaneous rise time. Auditory stimuli will be delivered binaurally via 
headphones. The eyeblink component of the startle response will be measured by 
[CONTACT_83662] (EMG) activity of the left orbicularis oculi muscle as we 
have done in all of our previous psychopharmacology studies.  
 
Electric Shock: Electric shocks will be delivered through two tin disk electrodes located 
on the median nerve of the right wrist with a current constant stimulator. During the TMS 
visit prior to the experiment, the subject will undergo a shock workup procedure to 
identify an appropriate shock level. During the workup, subjects will receive brief (100 
ms) presentations of the shock starting at a low level (2 mA), which will be increased in 
intensity gradually, until it reaches a level that they rate as uncomfortable but tolerable. 
Shocks will be administered at that level during the experiment. The subject will also be 
informed that they are free to withdraw from the experiment if they later determine that 
the shock level is too high.  
 
Autonomic measures:  In addition to the acoustic startle reflex, we will also record the 
heart rate and the skin conductance for exploratory purposes. These measures will not

page [ADDRESS_1003682] and the armpit. The skin 
conductance will be measured using two (Ag-AgCl) electrodes in conjunction with a 
.05M NaCl electrolyte. Electrodes will be placed on the distal phalange of the index and 
second finger of the left hand. These measures will not add discomfort to the subjects.
Self-report Questionnaires:  Subjects will be asked to fill out self-report questionnaires 
during the experiments (i.e. TMS adult safety screen (Keel et al., 2000), the State Anxiety 
Scale (S-Anxiety)(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996], 1987), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck et al., 1988), 
Retrospective Threat Questionnaire). During the TMS visit, subjects will be asked to 
retrospectively rate their fear and anxiety levels using an analog scale during each 
condition (Retrospective Threat Questionnaire). Retrospective measures of fear and 
anxiety will be collected on an analog scale ranging from 0 (not at all anxious) to 10 
(extremely anxious).  This analog scale has been a reliable measure of anxiety in our past 
studies. The State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety) (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996], 1987) a 20-item self-
administered rating scale with measures of mood.  The non-analog measures from these 
reports may be completed by [CONTACT_734578] (CTSS) 
online system. AIs may then collect data from the Clinical Trials Database (CTDB) for 
the purposes of this study.  Subjects may enter their responses while at NIH using a 
wireless-device interface to access the NIH-intranet secure CTDB. There are no 
actionable items with use of CTSS requiring real-time monitoring. 
 
Urine Tests: Participants will also undergo a urine pregnancy prior to the visits.  
e. End of participation 
Participants may be discharged after the end of the procedures. Adverse effects will be 
followed up by [CONTACT_734579].   
Individual research results are not shared with the participants. Medical information will 
be shared with the primary provider upon request if there are abnormal findings upon 
physical exam, brain scan, or from laboratory findings.  
5. Management of Data and Samples 
a. Storage 
All electronic records will be kept confidential according to NIH Clinical Center’s 
standard policies.. Participants’ names and other personal identifying information will be 
stored in electronically secured databases at the study sites.  These databases are 
password protected and only study personnel will be given a password.  Results will be 
published as group data without the use of characteristics that would identify individual 
subjects.  No biological samples will be collected.  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page [ADDRESS_1003683] to the Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy. Data may also 
be shared with collaborating laboratories at NIH or outside of NIH and/or submitted to 
NIH-designated repositories and databases if consent for sharing was obtained.
Repositories receiving data and/or samples from this protocol may be open-access or 
restricted access.  
 
Samples and data will be stripped of identifiers and may be coded (“de-identified”) or 
unlinked from an identifying code (“anonymized”). When coded data is shared, the key 
to the code will not be provided to collaborators, but will remain at NIH.  Data and 
samples may be shared with investigators and institutions with an FWA or operating 
under the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH) and reported at the time of continuing review.  
Sharing with investigators without an FWA or not operating under the DoH will be 
submitted for prospective IRB approval. Submissions to NIH-sponsored or supported 
databases and repositories will be reported at the time of Continuing Review.  
Submission to non-NIH sponsored or supported databases and repositories will be 
submitted for prospective IRB approval. 
 
Required approvals from the collaborating institution will be obtained and materials will 
be shipped in accordance with NIH and federal regulations.    
 
6. Additional Considerations  
No additional considerations are applicable.

Not applicable.  
7. Risks and Discomforts 
a. Procedures 
Questionnaires: There is minimal medical risk in completing the questionnaires. Some 
of the questions may make the participants feel uncomfortable or anxious. Participants 
may refuse to answer any question or to stop a test at any time and for any reason.
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 29 of 52 Psychophysiological recording : The psychophysiological measures that will be obtained 
are non-invasive, requiring the administration of no needles, drugs, or dyes. Little 
discomfort is expected. During electrode placement, the possibility of skin irritation from 
contact [CONTACT_28924]. However, this is unlikely as the salt 
concentration of the paste is similar to that of human sweat. The risk is equivalent to that 
of an EEG recording. 
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_12866]: We will offer a topi[INVESTIGATOR_734543]. This may cause skin redness, swelling, or skin irritation. These symptoms 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_734544].  
 
Electric shock : The shocks will be delivered through two disk electrodes located on the 
subject’s left wrist. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_28890]. The shock is generally 
described by [CONTACT_28925]. The mean rating of aversiveness 
on a scale of 1 (not painful at all) to 10 (extremely painful) is about 5. Over 95% of 
subjects who experienced the shock chose to participate in the experiment.  
 
In very rare occasions, subjects have experienced symptoms that may be related to the 
shock. A participant with a condition called “cubital tunnel syndrome,” a repetitive 
motion injury similar to carpal tunnel syndrome, indicated worsening of his syndrome 
over the months subsequent to his participation. Another participant reported pain in her 
arms for several hours after testing. The pain was no longer present the next day. It is 
unclear whether these symptoms were due to the shocks. Nevertheless, subjects with 
neurological symptoms of the wrist and arms will be excluded from the study.  
 
Auditory startle stimulus:  The auditory stimuli that will be used in the startle studies are 
40-ms duration 102 dB white noise. Auditory startling sounds of much higher intensities 
are frequently used in startle studies. Sounds of higher intensities and longer duration are 
also widely used in aversive conditioning in human subjects, where they serve as 
unconditioned stimuli. The short duration (40 ms) of these sounds makes them safe (i.e., 
there is no danger of hearing impairment). In addition, a white noise is safer than a pure 
tone. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_28889] 1000 
of subjects with no adverse reactions. The auditory stimulus may trigger a migraine. 
TMS:  In 2008, the FDA approved the use of high frequency rTMS in the treatment of 
depression. In 2009, a safety guideline was published whereupon the authors 
systematically reviewed the thousands of healthy subjects and patients who have 
undergone rTMS in order to allow better assessment of relative risk (Rossi et al., 2009). 
The relative infrequency of adverse events using rTMS was noted include the rTMS 
intensity and timing parameters considered safe, training, and planning for and managing 
emergencies.  We will follow these guidelines, and have incorporated them into our 
screening and session procedures. 
Although there are no known long-term health risks to the use of TMS when operated 
within consensus safety guidelines (Rossi et al., 2009), the greatest potential short-term 
risk in the use of TMS is seizure. The Rossi et al. (2009) consensus safety report stated 
that “the occurrence of seizures has been extremely rare, with most of the few new cases 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 30 of 52 receiving TMS protocols exceeding previous guidelines, often in patients under treatment 
with drugs which potentially lowered the seizure threshold.”  As Rossi et al. delineate, 
“rare” means that up to the end of 2008, [ADDRESS_1003684] closely 
associated with seizure risk. While high frequency TMS will be employed in this protocol 
(5 Hz rTMS), the parameters to be used are well within suggested safety limits. 
Aside from seizure, other adverse effects of TMS include headache, vasovagal syncope 
and hearing effects. Stimulation over superficial scalp tissue can result in headaches, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_223282] a muscle-tension type, and local muscle aches, especially with high-
frequency TMS.  They usually develop during or immediately after the stimulation, may 
last for minutes to hours following the end of the stimulation, and usually respond 
promptly to single doses of over the counter pain medications.  Cramped conditions 
extended in time within frameless stereotaxic apparatus can also lead to head and body 
aches.  Both are usually managed easily with over-the-counter analgesics. The sensation 
of the TMS pulses on the scalp can trigger vasovagal syncope (i.e. fainting) in some 
individuals, but these epi[INVESTIGATOR_734545]-up (Gillick et 
al., 2015; Kesar et al., 2016; Riedel et al., 2016). In addition, hearing loss and tinnitus 
may result from TMS.  The clicking sound made by [CONTACT_734581], but this is deceptive: subjective loudness is a function of both 
sound intensity and duration, and the duration of a TMS pulse is less than a millisecond. 
The sound intensity can be quite high, exceeding 100 dB and federally-recommended 
safety levels. It has been recommended that all participants wear ear protection with TMS 
exposure (Rossi et al., 2009).  
 
MRI: MRI is widely regarded as a safe, noninvasive procedure for visualization of brain 
tissue. The risks involved with fMRI are the same as those involved in standard anatomic 
MRI, since these three procedures rely on the same physical properties of brain tissue. 
This study will be performed on an FDA approved 3T scanner at the NIMH. Potential 
risk of heart rhythm disturbances exists for patients with a history of heart rhythm 
abnormalities or those who have certain types of pacemakers. A substantial risk to 
persons who have metallic objects inside their bodies exists, as the magnet in the scanner 
can cause these to move. Pregnant women should not undergo MRI because of the 
possible harmful effects to the fetus.  
 
MRI at [ADDRESS_1003685] access to a panic 
button at all times and can press this to stop the scan and be removed from the scanner.   
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page 31 of 52 b. Procedures to Minimize Risks
Electric Shock:  Shock will be delivered at a level that is judged by [CONTACT_734582]. Study shock levels will be determined before the test begins. 
The subject may stop the experiment at any time if they find the discomfort to be too 
great. 
 
TMS: Seizure is a theoretical risk with rTMS.  In the Rossi et al. report it was stated that: 
“The occurrence of seizures has been extremely rare, with most of the few new cases 
receiving rTMS protocols exceeding previous guidelines, often in patients under 
treatment with drugs which potentially lowered the seizure threshold.”  As Rossi et al. 
delineate, “rare” means that 16 cases (out of tens of thousands of rTMS sessions over the 
last two decades) of seizure related to rTMS have been reported.  Eight occurred before 
safety parameters were established in 1997.  Of the other eight reports, six occurred either 
when the safe rTMS parameters were exceeded or other safety guidelines ignored, and 
the actual occurrence of a seizure has been questioned in the other two (i.e., convulsive 
syncope or pseudoseizure may have occurred).  In a workshop convened by [CONTACT_734583] (NINDS) in 1996 (including the PI [CONTACT_180376], 
[CONTACT_442448], and one of the investigators, [CONTACT_442447]), researchers in the field agreed upon 
a set of rTMS consensus safety guideline s, including recommended stimulation 
parameters and contra-indications (Wasserman, 1998), and these consensus guidelines 
have been updated (Rossi et al., 2009). Widespread adherence to the 1996 guidelines has 
resulted in the virtual elimination of inadvertent seizures in rTMS studies (Rossi et al., 
2009).  The levels of stimulation used in this protocol are well within safety guidelines
(Rossi et al., 2009; Wasserman, 1998).   
 
We will screen subjects for known risk factors for seizure with rTMS (using the TASS
questionnaire) after consent during the MRI visit (Keel et al., 2000). Personnel who 
administer rTMS are trained to recognize a potential seizure event and to act as “first 
responders” in order to administer appropriate initial care. All study personnel have 
undergone first-aid and CPR training, and seizure-specific training. The major physical 
signs the study personnel will look out for in detecting a potential seizure include 
chewing movements, convulsions/tremor/shaking, difficulty talking, a blank stare, eyes 
rolling up, and profuse sweating. If any of these signs are observed, study personnel will 
stop the research procedure and inquire whether the subject feels okay. If the subject is 
unresponsive (and therefore likely experiencing a seizure), first-aid will be supplied. The 
first-aid response consists of making sure the subject is physically safe for the duration of 
the seizure. This involves moving the subjects out of the TMS chair and onto the floor 
lying down on his or her left side. The subject will be kept lying down on his or her left 
side, while the staff call call a code blue, as per NIH Clinical Center policy. Resources 
available in the laboratory include a first-aid kit and immediate phone access.  A seizure 
constitutes a reportable adverse event, and will thus be immediately reported to the IRB 
via the Safety Events Form mechanism. 
 
The most commonly reported side effect of rTMS is headache.  This headache is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_223282] a muscle-tension type. It usually develops during or immediately after the 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page [ADDRESS_1003686] aid by [CONTACT_5984], and evaluated by [CONTACT_734584].  
 
As noted in Rossi et al. (2009), Loo and colleagues reported found mild and transient 
changes in auditory threshold in two depressed patients following a 2-4 week rTMS 
course of rTMS (Loo et al., 2001). Cases of tinnitus have been reported after rTMS 
treatments. In addition, recently in a study investigating the effects of rTMS on 
symptoms of depression, a patient experienced moderate to severe tinnitus after an rTMS 
session in which hearing protection was not used.  Rossi et al. recommended that hearing 
protection always should be worn during rTMS application, and that individuals with 
cochlear implants not receive rTMS.  Hearing protection will be worn by [CONTACT_734585]. Individuals with cochlear implants will be excluded from 
participation. 
 
Risks to the unborn children of pregnant women receiving MRI and TMS are unknown.  
Pregnant women will be excluded as per CC policy.  
 
MRI:  The potential risks related to MRI will be minimized as follows: 1) 
Claustrophobia associated with MRI will be reduced by [CONTACT_734586]; and 2) a possible history of any 
intraocular, intra-aural, intracranial, or intrathoracic metal will exclude the subject from 
the study. Earplugs will be given to each subject to wear during the scan to minimize 
discomfort and prevent any adverse effects on hearing resulting from the scanning 
procedure. Females of childbearing potential will undergo either serum or urine 
pregnancy testing to rule out pregnancy no more than [ADDRESS_1003687] (or trained 
individual authorized to run the scanner) and a clinician will be present throughout the 
MRI study in case medical emergencies would arise. During MRI scanning, the subject 
can communicate with the control room personnel via an intercom at the operating 
console. Thus, the subject can be removed immediately from the MRI scanner, if 
necessary. 
 
 
8. Subject Safety Monitoring

page [ADDRESS_1003688] who exhibits signs of distress during any 
phase of the study. Subjects will be constantly monitored via closed circuit video by [CONTACT_734587]. An AI is present during TMS sessions. A credentialed staff member 
(RN, NP or MD) will assess the subject at the conclusion of the study or at any time if 
significant side effects develop.  The subject will be withdrawn at any time if unable to 
follow the rules for participation in this study.  
 
9. Outcome Measures 
a. Primary outcome measures 
The primary outcome measures will be APS reduction as a function of stimulation type, 
active or sham stimulation.  
 
10. Statistical Analysis 
a. Analysis of data/ study outcomes 
Sternberg. APS scores will created by [CONTACT_734588]. These scores will be analyzed 
using a 2 [block: active vs. sham] x 2 [stimulation: TMS vs. no TMS] x 2 [interval: 
maintenance vs. ITI] repeated measures ANOVA.  
 
NPU.  APS scores for the cue and ITI will be created by [CONTACT_734589]. FPS 
scores will be calculated by [CONTACT_734590]. These scores (APS cue, APS ITI, 
FPS cue) will be analyzed using a 2 [block: active vs. sham] x 2 [stimulation: TMS vs. no 
TMS] repeated measures ANOVA.  
 
b. Power analysis  
In our Sternberg pi[INVESTIGATOR_255952], we obtained the effect size (f=0.72) for our observed 
WM load-related decrease in anxiety. Assuming a somewhat smaller effect size (f=0.5) 
due to regression to the mean, if we set power at .95 and experiment-wise, two-tailed 
alpha at 0.05. Based on these parameters, we will need 48 subjects per experiment. 
Assuming a 15% unusable data rate and [ADDRESS_1003689] the experimental 
procedure, we will need 58 subjects per experiment.  
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page [ADDRESS_1003690] be able to provide their own consent. This study is above minimal risk 
and we do not want to enroll participants who do not understand the risk/benefit ratio of 
the study, particularly when there is no benefit to the participants.   
For this reason we exclude people with IQ lower than 80, or otherwise deemed to lack 
capacity to consent.  
 
Protections for employees and staff participating in this study include 1) assuring that the 
participation or refusal to participate will have no effect, either beneficial or adverse, on 
the subject’s employment or position at the NIH, 2) giving employees and staff who are 
interested in participating the “NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research 
Participation” prior to obtaining consent, and 3) assuring that there will be no direct 
solicitation of employees or staff. This study collects sensitive information (e.g. drug and 
alcohol use, specific medical diagnoses). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_734546]-workers through staff 
discussions and written branch/section procedures.  Information about sensitive 
information (e.g. drug and alcohol use, specific medical diagnoses) will be in the 
participant’s NIH medical record. 
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14)

translated and validated in Spanish or other languages. 
Justification for exclusion of subjects over 50 years of aged 
As people get older, their startle response decreases (Le Duc et al., 2016). The upper age 
limit will be [ADDRESS_1003692] that such 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14) 
page [ADDRESS_1003693] been very well tolerated by 100’s of past participants in our 
psychophysiology experiments, we decided to again use electric shocks in our 
neuroimaging investigations described herein. TMS will be used to stimulate the dlPFC. 
According to our previous research, this should reduce anxiety potentiated startle. We 
chose TMS because it allows us to stimulate the dlPFC online, during the task, which is 
not possible with other methods like tDCS.  
Safeguards for vulnerable populations and sensitive procedures 
We assess pregnancy via urine test within [ADDRESS_1003694], either beneficial or adverse, on the participant’s employment 
or position at NIH. The NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research Participation will 
be available to employees considering enrollment. All staff administering sensitive 
procedures will be trained and competency to administer procedures verified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_734547].

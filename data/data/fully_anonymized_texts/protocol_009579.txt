  1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
GENERAL INFORMATION  
STUDY TITLE An Evaluation of the Safety and Effectiveness of the N-SWEAT Patch 
for the Treatment of Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis or Excessive 
Axillary Sweating  
INVESTIGATIONAL 
DEVICE N-SWEAT Patch 
STUDY NAME  [CONTACT_640152]  A non-invasive energy-based patch, which, when in contact [CONTACT_640085], produces thermal energy intended to target and temporarily 
inactivate sweat glands leading to a reduction in sweat production  
 Patch is self-adhesive with a layer of alkali metal foil pressed into a 
polyimide film 
 Device is inert until it comes into contact [CONTACT_50641] (sweat) 
 Patch is applied to the axillae for up to 3-minutes in a medical office, 
it is then removed and disposed of by [CONTACT_131459].    
CONTROL DEVICE  Sham Patch  
SPONSOR/ 
MANUFACTURER  Candesant Biomedical, Inc 
INDICATION FOR 
USE (proposed) N-SWEAT Patch is indicated for treatment of excessive axillary 
sweating or primary axillary hyperhidrosis in individuals 22 years of 
age or older.   
REGULATORY 
STATUS  The N-SWEAT Patch is under clinical investigation in the US for this 
proposed indication  
 
STUDY OVERVIEW  
DESIGN  Prospective, multi -center, randomized, blind ed, sham-controlled  
OBJECTIVE The pi[INVESTIGATOR_640055] N-SWEAT Patch for use in subjects with excessive axillary sweating 
or primary focal axillary hyperhidrosis.  
Safety of the N-SWEAT Patch will be confirmed by [CONTACT_640086], treatment-related adverse events 
(AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).   
Primary demonstration of effectiveness will be assessed by a significant 
improvement (reduction) in Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score 
(HDSS) in subjects treated with the N-SWEAT Patch versus sham 
control subjects.  Secondary and additional endpoints based on 
complementary clinical instruments have been included to further 
demonstrate performance .   
POPULATION Healthy male and female subjects in good general health who sweat 
excessively in the axillae or have primary focal axillary hyperhidrosis will 
be considered for study participation.  Enrollment is limited to subjects 
with HDSS scores of 3 or 4.   
STUDY DURATION ROLL-IN COHORT: 1.5 months enrollment / 3.5 months follow-up 
RANDOMIZED COHORT:  3 months enrollment / 3.5 months follow -up

  TREATMENT APPROACH  
Note: There is no difference in the treatment approach for the test vs. control groups.   In the 
randomized cohort p ersonnel are blinded to treatment assignments   
INSPECTION Final examination of the axilla to confirm freedom from any skin disease or 
irritation, including both visual and tactile assessment of any irregularities. 
Axilla must be free of abrasions, broken skin, or other conditions of concern.  
If both axilla e do not meet th is requirement, do not proceed with treatment .   
IDENTIFICATION 
OF TREATMENT 
SITE The target treatment area should be chosen by [CONTACT_68108] a relatively flat 
area with the highest concentration of hair follicles; intended to maximize 
contact [CONTACT_640090].  For convenience, site may be 
marked.   
PREP OF 
TREATMENT 
SITE The subject’s axilla (treatment site) will be cleaned with alcohol to ensure 
that no residual deodorant or other residue remains in the target treatment 
area.  The area shall then be thoroughly dried.  
PATCH 
APPLICATION The clinician removes the release liner and applies the patch to the prepared 
and dried axillary area.  The patch is held in place by [CONTACT_640091], which is no longer than  3-minutes.  
Throughout the treatment period the clinician will observe the subject closely.  
If the subject experiences discomfort or pain that is significant (8 or greater 
pain level on a Wong-Baker FACES pain scale) the patch should be 
removed immediately  even if it has been in place for less than [ADDRESS_856523] 
does not feel any residual effects.  The patch should be placed into the 
disposal solution per instructions provided .   
SECOND 
AXILLA All the sequential steps above will be repeated for treatment of the second 
axilla in the same treatment visit.   
 
RANDOMIZATION  
RANDOMIZATION Subjects in the randomized cohort will be randomized to one of two 
treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single administration of N-
SWEAT Patch or sham control patch in both axillae. The randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_640087] 3 vs. 4 at baseline.  
BLINDING  Subjects in the randomized cohort will remain blinded to their 
treatment assignment  
 Site personnel conduction follow-up evaluations will be kept blinded 
 The treatment assignments will not be shared with the study sites; the 
sponsor will provide devices accurately labeled to allocate treatment 
assignments 
 The sponsor will identify only those who need to be unblinded to 
conduct the study, all others at the sponsor will remain blinded 
 The statistician conducting the data analysis; a different statistician 
responsible for the randomization codes will be unblinded to the 
treatment assignment s.

SAFETY ANALYSIS Adverse Events summaries will be presented overall, by [CONTACT_926], by 
[CONTACT_640092] (defined as related or 
with missing relationship). The SAE’s will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. Evaluation of local skin reactions will also be tabulated.  
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_11364]. 
Patient listings of SAEs and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be 
presented.  Adverse device events, serious adverse device events and 
unanticipated adverse device events will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490].   
The occurrence of local skin reactions, device-related AEs, and SAEs will 
be assessed to confirm device safety.  This safety analysis will include all 
enrolled subjects (both Roll -in and Randomized Cohorts).

  3. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND   
  
3.1 The Population: 
One-third of adults in the [LOCATION_002] believe they sweat too much under their arms 
according to the International Hyperhidrosis Society (IHHS), (Glaser 2018).  Based on 
the [ADDRESS_856531] a clinical diagnosis of hyperhidrosis. 
People with primary hyperhidrosis generally sweat from a certain type of sweat gland 
called eccrine sweat glands (Strutton 2004, Hornberger 2004).   These sweat glands 
make up the majority of the 2-4 million sweat glands in the human body. Eccrine sweat 
glands are particularly numerous on the feet, palms, face, and armpit. The prevalence 
of the condition of hyperhidrosis is reported to be 4.8% in the [LOCATION_002] (15.3 million 
people). Hyperhidrosis is most prevalent in the age 18-39 group (8.8%) and axillae as 
the most commonly affected area (65%) (Doolittle 2016). Those who sweat excessively 
report a significant negative impact on quality of life ranging from bothersome to 
debilitating (Wade 2017, Hamm 2014).   
Evidence suggests that the disease of hyperhidrosis is both underreported and 
underdiagnosed.  Data indicate that only about 50% of hyperhidrotic patients discuss 
their sweating with a physician and, ultimately, only 27% of actual sufferers will be 
diagnosed with the condition.  Many believe that their sweating does not equate to a 
medical condition and/or that there that there is nothing that can be done to reduce their 
sweating (Doolittle, 2016). Thus, there is a large population of patients with excessive 
axillary sweating that could potentially benefit from treatment but have not been 
diagnosed with primary axillary hyperhidrosis.   
This Sahara study is therefore designed to reach all patients with excessive axillary 
sweating regardless of a diagnosis.  Subject will be required to have a Hyperhidrosis 
Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) Score of [ADDRESS_856532] appropriate to confirm 
the safety and understand the efficacy of the N-SWEAT Patch for the reduction of 
axillary sweating.   
3.2    The Unmet Need: 
Currently, the first line of treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis is over-the-counter 
antiperspi[INVESTIGATOR_265979], while effective for normal sweaters, do not provide an adequate solution 
for most sufferers and are often irritating.  Off-label administration of oral anticholinergic 
medications and topi[INVESTIGATOR_640061]. Currently available in-office 
procedures (including botulinum toxin injections and use of microwave energy), 
although effective, can be painful and prohibitively expensive.  Moreover, a 2016 IHHS 
survey showed that even though 87.2% of the 1,985 survey participants had received 
some form of treatment for their excessive sweating, satisfaction with the treatments 
received a mean score of “below satisfied” (Glaser 2018).   Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_640062] #: CB-CLP-001 
Revision: E 
 
 
 
Version E                                                           Confidential                                                Page 13 of 78 
  currently effective treatments to reduce sweating, there remains a need for additional 
options to help patients reduce axillary sweating for these patients with an approach 
that is easy to administer with minimal side effects.   
To this end, Candesant Biomedical has developed the CDX-101 Patch, which has been 
renamed the N-SWEAT Patch.  This is a non-invasive topi[INVESTIGATOR_640063].  The patch is 
applied in a physician’s office to the axillae for up to 3-minutes.  During treatment, the 
patch will generate thermal energy in the presence of sweat and is designed to target 
the sweat glands for inactivation. After this treatment, the patch is completely removed 
and disposed of by [CONTACT_131459].    
3.3   Early Evidence for N-SWEAT Patch:  
The N-SWEAT patch (previously called the CDX-101 Patch) was studied in a feasibility 
study in which 12 subjects (both axillae) were successfully treated; 4 of these subjects 
received an optional (both axillae) retreatment procedure after the initial study period.  
Thus, a total of 32 Patches were used during this study: 24 in the initial treatments and 
8 during the retreatments.  Technical feasibility of heat generation was demonstrated 
across all treatments. The safety endpoint of the study was also met in all patients.  
There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the study.  Only two (2) 
device related adverse events were reported; both were deemed mild.  Efficacy as 
measured by a 1-point improvement in HDSS was observed in 91% (11/12) subjects, 
64% of the subjects achieved HDSS scores of 1 or 2 at the end of the evaluation period 
(6-weeks).   Mean gravimetric sweat production was reduced an average of 68% across 
the 6-week follow-up period. QoL survey results showed a consistent trend with the 
majority of subjects reporting improvement across all measures.  Device tolerability was 
confirmed with all subjects reporting an acceptable level of pain during the procedure.   
The outcomes of the STAYDRI.1 Study led the company to the decision to initiate a pi[INVESTIGATOR_395965] a control group (STAYDRI.A).  STAYDRI.A was a prospective, randomized, 
controlled, double-blinded pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], conducted under IRB approval with a non-
significant risk designation.  Sixteen (16) subjects were successfully randomized (1:1) 
and treated bilaterally, with both axillae receiving the same treatment; 8 subjects (16 
axillae) with the N-SWEAT patch and 8 subjects (16 axillae) with the sham patch. 
Subjects and evaluating clinicians were blinded to the assigned treatment. The device 
was shown to be safe with only one (1) device-related AE observed in the N-SWEAT 
treatment group; the AE was deemed moderate and resolved without sequelae.  There 
were no serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the study.  The efficacy 
endpoints of the study were also successful.  Subjects treated with the N-SWEAT patch 
demonstrated consistent and sustained improvement in HDSS and additional QoL 
measurements.  A post hoc analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference in 
subjects with a 2-point improvement in HDSS between the treated and sham groups, 
67% vs 0% respectively at 4-weeks (p=0.0123).  Further, 83% of treated subjects 
reported a HDSS score of 1 or 2 at 4-weeks versus 0% in the sham control (p=0.0032).  
Moreover, improvements in both level of “bother” and “impact on daily living” were 
sustained throughout the study with the difference in QoL scores between the treated 
and sham groups increasing over the follow-up period.  Finally, at the end of the study

  (6-weeks) 66.7% of N-SWEAT treated subjects demonstrated a reduction in GSP that 
was ≥50%.  Interestingly, subjects treated with the sham also exhibited a reduction in 
GSP (mean 44% / median 46%/ ≥50% reduction 14%).  It is important to note that 
subjects treated with the sham did not have corresponding improvements in the QoL 
assessments as measured by [CONTACT_640095].  This 
finding, while on the surface contradictory, is consistent with recent published reports 
that gravimetric sweat production may not be clinically meaningful in determining the 
level of disease.    
 
By [CONTACT_640096], the N-SWEAT device has demonstrated a favorable safety profile. 
No SAEs have been reported to date. Three (3) total device-related events that 
occurred in this cumulative data set (2 mild and 1 moderate) were all skin reactions that 
were treated topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], and all resolved without sequalae. Moreover, data on the 
subjects’ condition after treatment including HDSS and QoL assessments are also 
consistent; subjects largely feel like their condition is improved. 
These findings establish acute safety and suggest effectiveness sufficiently to warrant 
the initiation of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]; the SAHARA Study is intended to confirm safety and 
further demonstrate efficacy of the N-SWEAT Patch in a larger multi-center 
representative population.

  4. N-SWEAT PATCH INFORMATION 
 
4.1   Indications For Use  
N-SWEAT Patch is indicated for treatment of excessive axillary sweating or primary 
axillary hyperhidrosis in individuals 22 years of age or older.   
The N-SWEAT Patch requires a prescription. 
4.2     Description of the N-SWEAT Patch 
The N-SWEAT Patch consists of three (3) layers (Figure 1): a thin layer of alkali metal 
foil (active), an adhesive backing (which helps the patch stay in place during treatment) 
and a protective barrier layer.  The barrier layer protects the patch during storage and is 
removed and discarded immediately prior to the treatment.  The N-SWEAT Patch is 
single-use.   
Figure 1.  Diagram of the N-SWEAT Patch 
 
 
The device is provided non-sterile and is not intended to be sterilized. 
There are no accessories, software, or other equipment with the N-SWEAT Patch. 
4.[ADDRESS_856533] skin by [CONTACT_640097].  The patch is activated by [CONTACT_640098].  When sweat 
(comprised of up to 99% water, Wilke et al. 2007) comes into contact [CONTACT_39436], the 
sodium interacts with the water causing the patch to generate thermal energy.  The 
amount and precise location of heat produced depends on the amount and location of 
sweat with which the patch comes into contact.  In the absence of sweat (water), no 
thermal energy is generated.

  The patch is applied for up to 3 minutes.  Removal may occur prior to the 3-minute time 
point if the patient experiences pain or discomfort (as described in the Instructions for 
Use (IFU)).   
The duration of the effect of the N-SWEAT patch is expected to be 6-8 weeks on 
average although early clinical data showed some patients maintained reduced sweat at 
8-10 weeks. Duration time will be elucidated by [CONTACT_109563].   
The N-SWEAT Patch is an Investigational Device and is limited by [CONTACT_640099].

acceptable candidate for the Sahara Study.  If initial review indicates that the subject 
may be eligible, the subject may be approached regarding the study, and the informed 
consent process may commence.   
Once the subject has provided consent, a screening visit may be scheduled to conduct 
final screening assessments.  Note that requirements for cessation of other treatments 
may require a lead time for scheduling this visit.   
 
8.2    Active Screening  
Active study screening will begin at a screening visit.  Assessments conducted at this 
visit will include the following: 
 History and Demographics:   General inclusion and exclusion criteria review 
and health evaluation to ensure that the subject is not planning to undergo a 
surgical procedure during their expected participation in the study, is not actively 
participating in another clinical study that may confound the results of this study, 
and is willing to comply with the requirements should be conducted first.  Only 
after these qualifications are met; should the following 2 assessments (GSP and 
HDSS) be conducted.     
o NOTE:  If excessive hair is present on the axilla at the screening visit the 
hair shall be clipped or shaven during this visit prior to conducting 
assessments.  Stubble or minimal hair is acceptable.   
 GSP:  Gravimetric sweat production should be measured in accordance with 
instructions and training provided by [CONTACT_456] ( Appendix D ).  Any deviation 
from this procedure should be documented and explained.  In summary, 
measurements will be obtained following a period of rest in normal room 
temperature. Subjects will have a pre-weighed filter paper placed in each of their 
axillae for 5 minutes. The difference in the filter paper’s weight before and after 
will be considered the GSP measurement.   
o At the baseline, the GSP assessment is required to show at least 50 mg/5 
min of spontaneous resting axillary sweat production in each axilla and no 
more than 300 mg/5 min in either axilla.   
 HDSS: The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale should be explained to the 
subject in plain language and in accordance with the instructions and training 
provided by [CONTACT_456] ( Appendix A ).  It should be clear to the subject that they 
are answering these questions to report on their underarm sweating.  The subject 
will be asked to take this test weekly throughout the study via questionnaire that 
will be sent electronically by [CONTACT_442995], tablet, or computer.   
o At the baseline visit, Subject HDSS score be 3 or 4

   Pregnancy Test :  Women of child-bearing potential with no history of 
hysterectomy are required to have a negative pregnancy test and must be 
practicing and willing to continue using an effective method of birth control from 
screening visit until study completion.   
 Assessment for Local Skin Reactions :  The investigator will evaluate axillary 
application sites for any skin irritation. If present (greater than 1) based on the Skin 
Erythema Assessment and the Clinical Signs/Symptom Descriptors ( Appendix B ), 
the subject may only be treated once the issue has been resolved (less than or 
equal to 1).  
 
Once the subject has completed these initial assessments and has been deemed 
eligible, the subject will be scheduled to report back for baseline assessment and 
potential Treatment.  The baseline/treatment assessment must be scheduled at least 72 
hours after any hair removal. All subjects should be provided with clear instructions that 
no shaving or clippi[INVESTIGATOR_640068] 72 hours of the scheduled 
baseline/treatment visit.  The presence of stubble is acceptable.   
An approved deodorant (without antiperspi[INVESTIGATOR_640069]) will be provided to all eligible subjects at 
the conclusion of this visit; this deodorant should be used by [CONTACT_640102]. If the subject 
wishes to use a different deodorant; it must be approved by [CONTACT_456].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_856551] will report for baseline 
assessment and potential treatment. ( NOTE: If axillary hair was clipped at the 
screening visit, the baseline visit must be at least 72 hours later ).  All efforts should 
be taken to make sure that the subject is prepared to undergo treatment during this 
visit if they meet the eligibility requirements below.   
Baseline Assessments include:  
 GSP:  Gravimetric sweat production should be measured in accordance with the 
instructions and training provided by [CONTACT_456] ( Appendix D ).  Any deviation 
from this procedure should be documented and explained.   
o At baseline, subject GSP assessment is required to show at least 50 mg 
/5min of spontaneous resting axillary sweat production in each axilla and 
no more than 300 mg/5 min in either axilla.  The difference between 
screening and baseline for either axilla may not be >100%.   
 HDSS:  The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale should be explained to the 
subject in plain language and in accordance with the instructions and training 
provided by [CONTACT_456] ( Appendix A ).  It must be clear that these questions 
relate to underarm sweating.

equal to 1).  
o NOTE:  If abrasions or broken skin are present; the subject may report 
back for re-screening after the skin has had time to heal (at least 72 
hours).  Treatment in the study in the presence of skin irritations or 
abrasions can lead to increased probability of the patient experiencing 
discomfort, pain or skin irritations.    
o NOTE: The subject must meet the criteria above in both axilla since the 
study treatment includes treatment of both axillae in the same procedure.   
Once the subject has completed these assessments and has been deemed eligible, 
the subject can be treated as party of either the Roll-In Cohort or the Randomized 
Cohort and will be considered enrolled as described below.    All efforts should be 
taken for treatment to occur on the same day.  If the subject is not able to have 
treatment on the same day as the baseline visit and is in the Randomized Cohort, 
randomization should not take place.  Randomization should occur immediately 
before treatment.    
8.3.2 After Confirmation of Eligibility  
The Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires should be completed by [CONTACT_640103].  QOL surveys will include: QOL-7, which has a total 
of 7 questions, QOL (Bother and Impact) which has [ADDRESS_856552] should complete

Subjects in this cohort are enrolled once they undergo treatment with the N-SWEAT 
Patch.   
 
8.5 Randomization Cohort 
8.5.1 Randomization Process 
Note:  Randomization should take place immediately before treatment.  If a subject 
meets all eligibility criteria at the screening and baseline visits; but is unable or 
unwilling to undergo treatment.  Do not randomize.  The subject should report back 
for randomization at the time of their planned treatment.  If it is more than 7 days

  between the qualifying baseline visit and randomization; the HDSS and the physical 
exam should be repeated to confirm eligibility prior to Randomization.   
Randomization will be performed using an electronic system.  Upon entering the 
subject information, the electronic system will assign a unique treatment to the 
subject.  The subject must be treated with the assigned treatment number.  In the 
event that the site is prevented from using the assigned treatment number (either 
due to the patch being missing, damaged or otherwise unusable) the site must 
contact [CONTACT_640104].  A contact 
[CONTACT_640105].   
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either an active study N-SWEAT Patch 
(Treatment) or a sham patch (Sham).  There will be no procedural difference 
between the Treatment Arm and the Sham Arm.  The randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_640087] [ADDRESS_856553] be evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint.  Up to 10 additional 
subjects may be enrolled to account for loss to follow up or other missing and critical 
data. 
Crossovers are not permitted by [CONTACT_3181].  Subjects may only receive the N-
SWEAT Patch if they are randomized to do so.   
8.5.2 Blinding  
Subjects in the randomized cohort will be blinded to the Study Arm to which they are 
randomized.    
Site personnel will not be informed of the specific Study Arm assignment (they will 
only know the treatment # assigned); those administering the treatment will observe 
the treatment effect and the disposal process and may be unblinded as a result of 
their observations.  This person will not conduct the follow-up assessments.  These 
personnel will be instructed and trained not to reveal the assumed Study Arm 
assignment to any subject or to any of the other study personnel at the site.  Site 
personnel completing follow-up evaluations will be different from the person who 
conducted the procedure and, therefore, will be blinded to the subject’s treatment.  
Subjects will be instructed (by [CONTACT_640106] G) not to discuss their 
assumed treatment assignment with anyone at the study site.  
Only necessary persons at the sponsor shall know the treatment assignments and 
only those persons will have access to the database which holds the key for the 
treatment numbers distributed at each site.  All others at the sponsor will remain 
blinded.

8.7    Procedure 
 
The Candesant N-SWEAT Patch is intended for use only by [CONTACT_472407].  All investigators and support staff will be provided comprehensive training 
by [CONTACT_640109] (or their designee) in the handling, use, and disposal of the 
patch.  Treatment will be performed in a clinic or doctor’s office, by a trained medical 
professional.  
 
8.7.1 Immediately Pre-Treatment  
The following baseline evaluations will be performed immediately prior to treatment, in 
the following order.  
Treatment Site Identification:  The target treatment area should be chosen by 
[CONTACT_68108] a relatively flat area with the highest concentration of hair follicles.  This 
placement is intended to maximize contact [CONTACT_640090].  The 
planned treatment site may be marked for convenience.   
Treatment Site Assessment:  Although an assessment should have been conducted 
prior to randomization; the planned treatment area(s) should be inspected a final time 
to ensure the planned site meets treatment requirements as outlined in the N-SWEAT 
Patch Instructions for use (IFU).  The area must be free of residue, and free of Initial Screening of Subject Medical Record

both visual and tactile assessment of any irregularities.  
Note: Areas with skin tags, moles or other skin abnormalities that are not indicative 
of abraded skin are permissible for treatment.  At the discretion of the treating 
physician the area may be avoided with strategic patch placement and/or use of 
an adhesive strip.   
Note: If skin irritation is noted, it should be assessed in accordance with the 
Erythema and Clinical Signs/Symptoms ( Appendix B ).  If irritation greater than [ADDRESS_856557] may only be treated after the issue has been resolved 
(less than or equal to 1).

Treatment Site Preparation:  The subject’s axilla will be cleaned with alcohol to 
ensure that no residual deodorant / anti-perspi[INVESTIGATOR_640071].  The area shall then be thoroughly dried. 
Photos:  Pre-treatment photos are to be taken of each axilla and maintained by [CONTACT_640111] a baseline reference in the event that an adverse skin reaction should 
occur or another matter necessitating review for patient safety.  Photos are to be taken 
with a high-resolution camera with the arm in the standardized treatment position and 
adequately illuminated.   Photos are to be marked with Subject ID, date and subject 
side (i.e. Right or Left).  Photos are to be taken with a measurement calibration 
reference visible.  
 
8.7.2 Patch Application 
An overview of the patch appplication procedure is provided below; however, it is 
critical to reference the IFU provided for additional treatment and handling details.   
Per the IFU, all personnel involved in the handling of the provided patch must have 
gloved hands at all times.  
The patch will be placed on the target treatment area (as previously described).  If the 
subject reports any pain or uncomfortable sensation at the time of patch placement;  
the patch should be immediately removed.    
Upon placement of the patch, the timer shall be started.  Every [ADDRESS_856559] reports a pain 
level greater than 8 or shows a 8 or higher using the Wong-Baker FACES pain scale 
(Figure 3 ); the patch should be removed immediately regardless of the time that the 
patch has been in place.

8.8   Follow-up Evaluations  
Subjects will undergo phone evaluations at 24 hours (± 12 hours) and 2-weeks (±2 
days) following treatment, at which time subjects will be asked about their discomfort 
and if they may have experienced an AE. If the subject has symptoms, a telehealth or 
clinical visit should be scheduled to assess the subject’s condition within [ADDRESS_856564]-treatment. Visit will include a physical 
exam, assessment of vitals, and treatment site assessment.  Any new treatment area 
symptoms should result in a telehealth or clinic visit being scheduled (within 24 hours) 
to assess the subject’s conditions. Any concern for burn injury should result in an in-
person clinic visit.  In addition, a written daily dairy will be provided to subjects to record 
treatment site pain or other symptoms.   
 
Beginning 1-week post treatment, the subject will be asked to complete the HDSS and 
QoL surveys electronically once per week.  The survey may be taken electronically via 
cell phone, tablet or computer.  The subject will receive instructions at the baseline visit.  
Subject will be reminded to complete the surveys via text or email, per their preference.  
In the event that the electronic submission is not possible, the subject will be asked to 
complete the surveys on paper and mail it to the clinic.  If a subject fails to complete the 
survey in a timely matter the site will be notified so that they can make contact [CONTACT_640114].   
Subjects will be asked to schedule follow-up evaluations at 2-week intervals starting on 
4-weeks (i.e. 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-weeks post-treatment). However , the 4-week visit 
is required to take place as an office visit .  The rest of the visits are recommended to

of a variable does not support the use of parametric statistics, nonparametric 
approaches or data transformations may be implemented.  If data transformations are 
used, they will be specified in the final clinical report. 
 
9.2   Study Design, Randomization and Blinding 
The Sahara Study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, blinded, pi[INVESTIGATOR_640076] N-SWEAT Patch.  
Subjects with primary axillary hyperhidrosis or excessive sweating (defined by a score 
of 3 or 4 on the HDSS), who have provided informed consent and have met the study 
eligibility criteria, will participate. Up to [ADDRESS_856573] 10 
subjects will be treated with the N-SWEAT patch and constitute the roll-in cohort and up 
to 110 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:[ADDRESS_856574] the study.  
All others at the sponsor will remain blinded. 
9.3   Sample Size and Power Considerations 
The primary effectiveness evaluation is driving the randomized sample size for the trial.   
The maximum of two scenarios considered required 50 evaluable per randomized group 
at 4 weeks of follow-up.   Increasing that number for up to 10% attrition requires [ADDRESS_856575] 80% power for the primary efficacy objective.

  The trial is also designed to also enroll a roll-in cohort of N=[ADDRESS_856576]-treatment in subjects 
randomized to treatment vs. sham (primary effectiveness endpoint) accompanied by [CONTACT_103223].   
  
9.5  Analysis Sets / Populations 
9.5.1 Roll-in Cohort 
The roll-in cohort is an initial cohort of N=10 treatment subjects enrolled at one 
investigational site to provide FDA with an initial assessment for safety of the device.  
Efficacy endpoints for roll-in subjects will be restricted to summary statistics and 
reported separately for roll-in subjects. 
 
9.5.2 Intent-to-Treat Population 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized patients assigned to 
treatment. In this population, treatment will be based on the treatment to which 
patients were randomly assigned regardless of which treatment they actually 
received. 
 
9.5.3 Safety Population 
 The safety population is the ITT population plus the roll-in cohort. 
9.5.4 Modified Intent-to-Treat and Full Analysis Set 
The modified intent to treat (mITT) will include all randomized patients in the ITT 
population who were exposed to randomized treatment.  The full-analysis set (FAS) 
is those mITT subjects that have evaluable data for the endpoint.   
The mITT population, like the ITT population, will include all randomized patients 
assigned to treatment regardless of which treatment they actually received. 
However, unlike the ITT population, the mITT population excludes patients who are 
randomized but fail to initiate treatment (treatment or control patch).   
9.5.5 Per-Protocol Set 
The Per Protocol Set (PP) will include all randomized subjects in the FAS who did 
not have any major protocol violations. Definitions of major and minor protocol 
violations will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) prior to data lock and 
unblinding of the person(s) determining major or minor status. If no subjects are 
excluded from the PP, the PP will not be required. The PP will be used for 
supporting analyses of efficacy data.

Once all subjects complete 4 weeks of follow-up, the data will be summarized for 
evaluation of the endpoints.   Lastly, the data will be summarized when all subjects 
complete 12 weeks of follow-up.   
 
9.7 Assessment of Comparability of Randomized Groups and Evaluation for 
Pooling  
9.7.1 Demographics / Baseline Characteristics and Protocol Administration 
Patient disposition will be listed and summarized for the mITT, ITT and roll-in 
data sets by [CONTACT_1570].  Protocol deviations will be collected and 
summarized by [CONTACT_640117]-in group.   
Demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity) and baseline characteristics 
(HDSS, GSP, Fitzpatrick skin type, and BMI) will be summarized by [CONTACT_640118], mITT and roll-in groups.   
The randomized groups will be compared at time of randomization for the 
important demographics and baseline characteristics specified.   Should 
additional important baseline parameters be identified prior to the analysis, they 
will be evaluated in the same manner.  Any of the variables that are significant 
at a two-sided =0.05 will be evaluated as covariates or strata variables in the 
primary effectiveness analysis or as an additional or supporting analysis to the 
primary effectiveness endpoint and if desired, secondary/observational 
endpoints as well.  Continuous variables will be evaluated both as stratification

Sample Size Rationale: .  The sample size and power calculations for the 
randomized cohort are based on the company’s clinical trial data as well as on 
published data (Glaser et al., 2012). To account for substantial variability in the 
proportion of responders across various trials, multiple scenarios were considered. 
Per definition of the primary endpoint a responder is a patient with HDSS values of [ADDRESS_856580] treatment. If proportions of responders in the treated vs. sham 
arms are 85% vs. 60%, respectively, then using PASS 2019, testing two proportions 
using the Mantel-Haenszel test,  [ADDRESS_856581] the 
treatment difference with the 80% power at the 0.05 two-sided significance level. If 
proportions of responders in the treated vs. sham arms are 73% vs. 44%, then 45 
patients per arm will be needed. The evaluable sample size of 50 patients per arm 
was chosen 
Primary Statistical Analysis :   The proportion of patients with HDSS of [ADDRESS_856582]-treatment will be compared between treatment vs. sham using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_640122] 3 vs. 4 in 
the FAS population.  Statistical significance is achieved with two-sided p-value <0.05 
equivalent to one-sided p-value < 0.025.   
Additional Statistical Analysis:  Additional analyses include those summarized in 
Section 9.7.3 Evaluation for Pooling of Data and Section 9.8 Handling of Missing 
Data for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint.  The primary statistical analysis will be 
completed in the PP population as well.   
An analysis will also be performed using all available time points with complete 
follow-up at the time of the analysis.  A generalized linear mixed model  be used to 
compare the proportion of subjects with HDSS of 1 or 2 between randomized groups 
over time on study.   The dependent variable is HDSS of 1 or 2 (Y/N) with 
independent variables to include randomized group, follow-up time, baseline HDSS 
and two-way interaction terms.  The covariance structure among the compound 
symmetric, auto-regressive and unstructured that provides the best model fit by [CONTACT_640123].   
A hierarchical stepwise backward elimination technique will be used to reduce the 
model.   The two-way interactions will be reviewed first, the two-way interaction with 
the largest p-value provided that p-value is greater than 0.[ADDRESS_856583] interactions 
with p-values < 0.[ADDRESS_856584] 
interactions.   This analysis will be repeated in the PP population as well.  

  9.10.2   Secondary Efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS] Type I Error Control, Additional Claims and Labeling 
Should the primary effectiveness endpoint be found to be statistically significant, 
additional secondary endpoints will be evaluated for inclusion in the labeling for the 
device including p-values and 95% confidence intervals.   The secondary 
endpoints listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] are in priority order and will be evaluated in 
that order.   If statistical significance is achieved for the highest priority endpoint 
the testing will move to the next highest until either statistical significance is not 
reached, or the list has ended.   This ordered hypothesis approach permits each 
hypothesis to be evaluated at two sided =0.05 or equivalently one-side =0.025  
and controls the study-wide Type I error at 5%.    
Secondary endpoints or additional analysis outside of those that do support 
additional claims are supportive in nature and not intended to support additional 
claims.   Data may be included in labelling per agreement with the FDA and will be 
limited to summary statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, 
maximum, number and percent) and will not include 95% confidence intervals or p-
values.  For more information about the secondary endpoint analyses see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Objectives.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Priority Order and Hypothesis Tests 
 
These hypothesis tests will be evaluated in the FAS population.  
 
1.  To prove that the mean improvement in QoL scale Bother from 
baseline to 4-weeks is statistically significantly greater in the 
treatment group as compared to the sham group. 
Hypothesis :   
Ho:  The mean improvement in QoL scale Bother from baseline to 4-weeks in 
subjects randomized to treatment ( T) will be lower than or equal to that in 
subjects randomized to sham ( S), (T) ≤ S. 
Ha:  The mean improvement in QoL scale Bother from baseline to 4-weeks in 
subjects randomized to treatment ( T) will be greater than that in subjects 
randomized to sham ( S), T > S. 
Success is defined as a statistically significant difference (at the 0.05 two-sided 
significance level) between least squared means for randomized groups.

3. To prove that the proportion of patients with improvement of at least 
2 grades from baseline to 4-weeks in HDSS is statistically 
significantly greater in the treatment group as compared to the sham 
group. 
Hypothesis :

baseline to 4 weeks in HDSS in subjects randomized to treatment (p T) will be 
lower than or equal to that in subjects randomized to sham (p S),  pT ≤ pS 
Ha:  The proportion of subjects with improvement of at least 2 grades from 
baseline to 4 weeks in HDSS in subjects randomized to treatment (p T) will be

Success is defined as a statistically significant difference (at the 0.05 two-sided 
significance level) between proportions of patients with at least [ADDRESS_856585] stratified by [CONTACT_640124] (3 vs. 4). 
4. Proportion of subjects with at least 50% improvement in gravimetric 
sweat production (GSP) in subjects treated with the N-SWEAT Patch 
only at 4-weeks.  (GSP will be calculated based on the total sweat 
produced by [CONTACT_640125].)  
Ho:  The proportion of subjects with at least 50% improvement in gravimetric 
sweat production (GSP) in subjects randomized to treatment (p T) is not 
statistically significantly different from 0, p T = 0. 
Ha:  The proportion of subjects with at least 50% improvement in gravimetric sweat 
production (GSP) in subjects randomized to treatment (p T) is statistically 
significantly different from 0, p T ≠ 0. Success is defined as a statistically significant 
result (at the 0.05 two-sided significance level).  It is expected that at least 50% of 
subjects will have at least 50% improvement in gravimetric sweat production from 
baseline at 4-weeks.

  10. ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Definitions 
The definitions below are in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE].  Both the investigator and the 
sponsor will comply with all local medical device reporting requirements.   
Adverse Events (AEs) may occur during the investigational procedure or during the 
follow-up phase.  AEs occurring prior to the use of the N-SWEAT device will be 
documented in the subject’s medical record but will not count as related to the 
investigational device or procedure.   
10.1.[ADDRESS_856597] clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory finding) in study participants, 
users, or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device and events 
related to the procedures involved except for events in users or other persons, which 
only include events related to investigational devices. 
10.1.2   Adverse Device Events 
An Adverse Device Event (ADE) is defined as an AE related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. This definition includes any adverse events resulting 
from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, 
installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device as 
well as any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the 
investigational medical device. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment-Related Adverse Event 
A treatment-related AE is any AE that starts on or after the time of treatment that a 
physician considers a result of treatment; the AE may or may not be related to the 
study device.   Treatment-related events will be assessed for relationship to the 
device.  The occurrence of treatment-related AEs will be summarized as part of the 
assessment for safety.   
10.1.3   Serious Adverse Events 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that: 
 Led to death. 
 Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either resulted in: 
 A life-threatening illness or injury.  The term life-threatening  in the definition of 
serious refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe. 
 A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function

   Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-
existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE. 
 Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
 Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
If an event is not an AE per the definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if 
serious conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease 
under study, death due to progression of disease). 
10.1.4   Serious Adverse Device Events 
A Serious Adverse Device Event (SADE) is defined as an ADE that has resulted in 
any of the consequences characteristic of an SAE. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_856598] to its identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance.  Device deficiencies include 
malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling. 
10.1.6 Unanticipated Adverse Device Events 
According to 21 CFR 812.3(s), a Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) is any 
serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational 
plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 
10.2 Adverse Event Review by [CONTACT_640131]/or procedure.  In addition, the investigator will identify the 
date of onset, any required treatment or intervention, severity, and duration.  All AEs will 
be monitored until they are adequately resolved, stabilized and/or explained.

  Table 6.  AE Severity 
Severity  Description  
Mild Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor 
irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do 
not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are 
transient.  
Moderate Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant 
and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some 
interference with functioning   
Severe* Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually 
incapacitating  
Based on the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Guidelines (2018) 
*Severe does not indicate an SAE (Serious Adverse Event).  Please see 10.1.3 for a definition of Serious Adverse Event. 
 
10.2.2   Relationship to N-SWEAT Patch 
The investigator will use the terms below to rate the relationship of the AE to the 
patch. 
Table 7.  AE Relationship to Device 
Relationship  Description  
Not Related  not associated with patch 
 due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another device or drug  
Unlikely  little or no temporal relationship to the patch  
 a more likely alternative etiology exists  
Possible  temporal sequence between patch and event 
 is such that the relationship is not unlikely or  
 Subject’s condition or concomitant therapy could have caused the AE  
Probable  temporal sequence is relevant or 
 event abates upon patch application completion/removal or  
 event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_31388]’s condition  
Highly 
Probable  temporal sequence is relevant and  
 event abates upon patch application completion/removal or reappearance of the 
event on repeat patch application  
 
10.3 Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs and ADEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_640132] (CRFs) provided. The investigator at each site is ultimately responsible for 
reporting AEs to the IRB according to IRB requirements and to the sponsor in 
accordance with the Investigational Plan and applicable FDA regulations. The site will 
be instructed to report all AEs considered moderate or severe and all local skin 
reactions to Candesant within 5 working days of the identification of the AE.    
If an Adverse Event is considered a local skin reaction within the treated area, photos 
are required to be submitted as part of the Adverse Event Report.   Submitted photos 
should show documentation of AE onset, AE progression and/or healing and AE

arm in the standardized treatment position and adequately illuminated.  Photos are to 
be marked with Subject ID, date and subject side (i.e. Right or Left).  Photos are to be 
taken with a measurement calibration reference visible. 
AEs or complications meeting the definition for UADEs must be reported by [CONTACT_640133], but in no event, later than [ADDRESS_856600] (DSMB) will be established to protect 
patient safety and ensure data integrity for the Sahara Study.  The board will be 
comprised of 3-5 clinical physicians with expertise in dermatology who are not 
participants in the study.  The DSMB will serve in three roles in the safety overview of 
the Sahara study: 
 To convene as needed for review of Adverse Events related to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_640078] a root cause analysis of these events.  
 To conduct a monthly blinded review of all AEs reported during enrollment and 
until the final subject has reported for 4-week follow-up.  
 If warranted, to request unblinding and fully investigate any potential safety 
signal.  This investigation may result in a recommendation to stop the clinical 
study if the findings indicate an unacceptable or unknown safety risk.    
A charter will establish the DSMB details on the operation of the DSMB.

outstanding study documents, ensure that the investigator’s files are accurate and 
complete, review record retention requirements with the investigator, make a final 
accounting of all study supplies, and ensure that all applicable requirements are met for 
the study.  The observations and actions made at this visit will be documented in a 
close-out visit report. 
Once all sites are considered closed, the study may be closed.  Study closeout will 
include a final report which will be submitted to each participating investigator, IRB, and 
other governing agency, as required. 
 
15.1 Study Suspension or Early Termination 
The study can be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or study sponsor for 
reasons including, but not limited to, the following: 
 Occurrence of AEs unknown to date in respect to their nature, severity, or 
duration, or the unexpected incidence of known AEs 
 Obtaining new scientific knowledge that shows that the study is no longer valid or 
necessary 
 Insufficient recruitment of subjects 
 UADE presenting an unreasonable risk to subjects (Sponsor may terminate the 
study immediately) 
 Persistent non-compliance with the protocol 
 Persistent non-compliance with IRB or regulatory requirements 
If the study is discontinued or suspended prematurely, the sponsor shall promptly inform 
all clinical investigator(s)/investigational center(s) of the termination or suspension and 
the reason(s) for this.  The IRB shall also be informed promptly and provided with the 
reason(s) for the termination or suspension by [CONTACT_640145]/investigational center(s).  Regulatory authorities and the personal 
clinician(s) of the subjects may also need to be informed if deemed necessary.

  APPENDIX A: HDSS 
 
Information and Instructions:  
About Sweating:  
Sweating is a natural and healthy part of life. Sweating helps to cool the body and maintain a normal body 
temperature in a warm environment or during exercise. It is normal to sweat when you are hot, when you are 
exercising, and when you are feeling stressed.    
About Excessive Sweating:    
You are in this study because you feel like you sweat too much.  You may sweat at times other than when you are 
warm, exercising, or stressed.  The questions below are designed to measure the severity and impact of your 
excessive underarm sweating during the past week. While you may experience excessive sweating on other parts of 
your body, these questions are designed to measure the impact of the treatment on your underarm sweating ONLY.   
Instructions:  
 Please only think about your underarm sweat as you answer these questions.  
 Please remember that sweating when you are hot, exercising or stressed is normal, so when you are answering 
the questions, think about sweating that is beyond normal.  For example, you may sweat when you work out at 
the gym and still answer “never” since sweating at the gym during a strenuous workout is considered to be the 
body’s natural response to keep the body cool.  
 There are no right or wrong answers; you should answer truthfully about your excessive underarm sweating 
experiences during this past week  
 If you have any questions, you may contact [CONTACT_640146].  
Prior to each statement there is a number (1, 2, 3, and 4). This number is the “HDSS score”.

APPENDIX B:  LOCAL SKIN REACTIONS 
 
 
An assessment for local skin reactions is conducted by [CONTACT_640147]-
treatment, immediately post-treatment and at all clinic visits following treatment. .  
The assessment is also used during the course of evaluating and reporting an AE 
that is a local skin reaction.   
  
The overall scoring system is comprised of an erythema rating scale plus the addition of 
clinical descriptors adapted from Dykes, 1992 and the FDA Guidance for Industry: Skin 
Irritation and Sensitization Testing of Generic Transdermal Drug Products (1999). The 
severity of erythema is rated on a scale of 0–5 along with the presence of other clinical 
signs or symptoms. These descriptors noted by [CONTACT_281720], are then added to the numerical 
score (e.g., 3S).  For example:  Erythema spreading outside the treatment site with 
subject reporting scaling = 3 S 
 
 
Table 8: Skin Erythema Assessment 
Rating Description  
0 No reaction/No erythema 
1 Minimal erythema (barely perceptible) 
2 Erythema (easily visible) 
3 Erythema, spreading outside of treated site 
4 Erythema, spreading outside of treated site with either edema (swelling) or vesicles 
(elevated, circumscribed lesions up to 1 cm in size that are filled with serous fluid) 
5 Severe reaction with ulceration (irregularly sized and shaped erosions of the skin 
extending into the dermis)

  APPENDIX D:  GSP INSTRUCTIONS 
 
Materials Required 
 
 Quantitative Filter Papers, 90 mm 
 Room temperature environment (26°C-30°C recommended).  Actual room 
temperature must be documented to ensure that the same temperature is applied for 
each gravimetric test.   
 
Procedure 
 
GSP should be measured at screening, baseline (˜72 hours later) and at the 4-week 
follow-up visit.  Measurements should be performed in the same position(s) (sitting, 
standing, or walking) at every visit.  The position used should be document in the 
subject records.  If the screening GSP Measurement and the Baseline GSP 
Measurement differ by [CONTACT_726] 100%, the subject should not be enrolled.  GSP 
should not exceed 300 mg/5 min in either axilla at either screening or baseline 
 
 
IMPORTANT:  Each gravimetric measurement must be taken in similar room 
conditions (same humidity and temperature as baseline). Whenever possible all 
Gravimetric tests for this study (screening, baseline and 4-weeks) should be taken at 
the same time of day (±3 hours).   
 
A minimum of two (2) measurements should be taken in each axilla at every timepoint 
to ensure accuracy of results. If following the 2nd readings there is concern regarding the 
measurement accuracy, a 3rd reading may be performed.  An average of accurate 
reading(s) will be reported.   
 
 Weigh the plastic tube (vial) with filter paper to be used for the assessment (in 
milligrams) and document the baseline combined weight of the filter paper and vial.   
 Dry the subject’s axilla with an absorbent tissue or similar. Allow subject to sit for 15 
minutes at room temperature ( 20-25.6°C)  
 Determine the planned treatment area and desired location for filter paper 
placement. Paper should be placed centrally, just under the axilla crease formed 
when arms are down by [CONTACT_282879].   
 Place the previously weighed filter paper in the subject’s armpit and ask them to 
hold it there for [ADDRESS_856622] filter paper application (paper placed in vial and 
weighed).  The difference is calculated in milligrams and recorded as mg/5mins.

Third Degree (Full Thickness): Whitish, charred or translucent, no pin prick sensation in 
burned area.  
 
Percentage Total Body Surface Area (TBSA)  
 
 
Burn Center Referral Criteria  
A burn center may treat adults, children, or both. Burn injuries that should be referred to a 
burn center include:  
1. Partial thickness burns greater than 10% total body surface area (TBSA).  
2. Burns that involve the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints.  
3. Third degree burns in any age group.  
4. Electrical burns, including lightning injury.  
5. Chemical burns.  
6. Inhalation injury.  
7. Burn injury in patients with preexisting medical disorders that could complicate 
management, prolong recovery, or affect mortality.  
8. Any patient with burns and concomitant trauma (such as fractures) in which the burn 
injury poses the greatest risk of morbidity or mortality. In such cases, if the trauma 
poses the greater immediate risk, the patient may be initially stabilized in a trauma 
center before being transferred to a burn unit. Physician judgment will be necessary 
in such situations and should be in concert with the regional medical control plan and 
triage protocols.  
9. Burned children in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_640084].  
10. Burn injury in patients who will require special social, emotional, or rehabilitative 
intervention.

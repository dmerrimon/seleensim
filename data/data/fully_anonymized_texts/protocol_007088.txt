Treatment on Pulmonary Function in Adults with Asthma  
IRB Approval Date: January 8, [ADDRESS_144269] of mouth targeting Des Moines University 
(DMU) students and faculty. Inclusion criteria for participa tion in the study included being 18 years of 
age or older and having a diagnosis of asthma, regardless of whether spi[INVESTIGATOR_127944]. Exclusion criteria included being a current smoker, having any other respi[INVESTIGATOR_127945],  and receiving Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) from a licensed physician or 
chiropractic or massage treatment for [ADDRESS_144270] of OMT.  
 
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire  
Participants completed the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities (AQLQ(S)) 
to subjectivel y measure asthma severity. The AQLQ is a 32 -item survey which asks participants to recall 
their experiences during the previous two weeks as they relate to four domains (symptoms, activity 
limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli). Each i tem is rated on a 7 -point Likert scale, 
with 1 being severely impaired and 7 being not impaired at all. This was taken in week 0 to establish a 
subjective baseline value as perceived by [CONTACT_2299]. Participants completed this questionnaire 
again in we ek 7 to be used as a subjective measurement of their asthma severity after OMT. We 
compared the mean scores for each item, each domain, and the overall average.  
 
Pulmonary Function Measurements  
Pulmonary function testing was done using a portable spi[INVESTIGATOR_127946] (McKesson LUMEON, Andover, MA, 
[LOCATION_003]). Testing was conducted by [CONTACT_127956], after training with a licensed 
pulmonologist. Subjects were required to perform three trials deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_96945][INVESTIGATOR_127947] (Easy on -PC), and th e trial with the best overall effort as determined by [CONTACT_127957]. The spi[INVESTIGATOR_127948]’ pulmonary function included 
forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_31737] ( FEV1 ), forced vital capacity  (FVC), the F EV1/FVC ratio , and peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] ( PEF).  
 
 
OMT Protocol  
An OMT protocol was derived from a survey of the DMU OMM Department faculty as well as 
current and past DMU OMM Fellows. The survey included questi ons regarding the approach each 
participant would use when treating an asthmatic patient with OMT. Based on the survey results, the 
current undergraduate OMM Fellows of DMU developed the standardized OMT protocol used during 
each of the three OMT sessions.  These sessions lasted 21.3 ± 3.6 minutes. The protocol included the 
following techniques: supi[INVESTIGATOR_127949] (BLT), supi[INVESTIGATOR_127950], supi[INVESTIGATOR_127951], stimulatory supi[INVESTIGATOR_127952], sup ine respi[INVESTIGATOR_127953], supi[INVESTIGATOR_127954], seated thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_127955], and seated posterior rib 
Still technique.  
After the undergraduate OMM Fellows (AJ, ST, EK, AB) completed the treatment protocol, all 
participants were rechecked  for somatic dysfunction resolution by [CONTACT_127958] [ADDRESS_144271] -certified OMM/NMM 
physicians (JP, KH). If inadequate resolution at a specific body region was found, that region was 
retreated using the same technique included in the protocol. The retreatment lasted, on average, 6.[ADDRESS_144272] smooth muscle.  
 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Changes in FEV1, FVC, the FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF were determined by [CONTACT_127959]. The immediate effect of OMT was determined by 
[CONTACT_127960], and the previous 
week’s measurements to those taken immediately after the subsequent treatment. The intermediate 
effect was determined by [CONTACT_127961]’s three -days -post -OMT measurements. The long -term effect was determined by 
[CONTACT_127962]. Each comparison was 
analyzed using a repeated -measure  ANOVA  on random subjects. The Westfall method was used to 
adjust p -values.  
Changes in participants’ survey results were determined by [CONTACT_127963] , then comparing the post -OMT values to the pre -
OMT values. These values were analyzed usi ng paired t -tests.  
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS  ® Software, with the guidance of  Chunfa Jie, 
PhD and Simon Geletta, PhD of the Des Moines University Research and Public Health Department, 
respectively.

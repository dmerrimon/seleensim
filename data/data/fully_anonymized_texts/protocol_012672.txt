INTRODUCTION:  
 
Before you say that  you will be in this clinical trial (a kind of research study) you need to read 
this form.  It is important for you to understand all the information in this form.  This form will 
tell you what the clinical trial is about and how it will be done.  It will tell you about some 
problems that might happen during the clinical trial.  It will also tell you about the good things 
that might happen for you during the clinical trial.  When you read a paper like this to learn about 
a clinical trial it is called “infor med consent.”  The people who are doing this clinical trial are 
giving you very important information about the clinical trial.  When you give your consent for 
something, it is the same as giving your permission.  This consent form may contain words that 
you do not understand.  Please talk with one of the doctors or their staff if you have questions.  
Do not sign this consent form unless all your questions have been answered and you feel 
comfortable with the information you have read.  You will be given a c opy of the form to keep.  
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed as having an 
arrhythmia that requires a pacemaker or defibrillator.  
 
Why Is This Study Being Done?  
 
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects  of two routinely used anesthetics,  Lidocaine 
with a mixture of Lidocaine and Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_742880] a pacemaker or defibrillator.  
This research is being performed because w e do not know if one of these  two common ly used  
anesthetic  regimens is better  in terms of minimizing post -operative pain and/or patient movement 
during insertion of the defibrillator or pacemaker .  
What is the Status of the Drugs involved in this study?  
• Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_742881].

    • Lidocaine is currently approved by [CONTACT_3133].   
How Many People Will Take Part In The Study?  
 
About 300 people will take part in this study at this location.  
 
What Is Involved In The Study?  
 
You are scheduled to have either a pacemaker or defibrillator surgery. Before this surgery, you 
will be randomly assigned (by [CONTACT_742886][INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to r eceive either Lidocaine or a 
mixture of Lidocaine and Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_742882] a way to make the site of the incision numb. Receiving 
one of these medicines is approved and considered standard.  Your surgery will then be done 
exactly in the same manner as it would be done even if you were not in the study.  
 
Data will be collecte d about how each of these works. This information will be collected and 
compared to see if one of these treatments is better and has less problems.  
 
There are only two things that are  different in this study from if you had surgery in the standard 
way. The first  is that the type of medicine used will be randomly assigned, rather than you or 
your surgeon choosing which of these will be used. The second difference is that data will be 
collected and analyzed about your surgery and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59361].  
 
How L ong Will I Be In The Study?  
 
You will be in the study for the day of your pacemaker or defibrillator  surgery .  All the 
information we need from you will be taken on the day of your defibrillator or pacemaker 
surgery.  
The researcher may decide to take you off the study if he/she decides that it is important for them 
to be  able to choose which drug you have before the surgery .  
You can stop taking part  in this study at any time.  However, if you decide to stop taking part  in 
the study, we encourage you to talk to the researcher and your regular doctor first.  
 
What Are The Risks of The Study?   
 
There is no evidence that one medication (Lidocaine or Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ) is better than the other, and 
if you were not in this study your doctor would decide which medication would be used for your 
surgery based on his or her preference.  One of these medications would have been given to you 
for your surgery even if you did n ot participate in this study.  However, if you participate in this 
study, we will randomly assign you to receive either Lidocaine or a mixture of Lidocaine and 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] .   
 
While on the study, you are at risk for some side effects.  You should discuss t hese with the 
researcher and/or your regular doctor.  There also may be other side effects that we cannot 
predict. Other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and uncomfortable.  Many

   Revision date: 04/04/[ADDRESS_1015604] shortly after Lidocaine or Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_742883], but in some cases side 
effects can be serious or long lasting and permanent.    
 
  
Risks of Lidocaine:   allergic reaction , low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, fast heart rate, 
slow heart rate, feeling light headed, tremors, seizure, chest pain, weak pulse, nausea, vomiting, 
anxiety, speech problems and headache.  
 
 
Risks of Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] : allergic reaction, low blood pressure , difficulty breathing , fast heart rate, 
slow heart rate, feeling light headed, tremors, shivering, weak pulse, nausea, vomiting, anxiety , 
speech problems  and headache.  
 
 
While these drugs do have potential risks, remember that you would get one of these drugs even 
if you were not in the study, so your risks are no greater for being in the study than if you w ere 
not in the study.  
 
Your doctor may be an investigator in this research study.  If so, s/he is interested both in your 
medical care and in the conduct of this research.  Before you sign up for this study or at any time 
during the research, you may disc uss your care with another doctor who is not associated with 
this research project.  You are not under any obligation to take part  in any research study offered 
by [CONTACT_4904].  
 
Are There Benefits to Taking Part in The Study?   
 
If you agree to take part in  this study, there may or may not be direct medical benefit to you.  We 
hope that the information learned from this study will benefit other patients with this disease in 
the future.  
 
What Other Options Are There?   
 
Instead of being in this study, you have the following options:  
 
You may still have your surgery , and your physician will choose what medication to use for your 
procedure.  If you choose not to participate your information will not be used for this study.  If 
you do not participate in this study i t will not affect you treatment or  surgery in any way.  
Please talk to your regular doctor about these and other options.

 Adjudication of Events  
 Clinical Events Committee (CEC)  
An independent Clinic al Events Committee will be assembled to review and adjudicate strokes, 
cranial nerve injuries, and UADEs (and their relationship to the device or procedure) events , as 
well as major protocol deviations  affecting patient safety , that occur while a patient is enrolled in 
the study .  The committee will be comprised of a multidisciplinary group of physicians including at 
least one neurologist , at least one vascular surgeon  and at least one cardiologist. The committee 
members will not be participating in the tr ial and will not have an affiliation with the Sponsor, 
Investigators, or Study  sites.  
 Strokes  
The CEC will adjudicate all suspected strokes.   
15.2.1  Major Stroke  
A Major Stroke  is to be defined as an increase of 5 or more in NIH Stroke Scale from baseline 
score and a Modified Rankin Score of ≥3. 
 
Note:  If NIH ≥4 at enrollment, any change ≥5 is considered a major stroke.  If Rankin ≥3 at 
enrollment, and change ≥[ADDRESS_638745] 2.  
 
Note:  If NIH ≥4 at enrollment, any change ≤4 is considered a minor stroke  
 
 Cranial Nerve Injuries  
The CEC will adjudicate all  suspected cranial nerve injuries that occur  within 30 days  (+7 days)  of 
the procedure.  
 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size   
 Overview  
The following section provides an outline of the statistical methods to be applied to the clinical 
data from this study .  A Statistical Analysis Plan, containing the details for generating the 
analyses, will be finalized prior to any analyses being conduct ed. 
16.1.1  Sample Size Calculation  
The sample size for this clinical investigation is based on the rate of procedural success within 30 
days of the stent implant.  The observed rate of procedural success in the ROADSTER 2 Study  
will be compared to an a priori  threshold of 85% derived from the ROADSTER Study.  The 
   
SRM -2015 -02_E  
(DCO 3277 ) Confidential  Page 24 of 46 
 rationale for an 85% threshold is based on the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence intervals of the procedural success rates from the ROADSTER Lead -In Phase 
(91.0%, 95% CI 81.52%,  96.64%) and the ROADSTER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] (95.7%, 95% CI 90.97%, 
98.42%).  Given that the majority of sites that will participate in the ROADSTER [ADDRESS_638746] consider outcomes 
from early enrollment.  With an observed rate of procedural success >89% in the ROADSTER 2 
Study , the results will be significant with a minimum of 600 patients, meaning the lower bound of 
the 2 -sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval will exceed 85%.  Det erministically, if 534 
patients of the 600 total cases (89%) were classified as a procedural success within [ADDRESS_638747] 95% lower binomial confidence limit would be 86.22%.  
Estimates for the 3 categories of physician level of training and experience (yes/no) will be 
summarized.  However, given the distribution of physicians by [CONTACT_496832], it is indeterminate how informative the estimates 
will be. 
 Endpoint Analyses and Hypothesis Testing  
The hypothesis testing will be focused on the proportion of patients classified as a procedural 
success, and to examine differences among the levels of physician training and the experience  of 
physicians .  
16.2.[ADDRESS_638748] observation will be 
count ed in the analysis as a procedural success.  Secondary analyses of the primary endpoint 
will consider alternative methods of imputation; the details of these supplemental analyses will be 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.    
16.2.[ADDRESS_638749], compared to an a priori  threshold of 
85.0%.  The 2 -sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals will also be presented.  Patients 
who withdraw prio r to [ADDRESS_638750] -procedure; each of the secondary endpoints is a 
dichotomous variable:  
 Acute device success  
 Technical succ ess 
 Rate of cranial nerve injury

  Rate of cardiac  death  
 Rate of neurological death  
 Rate of hierarchical ipsilateral stroke, death and MI  
 Rate of hierarchical ipsilateral stroke, death and MI by [CONTACT_496828]  
 Acute device, technical and procedural success by [CONTACT_496833]  
 Acute device, technical and procedural success by [CONTACT_496834]  
 Acute device, technical and procedural success by [CONTACT_496835] -procedure observations will serve as the baseline  values fo r calculating post procedure 
changes from baseline.  Tabulations of summary statistics, graphical presentations, and statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS software version 9.2 or higher.  The statistical analyses will 
be based on data pooled acr oss Sites  in aggregate ; a secondary tabulation will be prepared 
separately for the US and Non -US sites .  Continuous demographic parameters, such as the age 
of the patient at the time of enrollment, will be summarized for the Per -Protocol population using 
descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value, and 
95% 2 -sided confidence limits).  Continuous demographic parameters will be compared among 
the 3 levels of physician training and experience using a 1 -factor (physici an training  [1, 2 or 3] ; 
physician experience [participation in ROADSTER 1 or no participation in ROADSTER 1 ) analysis 
of variance model.  Contrast statements will be used to evaluate the individual pair wise 
comparisons (Level 1 vs. Level 2, Level 1 vs. L evel 3, and Level 2 vs. Level 3 ; participation in 
ROADSTER 1 vs no participation in ROADSTER 1 ).  Categorical demographic parameters, such 
as gender, will be summarized as a proportion of the Per -Protocol population using Clopper -
Pearson 95% [ADDRESS_638751] stratified on physician level of training (1, 2, or 3) and 
separately by [CONTACT_496833]  (participation in ROADSTER 1 vs no participation in 
ROADSTER 1) .  Additionally, a generalized linear model (PROC GENMOD) will be used to 
evaluate the main effect of physician level of experience, specifying the distribution as either 
binomial or multinomial.  Clinical and high risk factors will also be summarized as a  proportion of 
the Per -Protocol population with Clopper -Pearson 95% 2 -sided confidence limits.  In addition to 
the overall summary of the individual factors, separate summaries will be generated by [CONTACT_496836] .  Comparisons w ill be made among the 3 levels of physician 
training and physician experience  (participation in ROADSTER 1 vs no participation in 
ROADSTER 1) , depending on the type and distribution of the parameter.  
 
Data obtained during the neurological examination, including data from the NIH Stroke Scale, 
Modified Rankin Scale and Cranial Nerve Palsy Assessment will be summarized at each time 
point using descriptive statistics.  Separate summaries will be generated by [CONTACT_496837] a 1 -factor (physician level of training  [1, 2 or 3] ) and 
a 1-factor (experience: participation in ROADSTER 1 vs. no participation in ROADSTER 1 ) 
analysis of variance model.  Contrast statements will be used to evaluate the individual pair wise 
comparisons (Level 1 vs. Level 2, Level 1 vs. Level 3, and Level 2 vs. Level 3).    
 
Specific algorithms for imputing missing or partially missing dates wi ll be discussed in the SAP.  
Derived data will be identified in the individual patient data listings.  Imputed data for dates will not 
   
SRM -2015 -02_E  
(DCO 3277 ) Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_638752] not meeting the Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria will be tabulated but not 
included in the primary endpoint analysis.  
 
 Data Collection  
Data will be entered into a validated electronic data management system.  Data fields in the 
selected electronic data management system used will be aligned such that it overlaps with the 
appropriate data fields for the post -approval study as derived from the ROADSTER IDE.

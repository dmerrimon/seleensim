Clinical Phase Not applicab le 
 
Study Rational e  Intensive home-based group  counseling with a psyc hologist are the 
only intervent ions that have been  shown to increase rates o f living 
kidney donatio n however , they are not feasib le for transpl ant 
centers . A recen t review on strategies to increase l iving kidney 
donat ion concl uded that  strategies directed at cand idates a nd the ir 
social supp01t  networ ks are the most pro mising based  on the data 
available. Therefore , we propose an intervent ion that incorporates 
individualized risk commu nication into gro up counseling with 
patients and  their suppor t networks at the transp lant cen ter. 
 
Study Objecti ve(s)  Primar y 
• To dete rmine whether  counse ling with the shared  decision aid, 
provide d in the clinical setting to cand idates along wit h 
members of t heir socia l suppo1t  netwo rk, increases  pursuit of 
transpl ant. 
Secondar y 
• To dete rmine whether the intervention influences patie nt 
knowledge  about  kidney transp lant, decisional conflict, and 
hope. 
• To deter mine  if the intervention  influences  social  suppo1t  group 
knowledge about  kidney transp lant and  intention/ motivat ion to 
support the pat ient through the transp lant process.

2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim) 
The primary o bjective of this study is to detenni ne whether co unseling with the shared 
decision  aid, prov ided in the clinica l setting  to candidates  along with  members of their social 
suppo1t netwo rk, increases p ursuit of t ranspl ant. 
 
2.2 Secondar y Objectives (or Aim)  
The secondaiy objec tives are to: 
• Determine whether the intervention influ ences patient knowledge  abou t kidney 
transp lant, dec reases dec isiona l conflict, and hope. 
• Detemline if the intervention influ ences social suppo1 t group knowl edge  about 
kidney tra nsplant and intention/ motivatio n to suppo1 t the patie nt throug h the 
transp lant process.

will be obtained d uring this  appoi ntment, if the pat ient wo uld like the partici pate in the 
intervention. After the patient has completed t he health  assessm ent phase a nd is officially a 
candidate fo r transp lant, they wi ll be emolled in the study. 
3.1.[ADDRESS_746444] undergo usual pre-transplant counseling, and w ill 
then undergo a group counseling session with m embers  of their suppmt netwo rk at the 
transplant center. The session will includ e 1) a descr iption of general options fo r treatment 
of end stage  kidney disease, 2) the  likely outcome of each of those o ptions speci fic to the 
transplant candid ate utilizing the deci sion ai d, 3) a presentat ion of common reasons to 
pursue or not pursue eac h of those options (including commo n barri ers to living donat ion), 
and 4) a discussion of how the suppo1t  netwo rk can  be involved in the transp lant process.  
Tllis discussion will be info1med by [CONTACT_569322] a previous  study.

5 STUDY EVALUATIONS  AND MEASUREMENTS  
• Informed  Consent: infmmed  consent  will be  used to infmm patients  about  the 
inte1 vention and their right s if the y choose to participate.  
•  Medical  Record  Review: medical  records will be reviewed to ensure  that patients 
meet inclu sion/exclusion criteria for inter vention . They will also be used during 
follow -up to assess our primary outcome  variable, to determine if the patient 
engaged in pur suit of transplant.  
 
•  Demographi c survey (see appendix): This  surve y will be  used to under stand the 
population participating in the intervention.  
•  Evaluative survey (see  appendix):  This survey w ill assess our  secondary outcome 
measures, to determine whether  the inter vention influen ces patient  knowledge  about 
kidney tran splant , decisional conflict, and  hope. Also, to determine if the 
inter vention  influen ces social support group kno wledge  about  kidne y transplant and 
intentio n/motivation to suppmt  the patient through the tran splant pro cess.

meas ures will include: pursuit of transplant, patient knowl edge  about  kidne y transplant, 
[ADDRESS_746450], patient hope , social support group  knowledge about kidne y 
transplant  and social support group  intentio n/moti vation to support the patient  through the 
transplant process. A process evaluation will be conducted to ensme the inter vention i s

6 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
The sample  size ( n=60) w ill be sufficient for conducting statistica l analysis  of the 
inter vention.  A Student's  T-test will compare  means for the  prima1 y outcome of the number 
of inquirie s per cand idate.  Both  a Chi-squared and Student's  T-tests will be used to compar e 
seconda1 y outcomes . 
 
6.1 Primary  Endpoint  
Prima1 y endpoint: pursuit of transplant  
6.2 Secondary  Endpoints  
Seco ndaty  endpoints: patient  knowledge about  kidney transplant , decisional  conflict , and 
hope.  Also , social suppo11  group knowledge about kidne y transplant and 
intentio n/moti vatio n to suppo1t  the pati ent through the tran splant pro cess 
 
6.3 Statistical  Methods  
A Student's T-test will compare mean s for the prima1 y outcome of  the number  of inquirie s 
per candidate betwee n and within the intervention and co ntrol groups. Both a Chi -squared 
and Student's  T-tests w ill be used to compare  secondruy o utcomes between  and within the 
intervention and control groups. This is a feasibility  pi[INVESTIGATOR_27041]; therefore, it is not powered 
to test anything.  We will be co llecting data that we could adjust  for (i.e. demographic s), but 
we will not be adjusting, because the main  goal of this particulru·  study is to gauge if the 
inter vention i s feasible.

8 SAFETY  MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse  events  (AEs)  will be monitored throughout the  study  by [CONTACT_1961].  
8.2 Adverse Event  Reporting  
Since the  study  procedures are not greater than minimal  risk, SAEs  are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the  research involving risks  to subjects or  others  happen 
during the course of  this study  (including SAEs)  they will be repo1ted to the  IRB in 
accordance with IRB Attachment GGG: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to 
Subjects or Others. AEs that are not serious but  that are notable and could involve  1isks to 
subjects wi ll be summarized and  submitted to the IRB at the time of continuin g review.  
8.[ADDRESS_746455]  a causal  relationship with the treatment.  An 
adverse  event  can therefore be  any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an  abn01mal 
laborato1y  finding) , symptom , or disease  tempora lly associated with  the use of the test 
a1ticle , whether or not related to the product.  
All AEs (including SAEs) wi ll be noted in the  study  records and on the case report f01m 
with a full description including the natme, date and time  of onset , dete1mination of non- 
seriou
s versus  serious, intensity  (mild , moderate , severe) , duration , causality , and outcome 
of the event.  
8.4 Definition  of a Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An SAE  is any untoward medical  occunence that 
• results  in death , 
• is life-threatening,  
• requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707],  
• results  in a persistent  or significant  disability /incapacity , or 
• is a congenita l anomaly/bi1th  defect.  
 
8.4.1 Relation ship of SAE  to study drug or other intervention 
It is unlikely  that there  will be any SAEs  in relation  to the intervention, as the  inte1vention  is 
a social suppo 1t inte1vention. 
8.5 IRB/IEC  Notificati on of SAEs  and Other Unanticipated  Problem s 
The Investigator  will promptly notify the  IRB of  all internal (occmri ng in subjects enrolled 
at this  site) unanticipated prob lems involving r isks to subjects  or others , and Serious 
Adverse  Events  that are related to the  research activity. Rep01ts  will be submitted to the  IRB 
in accordance wit h the timeline below. External (at other sites)  SAEs that are  both 
unexpected and related to the study  intervention will be reported promptly.  
 
Category of Prompt Report Initial Notification 
Internal  (occmr ing in subjects  enrolled at this 
site), related (o r more likely related t han 
unrelated) SAE  5 days 
Internal , unrelated SAE  30 days  
External SAE  and AEs need not be  repo1te d

8.5.1 Follow-up report  
If an SAE has  not resolved at the  time of the init ial repolt  and new info1mation  ai·ises that 
changes  the investigator 's assessment  of the event , a follow-up repo 1t including all relevant 
new or reassessed info1mation (e.g.,  concomitant medication , medica l histo1y)  shou ld be 
submitted  to the IRB. The investigator  is respon sible for  ensuring t hat all  SAE  ai·e followed 
until either reso lved or stable.

Univer sity security requirement s, with the  original  paper  copy locked  in a cabinet.  
9.[ADDRESS_746457] (HIPAA)  and University sec mity 
requirement s. The original consent fo1m , HIPAA  authorizations  and any wlitten study 
c01Te sponden ce will be  kept in a locked cabinet in the  secured office suite. Only the signed 
consent fo1m  will include  patient name , phone  number , address  and EHR  number ; all other 
data stored separatel y will be linked b y a de-identifiable  number.  A scanned copy of the 
consent  f01m will be placed  in the  pa1ticipant's  EHR.  All member s of the research team 
who ha ve access to the data will have co mpleted required Good C linical Pra ctice and 
Hum an Resea rch Protections for Biomedical Study Team s and any other IRB mandated 
training.  
No identifi able data will be u sed for future  study without  first obtaining IRB approval. The 
investigator will obtain  a data use agreement between  the provider  (the Pl) of the data and 
any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] t researchers (including others at Hennepin  Healthca re) before  sharin g a limited 
dataset (PHI limited to d ates and zip  codes). 
Risk of breach  of confidentiality  will be minimal as all  data will be linked to a unique 
numerical ID which  does not con tain any personally identifiable health info1mation . No 
personally identifiable he alth info1mation will be collected for thi s study. fu the event  of a 
breach  of confidentiality , pa1ticipant s will be notified  and correcti ve actions  will be taken  as 
appro p1iate . The IRB will be promptly n otified of any  confidenti ality breaches.

appropriate. The IRB will be promptly notified of any confidentiality breaches. 
 
9.4.3 Potential  Benefits  of Trial  Participation  
The inter vention  has the potential to change  the par·adigm  of pre -transplant  counseling.  This 
would help to better info1m patient s and their  suppmt  networks to make  critical decisions 
smrnunding kidne y transplantation.

9.6 Informed  Consent /Assent  and IDPAA Authorization  
Informed consent will be ob tained by [CONTACT_387285] o f the study. The consent process w ill be 
documented in writing with the long form of consent documentation. Patients will be called 
prior  to their transplant e lgibility screening appo intm ent and asked if th ey wo uld be 
interested in h earing more abo ut the intervention. If the patient is interested, informe d 
consent will be obtained durin g their appointment at the clinic. Membe rs of the study tea m 
will obtain concen t. Patients will give co ncent for intervention participation. 
We will read the consent document with th e par ticipant, beginnin g with a co ncise and 
focused presentation of key info1m ation to assist the subject to  understand the reasons w hy 
one might or might not wa nt to pa1t icipate in the research. We will explain the deta ils in 
such a way  that the participant understands what it would be like to take part in the resear ch 
study. The interven tion w ill only begin after pat ients have gon e through the screenin g 
process and b een identified as ca ndidates fo r kidney transplant, week s after informed

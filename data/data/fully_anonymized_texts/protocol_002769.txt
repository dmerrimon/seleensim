2.0 Objectives  
2.1 The purpose of this study is to determine if sub-tenon  irrigation with 
triamcinolone acetonide at the time of surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal 
detachment will reduce the pain and inflammation caused by [CONTACT_314745] . 
2.2 Primary Hypothesis: Sub-tenon  irrigation with 1cc (40 mg) Triamcinolone 
Acetonide will significantly reduce post -operative pain at [ADDRESS_387278]-

rhegmatogenous retinal detachment . 
 
Secondary Hypotheses:  
Peri-bulbar irrigation with 1cc (40 mg) Triamcinolone Acetonide will 
significantly reduce post -operative analgesic consumption  at [ADDRESS_387279]-
operation in patients undergoing scleral buckle surgery for 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  
Peri-bulbar irrigati on with 1cc (40 mg) Triamcinolone Acetonide will 
significantly reduce post -operative nausea and vomiting score at [ADDRESS_387280]-operation in patients undergoing scleral buckle surgery for 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  
Peri-bulbar irrigation with 1cc (40 mg) Triamcinolone Acetonide will 
significantly reduce post -operative pain at 1-[ADDRESS_387281]-operation in 
patients undergoing scleral buckle surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal 
detachment . 
Peri-bulbar irrigation with 1cc (40 mg) Triamcinolone Acetonide will 
significantly reduce post -operative pain at [ADDRESS_387282]-operation in 
patients undergoing scleral buckle surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal 
detachment . 
Peri-bulbar irrigation with 1cc (40  mg) Triamcinolone Acetonide will 
significantly reduce post -operative analgesic consumption  at 1-[ADDRESS_387283]-operation in patients undergoing scleral buckle surgery for 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  
Peri-bulbar irrigation with 1cc (40 mg) Triamcinolone  Acetonide will 
significantly reduce post -operative nausea and vomiting score at 1-[ADDRESS_387284] 
that eye pain is a common and underestimated occurrence after 
vitreoretinal surgery for retinal detachment, with 56% of patients reporting 
intense pain  post-operatively. Levels of post -operative nausea were also 
correlated to the level of pain experienced.1 In a study on chronic pain 
following scler al buckle surgery, it was show n that all patients

VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 5 of 26 Revised: February 9, [ADDRESS_387285] pain 
scores. 18% of these patients experienced chronic pain for >[ADDRESS_387286] profound anti -angiogenic effects, vasoconstrictive effects, 
anti-permeability effects, ability to help maintain blood -retinal barrier, and 
facilitation of exudate reabsorptio n. Furthermore, triamcinolone has 
relatively small particles, allowing it to be injected in or around the eye, 
and has a duration of action of several months.4 Surgery in and around the 
eye has been sh own to cause intraocular inflammation, called uveitis. 
Corticosteroids are currently the cornerstone of treatment for uveitis. A 
study of perioperative intravitreal inje ction of triamcinolone during pars 
plana vitrectomy for open globe trauma demonstrated a improvement in 
visual acuity, likely due to the anti -inflammatory effects of triamcinolone.5 
Another study using triamcinolone with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_57270] a peribulbar 
injection at the conclusion of surgery for retinal detachment  demonstrated 
a reduction in the use of hydrocodone following surgery, and 
demonstrated a trend of reduced pain, though it did not reach full 
significance.6 As of yet, there is no definitive management method for 
reducing pain and swelling following scleral buckle surgery. We w ill be 
employing  a sub-tenon  irrigation approach to deliver 1cc of 40 mg / mL 
triamcinolone directly on the sutured area to reduce pain following surgery  
to try to address this gap.

no noted  adverse effects resulting from this use .  
3.3 Based on the existing literature, p rovide the scientific or scholarly 
rationale for and significance of your research and how will it add to 
existing knowledge.

VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 6 of 26 Revised: February 9, [ADDRESS_387288] -operative pain and swelling following scleral buckle 
surgery, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_314746] .7 
Multiple V istar surgeons currently use Triamcinolone Acetonide for all 
scleral buckle surgeries within the syste m, but this practice has not yet 
been proven in a randomized control trial. Some physicians are 
prescribing opi[INVESTIGATOR_314735]6; in 
today’s environment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_314736], this is something we would like to 
avoid. The significance of this study is that if the outcome is positive, it 
will help to determine a  definitive  standard of care for reducing pain and 
swelling following scleral buckle surgery that will allow reduced 
prescription of narcotics.  
4.0 Study Endpoints  
4.1 Describe the primary and secondary study  endpoints  
Primary Endpoint:  
• Statistically significant reduction in pain as measured by 11-
point Numerical Rating Scale at 1-day post-op. We are

8.0 Procedures Involved  
8.1 Describe and explain the study design.  
Randomized Control Trial. Subjects will be patients at Vistar Eye Center 
who are undergoing scleral buckle surgery for rhegmatogenous  retinal 
detachment. Patients of this indication will be consented and enrolled in 
the trial  as detailed in section 24 , and  randomized (by [CONTACT_314747] -flip) into one 
of two arms, the control or the experimental. Patients in both arms of the 
study will be screened for IOP via handheld digital tonometry  (tonopen)  
and will undergo standard scleral buckle procedures, including irrigation  
with 1 ml .75% Marcaine for local anesthesia  (as is standard for all 
surgeries ). At time of surgery, patients in the experimental group will 
receive irrigation of 1 ml (40 mg/ mL) triamcinolone around the  bed of  
applied scleral buckle  distributed  equally in all 4 quadrants  (.25 ml per 
quadrant) under the tenon layer of the eye . Patients in the control group 
will be given irrigation  around the applied scleral buckle  of 1 ml balanced 
salt solution instead of triamc inolone. Patients will be  masked to the 
treatment group assignment. The surgeon cannot be masked, as the 
triamcinolone solution is white and the balanced salt solution is clear. 
Intraoperative details will be recorded  in the EMR  about the surgery in 
both g roups, including duration of surgery, time of irrigation, any 
additional pharmaceuticals or anesthesia applied, procedures performed, 
and placement of the buckle.  Patient will receive a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -count form at the 
end of the visit to keep track of rescue analge sic consumption. All patients

VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 9 of 26 Revised: February 9, [ADDRESS_387300] -operative day one, p rimary outcome data will be obtained by  a 
blinded examiner who will be giving the patient a form which asks about 
the patient’s pain score by [CONTACT_314748] 11-point  numbered rating scale 
(0-10). On the same form, p atients will also be asked about post -operative 
nausea and vomiting for secondary endpoint , which will be scored from 0-
[ADDRESS_387301] regularly scheduled visit with the surgeon who will 
be screening the patient for success of surgery, adverse even ts, and will 
examine pain and nausea scores to ensure both are well controlled.  The 
physician will be ensuring the patient’s safety, and will be allowed to 
prescribe any medications deemed medically necessary for control of side 
effects, nausea, and pain. IOP of all patients will also be measured at this 
visit.   
At second post -operative visit (1 -2 weeks), patients ’ IOP will be measured 
again for safety endpoint.  Patient pi[INVESTIGATOR_314737].  
Patients will be filling out  11-point NRS pain score  and post-operative 
nausea and vomiting sheet again during office visit and it will be collected 
by [CONTACT_314749].  Patient will then be examined by [CONTACT_314750], adverse events, and control of pain and nausea .

All patients who present with indication for scleral buckle surgery are 
considered potential subjects.  
15.4 Describe materials that you will be use to recruit subjects. Attach copi[INVESTIGATOR_314739] n umber on each document .  
Recruitment script can be found attached . 
● Describe any compensation to subjects. Separate compensation in to 
appropriate categories, such as: reimbursement for expenses, time and 
effort, and additional incentives for study participation.  For each 
category, specify the amount (including any pro -rated amount), schedule, 
and met hod of payment.  
● $20 total compensation for completion of the study (will be disbursed after 
6 month follow -up phone call)  
 
16.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
16.1 Describe circumstances under which  you anticipate  subjects could be 
withdrawn from the research without their consent.

VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 16 of 26 Revised: February 9, 2019  • The research is canceled by [CONTACT_15927]  
• Patient is  unable to keep scheduled appointments  
• A patient has  a side effect that requires stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_142616]  
16.2 If applicable, describe any procedures for orderly termination  (e.g., 
discontinuation of a study drug or debriefing after a behavioral 
intervention) . 
N/A 
16.3 Describe procedures that you will follow  when subjects withdraw from the 
research, including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued 
data collection (e.g., partic ipant declines to continue with regular blood 
draws,  but continues with periodic behavioral questionnaires).  
If the patient withdraws consent to study before the time of surgery, the 
patient will not receive either the experimental or control treatments, and 
will receive standard surgical treatment. The patient’s data will not be 
extracted from the EMR for study purposes, and the patient will not be 
given any of the survey materials. If a patient withdraws consent after the 
surgery, the patient’s data will not be extracted from the EMR for analysis 
and the patient will be given no further survey materials. Existin g survey 
materials will be destroyed. If patient partially withdraws from procedures 
after surgery, the data may be used except for that which is not completed.  
17.[ADDRESS_387313] the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or 
inconveniences to the subjects related the subjects’ participation in the 
research.  
Adverse event data was collected by [CONTACT_252299] [ADDRESS_387314] been reported to occur in 20 -60% of patients.  Less 
common reactions occurring in up to 2% include endophthalmitis 
(infectious and non -infectious), hypopyon, injection site reactions 
(described as blurring and transient discomfort), glaucoma, vitreous 
floaters, and detachment of retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_314740], optic disc 
vascular disorder, eye inflammation, conjunctival hemorrhage and visual 
acuity reduced. Cases of exophthalmos have also been reported.  
Risk of infection : Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, 
and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased 
resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are 
Using Triamcinolone Acetonide to Reduce Pain after Scleral Buckle Surgery  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 17 of 26 Revised: February 9, 2019  used. Corticosteroids may enhance the establishment of secondar y 
ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. If an infection occurs during 
corticosteroid therapy, it will be promptly controlled by [CONTACT_314754] .  
Elevated Intraocular Pressure : Increases in intraocular pressure 
associated with triamcino lone acetonide injection have been observed in 
20-60% of patients. This may lead to glaucoma with possible damage to 
the optic nerve. Effects on intraocular pressure may last up to [ADDRESS_387315] our rate of elevated IOP to be 
much lower than that determined by [CONTACT_1622].  
Endophthalmitis : The rate of infectious culture positive 
endophthalmitis is 0.5%. Proper aseptic techniques will alway s be used 
when administering triamcinolone acetonide. In addition, patients will 
be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment should an 
infection occur.  
Cataracts : Use of corticosteroids may produce cataracts, particularly 
posterior subc apsular cataracts. As our study will be irrigating the sub-
tenon’s  space rather than injecting into the posterior capsule of the eye, 
we expect our rate of cataracts  to be much lower than that determined by 
[CONTACT_1622].  
Patients with Ocular Herpes Simplex : Corticosteroids should be used 
cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible 
corneal perforation. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular 
herpes simplex.  We will be excluding all patients with ocular herpes 
simp lex. 
 
Systemic reactions are exceedingly rare in ophthalmic administration of 
corticosteroids but are included below for completeness:  
Cardiovascular: Bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac 
enlargement,  circulatory collapse, congestive h eart failure, fat embolism, 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in  premature infants, myocardial rupture

treatment, insomnia, meningitis, neuritis, neuropathy, 
paraparesis/paraplegia,  paresthesia, sensory disturbances, vertigo  
Reproductive: Alteration in motility and number of spermatozoa.  
 
● Privacy (e.g., potential for personal information being accessed, used, 
or disclosed without the subjects’ knowledge or consent, breach of 
confidentiality/security)  
 
● In any clinical trial, there is a possibility for patient’s personal 
information being accessed improperly. This has been minimized as 
much as possible through participation in CITI training by [CONTACT_314755], as well as not extracting patient identify ing information 
from the EHR for analysis purposes.  
 
● Economic (e.g., potential for individuals to lose access to economic 
services, employment, insurability)  
● There will be no additional charge for T A treatment to the patient.  
17.[ADDRESS_387316] risks to the subjects 
that are currently unforeseeable. This will be rare, and usually applicable 
when testing a new drug or device or a new use of an existing drug or 
device.  
Using Triamcinolone Acetonide to Reduce Pain after Scleral Buckle Surgery  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 19 of 26 Revised: February 9, [ADDRESS_387317] when applied locally to the eye, but some risk exists 
nonetheless.  
17.4 If applicable, describe risks to others who are not subjects (e.g., collection 
of sensitive health data that might affect sexual partners if disclosed, 
mandatory reporting of abuse, DNA testing that might affect family 
members or r elationships).  
N/A 
18.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
18.1 Describe the potential benefits that individual subjects might experience 
from participating  in the research. Include the probability, magnitude, and 
duration of the potential benefits , as this will be usef ul to the IRB’s 
risk:benefit analysis . Do not include benefits to society or others. These 
should be included in section [ADDRESS_387318] 
likelihood and magnitude are  currently unknown, but  likelihood is  
presumed to be high based on background literature . Magnitude is 
presumed to be around 50% reduction in pain . Subjects may also 
experience a decrease in intraocular inflammation, and post -operative 
nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, patients may have a red uced risk for 
addiction to pain medication, as we hope to demonstrate a reduced need 
for post -operative analgesics following surgery. All patients in the 
experimental group will also be receiving the treatment at no additional 
cost to them, which is a pote ntial financial benefit.  
19.0 Data Management and Confidentiality  
19.1 Describe procedures that  you will use for quality control  to ensure validity  
of collected data.  
The surgeon will be including their subjective assessment of patient’s pain 
on the EHR, which they may compare to the patients written assessment 
as a form of quality control.  
19.2 Describe the steps that you will take to handle and secure study data 
during data collection, storage, use, and transmission.  Include 
information about training of study staff, authorization of access, 
Using Triamcinolone Acetonide to Reduce Pain after Scleral Buckle Surgery  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 20 of 26 Revised: February 9, [ADDRESS_387319] at 
Vistar Eye Center according to HIPAA regulations. Data that will be 
extracted from the EMR will not contain any patient identifying 
information. The procedure by [CONTACT_314756]. De -identified data extracted will be 
stored in a dataset along with arbitrary patient ID within the Vistar Eye 
Center computer network so that it cannot be accessed without both 
physical access and l og-in credentials. Access to study materials is granted 
only to 2 surgeons listed on this document  (John, McClintock) , and the 
research coordinator  (Vaidya) .  
19.3 For multi -site studies , describe how data or specimens will be handled 
and secured for each site  (e.g., central or disseminated data storage, data 
coordinating center ). 
19.4 Describe the plan for data disposition following the conclusion of the 
study (e.g., long term maintenance of data, data destruction methods) .  
Data will not be stored outside of that needed for medical care after the 
conclusion of the study. Medical information will continue to exist on the 
Electronic Medical Records at Vistar Eye Center, but all extracted data 
will be destroyed  [ADDRESS_387320] protocol.  
● What information will be included in the long term storage of data 
or specimens?  
● How long will the data or specimens be stored?  
● Where and how data or specimens will be stored?  
● Who will have access to the data or specimens  during long term 
storage ? 
● Who is responsible for receipt or transmission of the data or 
specimens?  
● How will data or specimens be shared or transported?  
● When and how will personal identifiers be destroyed?  
 
20.[ADDRESS_387321] subjects’ privacy interests. 
“Privacy interest” refers to a person’s desire to place limits on with whom 
they interact or to whom they provide personal information (e.g., 
collecting the minimal amount of private information required to  complete 
the study, protecting the data once it is obtained).   
No patient identifying information will be extracted from the electronic 
medical records. The only people with access to this information is the 
medical care team of the patient. De -identified  data will not be shared 
Using Triamcinolone Acetonide to Reduce Pain after Scleral Buckle Surgery  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 21 of 26 Revised: February 9, 2019  beyond the two surgeons involved in the study  design  and research 
coordinator . 
20.2 Describe steps that you will take  to make subjects feel at ease with the 
research situation in terms of the questions being asked and the 
procedures being performed. “At ease” does not refer to physical 
discomfort, but the sense of intrusiveness a subject might experience in 
response to q uestions, examinations, and procedures (e.g., use of a same 
gender investigator to place sensors on the torso , a private changing area 
if clothing must be changed, sensitivity when discussing  pregnancy test ing 
with subjects , making it clear o n surveys tha t participants  can discontinue 
at any time, not asking questions about private or sensitive issues unless 
necessary for the research ). 
20.3 Describe how you plan  to access existing sources of information about the 
subjects (e.g., medical records, grades) and ho w you will protect 
participant privacy through the data security plan.  
Data extraction from the medical record will be done by [CONTACT_314757].  The procedure by 
[CONTACT_314758]. De -identified data extracted will be stored in a dataset along with 
arbitrary patient ID within the Vistar Eye Center computer network . 
20.4 Describe a ny required reporting  that might  occur as a result of your 
research questions, study populations, and data collection methods. 
Examples for Virginia and Virginia Tech include:  
• Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40179] (e. g., circumstantial, disclosed) of child abuse (physical, 
emoti onal, sexual) and neglect  
• Sexual discrimination and/or sexual violence that involves a  student  
• Disclosure or signs of intention to harm oneself (i.e., suicidal ideation 
and/or plan)  
• Disclosure or signs of  desire to harm others (i.e. , homicidal ideation 
and/or plan)  
• Suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation of vulnerable adults (e. g., 
individuals with a disability, elderly persons ) 
 
21.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Safety monitoring  is required  when research involves greater than minimal risk 
and is sometimes appropriate for other studies . 
21.1 Describe:  
● The plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both 
harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe  (e.g.,  
periodic rep orting to the IRB , establishing a data monitoring 
Using Triamcinolone Acetonide to Reduce Pain after Scleral Buckle Surgery  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 22 of 26 Revised: February 9, 2019  committee , reporting data monitoring committee findings to the IRB 
and the sponsor ). 
 
The patient’s IOP will be measured at baseline prior to the surgery, 
as well as [ADDRESS_387322] two norma lly 
scheduled follow -up visits with the surgeon who will be monitoring 
for any other adverse events such as hypersensitivity or infection. If 
adverse events occur that may be related to the intervention, they 
will be reported to the IRB promptly. The data will also be 
monitored after every 10th patient completes the protocol for any 
statistically significant differences in the primary or secondary safety 
endpoints. If this occurs, it too will be reported to the IRB promptly.  
 
 
22.0 Compensation for Research  Related Injury  
22.1 If the research involves mo re than minimal risk to subjects, describe the 
available compensation in the event of research -related injury, if any.  
n/a 
22.[ADDRESS_387323] common for 
sponsored research . 
n/a 
23.[ADDRESS_387324] to make any additional visits.  
24.0 Consent Process  
24.1 Indicate the process by [CONTACT_314759] . Please  upload all consent, parental permission, and assent 
forms, documents, and scripts reference d in this section to Protocol 
Management.  
Describe the following:  
● Where the consent process will take place  (e.g., clinic waiting area, 
classroom, online)  
 
Using Triamcinolone Acetonide to Reduce Pain after Scleral Buckle Surgery  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 23 of 26 Revised: February 9, [ADDRESS_387325].  
 
● The time interval between  sharing the consent information with  the 
prospective subjec t and obtaining consent . For lab, interview, and 
focus group studies, the Virginia Tech IRB prefers that  subjects have 
at least [ADDRESS_387326] until 
the next day or longer still , giving the patient sufficient time to 
review the materials and change their decis ion to withdraw or 
provide consent by [CONTACT_314760].   
 
● If applicable, process es to ensure ongoing consent or assent (e.g., 
for multiple sessions; for research in which a minor will turn 18 
during the study; for longitudinal research with minors who will 
later be asked to provide or affirm their assent ). 
 
As there is no more than mini mal risk to the patient after the original 
intervention, we do not believe this is necessary.  
● Please review “SOP: Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP -
090)” for recommended procedure. Describe your process, being 
sure to include:  
o The name [CONTACT_314761] [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_42616]  
o [CONTACT_314762] M.D. (PI)  
o [CONTACT_32380] McClintock Jr. M.D.  
o Parth Vaidya, Medical Student, Research Coordinator  
o The time that will be de voted to t he consent discussion  
The consent discussion will be given up to [ADDRESS_387327]. The patient also has 
as much time as they need to review the consent documents 
before the start of  the surgery to decide to consent or not to.  
Using Triamcinolone Acetonide to Reduce Pain after Scleral Buckle Surgery  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 0 Page 24 of 26 Revised: February 9, 2019  o Steps that you will take  to minimize the possibility  of coercion 
or undue influence  
o The patient will be given a copy of the consent documents and 
allowed to review them at home and change their minds about 
wheth er they will be consenting to the study up until time of 
surgery. Patients will also be asked teach -back questions to 
ensure adequate understanding as listed in the consent script 
document.  
o Steps that you will take  to gauge or ensure the subjects’ 
understa nding  
o Patients will be asked 3 questions to gauge for understanding:  
a. What is the purpose of this study?  
b. What are the risks and benefits to participating?  
c. Are you required to participate in this study?  
25.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
25.1 Consult “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091)” for 
recommended procedures , and  describe whether and how consent of the 
subject will be documented in writing.  
25.[ADDRESS_387328] that the 
IRB waive the requirement to obtain written  documentation of consent 
(e.g., consent to participate is indicated by [CONTACT_7326] a button for an online 
questionnaire – after the consent information is presented and before the 
questionnaire begins).  
25.3 If you will document consent in writing, attach a conse nt document with 
places for signatures. If you will obtain consent, but not document consent 
in writing, please attach the consent script or text. Review “CHECKLIST: 
Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -411)” to ensure that 
you have provided suf ficient information. You should use “TEMPLATE 
CONSENT DOCUMENT (HRP -502)”to create the consent document or 
script.  
 
26.[ADDRESS_387329] the research . For example, as 
appropriate:  
● Describe t he PI’s availability to  supervise the research  
● The study was initiated by [CONTACT_978] (Vishak John) along with the 
research coordinator  (Parth Vaidya) and another surgeon (Michael 
McClintock Jr) , and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_314741]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_314742]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_314743] 1.0. 0 Page 25 of 26 Revised: February 9, 2019  often be in the same physical location as the surgeons on the 
research team and the patients, ensuring access.  
 
● Justify the feasibility of recruiting the required number of suitable 
subjects within the agreed recruitment period. For example, how 
many potential subjects do you have access to? What percentage of 
those potential subjects do you need to recruit?  
● There are 4 scleral buckle surgeri es done each month between the 4 
surgeons who will be conducting the operations . We would need to 
recruit 50% of them into the study in order to meet the recruitment 
period of 2 years. 
● Describe the time that you will devote to conducting and completing 
the research.  
This research project will not take much additional time as the 
majority of the time -consuming procedures are done anyway as 
standard of care. Additional time of 1 hour each week will be 
dedicated to consenting, answering questions, documentatio n, and 
statistical analysis.  
● Describe your process to ensure that all persons assisting with the 
research are adequately informed about the protocol, the research 
procedures, and their duties and functions (e.g., training plans, 
detailed study notebooks).  
● Each of the [ADDRESS_387330] the HRPP for multi -site research (i nvolving multiple institutions) and 
the details required for this section  will be  provided. Otherwise , indi cate N/A.

0016) between the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) of the [LOCATION_002] and the Child and Family Research Section (CFRS) within NICHD DIR.  At the CPSC, the Division of Human Factors (ESHF) examines products and toys for U.S. children and determines the appropriate age of their potential users based on a set of Guidelines last revised in 2002.  Due to the outdated nature of the [ADDRESS_293658] to inform these 
amendments.  The goal of the current study is to categorize traditional and contemporary children’s products and toys into age appropriate groups and use this information to rewrite the Guidelines for efficient CPSC  use.  
  Participants will be 3 60 parent -child  dyads from 6 months  to 12 years of age.   We will 
recruit equal number s of boys and girls from each of the following s ix developmentally 
determined and CPSC approved age groups :  6-11 mos, 12-18 mos, 19-35 mos, 36-71 
mos (3 -5 years), 72-107 mos (6-8 years), and 108-144 mos (9-12 years).  Participants will 
be tested at the CFRS once parental consent  and child assent have been obtained.   
 Each child will receive one of three counterbalanced children’s products or toys that are targeted to their age group from 6 of the 9 following categories: (1) Building or Construction (e.g., blocks, interlocking building materials), (2) Exploratory (e.g., clay, 
sand toys), (3) Games & Puzzles, (4) Instructional Toys (e.g., books, science kits), (5) 
Sports, Recreation, & Outdoor, (6) Imaginative Play (e.g., puppets, dolls, dress up 
materials), (7) Small Wheeled Vehicles (e.g., car toys), (8) Arts and Crafts, and (9) Musical Toys (e.g., musical instruments).  Children wi ll also receive one of three 
(counterbalanced ) children’s products or toys from each of the categories aimed at the 
age group below their age as well as another from each of the categories aimed at the age group older than their age. E ach child will first play alone and then  play with a parent.  
Different sets of toys will be presented  when children switch from playing alone to 
playing in a dyad.     Parents will provide information about their socioeconomic status and demographics.  They will also complete the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (i.e., an instrument assessing the child’s socialization, motor, communication, and daily living skills) and an age-appropriate instrument that assesses the child’s temperament.  They will provide information about toys that are already in their home.  Some parents may be invited to take part in a more in -depth qualitative  focus group interview about children’s toys.  All 
play sessions will be video recorded and will be scored for relevant behaviors.  We will examine differences in play with toys from the three age groups that are chronologically adjacent (i.e., to determine differences in outcomes for a given age group 
with age-appropriate toys compared to toys of the same category from the next youngest and next oldest age groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]).  Our outcome measures include the following: (1) Complexity of play, (2) Parts and features of toys used by [CONTACT_2252], (3 ) Duration of time

This observational study of children fits well with the CFRS program of research and the 
mission of the NICHD DIR.  We will investigat e children’s interactions with toys that 
surround children in their natural environment, as well as study how parents moderate 
child  play behavior.  Observing and quantifying behaviors during play will allow us to 
have a richer understanding of social and cognitive growth during different stages of 
child development in the context of toy play with parents and will form an empi[INVESTIGATOR_241823] [ADDRESS_293659] is  allocated through the IAG.

1. Introduction  
Overview  
From building a tower of blocks, to playing “house” with a doll, to sharing a 
game of checkers with a friend, children’s play has been described historically as a “leading source of development” (Vygotsky, 1967, p. 6) during childhood and is consistently implicated as a crucial component of children’s healthy cognitive and social growth (Bergen, 2002; Ginsburg, 2007; Scarlett, 2005; Trawick -Smith & Dziurgot, 
2011).  For example, essential skills of abstraction and symbolism are acquired through 
play (Vygotsky, 1967), and play during preschool is linked to long- term mathematics 
achievement later in school (Wolfgang, Stannard, & Jones, 2001).  
 Much of the time that children devote to play is with toys and other child-
directed products.  Parents and other consumers spend substant ial amounts on these items 
each year, with sales of toys and children’s products totaling $18.1 billion in 2014 (Toy Industry Association, 2014).  Moreover, this industry grows annually—revenues rose 4% between 2013 and 2014.   
With such a plethora of children’s products and toys available to U.S. consumers, 
how do American parents decide which toys are appropriate for their children?  Play progresses in complexity with child age.  As such, children’s product and toy needs during play are largely a function of their age and developmental stage.  A parent would not give a science kit to a 6-month-old, nor provide a rattle to a 10 -year-old.  However, 
many toy decisions are not as clear cut.   
In addition, children’s play with toys is influenced by [CONTACT_241844].  
Children’s play is more complex when playing with parents than when playing alone (Bornstein, Haynes, O’Reilly, & Painter, 1996; Bornstein, Haynes, Pascual, Painter, & Galperín, 1999, Cote & Bornstein, 2009; Damast, Tamis -LeMonda, & Bornstein, 1996).   
Children’s play with various types of toys and with a more advanced  play partner 
across development is important from scholarly and theoretical perspectives as well as  to 
policymakers and government stakeholders, such as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  In 1973, the CPSC was established to regulate consumer products, including toys, which may pose risks to U.S. consumers.  Before mechanical or chemic al 
testing is performed on toys to identify health hazards, the Division of Human Factors (ESHF) first determines the appropriate age group of potential users. ESHF staff members currently consult a rulebook known as the Age Determination Guidelines  
(2002), which has become outdated in light of developments in the children’s products and toy industry over the last [ADDRESS_293663] proposed is

  the outcome of an interagency agreement (IAG ; #CPSC -I-14-0016) between the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) of the [LOCATION_002] and the Child and 
Family Research Section (CFRS) within NICHD DIR.   
The importance of understanding children’s play with children’s products and 
toys at different ages is clear, but very little recent research has systematically investigated play behavior interactions between child age and type of toy.  Additionally, parent -child dyadic play with toys across different age groups is understudied.   The aims 
of the current project are two -fold:  (1) to add to the current body of knowledge on 
children’s play with different categories of toys at different ages alone and with a parent  
and (2) to provide information to the Consumer Product Safety Commission about children’s play with toys in the form of a revision of the [ADDRESS_293664] on U.S. children, their families, and current practices of the CPSC.   
 
Children’s Play with Different Types of Toys  
During play, much of children’s time is spent with  diverse products and toys, 
making these objects an integral part of children’s daytime activities  (Glassy & Romano, 
2003).  The  bulk of children’s toy play time involves constructing objects (Pellegrini & 
Gustafson, 2005) or manipulating these toys without any pretense involved (Gredlein & Bjorklund, 2005).  Although children’s products and toys are important elements of children’s play, basic research that rigorously and systematically investigates qualities of toys and documents the effects of these qualities on children’s play is surprisingly scant.  Furthermore, existing research that touches on the topic is outdated and includes only a few age groups.   
Kimmerle and colleagues (1995) demonstrated  that children begin to manipulate 
toys with increasing complexity between the ages of 7-13 months if the toy is lightweight, easy to grasp, and has moveable p arts that are accessible to infants’ small 
fingers.  For example, children showed the most advanced sensorimotor play using a barbell with a rotary knob at one end and a noisemaker at the other.  Likewise, one extensive study examined the qualities of toys and the ways that infants played with toys between the ages of 3 -12 months (Furby & Wilke, 1982).  Overall, the authors discovered 
that 12-month-olds preferred objects with movable pi[INVESTIGATOR_241824] 3-month-olds. McCall (1974) explored infant play behavior among 7 ½ to 11-month-olds and discovered that infants were more likely to attend to toys that were “responsive”.  Responsiveness included plasticity (how easily the object could be 
changed in shape through manipulation) as well as sound potential  (whether or not the 
object produced sounds when shaken).   
Responsiveness and detail of toys continues to hold importance later during 
childhood. Preschool children spent more time with a toy that provided random (instead of predictable) responses dependent  on the child’s input (Schulz & Bonawitz, 2005).  
Furthermore, responsiveness afforded by [CONTACT_241845] ‘talk’  when a button is 
pressed can foster  liking of the toy and rich engagement with it during play (Bergen &

  Davis, 2011; Kahn, Friedman, Pérez-Granados, & Freier, 2006), as well as enhanced  
learning  from the toy (C alvert, Richards, & Kent, 2014).  D etail of toys is also important 
to preschoolers, as Robinson and Jackson (1987) found that 4- year-olds, regardless of 
their gender, played longer with toy cars that were more realistic in their detail (working 
doors, painted with racing stripes and bright colors) than with cars with less detail (no working doors, painted with a dull brown color).   
 
An Ecological Model of Play 
In addition to the types of toys with which children play, a multitude of other 
factors affect s children’s play.  Bornstein (2006) proposed a model to outline the effects 
of these various elements on children’s play (see Figure 1).  The model illustrates that children’s play does not happen in a vacuum.  Rather, sociodemographics (e.g., socioeconomic status, cultural upbringing, schooling), characteristics of play partners (e.g., parent personality, parenting knowledge), and individual characteristics of the child (e.g., language, temperament, age) are interrelated and have profound effects on the ways in which children play.   
 
Figure 1.  Ecological Model of Play, taken from Bornstein (2006) 
 
 The two primary independent variables that will be manipulated in the 
experimental design of the proposed study are children’s age and the absence or presence 
of a parent play  partner.   The proposed project will also control for relevant aspects of 
children’s sociodemographic characteristics, partner individual characteristics, and the children’s individual characteristics by [CONTACT_241846].  
Children’s play differs with age.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_241825] (1962) long ago proposed three stages 
in the development of play—sensorimotor play , symbolic play , and games with rules , 
which still constitute a basic foundation for the progression of play throughout childhood.  To build on Pi[INVESTIGATOR_241825]’s stages, chronological age acts as an organizational framework for

  the following discussion of development of children’s play.  Our study of child play will 
extend from infancy (6 months) to middle childhood (12 years). 
Birth -2 years old.  During infancy and early toddlerhood, play entails 
manipulating objects for the purpose of exploring them (e.g., mouthing, fingering, hitting, shaking objects), as children examine the texture, shape, and functionality of toys (Kimerlee et al., 1995).  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_241826].  Although sensorimotor play nurtures cognitive and motor growth, it only lasts for a small part of childhood.   
When children engage in sensorimotor play, they perform circular actions , or the 
repetition of certain actions that are solitary and nonsocial (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_241825], 1962; Scarlett, 2005).  These circular actions become more complex with increasing age through infancy.  Between 4 -8 months of age children discover that certain activities with objects are 
enjoyable and will repeat these actions (e.g., grabbing a rattle and shaking it).  When children are between 8 -12 months old, they begin to use two objects at once (such as 
clappi[INVESTIGATOR_241827]) to play.  Finally, between 12-18 months, children engage in repetitive behaviors with objects and engage in trial and error, exploring new toys to see what types of new and interesting sounds and reactions they can create (Scarlett, 2005).     
Fenson and colleagues (1976) followed children’s toy play behaviors 
longitudinally between the ages of 7-20 months. Children in the earlier part of that age range (i.e., at 7 and 9 months old) tended to explore toys through touching, mouthing, shaking, and banging them.  However, between the ages of 13 and 20 months, more symbolic forms of play emerged (e.g., pretending to drink out of a cup in a tea set or eat something from a plate ; Fenson et al., 1976).   
Ages [ADDRESS_293665] as Fenson and colleagues (1976) discovered, as children approach 
the age of [ADDRESS_293666], and gestures can represent real -life actions.  During this play, the child is creating 
an “imaginative sphere” to express interpretations of the real world (Schousboe, 2013; p. 14).    
Beginning around the age of [ADDRESS_293667] before they are able to pretend with it (Elder & Pederson, 1978).  T hey also need 
to have seen another person perform that behavior, i.e., at this age, symbolic play is imitative (Scarlett, 2005).  Starting at about age 3, children are able to substitute objects for dissimilar objects  in their play (e.g., pretending to brush hair with a rubber ball).  
Finally, starting a round age 3½ years, children do not need toys to support pretend play.  
They are able to act as though an invisible object is in the play scene, when in reality, the object is not present  (e.g., believe that a princess is in the room ; Elder  & Pederson, 1978; 
Lillard, 2015).  Around ages 4-5, storylines with loose narratives, fantastical characters, and scenes emerge (Scarlett, 2005).  Symbolic play becomes more complex throughout the preschool years and peaks in prevalence around 4 years of age, starting to decline around the age of 6-7 (Eckler & Weininger, 1989; Trawick- Smith, 1998; Lilla rd, 2015).

page [ADDRESS_293668] during play (Scarlett, 2005).  During this age range, children are not as reliant on pretense and symbolism in their play.  Instead, they  
engage in games that have rules and regulations such as basketball or board games (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_241825], 1962).  One illustrative qualitative study examined how boys played soccer together.  Winther -Lindqvist (2013) found that playing games with rules was an integral 
part of how boys socialized and formed a community with one another.  Furthermore, understanding rules, such as who would be the judge, gatekeeper, etc. during the game was an essential part of how they played with one another. 
It should be noted that during this age range, children’s games still often contain 
elements of pretense.  For example, games with rules , such as Dungeons and Dragons, 
require players to create fantastical characters who exist in imaginary worlds.  Furthermore, s ymbolic play has been shown to continue until children are 11 years old 
(Smith & Lillard, 2012 ), and may occur in private settings away from observers to avoid 
the embarrassment of appearing too immature (Scarlett, 2005).  There are some benefits to continuing to engage in symbolic imaginary play in the elementary and middle school 
years.  For example, children may become better at controlling their emotions and improve their empathic understanding (Niec & Russ, 2002; Singer, 1994).   
 Children’s play with adult s.  Although children play alone, they often have play 
partners, such as parents, caregivers, siblings, and friends.  The effects of these 
companions on children’s play behavior are  large (Bornstein, 2006).  During the early 
stages of life, parents and other adult caregivers are children’s primary playmates.  Vygotsky (1967) recognized the importance of adults in children’s play, due to the adult’s ability to guide within the child’s zone of proximal development during play.  A task within the child’s zone of proximal development is one that the child has not yet mastered, but that becomes possible for him or her to achieve with the aid of a skilled other.  Vygotsky contended that, with the help of parents, children could advance in development through the use of scaffolding, or the careful guidance of adults during task execution  (Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976).  Indeed, sensitive fathers and mothers who 
engage in scaffolding during playtime have beneficial effects on children’s subsequent cognitive development (Tamis -LeMonda, Shannon, Cabrera, & Lamb, 2004).   
Consistent with this idea, when playing with parents, children play at more 
sophisticated levels because parents often prompt them to engage in more complex behaviors (O’Reilly & Bornstein, 1993).  For example, when using a standard set of toys, children are more likely to engage in more sophisticated  pretense play when collaborating 
with their mother than when playing alone (Bornstein et al., 1996; Bornstein et al., 1999, Cote & Bornstein, 2009; Damast et al., 1996).  In addition, non- parental adult play 
partners can scaffold  increases in the child’s level of play sophistication (Bornstein, 
Haynes, Legler, O’Reilly, & Painter 1997; Kwak, Bornstein, & Putnick, 2008; Trawick-Smith & Dziurgot, 2011).   
 
The Current Study  
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 13 of 37 
  The interplay among child age, toy type, and presence/absence of an adult play 
partner is complex, and adequate understanding of this interplay is lacking.  Most currently available research focuses on children of infant and preschool age, and less attention has been paid to children in the elementary and middle school years.  Furthermore, experimental designs that systematically compar e play with different toy 
types alone vs. with a parent across all stages of development do not exist .  Therefore, 
there are two main goals in the current study.  First, we aim to categorize traditional and contemporary children’s products and toys into age appropriate groups by [CONTACT_241847]’s play alone and with a play partner to enrich our theoretical understanding of play and how toys and parents mediate child play.  Second, the information derived from our empi[INVESTIGATOR_241828]’s 2002 Age Determination Guidelines  for children’s products and toys as part of this interagency 
agreement with the CPSC.  
 
2. Study Objectives   
a.  Primary objectives  
The primary objective of the current observational  study is to categorize traditional and 
contemporary children’s products and toys into age appropriate groups based on their intended use.  To do this, w e will examine differences in child play among toys from the 
three chronologically adjacent age groups to determine the differences in play f or a given 
age group with an age-appropriate toy in comparison with toys from the same toy category intended for the next youngest and the next oldest age groups.   
b. Secondary  objectives   
There are three secondary objectives of this research projec t:   
(1)  To determine how p lay group type (i.e., play alone, play with parent) affect s 
children’s play with toys. (2)  To determine how the qualities of toys differ depending on the manufacturer ’s suggested age. 
(3)  To determine how parents gauge age appropriateness  when making decisions 
about the types of products and toys to give to their children. 
 
3. Subjects  
 
a.  Description of study populations  
The participants  in our study are healthy volunteers.  P arents  and their children between 
the ages of 6 months to 12 years of age will be invited to participate .  All children  will 
need consent from their parent or legal guardian, and children over the age of 4 will need to provide assent.  Our accrual ceiling is 360 parent -child dyads (720 participants total).  
If participants withdraw, they will be replaced.   
 b.  Inclusion criteria  
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page [ADDRESS_293669] the inclusion criteria to determine the dyad’s eligibility.    
 While we want to make this study as inclusive as possible, our goal is to understand toy play for typi[INVESTIGATOR_241829].  Thus, the following bullet points explain why the following populations must be excluded from our study: 
• Children outside of the 6 month-12 year age range:  
These years cover early life and 
are the ages of interest for children’s play and are of central significance to the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission’s goals. 
• Families not fluent in English:   Fluency in English is essential for parents to be 
able to fill out surveys.  Families also need to be fluent in English so that they can comprehend verbal directions given by [CONTACT_241848].  If we included people who were not fluent in English, we would need  
many additional staff members who speak the multitude of languages of the 
diverse population of the Washington, D.C metro area to work with participants 
during the testing session and code t he videos after the testing session is complete . 
• Children who are sick, not typi[INVESTIGATOR_241830], born premature (if they are under 
24 months of age), blind, or deaf:   We must recruit a healthy sample of typi[INVESTIGATOR_241831] a full term pregnancy (if they are under 24 months of 
age) who are not blind or deaf for this project to remove any potential confounds 
that atypi[INVESTIGATOR_241832]’s play. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_241833], developmental delay or disability, dyslexia, PDD, ADD, ADHD, or ASD.  Including other 
populations such as deaf or blind children would require a different experimental 
set up, stimulus toys, and resources (i.e., someone who could convert our surveys 
to American Sign Language or Braille and could code the videos for the parent 
child behaviors during those sessions).   
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 15 of 37 
  • Children who are not adding to the ethnic and racial diversity of the sample:  The 
goal of our study is to recruit a sample  of subjects who are racially and ethnically 
diverse.  By [CONTACT_241849] a priority, we hope that our results will be 
applicable to the diverse populations residing within the [LOCATION_002].  To keep with this goal of a diverse and representative sample of children, we may have to exclude some families if we have already reached the quota of families from that 
particular racial or ethnic group. 
4. Study Design and Methods  
 
a. Study overview  
Participants  will be  childr en aged  6 months to 12 years and their parents .  Participants  
will receive children’s products or toys to play with during an hour play session.  Based 
on the manufacturer’s suggested age, s ome products will be geared towards children who 
are younger , some will be  geared  toward children their own age, and others will be aimed 
at older children.  Each child will first play alone and then play with a parent.  Different 
sets of toys will be presented when children switch from playing alone to playing in a dyad.  The play sessions will be videorecorded.  Video record s will subsequently be 
scored for children’s play  with the toys.   
 Participation in this project will take roughly 1-2 hours for the play session of the visit and approximately 1 additional hour for the parent to complete accompanying r elevant 
questionnaires, which can be done at home. Participation in the  study requires one visit to 
the CFRS lab . 
 This research is social and behavioral in nature, and the visits are considered outpatient.  Participants will be tested at the CFRS laboratory in Bethesda, MD.    Subjects who participate in this study are not required to participate in other protocols.  
b. Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited through the following methods:  
(1) Birth record s:  W e will purchase lists of local  addresses and phone numbers of 
families with  children. This recruitment procedure has been used in CFRS studies 
previously approved by [CONTACT_241850] (Study # 88- CH-0032; Study # 02- CH-
0278).  If we have only the family’s mailing address, a short letter or postcard describing the study will be mailed to each famil y, with an invitation to call or 
email the lab to learn more.  If the family’s tele phone number is available, we also 
may directly call families, provide a short description of the study, and ask if they would like to participate in the project.  
 (2) The local community:  We will contact [CONTACT_241851] .  We may contact:  
  
 
 
[CONTACT_194093] (2.5.15)    
    
page 16 of 37 
  • Newspaper s, magazines, local  community  publications 
 A short blurb of information with the CFRS  contact [CONTACT_241852]. 
• Neighborhood listservs, blogs, and online parenting communities on s ocial 
networking sites such as Facebook 
 A short blurb of information with the CFRS contact [CONTACT_241853]. 
• Schools, child care centers, and after-school programs 
 Directors may  post flyers or place informational flyers or 
brochures in children’s backpacks or mailboxes to take home to their parents.  
• Coffee shops, libraries, recreation centers , and other places known to 
attract parents and their children. 
 Flyers with detachable CFRS contact [CONTACT_241854]. 
 (3)  Prior participants in CFRS studies:  Families who have previously participated in other approved CFRS studies (e.g., 04- CH-0250, 03- CH-0069) and 
have provided their phone numbers will be re -contact[CONTACT_241855]. 
 (4)  NIH  websites  and recruitment hubs:  Those reading about the study on the 
Clinical C enter website, the Clinical Center Facebook or Twitter, the OPR 
Listserv, the Clinical Center Newsletter, ClinicalTrials.gov, ResearchMatch , and 
the CFRS website  and who contact [CONTACT_241856].  
 We anticipate that we will be able to recruit at a rate of [ADDRESS_293670] a short interview to 
check their eligibility criteria  (see the Intake Criteria checklist).  Parents who are eligible 
and interested in the study will receive the Informed Consent Form and surveys in the mail in paper format, which they will fill out and  return to  CFRS staff .  Surveys and 
consent forms may also be completed electronically on the Clinical Trials Survey System (CTSS).  
c. Study procedures  
Procedure  
Participants will be 720 parent s and their children from 6 months to 12 years of age.   We 
will recruit children divided into the following six age groups:  
• 6-11 mos 
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 17 of 37 
  • 12-18 mos (1-1.5 years) 
• 19-35 mos (1.5-2 years) 
• 36-71 mos (3-5 years) 
• 72-107 mos (6-8 years) 
• 108-144 mos (9-12 years) 
Each child will first :   
o Play alone 
then 
o Play with parent 
 
 
Each child in each age group will receive children’s products and toys from 6 of the 9 
following categories: 
(1)  Construction toys (e.g., blocks, interlocking building materials) (2)  Exploratory toys (e.g., clay, sand toys) (3)  Games & Puzzles  
(4)  Instructional toys (e.g., books, science kits) (5)  Sports, Recreational, & Outdoor Equipment (6)  Imaginative play toys (e.g., puppets, dolls, dress up materials) (7)  Small Wheeled Vehicles (e.g., car toys) (8)  Arts & Crafts toys  
(9)  Musical toys (e.g., musical instruments) 
-  Prior to testing, all toys used in this project will be inspected for safety hazards by [CONTACT_241857]. Toys will be inspected for small parts, mechanical hazards (cord length, magnet strength, etc.), lead, and phthalates. All small parts will be removed from toys for children under age 3, and toys will be replaced wi th similar 
ones if any mechanical hazards, lead, or phthalates are identified.  
-  There is a large body of research regarding children’s gravitation towards and play with sex -stereotyped toys (O’Brien & Huston, 1985; Caldera et al. , 1989).  Although 
child gender is an important factor to consider when studying the qualities of toys, the current study will use gender neutral toys as stimuli in an attempt to eliminate any potential gender confound.  
 The experimenters will select three representative target toys from each toy category.   
Target ages are determined by [CONTACT_3455]’s suggested age.  
• Children will be presented with one of three (counterbalanced)  toys 
target ed for their age group from 6 of the 9 toy categories.  
• When presented, each target toy will be paired with two additional toys from the same toy category : one targeted to the age group just below and 
one from the age group just above the target toy. 
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 18 of 37 
  • Children will receive novel sets of toys when switching from playing alone to play with parent. 
 To decrease the burden on parents  and their children, reduce unplanned missingness, and 
increase data quality, we are using a 3-form planned missingness  design.  Because of this 
design, parents and their children will on ly have to play with toys from 6 of the 9 
categories . 
 Parents and their children will be offered to take a break from playing approximately every 15 minutes during the toy play session in the event that they are tired of playing with the toys.  In addition, to ease frustration that can occur when transitioning from one toy type to the next, we will give children and their parents a couple of minutes notice before the transition occurs.    All play sessions will be video recorded.  Measures and Surveys:  
The following questionnaires will be sent to the parent to complete before the scheduled visit with the child.  Parents  can bring these documents with them to the scheduled visit 
or return them by [CONTACT_2319].  Although the surveys are currently in paper format, for ease of completion, we may convert them to electronic format that parents can fill out online through CTSS. These questionnaires include the following:   
• Consent form and permission to use videorecorded data.  
• Basic demographics about the child/family/home life, measuring:  Number/ages of children at home, birth order, parental age, parental education, parental marital status, race/ethnicity, etc. (see Bornstein et al., 1996). 
• Hollingshead Four-Factor Index of Social Status (Hollingshead, 1975):  Measures SES of the family.  
• Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS; Sparrow, Balla, & Cicchetti, 1984): 
Measures the child’s developmental level in a more sensitive way than by [CONTACT_241858]  
• Temperament through the use of validated scales for different age groups: Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ), Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ), Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ), Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire (EATQ) (see Bornstein et al., 2015; Rothbart, 2007). 
• Social Desirability Scale, Short Form (Reynolds, 1982):  A questionnaire used during self -reporting to detect and control for possible social desirability bias. 
• Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory (KIDI) for children < 2; or the Knowledge of Effective Parenting Scale (KEPS) for children ≥ 2: The KIDI  has 
been  previously approved by [CONTACT_241859] (Study# 88- CH-0032; 
Study # 02- CH-0278). The KIDI and the KEPS are designed to assess knowledge 
of parental practices, developmental processes, and infant norms, areas that form a knowledge base that may influence and regulate parental behavior vis-a- vis an  
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 19 of 37 
  individual child (MacPhee, 1981; Morawska, Sanders, & Winter, 2007).  The KIDI is appropriate for use with parents with children up to 2 years old and the instrument is comprised of 75 items covering four areas:  Norms  and Milestones, 
Principles (developmental processes), Parenting (strategies), and Health and Safety (guidelines).  The KEPS is appropriate for use with parents with children as young as 2 years old and is comprised of 28 items covering four areas:  Promoting Development, Principles of E ffecti ve Parenting, Using A ssertive 
Discipline, and Causes of Behavior Problems. 
• Knowledge of P lay (see Tamis -LeMonda et al., 1994):  A questionnaire used to 
asses s parent’s knowledge of children’s play, specifically, what types of play 
behaviors are more complex than others.   
• Parent Toy Questionnaire (PTQ):  Us es some new and some similar questions 
from a previous (2002) CPSC -sponsored study of toy play.  Parents would be 
asked:   “Where do you get information about toys?  Where do you buy your toys?   
What information do you gather about toys before purchasing them?  What is some information you wish that you had before purchasing toys?  
o Optional parent focus group:   If time and resources permit, we may 
invite a small number of parents to participate in a focus group conversation about toys. 
 The PTQ will ask parents to check a box if they are interested in this focus group opportunity.  We will only contact [CONTACT_241860]. 
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_241834] w ill elaborate on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_241835].  The focus group w ill give parents an 
opportunity to elaborate verb ally on their thoughts about age 
appropriateness of children’s toys and how they make their toy purchasing decisions.  This mixed methods research can supplement the quantitative data that parents provide in the PTQ.   
 The focus group may take place at the CFRS or we may use a phone conference call  for ease of scheduling. 
 
The following questionnaires will be completed  at the end of the testing session. 
• Perceptions of child’s comfort during testing situation, as reported by (1) the parent and (2) the experimenter  (Bornstein et al., 1999).  
• Questions adapted from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory (HOME; see Linver, Brooks-Gunn, Cabrera, 2004) to gather information about what toys are already at the child’s home and in  the 
child’s play environment.  
• Additional questions about the toys and their features, including the toys that the child played with during the testing session and additional toys of interest to the CFRS and the CPSC.  
Child questions 
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 20 of 37 
  • For children over the age of 4, we will ask children questions to assess what they thought of each  toy by [CONTACT_7939]: “How much did you like [toy]?  Why?” Children 
will respond to scaled items by [CONTACT_241861] a visual representation of a Likert-type scale in the form of smiley faces ( adapted from Harter, 1982; Richards & Calvert, 
2015).  
• We will also ask the child whether or not she/he ha s played with the toys before. 
 Video behavior coding 
Video records of the toy play session will be scored for certain qualitative and quantitative behaviors, including, but not limited to : 
• The Toy Quality Scale (TQS):  Qualities of the toy itself (i.e. , are there moving 
parts, does the toy make noise, how soft is the toy? Is it a branded toy with a licensed character on it?).  This coding system is being developed in CFRS. 
• Parts and features of toys used by [CONTACT_2252]. 
• Duration of time child spends with each toy. 
• When playing with parent, how often, in what way, and for how long does the child solicit the parent’s involvement?  How often, in what way, and for how long 
does the parent solicit the child’s involvement? 
• Level of Play  Complexity  (taken from Bornstein et al., 1996; Cote & Bornstein, 
2009, Suizzo & Bornstein, 2006): 
(0) default  (no play);  
(1) unitary functional activity  (e.g., throw the ball);  
(2) inappropriate combinatorial activity  (e.g., put the ball into a teacup): 
Was the toy used as intended or features of toy fully exploited? 
(3) appropriate combinatorial activity  (e.g., put the cup on the saucer);  
(4) transitional play  (e.g., put the telephone to the ear without speaking);  
(5) self -directed pretense  (e.g., drink from a cup);  
(6) other- directed pretense (e.g., pretend to feed the doll);  
(7) sequential pretense  (e.g., dial and speak into the telephone); and  
(8) substitution pretense  (e.g., pretend the block is a telephone receiver 
and speak into it).  
N 
ote that all of these procedures described above are solely for research purposes, not for 
medical or clinical evaluation or treatment.  Radiation is not used in this study. 
 There are no follow -up visits associated with this study.   The study has no relations to 
any other existing protocol.  
d. End of participation 
Because this is  a social and behavioral research  project, transfer of care to assure 
continuity, the provision of additional medical care, and sharing information with health care providers is not applicable.  When the project is complete, parents may request a summary of the findings from the study.  However, all findings from the study will be anonymized. 
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page [ADDRESS_293671] any possible negative feelings that could arise from families knowing their results (e. g., feeling inadequate as a parent because he or she did not score 
highly on the Knowledge of Effective Parenting Scale) or inappropriate use of the data by [CONTACT_192386] (e.g., using the score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale as part of a school entrance exam).   If parents request a video of their session, we will not distribute a 
copy to them until the study is over.  Parents must provide a written request for the video.  We will not distribute the videos to parents until the completion of the study to guard against their  sharing it with friends, neighbors, on social media , etc.  O ther people who 
view the video through these outlets could potentially be come participants in the study 
without our knowledge.  If these people ever do become participants, already having watched  a video like this could confound their results and  behaviors, weaken ing the 
scientific integrity of the study.  
   
5. Management of Data and Samples  
 a. Storage  
Data will be stored according to NICHD and NIH policy.  We will not collect any specimens or samples.  All data will be stored permanently in an archival database by [CONTACT_7681] .  They will be retained for analysis in perpetuity.   The 
Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_241836]’ records after completion of the study.    
 In addition, data may be stored in a password- protected database via CTDB.  For 
statistical analyses, data will be de-identified according to the Privacy Act, and when possible, by [CONTACT_21129] 18 HIPAA identifiers.  If a limited dataset is needed (for example to include dates), a user agreement will be executed.  Only investigators or designees authorized to use CTDB will have access to the data.    The anonymity and rights of the study's participants and their families will be fully protected. The full proper names of participants will not appear on the video record or questionnaires, although it is possible that a child’s first name [CONTACT_241876]. A ll data will be tallied and analyzed w ithout reference to  
individual names.   Child participants will be assigned ID numbers at the outset of the study, and the key linking the ID numbers with the participants’ identity, as well as digital video records of the children filmed  during the testing session, will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in a 
locked room when no researchers are present at the CFRS laboratory.  ID numbers are 
linked with personal identifying information, and only the clinical site investigators or designees have access to it.  The linkage is critical to interpretation of the d ata, as data 
will be compared across subject groups.  No one other than members of the research team will have access to th is linkage data without the explicit consent of the volunteer adult.   
 
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page [ADDRESS_293672] the scientific integrity of the study will be reported to the IRB as an unanticipated problem.  
b.  Data  (if applicable : including genomic data) and sample sharing plan 
At this time, we do not have any approved collaborators, but anticipate this in the future. Other investigators (both intramural and extramural to the NIH) may wish to study these data. Before sharing the data approved outside collaborators, we will submit an amendment with specific information about the other investigators/institutions and what data/samples will be shared.   IRB approval will be sought prior to any sharing of data.   
 The broad public sharing of data generated by [CONTACT_241862]. Data generated by [CONTACT_241863].  This study will be registered on our NICHD Intramural website (https://science.nichd.nih.gov/confluence/display/cfr/Home ) along with the above 
justification.  
 A
ny use of this data by a secondary party after submission to a designated repository 
must be shared by [CONTACT_241864]. Secondary parties must adhere to the NIH Human Data Sharing guidelines for broad data sharing and to the limitations for use set forth by [CONTACT_241865].  Access to identified data for secondary research will only be granted after 
IRB review or OHSRP clearance, as applicable.  
 Any publications and presentations authored or co-authored using data generated by [CONTACT_241866]. The repository(s) and funding source will also be acknowledged in any publications and presentations.   6. Additional Considerations  
 a. Research with investigational drugs or devices  
This provision is not applicable to our research.  We will not be using investigational 
drugs or devices.  
b. Gene therapy  
This provision is not applicable to our research.  We will not be using gene therapy. 
 
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 23 of 37 
  7. Risks and Discomforts 
Participation in this study involves minimal risk .  The probability and magnitude of harm 
or discomfort anticipated with the research are not greater in and of themselves than those 
ordinarily encountered in daily life.  We will minimize risk by [CONTACT_241867].  It is possible that while completing the 
questionnaires, participants may find that some questions touch on areas of personal sensitivity and may experience discomfort  when answering the questionnaires.  P arents  
and children may decline to answer any question.   All procedures are non-invasive. Previous work conducted in the CFRS reassures us that, 
while some  parent s may initially feel slightly self -conscious while being observed 
(perhaps more so when being filmed), in a short period of time they relax  and enjoy being 
involved in a study that focuses on their child and his or her development. Parent s will be 
assured that if the ir child becomes distressed by [CONTACT_241868], the session will be 
interrupted and she will be allowed to soothe the child and resume any caregiving responsibilities.  
 8. Subject Safety Monitoring  
We will monito r the play room and end the play session if a child engages in a potentially 
dangerous action.  Because this is social and behavioral research, we wil l not use toxicity 
tables, etc. for subject safety monitoring.  Participating in this study is voluntary , and 
participants may withdr aw at any time without penalty.  At the time of the play session, 
we will ask each child if s/he would like to play with toys .  If a child  says that they do not 
want to play, or decides in the middle of the study that they want to play no longer, the child will be allowed to w ithdraw without penalty .  Parents may also elect to stop their 
own or their child’s participation in the study at any time.  9. Outcome Measures  
 a. Primary outcome measures  
The primary study outcome s are the video -coded measures of age-appropriateness and 
play complexity.  We will examine differences in the mean scores of play among toys from the three age groups that are chronologically adjacent  (i.e., the differences in 
outcomes for a given age group with the age-appropriate toy in comparison with toys from the same toy category just below and just above that age group).  
b. Secondary outcome measures  
Our other secondary outcome measures include the following: 
• Parts and features of toys used by [CONTACT_2252] 
• Duration of time child spends with each toy 
• Child preference for the toys based on child-report ( smiley face Likert scale ) 
• Number of times and duration of time the child solicits the parent’s or friend’s involvement during play  
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 24 of 37 
  10. Statistical Analysis  
 
a. Analysis of data/ study outcomes 
For our primary outcome measure, our independent variables will be  the age group for 
which the toy is aimed  (younger vs. age-appropriate vs. older; within- subject) and the age 
group of the child (6 groups; between-subject), and our dependent variables will be the 
video-coded measure s of play .  The statistical methodology that we will use to analyze 
this question is a repeated -measures ANCOVA with up to five covariates.  Our five 
covariates include the following: (1) toy characteristics, (2) child temperament, (3) family socioeoconomic status, (4) child preferences for the toy , and (5) parenting knowledge.   
 For our secondary outcome of interest (how children play alone vs. with parent), we will conduct another repeated -measures ANCOVA with condition (alone vs. with parent)  and 
designated toy age (younger vs. age-appropriate vs. older) as within -subject factor s and 
child age (6 groups) as a between -subject factor.   Again, our dependent variables will be 
the video- coded measure s of play.  We will also use the same five covariates mentioned 
above:  (1) toy characteristics, (2) child temperament, (3) family socioeconomic status, (4) child preferences for the toys, and (5) parenting knowledge.      Both of the repeated -measure s ANCOVA designs will also be employed when we 
examine the dependent variables of secondary interest noted in section 9b, such as parts 
and features of toys used by [CONTACT_2252], duration of time child spends with each toy, child preference for the toys based on child- report (smiley face Likert scale), and the number 
of times and duration of time the child solicits the parent’s  involvement during play.  The 
independent variables mentioned above would remain the same.    
 We do not have any planned interim analysis.  Our criteria for significance is alpha = .05.  Due to the protocol’s design, unplanned missingness will be low.  Missing data procedures, such as Full Information Maximum Likelihood and Multiple Imputation, wil l 
be used.    
b.    Power analysis  
For our primary research question, a power analysis revealed that [ADDRESS_293673] designated toy ages (younger vs. age-
appropriate vs. older) is sufficient to detect a medium effect ( f = .25) for between-subjects 
and within- subjects effects and their interactions in a RM -ANCOVA with 5 covariates 
(power = .80 and alpha = .05).    For our secondary research question, a power analysis revealed that [ADDRESS_293674] conditions (alone vs. 
with parent), and [ADDRESS_293675] designated toy ages (younger vs. age-appropriate vs. older) is sufficient to detect a medium effect ( f = .25) for within - and between -subject 
effects and their interactions in a RM -ANCOVA with 5 covariates (power = .80 and 
alpha = .05).   
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 25 of 37 
   
For both our primary and secondary research questions, our five covariates include the 
following: (1) toy characteristics, (2) child temperament, (3) family socioeoconomic status, (4) child preferences for the toys, and (5) parenting knowledge.  Subject d ropouts 
will be replaced with other comparable subjects who complete the protocol.    11. Human Subjects Protectio n 
 a. Subject selection  
Participants of any race, ethnicity, sex, nationality, religion, and handedness may participate.  Approximately equal numbers of male and female children will be recruited, 
and to the extent possible, the sample will be racially and ethnically diverse.    However, we must exclude the following populations: 
• Children outside of the 6 month-12 year age range:  These years cover early life 
and are the ages of interest for children’s play and are of central significance to 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s goals. 
• Families not fluent in English:   Fluency in English is essential for parents to be 
able to fill out surveys.  Families also need to be fluent in English so that they can comprehend verbal directions given by [CONTACT_241848].  If we included people who were not fluent in English, we would need  
many additional staff members who speak the multitude of languages of the 
diverse population of the Washington, D.C metro area to work with participants during the testing session and code the videos after the testing ses sion is complete.  
• Children who are sick, not typi[INVESTIGATOR_241830], born premature (if they are under 
24 months of age), blind, or deaf:   We must recruit a healthy sample of typi[INVESTIGATOR_241831] a full term pregnancy (if they are under 24 months of 
age) who are not blind or deaf for this project to remove any potential confounds 
that atypi[INVESTIGATOR_241832]’s play. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_241833], developmental delay or disability, dyslexia, PD D, ADD, ADHD, or ASD.  Including other 
populations such as deaf or blind children would require a different experimental 
set up, stimulus toys, and resources (i.e., someone who could convert our surveys 
to American Sign Language or Braille and could code the videos for the parent child behaviors during those sessions).   
• Children who are not adding to the ethnic and racial diversity of the sample:  The goal of our study is to recruit a sample of subjects who are racially and ethnically diverse.  By [CONTACT_241849] a priority, we hope that our results will be applicable to the diverse populations residing within the [LOCATION_002].  To keep 
with this goal of a diverse and representative sample of children, we may have to

    Laura Bradley, B.A., University of Pennsylvania     Marc H. Bornstein, Ph.D., NICHD 
 All Associate Investigators have extensive resear ch 
experience designing experiments, working with minors, 
collecting data, analyzing data, and writing research reports.  [CONTACT_174128] , [CONTACT_241877], and [CONTACT_241878]’s protocol 
related duties will not include obtaining consent from patients.  They will only engage in analysis of de-identified data.

  a research laboratory.  IRTAs will be trained thoroughly in the methods of the protocol. 
 Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_241837].    The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_241838] 25 (Training requirements for the NIH Human Research Protections Program) will have completed all required training  
before starting work on the protocol.  12. Anticipated Benefit  
This study does not offer direct benefit to participants but will yield generalizable knowledge about how to categorize traditional and contemporary children’s products and toys into age appropriate groups.  The age determinations based on this research that are made by [CONTACT_241869] a large and generalizable impact on U.S. children, their families, 
and the current practices of toy manufacturers and the CPSC.  First, the changes made to the CPSC Guidelines based on the results of this study will have a large impact on how the CPSC determines the age appropriateness of childr en's products and toys.  In 
addition, manufacturers of children's products and toys adhere to the CPSC Guidelines when determining what target age to label on packages of their products.  Finally, U.S. Consumers of these goods are steered in their purchasing decisions of these products based on the age labels on the toys.  13. Classification of Risk  (for the study as a whole)  
For the child participants, this project is classified under 45CFR46.404; it does not involve greater than minimal risk to children. The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated with the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life.   For our adult (parent) participants, this study does not involve greater than minimal risk. It is possible that some participants may find that some of the questions touch on areas of personal sensitivity and experience discomfort.  Participants can decline to answer any question.  No invasive procedures or interventions are involved.    
 
d. Overall risk and benefit consideration  
The less than minimal risk involved in this project is reasonable in relation  to anticipated 
benefit.  The benefit  of this study lie s in the extension of knowledge of how to effectively 
categorize children’s toys in the U.S. for parents into age appropriate categories , leading 
to a safer consumer market for children and their families.  
 14. Consent Documents and Process  
 a. Designation of those obtaining consent 
  
 
 
CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page 28 of 37 
  Study investigators designated as able to obtain consent in S ection # 11f above will obtain 
informed consent.  All study investigators obtaining informed consent will have 
completed the NIMH HSPU ‘Elements of Successful Informed Consent ’ training.  Verbal 
or written a ssent will be obtained from minor subjects over age 4 . 
 
b. Consent procedures  
Permission for participation of minors will be obtained from parents/legal guardians.  Parents  will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask 
questions regarding the study prior to signing.  After the consent form has been filled out and parental permission  is obtained, the parent and child may begin participation in the 
study.    Permission f rom only one parent is being requested.  The permission of one parent is 
sufficient for compliance with 45 CFR 46.404, as the proposed research poses risk no greater than that ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests (i.e ., minimal risk) .  
 At the time of the play session, CFRS staff  will also obtain assent from the children to 
ensure that they want to participate in the study as well.  Parents will be present during the assent process and will sign the bottom of the assent form to certify that they witnessed their child’s assent.   
 
Children between the ages of 4-5 will provide verbal assent.   Researchers will sign the 
form  to certify that they received assent from the participant.   Language for verbal assent 
will be as follows:  
“We are doing this project because we want to know more about how kids play w
ith toys.  If you join in, you will play with some toys.  My friend here is going to 
use a camera to make a video of you while you play with the toys.  Nobody will see the video except people who work with us, and we will keep the video private by [CONTACT_241870] a locked room.  Then, I will ask you some questions.  You might like playing with these toys, but you might not like it.  If you do not want to play with them, you do not have to.  We will get to learn about what kids like and how they think if you will help us.  You will also get to play with some toys.  If you do not want to play anymore, you do not have to.  Just tell me if you do not want to play anymore!  If you decide you want to stop, you can leave— I will not be upset.  
Anything that you say to me will be safe.  Do you have any questions?  Would you like to do this? ”  
 
Children over the age of 6 will be read the same statement and will be asked to sign a 
written assent  form to indicate their willingness to participate .   
 
c. C
onsent documents  
The consent form contains all required elements of information needed to understand the goals and procedures of the study and will use the language set forth in the NICHD

CNS IRB Protocol Template (2.5.15)    
    
page [ADDRESS_293682] 
access to the data without the explicit consent of the participant adult.  We will do everything we can to keep outsiders from learning about families’ participation in this study.  To further help us protect their  privacy, we will obtain a 
Certificate of Confidentiality from the [LOCATION_002] Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  With this Certificate, we cannot be forced (for example by [CONTACT_193689]) to disclose information that may identify subjects  in any federal, state, local, 
civil, criminal, legislative, administrative, or other proceedings.  The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify participants,  
except to prevent serious harm to themselves  or others. 
 20. Confidentiality  
 a. For research data and investigator medical records  
Child participants will be assigned ID numbers at the outset of the study.  The key linking the ID numbers with the participants’ identity  and videos taken of the children will be 
kept in a locked filing cabinet  in a room that is locked when unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_530].   
 Electronic d ata will be kept in  password- protected computers  and servers.  Only study 
investigators will have access to the samples and data.  Data collected on paper wil l be de-
identified through the use of the ID number assigned to the participant at the outset of the study.  Data collected on paper will be entered into electronic spreadsheets.  All participant identifying data except for subject numbers will be removed from these spreadsheets.    In addition, parents will have the option of indicating on the consent form whether or not they will allow the use of short video clips of themselves and their child at professional presentations and conferences.  Parents may  contact [CONTACT_241875], both during or after the study.    Subject confidentiality will be maintained to the greatest extent possible.  Research results will be labeled using a unique code.  Publications will not include subject names nor will they contain personal identifying information.

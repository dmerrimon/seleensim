2.1 Preface  
Falls and other abnormalities of gait and balance are common in Parkinson’s disease (PD ), are largely 
levodopa unresponsive, and are major contributors to morbidity and mortality. The central theme of the U niversity of M ichigan  Udall Center is that degeneration of basal forebrain (BF) and 
pedunculopontine (PPN) cholinergic projections, in the context of degraded striatal motor control, 
contri butes significantly to PD gait and balance deficits. Our preclinical work identifies attentional 
deficits, secondary to loss of cortical cholinergic afferents, as a key mechanism through which 
cholinergic deficits contribute to impaired gait and balance. The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_737212]/pharmacodynamic clinical study is to assess α4β2* nicotinic cholinergic receptors 
(nAChRs) as a therapeutic target for improving gait, balance, and attentional capacity in PD.   
 
To demonstrate the α4β2
* nAChRs are appropriate therapeutic targets inPD, it is necessary to study 
key pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic features of α4β2* nAchR in the context of the degenerating, 
hypocholinergic PD brain, a pathologic environment in which they may exhibit unique features.  Thi s 
personalized medicine approach focuses our studies on hypocholinergic PD subjects.  We will assess α4β2
* nAChR features using Positon Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with the α4β2* nAChR 
ligan d [18F]flubatine, subacute administration of the α4β2* nAChR partial agonist varenicline (VCN), 
and laboratory measures of gait, balance, and attention.  We will perform a pharmacodynamics study with subacute VCN administration to determine if α4β2
* nAChR stimulation improves laboratory 
measures of gait function, postural control, and attentional function in hypocholinergic PD subjects.  
 
2.2 Scope of the analyses 
These analyses will assess the efficacy and safety of  varenicline  in comparison with placebo, 
addressing the primary  and secondary objectives of the study.

  4 Study Methods  
 4.1 General Study Design and Plan  
This study is a single -center, randomized placebo- controlled double -blind crossover study of VCN in  
participants with PD to assess its effects on measures of gait, balance, and cognition.   Participants 
were randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment sequences:  placebo followed by [CONTACT_737218] 0.[ADDRESS_1007096] treatment period  (week 3 [day 22]) , 
at end of the washout period- beginning of the second treatment period (week 6 [day43]) , and at the 
end of the second treatment period  (week 9 [day 64]).  
 
The schema below describes the main elements of the study design:  
 
 
 
 
4.2 Inclusion -Exclusion Criteria and General Study Population  
 4.2.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1. PD diagnosis will be based on the [LOCATION_008] Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Research Center ([LOCATION_006]PDSBRC) clinical diagnostic criteria. We will enrich the cohort by [CONTACT_737219] 2 or higher, duration of mot or disease 5 
years or longer, age >[ADDRESS_1007097] 
distinctive clinical profiles, like vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, early and severe 
dysautonomia or appendicular apraxia, which may differentiate them from idiopathic PD. The 
use of the [LOCATION_006]PDSBRC clinical diagnostic criteria for PD will  mitigate the inclusion of subjects 
with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_737213] [
11C]DTBZ PET to confirm striatal 
dopaminergic denervation.  
2. Subjects on neuroleptic, anticholinergic (trihexiphenidyl, benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), or cholinesterase inhibitor drugs.  
3. Current or previous (within last 6 months) use of any product or medication containing nicotinic agents, including use of tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], chewing tobacco, 
etc., e - cigarettes, OTC nicotine  patches, chewing gum containing nicotine, or varenicline.  
4. Evidence of a stroke or mass lesion on structural brain imaging (MRI).  
5. Participants in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is contraindicated including, but not 
limited to, those with a pacemaker, presence of metallic fragments near the eyes or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], 
or cochlear implant.  
6. Severe claustrophobia precluding MR or PET imaging  
7. Subjects limited by [CONTACT_737220].  
8. Pregnancy (test within 48 hours of  each PET session) or breastfeeding.  
9. Significant risk of cardiovascular event.  

Udall P3E3 SAP version 1.0 01AUG2019 Page 6 of 11 10. Active, significant mood disorder.  
11. History of seizures.  
12. Active alcohol abuse.  
 
4.3 Randomization and Blinding  
Participants were randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment sequences: placebo followed by [CONTACT_737218] 0.[ADDRESS_1007098] who dispensed the appropriate study medication. To mask drug, VCN pi[INVESTIGATOR_737214].  
 4.4 Study A ssessments  
 4.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment s 
Two co -primary end points were selected:   a measure of  postural stability  and gait function.  
JERK is the time-based  derivative of lower trunk accelerations during standing spontaneous sway.  
JERK was chosen because  it tracks postural instability in PD  [1]. Normal pace gait speed with no 
distractors was chosen as prior studies indicated that neocortical cholinergic denervation is associated 
with slower gait speed in PD  [2].  We hypothesized that VCN treated participa nts would ambulate 
faster and that VCN treatment would reduce JERK.   
 Postural stability was assessed with the Ambulatory Parkinson's Disease Monitoring (APDM) wearable sensor system (APDM Wearable Technologies, Inc.) using the iSWAY protocol, with partic ipants standing on a foam pad with eyes open and eyes closed. Standard postural measures, 
including JERK, were assessed and calculated using the manufacturer’s software (Mobility Lab Version 1).  Gait analysis was performed on an 8- meter  GAITRite pressure sensitive walkway (CIR 
Systems, Inc.) and standard parameters were analyzed using ProtoKinetics Movement Analysis Software (GAITRite version 5.09C; ProtoKinetics, LLC). Gait assessments were repeated with a dual -
task protocol in which participants counted backwards by [CONTACT_737221] a random number (under 100) provided by [CONTACT_4921].    
 4.4.[ADDRESS_1007099] (SAT), established to reflect CNS cholinergic systems function in humans [3, 4, 5] .  The SAT is performed with 2 conditions:  without 
and with a distractor (dSAT).  SAT and dSAT results are reported as the vigilance index, a measure that corrects estimates of accurate detection with penalties for false detections and not confounded by 
[CONTACT_737222]  [6].  SAT was selected as the second end point.  
 
4.4.3 Exploratory Efficacy Assessments  
Additiona l assessments of postural control, gait function and attentional function were measured as 
exploratory end points.  Cognitive assessments were also measured for exploratory analyses.  
 Motor Assessments:  Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, part III 
(MD -UPDRSIII; “on” state); MDS -UPDRSIII postural instability and gait subscore (PI[CONTACT_86467]) subscale 
score (sum of items 3.1, 3.9 -3.13); Gait Speed (normal pace); Gait Speed (fast pace); Gait Speed 
(normal pace - dual task); Gait Speed (fast pace – dual task); Postural stability measures – mean sway 
velocity, JERK, root mean square sway distance (RMS).  To assess the effects of attentional loading, normal pace and fast pace gait were performed under dual task conditions.   Dual task condi tions 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_737215].  Differences in gait speed between dual task and no dual task 
conditions are a measure of the attentional burden imposed by [CONTACT_737223].  To assess the effects of 
VCN on this aspect of gait performance, we compared the differences between no dual task and dual task gait speed between VCN and placebo treatment periods.   We used the APDM system’s iTUG 
Udall P3E3 SAP version 1.0 01AUG2019 Page 7 of 11 (Timed Up and Go) protocol to collect additional exploratory data.   
 
Cognitive Assessments: For cognition, we used a general cognitive measure, the MoCA and selected 
tests to examine major cognitive domains but focusing on attention and executive function.   MoCA; 
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -III Digit Symbol modalities test; CVLT short term memory test; 
CVLT lon g term memory test; CVLT recognition test; D -KEFS Stroop III; D -KEFS sorting total; D -
KEFS verbal fluency letters total; D -KEFS verbal fluency animals; D -KEFS Trail Making Test 4; 
JOLO test.   
 Behavioral Assessments:  GDS  
 
5 Sample Size  
The sample size (planned initially at four participants per dosing group) for the VCN - α4β2*  nAChR  
occupancy study was based on logistical considerations.  For the Crossover study, we calculated that 
[ADDRESS_1007100] 80% power to detect within- patient treatment differences of 
0.122 m/s in gait speed and -0.131 m2/s5 for JERK, assu ming within -participant correlation of > 0.64 
and > 0.72, respectively, using a paired t -test and a two -sided Type I error of 0.025 (Bonferoni 
adjustment for co -primary endpoints).  This approach is conservative given our analysis method uses 
mixed effects models. Estimates for treatment differences were based on Bohnen et al. [2] for normal 
pace gait speed and Mancini et al. for JERK  [7].

statistical analysis plan  document was finalized prior to the database lock and unblinding.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1007102] disposition.  
 6.2.1 Intention to Treat  Population  
The main analysis set for efficacy is the intention to treat (ITT) population, defined as all participants 
randomized .  
 6.2.[ADDRESS_1007103] one dose 
of study drug.  The Safety Population will be used for all safety analyses, as well as demographic and 
baseline analyses.  
 
6.3 Covariates and Subgroups  
There are a limited number of covariates that will be incorporated in statistical models in our analyses 
because of the relatively small sample size in each treatment group:  the baseline outcome measure .  
We will not impute missing values for ba seline covariates. 
  6.4 Missing Data  
We will summarize the extent of missing data over time for the primary end point s.  We will 
Udall P3E3 SAP version 1.0 01AUG2019 Page 8 of 11 investigate the missing data mechanism (missing at random, not missing at random), which is 
important for the validity of our analytic approaches, through exploratory analysis. Exploratory analyses will include plots of the mean profile of end points  at weeks 0, 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1007104] complete data throughout the study and those who don’t . 
 The primary analysis of the primary end points assumes a missing at random mechanism.  If data are 
not missing at random, we will use a multiple imputation approach  within the pattern -mixture model 
framework  [8].  The imputation model s, applied sequentially for each missing data pattern,  will 
include baseline value , treatment group,  and demographic variables (age and gender), allowing for the 
dependence of later time points on earlier time points .  If there are issues with over -fitting, the 
demographic variables will be omitted.  The analysis model will include the same covariates used in 
the primary analysis of the primary end point s and will incorporate the uncertainty due to imputa tion 
in the calculation of the standard error, as described by [CONTACT_11369] [9]. 
 6.[ADDRESS_1007105] (DSMB) that reviewed the pooled and by- treatment subject 
disposition, study conduct and safety data approximately every 6 months.   
 
6.6 Multiple Testing  
Two-sided p -values will be reported.  For the co -primary endpoints, a Bonferonni adjustment for 
multiplicity will be  applied.  For all other endpoints , no adjustments for multiplicity will be made.  
Thus, p- values for secondary and exploratory outcomes will be interpreted with caution (note that this 
is a departure from the protocol) .  Means and standard errors will be provided to summarize treatment 
differences for efficacy end point s. 
 
7  Summary of Study Data  
Descriptive summary statistics will be derived for all data at baseline, separately by [CONTACT_726312].  For efficacy, exploratory and safety data, data will be presented by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Treatment group will be characterized as “ Varenicline” and “Placebo”; for 
pooled summaries, “Overall” will be used as the column heading.  All tables will be annotated 
with the total population size relevan t to that table/treatment, including any missing observations.  
 
For continuous variables, mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum will be reported.  For categorical variables, number and percentages will be reported  
(excl uding missing values) .  Graphical methods will be heavily used in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_737216].

error (SE).  The co -primary endpoints will be  tested at the 2 -sided, 0.025, signific ance level. All other 
tests will be  based on a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05; no adjustments  will be made  for additional 
multiple comparisons.   Primary , secondary and key efficacy endpoints  will be  analyzed in all 
randomized participants (intention- to-treat [ITT] population)  and in the Compliant P opulation .  
 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed for UPDSR -III total and PIG subscale scores, where 
baseline degree of total cortical cholinergic denervation (from PET scans) and baseline degree of 
striatal dopamine denervation (from PET scans) were incorporated as covariates in separate models.   
These models will also be run for gait speed end points.

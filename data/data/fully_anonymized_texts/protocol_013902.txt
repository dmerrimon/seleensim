1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Title: Randomized Controlled Trial of Losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
1.2 Purpose:  To determine the impact of early losartan compared to placebo on the 
change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_541798]19 requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541799].  
1.3 Hypothesis: Losartan will significantly improve respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], as measured 
by [CONTACT_541822] (PEEP adjusted) P/F ratio, in patients requiring hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
1.4 Study design: Multi -center, prospective, randomized blinded interventional trial of 
losartan (50 mg orally twice daily)  versus placebo administered for 10 days or until 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
1.5 Study procedures:  
● The trial emphasizes early intervention to prevent the progression of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765]. Patients presenting to the emergency department (or 
transferred) who test positive for Covid- [ADDRESS_706899] result, whichever is later. Patients transferred 
from another facility will be eligible.  
● Investigators and research coordinators will leverage already functional 
electronic consent procedures to enroll patients safely while also 
minimizing risk to study staff . The telemedicine and eConsent platforms to 
be leveraged in this trial are actively used in NIH supported StrokeNet clinical trials, and are HIPAA compliant.  
● Enrolled patients will be randomized to losartan or placebo, and undergo 
daily assessment by [CONTACT_125900] -in safety and efficacy 
assessments . Enrolled participants will be administered study drug twice 
daily while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Study personnel will evaluate patients every day during the intervention window to review symptoms for possible adverse 
events and administer validated patient -reported dyspnea assessment at 
predetermined time points. If in- person examinations are necessary, 
study investigators trained for appropriate PPE use will perform the examinations.  
● Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs and blood samples will be 
collected from the same nostril and transported to a BSL- 3 laboratory 
(https://www.researchservices.umn.edu/services -name/biosafety -level-3-
program ). These will be stored  for public health and viral research 
purposes .  
● Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_706900] review will determine the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints, and provide additional safety data.

2.0 Background  
1.2 Significance of Research Question/Purpose :  
Since appearing in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_11520] 2 (SARS -CoV-2) has caused disease (COVID -19) in over 
800,000 people with over 40,000 deaths to date across 180 countries.1-3 The mortality is 
estimated at 3 .7%,4 with infectivity (R0) estimated at 2.[ADDRESS_706902] severely affected patients are 
admitted for respi[INVESTIGATOR_125863].7,8 At present there is no 
current specific treatment for patients with COVID -19.9 The novel coronavirus is closely 
related to the severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (SARS -CoV) which caused 
an outbreak of disease (SARS) in 2003; this may inform the development of novel treatments.
9,10 Attempts to develop vaccines since SARS or middle eastern respi[INVESTIGATOR_125864] (MERS) have been unsuccessful, will take time, and may or may not be effective for this or future coronavirus pandemics.
[ADDRESS_706903] 
been appropriately focused on screening, identification, and containment with collaboration and coordination within and between governments to combat its spread.

 [ADDRESS_706904] several promising novel 
pharmacotherapeutic strategies that differentiate this virus from seasonal or pandemic 
influenza. Similar to the 
2002- 2003 SARS -CoV, the 
SARS- CoV-2 virus binds the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_541802]-
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical component 
of the renin- angio tensin-
aldosterone (RAAS) system, in order to enter the cell.
13 
(Figure 1 – red arrow on 
right) Multiple proposed 
interventions to combat 
SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_706905] with the goal of 
blocking viral entry into cells, 
and include anti- viral 
agents,
14 anti-malarial 
medications,15 vaccines,16  
and viral protein inhibitors.9 
While these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_125866], immediate use of these interventions are not feasible. In many cases, drugs are still under development and lack a clinical indication, with limited safety and efficacy 
data in humans to date. These factors will necessarily lead to delays in drug 
development. Given the rapid spread of SARS -CoV-2, patients would greatly benefit 
from interventions with a well -established safety profile readily available for immediate 
clinical trial testing and rapid knowledge translation if efficacious.  
1.3 Rationale and Scientific Hypothesis:  
Renin -aldosterone blockade has been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID -
19.17-19 This hypothesis was originally published by [CONTACT_16836]19 on February 16, 2020 
(manuscript published in Chinese) and in the British Medical Journal  on February 4, 
2020.[ADDRESS_706906] investigating this hypothesis.  
As opposed to ongoing clinical trials targeting viral binding and entry, the proposed clinical trial proposes to mitigate the respi[INVESTIGATOR_125867] -CoV-2, ther eby 
[CONTACT_125906]. As illustrated in Figure 1, SARS -CoV-2 binds to 
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), similar to 2002 -2003 SARS -CoV. Molecular 
simulation has shown SARS- CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2 compared with SARS-
CoV.
20  
Healthy State:  
In states of health, ACE2 converts Angiotensin 2 (ATII) into lung- protective angiotensin 
(AT) 1 -7 and 1- 9, thus preventing unopposed ATII activation of AT1R. Unopposed AT1R 
activation triggers a downstream pro- inflammatory cascade, characterized by [CONTACT_541825], acute lung injury (ALI), acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), 
and death (Figure 2).4,18 AT1R activation also leads to type II pneumocyte apoptosis, a 

MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590)

VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 11 common feature of ARDS.12,13 Therefore, under usual conditions of health, ACE2 
prevents lung injury.  
Infection with SARS -CoV-2: 
Impaired ACE2 
activity due to 
binding with 
SARS- CoV-2 
results in 
excessive ATII 
allowing 
unopposed 
binding of AT1R 
without 
generation of lung-protective 
AT1-7 and AT1 -
9 (Figure 2) .
21,22 
An ongoing 
clinical trial is attempting to 
exploit this 
mechanism by [CONTACT_125908] 24 patients with recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) infusions.
[ADDRESS_706907] previously been shown to result in decreased AT2 and increased AT1- 7.
24 Unfortunately, protein recombinant human infusions are costly and 
scaling production will take significant time.  
2.1 Given this, we propose to leverage a readily available angiotensin receptor 
blocker (ARB) with an excellent safety profile, losartan, to mitigate this pathway with the 
aim of decreasing ALI/ARDS. While ACE inhibitors (ACEi) could also be considered for 
trial, ACEi are frequently associated with cough which could exacerbate the spread of the disease. In 2 8 week studies, studies, losartan had 17% and 27% rates of coug h vs 
69% and 62% (see package insert). Furthermore, ACE inhibitors can induce expression of ACE2 secondary to low local angiotensin II levels, potentially increasing viral uptake.  
Preclinical Supporting Data:   
 SARS- CoV specific preclinical work:  
In 2003, ACE2 was identified as the binding protein for SARS -CoV (Li et al, Nature, 2003).25 
This was validated in 2005 by [CONTACT_125909]. This same study identified that SARS -CoV injury 
worsens acute lung injury and can be attenuated by [CONTACT_125910]- Angiotensin (RAS) pathway  inhibition 
(Kuba et al, Nature Med, 2005).[ADDRESS_706908] identified that ACE2 knockout mice had significantly 
lower viral loads in the lung following infection, whereas wildtype (wt) mice had very high viral loads.
22 Additionally, wt mice had significantly  higher lung injury scores following SARS- CoV 
infection.22 SARS- CoV infection results in downregulation of its binding protein ACE2 (ACE2 
has been shown to be lung protective in its action of converting AT2 - > AT1 -7) (Kuba et al, 
Nature Med, 2005).22 This finding that SARS- CoV results in downregulation of ACE2 has been 
validated in subsequent studies (Glowacka et al, Journal of Virology, 2010).26 Kuba et al, then 
showed that treatment with Losartan 15 mg/kg attenuated lung injury ( Figure 3B)  and the 
development of pulmonary edema (Figure 3C)  in mice infected with SARS- CoV Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -FC.22 For 
this study 2.5- 3 month old mice received SARS -CoV Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -FC. 30 minutes later they received 

MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 12 HCL to expedite lung injury. Mice were then randomized to Losartan vs vehicle. 1 and 2 hours 
later SARS -CoV Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -FC. Mice then received 3 hours of mechanical ventilation and were 
sacrificed. (Figures 3B and C)  (Kuba et al, Nature Med, 2005).22  
 
In 2005, Imai et al showed that loss of ACE2 leads to significantly worse oxygenation, massive 
lung edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration in mice compared to wildtype mice in response to 
acid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].21 They then performed a rescue experiment and showed that supplementation 
with rhACE2 rescued infected mice (Figure 4A, B: green circles vs purple triangle and dark 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_125868]) .21  
Imai et al. demonstrated 
inhibition of AT1R via losartan 
reduced lung 
injury (Figure 5, 
light purple 
triangle) 
compared with 
vehicle (Figure 5, 
purple square) . 
This pathway was 
specific to 
inhibition of AT1R 
as, inhibition of AT2R did not 
reduce lung injury   
 Imai et al. then 
showed that 
inhibition of AT1R via losartan reduced lung injury (Figure 5, light purple triangle) compared 
with vehicle (Figure 5, purple square) . This pathway was specific to inhibition of AT1R as, 
inhibition of AT2R did not reduce lung injury (Figure 5, pi[INVESTIGATOR_125869])  For this study ACE2

 13 knockout (KO) mice were given AT1R (losartan) or AT2R 30 minutes prior to acid- induced acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS).[ADDRESS_706909] with 
ACE2:  
 Both influenza H7N9 and H5N1 have been implicated 
to cause lung injury through ACE2 with resultant 
upregulation of angiotensin- 2 and AT1R induced lung 
injury (Zou et al., Nature Communications, 2014 and Yang et al, Sci Rep, 2014).
27,28 Yiwu et al found that 
Losartan at clinically equivalent doses to humans was 
associated with increased survival, decreased lung 
edema and lung injury scores, and decreased IL -6 for 
mice infected with influenza H5N1 (Figure 6 A -E) 
(Yiwu et al, Sci China Life Sci, 2015).29  
 
 
 
Yang et al infected 4 week 
old mice with either 
influenza H7N9 or placebo.
28 Mice were given 
Losartan 30 minutes prior to viral infection. They 
identified that inhibition of 
AT1R attenuates H7N9 lung injury and was 
associated with lower wet -
dry ratios and lower infiltrative cell counts (Yang 
et al, Sci Rep, 2014).
28  
 
 
 
 
 2.2 Existing Literature:   
 There is no existing literature regarding the effect of losartan in COVID -19. To that 
effect there is limited literature regarding the effectiveness of any treatments on 
COVID -19. Data of relevance to are summarized in 2.1- 2.3.  
 There is an urgency to identify effective and readily available treatments for patients 
with COVID -19. This study will elucidate the role of losartan, this is based on strong 
physiol ogic and preclinical data as described in detail above.

 14 There is a critical and dire need to identify and evaluate all possible methods to 
minimize the burden of COVID -19 on our society and healthcare system.  At the 
current rate of growth (as of 3/13/2020) America is 1 week from widespread outbreak 
similar to Italy and Iran. Unfortunately, current community efforts are now slowing down 
spread as our slope (see Figure below) is higher in the last few days than the rest of the 
world.  
 
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcomes:  The primary endpoint is to determine the 
impact of losartan on respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. This will be determined by [CONTACT_541826] (PEEP adjusted) P/F ratio at 7 days , a validated routinely 
used in critical care research derived from the partial pressure of oxygen or 
peripheral saturation of oxygen by [CONTACT_541827][INVESTIGATOR_218686] (PaO2 or SaO2 : FiO2 ratio).30,31 PaO2 is preferentially used if available. A 
correction is applied for endotracheal intubation and/or  positive end- expi[INVESTIGATOR_22325]. Patients discharged prior to day [ADDRESS_706910] a home pulse oximeter sent 
home for measurement of the day 7 value, and will be adjusted for home O2 us e, if 
applicable. Patients who died will be applied a penalty with a P/F ratio of 0.  
3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s):  
3.3 There will be 7 secondary endpoints:  
● To ensure losartan is safe and well tolerated in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19, we will:  
o Compare daily hypotensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (MAP < 65 mmHg) prompting intervention (indicated by a fluid bolus >=500 mL)  
o Hypotensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_541803] (vasopressors or fluid 
bolus)  
o Determine the incidence of new or worsening renal failure

 15 ● Daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to day 10. If data 
are unavailable for any given organ failure, we will use the last value carried forward approach.  
● Change in estimated P/F ratio daily between groups  
● In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 28, and 90- day mortality (by [CONTACT_541828])  
● Resource utilization as assessed by: [CONTACT_541829], ventilator free days, oxygen free days, vasopressor free days, ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]  
● Respi[INVESTIGATOR_541804] (BiPAP), high flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilation or 
extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) utilization, as well as 
trends in S/F ratio.  
● Symptomatic improvement as assessed by [CONTACT_541830] -
12 assessments of dyspnea and functional status  
● Percentage of subjects reporting each severity rating on the 7- point ordinal 
scale  [ Time Frame: Day 15 ]   
▪ The 7-point ordinal scale  is an assessment of the clinical status at the first 
assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on non- invasive 
ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring 
supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental 
oxygen; 6) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities; 7) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no 
limitations on activities.  
▪ Change in viral loa d (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab  and blood) 
1.4 Justification of the primary outcome:  This trial seeks to mitigate lung injury from 
Covid -[ADDRESS_706911] patients present to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125872], and the primary mechanism of death is via respi[INVESTIGATOR_125873] -system organ failure.
7 Prevention of progression 
of acute lung injury with an angiotensin receptor blocker such as losartan may decrease 
estimated P/F ratio , a validated measure of lung dysfunction that accounts for 
differences in the level of ventilatory s upport. We considered respi[INVESTIGATOR_541805], 
but this crude ordinal measurement is estimated off of the estimated P/F ratio, which will 
provide a more precise measurement of the same physiology. Estimated P/F is a 
clinically relevant outcome not only to patients, but also to the healthcare system 
due to overwhelming surge of patients straining hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541806] -19 at risk, but also those admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541807] .  
 
● Rationale for the timing of the primary endpoint:  The average time from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541808] 2- 3 days, and average 
length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541809] 10 days .32 We considered a 3 day outcome time 
point to minimize the need for home measurement and early death. 
However, >[ADDRESS_706912] a treatment benefit. We also considered 10 days, but this increases competing risks and decreases the sensitivity and strength of using the continuous primary outcome but increasing the 
proportion of patients who either die or recover, skewing the data.  We 
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 16 believe 7 days to represent the optimal balance of these competing 
concerns.  
3.4 Justification of the secondary outcomes:  Patients severely infected with 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_541810], acute kidney injury, or the development of hypotension, so we will systematically track these measured 
instead of relying upon adverse event reporting which introduces the potential for bias. 
We will measure P/F ratios daily in case our choice of [ADDRESS_706913] a difference in this outcome. Resource utilization and respi[INVESTIGATOR_541811]. Validated study instruments to assess dyspnea and physic al function 
will assess patient -centered outcomes and strengthen the biologic plausibility of the 
intervention. The 7- point ordinal scale described is used by [CONTACT_541831]- 19 
clinical trials and will allow harmonization of the trial results. Changes  in viral load are 
important to assess the theoretical possibility of losartan induced ACE2 expression leading to increased viral entry, propagation, and shedding.  
 
4.0 Study Interventions / Interventional Agents  
4.1 Intervention arm:  The intervention is losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker  
prepared in suspension per the package insert, administered at 50 mg PO twice daily for 
10 days (patients with eGFR 30 -59 mL/min/1.73 m2 will be given 50 mg once daily) or 
until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever comes first. The supply of suspension is stable for 4 weeks refrigerated according to the package insert. Any unused doses will be discarded if unused by [CONTACT_941] 28 day time point.   
● Rationale for the duration of the intervention:  The average duration of 
mechanical ventilation caused by [CONTACT_205888]- [ADDRESS_706914] already demonstrated significant clinical 
improvement, and would introduce significant logistical limitations.  
● Rationale for the dose of treatment:  The lowest dose of losartan is [ADDRESS_706915] 20 mg per day.33 Twice daily 
dosing has been shown to potentiate angiotensin- II receptor blockade 
compared with once daily dosing. At this dose, extrapolated data 
suggests <70% inhibition of angiotensin- II receptors. At the highest 
maximum allowable dose (50 mg twice daily) we would anticipate >80% 
inhibition of angiotensin- II receptor.  We believe this is necessary as these 
patients have significant pro inflammatory response. Recent reports 
indicate that patients with COVID19 have increased plasma Ang II levels 
and that Ang II levels correlate with COVID19 disease severity and viral 
load. AT1R inhibition is associated with decreased activity of STAT1 and 
NFkB downstream signaling as confirmed by [CONTACT_124450]. 
Furthermore, since our initial submission Losartan has been identified for 
its potential inhibitory effects on SARS -CoV2 viral life cycle based on 
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 17 molecular docking analysis of the coronavirus macrodomain. We propose 
a dose increase to 100 mg daily  (50 mg PO BID in patients without renal 
dysfunction) . We have previously utilized this dose in previous RCTs in 
HIV (Schacker/Fletcher). These studies confirmed the safety profile of 
Losartan with a mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction of only 7 
mmHg at 100 mg daily and excellent tolerability and safe ty profile. Our 
findings confirm prior reports of 6 mmHg mean SBP reduction for 
Losartan when doses at 100mg daily. Patients will receive intensive 
safety monitoring as this will be delivered in the inpatient setting with 
blood pressure checks multiple tim es per day and minimum required 
potassium, creatinine and GFR checks prior to enrollment, day 1, 3, and 7 
(or prior to discharge) . In addition, patients will have routine creatinine 
and potassium monitored if ordered clinically  We hypothesize significant 
benefit as [ADDRESS_706916] significant reductions in disease severity and inflammatory 
profile for patients treated with ACEi or ARBS with no preliminary reports 
suggesting harm from ACEi or ARBS in Covid19 patients.  
● We propose a dose of [ADDRESS_706917] blockade. Patients with moderate renal dysfunction (eGFR 30 -59 
mL/min/1.73 m
2 will be given 50 mg once daily given impaired renal 
clearance.  
4.2 Placebo arm : The same volume of suspension prepared according to the 
package insert will be administered without the active ing redient.  Any unused doses of 
placebo will be discarded if unused by [CONTACT_941] 28 day time po int.   
4.3 Investigational new drug. The study will be conducted under IND 148365 . 
4.4 Timing of the intervention: Treatment will continue for 10 days or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  
4.5 Duration of study participation:  The final follow -up will occur at 90 days after 
randomization to determine epi[INVESTIGATOR_125881]. Data analysis is 
expected to be completed within 1 year of enrollment of the final patient.  
4.6 Drug Handling, blinding, and randomization:   
Fairvi ew Investigational Drug Services (IDS), part of M Health Fairview will oversee the 
preparation of treatment drug and placebo. Identical suspensions  (#20) will be prepared  
in identical syringes and labeled with a deidentified study number coded by [CONTACT_125914]. A site -specific randomization schema will be created (each site will 
undergo block randomization in variable permuted blocks by [CONTACT_541832]). Given significant differences in outcome by [CONTACT_654], patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_125916]  
(>=60 , <60). Randomization allocation will be 1:1. IDS will not be blinded to patient 
randomization. All other members of the study, the participants, and the clinical care team will be blinded to treatment allocation. 
4.7 Provision  of study drug to patients: The local Fairview or HCMC pharmacy will 
dispense the patient specific supply to each patient after consent has been obtained and

VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 18 a prescription has been received from an authorized prescriber. The investigational drug 
or placebo will be provided to the bedside nurse twice daily for the duration of study 
participation.  
4.8 Study unblinding: MHealth Fairview, East bank Inpatient Pharmacy UMMC 
campus, will hold the blind for all subjects on study. In the event of an emergency and 
unblinding is necessary, study staff can contact 612- 273-3066, option 1, then option 2. 
This information is included on each label.

5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Screening: Screening logs containing non -identifiable information (age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, location of presentation, and reason for exclusion) will be maintained for patients screened but not enrol led. Initial pre -screening to 
determine study eligibility will necessarily proceed under waiver of informed 
consent and waiver of HIPAA authorization through the screening of electronic 
medical records. In addition, sites will have an electronic dashboard of all pending 
and confirmed positive COVID -19 tests that can be used for real -time prescreening 
of patients. If the patient appears to be eligible based on pre- screening, and if 
acceptable to the treating physician, the patient will be approached by a study 
investigator or delegated study coordinator or research nurse. For the sake of 
healthcare provider safety, and to minimize the spread of the virus, this visit will 
occur via a HIPAA compliant telemedicine consultation o r phone.   
 
5.2 Enrollment: Patients or their legally authorized representative, with due 
consideration of vulnerable patient populations, (see section 9) will be eligible for consent by [CONTACT_541833]. At this visit, consents will 
be reviewed in detail with the subject or LAR. The subject or LAR will have the 
opportunity to ask questions. If the patient (or LAR) agrees to become a study participant, electronic consent will be obtained using HIPAA and rule 11 compliant 
electronic consent, stored and maintained in a secure RedCap server (see 
departmental policy on eConsent).  For patients who are enrolled via a LAR, we will 
attempt to reconsent the patient for ongoing study participation. If they decline, previous information gathered will be utilized but no further information will be 
collected. If the patient is unable to be contact[CONTACT_541834], or they do not regain capacity to consent, the participant will continue to participate in study procedures under LAR consent.  
 
● Rationale for the use of telemedicine / phone consent : We have chosen 
this method of consent in order to minimize risk to research team and 
healthcare providers, and to decrease community spread of the disease . 
We have prior experience using telemedicine and phone consent coupled 
with electronic consent form review for time -sensitive clinical trials of 
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 19 stroke. While the rationale for eConsent is different in this case 
(minimization of disease spread during a pandemic), we believe it is 
appropriate  for the disease and intervention being studied. Critically, the 
established safety profile of losartan, with minimal side effects of effects 
on blood pressure in healthy patients without an overactive renin-
angiotension -aldosertone system, combined with the close telemedicine 
and EMR based follow -up methods proposed in this study make the risk : 
benefit ratio for the alteration of traditional consent process acceptable for 
participants, providers, and the public.  
5.3 Administration of study drug: Study drug will be dispensed to bedside nurses twice daily for administration. Patients unable to take the suspension (due to 
endotracheal intubation) will have it administered via  an orogastric or nasogastric 
tube, or G -tube. If the patient is unable to receive the study drug for respi[INVESTIGATOR_4783], we will allow for +/ - 3 hours from the scheduled time of drug 
administr ation. If this is not possible, the patient will not receive that dose, and this 
will be tracked. 
5.4 Patient follow -up: Participants will receive remote telemedicine, phone, or in 
person evaluation by [CONTACT_541835] [ADDRESS_706918] patients complete 2 surveys at enrollment, day 4, day 
10, and day 28 (both attached in supplement), if the patient can cooperate. If not, 
the reason for failure to complete the survey will be recorded. Surveys conducted 
within 1 day of the time point will be counted as qualifying and not missing. 
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_541836] 28 (+/3 days) and 90 (+/- 3 days)  for intermediate 
term outcomes . If follow -up procedures are not completed due to inability (patient 
unavailable or intubated), or due to loss to follow -up, these will not be counted as 
protocol deviations.  
5.5 Pharmacokinetics: Patients undergoing this voluntary substudy will have up to 
another 9 mL of total blood drawn (30 mL total day 1 instead of 21 -24 mL day 1. 
The remainder of the samples will be the same for the duration of the study). Blood will be processed, frozen at - [ADDRESS_706919]. Courtney Fletcher at the 
University of Nebraska for analysis.

6.0 Data and Specimen Banking  
6.1 Data management:  
● Storage and Access:  Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical 
research staff under the supervision of Drs. Tignanelli and Puskarich. 
Study data will be recorded within a RedCAP database with study 
personnel being granted access to the database based on the tasks listed 
in the Delegation of Authority log. Only deidentified data with no PHI will 
be exported for analysis. The electronic consent (eConsent) forms, which will be  maintained in a University of Minnesota RedCap database with 
established functionality for this purpose in our group. The database is HIPAA compliant.  
● Monitoring:  A designated study monitor  will review 100% of electronic 
consent documents, study drug administration data, and SAE reporting. Additionally, a random sampling of 5% of subjects will undergo full 
evaluation and comparison of source documentation with data entered 
into the study database. The first data monitoring visit will be scheduled 
once 10% of the cohort has been enrolled, with repeat monitoring after 
50% and 100% of enrollments. Monitors will evaluate 100% of users to ensure assigned access is consistent with training and delegation of 
authority logs.  Remote clinical monitoring with source verification of the 
electronic health record will be allowed given limitations in local site access in the setting of the COVID epi[INVESTIGATOR_541813] -based monitoring principles.  
● Release/Sharing:  Data will be shared among members of the study team 
with appropriate access assigned in Redcap based on study role, training, and delegation of authority. Data will be made available to assigned study 
monitors, the data safety monitoring board, the appropriate University of 
Minn esota oversight authorities, the Food and Drug Administration, and 
other state and federal regulatory authorities as required by [CONTACT_541837].  
● Data sharing: Requests for data following study completion for sharing 
will be evaluated by a steering committee that will be established and will 
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 22 include the principal investigators. Requests will be evaluated on a case-
by-case basis. If data are shared, only deidentified data will be shared.  
6.2 Biospecimen management:  
● Specimen banking:  Biologic specimens ( nasopharyngeal or 
oropharyngeal swabs and blood samples) provided by [CONTACT_541838]. Specimens will be transported and processed by [CONTACT_541839] -3 
laboratory and frozen at -80 C until the time of analysis. Samples will be 
deidentified and labeled only with a patient ID number.  Other sites will be 
encouraged to also obtain these specimens using local resources, with transfer of collected materials as they are able.   
● Biospecimens and protocol deviations: Baseline clinical laboratory results 
will be required to establish inclusion and exclusion criteria, and missing data will be reported as protocol deviations. However, significant barriers 
exist to the collection and processing of other biospecimens due to the 
increased containment required, meaning that not every study site may be able to accomplish these procedures. In addition, patient self -
collection will lead to missing samples. While every effort will be made to 
obtain these biospecimens, failure to do so will not constitute protocol 
deviations.  
● Specimen sharing:   Requests for specimen sharing during or following 
study completion for sharing will be evaluated by a steering committee 
that will be established and will include the principal investigators. 
Requests will be evaluated on a case- by-case basis. If specimens are 
shared, human genetic analysis will only proceed on those patients who opt-in to genetic testing. Genetic testing of viral genomes will be allowed 
to proceed on all patients.  
 
7.0 Sharing of Results with Participants  
7.1 Sharing of results: Data collected within this study will be obtained from the participants themselves and recorded on collection templates or directly into 
Redcap, or will be obtained from the electronic medical record and thus are 
already available to the patient and treatment team. Any testing of biospecimens will occur at a later time point and do have specific clinical relevance and will not 
be shared with the patient.  
7.2 Sharing of genetic testing 
● Disclosure of results:  There is no plan to disclose genetic results to the 
patients as none is yet planned.   
● If returning results to participants: N/A  
7.3 Future analysis of genotypes:  Genetic testing, while potentially an area of future 
investigation as a means to determine if participants with specific genetic differences are more or less susceptible to COVID -19, is not currently planned nor funded. As such, 
data will not be disclosed  to the participants. To the extent possible in future work, 
participants or families with rare variants will undergo attempts at anonymization.

 23 8.0 Study Population  
8.1 Inclusion Criteria  
● Presumptive positive laboratory test for Covid- [ADDRESS_706921]   
● Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age 
● Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_541814] >=1 and increased 
oxygen requirement compared to baseline among  those on home O2   
● Randomization within [ADDRESS_706922] result, whichever is later  
8.2 Rationale for inclusion criteria: This is a pragmatic trial looking to enroll a diverse 
cohort of participants so the results may be broadly applicable to a wide patient  
population if efficacious. We do not have sufficient data to support lack of efficacy in a 
specific subgroup at this time to justify their exclusion. However, a respi[INVESTIGATOR_541815] [ADDRESS_706923] plans to 
evaluate the possibility of expanding to include that patient population as soon as 
logistically feasible.   
8.3 Exclusion Criteria  
● Randomization > [ADDRESS_706924] result, 
whichever is later  
● Currently taking an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)  
● Prior reaction or intolerance to an ARB or ACE inhibitor, including but not limited to angioe dema  
● Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
● Lack of negative urine or serum pregnancy test  
● Not currently taking a protocol allowed version of contraception: 
intrauterine device, Depo -formulation of hormonal contraception (e.g. 
medroxyprogesterone acetate / Depo-P rovera), subcutaneous 
contraceptive (e.g. Nexplanon), daily oral contraceptives with verbalized 
commitment to taking daily throughout the study period; use of condoms or agree to abstain from sexual intercourse during the study. All women of 
child bearing age enrolled in this fashion will be informed of the 
teratogenic risks. If enrolled under LAR, they will be informed of the risks 
after regaining capacity.   
● Patient reported history or electronic medical record history of kidney 
disease, defined as:  
o Any history of dialysis  
o History of chronic kidney disease stage IV  
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 24 o Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of < 30ml/min/1.73 
m2 at the time of randomization  
● Severe dehydration at the time of enrollment  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_541816] 
● Most recent mean arterial blood pressure prior to enrollment <65 mmHg  
● Patient reported history or electronic medical record history of severe liver disease, defined as:  
o Cirrhosis  
o History of hepatitis B or C  
o Documented  AST or ALT > 3 times the upper limit of normal 
measured within 24 hours prior to randomization 
● Potassium >5.0 within 24 hours prior to randomization unless a repeat 
value was <=5.0  
● Treatment with aliskiren   
● Inability to obtain informed consent from participant or legally authorized 
representative 
● Enrollment in another blinded randomized clinical trial for COVID  
8.4 Rationale for exclusion criteria: We expect treatment results to be available within 
24 hours of testing given the acuity of the patient, though delays are expected so this 
window is open until 48 hours for logistical considerations. We wish to limit interventions 
to an early window, as progression from admission to mechanical ventilatory support 
occurs within days, and we intend to maximize potential efficac y of the treatment to 
mitigate respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Patients already taking or with prior adverse events to either an ACE inhibitor or ARB are excluded for risk of side effects. Losartan is a class D drug. Women of child bearing age (14 -60) without a history of hysterectomy must have a 
documented negative pregnancy test in the emergency department or have had a prior 
history of hysterectomy. We will exclude patients with significantly elevated creatinine or 
liver enzymes expected to affect drug clearance. A liskiren is contraindicated for losartan 
co-treatment. Patients with hypotension will be excluded given an expected decrease of 
6-8 mmHg in their blood pressure that might necessitate the need for cardiovascular 
interventions. Finally, all patients or their legally authorized representative will give

increase vulnerability to coercion or exploitation 
that might influence consent to research or 
decision to continue in research.  Excluded from Participation  
 
9.2 Additional safeguards: 
● Non-English speakers : Excluding this group would compromise the principle of 
justice in clinical research. For groups likely to be enrolled given our known 
demographics (Spanish- speaking and Somali -speaking), we will translate 
informed consent forms (ICF) and use professional interpreters during both the consent and follow -up periods. These interpreters are available to our group 
during daytime hours by [CONTACT_756]. We will request the use of the Short Form 
Consent for non- English speaking particiapnts, and adhere to the regulatio ns 
surrounding its use.  When the translated ICsF become available, they will be 
used for non -English speakers.
 
● Employees or students of the researcher: To minimize the potential for coercion, 
any employee or student of the research will undergo screening and informed consent by [CONTACT_3462], but not by [CONTACT_125931]. The screening will not be performed by 
[CONTACT_125932], so this group may opt out in a deidentified 
fashion at that stage. Furthermore, if the potential participant wants to enroll, all 
interactions will occur with a different study investigator (such as the other co-
principal investigator. These two clinical investigators work in different 
departments with di fferent staff).   
● Undervalued or disenfranchised social group:  We will assure confidentiality, that 
they have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty, and they have the freedom to refuse to answer questions.  
 
● Active members of the military (service members), DoD personnel (including civilian employees):  The status of participants of this group is not asked during 
the study nor known by [CONTACT_464], and therefore vulnerability is not increased for 
anyone in this  group.  
 
● Individual or group that is disadvantaged in the distribution of social goods and services such as income, housing, or healthcare: We will assure participants that 
participation in this study will be treated with the strictest confidentiality, that they 
have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty, and they have the freedom 
to refuse to answer questions.
 
● Individual or group with a serious health condition for which there are no satisfactory standard treatments:  We will assure that information from 
participants in this study will be treated with the strictest confidentiality, that participants have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty, and they have 
the freedom to refuse to answer questions.
 
● Individual or group with a fear of negative consequences for not participating in 
the research (e.g. institutionalization, deportation, disclosure of stigmatizing 
behavior):  The status of participants from these groups is not asked during the 
study nor known by [CONTACT_464], and that vulnerability is not increased for anyone in this group.

 27 10.1 Locations: Enrollment will occur on the ED (or designated COVID19 areas) of 
participating study sites see section 22.1).  
 
10.2 Number of participants: We expect to enroll a minimum of 200 participants, with 
up to 220 participants when considering screen failures and withdrawals.  
 
11.0 Local Recruitment Methods  
11.1 Recruitment Process: See section 5.0  
11.2 Identification of Potential Participants: See section 5.0  
11.3 Recr uitment materials:  N/A 
1.5 Payment:  Patients will be eligible for a $[ADDRESS_706926] for their time to return for the 
15-day blood draw for renal function testing  if allowed by [CONTACT_176106].  
 
12.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
12.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  Participants may be withdrawn from research without 
their consent if they develop SAEs that the investigator believes to be likely related to 
the study drug. Participants may also withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason. All patients withdrawn from the study will be analyzed using intent to treat 
principles.  
12.2 Withdrawal Procedures:  If patients choose to withdraw, study procedures 
including intervention and follow -ups will stop. Given the risks of transmission of 
infectious disease, written notification is not required. If the patient chooses to withdraw, 
the study team will ask if the patient is willing to allow continued electronic medical 
record evaluation for the determination of study endpoints (partial withdrawal). We will also ask if the patient wishes to  withdraw consent for the use of future biologic 
specimens. If the patient declines to participate in any component of research, no further study data will be collected, biologic samples will be destroyed, but existing study data 
may be used. Each of these will be documented and stored as a study document. 
12.3 Termination Procedures:  Upon trial termination, study outcomes will be followed 
until completion. Case report forms and collection templates will be maintained in paper format (when application) and electronically for 7 years in accordance with regulations. 
Collected data will be used for secondary analyses with approval of the principal 
investigators in a deidentified fashion. Data entry will be completed, checked for 
accuracy, and locked for analysis wit hin 1 year of enrollment of the final patient.  
13.0 Risks to Participants  
13.1 Foreseeable Risks:  Potential risks of losartan are detailed in consent forms. The 
most severe risks of losartan use include teratogenicity in the setting of pregnancy, 
hypersensitivity including angioedema, symptomatic hypotension, worsening of 
renal function, and electrolyte abnormalities.  The most common side effects of 
losartan include fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, chest pain and anemia.  Subjects will 
be rigorously screened to ensure t hat they are at low risk for complications due to 
losartan and they will be monitored closely for side effects and signs of toxicity. 
The package insert for Losartan has been included with this protocol. Clinical trial 
and post -marketing surveillance data (see package insert) demonstrate an 
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 28 excellent safety profile. In over 4,000 patients, there was a low incidence of 
adverse events (2.3%) comparable to placebo (3.7%). The effects more common in losartan than placebo were clinically minor, including dizziness (3% vs 2%), 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (8% vs 7%), nasal congestion (2% vs 1%) and back 
pain (2% vs 1%). While losartan has the potential to cause symptomatic 
hypotension, four studies have identified losartan has a negligible effect on resting 
blood pressure and heart rate in healthy volunteers.
33-[ADDRESS_706927] is lacking. 
We will monitor troponin and BNP/pro -BNP levels in participants and report these 
data to the DSMB if measured clinically . In fact, the most recent preprinted (non -
peer reviewed) data from China now suggest a protective effect based on 
retrospective data compared to other antihypertensive regiments. Nevertheless, 
based on this recent suggestion, we will track troponin and BNP/proBNP 
measurements in addition to our previously planned assessments of new epi[INVESTIGATOR_541817], and report these data to the DSMB. In addition, all 
patients are closely monitored for clinical purposes given their severity of i llness, 
combined with daily assessments for AEs and SAEs will allow for early detection of 
side effects and reduce the risks to patients.  
13.2 Reproduction Risks:  Losartan is class D in pregnancy. Women of childbearing age 
will only be eligible for enrollment with a negative pregnancy test prior to 
enrollment. In addition, women breastfeeding will be excluded from the study.  
13.3 Risks to Others:  The primary risk to others is the risk to study personnel of 
becoming infected with COVID -19. To overcome this barrier, patients will be 
enrolled using an electronic consent process already established among our group 
for other studies. In addition, follow -up evaluations will preferentially be performed 
by [CONTACT_541841]. If a face -to-face evaluation or 
physical examination is required due to concern for adverse events, investigators trained and fitted with N95 masks or equivalent will perform a face- to-face 
examination. Participants will generate potential biohazards (oropharyngeal swabs), the safety steps surrounding which are discussed in section 6.2. 
14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
14.1 Potential Benefits:  If randomized to the intervention arm, and if losartan is 
demonstrated to prevent the progression of acute lung injury, patients may benefit 
by [CONTACT_125933], decreased need for oxygen or mechanical ventilation, or possibly lower mortality. If randomized to the control arm, there is no 
direct potential benefit to the patient. However, the proposed research has the potential  to significantly benefit people infected with COVID- 19. 
15.0 Statistical Considerations  
15.1 Data Analysis Plan:  All analysis will focus on comparisons between the treatment 
and control groups. Demographics and other baseline clinical characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_18672], standard deviation, median, and interquartile range 
(IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical 
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 29 variables. The primary outcome, change in estimated P/F ratio at 7 days , will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_541842] 95% asymptotic confidence 
intervals. Patients discharged home will be given a pulse oximeter and called for 
the value at 7 days, adjusted for home  O2 use as applicable. Patients who died will 
be penalized with a P/F of 0 (lower values indicate higher degree of respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518]) in order to address competing risks. Like respi[INVESTIGATOR_541814], an adjustment 
is applied based on the use of PEEP. For the primary statistical analysis, 
Treatment groups will be compared using the two- sample t -test for unequal 
variances and the treatment effect will be summarized by [CONTACT_541843].  As a secondary statistical approach, we will also jointly model the 
longitudinal and time to event outcome under the assumption of informative 
missingness, jointly modeling P/F ratio measured daily and time to death using a 
shared random effects model.  Finally, we will analyze these data on an ordinal 
scale (the respi[INVESTIGATOR_541805]), which is a 0- 4 ordinal scale derived from the 
estimated P/F ratio. In addition, patients who die prior to the day [ADDRESS_706928], as appropriate. Appropriate data transformations will be 
used to assure that assumptions of all statistical tests are met. Time- to-event 
endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier curves and compared using Cox 
proportional hazards regression. For all endpoints, we will complete secondary analyses comparing for important baseline variables that are unequally distributed 
between treatment groups.  Preplanned subgroup analyses are planned by [CONTACT_654] 
(dichotomized at 50 and by [CONTACT_125938]), history of hypertension, sex, and smoking 
history, timing of randomization from symptom onset, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_541818].  
15.2 Power Analysis : Assuming a fixed sample size, we analyzed power using a 
number of assumptions. In general, studies with a similar degree of acute lung injury that we expect in this study have a standard deviation of estimated P/F ratio 
of [ADDRESS_706929] 
>0.[ADDRESS_706930] a difference in P/F of 50. Differences of less than this are of 
uncertain clinical significance. This method and outcome has more power than our alternative approach of respi[INVESTIGATOR_541814], which is a more crude measure of the 
estimated P/F ratio.

16.11  Storage and Disposal of Paper Documents:  At this time we do not anticipate any 
paper documents related to this study. Everything, including consents will be done 
electronically. If the need for paper collection templates becomes evident, these 
documents will be stored in locked rooms where only study personnel have access. They will be maintained for 7 years as legally required, after which time 
they will either be destroyed or moved to long -term storage.  
17.0 Confidentiality  
17.1 Data Security:  All data will be stored on servers (Redcap and CTSI AHC -IE data

individual research computers, flash drives, etc. These servers Redcap and the 
data shelter meet all data regulatory requirements and are HIPAA  compliant.  
18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
18.1 Integrity Monitoring: Data entry will be performed by [CONTACT_125942]. Data integrity will be overseen by [CONTACT_541846] . A study monitor will 
review 100% of electronic consent documents, study drug administration data, and SAE reporting. Additionally, a random sampling of 5% of subjects will undergo full 
evaluation and comparison of source  documentation with data entered into the 
study database. The first data monitoring visit will be scheduled once 10% of the 
cohort has been enrolled, with repeat monitoring after 50% and 100% of 
enrollments. Monitors will evaluate 100% of users to ensure assigned access is 
consistent with training and delegation of authority logs. The project research 
coordinators at the sites will maintain binders containing pertinent documents and 
information including IRB approval letters, documentation of GCP training, 
licenses, human subjects research ethics training certificates, curriculum vitae, and 
correspondence.  
18.2 Adverse events reporting  
● Definition of an Adverse Event (AE): An AE is any symptom, sign, illness, or experience that develops or worsens in severity duri ng the course of 
the study but does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study agent/intervention or procedures.   A clinical trial adverse event is defined 
as any untoward medical event associated with the use of a drug or study 
procedure. The I nvestigators will determine daily if any adverse events 
occur during the period from enrollment (signing of the informed consent) through study day 15. Investigators will determine if the event is serious 
or related to the study drug. The rationale for thi s time window is the half -
life of 2 hours for losartan and 6 -9 hours for its metabolite.   Even in the 
setting of impaired clearance, 3 days after study drug cessation is more than adequate to help to define the period at risk from losartan. Abnormal 
result s of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the 
abnormality:  
o results in study withdrawal,  
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 34 o is associated with a serious adverse event (SAE),  
o leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests, or 
o is considered by [CONTACT_125943].  
● Definition of a Serious Adverse Event : Adverse events are classified as 
serious or non -serious.   An SAE is any AE that is:  
o Fatal,  
o life-threatening,  
o requires or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408],  
o results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
o a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or  
o an important medical event.  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately 
life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They 
may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent [ADDRESS_706934] 15 study days, regardless of the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_125890]. Thereafter, serious adverse events are not required to 
be reported unless the investigator feels the events were related 
to either study drug or a protocol procedure.  
Study site personnel must alert a study investigator of any serious and 
study drug or study procedure related adverse event within 24 hours of 
investiga tor awareness of the event. Alerts issued via telephone are to be 
immediately followed with official notification on the adverse event case report form.  
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded 
as non- serious AEs.  
● Preexisting Condition: A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.   A preexisting condition will be recorded as an AE if the 
frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
● Post-study A dverse Event: All unresolved AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_125944], the subject is lost to follow -up, 
or the AE is otherwise explained.   At the last scheduled visit, study 
personnel will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) 
within [ADDRESS_706935]’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation 
in this study.   
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 35 ● Abnormal Laboratory Values: A clinical laboratory abnormality should be 
documented as an AE if any 1 of the following conditions is met: 
o  The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity that 
worsened from the time of enrollment, or  
o The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; 
e.g., change of dose, disc ontinuation of the drug, more frequent 
follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
● Continuous SAEs of interest monitoring: The following SAEs will be 
continuously reported to the DSMB: deaths . Cardiovascular events (need 
for vasoactive drugs or fluids for hypotension), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] 
(worsening hypoxia, worsening acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or 
new respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399])  will be continuously reported to the DSMB within 
24 hours of recognition for  safety reasons. While they will be reported 
continuously, they will not necessarily be filed as SAEs unless the investigator deems it to be related to study procudures (see below)  
● Other  outcomes that may be exempt from adverse event reporting: Study 
spec ific outcomes as outlined in 5.1 and 5.2 are exempt from adverse 
event reporting unless the investigator deems the event to be related to the study procedures (or of uncertain relationship) or if the event leads to discontinuation of study procedures. The following are examples of 
events that will be considered study specific clinical outcomes and will be 
systematically tracked through the study design. The rationale for this 
criteria is that these events are likely to be present in a large proportion of 
the study population, and relatedness will be subject to significant 
subjective assessment, making adverse event reporting can be sporadic 
and inconsistent . Therefore,  events more likely to be truly related to a 
study intervention are better treated by [CONTACT_541847]:  
o Respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]: decreased PaO2/FiO2, hypoxia, worsening 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  
o Cardiovascular events: (need for vasoactive drugs or fluids for hypotension)  
o Hepatic events: hepatic injury or liver dysfunction that leads to an increase from baseline in the serum level of bilirubin.  
o Renal events: renal failure, renal insufficiency, or renal injury that 
leads to an increase from baseline in serum creatinine.  
o Hematologic/coagulation events: coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytosis.  
o Changes in serum sodium and potassium  
● Scales Used to Grade Severity of Adverse Events: All AEs will be graded 
in the following manner:  
o Grade 1 (Mild): Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
o Grade 2 (Moderate): Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern.   Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning.  
MEDICA L PROTOCOL (HRP -590) 
SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 36 o Grade 3 (Severe): Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily 
activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment.   Severe events are usually incapacitating. 
o Grade 4 (Life- threatening): Any adverse drug experience that 
places the participant, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does not 
include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
o Grade 5 (Death)  
● Scales Used Attribute Adverse Events : The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_125891]: 
o Definitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study 
agent/intervention administration and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153]. The response to 
withdrawal of the study agent/intervention (de -challenge) should 
be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory re -
challenge procedure if necessary.  
o Probably Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, oc curs 
within a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
agent/intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically 
reasonable response on withdrawal (de- challenge). Re -challeng e 
information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
o Possibly Related: There is some evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time 
after administration of the trial medication). However, the influence 
of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the 
subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an 
adverse drug event may rate only as “possible” soon after 
discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and 
later be upgraded to probable or certain as appropriate. 
o Unlikely:  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, whose temporal relationship to study agent/intervention 
administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the 
event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the 
subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). 
o Not related: The AE is completely independent of study 
agent/intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].

SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 37 ● Response to possibly, probably , or definitely related AEs and SAEs: 
SAEs determined to be probably or definitely related will prompt 
discontinuation of  study drug.  AEs determined to be probably or definitely 
related with prompt a) decrease in study drug from twice a day to once a day if currently dosing twice daily, b) discontinuation of study drug if only 
taking once daily, or c) discontinuation for study drug at the discretion of 
the investigator.  
● Anticipated Adverse Events : Adverse events are not expected from any of 
the study procedures.   We do not expect any serious adverse events due 
to losartan.  
● Recording and Documentation  
o At each contact [CONTACT_1155], personnel must seek information 
as to discomforts or adverse experiences by [CONTACT_71997], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. This will typi[INVESTIGATOR_541819]. Information about AEs to be recorded includes event description, time of onset, investigator assessment of severity, 
relationship to Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s), and time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event.   All AEs occurring during th e 
study period (from time of consent signing to study day 15) must 
be documented appropriately regardless of relationship to study 
products or procedures unless included on the list of clinical 
outcomes that may be exempt from adverse outcomes reporting 
as part of the study protocol and outcomes.  Information on all 
identified AEs will be recorded within 5 days  of recognition in the 
appropriate AE module of the case report form (CRF) on Redcap , 
and within 24 hours in the event of a SAE .  
18.3 Data Safety Monitor ing: A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has been 
convened and includes 4  individuals meeting the key element criteria below, and 
includes a biostatistician with prior clinical trials DSMB experience.  The DSMB will 
follow the guidance as outlined in the application and the attached charter unless there is a compelling, unanticipated reason to deviate from these rules. Data 
regarding the primary outcome (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be reported to the DSMB continuously, consistent with continuous study monitoring principles. The DSMB 
may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_125893], following these guidelines:  
[Patient Safety] A recommendation to suspend, alter the study,  or stop for harm 
would occur if d uring continuous monitoring there is  strong evidence that the rate 
of IRB -reported SAEs was significantly higher in the experimental group than in 
the placebo group. SAEs (including increasingly level of ventilator support and 
initiation of vasopressors, the two SAEs of interest) will be reported within 24 hours, allowing for continuous study monitoring. For the inpatient cohort, we propose formal interim analyses for safety at 10%, 20%, and 30% of enrollment. A 
50% preplanned interim analysis for safety, efficacy, and futility is planned with specific stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_541820] a guide. Assuming a baseline 
mortality rate of 10%, this corresponds to formal hypothesis testing after every ~2 
events initially, and decreasing as data accumulate. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_541821], the DSMB will still receive near real -time reporting of 
deaths , and can deviate from this strategy and perform earlier testing if desired.

SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 [ADDRESS_706936] additional safety 
assessments after the 50% assessment, if they feel that additional formal testing 
is needed.  
[Efficacy] – A preplanned interim analysis at 50% of enrollments will assess for 
early efficacy or futility.  
 The DSMB will operate in accordance with guidelines established by [CONTACT_34033] 
“Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committee” jointly published by [CONTACT_541848], CDER and CDRH of the FDA 
(https://www.fda.gov/regulatory -information/search- fda-guidance-
documents/establishment -and-operation- clinical- trial-data- monitoring -committees) . The 
key elements include:  
1. Expertise and independence: The members must have expertise in the area of 
study, not be study authors and have no financial conflict of interest. 
2. Members will sign a confidentiality agreement.  
3. It is preferred that the DSMB have a face- to-face initial meeting, but can meet 
by [CONTACT_541849]. 
4. All meetings must follow standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
If the DSMB recommends closure of the study, then the DSMB Chair will email the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_32397]. If the trial is stopped for patient safety and a repairable 
cause of unacceptably high adverse events can be identified, the action must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_125947]. For 
example, if one additional exclusion criterion is discovered that would account for the majority of unexpected events, this new exclusion criterion could be added, and the 
study could proceed.  
19.[ADDRESS_706937] the Privacy Interests of Participants  
19.1 Protecting Privacy:  Conversations will be held in a private room whenever 
possible. Telephone calls will be performed one on one.  The electronic consent 
process takes place using a secure RedCAP server that is HIPAA compliant . 
19.2 Access to Participants:  Conduct of the study and determination of both safety and 
efficacy of the intervention requires access of the medical records. All study 
personnel undergo human subjects protection training and understand and value 
privacy standards set forth by [CONTACT_2373]. Participants enrolled in the tr ial are made 
aware during the informed consent procedure that study personnel will be required 
to access this private information for trial conduct, and consent to this access prior 
to agreeing to participate.  
20.0 Compensation for Research- Related Injury  
20.1 Compensation for Research- Related Injury:  There is no compensation available for 
research related injury from the study team. Due to the coronavirus public health 
crisis, the federal government has issued an order that may limit your ability to recover damages if you are injured or harmed while participating in this COVID -19 
clinical study. If the order applies, it limits your ability to recover damages from the University, researchers, healthcare providers, study sponsor, manufacturer or

20.[ADDRESS_706938] Language:  N/A. 
21.0 Consent Process  
21.1 Consent Process (when consent will be obtained):  All subjects participating in this 
study or their LARs will be required to provide prospective informed consent using 
an eConsent platofrm.  Prior to doing so, will discuss the study with study 
personnel who have been specially trained in obtaining informed consent. Our 
team has significant experience in this process, with due consideration of vulnerable patient populations. The  subject or LAR will review the eConsent in 
detail and have the chance to ask questions.  The personnel will then ask the subject questions to ensure that they understand the information presented in the 
consent discussion using a teach back method.  The rights and welfare of the 
participants will be protected by [CONTACT_541850]. A copy of the informed consent document will be available electronically to 
the participants for their records.  The participants may withdraw consent at any 
time throughout the course of the trial (see withdrawal procedures). The eConsent 
forms are included in this IRB submission.  
21.2 Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (when consent will not be obtained): N/A 
21.3 Waiver of Written/Signed Documentation of Consent (when written/signed consent will not be obtained):  N/A  
21.4 Non-English Speaking Participants:  Spanish and Somali speaking persons, who 
represent the vast majority of non- English speaking patients in the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25817], will be included as described above.  
21.5 Participants Who Are Not Yet Adults (infants, children, teenagers under 18 years of age):  Patients will be excluded per the study protocol. If logistical and scientific 
concerns can be adequately addressed, we will submit a revised application with an ethical framework, scientific support, and logistical considerations. 
21.6 Cognitively Impaired Adults, or adults with fluctuating or diminished capacity to consents:  To establish capacity in this setting, the MacArther Competence 
Assessment tool will be administered by [CONTACT_7355]. If the patient 
lacks capacity, a LAR may provide consent for these participants on their behalf. 
For adults unable to consent, consent will be obtained from a legally authorized 
representative in the following order of priority consistent with Minnesota State 
Law: health care agent previously assigned via a health care power of attorney, spouse, parents, adult children, and then adult siblings. An incapacitated adult who 
has a court appointed guardian would require permission of the court for 
enrollment, and these participants will be excluded practically from the trial.   
21.7 Adults Unable to Consent: The same process  will be applied as in 21.6.  
21.8 Assent and dissent in adults with fluctuating or limited mental capacity:

SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID -19 
VERSION DATE: 22APR2020 
 
 40 ● Assent : If patients might have capacity, we use the MacArthur 
Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research. If they do not reach 
the pre- specified threshold for capacity, we seek from an LAR. We do not 
seek further assent, as these patients are frequently intubated, delirious, or medically sedated 
● Dissent : However, even if the LAR consents to the trial, if the patient is 
awake and alert, but dissent, we will exclude the patient.  
22.0 Setting  
22.1 Research Sites:  
● Participating study sites will undergo a standardized screening process to 
ensure they can participate in necessary aspects of the study protocol, 
and comply with safety and remote oversight, legal, and regulatory 
procedures. All sites will cede to the central (Advarra) IRB in addition to 
undergoing local context review, as appropriate.

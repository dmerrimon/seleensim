Confidential 5 Objectives:  
Primary : 
To evaluate the efficacy of ZYN002  administered  as a transdermal gel formulation , for up to 12 weeks,  
in patients ages 3 to < 18 years, in the treatment of symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS).  The 
primary endpoint is the change from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_1001791] -
Community FXS Specific (ABC -CFXS) Social Avoidance subscale.   
 
Secondary : 
To further evaluate the efficacy of ZYN002 in the treatment of symptoms of FXS. 
To evaluate the safety of ZYN002 in  the treatment of symptoms of FXS. 
To evaluate CBD, CBD metabolite and tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) exposure . 
 
Methodology :  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, multiple- center study, to assess the efficacy 
and safety of CBD administered as ZYN002, a transdermal gel, for the treatment of child and 
adolescent patients with FXS.  Male and female patients with FXS will be treated for 12 weeks with a 
  single -blind placebo lead-in preceding the 12-week double-blind treatment period.  
Approximately 204  male and female patients, ages 3 to <  18 years, will be randomized 1:1 to either 
trial drug  or placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_547], weight category  and region.  
Site-specific supplemental protocols may be implemented in a subset of ZYN2 -CL-016 patients. 
Study Screening:  
Prior to any Screening Procedures being performed, the parent/caregiver will provide written informed 
consent and, i f applicable, the patient will provide assent.  During the Screening Period, the site staff 
will review the eligibility criteria, review any medications including over -the-counter (OTC) 
medications the patient is taking, obtain the patient’s medical histor y including their Fragile X 
Diagnosis, any seizure history and demographics, check their vital signs, perform an electrocardiogram 
(ECG), assess Tanner Stage, perform a physical and neurological exam and a skin assessment, obtain 
blood and urine for analys is, and administer assigned scales.  Blood samples will be taken for 
hematology and chemistry testing, testosterone (T) testing (males only), pregnancy testing (if 
applicable) and Cytosine Guanine Guanine (CGG) repeat analysis.  Patients will also have a b lood 
sample drawn for plasma levels of CBD and THC testing, and adjunctive anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs) 
(for patients using AEDs).  Urine will be collected for a urinalysis and drug screen.  The scales 
administered include the ABC -CFXS, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule®-2 (ADOS®-2) ( 
ADOS®-2 will not be administered at Screening if it has been administered in the prior 6 months and 
the results are available ), Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI -S), Columbia- Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale – Children’s version (C -SSRS), Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist – Short Form (MWC, 
Behavior Checklist), Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC -20) and the Vineland Adaptive 
Behavior Scales™ 3rd Edition (VABS-3).   

Protocol ZYN2- CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential 6 The parent/caregiver will also be asked the  following question “What are the five behavioral, 
emotional, or social problems that most impacted your son/daughter and his/her family in 
approximately the past year?”  This is referred to as the “Qualitative Caregiver reported Behavioral 
Problems Survey ” in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 3 .  Optionally, if an intelligence quotient 
(IQ) test was performed previously those results may be provided to the Sponsor.  
 
  Single Blind Placebo Lead- In Period:  
Following the Screening period, eligible patients will start a  Placebo Lead -In period.  At 
Visit 2, parents/caregivers will be instructed on proper application of the study gel (active/placebo gel).  
  
Parents/caregivers will apply all trial drug to clean, dry, intact skin, thoroughly massaging it into the 
right and/or left upper arms and shoulders until  the area is dry.  The study gel will be rubbed in 
completely and must be dry prior to dressing.  
  
 
Parents/caregivers will use gloves supplied by [CONTACT_733175].  If redness occurs at 
the application site, the parent (after consultation  with the Investigator) may switch the application site 
temporarily to the  upper  thighs.  Parents/caregivers will complete the Caregiver Global Impression of 
Severity scale at Visit 2.  
 
12-Week Double Blind Treatment Period  
At Visit 3, patients will be ran domized to receive either ZYN002 or placebo.  Patients will qualify for 
randomization if they continue to meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for the 
study.  Patients eligible for randomization will be either:  
• Patients with an AB C-C FXS  score  on Study Day [ADDRESS_1001792]  
OR  
• Patients with an ABC -CFXS  score of  with an  ABC -CFXS  
score  on Study Day [ADDRESS_1001793] be reviewed for eligib ility for randomization.  
In a blinded fashion, ZYN002 -treated patients who weigh < 35 kg will receive 125 mg CBD Q12H 
(every 12 hours)  (± 2 hours); for a total daily dose of 250 mg CBD.  Patients who weigh > 35 kg will 
receive 250 mg CBD Q12H ( +2 hours); for a total daily dose of 500 mg CBD.  All patients will remain 
on their assigned dose  during the 12 weeks of the treatment phase of the study.  Study visits will occur 
at Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5) and Week 12 (Visit 6).  Patients who have success fully 
completed the [ADDRESS_1001794] 90% compliant with the trial 
drug and visits  will have the option to enroll in an Open-Label Extension Study (OLE).  A w eekly 
Telephone Follow -Up call will occur for four weeks f ollowing the last dose of trial drug for patients 
who do not enter the OLE.  

Protocol ZYN2- CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential 7 Patients and parents/caregivers will be required to visit the clinic at Week -2 (Visit 2), Study Day 
1/Week 1 (Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12 (Visit 6) for vital signs, ECG, 
concomitant medication check, physical and neurological exams, Tanner Stage assessment, skin check 
examination, adverse event (AE) review including seizure assessment if applicable, and completion of 
the following questionnaires and s cales: ABC -CFXS, Anxiety Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS),

End of Study  (EOS) / Early Termination Visit (ET) : 
Patients who have successfully completed through Week [ADDRESS_1001795] 90% 
compliant with the trial drug and study visits  will have the opportunity to continue in an OLE Study.   
Patients not on AEDs who are not continuing in the OLE study or are prematurely discontinuing will 
complete the EOS procedures at Visit 6/ET.  See Table 3  Schedule of Assessment s for procedures at 
Visit 6/ET.  
Patients taking concomitant AEDs who are not continuing in the OLE study or are prematurely 
discontinuing will taper down their study dose in the following manner at Visit 6/ET:  
• For patients weighing < 35 kg (250 mg daily dose), the dose of trial drug will be reduced, in a 
blinded manner, to a total daily dose of 125 mg ZYN002 or 2.98 g placebo gel each day for one 
week ( one sachet each morning), after which time the patients will discontinue from the study and 
attend the EOS V isit.  See Table 3  Schedule of Assessments for procedures at the EOS Visit.  The 
parent/caregiver will be contact[CONTACT_733176] -20. 
• For those patients >  35 kg (500 mg daily dose), the dose of trial drug will be reduced, in a blinded 
manner over two weeks : during the first week of taper the dose will be reduced to 125mg Q12H; 
(ZYN002 or placebo) (+ 2 hours); total daily dose of 250 mg, followed by a second week of taper 
from 250 mg total daily dose to a total daily dose of 125 mg ZYN002 or 2.98g placebo gel each 
day ( one sachet each morning).  After the taper, patients will discontinue from the study and 
attend the EOS V isit.  See Table 3  Schedule of Assessments for procedures at the EOS Visit.   The 
parent/caregiver will be contact[CONTACT_733177] P eriod and complete the MWC  and 
PWC -20. 
  
 
Patients who do not enter the OLE study or who discontinue early will have a Telephone Follow- Up 
call weekly for four weeks following each patient’s last dose of trial drug.  The parent/caregiver will 
be contact[CONTACT_733178] -Up and complete the MWC  and PWC-20.   
 
 
 
 
 

Protocol ZYN2- CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential 8 Safety Monitoring:  
Patient safety will be monitored during study visits using standard measures, including physical and 
neurological exams, Tanner S tage assessment, examination of skin at application site s for irritation , 
vital signs (including oral, infrared forehead or tympanic temperature), 12 -lead ECGs, the C -SSRS, the 
MWC,  the PWC -20, safety laboratory tests, urinalysis, seizure assessment and AE monitoring.   
Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion Drug Event Rep orting System ( MADDERS) will be used to 
systemically capture and adjudicate abuse -related events.   At the discretion of the investigator, patients 
will be allowed a short act ing sedative (such as midazolam) to assist with the collection of blood 
samples a nd ECG’s. 
At Screening, patients will have an epi[INVESTIGATOR_733147].  The parents/caregivers of patients with a current epi[INVESTIGATOR_110330]/or seizure diagnosis will be 
asked at each study visit if there has been any increase in frequency or severity of the patient’s 
seizures.   If an increase in frequency or severity is noted, this will be recorded as an adverse event 
(AE) in the case report form (CRF).  
Parents/ caregivers will be provided a diary to complete a daily skin check examination.  Every evening 
they will record the skin check score in the daily skin check diary.  When skin redness is noted, 
parents/caregivers should apply the gel to a non -red area of the upper arms and shoulders.  If the skin 
check sc ore is higher than ‘2’(moderate erythema) at any time, the parent/caregiver will contact [CONTACT_733179].  The Investigator will use discretion in 
suspending dosing for patients with a skin check score of ‘4’ but will, in all cases, immediately (within 
24 hours) complete an adverse event report and contact [CONTACT_733180] (CRA) 
and the Zynerba Medical Monitor.    A de -identified photograph of the skin finding (or area) of interest 
may be  taken after consultation with and approval of the Sponsor.  Digital photographs will be  retained 
for information purposes only.  In place of suspending the dosing due to skin irritation , the Investigator 
may instruct the parent/caregiver to temporarily change the application site to the upper thigh.  
 
Blood Samples of AEDs, CBD, and THC : 
Blood samples for plasma levels of CBD and THC will be collected at the Screening Visit , Visit 4 , and 
Visit 6 /ET.  Plasma may also be analyzed for CBD metabolite concentrations.   In addition, blood 
samples for adjunctive AED blood levels (for patients taking AEDs) will be collected at Screening , 
Visit 4 , and Visit 6 /ET.  The time of blood sample collection, as well as the time of last AED and trial 
drug dose, will be recorded.  Plasma samples will be analyzed
 
  Plasma samples for adjunctive AEDs will be analyzed through a 
commercial laboratory.   
 
Number of Patients (planned): Approximately 204 male and female patients will be randomized 1:1 
to either trial drug or placebo.

Confidential 13 Safety Analyses:  
Safety assessments will include collection of AEs including seizure assessment if applicable, physical 
and neurological examination, Tanner Stage assessment, 12 -lead ECG, clinical laboratory assessments 
(hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, C -SSRS, MWC, PWC -20, and findings from the 
skin check examinations following treatment.  All patients who receive at least one dose of 
randomized  trial drug will be included in the safety analysis.    
Plasma Concentrations of CBD, THC and AEDs:  
Plasma concentrations for CBD, THC and concurrent AEDs will be summarized by [CONTACT_321169] (active or placebo) and by [CONTACT_733182] t ime points.  Plasma may also be 
analyzed for CBD metabolite concentrations.   
  
 
Statistical Methods:  
The sample size was estimated for the primary efficacy endpoint using Power Analysis and Sample 
Size Software (PASS 15) (NCSS, 2017).  Sample size requirements were based on a previous Phase 1/2 
trial, ZYN2 -CL-009, in patients with FXS and on published results in the literature with other studied 
treatments in this indication.  A sample size of 102 patients per treatment group (204 patients total) is 
required for the detection of a 1.3 -point diffe rence (assuming a standard deviation of 2.8) in the ABC-
CFXS Social Avoidance subscale score between treatments (active versus placebo) using a [ADDRESS_1001801] 
at the 5% significance level with 90% power.  
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviati on, minimum, and maximum) for continuous data 
and number (n) and percentage (%) for categorical data will be presented for all efficacy and safety 
parameters.  
All efficacy assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_21964].  
Unless otherwise sta ted, mixed effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) will contain fixed 
effects for treatment, visit, study site, region and treatment- by-visit interaction as factors as well as the 
continuous fixed covariate of baseline value for the dependent variable of interest.   
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models will contain fixed effects for treatment and study site  and

For MMRM/ANCOVA, descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_765], which will include least -
squares mean, least -squares standard errors, and p -values for between treatment group test s.  
 
The statistical comparison of active versus placebo for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 
ABC -CFXS Social Avoidance scores will be based on MMRM.   The same model used for the primary 
endpoint analysis will also be used for the key secon dary endpoints of change from B aseline in ABC -
CFXS Irritability, and Socially Unresponsive/Lethargic subscale scores.  The statistical comparison of 
active versus placebo for the key secondary endpoint of CGI -I will be based on Wilcoxon rank sum 
test.   
Response rate for the secondary endpoint defined as the number of patients who have ≥ 25% 
improvement from baseline in ABC -CFXS Social Avoidance subscale score will be compared using a 
chi-square test and binomial confidence intervals.   Response rate for the secondary endpoint defined 
as the number of patients who have ≥ 25% improvement from baseline in ABC -CFXS Irritability  
subscale score will be compared using a chi -square test and binomial confidence intervals.  The

The response rates for the percent of patients improved using CGI -I, and for patients having both ≥ 
25% improvement from Baseline in ABC - CFXS Social Avoidance  subscale scores  AND improved on 
CGI-I scale will be compared using the chi -square test and binomial confidence intervals.   The 
response rates for the percent of patients improved using CGI -I, and for patients having both ≥ 25% 
improvement from Baseline in ABC - CFXS Irritability subscale scores AND improved on CGI -I scale 
will be compared using the chi -square test and binomial  confidence intervals.   
The statistical comparison for active versus placebo for the Family Impact module of the Pediatric 
Quality of Life (PedsQLTM) will be based on ANCOVA.  The statistical comparison of active versus 
placebo for the CGI -S will be based  on Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test, adjusting for the baseline score

cannabinoid contained in the Cannabis  sativa L . plant.  The CBD contained within ZYN002 is a 
pharmaceutically produced Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) that is chemically identical 
to the CBD present in Cannabis .   
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a rare genetic condition caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene 
(Haldeman -Englert 2013) located on the X chromosome.  Mutations in the FMR1 gene, which 
silence the expression of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), are characteristically found in patie nts with FXS.  FMRP, a  ribonucleic acid  (RNA ) binding protein, is important for 
normal synaptic function, synaptic plasticity, and the development of neuronal connections over time during brain  maturation.   The absence of FMRP in neurons accounts for many of the 
neuropsychiatric symptoms of Fragile X.   Both males and females are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_733149].  However, since the responsible gene is on the X chromosome, and only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene is enough to c ause the symptoms, FXS 
is inherited in an X -linked dominant pattern.  In females (who have two X chromosomes), a 
mutation in one of the two genes can be sufficient to cause the disorder.  In males (who have 
only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene can cause the disorder.   While 
females are more likely to suffer from FXS, and are at increased risk of having a child with FXS, 
males typi[INVESTIGATOR_733150] X inactivation (Crawford et al. 
2001). 
FXS is characterized by [CONTACT_733185], including anxiety (particularly social 
anxiety /avoidance ), deficits in learning and cognition, sleep difficulties, seizures , social 
unresponsiveness and stereotypy  (Lozano et al. 2015).  These symptoms are typi[INVESTIGATOR_733151], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_120530], psychostimulants for hyperactivity and 
deficits in attention, and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], valproic acid, and lamotrigine for seizures (Fragile X 
Clinical Research Consortium 2012).  Unfortunately, many of these medications are ineffective 
for a number of patients with FXS  and lead to multiple deleterious consequences (e.g., agitation, 
diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, memory, and sleep problems), some of which 
coincide with symptoms already experienced by [CONTACT_733186] (Fragile X Clinical Research 
Consortium 2012; Lozano et al. 2015).  CBD is believed to have the potential for attenuating the 
loss of endogenous endocannabinoid signaling in FXS, allowing the FMRP protein deficiency inherent in FXS to be by[CONTACT_92842].  Abnormalities seen in FXS appear to be rooted in dysregulation 
of the endocannabinoid pathways in the central nervous system.  T he endocannabinoid system 
consists of receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues that are involved in numerous 
physiological processes, as well as the endogenous cannabis -like ligands (endocannabinoids): 
anandamide (AEA) and 2- arachidonoyl glycerol (2 -AG).  The endocannabinoids bind to G -
protein- coupled receptors, Cannabinoid receptor type 1 ( CB
1) and Cannabinoid receptor type 2 
(CB 2) (Mouslech and Valla 2009;  Pacher et al. 2006) and modulate synaptic transmission 
throughout the central nervous system (Castillo et al. 2012;  Ohno- Shosaku and Kano 2014).  CB 1 
receptors are abundantly expressed in the brain, and they are present at lower concentrations in a variety of peripheral tissues and cells.  CB
2 receptors are expressed primarily in the immune and 
hematopoietic systems, as well as in the brain, pancreas, and bone (Pacher et al. 2006). 
Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  26 In patients with FXS, there is a reduction of endogenous stimulation of endocannabinoid 
receptors (see Figure 1 ).  CBD has the capacity to interact with an FXS -compromised 
endocannabinoid system.  Disruption of FMRP in FXS reduces the production of 2- AG, 
decreasing activation of CB 1 receptors in the central nervous system (Jung et al. 2012).  CBD has 
been hypothesized to increase 2 -AG availability (Elmes et al. 2015 ; Di Marzo and Maccarrone 
2008), potentially attenuating or reversing one of the biological mechanisms of abnormal cellular 
function in FXS (Jung et al. 2012).  Importantly, studies have shown that CB 1 protein expression 
is unaffected in FMR1 Knock Out (KO ) mice, suggesting that the downstream elements of 
endocannabinoid signaling can be engaged even in the absence of FMRP (Zhang and Alger 
2010). 
Figure 1 :  Mechanism of Impaired Endocannabinoid Signaling in Fragile X  
 
Legend: Disruption of FMRP (red X) in FXS reduces the production of 2- AG (clear circles), decreasing activation 
of CB1 receptors in the central nervous system.  Loss of FMRP leads to a reduction of 2- AG production because the 
lack of FMRP expression disrupts diacylglyc erol lipase (DGL) activity.  (Jung et al . 2012)  
In addition to the role of 2- AG, recent work has begun to highlight the potential importance of 
AEA in impacting social impairment as well as deficits in learning and memory among those 
with FXS.  In an FMR1 K O mouse model of FXS, Qin and colleagues (2015) demonstrated that 
increased levels of AEA were associated with greater cognitive performance.  Similarly, Wei et al. (2016) utilized a mouse model of FXS to show that increasing AEA activity resulted in impro vements in social impairment.   Much like its impact on 2 -AG, CBD has been shown to 
increase levels of AEA (by [CONTACT_733187]; FABP).  FABPs are 
intracellular proteins that transport AEA to the catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydro lase 
(FAAH), an enzyme that breaks down AEA (Figure 4 in Bisogno et al. 2001; Table 3 in Pertwee 

Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  27 2008; Leweke et al. 2012 ; Elmes et al. 2015).  Binding to FABP is thought to result in increased 
AEA availability and greater CB [ADDRESS_1001820] synaptic plasticity.   Mice lacking FMRP show alterations in synaptic plasticity, as 
evidenced by a reduction in long -term depression (LTD) of neuronal response properti es in in 
vitro slice preparations (Zhang and Alger 2010).  Preclinical data suggest that restoration of LTD 
in FMR1 KO mice requires activation of endocannabinoid receptors (Figure 4A in Zhang and 
Alger 2010).  Therefore, it is hypothesized that CBD will increase synaptic plasticity in FXS, 
facilitating one of the basic cellular mechanisms thought to be associated with learning and improvements in cognition (Zhang and Alger 2010) .  Finally, more recent work has begun to 
identify deficits in GABA receptor ex pression among those with FXS.  As FMRP has been 
shown in animal models to enhance expression of GABA receptors, the lack of FMRP among those with FXS has been associated with fewer GABA receptors (Lozano et al. 2015).  Indeed, 
non-clinical studies in FMR1  KO mice have consistently shown down- regulation of the GABA 
system (Hare et al. 2014).  As CBD acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA -A receptors 
(Bakas et al. 2017), CBD may act to enhance the binding affinity for GABA. 
The existing literature c ombines to demonstrate that CBD may positively impact individuals with 
FXS through many mechanisms, including the endocannabinoid and GABA systems.  While a 
number of drugs have been developed to target specific systems (e.g., GABA agonists), CBD 
may serve  as a treatment that is likely to yield a multi- faceted benefit to individuals with FXS.  
CBD has not only been shown to be generally well tolerated relative to other treatments used in 
this population (Rohleder et al. 2016), but numerous studies have documented its benefits in 
terms of sleep quality (Carlini and Cunha . 1981; Chagas et al. 2014), anxiety (Bergamaschi et al. 
2011; Viveros et al. 2005), cognitive impairment (Bergamaschi et al. 2011), and seizures 
(Friedman and Devinsky 2015).  Anxiety symptoms are commonly associated with FXS.  Both 
non-clinical (e.g., Blessing et al. 2015) and human (e.g., Bergamaschi et al. 2011) data have 
demonstrate d the efficacy of CBD in  the alleviation of anxiety symptoms.  Reviews have 
highlighted anxiolytic effects of  CBD in over 30 animal studies, using models for multiple types 
of anxiety (i.e., generalized anxiety models, stress -induced anxiety models, panic disorder 
models, and contextual fear conditioning models), as well as in a growing number of human studies, particularly in social anxiety.   Several studies have explored potential mechanisms of 
action and demonstrated that the anxiolytic effects of CBD are likely due in large part to its effects on 5 -HT
1A (serotonin) . 
5.2. Non-clinical Summary  
To support the clinical  development of ZYN002, Zynerba has relied  upon:  
• Data from non -clinical safety studies conducted by [CONTACT_733188]002, ZYN002 
placebo gel, or CBD, the active ingredient in ZYN002,  
• Publicly available information about the toxicity/safety of CBD and the e xcipi[INVESTIGATOR_733152]002, and  
• Clinical safety data generated by [CONTACT_733189]002.  
Published non- clinical studies with CBD indicate that it does not produce adverse effects on 
nervous system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or gastrointestinal function, although it does  exhibit beneficial 
activity in some nervous system disorders (e.g., anticonvulsant and anxiolytic activity) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., anti -inflammatory activity).  In a  good laboratory practice  (GLP )-

at an estimated plasma concentration (4350 ng/mL) that is  greater than the expected 
plasma  maximum observed concentration (C max) in patients over a 14-day period .  
Based on this information, human subjects using ZYN002 are unlikely to experience adverse effects on nervous system, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or gastrointestinal function. 
ZYN002 was devoid of systemic toxicity in animals given topi[INVESTIGATOR_733153] 10% of their 
body surface area daily for up to 26 weeks (rats) or twice a day for up to 13 weeks (minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]).

Repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_733154]002 have revealed no effects on 
endocrine systems or reproductive organs in either species.  Published information suggests that 
CBD has the potential to affect reproductive function in animals, at least in males, possibly 
secondary to effects on sex hormone levels (Dalterio et al. 1984; Da lterio and deRooij, 1986).  
Published information also suggests that administration of CBD to pregnant mice has the potential to affect development of offspring, at least to males  (Dalterio et al . 1984; Dalterio and 
deRooij 1986). 
CBD does not absorb UV or visible light over 290-700 nm (Hazekamp et al. 2005) and so 
ZYN002 does not present a potential phototoxicity hazard to human subjects.

these studies are as follows:  
• 
 
 
 
•
 THC was not quantifiable in either plasma or urine. 
• There is adequate animal NOAEL:  human exposure ratios for AUC and C max.  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate: 
•  
 
•  
Because CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the major isoforms responsible for CBD metabolism, 
concomitant administration of drugs that inhibit these enzymes may result in higher exposure to 
CBD and drugs that induce these enzymes may result in lower exposure to CBD; therefore, strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may increas e or decrease the plasma concentrations of 
CBD and should be administered with caution. 
As a potential perpetrator, CBD would not cause a clinically significant induction of CYP 
isoenzymes.  However, CBD exhibited time-dependent inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, 
which was reversible, and of CYP3A4, which was irreversible.  Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index or risk for severe toxicity should be avoided until this risk has been assessed with ZYN002.  CBD did not inhibit human efflux and uptake transporters.  
5.3. Clinical Summary  
CBD studies completed with oral, inhaled, and intravenous (i.v.) formulations support a 
favorable tolerability and efficacy profile in several disease states , including topline data for 
ZYN002 in FXS .  These effic acy and tolerability data provide a rationale for development of the 
transdermal delivery of synthetic CBD which is not subject to gastric acid degradation and first pass metabolism in the liver, and may achieve consistent blood levels for the treatment of child  
and adolescent patients with FXS . 
5.3.1. Literature Review  
Oral CBD has been clinically studied in healthy subjects and patients with a variety of conditions.  The literature studies help to clarify the clinical potential of ZYN002 transdermal gel 
in the following areas: 
• Most assessments have used a [ADDRESS_1001823] 
been treated with oral CBD doses of 1200 mg or more (Zuardi et al. 2010; Matsuyama and 
Fu 1981), and one study employed a 1500 mg dose (Zuardi et al. 2006a).  More recent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_733155] 25 – 50 mg/kg of oral doses in patients (age 1-30 years) (Devinsky et al. 2016; Devinsky et al. 2017).  The mean CBD dose at 12 weeks was 

Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  31 22.9 mg/kg corresponding to a [ADDRESS_1001824] dose, Zynerba has studied a 780 mg daily dose at a CBD concentration of 4.2% 
(ZYN002 4.2%, 4.64 g twice a day).  
Data from a recent randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled trial of cannabidiol as add- on 
therapy in 171 patients with Lennox Gastaut syndrome, aged 2- 55 years (mean of 15 years) 
supported the efficacy seen in the open- label study (Thiele et al. 2016).  Patients rec eived an oral 
solution of cannabidiol [Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]®, GW Pharmaceuticals, London, [LOCATION_006]; 100 mg per mL sesame 
oil-based solution] titrated to a dose of 20 mg/kg/day or placebo in two divided doses.  A median 
reduction in total seizures of 45% in the CBD group ve rsus 15% in the placebo group reported.  
Drop seizures were reduced by a median of 49% in the CBD group compared to 20% in the 
placebo group.  The most common adverse events (>10% of cannabidiol -treated patients) were 
similar to those seen in the open- label study and included diarrhea, somnolence, decreased 
appetite, pyrexia, and vomiting. 
Data supportive of the open- label results in patients in Dravet syndrome has also been reported 
from a recent randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled trial of 120 children and young 
adults (mean age of 9.8 years, range 2.3 to 18.4 years)  (Devinsky et al. 2017).  Patients received 
an oral solution of cannabidiol [Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]®, GW Pharmaceuticals, London, [LOCATION_006]; 100 mg/mL 
sesame oil -based solution] titrated to a dose of 20 m g/kg/day or placebo in two divided doses.  
The primary endpoint was the change in convulsive -seizure frequency over a 14 -week treatment 
period, as compared with a four -week baseline period.  The median frequency of convulsive 
seizures per month decreased f rom 12.4 to 5.9 with cannabidiol, as compared with a decrease 
from 14.9 to 14.1 with placebo (adjusted median difference  between the cannabidiol group and 
the placebo group in change in seizure frequency, - 22.8 percentage points; 95% confidence 
interval [C I], -41.1 to - 5.4; p=0.01).  The percentage of patients who had at least a 50% reduction 
in convulsive -seizure frequency was 43% with cannabidiol and 27% with placebo ( OR: 2.00; 
95% CI; 0.93 to 4.30; p=0.08).  The frequency of total seizures of all types w as significantly 
reduced with cannabidiol (p=0.03), but there was no significant reduction in non- convulsive 
seizures.  Adverse events that occurred more frequently in the cannabidiol group than in the 
placebo group included diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, py rexia, somnolence, and abnormal results 
on liver function tests. 
Long- term exposure:  — The [ADDRESS_1001825] been used 
(Martin -Santos et al. 2012;  Bhattacharyya et al. 2012 ; Winton- Brown et al. 2011;  Fusar -Poli et 
al. 2010;  Bhattacharyya et al. 2010 ; Fusar -Poli et al. 2009, Borgwardt et al. 2008), and several 
patients have taken CBD for 4.5 months (Cunha et al. 1980).  The 25 mg/kg oral doses were studied for 3 months in an open- label expanded access trial (Devinsky et al. 2016).  
Psychoactive effects:  — Studies of the potential psychoactive effects associated with CBD have 
not been widely reported until recently.  Previous reports suggest the absence of psychoactive 
effects whether CBD is administered intravenously  (Perez -Reyes et al. 1973) or orally (Englund 
et al. 2013;  Martin -Santos et al. 2012;  Bhattacharyya et al. 2012;  Bhattacharyya et al. 2010 ; 
Zuardi et al. 2009) .  And pre -treatment with oral CBD 600 mg has been shown to inhibit the 
psychosis and cognitive impairment associated with intravenous (IV) THC 1.5 mg (Englund et al. 2013;  Bhattacharyya et al. 2010).  A recent placebo- controlled study with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_733156] (36%), diarrhea (31%), fatigue (20%), vomiting (15%), and lethargy 
(13%) (Devinsky et al. 2017) .  These effects could be due to drug, underlying disease, potential 
conversion of oral CBD to THC or a combination of these factors.  Previous work has shown that 
Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  32 in the presence of acidic reagents, CBD isomeri zes to tetrahydrocannabinol (Ga oni and 
Mecoulam 1966).  In simulated gastric fluid, CBD converts to Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol, 9- α-
hydroxy -hexahydrocannabinol and 8- hydroxy -iso-hexahydrocannabi nol.  All have psychoactive 
activity (Merrick et al. 2016; Watanabe et al. 2007). 
Effects on vital signs or clinical lab tests:  — CBD -treated subjects in clinical studies have 
shown no treatment -related effects on key vital sign indicators, including blood pressure and 
heart rate (Martin -Santos et al. 2012;  Hallak et al. 2011;  Fusar -Poli et al. 2009;  Borgwardt et al. 
2008;  Zuardi et al. 1993a ; Consroe et al. 1991;  Zuardi et al. 1982, and Perez -Reyes et al. 1973), 
as well as electrocardiography (Guy and Flin t 2003; Carlini and Cunha 1981; Cunha et al. 1980).  
Guy and Flint (2003) performed cardiac monitoring continually from pre -dose to four hours 
post-dose along with pre - and post -dose ECG.  Heart rate, PR interval, QT interval and QRS 
width were evaluated pre - and post -dose.  Elevated transaminases (ALT or AST) without 
association of drug induced liver injury have been identified in epi[INVESTIGATOR_733157] (Devinsky et al . 2016;  Devinsky et al. 2017;  Bebin et al. 2017;  
Devinsky et al. 2018).  Most cases were associated with the concomitant use of valproic acid and 
resolved with continued treatment or with dec reasing the dose of valproic acid, CBD or 
discontinuation of CBD.  
No association with response inhibition:  — Findings from functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and behavioral studies show that CBD modulates function in regions not usually 
implicated  in response inhibition.  In terms of clinical sequelae, these data help to explain why 
CBD does not impair motor or cognitive performance and has anxiolytic effects (Borgwardt et al. 2008). 
5.3.2. ZYN002 Phase 1 studies  
Three Phase 1 (ZYN2 -CL-01, ZYN2- CL-02, and ZYN2 -CL-08) studies investigating ZYN002 
(CBD) administered via a transdermal delivery system have been conducted in healthy subjects 
and patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  In addition, one placebo study  (ZYN2 -CL-06) was conducted to 
evaluate the skin tolerability of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_733158]002 formulation. 
These efficacy and tolerability data provide a rationale for development of a transdermal delivery 
of synthetic CBD which is not subject to first pass metabolism and may achieve consistent blood levels for the t reatment of  patients with FXS and epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  
A summary of the safety results from the Zynerba studies further supports the development of ZYN002.  Four Phase 1 safety and tolerability study results as follows:  
• ZYN2 -CL-01, a single rising -dose study in healt hy subjects (n=32) and patients with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (n=10) receiving ZYN002 (50, 100, 125,  and 250 mg) or placebo showed that 
ZYN002 was safe and well tolerated at all doses.   The incidence of treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) associated with ZYN002 was similar to placebo in healthy 
volunteers.  There were no serious adverse events (SAEs), no clinically significant changes in ECGs, vital signs or clinical laboratory results.  ZYN002 had good skin tolerability, and 
there was no post -dosing erythema at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. 
• ZYN2 -CL-02, a seven -day repeat application, multiple rising dose study of healthy subjects 
(n=24) receiving ZYN002 (200, 250, 500 mg/day), and patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (n=12), 
receiving 500  mg/day showed that ZYN002 was safe and well tolerated at all doses.  One 
subject receiving placebo discontinued due to an SAE, a device related infection (catheter) 
not related to trial drug .  Most TEAEs were mild in intensity and there was only one severe 
Protocol ZYN2- CL-016.[ADDRESS_1001826] frequently reported TEAE that was not associated with 
the application site.  There were no clinically significant changes in ECGs or vital signs.  
•  
 
  
 
 
  
• ZYN2 -CL-08, a 14-day repeat application study in healthy subjects (n=42) receiving 
ZYN002 (394.8, 500, and 504 mg/day) or placebo showed that ZYN002 was safe and well tolerated at all doses.  Most TEAEs were mild in intensity.  Most TEAEs were considered n ot 
related to trial drug and either resolved or were resolving at the time of database lock.  No 
SAEs were reported and no subjects discontinued from the study due to a TEAE.  Headache 
and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_733159]002 and placebo.  Application site dryness, application site pain, and application site pruritus were the next frequently reported TEAEs.   
In the completed clinical pharmacology studies, ZYN002 was not associated with any 
impairment in critical areas of cognitive functioning often impacted by  [CONTACT_242150]  
(CNS ) drugs, including divided attention and working memory and focused attention after single 
or repeat doses of ZYN002 at doses up to [ADDRESS_1001827] comple ted in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (ZYN2 -CL-03) and 
osteoarthritis ( OA) (ZYN -CL-005).   
• ZYN2 -CL-03, a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multiple -dose study was 
conducted at 10 sites in Australia and 4 sites in New Zealand, to assess the efficacy and 
safety of ZYN002 administered as a transdermal gel to patients with focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  The results showed ZYN002 to be safe and well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with 
previous studies.  A total of 188 patients were randomized to receive either 195 or 390 
mg/day of ZYN002 or placebo for 12 weeks.  AEs were reported by 26 of 63 (41.3%) of placebo -treated patients, 31 of 63 (49.2%) of patients randomized to 195 mg/day of ZYN002 
and 32 of 62 (51.6%) of patients randomized to 390 mg/day of ZYN002.  For each dosing group, the majority of AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.  The TEAE that occurred more frequently in patients on drug than those on placebo and occurred in at least 2% of 
patients included: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, f atigue, application site 
dryness, application site pruritus, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, thermal burn 
(secondary to seizure related accident), decreased appetite, headache, ataxia, anxiety , and 
oropharyngeal pain.

ZYN002 to be saf e and well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previous studies.  
A total of 320 patients were randomized to receive ZYN002 at 250 or 500 mg/day or placebo 
for [ADDRESS_1001828] one treatment -emergent adverse event were 
similar between those on trial drug  (n=106, 50%) and those on placebo (n=45, 42%).  The

in at least at 2% of patients included:  headache, dizziness, application sit e dryness,

5.3.4. Ongoing ZYN002 Clinical Studies  
Two clinical studies are ongoing : 
• ZYN2 -CL-[ADDRESS_1001829] patient is expected to 
complete the extension phase in September 2019.  
Twenty -two patients were screened for the study and 20 were enrolled.  Of the 20 patients, 
18 completed the 12 weeks of open- label treatment and 13 of those 18 patients continued into 
the exten sion phase of the study.  Currently, 12 patients are ongoing in the extension phase. 
Initial results of the 12 -week treatment period include:  
Safety Results : Seventeen patients reported 33 TEAEs in this open- label trial.  The majority 
of TEAEs were mild (2 5 [76%]) or moderate in intensity (8 [24%]) and were considered 
unrelated to treatment with CBD (25 [76%]).  There were no SAEs reported, and 1/20 patients (5%) discontinued treatment due to a TEAE. 
The most common treatment emergent adverse event was mild -moderate gastroenteritis (6 
[18%]), not related to trial drug  and resolved during the study period.  This was followed by 
[CONTACT_383011][INVESTIGATOR_1092], viral infection, influenza, otitis media , and tonsillitis (7  
[21%], not related to trial drug  and all resolved during the study period.  One patient (129-
003) developed a moderate application rash [ADDRESS_1001830] above normal.  This patient currently is in the extension phase of the study.  
Other adverse events considered possibly related included symptoms of FXS (e.g., sensorial hyperactivity, nightmares, increased bedwetting and increase in self stimulatory talk).  
There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, EC G, clinical laboratory results 
(other than eosinophilia noted above) , and no reports of suicidal ideation for any patient 
throughout the trial.  
Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  35 Efficacy Results : Eighteen patients completed the efficacy assessments for this study through 
Week 12.  Validate d clinician - and caregiver -rated FXS scales were used to measure 
Baseline symptom severity and changes in symptoms between Baseline and Week 12 of the 
treatment period in this open- label trial.  
The primary endpoint was the change from Baseline to Week 12 i n the total score of the 
ADAMS, a caregiver -rated scale.  Compared to the Baseline total score, the ZYN002 treated 
patients had a 45.81% reduction ( p<0.0001) in the ADAMS Total Score.  Furthermore, 
ZYN002 treated patients had statistically and clinically s ignificant improvement compared to 
Baseline in all but one of the ADAMS subscales (i.e., Manic/Hyperactive Behavior, Social Avoidance, General Anxiety , and Compulsive Behavior) at Week 12.  A significant change 
was not observed for the Depressed Mood subsc ale of the ADAMS.   For other assessments, 
changes representative of clinically meaningful changes were observed, including in the ABC -FXS, PARS -R, and Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ). 
ZYN2 -CL-004 is an ongoing open -label continuation study to allow patients with  focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_733160] d ZYN2 -CL-03 to continue to receive ZYN002.  The primary objective is to assess 
the long -term safety and tolerability of ZYN002 in adult epi[INVESTIGATOR_733161] 18- month 
period.  The secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy  in this population.  Patients had to 
complete the 12 weeks of study treatment on protocol ZYN2- CL-03.  ZYN002 is being 
administered as a transdermal gel with all patients starting on ZYN002 at doses equal to or 
higher than those used in the blinded study – CBD 195 mg every 12 hours (Q12 H) ( +2 hours) 
(390 mg daily), with the option that after Month 1 to either increase or reduce the dose of 
ZYN002.  The dose may be increased to 292.5 mg Q12H ( +2 hours) (585 mg daily).  After one 
month at the 585 mg daily dose, the  Investigator  has the option to increase the dose to 390 mg 
Q12H ( + 2 hours) (780 mg daily).  Of the patients who completed the blinded 12- week phase, 
171 (98%) enrolled in the open- label extension study.  Results from patients who had completed 
3 (n=169) and 6 (n=63) months of treatment as of August 15, 2017, showed an approximate seizure reduction ranging from 30% (Month 3) to 65% (Month 6).  The un- blinded use of 
ZYN002 for an additional three and six months appeared to result in clinically meani ngful 
seizure reductions and was not due to an increase or addition of other AEDs.

7.4. Dose Schedule  
Following the Screening period, eligible patients will start a  single -blind Placebo Lead -In period 
for .  The placebo will be applied Q12H (± 2 hours).  For patients < [ADDRESS_1001831] of one sachet  of placebo containing 2.98 g of gel ( two sachets  in total per 
day).   For patients >  [ADDRESS_1001832] of two sachets  of placebo containing 
2.98 g of gel in each sachet  (four sachets in total per da y). 
At Visit 3, patients will be randomized to receive either ZYN002 or placebo.  In a blinded 
fashion, ZYN002 treated patients who weigh < 35 kg will receive 125 mg CBD Q12H  
(± 2 hours); total daily dose of 250 mg CBD.  Patients who weigh > 35 kg will rec eive 250 mg 
CBD Q12H ( +2 hours); total daily dose of 500 mg CBD.  All patients will remain on their 
assigned dose during the 12 weeks of the treatment phase of the study.  Study visits will occur at 
Week 4 ( Visit 4), Week 8 ( Visit 5 ), and Week 12 ( Visit 6 ).  Patients who have successfully 
completed the [ADDRESS_1001833] the option to enroll in an OLE  study.  
Patients not taking AEDs and not continuing in the OLE study will complete their EOS 
procedures at Visit 6 /ET.  P atients on AEDs who are not continuing in the OLE study will taper 
off trial drug and then have their EOS V isit.  Telephone Follow- Up calls will occur during the 
taper period and weekly for all patients who do not enter the OLE study for four weeks post the 
last dose of trial drug .  At Visit 2, parents/caregivers will be instructed on proper application of 
the study gel (active/placebo gel).   
  Parents/caregivers will apply all trial drug  to clean, dry, 
intact skin, thoroughly massaging it into the right and/or left upper arms and shoulders until the 
area is dry.  The study gel will be rubbed in completely and must be dry prior to dressing.  
 
  The application site should 
be covered to minimize sun exposure when going outside during the day.   Parents/caregivers will 

Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
Confidential  40 use gloves supplied by [CONTACT_733175].  If redness occurs at the application 
site, the parent (after consultation with the Investigator) may switch the application site 
temporarily to the upper thighs.  
7.5. Criteria for Study Withdrawal  
Each parent/caregiver and patient has the right to withdraw the patient or his/herself from the 
study at any time without prejudice.  If a parent /caregiver  or patient withdraws the patient  or 
his/herself  from the study, the reason(s) m ust be stated i n the CRF, and a final evaluation of the 
patient should be performed. 
The Investigator may discontinue any patient’s participation if he or she feels it is necessary for 
any reason during the study.  The Investigator and Sponsor may disconti nue any patient’s 
participation for any reason including: any adverse event, a positive endorsement on Question [ADDRESS_1001834] -study laboratory 
profile and follow -up safety exams should be obtained as soon after patient discontinuation as 
possible. 
All effort will be made to ensure that the ET procedures will be completed at the time of 
discontinua tion. 
Patients who discontinue after randomization and before study completion may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
7.6. Study Assessments  
7.6.1. Overview of Study Assessments  
Study procedures will be performed as summarized in the study schematic presented in Table 3 .  
As patients as young as 3 years old  will be enrolled in this study , parents/caregivers will play a 
significant role in the clinical trial.  M ost of the procedures will need to be performed by [CONTACT_31588]/caregiver, including trial drug  application  and routine site visits (monthly) as  required per 
the study protocol.  Parents/caregivers should make every attempt to bring the patient to their 
scheduled visits within the window allowed by [CONTACT_760] .  If there are visits where it is 
impossible for a patient to attend the site visit, the  parent/caregiver should contact [CONTACT_733190] a research nurse t o visit the patient at 
home.   
During the Screening Period, the site staff will review the eligibility criteria of the patient, 
review any medications including OTC  medications the patient is taking, obtain the patient’s 
medical history including their Fra gile X Diagnosis , any seizure history  and demographics, 
check their vital  signs, perform an ECG  (may be collected at either Screening or Visit 2) , assess 
Tanner S tage, perform a physical and neurological exam and a skin assessment, obtain some 
blood and urine for analysis, and administer assigned  scales.  Blood samples will be taken for 
hematology and chemistry testing, T testing (males only), pregnancy testing (if applicable), and 
CGG repeat analysis.  Patients will also have a pre -dose blood sample drawn for plasma levels of 
CBD and  THC testing, and AEDs testing (for patients using AEDs).  Urine will be collected for 
a urinalysis and drug screen.  The scales administered includ e the ABC -CFXS, ADOS -2® 
(ADOS® -2 will not be administered  at Screening if it has been administered  in the prior 6 
Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
Confidential  41 months and the results are available ), CGI -S, C-SSRS, MWC , PWC -20, VABS -3.  The 
parent/caregiver will also be asked the following question “What are the five behavioral, 
emotional, or social problems that most impacted your son/daughter and his/her family in approximately the past year? ”  This is referred to as  the “ Qualitative Caregiver reported 
Behavioral Problems Survey ”.  Optiona lly, if an IQ test was performed previously, those results 
may be provided to the Sponsor.   
Patients and parents/caregivers will be required to visit the clinic at Week - 2 (Visit 2), Study Day 
1/Week 1 (Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), Week 8 (Visit 5), and Week 12 (Visit 6) for vital signs, 
ECG  (may be collected at either Screening or Visit 2) , concomitant medication check, physical 
and neurological exams, Tanner Stage assessment, skin check examination, AE review including 
seizure assessment if applicable, and completion of the following questionnaires and scales: 
ABC -C
FXS, ADAMS, CGI -I, CGI- S, C-SSRS, Family Impact PedsQL  TM, MWC , PWC -20. 
In addition, parents/caregivers will complete a Caregiver Global Impression of Severity at 
Visit 2, Visit 3, and Visit 6/ET .  Parents/caregivers will also complete a Caregiver Global 
Impression of Change  at Visit 6/ET .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Aberrant Behavior Checklist -Community FXS Specific ( ABC-C FXS)  
The Aberrant Behavior Checklist- Community, 2nd Edition, will be scored using the FXS-
specific factoring system ( ABC -CFXS).  The ABC -CFXS will be completed by [CONTACT_31588]/caregiver, with support from the site staff, at Screening, Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5 , 
and Visit 6 /ET.  The ABC -CFXS asks responders to rate behaviors from “0 - not at all a problem” 
to “3 - the problem is severe in degree” across [ADDRESS_1001841] has been 
validated in a variety of clinical populations, including in FXS.  Scores will be analyzed using the FXS -specific factor structure such that 55 of the items resolve into 6 subscales (Irritability, 
Socially Unresponsive/Lethargic, Social Avoidance, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, and Inappropriate Speech; Sansone et al. 2012). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Autism Diagnostic Observation Sc hedule
® (ADOS®-2) 
The ADOS (Western Psychological Services) is a semi -structured assessment of communication, 
social interaction and play or imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having 
Fragile X or other pervasive developmental disorders from 12 months through adulthood (Lord et al. 2000).  The ADOS
®-2 consists of various activities to allow the observation of social and 
communication behaviors related to the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders.  The ADOS
®-[ADDRESS_1001842] will be administered one module.  
The assessm ent is administered by a certified rater and requires 35 to 40 minutes to complete.  
The ADOS®-2 is a diagnostic tool and this information will be used to document the presence of 
autism or other pervasive developmental disorders.  This assessment will onl y be administered at 
sites with qualified individuals based on the publisher’s criteria.  The ADOS®-2 will be 
completed at Screening  unless it has been administered  within the prior 6 months and the results 
are available.

The Anxiety, Depression , and Mood Scale will be completed by [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver, with 
support from the site staff, at Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5 , and Visit 6 /ET.  The ADAMS will 
be used as a comprehensive assessment of anxiety, depres sion, and mood among the FXS 
patients.  The ADAMS is comprised of 28 items, which are rated on a scale of “0 - not a 
problem” to “3 - severe problem.”  The ADAMS yields a total score as well as five subscale 
scores:  “Manic/Hyperactive Behavior,” “Depressed Mood,” “Social Avoidance,” “General Anxiety ,” and “Compulsive Behavior.”  The ADAMS has been validated in clinical FXS 
populations, and has demonstrated good internal consistency and test- retest reliability.  Interrater 
reliability has been show n to be satisfactory (Esbensen et al. 2003). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impressions Scale -Severity and Improvement  
The Clinical Global Impression Scales, Severity (CGI -S) and Improvement  (CGI -I), are 
commonly used in clinical trials  (Leigh et al. 2013) as they allow the clinician to utilize the 
history from the caregiver and incorporate the score into a clinical rating for the severity of symptoms.  CGI- S will be assessed at Screening , Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, and Visit 6 /ET 
to judge the severity of the symptoms of FXS at the onset of and throughout the study.  CGI -I 
will be  assessed at Visit 3 , Visit 4,  Visit 5 , and Visit 6/ET.   
CGI-S is a 7 -point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at 
the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis.  Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1  - normal, not at all ill; 2  - borderline mentally ill; 3  - mildly ill; 4  - 
moderately ill; 5  - markedly ill; 6  - severely ill; or 7  - extremely ill.  
CGI-I is a 7 -point scale that requires the clinician  to assess how much the patient's illness has 
improved or worsened relative to a Baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated 
as: 1 - very much improved; 2 - much improved; 3 - minimally improved; 4  - no change; 5  - 
minimally worse; 6  - much worse; or 7 - very much worse.  Information from bot h the clinician 
and the parent/caregiver  history are incorporated into a clinical rating . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Caregiver Global Impression of Severity and Change Scales  
Using a  Caregiver Global Impression of Severity scale, p arents/caregivers will be asked to 
complete a  scale rating the problems their child may be having with  
, and the child’s behavior overall at Visit 2, 
Visit 3, and Visit 6/ET .  Using the Caregiver Global Impression of Change scale, 
parents/caregivers will be asked at Visit 6/ET  to complete  
for the same question s asked in the Caregiver Global Impression of 
Severity  scale.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Family Impact PedsQL
TM (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) 
 
The Family Impact PedsQL ™ includes evaluations that are completed by [CONTACT_7071]/ caregiver.  
The scale will be completed at Visit 2, Visit 3 , and Visit 6 /ET.  The newly developed PedsQL™ 
Family Impact Module is a [ADDRESS_1001843] of pediatric chronic 
health conditions on parents and the family.  The PedsQL™ Family Impact Module measures 

Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.[ADDRESS_1001844] Module also measures parent -reported family daily activities and 
family relationships (Varni et al. 2004).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vineland Adaptive Behavior  Scales ™, Third Edition (V ABS -3) 
The VABS -3 (Sparrow et al . 2016) was designed to assess adaptive functioning from birth to age 
90.  The VABS -3 includes a comprehensive structured interview administered to a 
parent/caregiver, within which four key domains are assessed: Communication, Daily Living 
Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills, as well as Maladaptive Behavior (i.e., internalizing and 
externalizing).  The scale has been successfully used in clinical trials of pharmaceuticals in 
children and adolesce nts with FXS (Berry -Kravis et al. 2017).  The Adaptive Behavior 
Composite (a total score), the Communication, Daily Living Skills, and Socialization domains, 
as well as Maladaptive Behavior, will be evaluated in the present study.  The VABS -[ADDRESS_1001845] eted at Screening to assess baseline adaptive functioning.  
7.6.20. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  (Children’s Version)  
The C-SSRS (Children’s version)  is to be completed at Screening , all study visits  and any 
unscheduled visits .  The C -SSRS assessment will be conducted only if the patients are of an 
appropriate age (6 years or older) and capable of understanding and answering the questions in 
the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  For patients under the age of 6 or who are not capable of 
understanding and answering the questions in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the Investigator will consider the trend in ABC -Irritability  when assessing the risk of self -harm for an individual 
patient.  Note that any completed suicide or suicidal attempt will be collected as an SAE.   
7.6.21. Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist -  Short form  (MWC , Behavior Checklist ) 
The 15- item Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist – Short Form (Budney et al. 1999; 2003) 
retrospectively assesses cannabis withdrawal symptoms experienced during the past  week.  The 
symptoms included in the MWC consists of validated cannabis withdrawal symptoms: depressed 
mood, irritability, nervousness/anxiety, restlessness, increased aggression, increased anger, 
nausea, decreased appetite, stomach pains, shakiness/tremul ousness, sweating, sleep difficulty, 
strange/wild dreams, craving to smoke marijuana, and headaches.  The clinician will interview 
the parent/caregiver (or patient, if applicable), to  rate each of the 15 symptoms on a four -point 
Likert -type scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).  A composite Withdrawal 
Discomfort Score (WDS) is calculated as the sum of the MWC items known to be valid, reliable 
cannabis withdrawal symptoms (Americ an Psychiatric Association 2013).

Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  57 Option 1: Siblings may be randomized at the same time and participate in the study (i.e., 
concurrent ).  
Option 2: One sibling is randomized, completes t he 12 weeks of treatment, at which point the  
next sibling is randomized (i.e., sequential) . 
Option 3: Only one sibling is allowed to be enrolled and randomized.  No other siblings are allowed to participate.  
8.4. Patient  Withdrawal Criteria  
Each pa rent/caregive r and patient  has the right to withdraw  the patient  or him/herself  from the 
study at any time without prejudice.  If a pa rent/caregiver  or patient  withdraws the patient  or 
him/herself  from the study, the reason(s) must be stated i n the CRF, and a final evaluation of the 
patient should be performed. 
The Investigator may discontinue any patient’s participation if he or she feels it is necessary for 
any reason during the study.  The  Investigator and Sponsor may discontinue any patient’s 
participation for an y reason including: any adverse event, a positive endorsement on Question [ADDRESS_1001854] concentration is 4.2%. Dosing volume will 
be one (1) or two (2) sachets of 4.2% per day.  
Placebo will consist of a clear gel similar in appearance and texture to ZYN002.   The placebo 
will be supplied as a transdermal gel and will be contained in a sachet .  The gel will be applied to 
clean, dry, intact skin of the shoulders and  upper a rms or on a case by [CONTACT_733205].  Each application will consist of one or two sachets  of placebo containing 2.98 g of gel  
applied Q12H (+2 hours).  
SINGLE -BLIND PLACEBO LEAD -IN PERIOD 
During the single -blind Placebo Lead -In period ( ) patients < 35 kg will receive 
placebo, applied Q12H (± 2 hours).  Each application will consist of one sachet  of placebo 
containing 2.98 g of gel  (two sachets  in total per day).   Patients >  35 kg will receive placebo, 
applied Q12H (+2 hours).  Each application  will consist of two sachets  of placebo containing 
2.98 g of gel in each sachet (four sachets in total per day). 
STUDY DAY 1, RANDOMIZATION  
At Visit 3 (Study Day 1, Randomization) patients will be randomized to either: 
Treatment A (Trial Drug)  
Patients < 35 kg will receive 125 mg CBD applied Q12H  (± 2 hours); total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1001855] of one sachet  of ZYN002 CBD 4.2% concentration, 
containing 2.98 g of gel.  This dosing will continue for the duration of the study. 
Patients >  35 kg will 250 mg CBD applied Q12H (+2 hours); total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1001856] of two sachets  of ZYN002 CBD 4.2% concentration, each 
containing 2.98 g of gel.  This dosing will continue for the duration of the study. 
OR 
Treatment B  (Placebo)  
Patients < 35 kg will receive placebo, applied Q12H (+ 2 hours).  Each application (Q12H; + 2 
hours) will consist of one sachet  of placebo, containing 2.98 g of gel.  This dosing will continue 
for the duration of the study. 
Patients >  35 kg will receive placebo, applied Q12H (+ 2 hours).  Each application (Q12H; +2 
hours) will consist of two sachets  of placebo, each containing 2.98 g of gel.  This dosing will 
continue for the duration of the study. 
9.2. Concomitant Medications  
Because CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the major isoforms responsible for CBD metabolism, 
concomitant administration of drugs that inhibit these enzymes may result in higher exposure to 

Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  59 CBD and drugs that induce these enzymes may result in lower exposure to CBD; therefore, 
strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may increase or decrease the plasma concentrations of 
CBD and should be administered with caution.  
As a potential perpetrator, CBD would not cause a clinically signific ant induction of CYP 
isoenzymes.  However, CBD exhibited time -dependent inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, 
which was reversible, and of CYP3A4, which was irreversible.  Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index or risk for severe toxicity s hould be avoided until this risk has 
been assessed with ZYN002.  CBD did not inhibit human efflux and uptake transporters.  
Refer to the following site for examples of strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP 3A4 and CYP 3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic ind exes:  
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteracti
onsLabeling/ucm093664.htm . 
9.2.1. Concom itant Medications Allowed  
At the discretion of the investigator, patients will be allowed a short acting  sedative (such as 
midazolam) to assist with the collection of blood samples and ECG’s.  
Patients may take hormonal contraception and AEDs (not in the exclusion criteria) during study participation.  Other prescription or over -the-counter medications may be taken as approved in 
advance by [CONTACT_535764].  
AEDs may be added or discontinued as clinically indicated but patients on prior AEDs must remain on at least one concomitant AED in addition to ZYN002.  Only AEDs not listed in the exclusions may be used.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Psychotropic Medications  
Patients may only take one medication each to treat psychosis, anxiety or ADHD but may not take more than two medications total to treat all three conditions.  
Psychotropic medications include (but are not limited to) antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and ADHD medications.  
Since t here are no medications with an indication specific to Fragile X Syndrome, treatment is 
symptomatic and consists of medications approved for other indications.  The following clarifies which drug class es should be considered as psychotropic medications  as th ey relate to inclusion 
number 8:  
• Antipsychotics  
• Antidepressants  
• Anxiolytics (including buspi[INVESTIGATOR_733163])  
• Stimulants (e.g. methylphenidate)  
Patients  should be taking no more than two of the medications in the above classes and be on a 
stable regimen for four weeks prior to screening.  
  
Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  60  
For the purposes of the protocol, the following sedative medications , when used as a single, 
bedtime dose – need not  be considered one of the two allowed psychotropic medications:  
• Clonidine  
• Guanfacine  
• Melatonin  
• Diphenhydramine or other sedating antihistamine medications  
Clonidine or guanfacine administered in the morning or more frequently than once daily at 
bedtime would, however, be counted as one of the two permitted psychotropic medications.  There are certain medications used for their sedative properties that may ha ve more profound or 
long-lasting psychotropic effects, so these would need to be considered as one of the two 
permitted psychotropic medications, e.g.:  
• Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• Trazadone  
• Amitriptyline, or other tricyclic antidepressants  
Additionally, metformin nee d not be considered as a psychotropic medication for purposes of 
inclusion criterion number  8. 
9.2.2. Concomitant Medications Not Allowed  
The following medications are not allowed: midazolam*, oral ketoconazole, fluconazole, 
nefazadone, rifampin, alfentanil, alfuzosin, amiodarone, cyclosporine, dasatinib, docetaxol, 
eplerenone, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, halofantrine, irinotecan, lapatinib, levomethadyl, 
lumefantrine, nilotinib, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, ranolazine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, temsirolimus, toremifen e, tretinioin, vincristine, vinorelbine and St. John’s Wort.   
Patients may not take any benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_733164] *. 
* Except single doses administered for the purposes of obtaining blood samples and ECG’ s. 
9.3. Treatment Compliance  
The Investigator will keep a current and accurate inventory of all clinical supplies received from 
the Sponsor.  Any deviations from the protocol will be recorded.  
All pa rents/caregivers will be provided with a sufficient supply of trial drug  for the patie nt 
during their site visit.  A Replacement kit(s), containing the patient’s assigned trial drug, will 
also be supplied at each visit,  as needed during the study.  The Replacement kit(s) are to be 
returned at each study visit so that drug accountability can be performed.  The Replacement kits 
are to be used in situations where a visit is outside the visit window and the patient required 
additional trial drug prior to a visit and/or trial drug is inadvertently lost/damaged /destroyed.  
Parents/caregivers  will bring the used and unused sachets, in the appropriate study kit box  
(normal study supply kit and the Replacement kit) , to the site at each study visit.  The site will 
perform drug accountability (if all sachets were com pletely or partially utilized) at each study 
visit and record compliance for the previous visit.

Confidential  64 11.4. Method of Treatment Assignment or Randomization  
Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment according to a computer generated 
randomization scheme.  Randomization will be coordinated centrally through an interactive 
response system (IRT).  The system will provide patient identification numbers at Screening, which are subsequently linked to the treatment assignments at randomization.  Following 
completion of all evaluations at Visit 3, patients who meet all eligibility requirements and 
randomization criteria will be randoml y allocated to active or placebo treatment groups using a 
1:1 allocation ratio.  Randomization will be stratif ied by [CONTACT_547] (Male vs. Female) , weight ( ≤ 35 
kg vs. >  35 kg)  and region (North America vs. non -North America).  
11.5. Breaking the Blind  
This is a double -blind study.  During the conduct of the study, the patient, Investigator and study 
personnel at each center, and the S ponsor or its designated personnel directly involved in the 
clinical study will remain blinded to study treatment.  The Investigator will not be provided with 
the randomization scheme.  The randomization scheme will be maintained within the IRT.  The 
Investigator should contact [CONTACT_733206].   
 If a medical emergency occurs and a decision regarding the patient 's condition/treatment requires 
knowledge of the treatment assignment, the study blind may be broken for the specific patient  
via the IRT; the Investigator will immediately notify the Me dical Monitor of the situation.  The 
date, time, and reason for un- blinding must be documented in the source document and in the 
appropriate section of the CRF.  Additionally, the documentation received from the IRT  
indicating the blind break must be retained in a secure manner, in the patient ’s source 
documents.

Confidential  65 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
12.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety assessments will include collection of AEs including seizure assessment if applicable, 
physical and neurological examination, Tanner stage assessment, 12- lead ECG, clinical 
laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, C -SSRS, MWC , 
PWC -20, and findings from the skin irritation check s following treatment.  MADDERS will be 
used to systemically capture and adjudicate abuse -related events.   All patients who receive at 
least one dose of randomized trial drug will be included in the safety analysis.   
At the discretion of the investigator, patie nts will be allowed a sho rt act ing sedative (such as 
midazolam) to assist with the collection of blood samples and ECG’s.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, the Investigator will monitor each patient for evidence of drug intolerance 
and for the development of  clinical and/or laboratory evidence of an AE.  An AE assessment will 
be made by [CONTACT_2953] a routine basis at each study visit.  In order to standardize the 
approach to assessing the occurrence of AEs, the Investigator should make a judgement  as to any 
change in condition or AEs that were not present before trial drug  administration when he 
obtains the patient’s response to how they are feeling.  Patients having AEs will be followed until they return to normal or become stabilized. 
Investigators a nd study staff will be trained to recognize abuse, misuse and addiction.  They will 
be instructed to document all cases in which study drug is taken in a manner that deviates from 
the protocol, is unaccounted for, or is used by [CONTACT_733207].  In 
addition, MADDERS
® will be used to systematically capture and adjudicate abuse- related events 
in this study (Treister et al. 2016). 
All AEs that occur during the course of the study  (starting at the time the informed consent is 
signed)  mus t be reported in detail on the appropriate CRFs and patient’s source document record 
and on any other report form required by [CONTACT_17657].  All efforts will be made to follow -up 
events until resolution. 
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is an undesirable medical occurrence (sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, 
psoriasis) that occurs at any time after signing of the ICF whether or no t it is considered to be 
related to treatment.  Worsening of an existing medical condition is when a condition present at the time of signing of the ICF (e.g., cancer, diabetes, gout) becomes more severe, more frequent, 
or increased in duration during the study.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7757] (e.g., 
elective cosmetic procedures) or surgeries that were planned before entry into the study are not considered AEs.  AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF through the 4
th week  of the  
weekly follow -up phone call.

Confidential 66 The parents/caregivers of patients with a current epi[INVESTIGATOR_110330]/or seizure diagnosis will be asked 
at each  study visit if there has been any increase in frequency or severity of the patient’s seizures.  
If an increase in frequen cy or severity is noted, this will be recorded as an AE in the CRF. 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value represents for the patient a change from the time of signing of the ICF.  In 
general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgement ) should not be recorded as AEs.  Clinically significant changes occurring after the 
signing of the ICF are considered AEs; however, the reported adverse event should include the underlying diagnosis or resulting clinical sequelae.  Patients having clinically significant AEs will be followed until they return to normal or become stabilized.

[IP_ADDRESS].2. Pregnancy  
If a patient or partner of a patient becomes pregnant during or after exposure to the trial drug  
(within three months of trial drug  discontinuation) received in this study, the I nvestigator will 
immediately discontinue the patient from the study  (if patient is still on study)  and contact [CONTACT_12066].  The Investigator will complete the Sponsor’s (or designee’s) Clinical Pregnancy Notificat ion Form and alert  the Sponsor within two days of learning of the pregnancy.  
Diligent efforts will be made to determine the outcome for all pregnancy exposures in the clinical trial.  Information on the status of the mother and the child will be forwarded  to the 
Sponsor. 
Generally, follow -up will occur within six to eight weeks following the estimated delivery date.  
Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  Both maternal and paternal 
exposure will be collected.  For exposure involving the female partner of a male patient, the 
necessary information must be collected from the patient, while respecting the confidentiality of 
the partner.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_733165] m ay have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  

Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  67 The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even though the patient was 
discontinued from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs .  The date of onset of  the adverse event will be collected.  Also, the date of the 
resolution of the adverse event will be collected.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any adverse event that results in one or more of the following is considered a n SAE.  
1. Death  
2. Life Threatening -  The pa tient was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not 
refer to the hypothetical risk of death if the adverse event were more severe or were to progress  
3. In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (admission or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) .  
Planned  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_733166] a pre -existing condition or an inpatient stay required by 
[CONTACT_733208].  If there is any doubt whether the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_733167], it should be treated as serious and reported to the Sponsor.  
4. Persistent or significant disability / incapacity -  Any AE having an outcome that is 
associated with a substantial disruption of the ability to carry out normal life functions.  
This includes the inabi lity to work.  This is not intended to include transient interruptions 
of daily activities.  
5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect -  Any structural abnormality in patient offspring 
that occurs after intrauterine exposure to treatment.  
6. Other Medically Impor tant Events -  Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
event when, based upon medical judgement , they may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention t o prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Adverse Event (OAE)  
OAEs will be identified by [CONTACT_733209].  Significant adverse events of particular clinical importance, other than 
SAEs and those AEs leading to discontinuation of the patient from the study, will be classified as OAEs.  For each OAE, a narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report.  
12.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_102]/pa rent/caregiver  and/or in response to an 
open question from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7200].  Clinically significant changes as judged by [CONTACT_733210], blood pressure, and pulse will be reported as AEs.  A bnormal values that 
constitute an SAE or lead to discontinuation of administration of trial drug  must be reported and 
Protocol ZYN2- CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential 68 recorded as an AE /SAE .  Information about AEs /SAEs  will be collected from the signing of the 
ICF until the  last Telephone Follow- Up call.  The AE term should be reported in standard 
medical terminology when possible.   
For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset date, resolution date, intensity, 
causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the patient 
to discontinue the study. 
The relationship of the adverse event to the trial drug will be assessed using the following 
definitions: 
• Related (An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to trial drug or recurs on re-
challenge, and another etiology is unlikely).  
• Not Related (An adverse event is due to underlying or concurrent illness or effect of 
another drug and is not related to the trial drug (e.g., has no temporal relationship to trial drug or has a much more likely alternative etiology).  The alternative etiology will be recorded in the CRF. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468] [IP_ADDRESS].  An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the Sponsor’s (or designee’s) 
pregnancy form.  Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_49850] a contraceptive medication.  
The o utcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even though the patient was discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defe cts are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs. 
12.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
If any protocol defined expedited event, or serious AE occurs whether related to trial drug  
or not , the Investigator must notify the Sponsor within 24 hours by [CONTACT_19381] . 
24 Hour SAE Telephone:   
Email:   
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the signing of the ICF until the last T
elephone Follow -Up call .  Any SAEs considered related to the investigational product and 
discovered by [CONTACT_7201].  All SAEs must be 

Protocol ZYN2 -CL-016.[ADDRESS_1001857] ed on 
the SAE form with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy by e -mail to Zynerba.   
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be e -mailed  to Zynerba 
within one business day of receipt and this should be complete d on a follow -up SAE form and 
placed with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the CRF 
and/or study file. 
Zynerba is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events.  It is the 
Investigator’s  responsibility to notify the  Institutional Review B oard (IRB) or Independent 
Ethics Committee  (IEC) of all SAEs that occur at his or her site.  Investigators  will also be 
notified of all unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur 
during the clinical trial.  Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC of these additional SAEs.

Protocol ZYN2- CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential 71 14. STATISTICS  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved.  This document 
will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis 
methodology to address all study objectives. 
14.1. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size was estimated for the primary efficacy endpoint using Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (PASS 15) (NCSS, 2017).  Sample size requirements were based on a 
previous Phase 1/[ADDRESS_1001858] one dose of trial 
drug (which includes placebo run-in). 
The randomized safety analysis set will include all patients who receive at least one dose of 
randomized trial drug .  The randomized safety analysis will be the primary population for safety 
analyses.  Th e treatment group assignment for this population will be the treatment actually 
received.    
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all patients in the randomized safety analysis set who 
have both a baseline and a post -baseline ABC -CFXS assessment .  The FAS set will serve as the 
primary efficacy study population.  The treatment group assignment for analysis will be the treatment the patient was randomized to.  
The PK population will include all patients who have at least one sample collected during 
treatm ent and analyzed for determination of the CBD and THC concentrations.  
14.3. Efficacy Analysis  
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for 
continuous data and number (n) and percentage (%) for categorical data will be presented for all 
efficacy and safety parameters.  
All efficacy assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_21964].  
14.3.1. Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Null Hypothesis:  
The null- hypothesis to be tested is that there is no difference in effect between the active 
treatment group and placebo in the change from B aseline to Week [ADDRESS_1001859] -squares meant treatment difference (active -placebo), 95% confidence intervals 
around the least -squares ( LS) mean treatment differenc e and p -values for between treatment 
group tests.  MMRM will model the data specifying an unstructured variance- covariance 
structure.  Details will be presented in the SAP for situations where convergence is not met using 
the unstructured variance -covarian ce structure.   
14.3.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The k ey secondary endpoint , change from Baseline to Week 12 in  the ABC -CFXS Irritability, and 
ABC -CFXS Socially Unresponsive/Lethargic  subscale score, will be analyzed using the same 
MMRM approach as the primary endpoint.   
 
The CGI -I at Week 12/ET will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.   
 The response rate for the percent of patients who have ≥ 25% improvement  at Week 12/ET  from 
Baseline in the ABC -C
FXS Irritability , and ABC -CFXS Social Avoidance subscale score will be 
compared using the chi -square test and binomial confidence intervals.  
14.3.3. Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
All s econdary endpoints including change from Baseline in ABC -CFXS Social Avoidance, 
Irritability, Inappropriate Speech, Stereotypy  and Hyperactivity subscales scores and changes 
from B aseline in the  ADAMS t otal s core and subscale scores , will also be analyzed using the 
same MMRM approach as the primary endpoint.   
The st atistical comparison of active versus placebo for the CGI -I at weeks [ADDRESS_1001860].  The statistical comparison of active versus placebo for the CGI -S 
will be based on a covariate adjusted Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for the 
baseline score as the covariate.    
A patient will be considered as “improved” on the CGI -I scale if they are rated as “1 -very much 
improved” or “2 -much improved”.  All other ratings, including missing values, will be 
considered “not  improved”  (Guy 1976; Berry -Kravis et al. 2017).  The r esponse rates  for the 
percent of patients improved using CGI -I , and for patients having both ≥  25% improvement 
from B aseline in ABC - CFXS Social Avoidance subscale score AND improved on CGI -I scale 
will be compared using the chi -square test and binomial confidence intervals.   
Change from Baseline in Family Impact PedsQLTM will be analyzed using ANCOVA.  
ANCOVA models will contain fixed effects for treatment, region and study site with B aseline 
value f or the dependent variable of interest as a covariate.  
For MMRM/ANCOVA, descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_765], which will include LS 
mean, LS standard errors, LS m ean treatment difference (active- placebo) and associated 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and p- values for between treatment group tests.

AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_733211] e event and classified by [CONTACT_733212].  
Additionally, AEs will be tabulated overall (total number of AEs and total number of patients 
with AEs).   
MADDERS® will be used in this study to systematically capture and adjud icate abuse- related 
events. (Treister et al. 2016).  Data from the MADDERS® will be summarize and presented 
separately from other AEs.   
Symptoms of withdrawal will also be assessed by [CONTACT_733213]-20 from B aseline to Week 12/ET, weekly during the 
taper period and weekly for four weeks after the patient stops study drug.  
Vital signs assessments (actual and change from Baseline) will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presente d by [CONTACT_266142].  
Safety laboratory and urinalysis assessments (actual and change from Baseline) will be summarized by [CONTACT_733214].

Protocol ZYN2- CL-016.[ADDRESS_1001861] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/ DOCUMENTS  
15.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the stud y, a representative of Zynerba will 
visit the investigational study site to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Zynerba  or its representatives.  This will 
be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Zynerba  and the Investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Zynerba or representative will have regular contact [CONTACT_434133], for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s) . 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, data are being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product accountability checks are being performed . 
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the case report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for 
each patient (e.g. clinic chart s). 
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Zynerba . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs 
have been forwarded to Zynerba  and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been 
forwarded to the IRB /IEC. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the I nvestigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Zynerba, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics Committee 
or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of a Zynerba audit or inspection is to systematically and 
independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these 
activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according 
to the protocol, Good Clinical Practi ce (GCP) guidelines of the International Conference on 
Harmonization  (ICH) , and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The Investigator should

COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Due to the pandemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19), adjustments to the ZYN2- CL-[ADDRESS_1001865] until such time that restrictions for travel and attendance at study visits are 
lifted.  The specific modifications are described below.   
19.1. Changes to A llow for R emote Patient Visits 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, when patient and parent/caregiver travel is restricted and/or 
investigative sites have restricted patient visits, remote  patient study visits will be permitted.  
Zynerba has developed patient packets for the sites, corresponding to each remote visit, that will 
allow for many (but not all) of the study procedures to be performed remotely by [CONTACT_733218].  Those assessm ents that can be performed remotely include ABC -CFXS, ADAMS, CGI -S, 
CGI-I, Caregiver Global Impression of Change, Caregiver Global Impression of Severity, Family 
Impact Peds QLTM, C-SSRS, MWC, PWC- 20, skin assessment exam (if using Skype, Facetime, 
etc.), daily skin diary, check on concomitant medications and check on adverse events.  As with 
onsite visits, the clinician or site staff conducting the remote visit will read the caregiver the rating instructions before ratings are completed.  The site will witness the parent/caregiver 
completing the assessments when video visits are conducted.  The parent/caregiver will return 
the completed assessments, along with the skin irritation diary, to the investigational site, using pre-printed shippi[INVESTIGATOR_179269].  The site will then upload the completed questionnaires to the 
electronic system.  Safety assessments will all be conducted with the parent/caregiver on the phone or via video call.

To help ensure patient safety during the COVID-[ADDRESS_1001867] 
proximity to the patient.   
19.5. Shifting of Some Safety A ssessments to the Next Onsite Visit 
Since some of the patient visits will be completed remotely, several of the assessments normally 
done at an in- person visit will be shifted to the next onsite visit that a patient can attend.  These 
include ECG; targeted physical/neurological examinations, including Tanner stage assessments, 
if applicable; and vital signs.  Although the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_733168]2 -CL-016.05 26 April 2020 
 
Confidential  83 well-being  of the patient at remote visits, and assess for any new/increasing adverse events, the 
ECG, vital signs and targeted physical and neurological examinations will be deferred until the 
next visit on site.  Although local laboratories can be used for safety assessments, if a patient 
cannot travel to the closest local laboratory facility, the safety labs will be deferred to the next study visit.

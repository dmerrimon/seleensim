*PTC Definition
: 
All complaints that triggered an investigation by [CONTACT_775053]-related, patient- related, 
undetermined, or not related to device nor patient. In this study, 
a PTC is defined as any complaint reported on the Patient 
Complaint form that triggered an investigation by [CONTACT_775054]-related,  patient- 
related or undetermined,  whether or not associated with an AE. Of 
note, the complaints categorized as not related to device nor patient will not be considered as a PTC. This definition will be used for both 
primary and secondary endpoints. 
* In case a PTC is associated with the occurrence of an AE, the AE 
must be documented on an AE page in the electronic case report form (e-CRF) and the PTC must be described. In case a PTC is 
associated with the occurrence of a SAE, the SAE must be reported 
to the Monitoring Team in accordance with the SAE reporting 
procedures. 
ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE The study will consist of the following visits: 
• Visit 1 (between Week -2 and Week 0), screening visit, 
on-site visit. 
• Visit 2 (Week 0, D1): randomization, baseline visit, on-site 
visit. 
• Visits 3 through 11 (Week 1 through Week 15):  
- Visits 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11: PK sampling will be 
collected at these visits. These visits may be 
performed on site or as home-visits. 
- Visits 6 and 7 (Weeks 4 and 8): These visits may be 
performed on site or as home-visits. 
• Visit 8 (Week 12): end-of-treatment (EOT) Visit, on site  
• Visit 12 (Week 16): end-of-study (EOS) Visit, on site.   
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination No formal sample size was calculated for this study: sample size is 
based on empi[INVESTIGATOR_19637].  
Considering a drop-out rate of 10% it is proposed to randomize 
66 patients overall (33 in each group) in order to ensure 
60 evaluable patients overall (30 in each group) resulting in

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 7 180 unsupervised planned injections using SYDNEY. Patients in the 
AI group will switch to SYDNEY group at the time of the second 
injection; therefore, it will ensure to have [ADDRESS_1064514] and 4th unsupervised injections. 
With 60 evaluable patients using SYDNEY, a total of 180 unsupervised injections is ex pected to be achieved during the 
study. Expecting a maximum of 3 observed PTC over the 
180 injections (observed PTC rate of 1.67%) with SYDNEY, the 
upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated 
with the Wilson score method will be no higher than 5.2%. 
Analysis population The primary endpoint will be analyzed on the safety population of the 
single-arm period that will consist of all randomized patients who 
continue in the single-arm period (from Week 4, to Week 16), and receive at least [ADDRESS_1064515] (IMP ) during this period.  
Analysis of the primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint (ie, number (%) and type of 
SYDNEY-associated PTCs at th e unsupervised injections) will be 
described on the safety population for the single-arm period. The 
number and % of PTCs will be provided with the 95% CI using 
Wilson score method. If applicable, the number of PTCs per patient will be described. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
All secondary device-related endpoints will be analyzed on the safety 
population using descriptive statistics. In addition, 95% CI for the 
number of PTCs, number and % of patients with any PTCs will be provided using Wilson score method.  
Pharmacokinetics 
PK parameters and levels of PCSK9 (total and free) will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_331437]-injector device group. 
After the first administration onl y, for log-transformed maximum 
plasma concentration (C
max), area under the curve concentration 
versus time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-tau) and trough 
concentration (C trough) , the difference between auto-injector devices 
will be assessed using a linear fixed effects model. Estimate and 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means 
(SYDNEY/current AI) will be computed for C
max,  
AUC 0-tau and C trough.   
Anti-drug antibodies 
Results of ADA will be summarized by [CONTACT_331437]-injector device group 
using descriptive statistics. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Percent and absolute change from baseline in LDL-C will be 
summarized descriptively for each auto-injector device. 
At Week 4 only, statistical analyses will compare auto-injector 
devices using an ANCOVA model to determine the estimates and 
95% confidence intervals for t he difference between means of 
percent LDL-C change for AI versus SYDNEY.

The safety analysis will be based on t he review of the individual data 
and descriptive statistics. 
 
Adverse events will be classified using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred 
term. The number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE s) 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_331437]-injector device, as well as treatment-
emergent AESIs (including in particula r local injection site reactions 
LISR), treatment-emergent SAEs, TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation.
 
For vital signs and laboratory parameters, the number of patients 
with abnormalities and/or potentially clinically significant 
abnormalities (PCSAs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_331437]-injector device.  
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient)  Total study duration (per patient) is expected to be up to 18 weeks: 
• Up to 2 weeks of screening period 
• 16 weeks of study treatment period (auto-injector device 
assessment phase).

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to 
proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCS K9) across several species.  PCSK9 binds to 
low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) and pr omotes the internaliz ation and removal of 
LDLR on hepatocytes.  By [CONTACT_775058]9 from binding to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLR available to remove low- density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from 
circulation. Hence, alirocumab is an effective treatment to lower LDL-C and may reduce the risk 
for cardiovascular disease (CVD).  
Alirocumab (also referred to as SAR236553 and RE GN727) has been developed for the treatment 
of primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_775041] (CV) events. Alirocumab is approved in many countries, in particular 
in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and the European Union (EU).  
More detailed information is pr ovided in the latest version of Investigator’s Brochure. 
4.2 RATIONALE 
4.2.1 Study Rationale 
The 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) dosing regimen administered as 2 injections of 150 mg has 
been established as an effective, safe dosing regimen for alirocumab. In order to support the 
300 mg Q4W dosing regimen, a new auto-injector device (which is referred to as SYDNEY) with a volume of 2 mL has been developed. 
This larger volume device will allow delivering the 300 mg monthly dosing as a single injection 
of 2 mL of the 150 mg/mL alirocumab solution, rather than 2 separate injections of 1 mL of the 
150 mg/mL alirocumab solution with the currently marketed device. In this study, usability and 
acceptability of the large volume 2 mL SYDNEY de vice will be assessed when used by [CONTACT_775059]. The current 1 mL auto-injector device (which is referred to as AI,) will be used as a calibrator for pharmacoki netics (PK), efficacy and safety.  
In order to assess usability and acceptability of this new [ADDRESS_1064532] in the abdomen or thigh.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 23 4.2.2 Study description and design rationale  
The objective of this study is to assess the usability of SYDNEY in high or very high 
cardiovascular risk patients with hypercholeste rolemia not adequately controlled with their 
lipid-modifying therapy (LMT).  
Study population should include  patients with e ither heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
(heFH) or non-FH patients at high or very high  cardiovascular risk (i ncluding patients with 
coronary heart disease [CHD], non-CHD CVD, and other risk factors) , not  adequately controlled 
with a stable daily dose of atorvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg), or rosuvastatin (10 mg or 20 mg)  for at 
least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit, with or without LMT. 
This is a randomized, open-label,  16-week study, after a screening period of up to 2 weeks: 
Treatment periods include: 
• A parallel-arms period with one  of the 2  devices (SYDNEY or AI) for the first 4 weeks. 
Patients will be randomized to receive alirocumab 300 mg Q4 W, self-administered using 
either SYDNEY or AI  on Week 0 (Day 1) fo r the first injection, that will be done on site, 
under supervision and guidance of the Investigator or designee.  
• A single-arm period (with SYDNEY only) for the subsequent weeks until Week [ADDRESS_1064533] and 4th injections on Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12 respectively.  
The Week 4 and Week 8 injections will be  performed at home or on-site without 
supervision or guidance. The Week 12 injection will be performed at the site and will be under observation only; there will be no guidance provided. Therefore the Week [ADDRESS_1064534] self-injection to allow for the 
maximum use of SYDNEY in this study (ie, a total of 180 unsupervised injections to be 
performed with the new device), for the evaluation of  safety, efficacy and ease of use of the 2 mL 
device in all the study participants. 
The proposed design would support bridging the data for the alirocumab 300 mg monthly dosing 
regimen obtained with the currently marketed 1 mL AI to the new 2 mL SYDNEY. 
It also allows for a descriptive comparison of the two devices  up to Week 4 only (after the first 
dose) for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and safety (including local injection site 
reactions [LISR]).

5.2 SECONDARY  
Device-related:  
• To collect real-use (usability) data assessi ng the robustness and user interaction of 
SYDNEY and the current 1 mL alirocumab auto-i njector device  (which is referred to as 
AI)  in supervised settings on Week 0 (Day 1). 
Pharmacokinetics:  
• To compare alirocumab PK 300 mg Q4W administered using SYDNEY and AI, from 
baseline until Week 4. 
• To evaluate alirocumab PK 300 mg Q4W administered using SYDNEY, until Week 16. 
Anti-drug antibodies:  
• To evaluate the development of anti- drug (alirocumab) antibodies (ADA). 
Efficacy/pharmacodynamics:  
• To compare the percent and absolute change in LDL-C, from baseline to Week 4 using SYDNEY and AI. 
• To evaluate the percent and absolute change in LDL-C from baseline to Weeks 8, 12 and 
16, using SYDNEY.  
Safety:
 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of  alirocumab 300 mg Q4W, using both SYDNEY 
and AI.

arms (parallel-arm period) for the first 4 weeks, and then only one arm (single-arm period) for the 
subsequent weeks until Week 16.   
After a screening period of up to 2 weeks, all patients will be trained in self-injection using both 
devices at clinical site on Week 0 (Day 1)  before randomization. They will first receive 
paper-based training with each device  by [CONTACT_779]. They will then practice one injection with each 
device (SYDNEY and AI) into a training pad.  
Randomization will occur when training is completed and considered satisfactory by [CONTACT_779].  Eligible patients will then be  randomly allocated to receive alirocumab [ADDRESS_1064537] injection on Week 0 (Day 1). This 
injection will be performed at the s ite under supervision and guidance.  
Subsequently, from Week 4 (Day 29), all pa tients will receive alir ocumab [ADDRESS_1064538] and 4th injections on Week 4 (Day 29), 
Week 8 (Day 57) and Week 12 (Day 85) respectively.  The Week 4 and Week 8 injections may be perform ed at home or on site without supervision or 
guidance. The Week 12 injection will be performed at the site and will be under observation only; 
there will be no guidance provided by  [CONTACT_1719], and is therefore also  considered unsupervised. This observation will assess whether the self-injection is performed adequately with this information recorded in the e-CRF.  
On Week 0 (Day1), Week  1 (Day 8), Week 2 (Day 15), Week 3 (Day 22), Week 4 (Day 29), 
Week 8 (Day 57), Week 12 (Day 85), Week 13 (Day 92), Week 14 (Day 99), and Week 15 (Day 106), Week 16 (Day 113), PK collection, AE reporting, and co ncomitant medication 
reporting will be required. At th e above mentioned time points, the patient has a choice to 
complete the assessment at the st udy site or in the patient’s hom e (home visit).  Should a patient 
prefer that sample collection be done at home instead of at the site , a research nurse will visit the 
patient’s home to complete the required PK bl ood draw and management prior to the sample 
being shipped to the central lab.
 The Visiting Nurse will also bring the IMP and supplies 
(including diary) for the patient to administer unsupervised (the nurse will not provide any guidance or be in the room while the dose is self administered).  After the completion of the visit the Visiting Nurse will collect all study supplies and return them to the site. 
The Week 12 visit will be the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit. The Week 16 visit will be the 
end-of-study (EOS) visit.

The new 2 mL AI,  SYDNEY, is a two-step disposable auto-injector designed to deliver 2 mL of 
150 mg/ mL Praluent® (alirocumab) subcutaneously in ≤20 seconds. 
The main features of SYDNEY include: 
• An easy to use buttonless device for the patients  
• A needle safety cover that shields the needle at start of injection and extends to cover the needle when the AI is removed from the skin, which helps preventing needle stick injury 
• An inspection window to allow visibility of the medication and provide feedback before 
and after injection (window changes from transparent to purple) 
• Visible and audible cues to signal  the start and end of injection 
• A single-use, disposable device 
• Self-disabling feature to prevent re-use 
• An arrow around the inspection window (indicatin g the direction to push the pen against 
the skin) 
The main functional difference other than the injected volume between the new and the current device is that there is one step less for preparati on of the injection with the new device, there is no 
longer the need to push a button to start the injection. 
This new 2 mL AI, SYDNEY, is illustrated in Figure 2.

An Instructions for Use sheet will be provided to patients containing detailed instructions on use.  
The IMP will be administered by [CONTACT_6270]-injection. The us ed auto-injector will be returned to the site 
for accountability and reconciliation.  It is recommended that the IMP injections be rotated within an anatomical area (eg, right thigh 
then left thigh or right abdomen then left abdomen ).  Patients also have the option to inject in a 
different anatomical area (eg, th igh then abdomen) during the study. Patients should not inject into 
areas where the skin is bruised, tender, hard, red, or hot. 
It should be noted that if patie nts have problems activating the auto-injector by [CONTACT_775062] (eg, soft tissue), it is recommended to inject into the thigh, where 
the skin is firmer than the belly. If another concomitant drug is being injected at the same site planned for the IMP injection, then the patient s hould be advised to use an alternate location for 
administration of the IMP. 
Patients will be asked to store the IMP in a refrige rator. Prior to administration, the IMP should be 
set outside in a safe location at room temperature for about [ADDRESS_1064543] receive paper-based training with each device by [CONTACT_1719]. They will then practic e one injection with each device (current and new

Before randomizing a patient, the Investigator or designee will have to contact [CONTACT_179621] (IRT). 
A randomized patient is defined as  a patient who is registered a nd assigned with a treatment kit 
number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file. A 
patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study. If a treatment is used without 
contact[CONTACT_179622] (IRT), the patient will be considered as not 
randomized and withdrawn from the study. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
The treatment kit with AI will be prepared to contain 2 auto-injectors (2 x 1 mL) whereas the treatment kit with SYDNEY will be prepared to contain 1 auto-injector (1 x 2 mL).  
In addition to the open-label trea tment kits, a dummy kit for prac tice containing 1 auto-injector 
each will be prepared for the purpose of instruc ting patients on injection administration which is 
to be performed prior to randomization. These trai ning injections will be performed on site at 
randomization Week 0 (Visit 2, Day1). 
Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
At the investigational site, stored IMP should be  kept in an appropriate locked room, under the 
responsibility of the investigator or designee or other authorized person in accordance with local 
regulations, labeling specifications, policies and procedures. Control of IMP storage conditions, 
especially control of temperature (eg, refrigerated storage between +2°C and +8°C [36°- 46° F] at the site) and information on in-use stability and in structions for handling the alirocumab should be 
managed according to the rules provided by [CONTACT_3433] e Sponsor (eg, the temperature of the site 
refrigerator should be checked daily and recorded on a log sheet). 
IMP will be either given to the pa tient for self-administration while  on site or the supplies will be 
brought and collected by [CONTACT_775064].   
The IMP must be administered in accordance with the Instructions for Use. If the storage and in 
use conditions described in the Instructions for Use are not followed, do not administer the IMP.

as specified by [CONTACT_328730]. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Clinical Trial Protocol and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labelin g, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be record ed through a complaint procedure (see Section 6.1) . 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by [CONTACT_429]. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to reca ll the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for the Visiting Nurse who has been approved by [CONTACT_1034]), allow the IMP to be used other than as directed by 
[CONTACT_775065], or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
IMP administration data will be recorded by [CONTACT_775066] e-CRF. 
Measures taken to ensure and document IMP co mpliance and accountability are described below: 
• The Investigator or designee will obtain via IRT the treatment kit number(s) and he/she 
will dispense the treatment kit(s) to the patient. 
• The Investigator or designee will enter the treatment kit packaging number(s) and the kit 
numbers in the e-CRF, if applicable. 
• The accountability is to be performed at IMP kit re-supply visits only. The used and unused kit(s) should be brought back to such visits for accountability purposes. 
• The monitor will check the data consistency between e-CRF pages, treatment log forms using patient’s diary, and returned unused IMPs of a corresponding kit. 
The patient will be instructed on the importance to take the study treatment as planned for the 
remainder of the treatment duration, as well as the need to return all used and unused IMP kits at each site visit.

9.2.4 Efficacy/Pharmacodynamics assessments: 
The efficacy secondary endpoint is represented by [CONTACT_775071]-C at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16. 
At all visits LDL-C will be calculated using the Friedewald formula ( 3). For the purpose of 
calculating LDL-C through the Friedewald formula, blood sampling will be done for 
determination of  Total- cholesterol (Total-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and 
TG.  If TG values exceed 400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L) then the central lab will reflexively measure (via the beta quantification method) th e LDL-C rather than calculating it. 
The blood sampling for lipid parameters should be performed in the morning, in fasting condition 
(at least [ADDRESS_1064554] and refrain from sm oking). Alcohol consumption within 48 hours and 
intense physical exercise within 24 hours pr eceding the blood sampling are discouraged. The 
sample handling procedure will be provided separately in a Central Lab manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamic parameter 
The pharmacodynamic endpoint will be the perc ent change in LDL-C value from baseline to 
Week 4 defined as: 100x (LDL-C value at Week 4 - LDL-C value at baseline) / LDL-C value at 
baseline. 
The baseline LDL-C value will be the last LDL-C level obtained before the first injection of IMP. 
The LDL-C at Week 4 will be the LDL-C level obtained within the Week 4 analysis window.

be used in the analyses if appropriate accordin g to above definition and analysis windows used to 
allocate a time point to a measur ement. Analysis windows will be defined in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). In case both calculated and measured LDL-C are provided for the same 
sampling, the measured LDL-C will be considered. 
Percent and absolute change from baseline in LDL-C will also be calculated at Week 8, [ADDRESS_1064555] or observed by [CONTACT_737], will be 
monitored at each visit. This includes SAEs, detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS], AEs of special interest 
(AESIs) detailed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS], laboratory data, vital signs assessed throughout the study. 
Specific additional forms will be completed for AESI. For any Local Injection Site Reactions (LISR), and general allergic AEs, whether or not reported as AESI, special forms on symptoms 
will have to be completed (see  Section 10.6). 
Assessment of safety will be based on clinical safety endpoints,  laboratory safety variables, vital 
signs, and physical examination.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events 
Refer to Section 10.4 up to Section  10.7 for details. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory safety variables 
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood analysis including the following:  
• Hematology: red blood cell c ount, hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cell count with 
differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils , basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes), 
platelets.

The primary endpoint is the number (%) and types of PTCs associated with the use of SYDNEY 
during the 3 unsupervised injections at Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12. This will allow to assess 
the robustness, usability and acceptability of the new 2 mL SYDNEY device. With an estimation of 60 evaluable patients using SYDNEY ([ADDRESS_1064557] injection), a  
total of 180 unsupervised injecti ons with SYDNEY will be assessed. 
The data collected will also allow for evaluation of PK, safety, efficacy and use in real world setting of the 2 mL SYDNEY device in all study participants, from Week 4 injection. 
Up to Week 4, the parallel arm design will allow for PK, PD and safety (including LISR) to be 
compared between SYDNEY and AI.

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
• Pregnancy will lead to definitive treatment discontinuation in all cases. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1064567](s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by [CONTACT_56476]. Reinitiation of trea tment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and 
or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IM P(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event 
was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section 10.3.3 and  
Section 10.3.4). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by [CONTACT_326920] e-CRF.  
Temporary treatment discontinuation is defined as one or more sche duled injections that are not 
administered to the patient as decided by [CONTACT_737] 
(electronic

Clinical Trial Protocol  20-Nov-2017 
SAR236553-MSC14864 - alirocumab Version number: [ADDRESS_1064568](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
Patient withdrawal from the stud y treatment or study should be avoided as much as possible. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1064569] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the e-CRF.  
Patients should discontinue IMP for the following reasons: 
• Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no longer using effective contraceptive method of 
birth control (females only). 
• Acute injection reaction of clinical concern. 
• Serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction considered related to IMP. 
• At patient request, ie, withdrawal of consent for treatment. 
• If, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation with the administration of the IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient's well-being. 
• Intercurrent condition that requi res discontinuation of the IMP. 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
Any abnormal laboratory value w ill be immediately rechecked for confirmation (after 24 hours) 
before making a decision of permanent discon tinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1064570]  dosing day with the IMP (this EOT visit should 
take place within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possibl e) including a PK sample, if 
appropriate.  
The patient, at a minimum, should then be followe d-up for [ADDRESS_1064571] 4 weeks after the premature discontinuation.

wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain in the study. If possible, the patients are 
assessed using the procedure nor mally planned for the EOS vi sit including a PK sample. 
The Investigators should discuss with them key visits to attend. The value of all their study data collected during their continued involvement will be emphasized as important to the public health value of the study. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE information elicited should be documented.  
All study withdrawals should be recorded by [CONTACT_56479] 
e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, 
at least the date of the withdrawal  and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, unless the patient withdraws consent for follow-up, the Investigator should make the best effort to rec ontact the patient (eg, contact [CONTACT_4676]’s family or 
private physician, review available registries or health care databases), a nd to determine his/her 
health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_56480]’s records (eg, times an d dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt 
for sending a registered letter). 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be rerandomized in the study. Their inclusion 
and treatment numbers mu st not be reused.

A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
Medical and scientific judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether expedited

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 59 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an AE (serious or nonser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by [CONTACT_56481] e Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added, modified or removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548]. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) are AEs (serious or non-serious) that need to be 
monitored, documented, and managed in a pre-specified manner describe d in the protocol.  
For these AEs, the Sponsor will be informed immediately (ie within 24 hours), as per SAEs 
notification described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding screens in the e-CRF. The following AEs are considered as AESIs in the study: 
• Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner 
of a male patient entered in the clinical trial.   
- It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued.  
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female partic ipant or in a female partner of a male 
participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined. 
• Symptomatic overdose  (serious or nonserious) with IMP/NIMP 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event suspected by [CONTACT_775077] (not base d on systematic pi[INVESTIGATOR_12988]) and defined as at least twice the intended dose within the intended therapeutic interval 
- Of note, asymptomatic overdose has to  be reported as a standard AE. 
- The circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) shoul d be clearly specified in the 
verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms.  
• Increase in alanine transaminase (ALT): ALT ≥[ADDRESS_1064573] (if baseline ALT <ULN) or 
ALT ≥2 times the baseline value (if baseline ALT ≥ULN) (see the “Increase in ALT” flow 
diagram in Appendix E. 
• General allergic events:  
- Any general allergic events regardless of the cause that require consultation with 
another physician for further evaluation of hypersensitivity/allergy as per the Investigator’s medical judgment should be reported as an AESI.  
- All general allergic events require completion of the specific e-CRF screen.

judgment should be reported as an AESI.  
All LISR require completion of the specific e-CRF screen. 
Note:  - Other LISR are non-AESIs. Please see Section 10.6 for details. 
- The safety instructions on allergic events and LISR are detailed in Section 10.6. 
• Neurologic events : neurologic events that require additional examinations/procedures 
and/or referral to a specialist should be reporte d as an AESI. If the event does not require 
additional examinations/procedures  and/or referral to a specia list, it should be reported as 
a standard AE. 
• Neurocognitive events:  All neurocognitive events will be considered as AESI.  
10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature [CONTACT_206411] [CONTACT_181286], are to be recorded  on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of 
the e-CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, 
and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_179646](s).  
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_400335]. 
Patients who experience an ongoing SAE or an AESI, at the prespecified study end-date, should be followed until resolution, stabiliza tion, or death and re lated data will be 
collected.  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient, at a minimum, should then be 
followed-up for [ADDRESS_1064574] 4 weeks after the premature discontinuation.

10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at leas t reasonably related to the IMP (S[LOCATION_003]R), to 
the regulatory authorities, Independent Ethics Committee (IECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) as appropriate and to the Investigators.   
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory authorities, according to local regulations. 
Adverse events that are considered expected will be specified by [CONTACT_326927] (Investigator’s brochure). 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report. 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Local tolerability (local injection site reactions) 
In case the Investigator or the patient recognizes any signs of local intolerability, then this should 
be treated and followed-up as per the Investigator ’s medical judgment. Specific e-CRF screens are 
to be filled in. Information on classifying the reaction is provided in Section 10.4, and on 
reporting these reactions is given in Appendix G . 
Local injection site reactions that are related to the alirocumab injection, as opposed to another injectable agent, should be furthe r characterized by [CONTACT_361571], pain, etc. If the patient experiences a local injection site reaction with no signs or symptoms except for erythema/redness, and/or 
swelling, and the diameter of the erythema/ redn ess, or swelling measure <2.5 cm, no AE for local 
injection site reaction needs to be reported as this  is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] a clinically important 
finding. However, if the patient has a reaction of swelling with a diameter <2.5 cm that interferes 
with activity, then it should be considered as a clinically relevant findi ng and should be reported 
as an AE with a corresponding grade of moderate or severe, in accordance with Appendix G.

Specific e-CRF screens are to be filled in to assess allergic AEs or allergic-like AE that may occur 
during the clinical studies conducted with alirocumab. Sometimes tran sient injection site 
reactions, irritant in nature, may occur, re quiring no intervention and being of dubious 
significance. These reactions would not be considered to be allergic reactions. Adverse events that may constitute an allergic reaction (eg, generalized itch, nasal itch, swelling at injection site, flushing, hives, swelling at lips, eyes, face, tongue, hands, feet, lump in throat, difficulty to swallow, hoarseness, change in pi[INVESTIGATOR_179579], incapacity to speak, wheezing, chest tightness, 
stridor, etc) should be considered to be reported on the General Allerg ic Event and/or Local 
Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form. 
Adverse events that are obviously not of allerg ic origin (eg, LISR related to mechanics of 
injection) should only be recorded on the Loca l Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form. 
However, injection site reactions that prog ress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated as 
recommended in Appendix G and General Allergic Reaction Complementary form should be 
completed. The IMP should be immediately interrupted (temporari ly discontinued) if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_56392]. See Section 10.3.1 for further information on treatment 
interruption and Section 10.3.3 for criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic adverse event with cutaneous involvement 
Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic origin or injection 
site reactions which progress/ex pand/worsen/etc. should be evalua ted by a dermatologist as soon 
as possible, and preferably within one week of  the site first becoming aware of the event. 
The Investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc) and 
extracutaneous symptoms and signs. An unscheduled assessment for hematology, chemistry, liver 
panel, and PK should be obtaine d. An additional blood sample w ill have to be drawn for anti-
alirocumab antibody analyses (adequate instructions will be provided to the site by [CONTACT_35717]). If it is possible, the site will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_415053]’s visit. If the photos ar e obtained, then copi[INVESTIGATOR_775046]. The Investigator will provide a summary of the patient's case, reason for consultation, a nd information being requested to the consulting 
dermatologist.  
A full consultation report should be sent by [CONTACT_56488]. The full report 
should contain, at a minimum, the following informa tion; a detailed descrip tion of the rash (such 
as the morphology [lesion type], shape of indivi dual lesions, arrangement of  multiple lesions [eg, 
scattered, grouped, linear], distribution, color, consistency, presence of pruritus or pain, and other clinical signs) and in case a skin biopsy (inc luding histopathology a nd immunofluorescence) was 
done (if it was deemed necessary as per the dermat ologist’s or Investigator’s medical judgment), 
the results of this investigation with, if applicab le, a specific diagnosis of the AE. The Investigator 
will fax the full report and the corrected AE fo rm if necessary, to the Monitoring Team 
Representative within 24 hours.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 65 [IP_ADDRESS] Acute allergic injection reactions 
Acute allergic injection reaction (which are cons idered under the category of general allergic 
events) is defined as any AE that occurs during or shortly after injection of the IMP (characterized 
by [CONTACT_775078], bronchoconstriction, ur ticaria, edema, angioedema, nausea, 
vomiting). Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these potential adverse 
effects (eg, antihistamines, bronchodilators, IV saline, corticostero ids, acetaminophen, and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) must be available for immediate use for the injections at the training, and inclusion visits. Patients will be observed at the investiga tional site for at least [ADDRESS_1064579] at the in clusion visit. Patients should be  treated symptomatically if any 
AEs are observed. Patients are to rema in at the site until any acute in jection reaction is assessed as 
stable, per the Investigator’s discretion.  
A General Allergic Event and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form will have to 
be completed.

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
No formal sample size was calculated, the samp le size is based on em pi[INVESTIGATOR_19637]. 
Considering a drop-out rate of 10% it is planned to randomize 66 patients overall (33 in each 
group) in order to ensure 60 evaluable patie nts overall (30 in each group) resulting in 
[ADDRESS_1064580] before the second injection.  With 60 evaluable patients using SYDNEY, a total of 180 unsupervised injections is expected to be achieved during the study. Expecting a max imum of 3 observed PTC over the 180 injections 
(observed PTC rate of 1.67%) with SYDNEY, the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval calculated with the Wilson score method will be no higher than 5.2%.   
11.2  DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
Screened patients are defined as any patient who met the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria, and signed the informed consent. 
Randomized patients are all screened patients with  a treatment kit number allocated and recorded 
in the IRT database, regardless of whether or not the treatment kit was used. These patients form 
the randomized population. Patients treated without being randomized will not be considered as randomized. 
The safety experience of patients treated and not randomized will be reported separately, and 
these patients will not be incl uded in the safety population. 
11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Modified intent-to-treat populations 
The primary efficacy analysis population that will be used for the analyses of LDL-C will be the 
modified intent-to-tr eat (mITT ) population.  
The mITT population of the parallel arms period will consist of all randomized patients who 
receive at least [ADDRESS_1064581]. Patients in this mITT population will be analyzed according to the auto-injector 
device group allocated by [CONTACT_17628] (ie, as-randomized treatment group).

No duration of IMP exposure will be calculated for the parallel-arms period since patients will receive only one injection during this period. The proportion of patients having received the first 
injection will be summarized. 
The duration of IMP exposure for the single-arm  period is defined as : last IMP injection 
date - first IMP injection date during this period + 28 days (regardless of unplanned intermittent 
discontinuations). The number of injections received during the single-arm period will also be summarized.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Compliance  
No treatment compliance to the IMP will be calculated for the parallel-arms period since patients will receive only one injection during this period. 
Treatment compliance to the IMP for the single-arm period will be assessed using the mean 
injection frequency, defined for each patient, as the average number of days between 2 consecutive injections, that is: (last injection date – first injection date during this period)/(number of injections -1) for patients receiving at least 2 injections during this period.

treatment-emergent AESIs,  and TEAEs leading to treatment discontinua tion, will be summarized 
based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding of verbatim terms 
reported by [CONTACT_431] ( Section 9.2.5). 
All safety analyses will be performed using the following common rules: 
• The observation period to be used for the safety population is the TEAE period. The 
TEAE period is defined  
- For the parallel-arms period as the time from the first IMP injection to the day before 
the second IMP injection (for patients entering into the single arm period period) or to 
[ADDRESS_1064586] IMP injection. 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, and vital signs: 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by [CONTACT_181295]/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by  [CONTACT_326932], and vital signs. 
• Potentially clinically signif icant abnormality criteria will de termine which patients had at 
least 1 PCSA during the TEAE period, taking into account all evaluations performed, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage.

2. 1 Collection/Handling/Processing of Samples  
Collection schedule 
Per protocol 
PK Serum Sample Collection and Preparation  
• At intervals stated in the clinical stud y protocol, whole blood from subjects will be 
collected in 5-mL red-top vacutainer tubes (US B-D Cat #367814, European B-D Cat 
#369032) containing clot activator and no additional additives or anti-coagulant for PK 
SERUM sample preparation.  
• Collect 5 mL blood directly into 5-mL red- top vacutainer tube and invert 5 times. 
• Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes.   
• Centrifuge at approximately 1200 x g for 15 minutes to separate clot from serum. 
• Within 30 minutes after centrifugation, draw o ff serum very slowly w ith transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], 
approaching no closer than 0.5 cm of the buffy coat and taking great care not to disturb the 
buffy coat (any contamination may invalidate the assay).   
• All cryovials must be properly labeled with labels provided by [CONTACT_775087].  
• Aliquot approximately equa l volumes of serum into TWO separate 1.8-mL plastic 2D 
barcoded cryovials, one for the primary aliquot  and one for the duplicate aliquot.  Do not 
exceed 1 mL of serum into each cryovial. Use one of the approved cryovials listed below. 
- Nunc Item # 374502 
- VWR: Catalog # [ZIP_CODE]-708  
- ThermoFisher/[LOCATION_003] Scie ntific: Catalog # 12590007 
• Freeze all cryovials immediately.  All serum samples must be stored in a -20° C or colder 
freezer that does NOT auto-defrost until the next earliest shipment. For long-term storage, 
all serum samples should be st ored in a -80° C freezer. 
- Note:  If the site does not have a -20 °C or colder freezer that does NOT 
auto-defrost, ship the serum samples on dry ice on the day of collection to CRO.  
• Sites must ship the primary aliquot in a separate shipment from the duplicate aliquot.

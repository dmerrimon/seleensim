January [ADDRESS_723864] increasingly interacted 
and/or reviewed patients social media activity. This project seeks to harness social media data in a 
clinical mental health setting by [CONTACT_550959]. We will work with 
these two groups to create social media and digital data dashboard that can be shared before or during 
clinical encounters. Our objective is to explore and evaluate how a patient -centered personalized social 
media summary dashboard could be used in a behavioral health therapy session to improve depressive 
symptoms and anxiety and if a social media dashboard improves patient and provider therapeutic 
alliance and engagement.  
 
Background  
Last year, approximately  [ADDRESS_723865] the accuracy, 
completeness and quality of the information the patient shares with his/her thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Poor accuracy of 
this communication then can affect the quality and outcomes of therapy. In some cases, changes in 
mood and adverse life -threatening events may be missed. It is not uncommon for patients to share 
written communication (e.g. a letter)  with their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550948] a third 
party. These artifacts can be helpful to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550949].  It is increasingly likely 
that this written communication will be electronic. Electronic communication, including emails, texts 
and social media, are now ubiquitous in our society. Approximately 2.4 million emails are sent per 
second, 22 billion texts per  day. More than 79% of US adults actively use Facebook and use across other 
platforms like Twitter and Instagram is growing exponentially. These communications may offer an 
exciting way to support the effectiveness of mental health treatment. They can offe r insight into 
patients mood, thoughts, lifestyle, and behavior that may not be available otherwise. This area of study 
raises several questions such as: How can clinicians best make use of the huge volume of raw, 
unstructured data that are available throu gh social media and electronic communication (i.e. texts, 
emails)? How do therapi[INVESTIGATOR_550950], without disrupting the 
therapeutic process? We strongly believe that there will be value in linking individual level info rmation 
on social media to health outcomes and behavior; a better understanding actual patient willingness to 
share online data output could help to significantly improve our understanding of applications of digital 
data for health research. Our assumption  is that ultimately this information will have tremendous utility 
for supporting more measurement -based care. In our ongoing work at Penn (Penn IRB 819442) we have 
enrolled over 6000 patients to share access to social media and EMR data. Of individuals who  use social 
media and are willing to participate in research, approximately 85% of patients agree to share social 
media and EMR data. To date we have used this data to predict differences in medical diagnoses (e.g. 
hypertension, depression). We have also g enerated patient dashboards of general information about 
their health and social media use (Penn IRB: 819442)

 4 treatment (having a digital health dashboard to be used at least two therapy sessions over a 2 -month 
period) or the control (usual care). Participants who consent to share their socia l media and digital data, 
we will use a Facebook application previously designed for this purpose, Instagram API [INVESTIGATOR_550951], 
and Google take -out file. Patients will visit on an incognito browser https:// 
donate.centerfordigitalhealth.upenn.edu to safel y and securely download social media and digital data. 
The data collection platform was reviewed by [CONTACT_550960], please approval attached to this 
submission. Participants who agree to share their social media data will log in to their own Faceboo k 
account and download an application. When users first activate the application, they grant the right to 
researchers to access the information contained in their Facebook profiles. They will then be directed to 
a Facebook application called Penn Image Sta tion that was designed for the purposes of this study. The 
Penn Image Station application will gather information from their Facebook public profile, status 
updates, personal description, and likes. The application will not affect their usual use of Facebo ok nor 
will it post to their page. Facebook data will be collected historically (all data that ever existed) and 
prospectively for 60 days. If they share their Google take -out, they will download a zip file of their 
google searches and YouTube activity. Go ogle take -out data is only historical and retrospective. If the 
participant shares their Instagram posts, they will be directed to an Instagram application called Penn 
Social Mediome. They will read a brief statement, either agree or disagree with the stat ement, and then 
log on to their Instagram account. Their Instagram posts and photos will be extracted by [CONTACT_550961] 60 days prospectively. No passwords would 
be collected by [CONTACT_3476]. Patient participants will be asked to download AWARE, a free app on 
their smartphone. AWARE is an Android framework dedicated to instrument, infer, log and share mobile 
context information, for application developers, researchers and smartphone users. AWARE captures 
hardware -, software -, and human -based data. The data is then analyzed using AWARE plugins. AWARE is 
compatible on iPhone, Android, and Google phones. The use of the AWARE app in Penn research 
projects has been previously approved IRB #[ZIP_CODE], The N etworks of Daily Experiences (NODE) Study: 
Within -Person Change in Curiosity and Implications for Well -Being, (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_375303] S. Bassett, Ph.D). When

from social media and wearable device platforms and aggregate to develop dashboards. Qualitative 
analysis using grounded theory will be applied for the focus group discussion, interviews,  and open -

randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of their adherence 
with the entry criteria, regardless  of the treatment they actually received, and regardless of subsequent 
withdrawal from treatment or deviation from the protocol. Baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics will be reported as frequency and percent for categorical variables and media n and 
interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. We will compare baseline characteristics between 
intervention and control arms using t -tests for continuous variables and chi -squared tests for categorical 
variables. The goal of these comparisons w ill be to determine if the two arms are balanced on baseline 
variables after randomization. For the primary analysis, we will use linear mixed effects models to assess 
whether average of SF [ADDRESS_723884] (as participants will 
be randomized within therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]), by [CONTACT_550963][INVESTIGATOR_11437]. The primary parameter of interest will be a binary indicator for treatment 
arm assignment. Models will also include a variable for time of measurement. Baseline covariates that 
are found to be unbalanced between arms may be adjusted for in the model if they were deemed to be 
potential confounders a priori to adjust for potential confounding and for efficiency gain. We will use all 
available SF [ADDRESS_723885] to missing outcome measures as long as

disclosure by [CONTACT_550970]. Sp ecifically, the research 
team will not review social media data to determine disclosures of suicidal, homicidal, or child abuse 
information that will be acted on by [CONTACT_5051]. Data collected for analysis is detailed in the 
informed consent form and  specifically indicates: Data extracted from Facebook will include but not be 
limited to past and future content: age, gender, language, photos, News Feed content, work history, 
education history, hometown, interests, relationship status, current city, rel igious or political views, 
number of friends, items liked, and number and status updates. Data from Twitter will include: handle, 
number of followers/following, tweets, geography, time/date, profile. Data from Instagram will include 
username/ handle, numbe r of posts, engagement metrics, messages, and photos. The use of REDCap 
will also help minimize the risk of confidentiality. Additionally, the survey items are expected to cause no 
to minimal emotional distress. We do not expect physical, emotional, econom ic, psychological or 
societal harms that may accrue to others not in the trial. The study is designed to minimize the risk of 
harm to all participants participating by [CONTACT_550971].  
Potential Study Benefits  
Participants in this study may benefit directly from having a social media summary dashboard in their 
therapy sessions; in particular it may uncover interesting trends and correlations that could improve 
patient -provider communication and their engagement in treatment. It could also provide additional 
knowledge about how they communicate and use social media platforms, these summaries may be 
revealing and aid healthy behavior change and/or self -management. In addi tion feedback on the 
dashboard will help us better tailor future iterations to better meet the needs of our sample, both the 
patient and provider.  
Alternatives to Participation  
Considering the context of this study, there are no alternative to participatio n available to the 
participants outside of the research context.  
Data and Safety Monitoring  
As noted above, the research team will immediately contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_550957] [ENCRYPT] in the subject, high priority note,  and a read receipt. Once the PI [INVESTIGATOR_550958], they will determine if the participant should continue in the study. 
Please see SAFETY CONCERN Email / Telephone Script and the W2H safety features attached in the 
submission. The safe ty concern protocol, it consists of two emails contact[CONTACT_550972]. If we do not receive a response, we will report our 
concern to clinic director immediately. Additionally, all researc h staff will consult the National Institute 
of Mental Health (NIMH) toolkit for suicide safety assessment. Any participant who requires a level of 
care exceeding customary outpatient services (i.e., psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_550955] a partial

 14 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274567]), or who otherwise report or manifest thoughts or behaviors suggesting possible safety 
concern due to participation in the study, will be removed from the study. In addition to the safety 
monitoring that takes place as part of standard ca re, study staff will provide clinicians with notifications 
about patients of potential concern through a daily email. This email will be sent through the secure 
Penn Medicine email system. This email will be sent each morning (Monday - Friday). Patients wi ll be 
told that the notification system is active only during the business week and expectations for emergency 
situations will be clearly set.

Original  Statistical Analysis Plan  – Sent to IRB  
Stata, SAS, and NVivo software will be used for analyses. All data will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (mean or median, standard deviation, or interquartile range for continuous variables, 
frequencies for categorical variables) and graphical techniques (histograms, scatterplot) as appropriate. 
Standard summary descriptive statistics to be used to analyze data from t he survey. We will extract data 
from social media and wearable device platforms and aggregate to develop dashboards. Qualitative 
analysis using grounded theory will be applied for the focus group discussion, interviews, and open -
ended survey questions. We will conduct an intent to treat (ITT) analysis. The ITT analysis will include all 
randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of their adherence 
with the entry criteria, regardless of the treatment they actually recei ved, and regardless of subsequent 
withdrawal from treatment or deviation from the protocol. Baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics will be reported as frequency and percent for categorical variables and median and 
interquartile range (IQR) for c ontinuous variables. We will compare baseline characteristics between 
intervention and control arms using t -tests for continuous variables and chi -squared tests for categorical 
variables. The goal of these comparisons will be to determine if the two arms a re balanced on baseline 
variables after randomization. For the primary analysis, we will use linear mixed effects models to assess 
whether average of SF [ADDRESS_723894] (as participants will 
be randomized within therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]), by [CONTACT_550973] t he nesting of 
patients within therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. The primary parameter of interest will be a binary indicator for treatment 
arm assignment. Models will also include a variable for time of measurement. Baseline covariates that 
are found to be unbalanced between ar ms may be adjusted for in the model if they were deemed to be 
potential confounders a priori to adjust for potential confounding and for efficiency gain. We will use all 
available SF [ADDRESS_723895] to missing outcome measures as long as 
the missingness mechanism is missing at random (MAR). Patterns of missingness will be assessed 
carefully and multiple imputation will be used if deemed appropriate. Robust (empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477]) standard errors 
will be used. A p  ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_723896] of intervention by [CONTACT_094] -specified sub - 
groups. We will use a similar approach to evaluate secondary outcomes; however, depending on the 
distributional form of the secondary outcome, we will use a generalized mixed effects model with the 
appropriate functional forms for the distribution family and link function.

compare mean changes on our primary outcom es from baseline to [ADDRESS_723898] and would not change our conclusions. In addition,  we 
conducted a complete case analysis as our primary analysis. After assessing patterns of missingness and 
determining that missing at random is a plausible mechanism in this study, we conducted multiple 
imputation. Again, our imputed results were nearly identical to the complete case analysis with identical 
conclusions.

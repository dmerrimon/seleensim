5 PROTOCOL  SYNOPOSIS:  
 
CONCEPT/RATIONALE:  
Sudden cardiac  death  accounts  for more  than 326,000 deaths  per year in the US alone,  and a 
significant  portion of these are attributable  to ventricular  arrhythmia subsequent  to ischemic  (ICM)  
or non-ischemic  cardiomyopathy  (NICM) . Even  with current  gold-standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  a large  
number  of patients  have uncontrolled arrhythmia leading  to either  death or poor quality  of life due 
to recurrent  implantable cardioverter  defibrillator  (ICD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ) shock  rescue.   
 
Stereotactic  ablative radiotherapy  (SABR)  is routinely  used in radiation oncology  to accurately  
ablate small moving  targets  in single  session treatments  with minimal toxicity.  There  is preliminary  
data in both animal  studies  and clinical case  reports  of control  of VT in otherwise refractory  
patients  following  a 30-min single  session  stereotactic  ablative radiotherapy.   
 This protocol  will offer compassionate  use/palliative  therapy  for patients  that have failed  all other  
available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   During  this initial study,  data will be gather ed on efficacy and toxicity  to guide  
future  multi- institutional  studies.  This is a highly  collaborative effort  between radiation  oncology,  
radiology  and cardiology /cardiac  electrophysiology . If successful,  this non-invasive  approach to 
treat ventricular  arrhythmias has the potential  to significantly  impact  the quality  of life and mortality  
risk of a large  group of patients  who at this time have  few viable  treatment  options.

radiotherapy  of targets  in the cardiac  myocardium  
(2) Phase IIa portion:  To make a preliminary  assessment  of the efficacy  of stereotactic  
ablative radiotherapy  technique for the control  of ventricular  arrhythmia  
 SECONDARY  OBJECTIVE  (S):  
(1) To determine impact  on overall  cardiac  function (ejection  fraction)  
(2) To determine impact  on quality  of life

STUDY  DESIGN:  
Single  arm, phase Ib/2a  dose escalation study  with an expansion cohort  to determine the maximal  
tolerated dose  (MTD)  for stereotactic  ablative radiotherapy  of targets  in the cardiac  myocardium  
and to make  a preliminary  assessment  of the efficacy  of the treatment.  The dose escalation will 
be guided by [CONTACT_91241] -to-Event  Continual  Reassessment  Method (TITE -CRM)  to ensure more  
patients  will be spared dose  limiting  toxicities  and more  patients  will be entered on the dose  level 
that will be chosen as minimal dose  of maximal  effect.  This design  also allows  for continual  accrual  
of patients  when delayed  adverse events  may be observed.

7 STATISTICAL  METHODS:  
 
SAMPLE  SIZE JUSTIFICATION:  
Phase Ib portion:  Dose  escalation will be based on Time -to-Event  Continual  Reassessment  
Method (TITE -CRM).  A sample size of 22 patients  will be used.  Monte Carlo  simulations  show  
that the proposed  sample  size has acceptable probability  of correctly  selecting a dose  with 
acceptable toxicit y and enough patients  treated about  the target  dose for characterization of the 
efficacy  endpoints,  while  being  feasible for completion within  25 months.  
 Phase IIa portion:  Approximately  8 additional  patients  will be enrolled at the MTD .  Based on the 
simulation results  for Phase  1b, a total of 16-20 patients  (8-12 patients  in the dose escalation  
cohort  and 8 in the expansion cohort)  will be used to assess  efficacy . Literatures  suggest  6-month  
ICD shock  free survival  rate is about  50%.  Assuming  the proposed  SABR  treatment  will yield 6-
month ICD shock  free survival  rate of 80%,  a sample  size of 16 patients  achieves  80% power  to 
detect  a 30% difference in 6-month  ICD shock  free survival,  using  a one-sided one-sample  exact  
Binomial  test, at a 0.10 significance level.

2.0 BACKGROUND 
Sudden cardiac  death  (SCD)  is a significant  public  health hazard,  accounting for more  than 
326,000 deaths  per year in the US alone [1]. This is a larger  toll than deaths  from lung,  colon,  
breast  and prostate  cancers  combined.  In part, this bleak  statistic  is due to resuscitation being  
successful  in only some 10% of cases [2]. Even  the routine use of implantable cardioverter -
defibrillators  (ICDs)  to rescue patients  from these  arrhythmias  in the context  of either  primary  or 
secondary  prevention have  been less than ideal , as elderly  patients  may actually  exhibit  
increased mortality  even when these devices  function appropriately [3]. Thus,  attention  has been 
focused mainly  on preventing the malignant  arrhythmias  that contribute  to SCD.  Estimates  vary,  
but some  22% of SCD patient  initially  present  with VT, and in select  populations,  up to 83% of 
SCDs  can be attributed  to ventricular  arrhythmia  [4, 5]. In the majority  of cases,  the life-
threatening arrhythmias  arise  from slowly  conducting scar related circuits  that result  from 
devitalized cardiac  tissues following  a myocardial  infarction  or other  insult . Conventional  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_146735] a have significant  drawbacks  with respect  to impact  on quality  
of life, invasiveness,  and efficacy.  For example,  gold standard  front-line therapy  for those  who 
fail anti-arrhythmic  drug therapy  consists  of endocardial  catheter  ablation.  However,  in large  
multi-center  trials  the efficacy  of catheter  base d ablation is around  50% at 12 months  [6, 7]. In 
part, this is explained by [CONTACT_146757][INVESTIGATOR_146736],  including complex  arrhythmia s with multiple  
potential  reentry  circuits,  unstable VTs due to hemodynamic  intolerance,  and reentry  paths  deep  
to the endocardium  which  limit the efficacy  of ablation.  When  endocardial  ablation fails, pre-
existing  limited  cardiovascular  fitness  of these  patients  and procedural  expertise limited  to 
relative ly few specialized  centers  make the more  complex  subxiphoid percutaneous  epi[INVESTIGATOR_146737] a minority  of patients.   
 
Should these procedures  fail to control  recurrent  VT’s,  salvage procedures  are available but 
again with significant  limitations.  For example,  cardiac  transplantation  has traditionally  been the 
salvage therapy  of choice.  However,  the both the functional  demands  this treatment  places  on 
patients  and the limited  number  of available donor  organs  have made  this a relatively  
uncommon salvage  treatment.  More  recently,  surgical  resection  of the bilateral stellate  ganglion  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_146738],  with control  of some 50% of patients  
refractory  to medical  and ablation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  [8, 9]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_146739],  the technical  demands  of 
this technique  have limited  its applications  to a few number  of academic  centers,  and has thus 
limited  its impact  to-date. Given  the prevalence of VT in patients  with structural  heart  disease  
and the modest  at best success of current  interventional  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , a large  number  of patients

of life, and in some  populations’  length of life [3]. 
 
Within  the field of radiation oncology,  there  is a large  body  of experience and techniques  for 
very accurate delivery  of radiation to very small targets  – stereotactic  ablative radiotherapy  
(SABR) . Within  the cranium,  for example,  targets  that are millimeters  in diameter  are verifiably  
treated with high doses  of radiation with sub-millimeter  accuracy.  This has been routine  practice 
now for many  decades.  Outside  of the cranium,  the periodic  motions  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_146740].  Even  then,  motion  management  
systems developed recently  are able to reduce the error  of delivery  of high dose radiation 
delivery  to below  5-millimeters.  These  consist  of either  fixed  abdominal  compression  to 
minimize  diaphragm  travel,  or algorithms  to track  and predict  target  location  based on the 
periodicity  of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_146741].  Both these  techniques  are now in routine clinical use to allow  
extra -cranial  stereotactic  ablative radiotherapy  (SABR).  Within  the chest,  this is most  commonly  
directed against  early  stage lung malignancies  as well as oligometastatic  lesions.  Ablation of 
targets  with SABR  techniques  have the advantage that targets are treated  under  direct  
visualization,  the treatment  is non-invasive,  can be completed in a single  session,  and patients  
return  home  immediately  after. The ability  to non-invasively  and accurately  ablate small  targets  
within  the body  offers  a multitu de of therapeutic  opportunities  outside  of oncology.  This project  
will pi[INVESTIGATOR_146742]-arrhythmi c indications.  
 
Early  large  animal  studies  have shown that a sufficiently  high dose  of radiation can be delivered 
safely  to a targeted area of the ventricular  myocardium,  and that this treatment  causes  a 
homogenous  scarring that suppresses  local action potentials  [10-12]. Long -term clinical and 
histopathological  follow -up in these  animal  studies  showed no significant  toxicity  outside the 
target  region.  In humans,  there  is a significant  experience of the left ventricle receiving  these 
high radiation doses  incidentally,  in the form inevitable dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_146743]  [13]. Regions  of the heart  exposed to a single  dose  of 
radiation >20 Gy begin  to show  metabolic  changes  on follow  up PET scans  at 6 months,  but this 
does  not correlate  with any compromise  of the cardi ac function[14] . Indee d, the toxicity  profile  of 
SABR  specifically  directed against  post-MI and non-ischemic  lesions  that are most  likely  
substrates  for slow conduction and VT is likely  to be even superior  to this, as these  sections  of 
the myocardium  are already  scarred  from previous  insult . With regard  to efficacy,  there  are thus 
far only two independent  case  reports  of first-in-man studies  using the existing  clinical linear  
accelerators  systems  on a compassionate use basis  showing  decreased VTs after targeted  
radiotherapy,  and absence of treatment  associated toxicity  [15, 16]. In contrast  animal  studies,  
where electrophysiologic  changes  were  seen  months  later,  control  of VTs in these two patients  
were  noted starting some  48hrs  from completion of treatment  [15, 16].

diagnostic  cardiac  MRI for radiation therapy  planning,  (2) CT-simulation,  (3) routine cardiac  panel  
blood samples  (if not done within  the previous  14 days)  and research  blood samples  (50 ml), (4)

5.0 TREATMENT  PLAN  
5.1 Radiation  Simulation  and Planning  
Enrolled patient s, after confirmation  of eligibility , will undergo radiation simulation and treatment  
planning.  A thoracic  alpha cradle  will be used.  This will be fused  with diagnostic  cardiac  MRI with 
delayed enhancement  sequences  to identify  the regions  of scar potentially  contributing to the 
clinical VT. This will also be fused  with electro -anatomical  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_146744]  
3-D mappi[INVESTIGATOR_146745].  
 
The responsible study  investigator(s),  will delineate the regions  of delayed enhancement  visible  
on MRI as gross  tumor  volume (GTV).  Areas  outside the MRI scar identified by [CONTACT_146758].  
No expansion for clinical treatment  volume will be used.  Without  respi[INVESTIGATOR_146746],  an internal  
target  volume (ITV) expansion will be used.  Planni ng target  volume  (PTV)  expansion will consist  
of 6mm  superior -inferior,  with 6mm  circumferential.  Dose  will be prescribed to the 70-80% isodose  
line to meet  tolerance.   PTV prescription dose  will begin at 15Gy  x 1, and increase in stepwise [ADDRESS_167888] will optimize  the radiation therapy  treatment  plan and the responsible study  
investigator(s)  will review  it prior to approval  for treatment.  Dose  volume  histograms  (DVH),  and 
normal  tissue  constraint  parameters  specified  below  will be used  to judge the quality  of the plan 
and optimize  doses  to the GTV/PTV  as well as maximally  sparing  of organs  at risk (OARs).  The 
dose and volume of the heart  will be recorded.  
 
Treatment  will be delivered in a single  session  treatment  lasting  30-[ADDRESS_167889] prior to patient  
arrival.  
 
5.2 Objects at Risk  (OAR)  Dose Constraints  
The dose  constraints  below  for OARs  will be used  to assess  the dosimetry  for the plan.  Doses  
that exceed the constraints  below  can be delivered if study  investigators  agree that the deviation  
is acceptable and unlikely  to cause  excessive  morbidity.

after the end of radiation therapy.  Appropriate skin care and topi[INVESTIGATOR_146748].  It is expected  to be self-limiting,  and improve  1 
week  after the end of therapy.  
 
7.1.5  Radiation pericarditis  and fibrosis  
Radiation therapy  close  to the pericardium  may cause inflammation  of the lining  of the heart,  and 
radiation- induced pericarditis.  Fluid -accumulation in the pericardium  may be a consequence.  
Symptoms  can be similar  to radiation pneumonitis:  shortness  of breath,  fever,  and dry cough.  
Signs  on CT scan  and clinical exam  are keys to its expedient  diagnosis.  Since  this toxicity  occurs  
generally  after radiation therapy  between [ADDRESS_167897]  of radiation therapy  to the thorax.  Its 
severity  may or may not correlate with symptoms  relating  to pneumonitis,  which  occurs  faster  
than radiation- induced  lung fibrosis.  Radiation pulmonary  fibrosis can occur  3 months  to 1 year 
after radiation therapy.  Treatments  include exercise,  medications  used  for patients  with COPD,  
and oxygen.   
 
7.1.7  Fistula  formation  
Radiation fistula  formation between the trachea/bronchus  and esophagus  is a potential  late-side 
effect  of radiation  therapy  to the thorax.  It is primarily  due to injury  of these hollow  structures  that 
is unable to be repaired  by [CONTACT_146759].  It is a rare complication  in the 
modern  era of therapeutic  radiation  therapy.  Gener al time course  for radiation- induced fistula  
formation is 6 months  to 2 years  after treatment.  Main  treatment  option is surgical  intervention  
and repair.

10. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Study  Design and Objectives 
 This is a single  arm, phase  Ib/2a  dose  escalation study  with an expansion cohort  with the primary  
objectives  of determining  the maximal  tolerated dose  (MTD)  for stereotactic  ablative radiotherapy  
of targets  in the cardiac  myocardium  and assessing  the preliminary  efficacy  of the treatment  for 
the control  of ventricular  arrhythmia.  The secondary  objectives  are to determine  the treatme nt 
impact  on overall  cardiac  function (ejection  fraction) , on quality  of life, on overall  survival  and to 
assess treatment -related  toxicity  by [CONTACT_146754],  imaging,  and histology . 
 The dose escalation will be guided by [CONTACT_91241] -to-Event  Continual  Reassessment  Method (TITE -
CRM)  [17] to ensure more  patients  will be spared dose limiting  toxicities  and more  patients  will be 
entered on the dose  level that will be chosen as minimal  dose of maximal  effect. This design also 
allows  for continual  accrual  of patients  when delayed adverse events  may be observed.  
 
10.2 Sample Size and Power  Considerations  
 
10.2.1. Phase Ib dose -escalation portion:  
A dose escalation design based on TITE -CRM  will be used for this phase. A sample size of 22 
patients will be used. We will investigate five different dose levels (15Gy x 1, 20Gy x 1, 25Gy x 
1, 30Gy x 1, 35Gy x 1). The main advantage of TITE -CRM is that one can update the best 
guess regarding the op timal dose by [CONTACT_146760]. This 
method also incorporates the time to toxicity for each patient to avoid prolonged trial suspension 
while patients are being observed for late -onset tox icities.   
We will start at a low initial dose 15Gy to ensure a maximum number of patients treated in a 
wide range of the dose -probability curve. We will only allow one- step escalation at a time and 
one patient at each step.  Specifically, suppose that our targeted MTD of SABR is the dose l evel 
associated with a 20% probability of dose -limiting toxicity (DLT). Each of the five dose levels will 
Amendment  2                                                                                                                              Version  21June2018 
18 be assigned with prior guesses of DLT probabilities (0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20, 
respectively) according to the investigator’s experience and results from previous studies  [13, 
15, 16] . A one -parameter logistic model with fixed scale parameter equals to [ADDRESS_167899] dose (15Gy X 1), t he posterior DLT probability of each dose level based on the logistic 
model will be re- estimated after each new patient  inclusion. We will choose the dose level with 
the updated posterior success probability closest to our target DLT rate (20%) to administrate to 
the next patient. The  process will continue until the exhaustion of the proposed sample size, and 
the dose with the posterior DLT  probability closest to 20% will be  selected as the MTD. 
Meanwhile, we will closely monitor adverse events and other safety endpoints.  
Monte Carlo s imulation s were used to assess the operating characteristi cs of this design. 1000 
trials were simulated using 3 different assumptions about the true probabilities of DLT  at each 
dose: A) same as the prior probabilities; B ) somewhat more toxic than the prior probabilities; C ) 
more toxic than the prior probabilities with significant increase in toxicity between doses 30Gy 
and 35Gy. Among the operating characteristics considered in the sample size were the 
expected number of DLTs , the probability of selecting the correct dose (that associated with a 
20% probability of DLT) as the target dose at the end of the trial, the time required to complete 
the trial, and the number of patients treated at or near the target dose. Sample s izes from [ADDRESS_167900] acceptable probability of correctly selecting a dose with acceptable toxicity and enough patients treated about the target do se for characterization of the efficacy endpoints, 
while being feasible for completion within 25 months.  The simulation results based on n=22 
patients are shown in Table 1:

Note: The dose -toxicity curve is assumed to follow a logistic model as stated in the table.  The true 
probabilities of DLT  vary in three different scenarios, while the prior probabilities are the same.  The 
target probability for DLT is 0.2. For each scenario, [ADDRESS_167901] dose and only allows one dosage escalation at a time.  
The design assumes an accrual rate of one patient per month and a 3 -month observed window for DLT.  
The study durat ion is estimated to be 25 months.  
 
10.2.2. Phase IIa expansion portion:  
The primary objective of the expansion phase is to assess the preliminary efficacy of the 
treatment by [CONTACT_146761] 6 months.  Approximately 8 
additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD. Based on the simulation results in Table 1, a 
total of 16 -20 patients ( 8-12 patients  in the dose escalation cohort and 8  in the expansion 
cohort) will be used to further assess toxicity, ICD shock free surv ival rate, overall survival , 
quality of life and overall cardiac function.  Literature suggest  6-month ICD shock free survival 
rate is about 50 %[6, 8, 9] . Assuming the proposed SABR treatment will yield 6- month ICD shock 
free survival rate of 80%, a sample size of 16 patients achieves 80 % power to detect a 30% 
difference in [ADDRESS_167902], at a 0.10  significance level.

10.3.1   Analysis  of Primary  Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis  of Dose -Limiting  Toxicities  
The primary  endpoint  in Phase Ib portion is to either  reach the MTD  or a total dose of 35Gy.  
Toxicity  will be graded  using  the NCI Common  Toxicity  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  v. 
4.0. A dose -limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  is any treatment -related  grade  3, 4, or 5 toxicities  in the 
following  categories:  gastrointestinal,  cardiovascular,  pulmonary,  neurologic,  or constitutional  
symptoms  OR any other  grade 4 or 5 toxicity  attributed to the therapy.  All reported DLTs  will be

that a DLT has occurred.  The study  will close  when  either  of the following  events  occurs:  1) the 
MTD  is reached,  or 2) the highest  protocol  dose  level is treated  and tolerated (a prescribed  dose 
of 35Gy)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis  of Preliminary  Efficacy  
 The primary  endpoint  in Phase IIa portion is ICD shock  free survival  rate at 6 month s.  For patients  
treated at MTD , we will calculate the ICD shock  free rate and the corresponding  95% confidence  
interval .  
 
10.3.2   Analysis  of Secondary  Endpoints  
1) Incidence  of salvage  definitive  anti-arrhythmia  therapy  (cardiac  transplant)  will be 
calculated and tabulated ; 
2) Incidence  of return  of ventricular  tachycardia requiring defibrillation,  intravenous  drug 
therapy  or readmission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146750];  
3) Incidence of ICD shocks  in the periods  of 3,[ADDRESS_167903] the SABR  
procedure  will be calculated and tabulated;  
4) Incidence of decline  of LV ejection fraction by [CONTACT_56944] 5% on two cons ecutive  
echocardiograms  will be calculated and tabulated;  
5) Incidence of persistent  increase in baseline supplemental  oxygen  requirement  by 1L 
for a duration of >3 months  will be calculated and tabulated;  
6) Incidence of Use of steroids  for radiotherapy  related indications  
7) Overall  survival  will be estimated  by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier  method . Summaries  of the number  
and percentage of patients  who have died,  are still in survival  follow -up, are lost to 
follow -up and have withdrawn  consent  will be provided along  with median overall  
survival.  
8) The score  of quality  of life questionnaire will be summarized  at each time point  and 
comparison  of pre- and post-treatment  scores  will be carried  out by [CONTACT_105]-parametric  
Wilcoxon sign-rank test. 
10.3.3  Safety  Analysis  
Overall  exposure to study  agen t, the numbers  of patients  completing  the study,  and the dose 
intensity  will be summarized  using  descriptive statistics.  Serum  markers,  imaging,  and histology  
will be assessed  throughout  the study  period for toxicity.  AEs and SAEs  will be reported  using  a 
CTCAE  v4.0 terminology  and severity.  
 
10.4 Interim  Analysis  
Interim  reports  will be prepared every  six months  until the results  of the study  are published.  In 
general,  the interim  reports  will contain information  about  patient  accrual  rate with projected  
completion dates,  status  of QA review  and compliance rate of treatment  per protocol,  and the 
frequencies  and severity  of toxicity.

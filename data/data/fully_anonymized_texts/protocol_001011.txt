Study Design:  
This is a phase I study that will evaluate imaging characteristics of 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_249936] Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image s/data, 
including volumetric, functional and standard clinical sequences, and cognitive /behavioral data as 
part of the PFBHS made available to this study to allow for analysis and comparison. Screening 
assessments may take place over several days , within 90 days of the 18F-AV-1451 Positron Emission 
Tomography ( PET) scan, and will include demographic information, cognitive testing and safety 
assessments. Subjects may be permitted to return for the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan after the 90 day 
window with sponsor approval if the investigator does not recognize any significant medical changes. If a volumetric MRI has not been performed as part of PFBHS within six months  of the 
18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging visit, a volumetric MRI is to  be performed as part of this study’s screening assessments.  
 Subjects who qualify for the study will return to the clinic at a later date for the 
18F-AV-1451 PET 
imaging visit. For the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging visit, an intravenous catheter will be placed for IV 
administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection.  Subjects will receive a single IV bolus injection with a  
target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 Injection followed by a saline flush. At 
approximately 75 minutes following injection, a continuous 30-minute brain scan will begin. Adverse 
events will be monitored continuously during the imaging session . A physician  or a 
licensed/credentialed medical professional (i.e., a PET technologist, imaging center nurse or a regional equivalent) designated by [CONTACT_16541] [INVESTIGATOR_209103] . If a designee performs this activity, 
a physician must be available to provide medical consultation.  
All professional fighters > 50 years of age and other participants in whom, and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the clinical presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  will 
return to the clinic for a florbetapir F [ADDRESS_249937] be 
performed no more than 60 days apart. For the florbetapir F 18 PET imaging visit, an intravenous catheter will be placed for IV administration of Florbetapir F 18 Injection. Subjects will receive a single IV bolus injection target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of Florbetapir F [ADDRESS_249938] information about any new adverse events.  If both of these days are not 
business days, the follow -up phone call can occur the following business day.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern with 1.7 million people 
in the [LOCATION_002] suffering a TBI each year  (Faul et al., 2010) .  There is longstanding 
evidence linking a history of TBI to increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  
(Graves  et al., 1990) , and emerging concern that a single TBI could initiate long- term 
processes leading to dementia that is independent of AD  (Johnson et  al., 
2010) .  Pathologically, a myloid -beta (Aβ)  deposits have been identified  following a 
single TBI in approximately 30% of patients ( Huber  et al., 1993; Ikonomovic et  al., 
2004).   Plaques found acutely following TBI are typi[INVESTIGATOR_209104] , in contrast to the 
thioflavine-S-positive neuritic plaques characteristic of AD.  Thus far, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) have not been identified following a single TBI in humans; although the  
neuropathologica l evidence is sparse, with the  only study examining this issue limited 
to patients dying within 4  weeks of injury  (Smith  et al., 2003) . 
 Emerging research suggests that tau pathology similar to that seen in Alzheimer’s disease may be more likely after even  a single TBI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (Johnson et. al, 2012). 
Chronic repetitive TBI has been linked to the pathological entity known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy  (CTE).  CTE is a clinic -pathological entity  characterized  
post mortem  by [CONTACT_209115], 
often mild or concussive, head injury such as boxers ( Corsellis  et al., 1973;   Dale et al. 
1991; Geddes  et al., 1999) and  professional football players ( McKee et  al., 2009; 
McKee et al., 2013) . 
 The Professional Fighters Brain Health Study (PFBHS) being conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health  is a longitudinal study that focuses 
on a sample of active and retired professional fighters , and compares them with a 
control cohort matched for age and level of education. The primary objective of the PFBHS is to determine the relationship between measures of head trauma exposure and 
other potential modifiers and changes in brain imaging, neurological and behavioral 
function over t ime (Bernick, 2013).  In this context, the addition of an imaging 
biomarker that could identify the presence of underlying tau pathology might be useful in understanding the etiology and evolution of CTE, and could potentially identify cases at risk for su bsequent neurodegeneration or other clinically important outcomes 
with implications for management of CTE and/or TBI cases.      
18F-AV-1451 (originally named [F -18]T807 by [CONTACT_209116]) has been developed as a positron emitting 
radiopharmaceutical for in vivo  imaging of tau protein aggregates (Xia et al., 2013).  
Autoradiography results  using tissue sections from human brains showed a strong 
signal in the grey matter of cortical slices fr om tau positive brains, but weak or no 
binding in tau negative , Aβ positive, or tau and A β negative tissue.   Scatchard analysis  
based on this heterogeneous autoradiography assay yielded an estimated K d of 15nM. 
A saturation binding experiment using purified PHF tau  isolated from brains of AD 
patients  yielded a K d value of 0.54 nM.

common central nervous system ( CNS ) targets  and no clinically relevant inhibition was 
seen.   AV-1451 was positive in the i n vitro hERG assay; however, in vivo  
cardiovascular safety pharmacology assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT 
prolongation at doses up to 50x the intended maximum human dose (MHD).  Nonetheless, until sufficient human c ardiovascular safety data are available, initial 
clinical studies will exclude subjects with a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes and subjects taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. 
In vivo  safety pharmacology studies were also conduct ed in rats to determine potential 
effects on the CNS and respi[INVESTIGATOR_27441]. In these studies no clinically relevant 
effects were reported at doses exceeding 100x the intended MHD. Additionally, non-radioactive AV -[ADDRESS_249948] levels (NOAELs) were the highest doses tested (150x MHD for single, 50x MHD for repeat).  
 
Potential genotoxicity of non- radioactive AV -1451 was tested in both in vitro and in 
vivo assays.  In the in vitro  assays, AV -1451 tested positive for potential genotoxicity.   
However, in the in vivo  rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 750x MHD (scaled 
allometrically), AV -[ADDRESS_249949] systems. In vivo , AV -1451 is cleared rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]; however, the in vitro  experiments 
employ static, prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of the test article. 
While the in vitro  data show the potential for genotoxicity, the in vivo  data provide 
assurance that genotoxicity is unlikely to occur at clinically -relevant doses for human 
diagnostic studies. 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects.  Generally, the radiotracer 
distribution was consistent among the subjects and showed rapid hepatobiliary clearance.  There were three organs that received estimated doses higher than 0.05 mSv/MBq. The organ that received the largest estimated dose was the upper large intestinal wall (0. 0962 ± 0.0134 mSv/MBq), followed by [CONTACT_209117].  The Effective Dose was 0. 0241 ± 0.0016 mSv/MBq. This results in an estimated 
Effective Dose of 8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is 
comparable to the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and florbetapir F 18 injection.  
18F-AV-1451 may be useful as a marker of tau pathology in patients with AD and other 
neurodegenerative disor ders (Figure s 1 and 2).  Several preliminary studies 
using 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_249950] been completed (e.g., Chien et al., 2013). Based on this 
rationale, the goal of this protocol is to perform 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging on active 
and retired professional fighters enrolled in the PFBHS protocol and explore  its 
potential as a biomarker for brain injury related to repetitive head trauma.

 Subjects who qualify for the study will return to the clinic at a later date for 
the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging visit. For the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging visit, an 
intravenous catheter will be placed for IV administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection.  
Subjects will receive a single IV bolus injection  with a  target dose of 370 MBq (10 
mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 Injection followed by a saline flush. At approximately 75 
minutes following injection, a continuous 30-minute brain scan will begin.  Adverse 
events will be monitored continuously during the imaging session . A physician  or a 
licensed/credentialed medical professional (i.e. a PET technologist, imaging center nurse or a regional equivalent) designated by [CONTACT_16541] [INVESTIGATOR_209106] . If a designee performs this activity, a physician must be available 
to provide medical consultation.  
All professional fighters > [ADDRESS_249959] be performed no more than 60 days apart. For the florbetapir F 18 PET imaging visit, an intravenous catheter will be plac ed for IV 
administration of Florbetapir F 18 Injection. Subjects will receive a single IV bolus injection target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of Florbetapir F [ADDRESS_249960] information about 
any new adver se events.  If both of these days are not business days, the follow-up 
phone call can occur the following business day. 
   
Analyses will explore the relationship among 18F-AV-1451 uptake measurements, 
florbetapir SUVR (where applicable),  cognitive  and neuropsychiatric 
measurements, and other collected biomarkers in  subjects , and will explore if 
the 18F-AV-1451 uptake measurements are different across patient enrollment 
groups. 
 
5.2 Planned Dosage and Duration of Treatment 
 5.2.1 Dosage and Administration  
 
18F-AV-1451:  
 
All subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration of approximately 370 
MBq (10 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 Injection.

 Florbetapir F 18: 
 
Subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration of approximately 370 
MBq (10 mCi) of Florbetapir F 18 Injection.   
 5.2.2 Rationale for Dosage  
 
18F-AV-1451 will be administered IV in a radioactive dose of 370 MBq (10 
mCi) with a maximum human dose (MHD) limited to 20 µg of compound by 
[CONTACT_8497].  This dose is 150 fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat single dose toxicity study and is 50 fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies.  Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. The results estimated an Effective Dose of 8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and 
is comparable to the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as 
FDG and florbetapir F [ADDRESS_249961] meet all of the following criteria to enroll in this trial:  
 1. Males that have consented, are c urrently enrolled in  the PFBHS  protocol, 
and have participated in a minimum of 10 professional fights; 
2. Can tolerate PET s can procedures;  and 
3. Have the ability to provide informed consent for study procedures (i f the 
patient is ineligible to give informed consent, based on local standards, the patient’s legal representative may consent on behalf of the patient, but the patient must still confirm assent).  
 Subjects with cognitive impairment should meet the following crit eria: 
 1. Have subjective cognitive complaints or objective decline or impa irment as 
determined by [CONTACT_093].

QTcF>450 msec. Subjects with QTcF>450 msec in the presence of bundle 
branch block may be enrolled after discussion with sponsor ); 
4. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (e.g.,  
heart failure,  hypokalemia, family history of Long QT syndrome)  or are taking 
drugs that are known to cause QT-prolongation (a list of prohibited and 
discouraged medications is provided by [CONTACT_1034]); 
5. Have a current clinically significant infectious disease, endocrine or 
metabolic disease, pulmonary, renal or hepatic i mpairment, or cancer that the 
investigator believes would affect study participation or scan results; 6. Have had a non- study related radiopharmaceutical imaging or treatment 
procedure within 7 days prior to the 
18F-AV-1451 imaging session;  
7. Have current  drug or alcohol dependence or alcohol dependence within the 
past 2 years ; and

Page [ADDRESS_249972] (IRB).  No study related procedures shall be performed prior to completion of the informed consent process, and signing of the consent form.  A copy of the signed informed consent should be given to the patient for their records.   
7.6 Documentation 
 
18F-AV-1451 and florbetapir F 18 PET scans will be saved in an appropriate 
electronic format as specified in the imaging manual s.  A copy of all scans, 
including the MRI scans conducted per PFBH  study protocol, will be saved at the 
site/imaging center and a copy of each will be forwarded to the sponsor described 
in the imaging manual s.  All other data required by [CONTACT_209120] .  All data in the eCRF s will be substantiated by “source documents,” 
which consist of the subject’s medical files, laboratory result sheets, ECG tracings, etc.  All source documentation must be available to Avid , and its designees.  
Completed source documents and e CRFs may need to be made available and 
complete for an audit by [CONTACT_1622], other international regulatory authorities , or 
Avid at any time.  The eCRFs and all other records must be filed in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations (see Section 10.6). 
 
7.7 Adverse Events (AE)  
 
Avid’s standards for recording and reporting adverse events (AEs) are to be 
followed regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  All AEs must be fully recorded on the a dverse event e CRF s. 
Investigators will be instructed to report to Avid , or its designee , their assessment 
of the potential relatedness of each AE to study drug or protocol procedure via 
electronic data entry.  If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, 
Protocol  18F-AV-1451- A11:  “18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging in Professional Fighters”    
 
Page [ADDRESS_249973] clearly report to  Avid , or its designee , via electronic data 
entry the circumstances and data leading to any such discontinuation of treatment. 
In cases where the investigator notices an unanticipated benefit to the patient, study site personnel should report “unexpected benefit” with the actual event term to Avid , or its designee (for example, the complete actual term would be “unexpected 
benefit - sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_176073]”).  
 Laboratory test abnormalities considered by [CONTACT_209121] e vent eCRF s.  Signs and symptoms of 
each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates/time, severity/intensity, relatio nship to study drug , action taken, and event resolution ).  
Additionally, any clinically significant findings from laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements, or other study procedures  including those that result in a 
diagnosis should be reported as an AE to Avid , or its designee .

7.7.[ADDRESS_249975] during a 
clinical trial, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
 For reporting purposes, Avid will distinguish among pre-existing conditions, trial- emergent adverse events and treatment -emergent adverse events.   
 Pre-existing conditions (i.e., undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that 
begin prior to the Screening Visit) will be recorded on the medical history eCRF  pages. During the study, site personnel will record any change in the 
condition(s) and occurrence and nature of any AEs.  Signs and symptoms that are believed to be due to the pre- existing condition (s) (started prior to dose of 
study medication) do not have to be recorded in the AEs section of the eCRF, unless there is an increas e in frequency and severity. 
 Trial -emergent adverse events are undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms 
that begin, or worsen in intensity or frequency, after the informed conse nt, and 
prior to administration of the study drug at the imaging visit. Adverse events 
that occur between the florbetapir F 18 and the 
18F-AV-1451 PET scans outside 
the 48 hour windows will also be considered trial- emergent adverse events. 
These will be re corded on the adverse event eCRFs.

Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
 
A SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of the following events: 
• Death;  
• Initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (other than that required by 
[CONTACT_990]; “social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” or any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33566]- medical 
reasons does not constitute a SAE); 
• A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying);  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Considered significant by [CONTACT_81121]. 
                                          
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122949], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
  
Unexpected Adverse Event 
 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously reported or an adverse event that occurs with specificity, severity or frequency that is not consistent with the current IB.

 Relationship to Study Drug 
 
Investigators will be instructed to report their assessment of the potential relatedness of each adverse event to protocol procedure or study drug.  The assessment of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF.  
Intensity/Severity of an Adverse Event 
 
In addition to assessing the relationship of the administration of the study drug  
to adverse events, an assessment is required , in order to determine  the intensity 
(severity) of the event.  
 The following classifications should be used:  Mild:   
A mild adverse event is an adverse event, usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities.  
 Moderate :   
A moderate adverse event is an adverse event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities.  
 Severe:   
A severe adverse event is an adverse event that incapacitates the subject and prevents normal activities.   Note that a severe event is not necessarily a serious 
event ; nor must a serious event necessarily be severe.

Protocol  18F-AV-1451- A11:  “18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging in Professional Fighters”    
 
Page [ADDRESS_249978] receives a dose of study drug will be collected until 48 hours after the  dosing of the study drug, regardless of the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289].  Therefore, SAEs that occur later than [ADDRESS_249979] been caused by a protocol procedure.  Previously planned (prior to signing the ICF) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study.  
   
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 8.1 General Statistical Considerations  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 8.2 or higher.  The study data collected under PFBHS  protocol, such as  but not limited to  subjects’ 
demographic and baseline characteristics, history taking, neurological and  
behavioral evaluations, and MRI will be transferred to Avid for analysis purposes.  Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects [N], mean, standard deviation [SD], median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum) for 
continuous variables and using frequency count and percentage for discrete variables.  The demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized for all subjects in the safety p opulation according to clinical group.  Safety data will 
be summarized for all patients.  
 Subject listings of all data from the eCRFs as well as any derived variables will be presented.   Descriptive Statistics will be applied to describe the 
18F-AV-[ADDRESS_249980] enrollment groups (active/ retired 
professional fighters  and cognitive impaired/normal ). ANOVA test, or comparable 
non-parametric test s such as the Kruskall- Wallis test when ANOVA’s 
pre-requisites are not met, will be conducted to detect the differences 
Protocol  18F-AV-1451- A11:  “18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging in Professional Fighters”    
 
Page [ADDRESS_249981] if there are difference s seen 
in 18F-AV-1451 uptake measurements between pair -wised enrollment groups.  
Additional exploratory analyses will be applied to explore the relationship 
among 18F-AV-1451 uptake measurements, cognitive and neurological  
measurements, and  other collected biomarkers in the study subjects. 
 Additional details concerning statistical analyses will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to be completed per Avid SOP . 
 
8.[ADDRESS_249982] (s) and by [CONTACT_209122] (s).  Changes from baseline ( pre-dose time point) values will be determined 
and summarized.    
 Adverse events including injection site reactions will be summarized in terms of number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE.  The summary will be further broken down by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms.   Adver se events 
will also be presented by [CONTACT_926], relationship to treatment and seriousness.  All subjects who experience SAEs , or who discontinue due to AEs, will be 
summarized . 
 
Discontinuation  
 All subjects who discontinued participation prior to completing the study will be listed and their discontinuation reasons will be tabulated.   
Vital Signs  
 
 Changes in vital signs from baseline will be summarized.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_249983] injection will be 
analyzed . Additional details concerning image analyses will be included in a 
separate document to be completed prior to the end of the study.   
Florbetapir F 18 images will be analyzed as previously  published (Clark et al. 2011, 
2012). 
 
9.     USE OF D ATA AND PUBLICATION 
Protocol  18F-AV-1451- A11:  “18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging in Professional Fighters”    
 
Page 31 of 38 
 Avid adheres to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) 
Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communication of Clinical Trial Results.  A complete copy of these principles is available from Avid and can also be found at the PhRMA website  (http://www.phrma.org
).  Avid’s  policy is briefly summarized below:  
 
• We commit to timely communication of meaningful results of controlled clinical 
trials, regardless of outcome.  
• As a sponsor, we may recommend that the Investigator(s) delay or decline 
publication in cases where the study design , conduct, or data are insufficient to 
allow meaningful interpretation.  Avid and the Investigator(s) will discuss the study 
design and data in advance of the study, and again after completion, and will strive, through appropriate scientific debate, to reach a consensus regarding the potential merits of publication.  
• Avid retains the right to review any manuscripts, presentations, or abstracts befor e 
they are submitted for publication. Where differences of opi[INVESTIGATOR_209111], the parties (Avid and the Investigator) should try to resolve them through appropriate scientific debate.  Avid retains the right to delay publication for up to [ADDRESS_249984] intellectual property.  
• Anyone who provides substantial contributions should receive appropriate recognition as an author or contributor when the manuscript is published.  
This is a multi- center study. A multi- center publication, reporting the primary analysis 
data set, should precede any other publications. 
10.    INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
 
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to Good Clinical Practice 
regulat ions; this may include an inspection by [CONTACT_176104]/or Health Authority 
representatives (FDA or international regulatory authorities) at any time.  
10.[ADDRESS_249985] (IRB)   
 
The intent of the research program, the trial protocol, the patient 
informat ion/informed consent form and any advertising material used to recruit 
subjects must be submitted to the clinical investigator’s local IRB and its approval must be obtained prior to its use.  A copy of the approval must be forwarded to Avid.  When necessar y, an extension or renewal of IRB approval must be obtained and 
also forwarded to Avid. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_249986] be obtained from each patient.  A copy of the signed informed consent should be given to the patient for the ir records.  A copy 
of the local IRB’s approved version of the informed consent form must be forwarded to Avid, or its designee, for review prior to being used to obtain patient 
consent.

10.5 Study Drug  Control 
The receipt of clinical supplies ( e.g. starting material for 18F-AV-1451) must be 
documented at the site .   
 All drug supplies for this trial should be retained in a safe and secure place at all times during the trial.   
18F-AV-1451 and Florbetapir F 18 Injection s should be 
prepared by a qualified PET manufacturing site and administered by a qualified individual under the investigator’s supervision.  An up- to-date drug 
inventory/dispensing record must be maintained and all drug supplies must be justified .  After completion of the trial, all remaining clinical supplies must be 
returned to the sponsor, or their representative.   
 
10.6 Data Collection  
 
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs ) will be used for this trial.  Individual patient 
files should include appropriate source documents, including but not limited to 
patient’s medical records and laboratory test results.  The files should include information such as visit dates, records of medical history, examinations administered, laboratory, concomitant treatment, any adverse event encountered and other notes as appropriate.  These constitute “source data”.  All entries on the eCRFs must be backed up by [CONTACT_112099].  Original electronic v ersions of imaging 
studies are also considered source data and should be kept on file by [CONTACT_779]/imaging center , and appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_209112].   
 
Protocol  18F-AV-1451- A11:  “18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging in Professional Fighters”    
 
Page 33 of 38 
 Each patient’s source file should include an original signed informed consent form.  
When the trial is completed, the informed consent form should be kept on file with other trial related records.  
 All original laboratory reports must be available for review in each patient’s file.  It is important that the  original reports be available for review because of the 
possibility of inaccuracies or errors in transcribing data from original records to the eCRF.  
 
The eCRFs must be kept in order and up- to-date so that they always reflect the 
latest observations on the subjects that are enrolled in the trial.  The eCRFs must be 
completed for each patient enrolled in the trial and signed by [CONTACT_093].  This should be done as soon as possible after completion of the patient’s participation in the trial.  A monitor  will verify the source data f or all information on the eCRF. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_249989] be notified immediately (as soon as possible, and in all cases within 24 hours) of a drug experience, condition, development, or event, which is considered serious. Eli Lilly must be notified immediately of any findings with the use of the drug that may suggest significant hazards, contraindications, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and precautions pertinent to the safety of the drug.  The investigator will be requested to complete a separate report form in addition to the information on the e CRF.  See section 7.7.4 for reporting serious adverse events 
 If a SAE is determined to be unexpected (not previously reported or described by [CONTACT_176105]), and study drug- related, Eli Lilly will notify the investigator in writing.  The 
investigator should forward this notification to the IRB within 24 hours of receipt. 
 
10.8 Records Retention  
 
All co rrespondence (e.g., with Avid, IRB, etc.) relating to this clinical trial should 
be kept in appropriate file folders.  Records of subjects, source documents, and 
drug inventory sheets pertaining to the trial must be kept on file.  Records must be retained until the date a marketing application (NDA) is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated, or until 2 years following the date 
of clinical trial termination or completion, whichever is later.   If no application is to be filed , or if the application is not approved for such indication, records should be 
kept until 2 years following the date of clinical trial termination or completion.  
 If an investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who

VA Medical Centers are beginning to offer eligible Veterans lung can cer screening following 
national recommendations including the US Preventive Services Task Force’s “B” 
recommendation for annual screening. 1  Preliminary evidence from the VA Lung Cancer 
Screening Demonstration Projec t suggests that 900,000 Veterans will be eligible for screening 
and over half will be current smokers with a long history of smoking. 2 3  It is critical that offering 
screening to  current smokers reinforces the importance of cessation and does not reduce 
motivation to quit. 4, 5  Providing cessation support as part of lung cancer screening is mandated 
for reimbursement by [CONTACT_412517], and is recognized by [CONTACT_412518] 
a critical component of delivering high quality care. Integrating cessation counseling 
challenging, in part because of limited time and clinic resources, but also because  of many 
current smokers’ misperception that screening provides a “protective” effect. 6 In the National 
Lung Screening Trial, primary care providers offering screening adequately addressed smoking 
cessation with only 10% of current smokers. [ADDRESS_520072] emphasized the importance of providing both 
behavioral and pharmacotherapy support at every opportunity. Cessation support will be 
integrated with the reporting of screening results. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_412498], we increased participation in behavioral 
cessation treatment to 44% among participants who received proactive counseling from 11% 
among control patients who did not receive proactive counseling, and  quit rates more than 
doubled to 19% in the proactive group from 7% in the control group. [ADDRESS_520073] sho wn that providing 
pharmacotherapy support to all current smokers using an opt -out approach (rather than 
requiring patients to request treatment) significantly increases quit rates, and providers have 
begun adopting opt -out approaches to offering tobacco tr eatment. 
The PROACT trial is a  pragmatic randomized trial targeting  the care of current smokers who are 
participating in lung cancer screening at VA Providence (Rhode Island) and VA NY Harbor.  
Primary care p roviders at VA Providence and VA NY Harbor will b e randomized to provide their 
patients either proactive  cessation support or unstructured  cessation support (as usually 
provided during lung cancer screening ). The proactive  cessation support  will ensure that 
patients receive more elements of care that are  currently available in VA but are not always 
systematically provided, specifically including telephone counseling from VA Quitline counselors 
and pharmacotherapy support recommended by [CONTACT_20248]’s national formulary. The primary endpoint 
is biochemically confirm ed 7-day abstinence [ADDRESS_520074] an improvement in quit rates from 9% with 5A’s 
counseling and unstructured treatment to at least 18% with proactive treatment.

Smoking  remains  the leading  preventabl e cause  of death  and morbidity  among  
Veterans . Cigarette smoking  is responsible  for over 440,000  deaths  annually  and adds  $[ADDRESS_520078]  health  care expenditures  and productivity  losses  each  year in the U.S. Over  
50% of ever-smokers  in the U.S. population  have  been  able to successfully  stop smok ing. [ADDRESS_520079]-traumatic  stress  disorder .11,12 
 
Tobacco treatment is effective but underutilized . Connecting smoke rs to pharmacotherapy 
and behavioral support has been shown  to increase quit rates.13 Although VA has pi[INVESTIGATOR_214669] a 
wide range of cessation services , they are not fully utilized.14,15 While VA has very high rates 
(>80%) of primary  care providers following Public Health Service guidelines for addressing 
smoking cessation  during clinic visits, including the 5A’s , fewe r than 10% of smokers utilize  
pharmacotherapy or other smoking cessati on aids.16,17 This is similar to a recent review of 
Medicaid and Medicare data , which found that only 7.6% of current smokers received a 
prescriptio n or order for a nicotine dependence medication.[ADDRESS_520080] be en 
firmly established as a critical component of successfully quitting.19, 20 The value of  
pharmacotherapy support  may be especially  important for Veterans who current ly smoke 
beca use of their high levels of nicotine dependence. 11,23  
 
No model exists for integrating cessation c ounseling into lung cancer screening.  The 
National Lung Screening Tria l (NLST) struggled with providing smoking cessat ion support to its 
trial enrollees  during the screening process . Primary care providers in the NLST were instructed 
to follow the 5As in a ddressing smoking cessation when offering screening. However , only 10%  
of current smokers received adequate support. [ADDRESS_520081] po pulations including 
minorities, prisoners, or institutionalized individuals will not be targeted for inclusion. The age 
criteria for lung cancer screening of 55 -80 and the smoking history criteria of 30+ pack -year 
history of smoki ng will limit eligibility of pregnant women, and  if pregnant women meet the 
eligibility criteria for screening they will not be eligible to participate in the study.  No children 
(anyone under the age of 18) will be eligible to be included in  the subject po pulation. Patient

3.[ADDRESS_520082] the value of systemati cally providing evidence -based tobacco 
treatment using a pragmatic tri al of providers whose patients receive lung canc er screening in 
two VA Medical Centers – [LOCATION_001] Harbor and Providence. Currently providers are 
encouraged to ask patients about their re adiness to quit and use their judgement to arrange 
treatment (5As fram ework: Ask, Advise, Asses, Assist, Arrange). Pro viders have many 
resources to support cessation, including the VA Quitline (1 -855-QUIT -VET) for behavioral 
counseling support and VA formu lary guidelines for smoking cessation pharmacotherapy.  
Providers will be randomized to two study arms. In one arm, Pro viders will not receive any 
additional guidance from the study team about how to effectively utilize available VA resource. 
This arm is la beled as the unstructured  care arm.  
The study team will develop a pro active, automated structure in which all VA reso urces are 
combined into a template that is proactively activated by a patient’s screening results letter. This 
template will reflect pharm acy ordering instructions and other pathways activities in place at th e 
study site. This will be considered proactive  care. Primary care providers offering proactive  
smoking cessation care will be provided guidance to offer cessation pharmacotherapy  to all  
current smokers when notifying the patient of the results of their sc reening test. Patients of 
providers in the proac tive care arm will also uniformly receive  proactive telephone outrea ch from 
VA Quitline counselors, which will review the screening result s letter and any provided 
pharmacotherapy. Each local screening progra m will send a standardized letter notifying the 
patient that they will be proactively contact[CONTACT_426] a telephone counselor. This letter will be in 
addition to any individualized letters/te lephone reporting of results of their screening test by [CONTACT_4677]’s provider.   
The primary aim of this trial is to:  
 
1. Conduct a pragmatic randomized trial among smokers participating in lung cancer screening 
comparing  proactive smoking cessation care  with unstructured care .  We will assess the 
differences between the two c are approaches on 7-day smoking abstinence [ADDRESS_520083] 540 patien ts responding (270 responders per arm) to the 12 -month 
survey. Based o n our preliminary findings in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] p roactive care, and related trials 
in other populations of smokers, we hypothesize that smoking abstinence 12 months after 
screening will b e twice as high (18%) in the proactive group compared to expected 
abstinence rates in the unstructured group (9%).9 
 
The secondary aims are to:  
2a. Assess whether proactive  smoking cessation care  impacts three psycholo gical and two 
behavioral change processes derived from health behavior  change theory, including: (a) 
motivation, (b) p erceived susceptibility to the harmful effects of smoking, (c) self -efficacy for 
quitting, (d) likelihood of making a quit attempt, and (e ) likelihood of utilizing 
pharmacotherapy.  
Zeliadt PROACT 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/[ADDRESS_520084] re view, will be conducted at the Seattle/Denver HSR&D 
Center of Innovati on (COIN) in Seattle, which will serve as the st udy Coordinating Center. The 
Coordinating Center will identify eligible provider  participants by [CONTACT_412519].  After 
identifying  providers  historically performin g lung cancer screening at the two study sites , the 
Coordinating Center will  send them an information sheet describing the study, includin g the 
randomization process and procedures for declining participation  in the study, via mail, email , 
and Lync instant  message .  
In collaboration with providers  and lung cancer screening care providers, the Coordinating 
Center will work with local coordina tors at the two study sites to structure care for the proactive 
care arm. The local coordinator will be notified by [CONTACT_3433] e Coordinating Center of each provider’s 
randomization assignment.  Following randomization, providers assigned to the proactive arm 
will b e sent an email notifying them of which arm they are assigned to  and w hat intervention  
activities  to expect going forw ard. They will receive a similar notification email after ordering 
their first lung cancer screening  test, following the start of the stud y. No notifications will be sent 
to providers in the unstructured arm.  Providers will remain randomized to a single st udy arm for 
the duration of the trial. If a new provider orders a lung cancer screening test for the first time, 
he or she will be approac hed similarly recognizing that the care of the patient that alerted th e 
Coordinating Center to the provider’s identity  may not be influenced by [CONTACT_412520] -out 
consent and randomization process cannot occur before the screening test is performed.  
Once providers have been randomized, we will monitor for prospective patients referred for 
screening. The Coordinatin g Center will review all prospective patients for study eligibility, 
confirming the patient is documented in the EHR as a current smoker.   
 
For providers assigned to the proactive arm, local coordinators wil l review prior cessation 
medication history in e ach patient’s chart and enter a note to the provider recommending 
providing cessation medication as patients are receiving their screening  results. Local 
coordinators will follow national and local VA treatme nt guidelines in recommending a cessation 
medica tion to the provider ( https://www.publicheal th.va.gov 
/docs/smoking/cessationguidelinepart2_508.pdf# ).  Study cli nicians (Au, Feemster , Becker ) will 
be available  to local coordinators to answer any questions with interpreting VA treatment 
guidelines. Local coordinators will be trained by [CONTACT_412521], such as order ing templates created by [CONTACT_412522]. The proactive 
note to the provider will provide a summary of clinical logic and confirm that the coordinator 
assessed any potential contraindi cations, such as unstable angina or serious arrhythmia. Local 
coordina tors will also be available to providers to help  facilitate all proactive care activities, 
including refill monitoring for prescribed cessation medications.  
Zeliadt PROACT 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/[ADDRESS_520085] did not identify findings

Data Use Agreemen ts (DUAs) . DUAs w ill be executed with th e VA National Corporate Data 
Warehouse (CDW) r epository and CAPRI/JLV  for access and use of data and subject records.  
Data will be obtained electronically from the VA National Corporate  Data Warehouse (CDW) 
reposito ry, which the stu dy team will access via  the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure  
(VINCI) platform . Variables from the CDW will be used to identify referral for lung cancer 
screening and current smoking status at the ti me of screening.   Patient cont act information, 
including phone number,  will be accessed for proactive telephone counseling, and mailing 
address information will be used for inviting participants to complete the 3 - and 12 -month study 
surveys. Social securit y numbers will be used for res earch staff to lo ok up patient medical 
records in CAPRI/JLV  as well as to enter notes into CPRS. SSNs are also required by [CONTACT_41309] 
R&D Purchasing and Fiscal Office to process checks for payments.  
 
The Coordinating Center staff will obtain CAPRI /JLV access f ollowing VHA proc edures that 
serve as an  agreement to adhere to conditions of electronic health records access and use 
stipulated by [CONTACT_412523] (HIA) .  The purpose of accessing patient records is 
to confirm i nformation identified in CDW n otes about comorb idities and exclusion c riteria to

Contracted Services.  We will enter into a contract  with the Seattle -based Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center’s Cancer Information Service (CIS)  to provide individualized smoking 
cessation counseling to the patients in the proactive care arm of the study. This will facilit ate 
careful tracking of servic es provided and c ost estimates.  The CIS is an NCI -funded national 
telephone clearinghouse of cancer information serving individuals who have questions about 
cancer prevention and treatment. They are knowledgeable, caring, and experienced at 
explaining medi cal information. Their service s are confidential. The CIS operates  both the 
general information line (1 -800-4-CANCER)  which helps counsel patients about diagnosis and 
treatment options, and the NCI's Smoking Quitline (1 -877-44U-QUIT), which provides free 
cessation informat ion and support to smok ers who wish to quit free of charge.  
 
The CIS also contracts nationally with VHA to provide the VA Quitline (1 -855-QUIT -VET) which 
is free to all Veterans. We  will contract with CIS to  develop a database  to track uti lization and 
cond uct counseling calls.  They will use the database to provide information about completed 
telephone sessions, treatment fidelity, and cost of service provision.  Veteran s’ contact 
[CONTACT_412524] d as patients  of 
provid ers randomized to the proactive care arm. The telephone counselors will make 3 attempts 
to reach each Veteran, leaving voicemails with a specific telephone number that will reach a VA 
Quitline counselor who is traine d in the study co unseling activities. (S ee National telephone 
counselor introductory script ). 
 
The VA Quitline counselor will attempt to provide [ADDRESS_520088] the 2nd session.  A Ve teran can decline 
participation in the counseling activity. (See  National telephone counselor introductory script ). 
 
The VA Puget Sound Healthcare System is purchasing services from Cancer Information Service 
at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and will enter into a D ata Use Agreement to 
facilitate and allow the exchange of PHI between these two entities.  The DUA will follow ORD 
policies regarding data exchange with Non -Federal Entities and will requ ire approval by [CONTACT_412525], and aut horities at the Fred Hu tchinson Cancer 
Research Center  (see https://ww.research.va.gov/resources/policies/default .cfm). 
 
The VA Quitline routi nely records coun seling calls for qualit y assurance purposes. We have 
applied for a waiver of informed consent to obtain patient data from these quality assurance 
recordings, in order to conduct a fidelity evaluation of a samp le of the calls.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_520089] 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/[ADDRESS_520090] udy sites . Although national 
lung cancer screening recommendations highlight integrating cessation support for current 
smokers (and reimburs ement of lung cancer screening by M edicare is contingent on 
documentat ion that cessation support wa s provided), ther e are currently no established 
methods for how cessation support should be integrated into the delivery of screening care. The 
proactive car e activities are designed to reflec t guidelines from the broader prima ry care setting 
based on deca des of evidence t hat both behavioral and pharmacotherapy support should be 
routinely provided to patients. Additionally, the study focuses on testing a proac tive care 
approach that has potenti al for broad dissemination national ly across VA, including centr alized 
proactive telephone counseling using VA Quitline counselors and providing cessation 
pharmacotherapy in accordance with VA formulary guidelines. We wil l standardize study 
activities as m uch as possible to ensure they are provided uniformly, however, as this is a 
pragmatic trial of care as it is delivered in actual practice, providers  may vary how they deliver 
the intended proactive and unstructured care components.  
At the beginning of the  study, the Coordinating Center, lo cated in Seattle, will access  
retrospective Co rporate Data Warehouse (CDW) patient data to identify providers who have 
ordered lung cancer screening CTs in the past. These data will be f rom CDW accessed through 
VINCI and will be used to review provider lun g cancer screening volume and  provider’s 
histo rical use of cessation medications ordered at the time of lung cancer screening. 
Throughout the study, the Coordinating Center will also pro spectively identify patients 
schedu led for lung cancer screening by [CONTACT_412526]. The Coordinating Cent er 
will confirm the scheduled patient’s eligibility criteria, including current smoking status  through 
CAPRI/JLV . A local clinical coordinat or based at either of the intervent ion sites (NY Harbor or 
Providence,  RI) will be notified when pa tient eligibility  is confirmed and the ordering provider is 
identified. The local coordinator will work with the provider subjects at the intervention sites to 
adapt study guidance to the lung  cancer screening clinical pathways  in use at each of the 
interv ention sites.  On ce a patient’s screening results are available, the study team will confirm 
continued eligibility (e.g. no indication of a highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_412500]).  
For pa tients of providers assigned to the  proactive study group, the l ocal coordinator will review 
the patient’s cessation medication history  in CAPRI/JLV . If the patient is not currently being 
provided cessation support medica tion, the coordinator will enter a note for the provider about 
the rec ommended medication indicated  by [CONTACT_412527].  
For those patients receiving proactive care,  once the screening results are available and 
patients are confirmed to meet eligib ility criteria , including not havin g findings requiring 
immediate foll ow-up (e.g. LungRADS 4 or 5),  each local scree ning program will send a 
standardized letter notifying the patient that they will be proactively contact[CONTACT_426] a telephone 
counselor. This le tter will be in addition to any ind ividualized letters/telephone repor ting of 
results of their scre ening test by [CONTACT_8130]’s provider.    
Zeliadt PROACT 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/[ADDRESS_520091] information 
about the non-suspi[INVESTIGATOR_82597] s screening result , s to the VA Qui tline via secured fax.  A VA Quitlin e 
counselor will attempt to p rovide two sessio ns of proactive telephone support.   
Three months after the date of the screening procedure, the Coordinating Center will invite 
patient part icipants to participate in an evalu ation survey. A second evaluation s urvey will be 
sent to the pat ient at 12 months . Participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_520092] ed for all invited patients, including those who do not 
complete the evaluation surveys.  
Provider p articipan ts in the proacti ve arm will be sent a short evaluation survey via email. The  
survey will assess providers’ evaluation of the value of proactive ca re. If providers offer lung 
cancer screening to multiple patient, the survey will only be sent once per quart er. 
As a pragmatic trial, provider part icipants in the proactive arm will be sent periodic study status 
update s via email . These emails  will includ e study level feedback on cessation medication 
prescription rates and reminders to continue proactiv ely pres cribing the recommen ded 
medications . It will also include general study update s as well as feedback  by [CONTACT_412528] , coordinating center  and Quitline counselors that will be of interest to 
providers  and help them unde rstand ho w patients are resp onding to partici pating in the stu dy.  
Cost and reso urce a ssessment . Cost and resource data will be collected as part of the stu dy, 
including the cost of provided pharmacotherapy, additional medication fills, and cost of 
telepho ne counse lor contact. A waiv er of informed consent to collect this information o n all 
study participants is requested.  
Risks associated with provider assign ment to interv ention. The risks associated with the 
study activities are minimal. All patient partic ipants ar e current smokers, and VA and US 
Public Health Services guideline recom mend c linicians provide cessation support at all clinic 
visits and as part o f lung cancer screening.  
 
The difference in risks associated with behavioral counseling between the  unstruct ured and 
proactive arms are minor.  In the unstructured arm, patients r eceive  about cessation 
counseling by [CONTACT_412529] e VA Quitline’ s telephone number (1 -
855-QUIT -VET) as a free resource for telephone counseling. In th e proacti ve arm, subjects 
are proactively contact[CONTACT_412530] r eceive  this same support. The 
proactive counseling calls may be associated w ith the follow ing risks: 1) annoyance from 
proactive counseling outreach, or 2) increased anxiety or  worry re lated to discussion s around 
lung cancer screening results and smoking c essati on with VA Quitline telephone counselors. 
We will mitigate this risk b y having the V A Qu itline caller remind subjects that participation in 
the proactive calls is volunta ry. Notab ly, in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_39400] 89% of Veterans indicated they 
were completely o r some what satisfied with the proactive telephone counseling calls, with 1 
individual repo rting they were neither satisfied or dissatisfied, and 2 participants declining to 
respond.  
 
The difference in ris ks associated with pharmacotherapy support between t he uns tructured 
and proactive arms is also minimal. Although guidelines indi cate all smoke rs should be 
offered pharmacotherapy support at every visit, this happens infrequently . A recen t review 
found that  only 7.6% of current smokers received a cessation p harmac otherapy order 
Zeliadt PROACT 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/2012  Page 14 of 27 
 following a primary care visit, 18 and fewer than 10% of smokers participating in screening in 
the NLST received such  an order .17  Patients  who a re current smokers should be 
appropriately provided with s moking cessation support as they participate in lung cancer 
screening,  although this  doesn’t consistently happen. A potential risk of this study is that 
current smokers r eceiving care from providers  in the unstructured care group who are eligible 
for behav ioral counseling or pharmacologic cessation support will not receive i t. Another 
potential risk is that providers in the proactive care group will perceive that the study  is 
assum ing responsibility for providing cessation support and the quality of s upport  offered by 
[CONTACT_412531].  The primary difference between th e study arms i s encouraging 
providers assigned to proactive care to remove the precondition to provi ding 
pharmacotherapy that th e patient set a quit date and offer pharmacotherapy to all  screening 
participants who are current smokers. This is intended to r esult in more patients in the 
proactive care arm receiving pharmacotherapy and  may be associated wit h 1) inap propriate 
use of ce ssation medications, or 2) risks associated with us e of ce ssation medications. We 
will encourage providers to follow VHA formula ry guidelines for recommending 
pharmacotherapy including assessment of contraindications, and all or ders are required to be 
signed by a primary care provider  associated with the p atient . The local coordinator will 
review patients’ medication history as wel l as any poten tial medication risk factors and  
provide a note in CPRS with a summary for the provide r to assi st in assessing pot ential 
contraindications and facilitating adherenc e to VHA  formulary guidelines.  
 
We also note that following publication of a large double -blind, placebo controlled trial 
specifically designed to assess risks of cessation phar macothera pi[INVESTIGATOR_412501], varenicline and buprop ion, 22 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
determined  the risk of serious side effects on mood, behavior, or thinking with the stop -smoking  
medicine s varenicline and b upropi[INVESTIGATOR_412502] a black 
box warning previously placed on varenicline. The risk of these mental health side effects was 
equivalent among all forms of medications in the trial. The results o f the tri al confirm that the  
benefits of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_412503], so the main risk in this 
study is that cessation rates will  be lower amon g one of the study arm s. 
 
Risks associated with survey and administrative data collect ion. The main potential 
research risk to patient subjects is loss of confide ntiality o f personal information, including CDW 
data, information present in the ir electronic patient medical records, information collected by [CONTACT_412532], or infor mation sh ared via the study survey.  We will take multiple 
precautions to pr otect conf identiality while working with primary and secondary data, as well as 
extra precauti ons with the collection and exchange of subject data with CIS.  
 
Potential risks to pat ient subj ects may also inclu de emotional distress from responding to survey 
questions,  which might cause confusion or make them uncomfortable. Patients may also feel 
pressure to participate in the survey unwillingly because they mistakenly fear their acces s to

provided in writing in the information sheet: that t heir decision not to participate in the survey will 
be kept confidential, and will in no way affect their acc ess to services or the quality of care they

Minimization of risk . We will obtain IRB approval prior to initiating any study act ivities. Prior  to 
study commencement, all members of the research team will complete trainings in hu man 
subje ct protection and e thical research practices, as required by [CONTACT_1744].  Approvals from the VA 
Information Security Officer (ISO), VA Privacy Officer (PO ), and Researc h and Development

to dispensing.  A s tudy clinician  (Drs. Feemster or Au) will be available to the all study personnel 
for additional gui dance if necessary. Although  the local coordinator will enter a recommendati on 
in the note, the provider may opt for an alternate treatment type within the VA formulary ( or 
none at all).  
 
Detailed VA educational materials will accompany all cessation medi cations a nd are provided 
by [CONTACT_412533] s ent. These  materials will remind patients of 
any potential contraindications. Ad ditionally, VA  Quitline counselors will have copi[INVESTIGATOR_412504]. Quitline counselors will help patients

Infrastructure (VINCI), in  conjunct ion with our COIN D atabase Administrator, will facilitate the 
secur e, electro nic data transfer from the VA data repertories, including CDW, and Vit al Status 
data to COIN servers. Study staff will execute Data Use Agreements with CDW and CAPRI/JLV  
prior to use of any reposito ry data, and comply with the stipulations outl ined in the agreement 
contracts.  
 
We will protect the confidentiality of VA patie nt data throug h a number of procedures.  We will 
limit our acquisition of identifiable information t o the min imum amount of info rmation necessary 
to link subject data, obtain c ontact inf ormation for recruitment of subjects, and collect pertinent 
data neces sary to comple te the study aims. To ensure confidentiality and protection of subject 
data, data will  only be analyzed and stored  electronically on secure servers at the COIN. T he 
study t eam will be trained and reminded to not save copi[INVESTIGATOR_412506]. Only secure VA remote access will be used to access the data.  Anti -virus protec tion is 
maintained on all se rvers and workstations at the COIN office.  All workstatio ns and servers are 
physically secured in locked offices, reside behind  the VA firewa ll, and fully participate in 
Windows NT security. We will store the identifier crosswa lk in a s eparate data file l ocation, 
accessible only by [CONTACT_412535] r and study PIs. Access to the study data 
folder will be restricted to  those VA stud y project staff approved by [CONTACT_412536]. The data 
study folder will be further sa fe-guarde d against unauthori zed access by [CONTACT_412537].  In no case will patient identifiers or data be provided to any person  or 
entity out side the IRB -approved project team, and we will ensure that all study results are 
presented in a way that no indiv idual can be identified.  
 
In order to ensure Vet eran conta ct data is protected as it is provided to the VA Quitline, we will 
utilize a secure fax line to send instructions to VA Quitline for contact[CONTACT_412538]. Thi s will be reviewed by [CONTACT_412539] a nd 
described in the Data Use Agreement between VA Puget Sound and the VA Quitline.  
 
The VA Quitline will follow current procedures for protecting data with two exception s. The VA

of the data will require approval of a written protocol by [CONTACT_412543]’s co ntrolling IRB as 
well as their local R&D committee.  In no case will patient identifie rs or dat a be provided to an y 
person or entity outside the IRB -approved proj ect team, and we will ensure that all study results 
are presented in a way that no individual can be identified.  
 
Analysis of risk vs. potential benefit . The benefits outweigh the  risks in volved, especially 
given that this is a study assessing the effecti veness of an implementation strategy (using 
proactive notes to providers and a c entralized tel epho ne counseling resource) in promoting the 
adoption of what is considered high quali ty care b ut often is not rou tinely provided to patients 
due to limited clini cal time.  
 
Subjects receiving proactive care will receive support related to scr eening and hel p 
understanding their screening result, counseling about smoking cessation services an d support  
for use of cessati on medications. The counseling sessions provided  by [CONTACT_412544]. The study also en courages providers to provid e 
cessation medication, and participants could b enefit by [CONTACT_412545]. 
The intervention could have a p ositive influe nce on subjects’ health behaviors, such as 
connecting them to additional smoking cessa tion serv ices such as group counseling or 
additional telephone counseling. P otential b enefits could also come from the overall contribution 
of the study fin dings to care for future Veterans and help improving the healthcare field in 
general. Possible study  findings  could lead to impl ementation of improved care practices and/or 
services, whi ch may include expansion of smoking cessation services through increas ed 
understandi ng and funding allocation for smoking cessation resources and heightened public 
awaren ess of th e health benefits o f smoking cessation.  
 
5.2 Recruitment Methods  
 
Number of S ubjects Needed.  
Patients . We will assess CDW and CAPRI/JLV  records fo r up to 15,000  patients (~10,000 to 
identify retrospective LCS orders, and ~5,000 to identify prospe ctive LCS  orders) who were 
offered lung cancer screening at NY Harbor and Pr ovidence t o identify potential provider 
participants. Of these subjects, only cu rrent smokers will be approached. We anticipate 
approaching up to 1,350 eligible potential subjects (mailing them a study invita tion packet) to 
invite them to participate in th e survey. In order to ensure non -missing data are available on a 
sufficiently po wered study sa mple , recruitment will continue until [ADDRESS_520096] completed 
the 12 -month assessm ent surve y in each of the ca re arms (total target n = 540).  
Providers . We e xpect to r ecruit approximately 300 providers, 180 from Providence, RI 
and 120 fr om NY Harbor, in order to reach 540 patients (completed surveys).  
Zeliadt PROACT 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/[ADDRESS_520097] previously ordered L CS tests. Providers who meet eligibility will 
then be contact[CONTACT_235514], then e mail, and fina lly by [CONTACT_412546]/Skype for Business instant message 
and given the recruitment materials. An y new pro viders who are hire d at VA NY Harbor or 
Providence  and are eligible  to order a LCS CT scan , who were not identified by [CONTACT_412547] , will be similarly r ecruited when they are first identified.   
Patients . We will obtain a HIPAA Waiver and Waiver of  Informed Consent f or recruitment to 
facilitate the identification of provide rs’ eligible patients. The study team will query the CDW 
twice weekly  over 5 quarter s (15 months)  to identify study providers’ recently ordered LCS CT 
scans at the NY Har bor and P rovidence, RI VAs. Upon discovery that a screening CT has been 
ordered, the study team will review the patient’s chart to assess for eligibility/in eligibility cr iteria 
and, if patient is eligible , enter patient information into a tracking system. At 2.[ADDRESS_520098]. Current smokers 
receiving unstructured or proactive care who meet gen eral elig ibility criteria according to the 
National Center for Health Promot ion and Di sease Prevention Guidelines  for lung cancer 
screening (including age,  comorbidity, a nd other health history eligibility criteria , as detailed 
below in Inclusion and Exclu sion Crit eria) will be conta cted by [CONTACT_139576] 3 months following their 
LCS. Th e study pa cket will include an Information Sheet  (included in Appendix ) and the printed 
survey  (included in Appendix ). If the mailed survey has not been received  by [CONTACT_412548] [ADDRESS_520099]  five attempts  to complete  
the telephone  version  of the survey  (one call per day; see appendix conta ining follow -up 
telephone script for unreturned surveys).  If no telephone contact [CONTACT_194276],  we will mail a 2nd 
attempt of the full survey. We will conduct a 3rd mailing of a shorter survey focusing on the 
primary outcomes to subjects who d o not complete  the full survey  within [ADDRESS_520100] is willing.   Please refer to the 
teleph one script  for patient callers requesting additional information or to opt -out of calls  
(included in  Appendix ) for language to a nswer potential questions from patients regardin g 
privacy and legal concerns. We will offer to mail the patient a copy of the No tice of Privac y 
Practices upon request. We will use an “Address  Service Requested” envelope, for aut omatic 
forwarding to new mai ling addresses. The same schedule  of mailing and  phone cal ls will be 
followed for the 12 -month survey.  Subjects who do not resp ond to the 3 -month survey will be 
mailed a 12 -month survey, altered to include some of the questions  from the  missing 3 -month 
survey (included in attachments) .   
Payment s to Subj ects.  Subjects will  be informed as part of the initial information sheet when 
the surveys are mailed that they will receive  a $25 check for complet ion of each su rvey (at 3 
and 12 months after lung cancer screening).   
The information sheet also clar ifies that the study team and VA Pharmacy are working together 
to ensure that any co-payments for medications received as part of the study will be paid by 
[CONTACT_412549] t he partic ipant.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_520101] 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/[ADDRESS_520102] designed an opt -out approach to help lead 
to a wide ra nge o f provide r participation, as requiring providers to opt -in to study participation 
would potenti ally bias  the results or mak e them generalizable only to a small subset of p roviders 
and no t VA overall.  
 
We will send all primary care providers who are or derin g lung ca ncer screening tests a letter and 
Information Sheet  in the postal mail to their office  mailing address.  We will  then send a copy of the 
letter and  Information She et via email , and finally  follow up via Lync/Skype for Business  (instant 
message , with link to  Information Sheet  and invitation letter in PDF format  attached ). In each 
communicatio n, we wil l make clear that i f we do not hear back from them, they will be en rolled in 
the s tudy.  
 
Patients  
 
A Waiver of Informed Consent is requested for admini strative medi cal record review of 
historical provider screening volumes . In order to ensure bal ance in r andomization by [CONTACT_412550] (as some providers order hundreds o f screening CTs  per year and other providers order 
only one or two), we are requ esting access to patient screening data between 1/1/2013 and 
12/31/2017.  We will need to access tho usands of  records in the Cor porate Data Warehouse as 
NY Harbor and Providenc e have screened  an estimated [ADDRESS_520103] data for all participants who  do (and do not) respond to the 3 - or 12 -
month survey in order to  docu ment pote ntial differences between patients who complete the 
survey and those who do not (e.g. age/comor bidity) , and to con duct an administrative assessment 
of administrat ive cessation outcomes such as subsequent documentation by [CONTACT_412551] l record of continued smoking or cessation.  
 
Alteration of Informed Consent Process. We are req uesting a  waiver of document ation of 
informed consent for survey participati on. We will mai l participants an evaluation survey at [ADDRESS_520104] scan; we are requesting that returning the survey 
serve as a substitute for docu mentation  of informed consen t. Requiring participants to complete a 
written informed consen t document in addition to the survey would be unnecessarily burde nsome . 
 
Zeliadt PROACT 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/[ADDRESS_520105] been trained and will remain current with the  VA 
requi rements for Human S ubjects Protections and Good Clinical Practices.

are not already currently being prescribed smoking cessation medications , will be 
excluded  until mechanis ms w ith clinical pharmacy  have been established to ensure 
these patients do not receive a co -pay.  
 
5.5 Study Evaluations  
 
Patient evaluations . The study team will query CDW twice weekly to identify scheduled  LCS 
tests at t he NY  Harbo r and Providen ce VAs. Eligibility for lung cancer screening requires the 
patient’s provider  conduct a thorough  assessment of a patient’s smoking hist ory to ensure they 
have smo ked at least [ADDRESS_520107] information about their screening  results, including 
withdra wing those few individuals (<4%) who are identified with highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_412508]. For subjects receiving pro active 
care, we will extract information about me dications provided by [CONTACT_941] p rovider, and date their 
contact [CONTACT_412552] e.  
The tracking sys tem will prompt Coordinating Center staff at 2.5 months following the date of 
the pati ent’s LCS test . We will re -confirm their eligibil ity, reviewing any changes to their 
screening results associated with repeat tests in CDW, and  will m ail a 3-month assess ment  
survey using the mailing address information in the EMR . If the mailed survey has  not been 
received by [CONTACT_126786] [ADDRESS_520108] five attempts to complete the telepho ne ver sion of the su rvey (one call per day). If no 
telephone contact [CONTACT_194276], we will mail a 2nd attem pt of the full survey. We will conduct a 
3rd mail ing of a shorter survey foc using on the primary outcomes to subjects who do not 
complete the full sur vey wi thin [ADDRESS_520109] is willing .   Please refer to the Telephone Script (included in Ap pendix ) for 
language  to answ er potential questions from patients regarding privacy and legal concerns. We 
will offer to mail the patient a copy of the Noti ce of Privacy Practices upo n request. We will use 
an “Address Service Requested” envelope, for automa tic fo rwarding to ne w ma iling addresses.  
The same schedule of mailing and phone ca lls will be followed for the 12 -month survey.  
Subjects who do not respond  to the 3 -month survey will  be mailed a 12 -month survey, altered to 
include some of the questions fro m the missing 3 -mont h survey (included in attachments) , 
unless they have contact[CONTACT_412553] .  
 
Zeliadt PROACT 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/2012  Page 22 of 27 
 Provider Ev aluations . A brief email survey will be sent to providers p articipating in the study. 
The main purpose of this brief survey (see Appe ndices ) is to captur e any perceptions by 
[CONTACT_412554], and to g ive providers an 
opportunity to share their experiences abo ut the study with the study team. If providers have 
offered LCS to more th an one  patient, they  will only receive this survey once per quarter.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_520110] sufficient (80%) power to detect  a doubling 
of abstinence rates (Relative Risk = 2) using a multilevel random effects model with pat ients 
clustered b y randomized provider . The assumed intraclass correlation c oefficient for the 
provider clustering effect is assumed to be 0.01.  Powe r is b ased on a two -sided test with type -1 
alpha error rate of 0.05%. Due to randomization, we do not anti cipate needing to  adjust for 
patient covariates.  
 
Intent -to-treat (ITT) ana lysis We will utilize an intent -to-treat approach and include all 
particip ants w ho meet study eligibility criteria and are assigned to a study arm, regardless of 
whether they parti cipated in all of  the care components of that arm (e.g. declined proactive 
telephone counseling). Our primary analysis will focus on participants for whom w e have 
complet e 12-month abstinence (target n=2 70 per arm).  
 
Missing outcome data . For secondary an alyses, w e will e xamine outcomes for all eligible 
screening patients who are  current smokers offered screening by a participating randomized 
provider during  the study per iod. This analysis will include patients who do not participate in the 
survey assessme nt of cessation o utcomes. We will perform two secondary analyses.  The first  
will assume that patients who do not participate in the survey assessment  (e.g. missing 
absti nenc e outcomes ) will be considered continued smokers, which is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_412509] -to-treat 
approach for c essation trials.  We do not anticipate differential missing data across study arms.  
Second, we will address potential missing cessati on dat a by [CONTACT_412555] g a HIPA A waiver and 
waiver of informed consent to review EMR data for all  eligible pa tients to estimat e an 
administrative assessment of cessation, based on Healt hFactors data and whether patients 
report quitting at a subsequent visit o r when  they return f or annua l lung cancer screening. The 
methods developed by [CONTACT_412556], will be used  to construct thi s administrative cessation 
variable.  
 
(Note, due to COVID pandemic changes in lung cancer scre ening utilizati on and study 
enrol lment timelines, the missing data protocol using EMR data was adapted for the primary 
outcome. See the Statistical Analysis Plan .) 
 
All data will be mai ntained and analyzed at the Seattle offices of the Seattle/Denver Center o f 
Innovation for Vet eran-Centered and Value -Driven Care. [CONTACT_412562] will oversee all project staff 
conduc ting data analysis activities. See below for descrip tion of data and privacy  protections at 
our Center of Innovation.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_520111] 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/2012  Page 23 of 27 
 Patient participants  may be withdrawn without their consent if they no longer meet the study 
eligibility crit eria (e.g. their LCS test or a short -term follow -up test identifies lung can cer or a 
highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_98868], or if the subject becomes pregnant whi ch is unlikely given  the age 
eligibility for LCS). A participant may also be withdrawn if either of the re sponsible VA clinician s, 
Drs. Au or Feemster , deem s it appropriate to ensure  that no harm occurs to the subject.   
Both patient and provider participa nts ma y withdraw fro m the study at any time without incurring 
any consequences. Participants may notify th e study team or Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_412510] y. Contact [CONTACT_412557], including 
on the Information Sh eet and survey mailings provided to all participants. Language 
emphasizing the freedom  to withdraw at any point during the study will be i ncluded on 
communication s with study participants.  
 
6.0 Reporting  
 
Collection of Safety Information. The stu dy activities do not involve any invasive procedure, 
and it is not anticipated that serious adverse events or unanticipated problems will occur , 
includi ng events that would tri gger suspension of research . However, in the rare chance such 
an incident does o ccur, all seri ous adve rse events and unanticipated problems will be reported 
according to regulatory  and reporting requirements outlined in the VHA Hand book 1058.01 
within 5 bu siness days of the incident.  The Coordinating Center will complete and su bmit a n 
Unanticipate d, Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report form or Problem Report for each incident to 
the VA Human Subjects Boards as per the regulatory requi rements at each site and  the study 
protocol.  
 
The project coordinator will be responsible for repo rting relevant infor mation to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a

serious or non -seriou s and b) anticipated or unanticipated. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318] e nsure that any 
necessary  actions are taken immediately to address the current patient situation, a nd the n will 
decide if the team needs to make any changes in the protocol and/or consent forms to prevent 
future occurrences or better inform future participa nts. Any deviation to pr otocol or safety 
concerns resulting from the study will be communicated by  [CONTACT_941] p roject coordin ator via the 
submission of an Unanticipated, Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report form o r Problem Report 
to the VA IRB as per the VHA regula tory requirements and pr otocol, w ithin 5 business days of 
an incident.  
Method of Collection of Saf ety In formation. If the study is made aware of any Adverse 
Events through notification by a study particip ant, VA Quitline Counselor, or email/contact [CONTACT_18904] 
a study provider, the proj ect coordinator will be responsible for completing the above safety & 
regulatory  report forms (i.e., SAE forms), which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_412512]. Adverse 
Events will be reported to the VA Human Subject Review Board using the appropriate Central 
IRB forms . 
Frequency of Safety Data Collection. Oversight of project activ ities and data by [CONTACT_3433] e PI [INVESTIGATOR_412513].  Collection of CDW data will begin as soon as IRB approva l is obtained.  
Twice -weekly lists of potential subj ects will be continued u ntil target recruitment goals are met. 
Zeliadt PROACT 9/29/21 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version  10/26/2012  Page 24 of 27 
 Any event that adversely affects pa rticip ant safety wil l be recorded as soon as possible after it 
occurs and be reported within 24 hours to t he PI.  
Notification of Subjects of Findings Affectin g Health and Welfare . This study does not 
involve any invasive procedure, and it is not anticipate d that  any findings identified by [CONTACT_1758] 
(e.g. survey results) will require notification.  
 
7.0 Privacy and Confidentiality  
 
PHI.  Protected Health Information and personal identifying  information will be obtained from 
existing sources (Corporate Data Wareho use, C APRI/JLV) and from patient subjects. Names, 
social security numbers, birthdates, ages, appointment d ates, treatment dates, date of CT 
screenings, teleph one numbers, and patient  addresses will be obtained. Limited screening data 
will be entered into a n elec tronic subject  tracking database that will be maintained on secure 
servers at the COIN at VA Puget S ound. The tracking database will be used to log subj ect 
recruitment and comp letion of surveys. The tracking database will include subject name, SSN, 
address , phone number , date they were offered lung cancer screening by [CONTACT_412558], and 
date of recei pt of lung cancer screening. The tracking database w ill also serve as the cr osswalk 
between the subject name [CONTACT_412561]  [CONTACT_412559]. Data  
collected as part of this study (subject responses to surveys) will include a study I D with no 
other patient identifiers, and will be sto red separately from the tracking/ crosswalk data.  
 
Data security.   Data collection, storage and m anagem ent for this r esea rch project will adhere to 
all applicable VA policies, the VA Puget Sound Health C are System’s Automated Information

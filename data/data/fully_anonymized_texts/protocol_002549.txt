INTRODUCTION:  
 Men diagnosed with non- palpable, unilateral, low -intermediate risk localized prostate 
cancer (defined as clinical stage T2a, PSA<10ng/ml, Gleason score <=7 , in only one side 
of the prostate) and multi -parametric endo -rectal MRI with no lesions or lesions less than 
1cm. in diameter  and only on one side of the prostate  are eligible for this study. Initial 
biopsy would need to have a minimum of [ADDRESS_808507] a high level of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_609784] (right or left, Central or 
peripheral gland) and categorized from 1 Negative to 5 highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665].  For study purposes, the prostate is divided into four regions: RIGHT CENTRAL, RIGHT PERIPHERAL, LEFT CENTRAL and LEFT PERIPHERAL.  Patients mus t meet the 
original entry criteria on this repeat mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609785]. If the patients meet the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -biopsy enrollment criteria, they are treated with focal 
bipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA)  meaning RFA of the sites wh ere the biopsies 
were positive but no more than one prostate side. Efficacy is defined as negative biopsy cores at the sites of the focal ablation on repeat extended biopsies at [ADDRESS_808508] prior to the 6 month repeat saturation biopsy performed identical to the original pre -treatment biopsy.   
 At baseline (prior to pre -treatment biopsy) and at 6 months (prior to the repeat biopsy 
used to define efficacy) the patient will complete an American Urologic Association  
lower urinary tract symptom score assessment (AUA score), Rectal Assessment Scale (RAS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF -5), and the EPIC quality of life 
questionnaires.  Following completion of the focal prostate radio -frequency ablation study at [ADDRESS_808509]/routine care including serum PSA level every 6 months and as needed digital rectal examinations; any future prostate biopsies will be performed at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 Patients will also be required to complete a medical resource utilization (MRU) form to 
capture resource utilization between study visits, which can be used to estimate costs associated with procedure related complications and health care visits. Patients wi ll 
requested to complete a weekly diary of medical resource utilization to limit recall bias that may occur between study visits.

 1.0  OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS    
 Primary Objective:  To assess the local oncologic efficacy of focal RFA in men with 
unilateral, clinically localized prostate cancer as measured by [CONTACT_609806], “all negative” means no prostate cancer; if the biopsy contains inflammation, or pre- cancerous changes (high -
grade prostatic intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_69685] /or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_609786]).  Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety of the procedure and change in quality -of-
life indicators from baseline to 6 months following focal RFA in patients with localized 
6 
 
MCC #[ZIP_CODE]  Protocol Version 7/ October 12, 2015 
prostate cancer. To understand and evaluate imaging characteristics of treated prostate cancer by [CONTACT_609807].  
 Tertiary O bjective:  To assess the potential health economic impact of focal RFA based 
on medical resource utilization data.  
 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_609787] a marked increase in the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, and a pro found migration towards earlier stage disease at the time of 
diagnosis. Implementation of large -scale serum prostate- specific antigen (PSA) screening 
programs and more extensive biopsy strategies are largely responsible for the increase in diagnosis. An analysis of the control group in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial illustrates the potential for extensive biopsy to result in over –diagnosis, of prostate 
cancer (Thompson et al.2004).  Among 2,950 men with negative digital rectal examination (DRE) and PSA levels <4.0ng/ml, 15.2% harbored prostate cancer by [CONTACT_9256], as did 6.2% of men with PSA levels<1.5ng/ml. In an era of increasing prostate cancer incidence and stage migration towards earlier disease, appropriate management of the disease requires assess ment of risk; how likely is a given man’s cancer to progress or 
metastasize over his remaining lifetime? What is the probability of success with treatment? What are the risks of side effects and complications with each treatment?   
Prostate cancer is relat ively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors estimated 
at [ADDRESS_808510] that 25 -30% of men undergoing radical 
prostatectomy have pathologic features in the radical prostatectomy specimen consistent with an insignificant or “indolent” cancer that posed little threat to life or health (organ -
confined cancer < 0.5cc, no Gleason grade 4 or 5 component). However, the biological potential of histologically detectable cancers is difficult to characterize with certainty, and a traditional 10 to 12 core transrectal prostate biopsy may underestimate the extent of 
cancer in the prostate in up to 50% of men with low -risk cancer. With alternative risk -
assessment strategies (including extended or mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609788]) some men have focal cancers that would not warrant complete gland treatment with radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy or external beam radiation therapy. While deferring 
definitive therapy (active surveillance) until progression of disease is an option in patients with low-risk and some with intermediate  cancer, some men with a diagnosis of “cance r” 
do not accept this approach, As such there appears to be a role for therapy solely targeting the cancer (focal therapy; the male “lumpectomy”). This has the theoretical advantage of treating/curing the cancer while at the same time having fewer side eff ects 
than traditional whole- gland treatments.   
The mechanism of action of bipolar RFA is complex. It has been proposed that RFA exerts its efficacious effect by: (1) the induction of protein denaturation by [CONTACT_609808] (2) the rupture of cell membranes from heating, (3) the transfer of water from intracellular to extracellular spaces, (4) vascular stasis, and (5) the induced apoptosis. The introduction of ultrasound guidance and the bi -polar design of the probe, 
allowed the heating process to be controlled and monitored in real time.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
 
This protocol will investigate the role of focal bipolar RFA in a defined prostate cancer population examining treatment efficacy (elimination of the cancer) based on repeat biopsy at six months from treatment.  
 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  Changes from baseline in quality- of-life. 
2.  Image characteristics of treated prostate cancer by [CONTACT_609807]  
3.  To evaluate the safety of the procedure  TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:  Evaluate the health economic impact of focal RFA.  
 
OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION        
 
1.1 Design  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_609789] (primary endpoint) and quality -of-life 
changes, safety, and image characteristics by [CONTACT_9268] (secondary endpoint) in men with unilateral prostate cancer treated with focal RFA. In addition, the study will 
collect me dical resource utilization data to assess the health economic impact of 
focal RFA (tertiary endpoint). We estimated the negative biopsy rate at 6 months 
after focal bipolar RFA is greater than or equal to 90%.  
 
1.2 Intervention  
 
Before any study procedures are performed (which includes all screening procedures, pre- treatment, treatment/intervention procedures, etc.), all patients will 
be asked to sign an informed consent form.  
 
Eligible patients will have been diagnosed with unilateral prostate cancer, with P SA <10, 
Gleason score 6 or 7, up to clinical stage T2a, and prostate volume<60 cc. At enrollment, 
patients will undergo 1.5T MRI with DCE and DWI imaging. The prostate is divided into four regions: RIGHT CENTRAL, RIGHT PERIPHERAL, LEFT CENTRAL and LEFT PERIPHERAL. Then they will undergo a pre -treatment transrectal mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609790]. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia as an outpatient procedure. For study purposes, the prostate biopsy cores will be obtained from four regions: RIGHT CENTRAL, RIGHT PERIPHERAL, 
LEFT CENTRAL and LEFT PERIPHERAL. For patients to be eligible for treatment with focal bipolar RFA under this protocol they must meet the original entry criteria on this pre-treatment mappi [INVESTIGATOR_95522]. 
 Those men meeting the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -biopsy criteria will subsequently be treated with focal 
bipolar RFA. Treatment is performed under general anesthesia and will include the regions of the prostate containing cancer based on the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_95522]. If there are multiple unilateral areas of the prostate involved with cancer, a hemi -ablation will be

MCC #[ZIP_CODE]  Protocol Version 7/ October 12, [ADDRESS_808511] quality -of-life questionnaires. For those patients not enrolled on this 
study protocol, their data from completion of the quality -of-life questionnaires will not be 
included in this investigation.  Any adverse events that occur as a result of this study will be recorded and reported to the regulatory committees at Moffitt and IRB.   If after the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609791], he will be 
excluded from this study protocol but considered and offered other management options for prostate cancer including active surveillance, radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. 
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:  
Criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_178144]:  
1. If at the second mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609792] [ADDRESS_808512] a positive biopsy in the ablated area, the study will be stopped.  This is based on the current treatment failure rate of 20% for radical prostatectomy. 
2. If even one patient develops hematuria after the procedure requiring a second procedure to be performed, the study will be terminated. 
3. If even one patient requires a Foley catheter for greater than 2 weeks following 
the procedure, the study will be terminated.  
4. If even one patient develops an infection requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the study will be terminated.  
5. If even one patient develops a rectal fistula the study will be terminated.

 3.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS   
 Before any study procedures are performed (which includes all screening procedures, pre- treatment, treatment/intervention procedures, etc.), all patients will 
be asked to sign an informed consent form.  
 
3.1  Imaging  
After the informed consent is signed, the patient will be scheduled for an MRI (dynamic 
contrast enhanced and diffusion weighted imaging using a 1.5 Tesla endorectal MRI.  The regions where both imaging sets indicate the potential for disease will be identified and categorized to one or more of 4 possible regions of the prostate as defined below.  
  3.2  Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609793] -guided prostate biopsies will be performed to determine study 
eligibility as well as to assess treatment efficacy.  The two biopsy sess ions (one pre -
treatment and the other 6 months after focal RFA) will follow the same method. The rational for a complete mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609794], rather than just sampling of the regions that were treated, is to identify cancer lesions not found in initial MRI/biopsy (thus, not treated) or cancer that may have developed after RF treatment.  
 Preparation/anesthesia: The patient will be given a Fleet enema prior to the procedure and administered prophylactic antibiotics. With the patient in the lithotomy position and under general anesthesia, transperineal saturation biopsies are obtained and separated in four sections: RIGHT CENTRAL, RIGHT PERIPHERAL, LEFT CENTRAL and LEFT PERIPHERAL.   
 
3.3 Focal RFA of the Prostate  
 
The equipment for whole -gland RFA of the prostate is FDA cleared for clinically 
localized prostate cancer, and the focal RFA equipment is also commercially available. The focal RFA equipment used in this study is cleared for radiofrequency soft tissue ablation by [CONTACT_1622].    
Description of procedure use for the Focal RFA of the Prostate:  
The patient is given a Fleets enema prior to the procedure and administered prophylactic 
antibiotics. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis under general.  With the patient in the lithotomy position a Foley catheter is inserted into the bladder and the 
scrotum is elevated toward the abdomen either by [CONTACT_66597][INVESTIGATOR_609795] a rolled towel. Perineal shave is optional. The rectum is irrigated with normal saline to ensure a dequate bowel 
preparation. The perineum is prepared sterilely.   The bipolar RFA procedure is performed under transrectal ultrasound guidance.  Transrectal ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum.  The probe is then connected to a stepper stabilizer a nd the pelvis is visualized at 5mm steppi[INVESTIGATOR_609796] 
10 
 
MCC #[ZIP_CODE]  Protocol Version 7/ October 12, 2015 
prostate, urethra, bladder, seminal vesicles, and anterior rectal wall can all be appropriately visualized. The ultrasound images and probe driving mechanism template are mated to allow accurate position of the probe so as to precisely target the regions of the prostate that were mapped during the biopsy. The desired target will be defined by [CONTACT_609809].  An appropriate insertion location of the bipolar RFA probes are designed in the planning process to target the regions of the prostate to be ablated (the number of probes will depend upon the size/shape of the prostate and the location of the lesions to be ablated.   Designated regions of the prostate will be ablated via the ENCAGE™ (Trod Medical® 
Bradenton, FL) RFA  system.  ENCAGE™  has FDA clearance for percutaneous RF soft 
tissue / tumor ablation.  The system consists of percutaneous probes connected to a RF 
bipolar generator which precisely controls the ablation.  Once the target areas for ablation have been identified on TRUS the  ENCAGE™ RFA probe will be inserted 
percutaneously through the skin of the perineum into the prostate under ultrasound guidance.  Once the probe is positioned containing the prostate region designated for 
ablation, ablation will be initiated.  RFA will occur at 0.5 cm increments along the 
longitudinal axis of the prostate under ultrasound guidance initiating cranially towards the prostate base and moving caudally towards the apex.  The number of probes inserted percutaneously into the prostate  will be predefined based on the target size and shape.  
Only one probe will be inserted at any time with prior probes removed before ins erting 
the next.  Once ablation has been completed the prostate and bladder neck will be surveyed with the TRUS.  The TRUS probe will then be removed from the rectum and the Foley catheter will be deflated and removed from the bladder.  
 
3.4 Assessment of Quality -of-Life  
 Assessment of quality of life (via completion of the questionnaires) will correlate with AUA symptom score, RAS, IIEF -15, and EPIC QOL.  
 Medical Resource Utilization  
 Medical resource utilization (MRU) will be recorded weekly through patient self -
report using a patient MRU diary. These MRU data will allow for a health economic evaluation of the ENCAGE
TM technology.

4.3    Inclusion of Women and Minorities :  All participants will be men without 
previous treatment for prostate cancer.   Men of all ethnic groups and races are eligible for the study. Thus women will not be included in this study.  
  
 4.4 Recruitment Plan  
 
Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient’s treatment team, the protocol investiga tor, or research team at H. L. Moffitt Cancer Center. If the 
investigator is a member of the treatment team, he/she will screen their patient’s medical records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study and their potential for enrolling  in the research study. Potential subjects contact[CONTACT_609810]/research staff of the study.  
 The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_609797] a trea tment relationship with, for the limited purpose of identifying 
patients who are eligible to enroll in the study and to record appropriate contact [CONTACT_609811].   
During the initial conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the 
patient may be asked to provide certain health information that is necessary to the recruitment and enrollment process. The investigator/research staff may also review portions of their medical records at H. L. Moffitt Cancer Center  in order to further assess 
eligibility. They will use the information provided by [CONTACT_5363] /or medical record to confirm that the patient is eligible and to contact [CONTACT_609812] g study 
enrollment. If the patient turns out to be ineligible for the research study, the research staff will destroy all information collected on the patient during the initial conversation 
12 
 
MCC #[ZIP_CODE]  Protocol Version 7/ October 12, [ADDRESS_808515] will be conducted either by [CONTACT_77310], investigator or the research staff working in consultation with the treatment team. The recruitment process outlined presents no more than minimal risk to 
the privacy of the patients who are screened and minimal patient health information (PHI) will be maintained as part of a screening log.  
 
 5.0 PRE- TREATMENT EVALUATION AND IMAGING  
 
The pre-enrollment clinical evaluation will include a complete medical history, physical 
examination including digital rectal examination, review of prostate biopsy information including Gleason score, review of any imaging studies, and clinical staging (T NM 
staging). Patients with up to clinical stage T2a prostate cancer meeting the aforementioned clinical and biopsy criteria are eligible for enrollment. If the patient had their diagnostic biopsy performed at an outside institution, these biopsy slides mus t be 
reviewed at our center prior to determining patient eligibility. If there is a discrepancy between the outside and H. L. Moffitt Cancer Center  pathology reviews, we will rely on 
the H. L. Moffitt Cancer Center  review to determine eligibility.  
Baseline visit: determine patient eligibility. If patient’s diagnostic prostate biopsy has not 
yet been reviewed at pathology, a request will be made to have pathology review the slides and provide a review for diagnosis. Once eligibility is confirmed and patient agrees 
to participate in the study an informed consent is signed. Pre -mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609798] #1 (week 0 to 12): After the informed consent is signed, the patient will be scheduled for an MRI (DCE and DWI using a 1.5T MRI if possible with a Sentinal Endorectal coil).  The regions where both imaging sets indicate the potential for 
disease will be identified.  During the initial transrectal- guided mappi[INVESTIGATOR_95523], 
all acquired ultrasound images will be registered to the MRI images. Baseline laboratory studies including serum electrolytes, UA, PT/PTT/INR, CBC, electrocardiogram and chest xray will be performed on patients prior to the procedure. A consent (separate from the informed consent to participate in the study) for the biopsy procedure will be obtained per the Cancer Center’s policy for any procedure conducted for treatment/diagnosis.    
Patients will also be asked to complete an assessment (see appendixes A -D) of urinary, 
sexual and bowel functioning, as well as overall quality of life, at baseline.  These 
assessments will be completed at the beginning of the study and at 6 months after the RFA procedure during their clinic visit.  
6.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
Before any study procedures are performed (which includes all screening 
procedures, pre- treatment, treatment/intervention procedures, etc.), all patients will 
be asked to sign an informed consent form.  
Prior to the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_95523], patients will be required to have an EKG and Chest X-Ray.
 Eligible patients are evaluate d with a transrectal -guided transperineal mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
13 
 
MCC #[ZIP_CODE]  Protocol Version 7/ October 12, 2015 
prostate biopsy. Patients meeting our definition of low -risk or intermediate prostate 
cancer (up to clinical stage T2a, PSA< 10ng/ml,  Gleasons score 6 or 7 ), will undergo 
RFA of the regions containing cancer on the mappi[INVESTIGATOR_95522] (focal bipolar RFA). Six months following focal bipolar RFA the patient will undergo a second mappi[INVESTIGATOR_95522]. 
 
7.0 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION   
Before any study procedures are performed (which includes all screening 
procedures, pre- treatment, treatment/intervention procedures, etc.), all patients will 
be asked to sign an informed consent form.  
Focal bipolar RFA will be done (after 4 weeks and no more than 12 weeks of initial mappi[INVESTIGATOR_95522]): a separate informed consent  for this procedure will be obtained (which 
is separate from the informed consent to participate in the study), per the Cancer Center’s policy for any procedure conducted for treatment/diagnosis.  If the laboratory studies obtained at the pre -mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609799] y assessment are still valid  (within 6 months), they will 
not be repeated.  
Six weeks after focal bipolar RFA; DRE, PSA, assessment of toxicity will be done . 
Toxicity of transperineal prostate biopsy includes  bleeding, infection, urinary retention. 
Toxicity of focal bipolar RFA includes bleeding, infection, urinary incontinence, urinary 
retention, erectile dysfunction, urinary urgency, urinary frequency and rectal fistula. Three months after focal RFA; DRE, PSA, assessment of toxicity will be done as 
mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 
 Six months after focal bipolar RFA; DRE, PSA, QOL questionnaire, assessment of toxicity; obtain serum electrolytes, UA, EKG and chest x- ray in preparation for repeat 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_609800]. The patient will be scheduled for the second MRI imaging and transrectal -guided mappi[INVESTIGATOR_95523] # [ADDRESS_808516] a patient follow up in 1-
2 weeks for discussion of results and assessment of a ny adverse events (this will be the 
end of study visit).   
 Patients will record weekly medical resource utilization data to share with their study 
coordinator at routine scheduled visits.

MCC #[ZIP_CODE]  Protocol Version 7/ October 12, 2015 
11.0 Statistical Consideration  
 
11.1 Study Design/Endpoints   
 
This is a prospective study. The primary endpoint is safety of the procedure negative prostate biopsy rate at six months. The secondary endpoint is quality of life and safety of the procedure.  
 
11.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_609802], the negative biopsy rate at 6 months after focal bipolar RFA. We estimated the negative biopsy rate at 6 months after focal bipolar RFA is greater than or equal to 90%. If the negative biopsy rate at the 6- month visit is 
90%, a sample size of 20 patients provides a two-sided 95% confidence interval of 68.3-98.8%. If the negative biopsy rate at the 6 -month visit is 95%, the 95% corresponding 
confidence interval is 75.1-99.9%. Thus, the total sample size for this study will be 20 patients. We estimate an accrual rate of 4 patients a month. We anticipate completion of 
this study over a one year time period.    
11.3 Stratification Factors   
No stratification factors will be applied.  
 
  
11.4 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics  collected at each visit. Mean, standard deviation and range will be 
calculated for continuous variables, and frequency and percentage will be generated for categorical variables. The primary objective is to assess the local oncologic efficacy of focal RFA  in men with low -risk prostate cancer. The primary efficacy endpoint is 
negative biopsy rate at 6 months after focal bipolar RFA. The point estimate and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the exact binominal method.   
11.5 Analysis of Sec ondary Endpoints  
 
The secondary objective is to evaluate the change from baseline in quality -of-life 
indicators following focal RFA in patients with low -risk localized prostate cancer. The 
patients will complete the EPIC, AUA, RAS, and IIEF-5 questionnaire s at baseline, 3 - 
and 6-month visit. The QOL will be primarily based on the EPIC, developed to measure health related quality of life among men with prostate cancer. The EPIC assesses the disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapi[INVESTIGATOR_609803] (Urinary, Bowel, Sexual and Hormonal) [Wei et al, 2000]. The EPIC summary score and subscale characteristics at each time- point will be calculated based on its 
scoring instruction ( http://roadrunner.cancer.med.umich.edu/epic/epi[INVESTIGATOR_533043].html
). The 
summary score of the AUA, RAS and IIEF-5 questionnaires will be also calculated. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation and inter -quartile range) will be

Patients will collect weekly data on health care visits including clinician seen, indication for visit and any procedures associated with the visit. Descriptive statistics will summarize the frequency of visits by [CONTACT_609813].   Cost values will be assigned to health care visits based on the indication and procedures/evaluations completed as a part of the visit. These costs will be assigned throughout the [ADDRESS_808519] be obtained before the eligibility confirmation and obtaining of the research inf ormed consent. 
 Confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility.  
 Obtain written informed consent from each patient

13.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
The clinical research nurse/study coordinator responsibilities  include: project compliance, 
data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of the protocol study team. 
The data collected for this study will be entered into a secure database at Biomed . Source 
documentation will be available to support the computerized patient record. 
13.[ADDRESS_808520] keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
 
13.2  Data monitoring and sponsor C RFs collection will be 
performed by [CONTACT_609814]. The clinical data for this protocol will be recorded on patient Case Report Forms (CRF’s) printed on 3-part NCR and bound into individual patient booklets. Once all da ta queries are resolved for a given 
data form, the white copy will go to the sponsor (Trod), the yellow copy will go to MCC data management, and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_609804]. Biomed will monitor conformance to the protocol informed consent, AE’s, etc. as well as verify random CRF’s to source documents and work with MCC to resolve data queries. Biomed will be responsible to collect the sponsor’s copy (white) of the completed/verified/signed CRF’s, but Biomed will not retain sponsor CRF’s.  
13.2.1 Identifying patient information will be kept confidential. CRF’s will not contain the patient’s MRN, name, etc. only, a “Subject Record ID No (3 digits) ” and “Subject Initials”  (F, M, L). The 
Clinical Research Nurse/Coordinator at Moffitt will maintain 
the “key” that links patients  (with their name, MRN, etc.) to 
their “Subject Record No.” The “key” will be destroyed upon completion of data analysis for this study. 
Identifying patient 
information will be kept co nfidential. All direct identifying 
(name, medial record number, etc.) will be destroyed and 
removed from the computer upon completion of data analysis for this study.

13.2.2   Representatives of the IRB, OHRP , Moffitt Committees  and 
Center for Medicare and  Medicaid Services (CMS)  will have 
access to patient information as it pertains to the study.  
13.2.3    Privacy and confidentiality of the information will be protected to the extent provided by [CONTACT_67204].  
13.2.4    The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_609805] l Research 
Nurse/Coordinator assigned to the study protocol will be primarily responsible for maintaining all study related documents including the clinical research forms, as well as for providing the sponsor with its copy of each completed CRF.  All data collection will be performed on hard- copy (3-part 
NCR) CRF’s.  The review of medical records  (by [CONTACT_609815]) within the Cancer Center’s institutional 
database will be done in a manner to assure that patient confidentiality (PHI) is protected and maintained at all times.  
 
14. ETHICS/ HUMAN SUBJECT’S PROTECTION  
 
14.1 Patient Consent:   Patients who are candidates for this study at Moffitt Cancer 
Center will be approached for this study.  Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be consented using the IRB approved consent form.  The consent will be verbally explained to the partic ipant by a member of the research team, describing the study 
procedures, risks, benefits, etc.  Patients must be freely consenting adults.  Patients who meet eligibility criteria and provide informed consent as documented by a signed consent form by [CONTACT_609816].  All subjects interested in participating in this study will be given a copy of the informed consent form to read and sign. Each subject who is interested in participating in this s tudy will be asked to sign and date the IRB approved consent 
form. All discussions related to participating in this study and obtaining informed consent will take place in a private room in the clinic at Moffitt to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of each subject is protected. Only members of the research team will be involved in this process and have access to the signed consent forms. All signed consent forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet.  14.2 Regulatory Approval:   The trial will be appr oved by [CONTACT_36552] H. Lee Moffitt 
Cancer Center and Research Institute’s Scientific Review Committee (SRC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB).   14.3 Protocol Modifications:   No modifications will be made to the protocol and 
implemented without the agr eement of the investigators and approval from the 
Moffitt Scientific Review Committee (SRC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Changes that significantly affect the safety of the patients, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study will require approval from the SRC and IRB prior to implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Any departures from the protocol will be documented in the case report form and the source documentation and reported the SRC and IRB.

 14.4 Potential Risks: There are risks associating with having any type 
of surgery.  The surgery team will explain these risks to the potential participants and inform them they will be asked to sign a separate 
consent form for the standard of care treatment and if they agree to participate, an informed consent to participate in this research study. These risks include bleeding, infection, urinary incontinence, risk of anesthesia related complicat ions, urinary retention, erectile 
dysfunction, urinary urgency, frequency and rectal fistula. There are also psychological risks associated with completing the quality of life questionnaires. 
 
 As with any research study, there is always a potential risk of unintentional 
disclosure of protected personal health information (PHI); however, every precaution will be taken to ensure all PHI and data collected as part of this study is kept confidential.  All data will be kept confidential.    
 
14.5: Potential Bene fits: Participants will not directly benefit for taking part in this 
study.  We hope that the results of this study will someday benefit future patients with prostate cancer.  
  
14.6: Payment and Costs:    
 
14.6.1: Payment 
Participants will not be paid to participate in this study.   
 
14.6.2: Costs to Participate 
There will be no extra cost to patients as a result of participating in this study.  
Costs of standard medical care for RFA, including all costs of the surgery, lab work, etc. will be charged to the patient and/or their insurance company.  
Participants and /or their insurance company will be financially responsible for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139265], outpatient and follow -up visits that would normally or routinely 
occur in the management of their disease. Inpatient and outpatient visits could include 
charges for treatments, medications, physician visits, laboratory tests and procedures. 
Participants and /or their insurance company will be responsible for paying for the charges which are considered routine, since they would have received these services even if they were n ot participating in this study. Participants will be responsible for 
any costs not covered by [CONTACT_609817], including deductibles, co-payments and all out -of-pocket expenses. Participants and/or their insurance company 
will not be responsible for paying for the following testing and procedures that are specifically required for this research study and are not considered part of the routine management of their disease, if these procedures are performed at Moffitt Cancer Center.

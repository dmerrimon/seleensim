SPONSOR  Ray Co., Ltd.  
DEVICE MANUFACTURER  Ray Co., Ltd . 
RATIONALE  Current radiologic imaging modalities used in dentistry provide information 
on the morphology of the hard tissues. Additional information on the 
density of bone has practical relevance, for example, in dental implant 
treatment planning, where local bone quality is a known st rong predictor of 
successful implant osseointegration.  The Dual -Energy Cone Beam 
Computed Tomography (DE -CBCT) device is designed to overcome 
limitations of traditional imaging and will provide assessment  of jaw bone  
density  in additional to  morphological information.  
This clinical trial will examine the application of DE -CBCT to assess jaw  bone 
density and compare Hounsfield units ( HU) values with multidetector CT , 
an established standard for assessing B D.

density. Information on the jaw bone  density has practical relevance , for example, in dental implant 
treatment planning, where local bone quality is a known strong predictor of successful implant

The Dual -Energy Cone Beam Computed Tomography (DE -CBCT) device is designed to overcome

density and compare th is novel device with multidetector computed  tomography (MDCT) . 
 
2.2 Background and Significance  
Computed tomography (CT)  is an x -ray-based imaging technique that produces cross -sectional images 
of the body. In all CT techniques, a collimated x -ray source and a detector revolve around the patient. 
The d etector records photon attenuation by [CONTACT_206029], 
registering this information at several hundred angles through the rotational arc. Complex mathematical 
algorithms translate this attenuation data into a three -dimensional (3D) map that spatially locates the 
attenuating structures.[ADDRESS_245702], multiple rows of detectors 
are incorporated into the array in the z-axis (craniocaudal axis, patient’s head to foot), allowing capture 
of multiple image slices during each gantry revoluti on. Current detector spatial resolution allows 
imaging of submillimeter dimensions. Volumetric acquisition with isotropic imaging allows reformatting 
in planes different from the axial acquisition, without compromising image quality. Contemporary MDCT 
scan ners have [ADDRESS_245703] volume is represented by a numerical gray value ( CT 
number). [ADDRESS_245704] number include the tissue 
features (atomic number and density) and homogeneity and energy of the x -ray beam. CT numbers are 
expressed as Hounsfield units (HU), which expresses x -ray attenuation of a voxel re lative to the 
attenuation of water. In the HU scale, the CT number 
of water is defined as zero, and the CT number of air 
is defined as −1000. The HU values of ~ 200 and 
higher represent densities of trabecular and cortical 
bone.   

Mallya S. M  
Version 1. 1  Version Date: 16_NOV_2020   Page [ADDRESS_245705] and HU:  Assess ment of BD has relevance in dentistry. T he degree of mineralization of bone at 
dental implant sites are strong determinants of implant osseointegration and stability. Likewise, closer 
representation of attenuation and CT numbers are important for third party ap plications of CT data that 
use automatic segmentation for computer -aided design and computer -aided manufacturing 
applications. Current dental CBCT units do not apply a  standard scaling system for representing CT 
numbers , and a ttempts  to convert CBCT number s to HU  are unsuccessful . In particular, the cone beam 
geometry of the x -ray beam produces scatter radiation and consequently decrease the signal -to-noise 
ratio , with a practical negative impact on contrast resolution of the CBCT image.[ADDRESS_245706] imaging uses a poly -energetic x -ray beam, with peak energies typi[INVESTIGATOR_4942] 
90kVp to 110kVp. Attenuation of the x -ray photons is a function of the absorber’s atomic number and 
the energy of the incident photons, and the resultan t gray value in an image pi[INVESTIGATOR_206017]. As described above, factors include scatter radiation and reconstruction 
algorithms impact the accuracy of the true attenuation. In DE -CBCT, attenuation data is assessed  using 
two x-ray sources with different energy spectra. Following acquisition at both energies, mathematical 
algorithms are applied to compare attenuation between the two energies, and to translate this 
information into better estimates of bone mineral density. Thus , DE-CBCT provides an approach to 
assess both morphology and the chemical composition of bone. The proposed study will examine a new 
CT device, a DE -CBCT unit to provide additional valuable information on bone density, a factor that 
impact s surgical techni que and successful osseointegration.  
 
Practical Applications of BD assess ment  in dental implant treatment planning : CBCT imaging is widely 
used  to evaluate edentulous sites for potential dental implant placement. Assessment of bone quantity 
and quality at the potential implant site is an essential objective of imaging. Bone quantity refers to the 
height and width of the residual alveolar bone. Bo ne quality represents  the thickness of cortical bone, 
the abundance of trabecular bone, and the overall degree of mineralization .14 In particular, l ocal quality 
of bone is a key fa ctor that influences successful osseointegration. The Lekholm and Zarb classification16 
is widely used to categorize bone quantity and quality  for implant placement . This classification scheme 
continues to be used in clinical practice and is recorded as the subjective perception during drilling prior 
to implant plac ement. In this classification b one quality is categorized into four types:  
Type 1: P redominantly cortical bone  
Type II: C entral core of dense trabecular bone surrounded by a thick layer of cortical bone  
Type III: A thin layer of cortical bone surrounding dense trabecular bone  
Type IV: A t hin layer of cortical bone that surrounds low density trabecular bone

2.3 Risk-Benefit Assessment  
2.3.1 Known potential risks  
The risks from this study are related to radiation exposure. Subjects in this study will receive two x -ray 
examinations:  
(a) MDCT, Maxillo facial, without contrast, Standard treatment, CPT [ZIP_CODE]:  The MDCT exam is acquired 
as standard treatment protocol for dental treatment planning.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_206018] (Dose -area product, 
DAP ) for CT examination of head is 35,000 -48,000 mGy •cm2. 20 
(b) DE-CBCT, Investigational device:  The radiation dose (DAP ) is approximately 883 mGy•cm2. Overall, 
the doses from DE -CBCT are low to negligible. Compared with MDCT , the radiation dose from DE -
CBCT is approximately one fiftieth (2%).  
 
The radiation doses are orders of magnitude below threshold doses needed to cause deterministic 
effects. Thus, we do not expect any immediate risks from radiation exposure .  
The only potential risks of this added radiation are long -term risk of radiation indu ced cancer. As 
described above , the radiation doses delivered by [CONTACT_206030] -CBCT device are several -fold lower than 
diagnostic CT scans, indicating that these risks are much lower than risks of current diagnostic imaging 
procedures.

The basic premise of this study is that the investigational device  (DE-CBCT)  will provide accurate 
estimates of BD in the dento -alveolar bone. The accuracy of DE -CBCT assess ments will be determined 
against the clinical gold standard for BD assessment . The outcome of this study will demonstrate the 
efficacy and accuracy of DE -CBCT to assess  BD at jaw sites.

5 STUDY POPULATION  
5.1 Rationale for Number of Subjects  
Based  on the reference paper called “Bone quality evaluation at dental implant site using multislice CT, 
micro -CT, and cone beam CT,” the correlation coefficient of human mandibular bone density (HU) 
between CBCT and M DCT was observed to be 0.89. In assumption that there also exists a correlation 
between the HU values of DE -CBCT images and MDCT images, Pearson’s correlation analysis was 
considered for calculating the appropriate number of patients for the current study.  
With  0.05 Type 1 Error (significance leve l 5%)  and 80% statistical power, the number of patients is 
calculated to be 7. Further consid ering the three age groups and 1 0% of dropout r ate will result in a 
total of 24  patients to be enrolled in the study.

5.[ADDRESS_245717] screen failures. Screen failures could occur i f a patient decides to revoke 
informed consent or provides additional data that changes eligibility assessment. In such cases , we will 
document relevant information including the reason for screen failure, and the specific criteria that are 
unmet.  
As per the American College of Radiology practice parameters for imaging pregnant patients19, 
diagnostic examinations of the head and neck do NOT require verification of pregnancy status, because 
Mallya S. M  
Version 1. 1  Version Date: 16_NOV_2020   Page 20 of 37 they do not directly expose the pelvic/abdominal area, and the scattered dose to the embryo/fetus is 
negligible. Nevertheless, pregnant patie nts are excluded from this study, following a markedly 
conservative approach to radiation safety.  
Verification of pregnancy status will be via  clinical history and is often  sufficient for this examination. For 
example, w omen may  attest that they cannot reasonably be pregnant , are between regular menstrual 
periods , or are on long -term birth control . From a scientific viewpoint, uncertainty regarding pregnancy 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_206019]. Given the low radiation doses, the likelihood of eff ects on the 
embryo -fetus are negligible.  
 
5.6  Strategies for recruitment  
• The study will recruit subjects who are seeking dental treatment at the UCLA Dental Center.  
• The target population is patients , 21 years  and older .  
• In this study, we will aim for an app roximately equal gender distribution  in the three age groups .  
• Potential participants will be identified via the UCLA Dental Center Clinics, and participation 
opportunity will be publicized at these clinics and to relevant providers of dental treatment at the 
UCLA Dental Clinic via electronic and paper communication.   
• Vulnerable populations are NOT  a target of this recruitment . 
• The subject will receive the standard of care MDCT scan at no charge, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a $ [ADDRESS_245718] scan will be done at no charge.  
• Participants will be reimbursed for parking at the UCLA School of Dentistry (Visit 1) and the UCLA

DISCONTINUATION/ WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 Discontinuation of study intervention  
The intervention (patient imaging) occurs in one  visit. The only reason to not do the patient imaging 
would be new information that changes the inclusion/exclusion. The study team will document relevant 
infor mation including demographics, reason for discontinuance, and the specific criteria that are unmet. 
Since the study is a single imaging intervention, discontinuance from the study has no impact on the 
patient’s safety or well -being and requires no further action from the study team.  
 
7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
• Pregnancy  
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• Development of new  condition s that would change inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognize d) that precludes further study participation  
• Participant unable to receive CT for 30 days . 
 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case 
Report Form (CRF).  
 
7.[ADDRESS_245723] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit : 
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_206040],  and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or sh ould continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls , within a 1 -week 
span ). These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s study file.  
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from 
the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 
 
[ADDRESS_245724] in identifying potential patients for screening. During the 
Mallya S. M  
Version 1. 1  Version Date: 16_NOV_2020   Page 29 of 37 screening visit, the research team  will confirm eligibility via the inclusion and exclu sion criteria and  
explain the risks of the study to the patients.  
 
Enrollment (Day 0)  
1. Patients that are cleared through the screening eligibility and who voluntarily sign the informed 
consent will be enrolled into the study. The patient will be cleared through the screening eligibility 
based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If not suitable for the enrollment, the reason will be 
recorded on the Case Report Form.  
 
2. An imaging stent will be created for the scanning . This stent, fabricated by [CONTACT_206041], bears 
radiopaque markers to provide location information on the CT scan, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_206023]. Patients will be scheduled for the CT scan by [CONTACT_5051], in 
coordination with the surgical team.  
 
Study Proc edure: DE-CBCT scan (Visit 1)  
1. Patients scheduled for their imaging procedures will be confirmed by [CONTACT_206042].  
 
2. For women in childbearing age, pregnancy status will be confirmed and recorded.  
 
3. The region of interest (example: tooth number, potential implant site ) that requires radiographic 
imaging  will be recorded.  
 
4. DE-CBCT: Prior to imaging, the DE -CBCT unit will be calibrated using a hydroxyapatite (HA) standard 
phantom. Calibration is performed by [CONTACT_206043] 60 kV / 90 kV. The device will be calibrated three times throughout the study period - prior to the 
initiation of the study , half the number of patients are recruited, before the end of the study.  
 
⚫ The details of the HA phantom are as follows:  
- Manufacturer: QRM GmbH, [LOCATION_013]  
- Material: CaHP (Calcium Hydroxy Apatite)  
- HA Concentration (mg/cm3): 0, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200  
- Calibration protocol: ISO [ADDRESS_245725]  imaging . Either mandible or 
maxilla , depending on the tooth number (imaging site) , will be imaged. The appropriate imaging 
mode will be selected depending on patient size and field of view, and the tube energy set at 60 kV / 
[ADDRESS_245726] scan  (Visit 2) . The next  visit must be w ithin 30days after the visit

events such as  nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and oral inflammation occur.  
 
 
 
Mallya S. M  
Version 1. 1  Version Date: 16_NOV_2020   Page 30 of 37 Study Procedure: MDCT scan (Visit 2)  
1. Patients scheduled for their MDCT imaging procedures will be confirmed by [CONTACT_206044] . 
2. For women in childbearing age, pregnancy status will be re-confirmed and recorded.  
3. The region of interest (example: tooth numbe r, potential implant site) that requires radiographic 
imaging will be recorded. The imaging site for MDCT scan will be identical to the one for DE -CBCT 
scan.  
4. The patient will be imaged using the  standard clinical protocol for MDCT , and simultaneous sca nning 
of the calibration phantom (QRM -BDC/6) . 
 
8.2 Efficacy assessments  
BD Assess ment  
In each patient’s  MDCT and DE -CBCT scans , discrete regions of interest (ROIs) will be made in the area  
where radiographic imaging is necessary for the dental diagnosis and treatment plan. The ROI will be 
angulated, sized, and positioned to mark the  treatment area . Using the software tools, the B D will be 
assessed and recorded.  The assess ments at each location will be recorded and the HU values of  DE-CBCT  
will be correlated with those of MDCT . 
Assess ments will be made independently by [CONTACT_206045].  Each radiologist will 
make these assessments twice, with at least  one month between the two assessments . 
 
8.[ADDRESS_245728] examination is from ionizing radiation. With the low 
dose used in this procedure, we do not anticipate any deterministic radiation -related effects. The lack of 
such events will be documented after each examination.  
 
8.4 Adverse events and serious adverse events  
8.4.1 Definition of adverse event  
An Adverse Event (AE) in this clinical trial includes any unfavorable and unintended signs, or symptoms 
associated wit h the use of DE -CBCT and CBCT , whether or not considered intervention related .  
AE may be expected (ex : symptoms related to deterministic radiation e ffects ) or unexpected. 
Unexpected AE is a sign or symptom not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity than expected based on the information in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
8.4.2 Serious adverse event  
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of eithe r the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgme nt, 
they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
8.4.3 Classification of an adverse event  
Severity of event  
Mallya S. M  
Version 1. 1  Version Date: 16_NOV_2020   Page 31 of 37 • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with func tioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equ ate to “serious”.  
 
Relationship to study intervention  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical judgm ent. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect.  
 
Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention 
and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the study intervention and the AE.  
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or 
an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
Expectedness  
The Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_206024] -Investigators will be responsible for determining 
whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of th e event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study intervention.  
 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
8.4.4  Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appr opriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Mallya S. M  
Version 1. 1  Version Date: 16_NOV_2020   Page [ADDRESS_245729] all reportable events with start dates occ urring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Eve nts will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.4.5  Adverse event reporting  
The PI/designee will record non -serious adverse events and report them to project sponsor within [ADDRESS_245730] (IRB) as soon as possible, but in no event 
later t han [ADDRESS_245731] and shall report the 
results of such evaluation to the Food and Drug Administrat ion (FDA) and to all reviewing IRBs and 
participating investigators within [ADDRESS_245732], we will analyze the agreement 
between the two methods using Bland -Altman plots.  
 
To evaluate the intra - and inter -observer reliability, observer we will use Kappa statistics to:  
1. Quantify the  level of agreement between duplicate assess ments by [CONTACT_206046]  
2. Quantify the level of agreement between independent assess ments by [CONTACT_206047], the data from PP analysis group (Per -Proto col Analysis Set) will be analyzed.  
 
Mallya S. M  
Version 1. 1  Version Date: 16_NOV_2020   Page 33 of 37 ① Per Protocol Analysis Set:  
The PP analysis group includes subjects who complete the study  according to the study plan without a 
signifi cant violation of the protocol - from voluntarily agreeing to participate in the study to finishing the 
scanning of both DE -CBCT and MDCT. If the quality of image is affected by [CONTACT_206048] , the 
subject corresponding to  the image is excluded from t he PP analysis group.  
 
② A major violation of the study plan to be excluded from the PP analysis group:  
The quality of  the image, especially the area where  ROI is located, is degraded  by [CONTACT_206048] .

informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. 
The informed co nsent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the 
date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study -specific procedures. The rights 
and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_21223].  
 
10.1.2  Study discontinuation and closure  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_61188] <study participants, investigator, funding agency, 
the Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational De vice Exemption (IDE) sponsor and regulatory 
authorities>.  If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will 
promptly inform study participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide

be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the prima ry endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility

staff, and the sponsor(s) and their interventions. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of 
biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. 
Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in 
strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unautho rized 
third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.  
 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Data col lection and management responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the 
principal  investigator. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_19760], completeness, legibility, and 
timeli ness of the data reported.  
 
All source documents will be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data.  Data recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) derived from source documents will be 
consistent with the data recorded on the source docum ents.  
 
Clinical data (including adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions 
data) and clinical laboratory data will be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11 -compliant data capture system.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study records retention  
Study documents  will be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_245737] approval of a marketing 
application in an International Conference on Harminosation (ICH) region and until there are no pending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at le ast [ADDRESS_245738] elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study intervention. These documents may be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed 
without the written co nsent of the sponsor, if applicable. The sponsor will inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_206025].  
 
10.1.8  Protocol deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonisati on Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a 
result of deviations, corrective actions will be developed by t he site and implemented promptly.  
The study team will use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations within [ADDRESS_245739] (IRB).

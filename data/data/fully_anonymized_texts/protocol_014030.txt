Funded by: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] J Fox Foundation to Tao Xie. The current study is basically an extension 
study of our previous one ( IRB 13 -0566; Effects of the stimulation frequency of STN DBS on 
swallowing function in patients with Parkinson's disease) but with a longer follow -up period (at 
least 6 months) in more patients and a full evaluation in each visit of maximum 2 visits in som e 
patients.  
 
Study Period: August 15, 2015 -March  15, 2017  
 
 
Background & Rationale:  
 
Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves the levodopa  
responsive cardinal symptoms (bradykinesia, rigidity and resting tremor), and reduces motor 
fluctuation and dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson ’s disease (PD) 1-5. However,  DBS was 
less effective at improving the axial symptoms (postural instability, gait disorders such as 
freezing of gait (FOG), speech and swallowing dysfunction), or even could ma ke them worse 
over the course of [ADDRESS_266333] of the 60Hz stimulation on another 
axial symptom, dysphagia, in patients on bilateral STN DBS who had medication refractory 
FOG at 130Hz 20 (supported by [CONTACT_221768]). We found that 60Hz stimulation, compared to the traditional 130Hz, decreased not only the 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_221759] (MBS) test and swallowing difficulty by 
[CONTACT_221769], but also the medication refractory FOG (by [CONTACT_221770] -walk -sit test 
and FOG questionnaire), and axial symptom subscore and general parkinsonism  motor symptom 
UPDRS -III score 20. The beneficial effect of the 60Hz stimulation persisted during the [ADDRESS_266334] ication of the 
60Hz stimulation chronically and confidently to treat the medication refractory axial 
symptoms.  
 
So far, there was only one study showing persistent benefit of the 60Hz stimulation on FOG in 
85% of the [ADDRESS_266335] 4 months (111.5 days on average) in 
45 patien ts 24. Worth noting that none of these two studies was really studying FOG, as one of 
them had no FOG on exam and the other one was not assessing FOG. Besides, these two studies 
used 80Hz, instead 60Hz, stimulation. None of them studied swallowing function  either.  
 
According to our continuous observation since we published our study 20, all of our 5 out of 7 
patients who was on 60Hz simulation for 6 -week study period remains on 60Hz since then for 
Version 3, 01JUL2015   Page 3 of 7 its benefit on axial symptoms including FOG, over the period  of up to 14 months follow up so 
far, which indicates a sustained chronic benefits. The 2 of the 7  patients were not on 60Hz 
stimulation after the previous study because of slightly worsening of tremor in 1 of them, and 
skin infectio n after the battery replacement (unrelated to the study) in another one. A formal 
randomized double blind prospective cross -over study on the chronic benefit of the 60Hz 
stimulation over an extended period of at least 6 months, corrected for the potential carry -over 
effects on this crossover study (DBS off, 60Hz or 130Hz while all at medication on state) at the 
acute (visit 1) and chronic phase (visit 2), is needed to enhance the quality of the study, the 
evidence level and the level of the recommendation i n clinical applications to treat the axial 
symptoms which are refractory to usual DBS setting and medications with high morbidity and 
mortality of the PD.  
  
All Parkinson ’s disease patients who have had aspi[INVESTIGATOR_221760].  
 
This study is basically an extension study of our previous one (IRB 13 -0566; Effects of the 
stimulation frequency of STN DBS on swallowing function in patients with Parkinson's 
disease, with publication in reference 20) but with  a longer follow -up period (at least 6 months) 
in more patients and a full evaluation in each visit of maximum 2 visits in some patients.  
 
Hypothesis:   
The 60Hz stimulation would have persistent benefit in reducing the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], FOG, other 
axial and moto r symptoms in PD patients with bilateral STN DBS and medication refractory 
FOG at 130Hz stimulation over an extended period of at least months, even corrected for the 
potential carry -over effects between different test conditions.  
 
Innovation:   
This would be the first study on the chronic effect of the 60Hz stimulation on the dysphagia, 
FOG and other axial and motor symptoms in PD with bilateral STN DBS with medication 
refractory FOG at 130Hz stimulation.  
 
Significance:   
This study will provide a high evide nce level and clinical recommendation on the chronic effect 
of the 60Hz stimulation on the treatment of the axial symptoms, particularly dysphagia and 
FOG, which are refractory to usual DBS setting and medications and associated with high 
morbidity and mor tality in PD.  
 
Aims:   
Aim 1a: A study on the chronic effect (at least 6 months) of 60Hz stimulation on axial 
symptoms, including swallowing function and FOG, and parkinsonism to see whether the 
beneficial effect of 60Hz stimulation compared to 130Hz as rev ealed in our previous study 20, 
could be sustained in PD patients with bilateral STN DBS with medication refractory FOG at 
130Hz.  
 
Aim 1b: This study would also clarify the potential carry -over effect on stimulation (DBS 
60Hz, DBS 130Hz, and DBS off, 30 mi n apart) on acute and chronic phase of the study  to 
Version 3, 01JUL2015   Page 4 of 7 enhance the quality of the study, and the level of evidence and recommendation in clinical 
applications.  
 
Approach:   
Towards that aim, we will add [ADDRESS_266336] 14 patients enrolled for visit 1, as 2 of them might drop off (or being unable to be on 60Hz 
due to worsening tremor) bef ore visit 2 (estimated based on our previous study that 1 out of 7 
patients could not be on 60Hz due to worsening tremor 20). The previous [ADDRESS_266337] 12 months after the initial visit 1 once we get the IRB approval here.  
 
We will then combine the data from these 14 newly added patients with the previous 7 patients 
at visit 1 to make 21 patients to complete the visit 1, and 18 -20 (12 to 1 4 newly added patients 
plus previous 6) patients to complete a longer interval visit [ADDRESS_266338] 6 months apart.  
 
As our previous study20, it will still be a randomized double -blind prospective cross -over study 
with medication on state but with 6 -8 patie nts on each group of starting condition (60Hz vs 130Hz 
vs DBS off, 30 min apart) to allow us analyze the chronic effect and  potential carry -over effect 
of stimulation between different conditions to increase the level of evidence, with 80% power to 
detect  at least 25% difference at two -tail α level of  0.05, as estimated before 20. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_221761], difficulty in swallowing on questionnaire, FOG in SWS test and 
questionnaire, and axial subscore and UPDRS -III score will all be assessed accordingl y under 
each DBS conditions as we did in our previous study 20, at both visit [ADDRESS_266339] 6 
months apart. The study will be finished in 2 years.  
 
Specifically, all the study patients will sign a written consent after the IEB approval. The study 
will be conducted at the Parkinson ’s Disease and Movement Disorder Center  of  
Department of Neurology, Department of Radiology, Speech and Swallowing Section of 
Department of Surgery, and Center for Research Informatics at the University of Chicago from  
August  15, [ADDRESS_266340] positions and 
settings will all be recorded.  
 
During visit, each patient will receive 3 routine modified barium swallow (MBS) studies in a 
single day under 3  different DBS frequency conditions (bilateral DBS 130 Hz, DBS 60 Hz, or 
DBS off) with their usual DBS voltage, pulse width, contact [CONTACT_20998], and parkinsonian 
medication -on state regardless of the study stimulation frequency used. The study will be 
perform ed in a randomized and double -blind manner. The order of the DBS conditions will be 
assigned by [CONTACT_221771][INVESTIGATOR_221762] [ADDRESS_266341] material, and solids coated in barium paste. The exami nations 
will be recorded on the TIMS -DICOM digital medical recording system at high resolution of 30 
frames per second. Frame -by-frame analysis will be used to evaluate oral, pharyngeal, 
laryngeal, and cricopharyngeal function. For the purposes of this stu dy, special attention will be 
given to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Laryngeal penetration and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_221763] -Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_127353]. The frequency of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_221764] c ondition that generates a Penetration -Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_221765]. The swallowing questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_221772]26. The parkinsonian motor, axial, and tremor symptoms as reflected 
by [CONTACT_221773] ’s Disease Rating Scale, Part  III (UPDRS -III) score, axial subscore 
(including gait, stance, posture, postural stability, and  speech), and tremor subscore, 
respectively, and the FOG as reflected by a FOG questionnaire score,27 and stand -walk -sit 
(SWS) test on  FOG spell times and the time needed to finish the test (seconds) will also be 
assessed before the MBS study under each DBS condition. The patients will be on each DBS 
condition for at least [ADDRESS_266342] gait function (least FOG, which was 60 Hz for 
all of our previous patients) will be continued for at least 6 months for the newly enrolled 
patients.  
 
Analysis: Changes in measurements between the 60Hz and  130Hz will be analyzed using paired 
t-test, with swallowing function (objective MBS study and subjective swallowing questionnaire) 
and FOG (objective SWS study and subjective questionnaire) as primary outcomes, and the rest 
(UPDRS -III score, axial subscor e and tremor subscore) as the secondary outcomes in both acute 
visit1 and chronic visit 2 phase. Changes between other clinically relevant DBS conditions, 
including 60Hz vs DBS off, 130Hz vs DBS off, and 60Hz vs 60Hz follow -up (for >8 months on 
average) wi ll also be explored and similarly analyzed with Bonferroni correction. A two -tailed 
alpha level of 0.05 will be taken as statistically significant for the comparisons.  
 
Foreseeable difficulty or complications:   
We don ’t anticipate any difficulty in conduct ing this study, as we had a successful 
similar  study before 20, with IRB approval (University of Chicago). Medication 
refractory tremor could offset the 60Hz use as the tremor could be worse compared to 
130Hz. However, most of the patient with axial sympto ms has less tremor, and 
medication refractory tremor is even less. In the past, we had only [ADDRESS_266343] current study in order to 
get the important questions answered.  
 
Pregnant  woman, children or mentally retarded patients: None of them will be involved, as 
these advanced patients are all at the post -menopausal age. No children will be involved in

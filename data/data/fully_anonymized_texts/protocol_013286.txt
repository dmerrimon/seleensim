Design
Please provide a lay summary (written at 6th grade level) that includes a statement ab out the purpose and the general aims of t he research.
Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) is common following anterior cervi cal spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477]. Studies have documented persistent swall owing difficulty up to 
two years postoperatively. The long term objective is to change the treatment paradigm for cervical  spi[INVESTIGATOR_685723] d ysphagia and associated 
complications. The specific aims are to identify the effect of a single dose of perioperative steroid on dysphagia and to devel op a treatment protocol for 
the frequency of perioperative steroids n eeded to reduce dysphagia. This is a pros pective, randomized, placebo-controlled study . Patients will be given a 
single dose of dexamethasone or normal salin e intratoperatively and then assessed at mu ltiple time points up to one year. The r esearch question is what is 
the effect of a single dose of perioperative steroid on dysphagia  after anterior cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_685724]? The surv ey instruments  used to determine difficulty 
swallowing include the Bazaz, Dysphagia Short Questionnaire, and EAT 10. To administer the Bazaz instrument, the study coordina tor will ask the 
subject if he/she has difficulty swallowing liquid food and gi ve the options 'none', 'rare', 'p resent all the time'. The option s for solid food with are 'none', 
'rare', 'occasional only with specific foods', or 'frequent major ity of solids'. The options on th e left side of the questionna ire determine the level of 
difficulty. If a subject has no difficulty  swallowing both liquid and solid food, 'non e' will be chosen. The level of difficulty swallowing is determined by 
[CONTACT_685734], e.g. if a subject had no difficulty swallowing liquid food and has rare difficulty swallowing solid foo d, 'mild' will be chosen. If the 
subject has no difficulty swallowing liquid food but has frequent difficulty swallowi ng solid food, 'severe' will be chosen.

Collecting data, 4. How findings will be shared, etc.).
1.Potential subjects will see Drs. Daffner, [LOCATION_009], Cui, Sedney or Emer y at their visit pr ior to elective ante rior cervical spi [INVESTIGATOR_685725]. 2. Su bjects will be told about the study at this visit, all questions will be answer ed by [CONTACT_685735], all 
surveys that need to be completed will be shown to the potential subjects an d they will be given the opportunity to consent. 3.  If consented, the subject

Care Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) at this visit. 4. The subject will be randomized to receive either single dose s teroid (dexamethasone) 
or saline (placebo) prior to surg ery. The dose is calculated based on body weight  group will receive 0.3 mg/kg of in travenous d examethasone

cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_685726]. 6. After administration of the antib iotics in the operating room, the single dose of steroid or saline will be 
given by [CONTACT_108424], who are blinded to the group assignment, via an intravenous bag (study drug) prepared by [CONTACT_685736], 
the only person who knows the group assignment. 7. The surgeon, patient, and research team are blinded to the group assignment.  8. The subject will be

See lit review and scientific rationale under Notes and Attachments.What method are you going to  use to analyze the data?
Swallowing symptoms will be measured using the patient reported Bazaz Dysphagia Scale, EAT-[ADDRESS_929527]. Powe r and sample size calculations are based on the presence  or absence of 
dysphagia at two weeks. Based on a literature review, we postulat ed that 50% of the patients in  the control group would experie nce mild, moderate, or 
severe dysphagia. If that figure can be improved to the point wh ere just 20% of the patients are similarly affected then that, in our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would 
represent clinical success. Under the above scenario, 32 patients in each group would give us 81% power to reject the null hypo thesis. Assuming a 
dropout rate of 20% our total sample size for the study is 80. Statistical signif icance is set at p<0.05. We plan to analyze th e data in three ways. First, we 
will look at the time-to-event where the ev ent is "no dysphagia" in a discrete time su rvival model. Second, we will use a repea ted measures ordinal 
categorical model to assess the effect of steroid/control in a generalized linear model. Lastly , we will compare the data from this study with that of our 
previous three-dose model to assess any difference in  the degree of impact of the two dosing regimens.

Potential benefit is less difficulty swallowing if  the subject is assigned to the steroid group.
Describe the potential benefit(s) to society and/or scientific / medical knowledge of the planned work.
The results of this study will provide evid ence for the use of steroids as a treatment  for reducing the incidence and severity of dysphagia among patients 
undergoing anterior cervical spin e surgery. A recently performed study at our institution ha s promising results from a three-do se regimen of steroids. 
Similarly, two recent clinical studies have also shown decreas ed dysphagia with a multi-dose ster oid regimen. If the hypothesis  of this proposal is 
supported, the use of a single dose of perioperative steroid sp ecifically lends itself well to ap plication in patients undergoi ng these procedures in 
outpatient surgery centers, improving the safety of such procedures.

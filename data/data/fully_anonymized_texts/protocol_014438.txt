Name [CONTACT_23361]:  Pramlintide acetate and recombinant human insulin  
Study title  A Phase 2, Single -Dose, Randomized, Open -Label, Active -Controlled, Crossover, 
Pharmacodynamic, and Pharmacokinetic Comparative Study of a Novel 
Pramlintide -Insulin Co -Formulation in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus  
Protocol number  DPI-201 
No. of study centers  Up to 4 sites  in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  
Clinical phase  Phase [ADDRESS_983831] people with diabetes are still unable to achieve glycemic targets with sole 
insulin therapy alone, particularly after mealtime. Physiologic restoration of the 
hormonal responses during meals, via pramlintide and insulin, has been 
demonstrated to reduc e postprandial hyperglycemia and to improve blood glucose 
time in range.  
The synergy between insulin and pramlintide provides improved glucose control 
while reducing meal -time insulin requirements.  Reduced insulin utilization may 
also reduce the effects a ssociated with long -term insulin use such as weight gain 
and higher risks of hypoglycemia.  
A pramlintide -insulin co -formulation may help reduce the burden associated with 
co-administration (e g, reduce the number of injections per day). Additionally, co -
formulations of pramlintide and insulin may also improve treatment compliance 
and persistency.   
Study rationale  People with diabetes may have a significant loss of pancreatic beta cell function . 
This leads to a deficiency of 2 hormones: insulin and amylin. The combined effect 
of insulin and amylin is to regulate and normalize blood sugar levels.  
Pramlintide is an injectable drug that closely resembles amylin. Many clinical 
studies that add praml intide to insulin have demonstrated improved control of 
blood sugar.  
However, t he benefits of these products  used together also are associated with 
increase d risk of pramlintide -associated nausea  and vomiting; increased n umber of 
required injections; and t ailoring of insulin and pramlintide doses . 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals has developed a novel, liquid -stable, co -formulation of 
pramlintide plus regular insulin  (PRAM9) that can be delivered as a s ingle, 
subcutaneous (SC) injection. The fixed dose combination  product is expected to 
allow better manage ment of  patient glycemic c onditions through improved 
complianc e.   
Study objectives  Primary objective  
 Evaluate the pharmacodynamic  (PD)  properties  of a single dose of PRAM9 
compared to  single doses of regular insulin and regular insulin plus 
pramlintide (co -administered as separate injections) in adult s with type 1 
diabetes mellitus  (T1D)

 Secondary objective s 
 Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profiles of a single dose of 
PRAM9 compared to  single doses of regular insulin and regular insulin plus 
pramlintide (co -administered as separate injections) in adult s with T1D  
Study endpoints  Primary  
The PD effect s upon plasma  glucose levels will be compared between the 
treatments as defined by [CONTACT_720528]:  
 Area under the curve area from administration to 180 minutes (AUC 0-180) 
(mg/dL × minutes) for plasma glucose >  180 mg/dL  
Secondary  
Safety:  
 Incidenc e of adverse events ( AEs), serious adverse events ( SAEs )  
 Change from baseline in c linical safety laboratory evaluations 
(hematology and serum chemistry ) 
 Change in  vital sign measurements (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heart rate 
[HR], and blood pressure [BP])  
 Change from baseline in body weight  
 Local tolerability assessments (modified Draize  Scale  and injection site 
discomfort questionnaire s) 
PK/PD: 
Key secondary endpoints include  the following. The full lis t of secondary 
endpoint s is provided in Section 13.3.2.  
 Mean proportional time with plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL  for 
0-180 minutes after study drug administration  
 PK plasma levels ( AUC 0-90 min, AUC 0-180 min , AUC 0-360 min, C max, and T max) 
for both insulin and pramlintide  
 
 
Study design  This is a randomized, open -label, active -controlled, single -dose, 3-treatment, 
3-period, 3-way crossover , comparative PD, and PK inpatient study in adults with 
T1D.  
Methodology  The study comprises 5 visits:  Screening (Visit 1), Treatment Periods (Visits 2 − 
4), and Follow -Up (Visit 5).  
To determine eligibility, s ubjects will complete the Screening  procedures (Visit  1) 
up to [ADDRESS_983832] treatment visit (Visit 2) . Sub jects will be instructed to 
eat normally and take their usual medications, but to refrain from alcohol for 
[ADDRESS_983833] after midnight but will be allowed to drink ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0

 water ad libitum (ie, tap water, bottled water, distilled water, etc. [water without 
carbohydrates]) and take any prescribed medications.  
During each Treatment Period  Visit (Visits 2, 3, and 4) , eligible subjects will 
receive a single SC dose of PRAM9, regular insulin, or co -administered regular 
insulin plus pramlintide. On the morning of each treatment visit and prior to 
dosing, a fasting blood sample will be tested using a  blood glucose meter (BGM) 
to confirm that blood glucose is in the range of 80 to 150  mg/dL.   
 If the blood glucose is >  150 mg/dL after repeat test, then the investigator 
may treat with an intravenous (IV)  bolus dose of regular insulin, per 
discretion, to  bring the subject into the required blood glucose range. 
Before initiating study treatment, a t least [ADDRESS_983834] ’s glucose level 
should be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.  
 If the blood glucose is <  80 mg/dL after repeat test, then the investigator 
may treat with oral glucose tabs/solution or IV glucose , per discretion, to 
bring the subject into the required blood glucose range. Before initiating 
study treatment, at least [ADDRESS_983835]’s  glucose level should be within 
the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL . 
 If the subject’s blood glucose  cannot be optimized  to 80 to  150 mg/dL 
within 2 hours , then the visit shoul d be rescheduled after a minimum 
24-hour wait, per investigator’s discretion.  
At Visit 2, once blood glucose is confirmed to be within the range of 80 to 
150 mg/dL, subjects will be randomized to their study drug treatment sequence.

 Prior to study drug  administration, a peripheral catheter for blood sampling will be 
placed into a vein ideally located within the antecubital fossa. The hand of the arm 
used for blood sampling will be kept warm by [CONTACT_2363] a heated hand box to increase 
blood flow and achieve “arterialized” samples. The subject will remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_720511] (ad libitum).  
Once the catheter and hand box are in place, study drug(s) will be administered SC 
over 1 to 3 seconds to the abdomen (around the umbilic us). Co -administered 
regular insulin plus pramlintide injections should be administered to opposite sides 
of the abdomen (ie, left and right peri -umbilicus , opposite quadrants ). Injection 
sites should be rotated to avoid injecting at a previously used site .  
To monitor for hypoglycemia, BGM will be performed in real time at each 
subject’s bedside at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, and [ADDRESS_983837] dosing at 
Visit 2 through 4.  
To evaluate drug PD (plasma glucose response) and PK (plasma 
insulin/pramlint ide concentrations), blood samples are to be drawn at the time 
points described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2). 
Within [ADDRESS_983838] -dose blood draw, a standardized 
75-gram oral glucose challenge should be ingested (within 5 to 10  minutes) by [CONTACT_1560].  
After the last blood coll ection (at [ADDRESS_983839] -study drug administration), 
subjects are to be provided a regular meal  and insulin  (per investigators’ 
discretion).  
Injection sites will be evaluated by [CONTACT_720529] 
(Appendix  1) and subjects will complete injection site discomfort questionnaires 
(Appendix  2).  
A subject may be discharged from the clinic, per investigator’s criteria, when the 
following has occurred:  
 Subject has consumed their meal  
 Subject has returned to their usual medication regimen, including insulin  
 Subject’s capi[INVESTIGATOR_720512] >  100 mg/dL  
 Subject is considered medically stable  
Any time during the visit if hypoglycemia  occurs  (ie, blood glucose < 70 mg/dL), 
the subject will be rescued with IV dextrose  using the followi ng formula to 
calculate the dose of dextrose:  
D50% mL = (100 minus BG ) × 0.4  
Where D50% = the dose of IV dextrose, mL = the volume of dextrose, BG = 
the subject’s hypoglycemic blood glucose value  
 
The dose of dextrose should be administered slowly, over 2 to 5 minutes.  
If D50% is administered, then blood glucose will be remeasured by [CONTACT_720530] 10, 20, and 30 minutes following the end of administration of IV dextrose.  
Successful plasma glucose recovery should be confirmed (ie, glucose returns to  
≥ 70 mg/dL) and the subject medically stabilized . When the subject is medically 
stable, they can be discharged from the clinic (per criteria above) . 
After a first wash out period of  7 to 11 days, subjects will return to the clinic for 
Treatment Period  2 (Visit 3) and the treatment visit procedures will be repeated ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type [ADDRESS_983840] will 
receive their second administration of s tudy drug(s).  
After a second wash out period of 7 to 11 days, subjects will return to the clinic for 
Treatment Period 3  (Visit 4)  and the treatment visit procedures will be repeated 
with each subject crossed over to the last randomized study drug treatment  
sequence. Upon check -in and completion of morning activities, the subject will 
receive their third administration of study drug(s).  
During the Treatment Periods, subjects will undergo symptom -directed PEs, vital 
sign measurements, AE assessments, concomit ant medication assessments, and 
pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential .  
Follow -Up 
A Follow -up Visit (Visit 5) will be conducted [ADDRESS_983841]’s last 
dose of study drug(s). Subjects will return to the clinic and undergo co mplete PE, 
vital sign measurements, weight measurements, sample collection for hematology 
and chemistry, AE assessments, concomitant medication assessments, and 
pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential.

 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Medical Need  
The response of insulin and amylin to food intake is absent in patients with type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) due to autoimmune β -cell destruction [ Ludvik 1991, Koda 1992 , Herrmann 2016 ].  
Insulin therapy is the primary treatment option for patients with T1D. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_720515], delivery, and pharmacology, only a small 
percentage of diabetic patients achieve near normal glycemic levels with insulin replacem ent 
alone [ Klein 1996,  Whitehouse 2002 ].  The increased risk of severe hypoglycemia and undesired 
weight gain that usually accompany glycemic improvements with insulin therapy represent 
major obstacles toward achieving satisfactory glycemic control [ DCCT [ADDRESS_983871] 1988 , 
Purnell 1998 ].    
Pramlintide  [[COMPANY_008] Pharmaceuticals, LP, 2016 ], a soluble, nonaggregating, equipotent 
synthetic analog of amylin, is approved by [CONTACT_720533] T1D  and T2D patients who 
are unable to obtain near -normoglycem ia with insulin therapy.   In a study conducted in subjects 
with T1D with a mean HbA1c of 8.1 (mean age=41  years, mean duration of diabetes=20  years, 
mean body mass index (BMI)=28  kg/m2), pramlintide (SYMLIN®) or placebo was administered 
at major meals as an add on to insulin therapy at a dose of [ADDRESS_983872] at weekly 
intervals of 15  µg to maintenance doses of 30  µg or 60  µg.  The insulin dose was reduced by 
30% to 50% in order to minimize the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_720516] .  Those who receiv ed 
pramlintide had a mean percent reduction of 7.1% in the mealtime insulin dose at [ADDRESS_983873] 
study drug administration initiation compared with 2.4% reduction in the placebo group 
[[COMPANY_008] Pharmaceuticals, LP, 2016 ]. 
Many clinical studies that add  pramlintide to insulin have demonstrated improved control of 
blood sugar, lower hemoglobin A1c, and better patient satisfaction and well -being.  However, the 
benefits of these products used together also are associated with increased risk of pramlintide -
associated nausea and vomiting ; increased number of required injections; and tailoring of insulin 
and pramlintide doses  [[COMPANY_008] Pharmaceuticals, LP, 2016 ]. 
Although pramlintide does not cause hypoglycemia, when combined with insulin, the risk of 
severe  hypoglycemia is increased .  In subjects with T1D, in 6 -month controlled trials without 
insulin reduction at initiation, the incidence of severe hypoglycemia was 16.8% (0 to 3  months, 
n=716) in subjects receiving pramlintide and insulin , as compared with 1 0.8% (0 to 3  months, 
n=538)  in subjects receiving placebo and insulin  [[COMPANY_008] Pharmaceuticals, LP, 2016 ]. 
In addition to the risk of hypoglycemia , separated administrations of insulin and amylin at 
distinct times before meals, varying doses, and multi ple injection sites are impediments to patient 
compliance that counter the known therapeutic benefits of pramlintide .  A fixed -ratio, single -
injection of a co -formulated insulin -pramlintide preparation would be desirable in mimicking 
physiological patterns  [Riddle 2015 , da Silva 2018 ].  
4.2. Xeris’ Pramlintide -Insulin Injection  
Xeris Pharmaceuticals has developed a liquid -stable , co-formulation  of a fixed -ratio combination 
of 9 µg pramlintide  per unit of regular insulin  (PRAM9) that can be delivered as a single SC ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0 
 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc  Confidential  Page 24 of 78 
 injection .  The fixed -dose combination is designed to reduce the treatment burden associated 
with concomitant insulin and pramlintide therapy, ie, reduce the number of daily aggregate 
injections because the pramlintide would not require separate mealtime injections.  
In nonclinical studies, the pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamic  (PD) characteristics  of 
pramlintide and Humulin ® (or regular insulin) or Humalog ® (lispro ins ulin) were studied in 
normal and streptozotocin -induced diabetic rats (ST Z; mimicking T1D) .  Treatments were given 
as separate injections of commercial products or as Xeris’ pramlintide -insulin combined dose 
single injection .  Consistent with pramlintide’s known pharmacological action, there was no 
glucose lowering with pramlin tide alone for either the commercial or Xeris formulation .  
Additionally , glycemic profiles for pramlintide were similar to saline or Xeris vehicle 
administered by [CONTACT_720534] .  Xeris’ pramlintide -insulin formulation showed a longer 
duration of glucose lowering compared to separate injections of commercial pramlintide 
(Symlin®) and insulin (Humulin®).   
This clinical study has been designed to compare the PD, PK, and safety  of PRAM9 with regular 
insulin and regular insulin pl us pramlintide (co -administered as separate injections) when 
injected subcutaneously (SC) in the abdomen of fasted adult s with T1D.   A detailed description 
of, and rationale for the dosing regimen for this study is located in Section 9.1. ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0

 5. STUDY  OBJECTIVES AND PURP OSE  
5.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to e valuate the PD properties of a single dose of PRAM9 
compared to single doses o f regular insulin and regular insulin plus pramlintide (co -administered 
as separate injections) in adult s with T1D . 
5.2. Secondary O bjectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are to e valuate the safety and PK profiles of a single dose 
of PRAM9 compared to single doses of regular insulin and regular insulin plus pramlintide 
(co-administered as separate injections) in adult s with T1D . 
5.3. Study Endpoints  
Primary  
The PD effect s upon plasma  glucose levels will be comp ared between the treatments as defined 
by [CONTACT_720528]:   
 Area under the curve area from administration to 180 min (AUC 0-180) (mg/dL × 
minutes) for plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL

crossover , comparative PD  and PK inpatient study in adults with T1D .  The study  comprise s 
5 visits:  Screening (Visit 1), Treatment Period s (Visits 2 − 4), and Follow -Up (Visit 5).  
To determine eligibility, subjects will complete the Screening procedures (Visit  1) up to [ADDRESS_983876] treatment visit (Visit 2).  Subjects will be instructed to ea t normally and take their 
usual medications, but to refrain from alcohol for [ADDRESS_983877] after midnight 
but will be allowed to drink water ad libitum (ie, tap water, bottled water, distilled water, etc. 
[water without carbohydrates]) and take any prescribed medications.  
During each Treatment Period  Visit, subjects will receive a singl e SC dose of PRAM9, regular 
insulin, or co -administered regular insulin plus pramlintide.  On the morning of each treatment 
visit and prior to dosing, a fasting blood sample will be tested using a blood glucose meter  
(BGM)  to confirm that blood glucose is in the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.   
 If the blood glucose is >  150 mg/dL after repeat test, then the investigator may treat 
with a n intravenous ( IV) bolus dose of  regular insulin, per discretion, to bring the 
subject into the required blood glucose range .  Before initiating study treatment, at 
least [ADDRESS_983878]’s glucose level should be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.  
 If the blood glucose is < 80 mg/dL after repeat test, then t he investigator may treat 
with oral glucose tabs/solution or IV glucose, per discretion, to bring the subject into 
the required blood glucose range .  Before initiating study treatment, at least 
[ADDRESS_983879]’s  glucose level should be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.  
 If the subject’s blood glucose cannot be optimized to 80  to 150 mg/dL within 2  hours, 
then the visit should be rescheduled after a minimum 24 -hour wait, per investiga tor’s 
discretion .   
At Visit 2, once blood glucose is confirmed to be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL, subjects 
will be randomized to their study drug treatment sequence.  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0

Insulin -to-carbohydrate calculations will be used to identify subject doses.  All subjects will get 
flexible doses of insulin, pramlintide, and PRAM9.  See Section  9.[ADDRESS_983880]’s insulin -to-carbohydrate (I:C) ratio to match a 75 -gram carbohydrate challenge.  
Rule 450 will be used for carbohydrate counting and insulin dose calcula tion in this study (see 
Appendix  3).   
Prior to dose administration, a peripheral catheter for blood sampling  will be placed into a vein 
ideally located  within the antecubital fossa .  The hand of the arm used for blood sampling will be 
kept warm by [CONTACT_2363] a heated hand box to increase blood flow and achieve “arterialized” 
samples .  The subject will remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_720517]  
(ad libitum).   
Once the catheter and hand box are in place, study drug(s) will be administered SC over 1 to 
3 seconds to the abdomen (around the umbilicus) .  Co-administered regular insulin plus 
pramlintide injections should be administered to oppos ite sides of the abdomen (ie, left and right 
peri-umbilicus, opposite quadrants) .  Injection sites should be rotated to avoid injecting at a 
previously used site.  
To monitor for hypoglycemia, BGM will be performed in real time at each subject’s bedside at  
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, and [ADDRESS_983881] dosing  at Visit 2 through 4 . BGM 
measurements from the cool hand are allowed.  
To evaluate drug PD ( plasma glucose  response) , blood samples are to be drawn at 10  ± 2 minutes 
before and immediately (-2 to 0 minutes)  prior to study drug injection .  After study drug 
injection, blood samples also will be collected  at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 
300, and [ADDRESS_983882] -dosing (window allowance of ±  2 minutes) . After the [ADDRESS_983883]’s hand must be reinserted into the heated box for at least 
10 minutes prior to the next blood collection . ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0

 To evaluate drug PK  (plasma insulin/pramlintide concentrations ), blood samples are to be drawn 
at 10 ± 2 minutes before and  immediately  (-2 to 0 minutes)  prior to study drug injection .  After 
study drug injection , blood samples also will be collected at  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 
180, 240, 300, and [ADDRESS_983884] -dosing (window allowance of ±  2 minutes) . 
Within [ADDRESS_983885] -dose blood draw, a standardized 75 -gram oral 
glucose challenge should be ingested (within 5 to 10  minutes) by [CONTACT_423].  
After the last blood collection (at [ADDRESS_983886] -study drug administration), subjects are to b e 
provided a regular meal and insulin (per investigators’ discretion).  
At 30, 90, and 360 minutes  (± 2 minutes ) post-dose, injection sites will be evaluated by [CONTACT_720535] ( Appendix  1).  Additionally, subjects will complete 
an injection site discomfort questionnaire at 10 and 30 minutes (± 2 minutes ) post-dose 
(Appendix  2).   
A subject may be discharged from the clinic , per investigator’s criteria, when  the following has 
occurred:  
 Subject has consumed their meal  
 Subject has returned to their usual medication regimen , including insulin  
 Subject’s capi[INVESTIGATOR_720512] >  100 mg/dL  
 Subject is considered medically stable  
Any time  during the visit i f hypoglycemia  occurs  (ie, blood glucose < 70 mg/dL), the subject 
will be rescued with IV dextrose  using the  following formula to calculate the dose of dextrose:  
D50%  mL = (100 minus BG ) × 0.4  
Where D50% = the dose of IV dextrose, mL = the volume of dextrose, BG = the subject’s 
hypoglycemic blood glucose value  (ADA, 2008; Joslin Center, 2013 ) 
The dose of dextros e should be administered slowly, over 2 to 5 minutes.  
If D50% is administered, then blood glucose will be remeasured by [CONTACT_720536] 10, 
20, and 30  minutes following the end of administration of IV dextrose.  
Successful plasma glucose recovery sho uld be confirmed (i e, glucose returns to ≥  70 mg/dL) and

reschedule the missed vis it.  This includes contact[CONTACT_226111], including 
family members or emergency contacts .  If such efforts fail, a certified letter should be sent to 
the subject’s last known address requesting they contact [CONTACT_464].  
In all circums tances, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, per the follow -
up.  Information regarding the reason for not completing the study will be recorded in the 
electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  The investigator should inquire about the reason  for 
withdrawal, request that the subject return for a final visit, and follow -up with the subject 
regarding any unresolved AEs.  It will be documented whether each subject completed the study.   
If a decision by [CONTACT_720537] a subject, a final visit should be 
scheduled soon after the decision to withdraw is made.  The subject will be asked to return to site 
for the assessments listed in Section  10.3 (Follow -Up Visit).  
If the subject withdraws from the study and withdraws consent, no further evaluations should be 
performed, and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to 
use any data co llected before such withdrawal of consent.   
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination

Type [ADDRESS_983892]’s concomitant medication regimen after the first treat ment on Day [ADDRESS_983893] 28 days prior to Screening, and they will be encouraged to avoid making changes 
(excepting insulin ) to their concomitant medication regimen during participation in the study.   In 
addition, investigators are encouraged to avoid adding to or changing a participant’s medications 
during study participation unless deemed medically necessary.  
Diabetes Medica tion  
Subject diabetes medication will be recorded on the day of screening:  
 Total daily meal -time insulin  
o Type of insulin (regular insulin, lispro, or aspart)  
 Basal insulin  
o Type of insulin (glargine, detemir, or degludac)  
 Total daily dose of insulin  
 Gluca gon-like peptide -1 (GLP -1) analogue   
8.2. Randomization  
On the morning of Visit 2, subjects will be randomized into the appropriate treatment sequence 
order to receive each of the 3 study treatments ( PRAM9, regular insulin, and co-administered 
regular insulin plus pramlintide ).  The study statistician will create the randomization sequence 
using random permuted block methodology.    See Table [ADDRESS_983894] study drug will be replaced .  Up to 
3 subjects may be replaced.  
8.5. Occurrence of Hypoglycemia  
If hypoglycemia occurs (ie, blood glucose <70 mg/dL), the subject will be rescued with IV 
dextrose  using the following formula to calculate the dose of dextrose:  
D50% mL = (100 minus BG ) × 0.4  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0 
 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc  Confidential  Page 34 of 78 
 Where D50 % = the dose of IV dextrose , mL = the volume of dextrose , BG = the subject’s 
hypoglycemic blood glucose value  (ADA, 2008; Jos lin Center, 2013 ) 
The dose of dextrose should be administered slowly, over 2 to 5 minutes.  
If D50% is administered, then b lood glucose will be remeasured by [CONTACT_720536] 10, 
20, and 30  minutes following the end of administration of IV dextrose . 
Successful plasma glucose recovery should be confi rmed (ie, glucose returns to ≥  70 mg/dL) and 
the subject medically stabilized .  When the subject is medically stable, they can be discharged 
from the clinic .  A subject may be discharged from the clinic , per investigator’s criteria, when  
the following has occurred:  
 Subject has consumed their meal  
 Subject has returned to their usual medication regimen , including insulin  
 Subject’s capi[INVESTIGATOR_720512] >  100 mg/dL  
 Subject is considered medically stable  
Any occurrence of hypoglyc emia must be recorded in the Adverse Event (AE) eCRF.   ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type [ADDRESS_983895] is prepared as a sterile liquid for injection that 
is packaged as a 0.9 mg/mL pramlintide + 3 .5 mg/mL insulin solution for injection in a 3 -mL 
glass vial (2.5 mL fill volume).  
The dose of PRAM9 is to be based upon the subject’s historical mealtime insulin dose (based 
upon the subject’s historical carbohydrate: insulin ratio) .  The historical insul in dose will be 
reduced by 50%  to derive the new insulin dose .  The associated pramlintide dose will be related 
to the dosage of insulin (eg, 9 µg pramlintide per 1  U of insulin).   
PRAM9 is to be administered SC (in the abdomen, peri -umbilicus).  
9.1.2.  Regular Insulin: Humulin® R (U -100) (regular insulin human injection)   
The dose of r egular insulin  is to be based upon the subject’s historical mealtime insulin dose  
(based upon the subject’s historical carbohydrate: insulin ratio) .  Insulin is to be administered SC 
(in the abdomen , peri -umbilicus ). 
Note:  The calculated insulin dose should be rounded to the closest whole unit.  For rounding, if 
the digit to the right of the decimal is ≤ 4, round down (example 4.3 units = 4 units).  If the digit 
to the right of the  decimal is ≥ 5, round up (example 4.5 units = 5 units).  
9.1.3.  Regular Insulin Plus P ramlintide   
Regular insulin plus pramlintide is to be co -administered as separate injections.  
The n ew insulin dose is to be based upon the subject’s historical mealtime insulin dose (based 
upon the subject’s historical carbohydrate: insulin ratio) .  This historical dose will be reduced by 
50% to be the new insulin dose .  The associated pramlintide dose will be calculated from the new 
dosage of insulin (eg, 9 µg pramlintide per 1 U of insulin) .  The dosage of pramlintide will then 
be adjusted to the nearest increment on the Symlin ® pen (eg , nearest 15 µg increment) . 
Regular insulin plus pramlintide is to be administered SC (in the abdomen, peri -umbilicus).  The 
separate, co -adminis tered regular insulin and pramlintide injections should be given to opposite 
sides of the abdomen (ie, left and right peri -umbilicus , opposite quadrants ). 
 
9.1.4.  Study Drug  Doses 
All subjects will get flexible  doses of insulin, pramlintide , and PRAM9.   The dose of regular 
insulin is calculated to correspond to a ratio of 9 g of pramlintide for every [ADDRESS_983896]’s insulin -to-carbohydrate ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0

 Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria by a study investigator  
 Urine drug screen . Note: At the investigator’s discretion, subjects with a positive 
result for drugs other than THC (which is allowed at the investigat or’s discretion) will 
be allowed to participate if the subject reports use of a concomitant medication that 
explains the result ( eg, positive urine test for opi[INVESTIGATOR_226076] a subject reporting use of 
cough syrup containing dextromethorphan).  
 Full PE (excluding  breast, pelvic, rectal, and genitourinary exams ); to include 
measurement of height and weight (no shoes, lightly clothed)  
 12-lead ECG (after the subject has completed a [ADDRESS_983902]; ECG 
to be obtained before assessment of BP and HR, and  prior to blood collections)  
 Assessment of vital signs, including temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], HR, and BP , after a 
5-minute seated rest  
 Collection of venous blood for hematology, serum chemistry, and measurement of 
C-peptide and HbA1c (see Section 11.3.4  for complete listing of laboratory 
parameters)  
 Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and discussion about study 
requirements regarding contraception

 12. SAFETY AND ADVERSE E VENT (AE) REPORTING  
12.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associ ated with the use of a medicinal product, whether considered related to 
the medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include:  
 Abnormal test findings  
 Clinically significant symptoms and signs  
 Changes in PE findings which are untoward and deemed clinically signif icant by [CONTACT_1275]  
 Allergy/hypersensitivity  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding may be reported as an 
AE are as follows:  
 Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms  
 Test result requires additional diagnos tic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
 Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other treatment  
 Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_1720] s ponsor  
Repeat of a test based on an abnormal result in the absence of the above conditions does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result determined to be an error does not require reporting 
as an AE.  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE that eith er commenced following initiation of study 
treatment or was present prior to study treatment but increased in frequency or severity following 
initiation of study treatment.  
Standard medical terminology should be used in describing AEs.  Informal descriptio ns should 
be avoided.  
12.1.1.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
rapid comm unication by [CONTACT_198571]. Such an event 
might require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it (ICH E2F, 2008).  
AESIs for PRAM9 are as follows: hypoglycemia, nausea, and vomiting.  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type [ADDRESS_983922] concur with that assessment.  
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by [CONTACT_456], any nonserious AE that is 
determined to be serious (according to the FDA definitions of an SAE) will be reported by [CONTACT_720540].  To assist i n the determination of case seriousness, further information may 
be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the 
context of the clinical study.  
12.3. Reporting Period  
For all AEs, the reporting period to Xeris Pharmace uticals begins from the subject providing 
informed consent, through the Follow -Up Visit .  All AEs will be followed until resolution or the 
subject is medically stable.  
12.4. Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose which:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event (IME)  
Medica l and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such an IME that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_720521] y require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above .  These events should also 
usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias or convulsions which do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0 
 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc  Confidential  Page 47 of 78 
 12.5. Severity Assessment  
On the AE eCRF, the investigator will use the adjectives “mild,” “moderate,” or “severe” to 
describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  These intensity grades are  defined as follows in  
Table 7, which follows.  
Table 7: Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
Mild  Does not interfere with subject’s usual function  
Moderate  Interferes to some extent (<  50%) with subject’s usual function  
Severe  Interferes significantly (≥  50%) with subject’s usual function  
The terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to 
describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event.  The event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance.  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on 
subject/event outcome or action criteria.  Accordingly, a severe event is not necessarily a serious 
event.  
12.6. Causality Assessment  
The inve stigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an AE to the study 
drug, where an affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction: “Is there 
a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event?” A ‘‘reasonab le possibility’’ means that 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  The 
investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (related or unrelated).  The 
investigator must record the causal relationsh ip in the eCRF, as appropriate, and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable ( Section  12.9).  All 
investigator assessments of AEs must be documented in the source documentation.  
12.7. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response and 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  When a subject  withdraws due to an SAE, the SAE must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements (see Section  12.9). 
12.8. Eliciting Adverse Event Information and Reporting  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_65850].  Each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  Each AE is to be assessed to 
determine if it meets the criteria fo r SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow the 
provisions of Section 12.9. 
12.9. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
If an SAE o ccurs, Xeris Pharmaceuticals is to be notified within 24 hours of awareness of the 
event by [CONTACT_093].  If the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Xeris ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type [ADDRESS_983923] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE 
information.  This time frame also applies to follow -up on previously forwarded SAE reports.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, a study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere),  the investigator is to report 
the event within [ADDRESS_983924] be reported to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee(s) 
immediately, whether  it is considered treatment -related.  Initial SAE reports must be followed by 
[CONTACT_3896].  These should include copi[INVESTIGATOR_720522] r documents 
when requested.  Telephone and email reports must be confirmed promptly either by [CONTACT_720541].  
Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee(s) is required to notify FDA and 
all participating invest igators in an IND safety report (ie, 7 - or 15 -day expedited report) of 
potentially serious risks from clinical trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no later 
than 15 calendar days after the safety information is received and a determination i s made that 
the information qualifies for reporting.  
12.10.  Nonserious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the eCRF.  AEs should be reported using concise 
medical terminology on the eCRFs as well as on the form for collection of the SAE information.  
12.11.  AE Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
AE reporting by [CONTACT_456], including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable regulations.  
The investigator mu st notify the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of the occurrence of 
any SAE, in writing, as soon as is practicable and in accordance with local regulations.  A copy 
of this notification must be provided to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee.  
In the event of an SAE that meets the criteria for expedited reporting, an SAE report will be 
prepared for submission to the FDA and any other applicable authorities by [CONTACT_226115].  
12.12.  Pregnancy   
The active pharmaceutical product s in Xeri s Pharmaceuticals’ PRAM9 pramlintide -insulin  are in 
Pregnancy Category B.  Female subjects of childbearing potential will be tested (urine) for 
pregnancy at the Screening  Visit.  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is  
post menarche al, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea 
with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization 
(removal of ovaries and/or uterus).  
Any subject found to be pregnant at the Screen ing Visit (Visit 1) will not be randomized to a 
treatment  sequence .  Any subject who is found to be pregnant at one of the treatment visits will 
be withdrawn from the study immediately and no further study treatments will be given .  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-[ZIP_CODE] Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type [ADDRESS_983925] one dose of study drug will be followed until resolution (ie, 
birth or voluntary or spontaneous termination of the pregnancy).  Any pregnancy outcome that

PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type [ADDRESS_983926].  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_226079] -investigator will also be available ( eg, “on call ”) for the remainder of the 
treatment visit.  If necessary, a physician,  either at the study site or in a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307], will 
administer treatment for any AEs.  
Safety parameters, including laboratory results, will be assessed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_720523]’s criteria for clinical laboratory  acceptance ranges as suggested 
guidelines in making the medical assessment.  
Scheduled safety measurements will be repeated according to appropriate SOPs  or upon request 
from a physician.  Any abnormal repeated measurement will be evaluated by a physician and 
repeated if judged necessary.  Further action may be taken on the physician’s request.  
Subjects will be advised to notify their health care professionals (eg, physician, dentist, and/or 
pharmacist) that they are participating in a clinical research study of  a drug called PRAM9 
before taking any medicines or undergoing any medical procedure.

 14. DATA HANDLING, RECOR D KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645], MONITORIN G AND 
AUDITS  
14.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff under the supervision of the 
investigator.  During the study, the investigator will maintain complete and accurate 
documentation for the study.  
As defined in the ICH Guidelines f or Good Clinical Practice (E6(R2)), Section 1.52, source 
documents may include:  original documents, data, and records (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, participant’s diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , or 
transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, participant files, and records ke pt 
at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical 
study).  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF is understood to refer to an electronic data record, ie, an 
eCRF.  An eCRF is required and should be comple ted for each individual subject.  The 
completed original eCRFs are the property of Xeris Pharmaceuticals and should not be made 
available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Xeris 
Pharmaceuticals or appropriate regulatory  authorities, without written permission from Xeris 
Pharmaceuticals.  
Queries generated by [CONTACT_720544] .  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all responses to eC RF 
queries.  
14.2. Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Xeris Pharmaceuticals, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, eg , eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent 
documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records 
of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters,  
meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be retained by [CONTACT_720545], local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, 
whichever is longer.  The investigator must obtain Xeris Pharmaceutica ls’ written permission 
before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
14.3. Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_226125]/or its designee will 
be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA and  ICH GCP and Good Laboratory Practices 
(GLP) guidelines.

study records, including proof of IRB/IEC review, with the stipulation that subject 
confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with local and federal reg ulations, including 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA) requirements.  The monitor will 
also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting eCRFs and source 
documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data .  eCRFs will be checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other subject records.  Instances of missing or 
uninterpretable data will be resolved in  coordination with the investigator.

 Appendix  2. INJECTION SITE DISCOMFORT ASSESSMENT  
Numeric Rating  Scale (NRS ) for Injection Site Discomfort  
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the 11-point NRS  for Injection Site 
Discomfort at 10 and 30 minutes (± 2  minutes) after injection of study drug. The subject will complete 
the NRS by [CONTACT_740] a circle around the number  corresponding to the perceived intensity (severity) of 
discomfort according to the instructions below. The goal is for the subject to report the amount of 
discomfort, if any, remaining at each time point, as opposed to  reporting the transient pain associated with 
needle insertion.  
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the subject will indicate the number 
on the NRS corresponding to their level of discomfort, and study staff will circle i t. Documentation will be 
provided on each completed questionnaire as to who completed the form.  
Subject Instructions:  Ignoring any pain from insertion of the needle, please draw a circle around the 
number on  the scale below that corresponds to the intensit y (severity) of any discomfort you are feeling 
right now  at the study drug injection site.  
For example,  if you are currently feeling no discomfort, you should circle the number “0” on the left end 
of scale. If you are currently feeling the worst discomfor t possible, you should circle number “10”  on the 
right end of the scale.

 APPENDIX  3. INSULIN TO CARBOHYDRATE RATIO  
Insulin -to-Carb Ratio  
This ratio tells you how many grams of carb are covered by [CONTACT_720552].  
Use your insulin -to-carb ratio every time you eat a meal. You may use it with snacks if advised 
by [CONTACT_382064].  
The starting insulin to carb ratio is calculated by [CONTACT_10540] 450 Rule . Here’s how it works:  
 Determine your total daily dose (TDD) of insulin.  
o This includes both your meal time  and basal insulin  used within a day .  
o TDD  = _______   
 Divide 450 by [CONTACT_720553].  
o Insulin Carbohydrate Ratio = 450/TDD = _______  
 To use the ratio, add up the  grams of carb that you plan to eat at your meal , and 
divide this number by [CONTACT_720554] .  
 
Example 1:  
Someone’s TDD = 45 units ( e.g., the total amount of say Humalog and Lente insulins they used 
per day).  450 divided by 45 = 10 . Therefore, 10  grams of carbohydrate are covered by [CONTACT_720555] .  
 
The insulin to carbohydrate has a ratio of 1:10, meaning that 1 unit of regular  insulin “covers” 10 
grams of carbohydrate.  
 
If you will be eating 70 grams of carbohydrate, then divide 70 by 10, which equals 7. This means 
that you would take 7 units of insulin to cover the 70 grams of carb.  
 
Example 2:  
Someone’s  TDD = 50 units  (e.g., the total amount of say Humalog and Lente ins ulins they used 
per day).  450 divided by 50 equals 9. Therefore, 9 grams of carbohydrate are covered by [CONTACT_720556].  
 
The insulin to carbohydrate the starting insulin to carb ratio is 1:9,  meaning that 1 unit of regular 
insulin “covers” 9 grams of carbohydrate.  
 
If you will be eating 7 2 grams of carbohydrate, then divide 7 2 by 9, which equals 8. This means 
that you would take 8 units of insulin to cover the 7 2 grams of carb.  
 
Based upon your ratio, the accompanying table s may be helpful to estimate the regular insulin 
mealtime dose:

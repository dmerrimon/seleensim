5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph ) 
The moderate -to-severe pain many patients experience following surgery is often treated with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which are associated with side effects such as nausea/vomiting, sedation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826] (and a risk of abuse, dependence , and diversion ).  Potent site -specific analgesia with 
fewer side effects may be provided with peripheral nerve blocks .  However, these too have limitations 
such as a duration of action measured in hours, while the pain from surgery is usually measured in 
days or weeks.   Peripheral nerve stimulation or “ne uromodulation” is an alternative method of pain 
control involving the introduction of electrical current to stimulate various nerves that do not carry 
pain sensations, but which then decreases communication between  pain fibers and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_747351]/or brain.  Placing small electrodes specifically i n the area of the ear is called “auricular 
neuromodulation ” and  is theorized to function by [CONTACT_747374] a part of the brain call ed the “limbic system” which is involved with many aspects of 
behavior including responses to stress .  A device that delivers auricular neuromodulation, the 
“Bridge ” system, is approved by [CONTACT_747375][INVESTIGATOR_747352] [ADDRESS_1022582] that it may provide postoperative analgesia  as well.  The device itself is relatively simple to 
apply ; has few contraindications , side effects , or adverse events ; and has no potential for 
dependence , abuse,  or diversion .  Therefore, it has the potential to  concurrently improve analgesia 
and decrease or even negate opi[INVESTIGATOR_747353] , only  without the limitations of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_747354] .  The purpose of th is pi[INVESTIGATOR_747355], optimize the study protocol,  
and estimate the treatment effect in preparation for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a subsequent definitive clinical trial.

Specific Aim 1:  To determine the  feasibility  and optimize  the protocol for a subsequent clinical 
trial that will compare the addition of percutaneous auricular neuromodulation to  usual and 
customary analgesia following moderate -to-severely painful surg ical procedures .

neuromodulation  to usual and customary analgesia on pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] f ollowing 
various  surgical procedures .  This will provide an idea of the optimal surgical procedures 
amenable to this analgesic technique and allow determination of the required sample size  of a 
subsequent  definitive clinical trial . 
 
Hypothesis 1:  Auricular neuromodulation decreases pain in the 5 days following moderate -to-
severely painful surgical procedures currently treated with a single -injection peripheral nerve 
block.  
 
Hypothesis 2:  Auricular neuromodulation decreases opi[INVESTIGATOR_174050] 5 days following moderate -

7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
The moderate -to-severe pain many patients experience following surgery is often treated with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which are associated with side effects such as nausea/vomiting, sedation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826] (and a risk of abuse, dependence , and diversion ).  Potent site -specific analgesia with 
fewer side effects may be provided with peripheral nerve blocks .  However, these too have limitations 
such as requiring a n anesthesiologist for administration, a duration of action measured in hours, and 
rendering the target area/limb insensate . 
 
An analgesic alternative with few associated limitations is neuromodulation .  Below  the foramen 
magnum, t his technique is based on Melzack and Wall’s “gate control theory” in which electric current 
stimulates large -diameter afferent peripheral nerves that subsequently interrupt communication (the 
“gate”) from small -diameter pain fibers to the central nervous system at the level of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].[ADDRESS_1022583] “gating” has been hypothesized.[ADDRESS_1022584] 
that stimulation of one part of the ear —the “cymba conchae” just posterior to the crus of the helix —
results in activation of the primary somatosensory cortex, amygdala, fornix, thalamus and insula; and 
deactivation of the hippocampus and hypothalamus.2  However, the peri -auricular innervation is very 
complex with contributions from cranial nerves V (auriculotemporal branch of the mandibular nerve), 
VII (posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve) , IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) and X (auricular 
branch of the vagus nerve) as well as the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_747356] 2nd and 3rd 
cervical levels .3  Stimulation of different anatomic locations results in differing effects, although all 
sites are believed to influence the limbic system  which is involved with many aspects of behavior , 
including responses to stress.3 
 
Additional possible m echanisms for auricular neuromodulation are multifactorial , complex, and only 
partially understood.1  They  include the modulation of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and 
endorphinergic pathways with associated release of serotonin, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and endogenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_747357] -endorphins.4  Vagal stimulation further chemically modulates nociceptive (pain) 
processing, anxiety, and depression.5,6  Many neurotransmitters are influenced , such as increasing 
gamma -aminobutyric acid  (GABA) which can lead to anxiolysis.[ADDRESS_1022585] , and finally to multiple organs  via 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_153315].1  Given the large number of effects auricular stimulation produces, it is unsurprising 
that it has multiple therapeutic uses, including treating neurological  (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) , inflammatory, and 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 3 cardiovascular disorders; metabolic syndromes; psychiatric symptoms and disorders (e.g., anxiety, 
depression , autism );8 as well as multiple pain conditions.7 The auricular neuromodulation device 
proposed in the current study —the NSS-2 Bridge —is FDA cleared to r educe symptoms associated 
with opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351].9-[ADDRESS_1022586] 
that this device may also provide analgesia and /or decreases opi[INVESTIGATOR_58328].12-14  The 
proposed mechanisms for these findings are, unsurprisingly, multifactorial.   
 
Anti-nociceptive mechanisms.   As noted previously, stimulation of the vagus nerve chemically 
modulates nociceptive (pain) processing, anxiety, and depression.5,[ADDRESS_1022587] “gating” mechanism is not possi ble with stimulation of cranial nerves .  However, 
an indirect gating mechanism is theorized since afferent cranial nerve fibers end in the lower medulla 
(specifically the nucleus of the solitary tract);15,[ADDRESS_1022588] .19-21  It is probable 
that traditional auricular acupuncture shares these mechanisms;[ADDRESS_1022589] the stimulation itself, suggesting a mechanism for the prolonged 
analgesia reported in clinical use.26,27 
 
Indeed, auricular neuromodulation has been reported to provide analgesia and/or decrease 
supplemental analgesic requirements for a plethora of indications, including chronic pain states26,[ADDRESS_1022590] possible analgesic improvements following gastric by[CONTACT_6476],12 kidney donor surgery,13 and 
Cesarean delivery.14 
 
The NSS-2 Bridge  (Masimo, Irvine, CA) is a small, single -use, drug -
free, non -surgical, battery -powered stimulator that is adhered 
directly to the skin behind the ear [figure].  Three electrodes and one 
ground are introduced through the skin with tiny integrated solid -bore 
needles which do not require pretreatment with intra -dermal anesthesia 
(e.g., lidocaine skin wheal).   The device is FDA cleared to reduce 
symptoms associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_747358] 5 
days .9-11  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_747359], insomnia, 
muscle aches, nausea, and vomiting, all of which are frequent 
following surgery .39  There are only three relative contraindications to 
use:  concurrent u se of another neuromodulation device (e.g., cardiac 

 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 4 pacemaker ), bleeding disorder or anticoagulation , and skin abnormality at the treatment site such as 
psoriasis vulgaris .  Treatment -emergent adverse events (19,312 skin punctures in total) included 
minor bleeding at the skin (0.91%), dermatitis (0.91%), and significant pain during placement 
(0.17%).[ADDRESS_1022591]  a Class II risk designation, a class that includes surgical gloves 
and sphygmomanometer s (blood pressure cuff s).  With its ease of insertion, low risk of adverse 
events , lack of  side effects, prolonged duration of action, and simple removal, auricular 
neuromodulation has the very real possibility of replacing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] —the standard of 
care for the past 100 years —that would completely revolutionize postoperative analgesia, as 
we know it . 
 
Device  risk catagorization .  Treatment of postoperative pa in is not currently an FDA cleared 
indication.  However, the investigators believe the Bridge to be a nonsignificant risk device  
regardless of the indication (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801], analgesia, antiemetic) .  Per the 
FDA, a significant risk device is one that “presents a potential for serious risk to the health, 
safety, or welfare of a subject. ” 
 
Of the risks of the Bridge device, “ minor bleeding ” at the skin (0.91%) included a s little as a  single 
drop of blood ; but regardless, any bleeding is less serious than most childhood scratches and is 
treated with simple pressure.  There is no risk of hemorrhage, and w e do not believe this risk rises 
to the level of a “serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare” of a patient.  Similarly, the risk of 
dermatitis  (0.91%) is due to the adhesive on the bandages used to hold in the leads and the unit 
behind th e ear —it is a similar adhesive to that used for “Band -Aids”.  If any dermatitis occurs, the 
unit can simply be removed,  and the dermatitis resolves without treatment.  Therefore, we do not 
believe this rises to the level of a “serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare” of a patient.  The 
0.17% incidence of “ significant pain  during placement” involved patients in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -withdrawal 
having the leads inserted with no analgesic added.  Patients in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -withdrawal experience 
hyperalgesia and yet the incide nce was only 0.17%.  Our postsurgical patients will have been 
provided opi[INVESTIGATOR_747360], intraoperative and postoperative pain, and to  decrease 
sympathetic response during intubation for patients having a general anesthetic .  We therefore  
anticipate the risk of severe pain to  be far lower than 0.17% —most -likely zero.   The standard of 
care pain medication for surgery is expected to provide sufficient analgesia for placement of the 
device . 
 
Per the FDA, non-significant risk devices  “include most daily -wear contact [CONTACT_747376], ultrasonic dental scalers, and Foley catheters  [emphasis added] .”  There is no know 
incidence of infection  with the Bridge device.  In contrast, a Foley catheter —determined to be a 
nonsignificant risk device by [CONTACT_1622] —has an overall infection incidence of 10.5% (15.5% in 
women); and a urinary tract infection can develop into pyelonephritis with significant morbidity and 
mortality  [Saint et al. JAMA Intern Med. 2018;178(8):1078 -85].  So, if the FDA has designated the 
Foley catheter with its 10.5% incidence of infection as a nonsignificant risk device, we believe that 
the Bridge with no known infections in over [ADDRESS_1022592]  to allow the  design and power of subsequent definitive multicenter, 
randomized, controlled clinical trials.  The primary hypothes es are that percutaneous peripheral 
nerve stimulation decreases pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_468073] 5 days following moderate -to-severely  
painful surgical procedures  currently treated with a single -injection peripheral nerve block .

9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
This will be a single -center (UCSD), randomized, participant - and observer -masked , sham -controlled, 
parallel -arm human participant s pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] . 
 
Enrollment.  Participants will be consenting adults  undergoing various surgical procedures usually 
resulting in moderate -to-severe postoperative pain and treated with single -injection peripheral nerve 
blocks .  Study inclusion will be proposed to eligible patients prior to surgery.  If a patient desires 
study participation, written, informed consent will be obtained using a current UCSD IRB -approved 
ICF.  The study population of interest includes wo men and men of all races , ethnicity, sexual identity,  
and socioeconomic status.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in section #[ADDRESS_1022593] baseline 
anthropometric information (age, sex, height, weight , current pain level ).  Participants will have their 
single -injection peripheral nerve block administered using ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
(standard at UCSD) prior to undergoing their surgical procedure  per standard of care .  A “successful” 
regional block will be defined as sensory - and motor -block onset in all expected nerve distributions 
within the 30 minutes fo llowing the local anesthetic injection.   Participants with a successful regional 
block and undergo the anticipated surgical procedure will be randomized and continue within the 
study.  
 
Treatment Group Assignment.  Each participant  will be randomized to one of two treatment groups:  
Active (Experimental) or Sham treatment.  There are sham devices produced that are identical to 
active devices, only they do not deliver electrical current.  Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_747377] , in block sizes of 2.  The computer -generated randomization list will be created by [CONTACT_747378] a 1:1 treatment group ratio using 
opaque envelopes opened only after successful peripheral nerve block administration  and the 
participant underwent the anticipated su rgical procedure .  The active and sham stimulators are 
indistinguishable in appearance, and therefore investigators, participants , and all clinical staff other 
than the individual who opens the randomization envelope and chooses a sham or active device will 
be masked to treatment group assignment for the duration of the data collection period . 
 
Study intervention.   The NSS -2 Bridge device will be affixed to the ear and activated prior to 
discharge from the recovery room  (Experimental) .  There is currently no consensus regarding the 
placement on the ipsilateral or contralateral ear relative to the surgical procedure (if sided).  
Therefore, we will apply the device to the side that the participant sleeps on least, to optimize comfort 
in bed and sleep.  
 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_1022594] -of-care oral  and intravenous postoperative analgesics  which 
can include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (this is surgeon - and patient -
dependent) .  Therefore, all patients of this study —regardless of the treatment arm they are 
randomized to —will continue to receive current usual and customary analgesia :  all will receive the 
same combination of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and a single -injection peripheral 
nerve  block as they would regardless of study participation.   Prior to discharge, participant s and their 
caretakers will be provided with verbal instructions  regarding  the care of the stimulator , and the 
telephone and pager numbers of a n investigator available at all times  during the first 5 days of 
treatment .  The instructions for the stimulator are few:  (1) you can shower, but use a shower cap to 
cover the stimulator; (2) there are no controls so there is nothing that needs to be adjusted; (3) the 
device will run out of power after 5 days; (4) we will call you  every day to answer any questions you 
might have and describe how to remove the device as that time approache s. 
 
Participants will be discharged when ready, as determined by [CONTACT_747379].  Participants  will be discharged home with their NSS-2 Bridge  in situ  and a 
prescription for immediate -release oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], preferably oxycodone 5 mg tablets , taken for 
breakthrough pain.  Participants will be contact[CONTACT_747380] 1.  The NSS -2 Bridge devices will be removed by [CONTACT_747381] 5.  Similar to perineural catheters,135 this procedure encompasses simply 
removing the small  dressing s (the electrodes remain adhered to the dressings and therefore do not 
require a separate  extraction step) , removing the stimulator from behind the ear with simple traction, 
and discarding all components (these are disposable, single -use devices).  
 
At the conclusion of the study, participants will be informed of the main  results in lay -person language 
by [CONTACT_747382] U.S. Postal Service.  
 
 
Outcome measurements (end points).   We have selected outcome measures that have 
established reliability and validity, with minimal inter -rater discordance, and are recommended for 
pain-related clinical trials by [CONTACT_7902], Measurement, and Pain Assessment in 
Clinical Trials  (IMMPACT) consensus statement.  All data collection will be through standard UCSD 
nursing/therapy EPIC notes and patient interviews in -person during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174055] a telephone 
call.  Postoperatively, surgical endpoints will be recorded such as sur gical duration  and tourniquet 
duration (if applicable).   All pain scores will be measured using the Numeric Rating Scale  (0: no pain, 
10: worst imaginable pain) . 
 
 
Primary end  point s:  This is a n exploratory  pi[INVESTIGATOR_747361] a subsequent definitive 
trial and we therefore have no data analysis plan .  The two primary outcome s will be (1) the mean of 
the “average” pain recorded on postoperative day s 1-5 measured with the Numeric Rating Scale 
(“average” pain is included in the Brief Pain Inventory pain domain ); and (2) the cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_747362] 5, as measured in oral oxycodone 
equivalents .

11. RECRUITMENT AND PROCEDURES PREPARATORY TO RESEARCH  
The investigators will need to know in advance which patients would like to participate in order to 
have an investigator and research coordinator present on the day of  surgery.  The investigators 
therefore need to contact [CONTACT_616370] s prior to their pre -surgery visit and request a waiver of 
consent for recruitment purposes.  We will scan the upcoming surgery schedule (which we have 
access to being anesthesiologists —we use this schedule daily for medical purposes), identify 
patients ha ving the type s of surgical procedures specified for this study, look in their electronic 
records to determine eligibility, and if eligible either call the potential participant s ourselves or provide 
the name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_10975] a research coordinator to contact [CONTACT_52764] s. 
 
1.  These procedures are minimal risk to the potential participant s as we are anesthesiologists who 
will be viewing these records even without study participation in preparation for surgery and 
postoperative analgesia planning.  There is no information that an anesthesiologist would not view 
regardless of the existence o f the study.  
 
2.  A waiver of consent would not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the potential participant s 
as we are anesthesiologists who will be viewing these records even without study participation in 
preparation for surgery and postoperative analgesia planning.  There is no information that an 
anesthesiologist would not view regardless of the existence o f the study.  
 
3.  This clinical trial could not be practicably carried out without the waiver because many relatively 
healthy ambulatory patients are not seen in preop clinic; or, they are seen just [ADDRESS_1022596] a partial waiver of HIPAA 
authorization to be granted:  
 
1.  Identifiers will include the potential participant ’s date of surgery, surgeon, name, phone number, 
and email address (to send ICF if patient is interested in participation).  This information will be 
recorded in hard -copy format and destroyed using a paper shredder (or in the locked UCSD PHI 
disposal stat ions) following contact [CONTACT_10970].  If the patient does not participate, then there will 
be no record of PHI whatsoever.  If the patient does participate, then PHI will be protected as 
described in #16 below.  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 9  
2.  This clinical trial could not be practicably carried out without the waiver because many relatively 
healthy ambulatory patients are not seen in preop clinic; or, they are seen just [ADDRESS_1022597] baseline measurements.  
 
3.  The privacy risk to individuals whose PHI will be used is minimal since, as anesthesiologists at 
UCSD caring for ambulatory surgery patients, we use the surgery schedule daily in the normal 
course of our work caring for patients ; and we will not record any PHI other than date of surgery, 
surgeon, name, contact [CONTACT_32080], and email address —and, these will be destroyed following 
use.  The anticipated benefit to participant s is a chance of improving their postoperative pain control 
if they are randomiz ed to active stimulation.  
 
4.  PHI that will be used includes date of surgery, surgeon, name, contact [CONTACT_32080], email 
address, basic anthropometric data such as height and weight, past medical and surgical history, and 
the surgical schedule itself.  Only coinvestigators will ac cess this PHI, and the only people they might 
share it with are research coordinators actively participating in this research who understand PHI 
procedures and to appropriately destroy the hard copy of date/surgeon/name/contact [CONTACT_15750]/email 
address after use. 
 
Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be presented with the study, and prospective 
study participant s desiring additional information will be required to give permission for a research 
coordinator to contact [CONTACT_174081].  The study protocol will be reviewed 
with interested prospective participant s in detail ; and for participant s desiring participation, written, 
informed consent will be obtained prior to any measurements, data collection, and/or interventions.  
The method of documenting consent will be using written informed consent forms approved by [CONTACT_174082].  
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Candidates who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and desire study enrollment will be scheduled 
to arrive the day of surgery 15 minutes earlier than normal to allow for written informed consent and 
baseline information collection .  Written informed consent will be attained prior to any measurements 
or procedures prior to surgery.  When participant s present for surgery, research coordinators will 
provide and attain written informed consent.  This will occur in private patient care areas, so that 
participa nts may feel comfortable asking questions of the research coordinator . 
We do not foresee any issues relevant to the mental capacity of the potential human participant s.  
Written, informed consent will be attained prior to any study procedures or measurements; and 
participant s will not receive procedure -related sedation until following the written, informed consent 
process is completed.  Participant s will be provided privacy and time for decision making both in the 
study description/explanation telephone call to an investigator  or research coordinator, as described 
above; and a lso the morning of the initial treatment using a private patient care area to again review 
the study, informed consent form, and answer any remaining questions.  As noted previously, 
participant s may speak with an investigator by [CONTACT_747383] 10 treatment ; and will have access during and following the treatment(s) with cellular phone and pager 
numbers provided upon discharge.  
This study protocol has follow -up data -collection telephone calls a maximum of 8 days  following the 
initial study treatment, so repeated informed consent following the initial consent is unnecessary, as 
opposed to multi -year, longer -term clinical trials.  Surrogate consent will not be accepted; therefore, if 
human participant s cannot provide consent on their own, they will not be offered study enrollment.  
Consent by [CONTACT_28045]’s Legally Authorized Representative is unac ceptable for study enrollment.  
Following informed consent and the signing of the UCSD IRB -approved ICF and HIPAA documents, 
these documents will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530],  and the copy placed in the patient’s medical record.  The participant  
will be provide d a copy along with the Participant s’ Bill of Rights.  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
Patients can decline enrollment.  If they do so, they will still receive the standard -of-care 
postoperative analgesia.  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
Potential risks include minor bleeding at the skin (0.9%), dermatitis (0.9%), and significant pain 
during placement ( less than 0.1%).  In addition, there is the risk of infection and loss of confidentiality.  
The following study procedures will be done to maintain confidentiality of this study:  hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_174059]’s files.  Any digitized 
records containing personal health information will be stored as password -protected and encrypted 
files. 
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
The procedural risks involved with the intervention  will be managed according to the complication : 
 
- minor bleeding at the skin (0.9%):  pressure would be held until bleeding ceased  
- dermatitis (0.9%):  the device would be removed  
- significant pain during placement ( far less than 0.1 7%):  The participant could opt to not have it 
placed and be removed from study participation  
- infection (theoretical:  none reported to date):  We would remove the device and possibly prescribe 
oral antibiotics, depending on the severity of the infection.  
 
During use, placement of the device may restrict some normal activities such as bathing and 
brushing/arranging hair.  While the device is water resistant, participants will be verbally instructed to  
avoid submerging it and should use a shower cap when showering.  The small wires could get pulled

the device on whichever ear participants  prefer, it may be less comfortable sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_747365] a participant  sleep s on both sides during the night.  
 
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT  
We request a partial waiver of HIPAA authorization to be granted as explained above in section #11.  
Identifiers will include the potential participant’s date of surgery, surgeon, name, phone number, and 
email address (to send ICF if patient is interested in participation).  This information will be recorded 
in hard -copy format and destroyed using a paper  shredder (or in the locked UCSD PHI disposal 
stations) following contact [CONTACT_10970].  If the patient does not participate, then there will be no 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_1022598] of PHI whatsoever.  If the patient does participate, then PHI will be protected as described 
below:  
 
The following study procedures will be done to maintain confidentiality of this study:  hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_86650] a locked medical office. Only the investigators will have access to the records.  Any 
electronic records with patient identifiers will be password protected according to UCSD IT 
recommendations and policies.  No patient identifiers will be used in reporting data from the study.  
Every effort will be made to assure protection of patient privacy.  
 
This study will require access to the medical record of patients who have consented to participate as 
participant s.  The privacy of these patients will be protected in the manner described below:  
1. Specific consent will be obtained from each patient to permit examination of his or her medical 
record.  
2. Information obtained during the study will be de -identified with study specific identifiers that do 
not permit recognition of any participant s’ personal information.  
3. All information gathered will be stored in a locked cabinet which is inside a locked room which 
will be accessible only to registered study investigators.   
4. Any data gathered stored on portable electronic media (e.g. flash drives) will be stored in this 
cabinet when not in use.  
5. Any digitized records will be stored in encrypted files on password -protected computers.  
6. No photographs will be taken.  
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Participants may or may not receive these benefits:  decreased pain , opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], sleep 
disturbances, and pain-induced physical and emotional dysfunction . 
 
Possible benefits to others:  Future patients may benefit if it is determined that auricular 
neuromodulation  decreases the incidence and severity of pain following moderately painful surgeries , 
as well as exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_747366]. Finding an effective non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_747367] a tremendous step forward in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_174063] . 
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
While there are risks involved in the placement and use of the NSS -2 Bridge devices , they are 
relatively rare and not catastrophic when they do occur.  With its ease of insertion, low risk of adverse 
events, lack of side effects, prolonged duration of action, and simple removal, auricular 
neuromodulation has the very real possibility of replacing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] —the standard of care for 
the past 100 yea rs—that would completely revolutionize postoperative analgesia, as we know it.  
 
19. EXPENSE TO PARTICIPANT  
None  
 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
None  
 
21. PRIVILEGES/CERTIFICATIONS/LICENSES AND RESEARCH TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES

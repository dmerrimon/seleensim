2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Risankizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobin G1 subclass 
directed towards interleukin (IL)-23p19.  The antibody has been engineered to reduce Fc γ receptor and 
complement binding and potential charge heterogeneity.  Risankizumab binds with high affinity to human IL-23.
Positive results were observed from [ADDRESS_1228954] a 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and static physician global assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) versus comparator or placebo at Week 16 across all 4 studies.
1
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 clinical trials, the risankizumab 150-mg dose was administered with a 90-mg/mL formulation via 2 subcutaneous (SC) 75-mg injections.  To deliver a more patient-friendly experience, a new formulation was developed at 150 mg/mL that will enable delivery of the 150 mg dose with one SC injection.  This study will evaluate the risankizumab 150-mg/mL formulation self-administered by [CONTACT_879629] (150 mg dose at Week 0, Week 4, and every 12 weeks 
thereafter) as used in the Phase [ADDRESS_1228955] will be performed.  Summary data will be used to evaluate usability.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
In Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of risankizumab in patients with psoriasis, the majority of subjects receiving risankizumab achieved 90% improvement of their disease, and risankizumab was well tolerated.  As with many immune modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function resulting in a risk of infection.  This will be monitored by [CONTACT_82644] (AEs) during the treatment and observation periods.  In addition, subjects with active infection will not be included in thestudy.
Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON®-test or a positive purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) skin test for 
tuberculosis (TB) must fulfill entry criteria as specified in Section 5.1of this protocol.  Interleukin-[ADDRESS_1228956] been no cases of active TB, including no reactivation of TB in subjects 
diagnosed with latent TB, across the entire risankizumab development program.  Across the Phase 3 psoriasis clinical studies, of the 72 subjects with latent TB who were concurrently treated with risankizumab and appropriate TB prophylaxis during the study, none developed active TB during a mean 
  
STUDY M16-005  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_1228957] of IL-23 p19 inhibition in animal models, both for pre-existing and tumor-induction models.  However, there is not enough clinical information at this time to rule out a risk of cancer with risankizumab, but this risk is considered small.
Although rare, a potential for hepatic adverse events is under constant surveillance by [CONTACT_405735].  Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety.
Increases in major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) events including myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death, reported initially with anti-IL-12/[ADDRESS_1228958] not been observed in longer term studies.  While the likelihood of increased MACE is small, all suspected cardiovascular events (serious or nonserious) observed in this study will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_329103].  An independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) will adjudicate all observed cardio- and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.2).
Injection-site reactions to biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_879628], swelling, or induration at the injection site.  Manifestations of anaphylaxis may include pruritus, hypotension, swollen lips and tongue, abdominal pain, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  Both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis are readily detectable, transient in nature, and manageable with standard medical 
treatment.  Subjects will be closely monitored on site during study drug administration at Weeks [ADDRESS_1228959] dose and 1 hour postdose at Week 28.  Subjects will be given instructions regarding management of signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis to be followed during home dosing at Weeks 4 and 16.  An independent Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate suspected anaphylactic reactions.  The AAC will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.3).
In conclusion, the benefit-risk profile of risankizumab is considered appropriate for this stage of clinical development.  Based on data from the integrated safety analyses, risankizumab is safe and well tolerated and demonstrates a favorable benefit-risk profile.  For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the risankizumab Investigator Brochure.

STUDY M16-005  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_1228960] of risankizumab in 
an AI, as well as to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of risankizumab administered by [CONTACT_879630].
3.2 Key Study Endpoints
The following key endpoints will be evaluated:
•Proportion of subjects with an Observer rating of successful subject self-administration, defined as any subjects who successfully completed the sequence of 4 critical steps in the Instructions for Use (IFU) without errors to administer study drug via the AI at Week 0 and 28
•Proportion of subjects achieving at least 90% improvement from baseline in PASI (PASI 90) at Week 16
•Proportion of subjects achieving sPGA clear or almost clear at Week 16
•Proportion of subjects achieving 100% improvement from baseline in PASI (PASI 100) at Week 16

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].•A repeat of all screening procedures is needed at this repeat Screening Visit with these 
exceptions:
•If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation, including the assessment of an 
Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON Tuberculosis [TB] Gold In Tube test) or a [COMPANY_003] test (or equivalent), and electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated at the repeat Screening Visit.
•There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait prior to the repeat Screening Visit.
Subjects will be instructed at Week 0 (pre-injection) by [CONTACT_879632]-inject via the AI.  Self-injections will be administered into one of the following body regions, changing the injection site if possible at each time point:  right thigh, left thigh, right abdominal area, left abdominal area.
At Week 0 (after training) and Week 28, subjects will be instructed by [CONTACT_879633] (refer 
to Appendix E of the Operations Manual) and proceed with self-injection.  At the Week [ADDRESS_1228963] in the context of an observed assessment under the supervision of one site staff member.  Each assessment is to be conducted on a 1:1 basis.  The observer (site staff member) will measure and evaluate the subject's usability of the AI using the self-injection assessmentchecklist as they observe the injections at Week [ADDRESS_1228964] (refer to 
Appendix G of the Operations Manual) for self-injections at Week [ADDRESS_1228965] to pause, to point out the use error, and to decide whether to terminate the self-injection.  If the observing site staff member's judgment the self-injection can continue, they should correct the subject's usage of the product and notify the subject to recommence at the same point.  These errors will be documented from the list of potential use-related hazards.  Any risk of a health and safety incident could result in termination of the self-injection at the discretion of the observing site staff member.
Subject-derived usability assessment measures acceptability of the AI using the SIAQ.  Subjects will fill 
out the SIAQ PRE module (refer to Appendix B of the Operations Manual) immediately before the first self-injection at Week [ADDRESS_1228966]'s self-rated assessment of each item of the SIAQ, will be transformed during analysis to scores ranging from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience) as described in Appendix B of the Operations Manual.
At Week 0, after the subject self-injects, the site will collect the used AI and examine them for technical 
performance.  The site will document the result in the appropriate eCRF.
See Section 5for information regarding eligibility criteria.
  
STUDY M16-005  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_1228967] and generally accepted.
The SIAQ evaluates patients' experiences with self-injection and enables assessment of their success in 
giving self-injections and the likelihood of them adhering to a self-injection regimen.
[ADDRESS_1228968] moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, defined as a PASI score ≥ 12, body surface area 
(BSA) involvement ≥ 10%, and sPGA ≥ 3 who are candidates for systemic therapy are eligible for this 
study.  Criteria such as laboratory values (minimums and maximums) and subject history (absence of chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis B or C [HBV, HCV]), and other exclusions are specified to ensure subject safety and to allow adequate evaluation of the study drug.  The study population selected reflects a standard population for moderate to severe psoriasis trials with new treatment intervention.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The risankizumab dosing regimen selected for the current study is the same as used in the risankizumab pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  Risankizumab has been found to be safe and well tolerated with no dose limiting safety findings following single- or multiple-dose administration at doses up to  mg SC or 1800 mg intravenously in Phase 1 to 3 clinical studies.

Blinded Efficacy Assessor
A qualified physician (may be a non-dermatologist) or designee (may be a non-physician) from the site will be responsible for performing the efficacy assessments, including PASI, BSA, and sPGA at all appropriate study visits ( Table 1 ).  The site will make every attempt to have the same qualified physician 
or designee perform these assessments throughout the study for each subject.  The efficacy assessor must remain blinded to patient's treatment, clinical laboratory results, and all subject safety data during 
  
STUDY M16-005  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_1228969] specific safety data 
with the investigators or any other site personnel, with the exception of the dermatologic safety findings 
requiring urgent medical attention.  The efficacy assessor therefore cannot be the Principal Investigator.  The efficacy assessor will not access patient's electronic case report form (eCRF) and will document the dermatologic assessments and potential dermatologic safety findings on paper worksheets that will be filed as source in the patient's record.  It is recommended that each study site has a designated back-up for the efficacy assessor.

An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the 
use of the product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a 
routine basis throughout the study.  All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
  
STUDY M16-005  |  Version 3.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse 
event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the 
surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
If an adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is 
to be reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (CRO) (as appropriate) as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_1228985] information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26182]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
  
STUDY M16-005  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_1228986] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 20 weeks (140 days) after discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  In addition, serious adverse events and protocol-related nonserious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signs the study-specific informed consent.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
If AEs in any of the following areas of safety interest (ASI) are reported during the study, then the 
corresponding supplemental report must be completed ( Table 3 ).

•Grade 5 (Severe); Death related to AE.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the 
use of study drug:
Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an adverse event, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1228987] be discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the 
pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event.
6.2 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee
An independent adjudication committee will be adjudicating all observed cardio- and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation.  The events that are adjudicated and the 
adjudication process will be detailed in the CAC Adjudication Committee Charter.  Dedicated eCRFs will 
be used as outlined in Table 3 .
In addition, the site may be contact[CONTACT_82656].
6.3 Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC)
While no concerns with systemic hypersensitivity have been identified with the use of risankizumab, the sponsor has established an independent, blinded, expert committee to adjudicate events of anaphylaxis based on pre-specified definitions.  This independent external Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate suspected anaphylactic reactions and will remain blinded to treatment allocation.  The event terms to be adjudicated and the adjudication process are detailed in the AAC Charter.  A supplemental Hypersensitivity Reactions eCRF will be used to collect information pertinent to the events (Table 3 ).  In addition, the site may be contact[CONTACT_843086].
If a suspected systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurs at the investigative site, subjects should be tested for tryptase and histamine levels.  If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis is

For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring duringthe study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The intent-to-treat (ITT) Population, which is defined as all subjects who have at least one dose of study drug in Study M16-005, will be used for the efficacy and usability analyses.  The Safety Population, which is defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug in Study M16-005, will be used for all safety analyses.  In this study, the safety population is the same as the ITT population.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
All summary statistics for the efficacy analysis will be conducted in the ITT Population.  No statistical tests will be performed.
Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) will be used for categorical endpoints.  Mixed-effect Model Repeat 
Measurements (MMRM) will be used for continuous endpoints.
Details on the efficacy analyses are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
Sample Size Estimation
This study is designed to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_1228989] at Weeks 0, 4, 16, and 28.
  
STUDY M16-005  |  Version 3.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Assuming the point estimate is 90% for the proportion of subjects with an observer rating of successful 
subject self-administration at Week 28, the current sample size of 100 subjects will provide a 
95% confidence interval of ± 5.9% around a point estimate.
In addition, assuming comparable response rates as the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], with the current sample 
size of 100, the PASI 90 rate at Week 16 can be estimated with a 95% confidence interval of ± 8.6% 
when the point estimate is 74%; and the sPGA of clear or almost clear rate at Week 16 can be estimated with a 95% confidence interval of ± 7.0% when the point estimate is 85%.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Populations.  A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an event with onset or worsening after the first dose of study drug and within 20 weeks (140 days) after the last dose of study drug.  The number and percentage of subjects 
experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_82662].  Summaries (including percentages and events per 100 PYs) of SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be provided as well.  Pre-treatment AEs will be summarized separately.  For selected laboratory parameters, a listing of all subjects with any laboratory value that is above Grade 3 of Common Toxicity Criteria will be provided.  Mean change in laboratory and vital signs variables will be summarized.  Additional details for the safety analysis are provided in the SAP.
7.5 Study Interim Analysis
An interim analysis will occur after all ongoing subjects complete the Week 28 Visit.

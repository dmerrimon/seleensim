Background:
The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes is critical for maintaining 
genomic stability by [CONTACT_52361] a variety of DNA damage repair mechanisms.
Talazoparib (BMN 673) is a PARP inhibitor with greater in vitro activity than any other PARP 
inhibitor currently in development.  Talazoparib (BMN 673) has been shown to cause single-
agent synthetic lethality in BRCA1/2- and PTEN-deficient cell lines, and has potent antitumor 
activity in animal models of tumors harboring mutations in DNA repair pathways.  
Talazoparib (BMN 673) is showing promising single-agent activity in patients with advanced 
ovarian and breast cancer harboring deleterious BRCA mutations. 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_52333] (BMN 673) on DNA 
damage and apoptosis markers in tumor biopsy tissue. 
Primary Objective:
Determine the pharmacodynamic effect of talazoparib (BMN 673) in tumor biopsies from 
patients with advanced ovarian, breast, or other solid tumor and deleterious BRCA mutations.
Secondary Objectives:
Determine the response rate (CR + PR) of treatment with talazoparib (BMN 673) in patients with 
deleterious BRCA mutations.
Eligibility:
Adult patients with documented deleterious BRCA [ADDRESS_55501] treatment options.
No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within [ADDRESS_55502] eligibility levels.
Age ≥18 years of age; ECOG performance status ≤ 2
Adequate organ function.
Willingness to undergo tumor biopsies.
Study Design:
Talazoparib (BMN 673) will be administered orally each day in 28-day cycles.  
Dosing will be at the established recommended Phase II dose of 1000 μg/day each day for 
28 days.
To meet the primary, pharmacodynamic endpoint of the trial, we plan to accrue a total of 12 
patients with matched, evaluable baseline and day 8 biopsies.  To allow for some patients whose 
biopsies will not be evaluable (i.e., will contain <5% tumor content), the accrual ceiling is 24 
patients.  The number of patients evaluable for objective response, while relevant to the 
secondary objective of the trial, will not be considered in determining completion of accrual.
Tumor biopsies will be mandatory at baseline (pre-dose), and then approximately 3-[ADDRESS_55503] 
talazoparib (BMN 673) on day 8.  One optional tumor biopsy may also be collected either on day 
1 ( 2 days) of the cycle following any restaging at which a 10-19% increase in tumor volume is 
observed (according to RECIST criteria) if the patient has been on study for at least 4 cycles, or 
at time of disease progression.

61 OBJECTIVES
Primary Objective:
Determine the pharmacodynamic effect of talazoparib (BMN 673) in tumor biopsies from 
patients with advanced ovarian, breast, or other solid tumor and deleterious BRCA 
mutations.
Secondary Objective:
Determine the response rate (CR + PR) of treatment with talazoparib (BMN 673) in 
patients with deleterious BRCA mutations.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Poly-ADP-ribosylation
Poly-ADP-ribosylation occurs after single- or double-stranded DNA damage and represents 
the posttranslational modification of histones and other nuclear proteins by [CONTACT_52362] (ADP-
ribose) polymerase (PARP) [ 1].  PARP has been implicated in many cellular processes, 
including replication, transcription, differentiation, gene regulation, protein degradation, 
and mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_52334].  Enhanced PARP-1 expression and/or activity in tumor 
cells, as compared to normal cells, has been demonstrated in malignant lymphomas [ 2], 
hepatocellular carcinoma [ 3], cervical carcinoma [ 4], colorectal carcinoma [ 5], non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma [ 6], leukemic lymphocytes [ 7], and colon adenomatous polyps [ 8].  
In knockout mouse models, deletion of PARP-1 is sufficient to impair DNA repair [ 9-11].  
The residual PARP-dependent repair activity (~ 10%) is due to PARP-2.  This suggests that 
only PARP-1 and PARP-2 need to be inhibited to impair DNA repair [ 12-14].
Poly-ADP-ribosylation of proteins is a dynamic process with a short half-life (t1/2) of 
<1 min.  The enzymes responsible for degrading these polymers are poly (ADP-ribose) 
glycohydrolase (PARG), which cleaves ribose-ribose bonds, and ADP-ribosyl protein 
lyase, which removes the protein proximal to the ADP-ribose monomer.
Increased PARP activity is one of the mechanisms by [CONTACT_52363].  PARP activity is essential for the repair of single-
stranded DNA breaks through the base excision repair (BER) pathways [ 14, 15].  
Therefore, inhibition of PARP sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic agents (e.g., alkylators 
(temozolomide, cyclophosphamide, BCNU) and topoisomerase I inhibitors (e.g., 
irinotecan, camptothecin, topotecan) that induce DNA damage that would normally be 
repaired through the BER system.  Double-stranded breaks are strong activators of 
PARP-1, resulting in PARP-1–mediated activation of DNA-PK and Ku80, important 
components of the non-homologous end-joining double-stranded break repair pathway [ 16, 
17].  Small molecule inhibitors of PARP directly inhibit repair of double-stranded breaks 
[9, 18].
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-[ADDRESS_55515] some BRCA-
deficient cells in the absence of any DNA damaging agent [ 19-21].  It is possible that, in 
BRCA-deficient cells, PARP inhibition stops the BER pathway, and thus, single-stranded 
breaks are carried through DNA synthesis, resulting in double-stranded breaks.  The 
increase in double-stranded breaks cannot be repaired by [CONTACT_10579], due 
to the lack of BRCA1 or 2, resulting in increased cell death. 
BRCA1-/- and 2 -/- embryonic stem cells were observed to be extremely sensitive to PARP 
inhibition (Figure 1) [ 20].  This might be due to inhibition of the BER pathway by [CONTACT_52364]-deficient 
cancer cells (Figure 2) [ 21, 22].
Figure 1: Inhibition of PARP activity inhibits the survival of cells lacking wild-type 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 after 10-12 days of continuous exposure to PARP inhibitor [ 20].  

CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
8Figure 2: Inhibition of PARP in tumor cells with BRCA mutations leads to persistence of 
DNA lesions normally repaired by [CONTACT_10579] [ 21].
These observations led to the evaluation of single-agent PARP inhibitors in patients with 
deleterious BRCA mutations [ 23].  Results from recent Phase II studies of single-agent 
olaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor, in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer or refractory 
breast cancer and confirmed BRCA1 or 2 mutations are encouraging.  Confirmed overall 
response rates for patients with ovarian cancer treated with 400 or 100 mg two times a day 
(BID) of olaparib were 33% and 13%, respectively; a further 33% and 29% of patients 
experienced stable disease.  It is also worth noting that median progression-free survival 
(PFS) in these two cohorts was 5.8 and 1.9 months, respectively [ 24].  For the companion 
trial of olaparib in patients with deleterious BRCA mutations and breast cancer, the 
objective response rate was 38% (9/24) on the 400 mg BID dose (41% [11/27] in the 
investigator’s presentation to ASCO 2009) [ 25].  These data support the hypothesis that 
BRCA-deficient cancer cells are sensitive to PARP inhibition.  
2.2 Talazoparib (BMN 673)
Mechanism of Action
Talazoparib (BMN 673) has been shown to be a highly selective and potent cytotoxic agent 
in human cancer cell lines and in animal models of tumors harboring mutations that 
compromise DNA repair pathways.  Talazoparib (BMN 673) inhibits PARP in vitro at a 
lower concentration 
(IC 50= 0.57 nM) than the PARP inhibitors ABT 888 (IC 50=4.73 nM), AG14447 (IC 50=1.98 
nM), or olaparib (IC 50=1.94 nM) [ 26, 27].
Pharmacodynamic Studies
IC50 values for the inhibition of recombinant human PARP-1 enzymatic activity are 
approximately the same for the talazoparib tosylate salt (BMN 673ts) and freebase forms 
(BMN 673fb) (0.83 and 1.2 nM, respectively), indicating that the tosylate salt does not 
affect mechanism of action of BMN 673fb.  In contrast, the enantiomeric isomer (LT-
[ZIP_CODE]) is a poor inhibitor of PARP-1 enzymatic activity (IC50>100 nM).  BMN 673fb 
inhibited PARP-2 to a comparable extent as its inhibition of PARP-1.
Assessment of BMN 673fb and related compounds for their tumor cell cytotoxicity 
revealed selective and potent cytotoxicity in human cancer cell lines harboring mutations 
that compromise DNA repair pathways.  Gene mutations that confer selective tumor cell 
cytotoxicity included BRCA1 (MX-1 mammary tumor cells), BRCA2 (Capan-1 pancreatic 
tumor cells), PTEN (MDA-MB-468 mammary, LNCap and PC-3 prostate tumor cells), and 
MLH-1 mutations (HCT-116 colorectal tumor cells) (Table 1).  The IC50 values of BMN 
673fb in these tumor cell lines were in the single-digit nanomolar or sub-nanomolar range.  
In contrast, the IC50 of talazoparib (BMN 673) against normal human primary cell MRC-[ADDRESS_55516] reported DNA repair-related mutations are 
significantly greater (250 nM to > 1000 nM).

Table 1.  The cytotoxicity of talazoparib (BMN 673) and reference PARP inhibitors was 
compared in normal human cells (MRC-5) or in tumor cells that either wild-type for 
BRCA‐1/BRCA‐2 (SW620, MB231), deficient in BRCA‐1 (MX‐1), or BRCA‐2 (Capan‐1).  
Cells were seeded in their recommended growth medium and allowed to grow overnight at 
37°C, then incubated in media containing increasing concentrations of PARP inhibitors for 
12-14 days.  
In the BRCA1-deficient MX-1 xenograft tumor model, oral administration of 0.33 mg/kg
BMN 673fb once daily for 28 days resulted in significant antitumor activity (tumor growth 
delay/tumor regression; Figure 3).  Dose-related inhibition of tumor growth was observed 
at lower doses, while a higher dose (1.0 mg/kg/day) induced significant body weight loss 
with associated mortality.  Consistent with the antitumor effect, profound reduction in poly 
(ADP-ribose) (PAR) level (a measure of PARP activity) was observed in MX-1 xenografts 
following oral administration.  Complete suppression of BRCA1-deficient tumor growth 
was achieved in a 3-month study dosed at 0.165 mg/kg/BID [ 26].  Oral administration 
(0.33 mg/kg/day for 28 days) also resulted in antitumor activity in the PTEN-deficient 
LNCap, MDA-MB-468, and PC-3 xenograft models [ 26].  In addition, BID oral 
administration of BMN 673fb (0.33 mg/kg/day for 28 days) delayed the growth of the 
MLH-1–deficient HCT-116 xenograft tumor in nude mice.

10and 84% PBS) was administered orally once daily for 28 consecutive days beginning Day 1 
(n=6).  Purple straight line indicates the daily dosing period.  P-value compares each 
treatment group with the vehicle only group.
Assessment of various dosing schedules in the mouse xenograft models indicated that 
continuous daily administration of BMN 673fb resulted in greater antitumor activity than 
intermittent administration at the same or higher dose levels (Figure 4).  BID dosing 
resulted in extended tumor growth delay or extended tumor regression compared to single 
daily (QD) dosing at an identical total daily dose level for 28-days.  These results suggest 
that continuous suppression of PARP activity is required for optimal antitumor activity.

Pharmacokinetic Studies
Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in rats and dogs.  BMN 673ts (tosylate salt) was 
selected as the dosing form by [CONTACT_52365] 3 dogs; thereafter, all GLP pharmacokinetic and toxicology/TK studies used the salt 
form for oral and IV administration.  The oral formulation used in the GLP studies was a 
suspension in CMC (0.5% w/v).  The clinical presentation and formulation developed for 
the Phase 1 studies is a HPMC capsule containing BMN 673ts in a dry powder blend (25, 
50, 250 and 1000 μg free base equivalents/capsule.  A GLP bridging study compared the 
PK and bioavailability of the suspension and capsule in male and female dogs using the 
250-μg capsule.  BMN 673ts’ relative bioavailability following capsule administration 
compared to the suspension was 185% and 212% for males and females, respectively; for 
males and females combined, 197%.
Oral bioavailability, calculated from the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve 
(AUC) following oral administration relative to the AUC following intravenous (IV) 
administration (AUC oral/AUC IV), was > 42.7% in rats and > 50.5% in dogs based on single 
dose comparisons.  The compound was metabolically stable.  The terminal half-life (t½) of 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
11talazoparib (BMN 673) at various doses in rats and dogs ranges from 28.5 to 32.0 hour and 
69.7 to 91.2 hour, respectively, which allows for once daily dosing.  Steady state 
concentrations were reached on Day 15 in rats and on Day 20 in dogs using daily 
administration of talazoparib (BMN 673).  Comparing Day 15 and 28 with Day 1 for all 
dose levels in dogs, AUC and C max increased from Day 1 to Day 15 to Day 28. 
 
Preclinical Studies
Five-day repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) studies with 28-day recovery were 
conducted in rats and dogs.  In dogs (the most sensitive species), talazoparib (BMN 673) 
was administered at dosage levels of 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 mg/kg/day over [ADDRESS_55517] dose groups 
(0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg/day).  At these doses, the mean reticulocyte nadir occurred on day 6 
and the platelet and WBC nadirs on day 11.  These changes were reversed in the group 
treated at 0.03 mg/kg/day on days 17-18 (i.e., 12-[ADDRESS_55518] dose of the drug).  In 
contrast, some animals in the group treated at 0.1 mg/kg/day died due to bacterial 
septicemia associated with bone marrow hypocellularity and lymphoid organ depletion.  
Remaining animals in this dose group were euthanized due to hypoactivity, hyperthermia, 
hypersalivation, and/or fecal abnormalities on day 12-13.  Coagulation parameters were 
unaffected.  After repeat-dose administration of daily oral talazoparib (BMN 673) in dogs 
for 5-days, the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was 0.03 mg/kg/day.
Twenty-eight day repeat dose toxicity and TK studies with 28-day recovery were also 
conducted in rats and dogs.  In dogs (the most sensitive species), talazoparib (BMN 673) 
was administered at dosage levels of 0.0005, 0.0015, 0.005, 0.01 mg/kg/day over 28 
consecutive days.  Talazoparib related signs included hematology findings in males and 
females given 0.005 or 0.01 mg/kg/day such as mildly lower red cell mass, mildly to 
moderately lower platelet and absolute reticulocyte counts, and minimally to mildly lower 
white blood cell counts with a generalized decrease in all leukocytes.  All of these signs 
reversed or were reversing by [CONTACT_52366].  After repeat-dose 
administration of daily oral talazoparib (BMN 673) in dog for 28 days, the HNSTD was 
0.01 mg/kg/day.
The main nonclinical dose-related findings were changes in reticulocytes, platelet, white 
and red blood cell counts in repeat dose studies in rat and dog that were indicative of bone 
marrow hypocellularity and lymphoid tissue depletion.  Findings of increased cellular 
turnover in the gastrointestinal system and focal necrosis of the liver, testes, and ovary 
were dose related in severity and incidence.  BMN 673ts related mortalities were dose 
related, categorized as secondary toxicity and were due to either 1) septicemia secondary to 
bone marrow and lymphoid organ depletion (rat and dog) or 2) at higher dose levels, 
enteropathy defined by [CONTACT_52367] (rat only).  All primary toxicity findings were 
completely or partially reversible in the 28-day recovery time frame tested—decreased 
reticulocyte, platelet, RBC, and WBC counts were sensitive and early markers of target 
organ toxicity.

Clinical Experience
The following includes potentially proprietary information from the July 2017 talazoparib 
Investigator’s Brochure:
Approximately 17 studies of talazoparib (single-agent and combination) are ongoing, and 
as of [ADDRESS_55519] received 
talazoparib at doses up to 2 mg/day in company-sponsored clinical studies in hematologic 
malignancies and solid tumors. Two ongoing investigator-sponsored studies are evaluating 
the combination of talazoparib with DNA-damaging chemotherapy (temozolomide, 
irinotecan). The majority of available efficacy and safety data was obtained from studies in 
solid tumors. A Phase 1 study in patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors defined 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of talazoparib as 1 mg/day. Data from this study 
demonstrated objective responses and/or clinical benefit in patients with breast, 
ovarian/peritoneal, and pancreatic cancer; SCLC; and Ewing sarcoma. A Phase [ADDRESS_55520] 
cancer with deleterious germline BRCA mutations demonstrated single-agent activity with 
an objective response rate of 27.7%. In the cohort of patients who were previously treated 
with platinum-containing regimens (N = 48 who were tumor-evaluable), 2 patients had 
complete responses (CRs). An ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_55521] 
cancer. In a Phase 1 study of talazoparib in combination with temozolomide or irinotecan, 
confirmed partial responses (PRs) were observed in patients with platinum-resistant 
ovarian cancer, cervical adenocarcinoma, SCLC, and triple-negative breast cancer.
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of all causality reported in ≥20% of patients
administered single-agent talazoparib 1 mg/day are related to myelosuppression (anemia,
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), GI toxicity (nausea, diarrhea, constipation), fatigue,
alopecia, and headache. TEAEs of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥3 severity in ≥5% of patients were related to
myelosuppression. The adverse events (AEs) associated with talazoparib are detectable
through routine laboratory and clinical monitoring and may be managed with supportive 
care or dose reductions or interruptions as described in each study protocol. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of talazoparib as a single agent was evaluated in 142 adult
patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors at doses of 0.025 to 2 mg/day
administered orally, as a single dose or as multiple doses. The PK was similar in patients of
each cancer type and no differences were apparent between males and females. Oral
absorption of talazoparib was rapid and independent of dose after administration of single 
or multiple doses. Elimination appeared to follow biphasic kinetics; at 1 mg/day (the
recommended dose), the mean terminal half-life (t1/2) was approximately [ADDRESS_55522] for unchanged parent talazoparib. Following

13repeated administration at 1 mg/day, talazoparib accumulated approximately 2.4-fold 
relative to a single dose. A food-effect study showed that food had no clinically meaningful 
effect on the extent of absorption; talazoparib is being administered without regard to food 
in ongoing safety and efficacy studies.
At test concentrations in excess of therapeutic exposures (approximately 200-fold Cmax),
talazoparib does not markedly induce or inhibit CYP enzymes. Furthermore, concentrations
in excess of therapeutic exposures (approximately 20-fold Cmax) did not inhibit membrane
transporter function. Therefore, it is unlikely that talazoparib will demonstrate clinically
significant DDIs when co-administered with corresponding CYP or transporter substrates.
However, talazoparib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP), and plasma talazoparib concentrations may increase or decrease when
Co-administered with P-gp or BCRP inhibitors or inducers, respectively.
Additional ongoing Phase 1 company-sponsored clinical studies are evaluating the 
excretion and plasma PK of carbon 14 (14C)-labeled talazoparib; the PK of talazoparib in 
patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment, DDIs, and the effects of talazoparib 
on cardiac repolarization. Clinical development of talazoparib is ongoing in solid tumors as
monotherapy and in combination with other agents.
Potential Food and Drug Interactions
Based on in vitro data, talazoparib (BMN 673) is not likely to inhibit metabolism via 
human cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzymes.  Effects of co-administration of repeat 
dosing of BMN [ADDRESS_55523] of food on the pharmacokinetics of 
talazoparib (BMN 673) in healthy male subjects suggest that food delayed absorption of 
talazoparib (BMN 673) as indicated by a prolonged T max and reduced C max in the fed 
compared to fasted state, but did not affect the overall extent of absorption as indicated by 
[CONTACT_52368] 0-last and AUC 0-∞ values in the fed and fasted states.  Based on these 
findings, talazoparib (BMN 673) will be taken without regard to food in this current study. 
2.3 Rationale
Talazoparib (BMN 673), a highly selective and potent PARP inhibitor, has shown 
anticancer activity in preclinical models and early clinical trials in the setting of defects in 
the DNA repair pathway.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_52336] (BMN 673) on DNA damage and apoptosis markers in tumor biopsy tissue and 
assess for the antitumor effect of treatment with talazoparib (BMN 673) in patients with 
advanced ovarian, breast, or other solid tumors, and deleterious BRCA mutations.   
2.4 Correlative Studies Background
Tumor biopsies will be mandatory and will be evaluated for pharmacodynamic (PD) 
studies for evidence of DNA damage repair and apoptosis (e.g., γH2AX, ERCC1, pNbs1, 
XPF, RAD51, pT1989ATR, activated cleaved caspase 3, and as indicators of ATR/ATM 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
14activation, chk1 and chk2).  Circulating tumor cells (CTCs will be collected pre-dose and 
following study drug administration, on day 1 of every subsequent cycle (every 3 cycles for 
patients on study for more than 12 months), at the time of the optional restaging follow-up 
biopsy (if applicable), and at time of disease progression to measure any changes in the 
number of circulating CTCs and the level of γH2AX, and to evaluate whether we can 
measure changes in the phenotype over time to explore any correlation with response to 
treatment or disease progression.  Analysis will be performed in [CONTACT_52390]’ lab at the 
Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research.
Histone H2AX is one of the H2A histones present in nucleosomes in normal and cancer 
tissues and is one of the earliest markers of DNA double-strand breaks [ 28-30].  γH2AX is 
phosphorylated at its C-terminus (serine 139 in humans) within minutes following DNA 
double-strand breaks marking the chromatin domain around the broken chromosomal DNA 
ends, thus allowing the recruitment of repair factors [ 28, 30-33].  The levels of γH2AX are 
directly correlated to the amounts of double-strand breaks, and can be used as a dosimeter 
and biomarker for DNA double-strand breaks.  
Because the product of the PARP enzyme is PAR molecules, a validated immunoassay will 
be used to determine the amount of cellular PAR in tumor biopsies as a clinical biomarker 
of PARP inhibition [ 34, 35].
Additionally, to further understand the potential for carcinomas to adapt to treatment by 
[CONTACT_52369][INVESTIGATOR_018]-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the implications of initial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]-mesenchymal phenotype on the response of patients to talazoparib [ 36, 37], 
tumor biopsies will be evaluated for markers of epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]/mesenchymal state, such as E-
cadherin, vimentin, and β-catenin.

5 TREATMENT PLAN
This is an open-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_52337]-agent talazoparib (BMN 673), an oral PARP inhibitor, 
in patients with histologically confirmed BRCA-positive ovarian or primary peritoneal 
carcinoma; BRCA-positive breast cancer; other solid tumors (other than breast or ovarian) 
whose disease has progressed following at least one line of standard therapy or who have no 
acceptable standard treatment options. 
Reported adverse events and potential risks for talazoparib (BMN 673) are described in Section 
7.  Appropriate dose modifications for talazoparib (BMN 673) are described in Section 6.
History and physical examination can be done up to [ADDRESS_55535] cycle and then prior to every new cycle (up to 3 days before start of a new cycle).
Labs (CBC with differential; serum chemistries) will be performed at baseline, within 2 days of 
day 8, and during week 3 of cycle 1, and then at the start of each subsequent cycle (up to 3 
days before start of a new cycle).
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-[ADDRESS_55536] would for a given site.
5.1 Agent Administration
Talazoparib (BMN 673) will be administered orally at 1000 µg/day each day, which is the 
recommended Phase II dose.  Each cycle is 28 days (± 1 day for scheduling).  Patients will 
be asked to maintain a Study Medication Diary ( Appendix B) and record each dose of 
study medication.  Patients will be given instructions for completing the medication diary 
and will be asked to return it to the clinic staff at the end of each cycle.  After cycle 2, 
patients may miss up to 10% of the planned doses for any cycle without causing a protocol 
violation.
Patients will be considered evaluable for the primary objective of the trial if their biopsy 
procedures yield matched, evaluable (i.e., ≥5% tumor content) baseline and day 8 tumor 
biopsies.
Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose 
modifications are described in Section 6.  No investigational or commercial agents or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_52338]’s malignancy.
5.[ADDRESS_55537] cycle, and then at the start of 
each cycle.  If any weekly evaluation demonstrates grade ≥ [ADDRESS_55538] available supportive care.  All concurrent 
medications should be documented prior to initiation of treatment, and be periodically 
reviewed with the patient.
Based on in vitro data, talazoparib (BMN 673) is not likely to inhibit metabolism via 
human cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzymes.  Because there is a potential for interaction 
with other concomitantly administered drugs, the case report form will capture the 
concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
5.2.1Nausea/Vomiting
Anti-emetics will not be administered routinely prior to talazoparib (BMN 673).  
However, if a patient develops nausea/vomiting, anti-emetics such as but not 
limited to prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, 5-HT3 antagonists may be given.  In 
addition, if a patient develops nausea and/or vomiting that is Grade 2 or greater, 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
20antiemetics may be instituted prophylactically at the discretion of the investigator.  
Nausea and vomiting will be considered refractory if it does not resolve to≤ Grade [ADDRESS_55539] an identifiable cause other than study drug 
administration, anti-diarrheals such as Lomotil (diphenoxylate HCl 2.5 mg + 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_52339] 0.025 mg/tablet) dosed according to package insert or loperamide [ADDRESS_55540] unformed stool with 2 mg po with every 2 hours as long as 
unformed stools continue (4 mg every 4 hours while asleep).  No more than 16 mg 
of loperamide should be taken during a 24-hour period).  This regimen can be 
repeated for each diarrheal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  Diarrhea will be considered refractory if it 
does not resolve within 24 hours ≤ to Grade 2 with the above regimen (16 mg, or 
less if there is resolution of the symptoms, of loperamide in a 24-hour period).  If 
the patient develops blood or mucus in the stool, dehydration, or hemodynamic 
instability, or fever along with the diarrhea, anti-diarrheals will be discontinued and 
the patient will be treated with IV fluids and antibiotics as medically indicated.
5.2.3Neutropenia
To reduce the risk of severe myelosuppression events, a complete blood count 
(CBC) should be performed weekly during cycle 1, and at the start of each 
subsequent cycle (up to 3 days before start of new cycle).  Febrile neutropenia is a 
life-threatening complication requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52340]-spectrum 
antibiotics, as well as an aggressive search for the source and microbial cause of the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  Growth factors to prevent neutropenia will not be administered 
prophylactically.  If necessary, they may be administered according to accepted 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines to allow re-treatment.
5.2.4Anemia
Symptomatic anemia should be treated with red blood cell transfusion and is 
recommended if the hemoglobin falls below 8 g/dL.  The initiation of erythropoietic 
therapy for the management of chemotherapy-induced anemia follows the 
American Society of Hematology/ASCO clinical practice guidelines 
(http://www.asco.org).
5.2.5Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia will be treated conservatively.  In the absence of bleeding, or a 
necessary invasive procedure, platelet transfusions should be given for a platelet 
count ≤10,000/mm3.  If invasive procedure(s) is (are) planned, or the patient 
develops bleeding, platelet transfusions should be administered in accordance with 
the standard of practice, usually maintaining a platelet count above 50,000/mm3.
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
215.3 Duration of Therapy
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one 
of the following criteria applies:
• Disease progression
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment
• Significant toxicity occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 2 dose reductions as described in Section 6 
• Pregnancy
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.
5.[ADDRESS_55541] dose is administered or until one of the 
following occurs: patient enrolls on another protocol, patient receives standard of care, or 
death, whichever comes first.  The follow-up will consist of a phone call between Days 27-
[ADDRESS_55542]-
treatment will be followed until stabilization or resolution via phone calls as clinically 
indicated.
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study
Patients will be removed from study for one of the following reasons: completed 30-day 
follow up period or toxicities are unresolved but stabilized, patient enrolls on another 
protocol, or patient receives standard of care.  The reason for study removal and the date 
the patient was removed must be documented in the medical record and communicated by 
[CONTACT_52370] 4.
6 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
Toxicities should have resolved to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_55543] the end of the previous cycle of 28 days for 
scheduling conflicts at the discretion of the investigator. 
Patients will be allowed up to 2 dose reductions per the table below.  If more than 2 dose 
reductions are required, the patient will be removed from the study.

6.1 Dose Modifications
Dose modifications are defined below:
6.1.1Patients with creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min will be dose reduced to DL-1 
(750 µg/day), per the approved talazoparib package insert, and may be re-escalated 
to DL1 with a creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min.
6.1.2Grade 2 Drug-related toxicity: No changes will be made to the dose of talazoparib 
(BMN 673) for Grade 2 toxicities.  Therapy will not be interrupted for Grade 2 
hematologic toxicities.
6.1.3Grade 3-4 Drug-related non-hematologic toxicities: Doses of talazoparib (BMN 
673) will be held until toxicities recover to ≤ Grade 2 or baseline prior to re-
initiating treatment at the next lower dose level.  Electrolyte abnormalities will not 
require dose reduction if resolution to Grade 2 or less is documented within 72 
hours.  Dose modifications for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea will be made only if 
they are refractory to treatment ( See Section 5.2).
6.1.4Grade 3 Drug-related hematologic toxicities: Dose of talazoparib (BMN 673) will 
be held until hematologic toxicities, except anemia, lymphopenia, or leucopenia in 
the absence of Grade [ADDRESS_55544] resolved to ≤ Grade 2 prior to 
re-initiating treatment at the same dose level.
6.1.5Grade 4 Drug-related Hematologic Toxicities: Dose of talazoparib (BMN 673) will 
be held until hematologic toxicities, except anemia, lymphopenia, or leucopenia in 
the absence of Grade [ADDRESS_55545] resolved to ≤ Grade 2 prior to re-initiating 
treatment at the next lower dose level.

that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within [ADDRESS_55549] Administration of the 
Investigational Agent/Intervention 1, 2
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)
NOTE:  Investigators MUST immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or 
not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
1) Death
2) A life-threatening adverse event 
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 
24 hours 
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions 
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).
ALL SERIOUS adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via CTEP-
AERS within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
277.3.3Protocol-specific expedited AE reporting exclusions
For this protocol only, certain AEs/grades are exceptions to the Expedited 
Reporting Guidelines and do not require expedited reporting (i.e., CTEP-AERS).  
These are any grade lymphopenia, any grade alopecia, Grade 2 electrolyte (sodium, 
potassium, phosphorous, magnesium) abnormalities, Grade 2 anemia, Grade 2 
hypoalbuminemia, Grade 2 hyperglycemia, Grade 2 INR, Grade 2 PTT, Grade 2 
hyperglycemia, and Grade 2 hyperuricemia will NOT be reported through CTEP-
AERS but will be reported in the routine data submissions.
7.3.4Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal
NOTE: When submitting CTEP-AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed for 
patients who became pregnant on study, and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to [PHONE_100].  The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to 
the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the 
“Description of Event” section of the CTEP-AERS report.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy
Because patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure 
of the fetus to agents which may be teratogenic, DCTD/DCP is requesting 
that pregnancy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP-AERS 
as Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions – Other 
(pregnancy)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
SOC.
The pregnancy outcome for patients on study should be reported via CTEP-
AERS at the time the outcome becomes known, accompanied by [CONTACT_52371].
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy loss
Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.” Any pregnancy 
loss should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy loss” under 
the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC.
A pregnancy loss should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 event under the 
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC, as currently CTEP-
AERS recognizes this event as a patient death.
[IP_ADDRESS] Death Neonatal
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_52372] 28 days of life” that is felt by [CONTACT_52373]/intervention, should be reported expeditiously.
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
28A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “Death 
neonatal” under the General disorders and administration SOC.
Neonatal death should NOT be reported as Grade 5 “Death neonatal” under 
the General disorders and administration SOC.  If reported as such, the 
CTEP-AERS interprets this as a death of the patient being treated.
7.3.5NCI-IRB Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events, Unanticipated Problems, and 
Deaths
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
Adverse event
An adverse event is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that 
occurs during the course of the clinical trial associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not the event is considered related to the treatment or clinically 
significant.  For this study, AEs will include events reported by [CONTACT_102], as well 
as clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory 
evaluation.  A new illness, symptom, sign or clinically significant laboratory 
abnormality or worsening of a pre-existing condition or abnormality is considered 
an AE.  All AEs must be recorded on the AE case report form unless otherwise 
noted in Section 7.3.3.
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory 
evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution.  
AEs should be reported up to [ADDRESS_55552] dose of study drug.  AEs 
that are considered treatment related, expected, continuing, but not resolvable by 30 
days after treatment completion (e.g., alopecia) will not be followed after the 30-
day period.
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory 
abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:
Results in discontinuation from the study
Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms
Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention
Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
Is judged by [CONTACT_52374]
If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the 
investigator will provide details about the action taken with respect to the 
test drug and about the patient’s outcome.
Suspected adverse reaction
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
29relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.
Unexpected adverse reaction
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity 
that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is 
not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
or elsewhere in the current application.  “Unexpected” also refers to adverse events 
or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.
Serious 
An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition 
of a Serious Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare, or rights of 
subjects or others.
Serious Adverse Advent
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view 
of the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
Death,
A life-threatening adverse drug experience
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions
A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
Disability
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
Life-threatening adverse drug experience
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that places the patient or subject, 
in the view of the investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.
Protocol Deviation (NIH Definition)
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB-approved research protocol.
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
30Non-compliance (NIH Definition)
The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Program 
(HRPP) policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of 
human research subjects.
Unanticipated Problem
Any incident, experience, or outcome that:
Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; Investigator’s 
Brochure or other study documents, and
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND
Is related or possibly related to participation in the research; AND
Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.
[IP_ADDRESS] NCI IRB and Clinical Director Reporting Requirements
The Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_52341]-IRB and 
NCI Clinical Director:
All deaths, except deaths due to progressive disease
All protocol deviations
All unanticipated problems
All non-compliance
Reports must be received within 7 days of PI [INVESTIGATOR_10039].

NOTE: Grade 1 events are not required to be reported.
7.5 Secondary Malignancy
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS.  Three options are available to 
describe the event: 
Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML]) 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
7.6 Second Malignancy
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
[ADDRESS_55554] of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational administered 
in this study can be found in Section 7.

328.1 Talazoparib (BMN 673; NSC 771561)
Other Names: BMN 673ts
Chemical Name:3H-Pyrido[4,3,2-de]phthalazin-3-one, 5-fluoro-8-(4-
fluorophenyl)-2,7,8,9-tetrahydro-9-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-
yl)-, (8S,9R)-, 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (1:1)
Classification:
(CAS):PARP Inhibitor
(1207456-01-6)
Mode of Action:Talazoparib (BMN 673) is a potent and specific inhibitor of 
PARP1 and PARP2, preventing PARP-mediated DNA repair of 
single strand DNA breaks via the base-excision repair pathway.  
It has demonstrated synthetic lethality in tumors with defects in 
DNA repair pathways such as BRCA mutations and PTEN 
dysfunction.
Mol. Formula (BMN 673ts): C26H22F2N6O4S
Mol. Weight (BMN 673ts): 552.5624
Description:Talazoparib (BMN 673) free base is the active moiety of the 
BMN 673ts (tosylate salt) formulation.
Solubility: Unknown
How Supplied: Talazoparib (BMN 673) capsules are supplied by [CONTACT_4618], Inc., and 
distributed by [CONTACT_25523], 
CTEP/DCTD/NCI.  BMN 673 is supplied as 250 mcg capsules 
(opaque white, size 4) packaged in 30-count HDPE bottles with 
an induction seal and child-resistant cap.  The hypromellose 
capsules contain a blend of BMN 673 drug substance, silicified 
microcrystalline cellulose, titanium dioxide, red iron oxide, and 
yellow iron oxide.  
Talazoparib (BMN 673) capsules may be repackaged from the 
manufacturer-supplied HDPE bottle into a pharmacy-supplied 
HDPE bottle for dispensing purposes.
Storage: Drug product is stored at room temperature (15-30°C/59-86° F) 
and protected from light.  If a storage temperature excursion is 
identified, promptly return BMN 673 to between 15-30°C and 
quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion 
(including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration 
of the excursion) to [EMAIL_087] for

CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
33ongoing.
Route of Administration: Oral: talazoparib (BMN 673) can be taken without regard to food.  
Potential Drug Interaction:Based on in vitro data, talazoparib (BMN 673) is not likely to 
demonstrate clinically significant CYP450 inhibition- or 
induction-based drug-drug interactions.  Talazoparib (BMN 673) 
is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) drug transporters.  The PK parameters 
of talazoparib (BMN 673) could be altered if talazoparib (BMN 
673) is coadministered with P-gp and BCRP inhibitors/inducers.  
Studies have shown that talazoparib (BMN 673) is not a substrate 
or an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, 
OAT3, MATE1, or BSEP transporters.
Availability Talazoparib (BMN 673) is an investigational agent supplied to 
investigators by [CONTACT_52375], NCI.  Talazoparib (BMN 673) is 
provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement between 
the Pharmaceutical Collaborator and DCTD, NCI.
8.2 Agent Ordering
NCI-supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be 
treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior 
approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP-assigned protocol number must be used for 
ordering all CTEP-supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, 
Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If 
there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP-supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_25559].

9 CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES
We plan to evaluate the in vivo molecular effects of talazoparib (BMN 673) using pre- and 
post-treatment tumor biopsy specimens and CTCs.  Blood samples for CTCs will be collected 
during cycle [ADDRESS_55556]-drug administration on day 1 (before day 2 dose), 3-[ADDRESS_55557] dose (± 3 days for scheduling 
conflicts), on day 1 of every subsequent cycle (every 3 cycles for patients on study for more 
than 12 months), at the time of the optional restaging follow-up biopsy (if applicable), and at 
time of disease progression.  Mandatory tumor biopsies will be collected for evaluation of 
levels of DNA-damage repair and apoptosis at baseline and 3-[ADDRESS_55558]-dose on day 8 
during cycle 1.  One optional tumor biopsy may also be collected either on day 1 ( 2 days) of 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
35the cycle following any restaging at which a 10-19% increase in tumor volume is observed 
(according to RECIST criteria) if the patient has been on study for at least [ADDRESS_55559] on DNA damage response will be performed using immunoassays to 
measure PAR levels and immunofluorescence assays to measure DNA damage-repair markers 
such as γH2AX, ERCC1, pNbs1, XPF, RAD51, pT1989ATR, activated cleaved caspase 3, and, 
as indicators of ATR/ATM activation, chk1 and chk2.  Evaluation of drug effect on tumor 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]-mesenchymal phenotype will be performed using immunoassays to measure 
phenotypic markers of epi[INVESTIGATOR_52344] (such as E-cadherin, vimentin, and β-
catenin).

9.1.2Blood Collection for CTC Studies
Whole blood will be collected aseptically by [CONTACT_52376] a venous port 
into two 4 mL K3-EDTA tubes.  The collected blood samples are stable for up to 72 
hours at room temperature (15°C to 30°C) prior to processing.  Blood samples for 
CTCs will be collected from all patients at the following (approximate) time points:
Cycle 1 prior to treatment,
Cycle 1, day 1: 3-6 hours after dose
Cycle 1, day 1: approximately [ADDRESS_55561] dose (before second dose)
Cycle 1, day 8: 3-6 hours after dose
Cycle 2, day 1: 3-6 hours after dose (± 3 days for scheduling conflicts)
Every subsequent cycle on day 1 prior to treatment (day 1 of every 3 cycles for 
patients on study more than 12 months)
At the time of the optional restaging follow-up biopsy, if applicable
At time of disease progression
9.1.3Tumor Biopsies
[IP_ADDRESS] Timing of tumor biopsies
Biopsies will be mandatory.  Biopsies will be collected at the following time 
points:
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
36• before drug administration on study (baseline)
• on cycle 1 day 8, 3-6 hours after treatment with talazoparib (BMN 673)
•Optional: one additional biopsy either on day 1 ( 2 days) of the cycle 
following any restaging at which a 10-19% increase in tumor volume is 
observed (according to RECIST criteria) if the patient has been on study 
for at least 4 cycles, or at disease progression  
[IP_ADDRESS] Biopsy Procedure
Serial tumor biopsies will be obtained by [CONTACT_52377] a 
percutaneous approach.  It is preferred that up to 5 core biopsies 18-gauge in 
diameter and ≥1 cm in length will be obtained during each procedure if considered 
safe and feasible.  It is estimated that there will be between 2 million–[ADDRESS_55562] scan be needed for biopsy, the number of scans for each procedure 
will be limited to the minimum number needed to safely obtain a biopsy.  Tumor 
biopsies and local anesthesia will be administered only if they are considered to be 
of low risk to the participant, as determined by [CONTACT_52378].
If the participant chooses not to undergo tumor biopsy, he/she will still remain in 
the study and receive study medication, and all the other correlative studies will be 
performed.
Tumor biopsies are mandatory.  Baseline biopsies will be performed following 
patient enrolling on study.  If an initial attempt at percutaneous biopsy is 
unsuccessful, the patient will be given an option to proceed with a repeated attempt 
at percutaneous biopsy.  A separate consent form must be signed for each biopsy 
procedure, so patients may choose not to undergo subsequent biopsies.  If the 
baseline biopsy is unsuccessful or the patient refuses to undergo subsequent 
biopsies, no further biopsies will be performed but the patient will remain on study, 
receive study medication, and other correlative studies will be performed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Solid Tumor Biopsy Processing
Up to five tissue cores will be collected.  The cores will be transferred into a 1.5-
mL pre-chilled cryovial and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen per DCTD 
SOP340507 (http://dctd.cancer.gov/ResearchResources/biomarkers/ 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
37docs/par/SOP340507_Biopsy_Frozen.pdf).  Samples will be submitted to 
[CONTACT_52391]’ laboratory for evaluation of DNA damage markers, and H&E 
pathology evaluation.  The frozen biopsy specimens are transferred to PADIS on 
dry ice, where the core biopsy samples are stored at -80°C and subsequently 
processed within 7-10 days for analysis.  Biopsy samples will be analyzed for PAR 
levels and DNA damage response and apoptosis as described above; any additional 
cores will be flash-frozen and kept for future analysis.

38Plasma samples should be shipped as described in Appendix D.
9.2 Sample Collection and Processing
Biospecimens will be collected and processed using validated SOPs that will ensure 
both specimen quality and patient confidentiality pursuant to informed consent 
provisions.  Information about each specimen (e.g., blood, tumor biopsy, circulating 
tumor cells, per specific protocol) will be recorded on a PK/PD collection 
worksheet included in Appendix C.
Using a computerized inventory system and a backup hardcopy process, all 
specimen collection and processing steps will be documented and the specific 
location of each specimen will be tracked.  Each new specimen collected will be 
assigned a unique barcode identifier that can be linked to the original specimen 
collected and other relevant information within the inventory system.  To ensure 
patient confidentiality, only containers used for the initial specimen collections will 
be labeled with patient identifiers.  
Only the barcode identifier will be applied to all subsequent specimen containers.  
When specimens are processed and aliquoted, no patient information will be 
included on the new containers.  Original specimen containers will be discarded.  
Only barcode-labeled specimens without patient identifiers will be shipped for 
analysis and/or storage.  Specimen labels will indicate: CTEP protocol number, 
unique patient accession number, 3-digit sample number (see list below), collection 
time, and total volume collected, as appropriate.  Samples from sets of at least three 
patients will be grouped for scientific analysis.
Standardized 3-digit sample collection numbers:
200 series: blood for PK
400 series: blood for circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
500 series: tumor biopsies
The inventory process contains other security provisions sufficient to safeguard 
patient privacy and confidentiality.  Access to the inventory system and associated 
documents will be restricted to appropriate individuals.  Requests to use specimens 
stored in the repository must be approved.  The only patient information available 
in the inventory system will be the patient sex, diagnosis, and level of informed 
consent given.  SOPs ensure that any changes in informed consent made by a 
patient and relayed to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_52347].  All laboratory personnel will be trained to 
adhere to SOPs and will be monitored for high-quality performance.
Any new use of these samples will require prospective IRB review and approval.  
Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an 
additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material.
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-[ADDRESS_55568], the samples will be destroyed (or returned to the 
patient, if so requested), and reported as such to the IRB.  Any samples lost (in 
transit or by a researcher) or destroyed due to unknown sample integrity (i.e., 
broken freezer allows for extensive sample thawing, etc.) will be reported as such to 
the IRB.

[ADDRESS_55572] – Solid Tumors
Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, patients with measurable 
disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_48928].  For the purposes of this study, patients should 
be re-evaluated for response every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles).  In addition to a baseline scan, 
confirmatory scans should also be obtained at least 4 weeks following initial 
documentation of objective response.
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.
11.1.1Definitions
Evaluable for toxicity.  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the 
time of their first treatment with talazoparib (BMN 673).
Evaluable for objective response.  Only those patients who have 
measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
42objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be 
considered evaluable.)
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of 
measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target 
disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or 
unequivocal progression of the lesions.
11.1.2Disease Parameters
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_55573] x-ray or as ≥[ADDRESS_55574] be recorded in 
millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_55575] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 
mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 
≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-
measurable.
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither 
measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple 
cysts.
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability 
described above.  However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same 
patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-[ADDRESS_55576] diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis 
for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified 
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.
11.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
Clinical lesions  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Chest x-ray  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_55577] slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences 
used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as 
with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-[ADDRESS_55578] (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as 
a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety 
for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot 
be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure 
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
Tumor markers  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI 
96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 26:1148-1159, 2008].  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_55579]-line trials in 
ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534-1535, 2000].
Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may 
be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-[ADDRESS_55580] scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up 
corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.
11.3 Response Criteria
11.3.1Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-
target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum 
on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressions).
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
46Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
11.3.2Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.    
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
Principal Investigator).
11.3.3Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

11.4 Duration of Response
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
48Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints
Patients will receive talazoparib (BMN 673) orally at 1000 µg/day, each day, in 28-day 
cycles.  Tumor biopsies will be mandatory predose and 3-[ADDRESS_55584] talazoparib (BMN 
673) dose on cycle [ADDRESS_55585] 16 patients with matched, evaluable 
baseline and day 8 biopsies (with 97% likelihood). The primary endpoint will be the 
percent of patients who achieve a sustained PD response, defined to be at least 4% nuclear 
area positive (NAP) γH2AX at the day 8 biopsy.  In clinical testing, this level of γH2AX is 
seen less than 5% of the time at baseline (in the absence of an active agent) [ 38].  If we 
observe at least 3 out of the 16 (19%) patients with evaluable baseline and day 8 biopsies 
achieving such a sustained PD response, we will declare the agent promising by [CONTACT_52383].  This design will give us 90% power to detect a true 30% sustained PD 
response rate, across patients with less than .[ADDRESS_55586] and the true likelihood of such a sustained PD response, for an 
individual patient, is less than 5%.  [Note: As of 3/24/2020, this study has closed to accrual.  
The PD response rate will be determined and tested against the null hypothesis of 5% (the 
rate of false positivity for the threshold value of 4% NAP γH2AX).]
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate
A total of [ADDRESS_55587] 4% NAP at the pre-treatment biopsy will not be included in the 
primary analysis and for sample size calculations would not be considered evaluable.  In 
order to allow for some patients who will not be evaluable, the accrual ceiling for the study 
is [ADDRESS_55588] been enrolled with 6 having evaluable 
CTEP # 9510
Clinical Center #14-C-0015
51matched biopsy pairs.  Additional patients will be enrolled, up to an accrual ceiling of 15 
(or 24 total patients), yielding a 99% likelihood of accruing 12 patients with evaluable 
biopsy pairs.
It is anticipated that 2-3 patients may be enrolled per month onto this study.  It is expected 
that an additional 8-12 months (as of July, 2017) will be required to accrue the number of 
patients necessary to complete the trial.
13.3 Analysis of Exploratory Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
Mean and SD of change in % NAP, from pre-treatment baseline to day [ADDRESS_55589] Selection
This study will be open to all individuals regardless of gender, ethnicity, or race, provided 
that the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.  Patients for this study will 
be recruited through internal referral, our physician referral base, and through various 
cancer information hotlines (i.e., Clinical Studies Support Center, 1-800-4Cancer).  To 
date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or effect on 
tumor would be expected in one ethnic group compared to another.  Efforts will be made to 
extend accrual to each representative population, but a balance must be struck between 
participant safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to 
potentially ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore racial/ethnic 
aspects of clinical research on the other hand.  If differences in outcome that correlate to 
ethnic identity are noted, a follow-up study may be written to investigate those differences 
more fully.
Due to lack of knowledge of the effects of talazoparib (BMN 673) on the fetus or infants, 
as well as the possibility of teratogenic effects, pregnant and nursing women will be 
excluded from this trial.  Patients with unstable or serious medical conditions are excluded 
due to the possibility that talazoparib (BMN 673) may worsen their condition and the 
likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events to 
talazoparib (BMN 673).  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are 
excluded from the study because of possible PK interactions with talazoparib (BMN 673).
14.1.1Participation of Children
This study includes patients 18 years of age and older.  Because insufficient dosing 
or adverse event data are currently available on the use of talazoparib (BMN 673) in 
patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible 
for future pediatric trials.  Studies will be performed in patients <18 years of age 
when it is appropriate to do so.

5214.2 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts
There may or may not be any clinical benefit to a patient from participation in this trial.  
Their participation will benefit future cancer patients.  Potential risks include the possible 
occurrence of any of a range of side effects that are listed in the consent document.  The 
procedure for protecting against or minimizing risks will be to medically evaluate patients 
as described in Sections 5 and 6.  Although no compensation is available, any injury will be 
fully evaluated and treated in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_52349].
14.3 Consent and Assent Process and Documentation
An associate or principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_52350], 
alternatives, drug administration plan, research objectives, and follow-up of this trial.  The 
patient will be provided an IRB-approved consent for review and signature [INVESTIGATOR_43865]/her 
questions will be answered.  After a decision is made to enroll into the study, a signature 
[CONTACT_52388].  The original signed consent goes to Medical Records; a 
copy will be placed in the research record. Patients will not be consented by [CONTACT_756].
All patients must have a signed informed consent form and an on-study (confirmation of 
eligibility) form filled out and signed by a participating investigator before entering on 
study.
14.3.1Participation of subjects unable to give consent
Adults unable to give consent are excluded from enrolling in the protocol.  However, re-
consent may be necessary and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could 
become decisionally impaired. For this reason and because there is a prospect of direct 
benefit from research participation, all subjects ≥ age 18 at the NCI only will be offered the 
opportunity to fill in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision 
maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research 
Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their medical care in 
the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the 
study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_52351].  For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have pre-determined 
substitute decision maker, the procedures described in MEC Policy 87-4 for appointing a 
surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who 
do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.

64APPENDIX D: PK SAMPLE HANDLING AND SHIPPI[INVESTIGATOR_52355]: As of Amendment H (2/5/2018) blood for PK analysis will no longer be collected.
Pharmacokinetic Blood Sampling and Plasma Sample Preparation
Affix completed sample labels lengthways to vacutainer and cryovials.  Each blood sample 
must be processed within 1 hour of draw.
Collect approximately 5 mL of blood in K3 EDTA vacutainer tubes at room temperature.
Invert vacutainer gently 8-10 times. 
Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Transfer 0.8 mL of plasma into each of three 2-mL cryovials.  To avoid contamination, 
always use a new transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_52356], and do not remove the plasma near the 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047].
Transfer plasma samples to -70oC freezer (within 2 hours of collection). 
Ship 2 cryovials of plasma (primary samples) on dry ice (shippi[INVESTIGATOR_52357]).  Ship 
backup samples on dry ice in a separate shipment. 
PK Sample Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_52358]
Ship PK plasma samples every 3 months or when requested.  
Use an electronic manifest for each shipment (see below).  Each manifest should indicate the 
subject ID, time points, and number of samples included in the shipment.
Place samples grouped by [CONTACT_52384].  Ensure the cryobox is closed and remains so 
in transit using shippi[INVESTIGATOR_45295].  Place the cryobox in a sealable Biohazard bag with an 
appropriate amount of absorbent.
Each shipment should be prepared in accordance with IATA regulations.  Samples must be 
shipped at least 3 days prior to US National Holiday.  
Frozen samples should be shipped via Fed Ex, Monday through Wednesday.  No shipments 
should be made later than Wednesday of any given week.  (Samples should arrive by 
[CONTACT_52385], not on the weekend, because it is closed on weekends.)
For questions regarding sample shipment, contact [CONTACT_52386], [PHONE_937],  
[EMAIL_982]. 
On the day of shipment, e-mail the completed electronic manifest, the tracking number and 
other appropriate paperwork to Lara Graham ([EMAIL_982])

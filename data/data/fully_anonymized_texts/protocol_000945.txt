 2 Overview of study:   Widespread testing and contact [CONTACT_628159]-[ADDRESS_837062] a 1:[ADDRESS_837063] clinic-based tests.   We will recruit individuals seeking COVID-19 testing or presenting to PHMC clinic sites for other types of appointments and randomize them to receive either multiple (1) home test kits or (2) clinic test referrals to encourage people in their social networks to get tested. Individuals who distribute test kits or test referrals will be designated “Index Participants,” or Category [ADDRESS_837064] referrals from Index Participants are called “Network Contacts.” Network Contacts are divided into two categories based on what test distribution method they received: Category [ADDRESS_837065] is to see which strategy (home test kits or clinic test referrals) got more Network Contacts to obtain testing within 8 weeks of the Index Participant getting tested.   Anyone in the study who tests positive for COVID-19 as part of the study (both Index Participants and Network Contacts) will be eligible for the CloseST study: a cohort study of individuals with COVID-[ADDRESS_837066] kits (planned for the start of December, 2021), we will no longer be able to monitor test results from self-testers. Self-testers who test positive must contact [CONTACT_628160].   Figure 1: Overall study plan:

 5 OVERVIEW OF STUDY Trial Design The C-STRAND study is a 1:[ADDRESS_837072] referral cards to others in their social networks, called Network Contacts. Network Contacts can include household members, friends, family, colleagues, or others in Index Participants’ social networks. We will evaluate COVID-[ADDRESS_837073] positive will be assigned to the intervention arm (receiving multiple self-collection test kits) or control arm (test referrals) according to their original assigned arm in the C-STRAND trial.    Intervention Secondary distribution of COVID-[ADDRESS_837074] tube, a prepaid return shippi[INVESTIGATOR_321862], and instruction sheet in English and Spanish.    December 2021 Update: As of December 2021, the intervention will use Ellume rapid antigen tests (Ellume COVID-[ADDRESS_837075], Ellume Health, Brisbane, Australia) authorized under EUA. The antigen kits will use a Bluetooth-enabled test developer device, with test results only available through a smartphone app connected to the device. Test kit packages will include a study QR code linking the test kit to the index participant. If the network contact [CONTACT_628161], test results were then reported to a secure web-based study portal.   Registration of test kits Test kits must be registered online on the study website, and participants must consent to participate in the study to activate the test kits. Participants must provide a name, date of birth, and phone number to register test kits. If participants do not have access to the Internet, they may call study hotline and study personnel will obtain informed consent and register the individual online.  Control Secondary distribution of COVID-[ADDRESS_837076] baseline surveys completed online or through phone. Index participants and network contacts from the treatment arm (exposed group) will be offered [ADDRESS_837077] kits to distribute to close contacts. Index participants and network contacts from the control arm (unexposed group) will be offered [ADDRESS_837078] uptake In order to link Network Contacts who obtain COVID-19 tests to Index Participants, each Index Participant will be assigned a Referral Identification (ID) number. This number will appear on all test referral cards and text messages in the control group, and on test kits in the intervention group. When network contacts request testing, they will be asked to provide the Referral ID number linking them to the Index Participant. We will measure test uptake among self-testers through testing completed at the partner self-testing lab. Among facility-based testers, test uptake will be measured through testing at one of the clinic sites. Study personnel will communicate all test results back to study participants via telephone, with an electronic copy of test results available upon request.  Outcomes The primary outcome in the C-STRAND trial is the proportion of Index study participants linked to at least two Network Contacts who completed testing. Secondary outcomes at the end of the follow-up (week 8) and end of the study by [CONTACT_628162]: number of contacts tested, number of network contacts who test positive, test positivity rate and proportion of first-time test takers. All of these outcomes will be assessed with collected testing results and not rely on self-reported measures. Baseline and follow-up surveys will provide self-reported outcomes related to socio-demographic characteristics as well as COVID-[ADDRESS_837079] positive in each group. Secondary outcomes at the end of the follow-up (week 8) by [CONTACT_625204], include number of contacts tested and number of new cases identified. Similarly, baseline surveys of network contacts in the cohort study will provide similar self-reported outcomes as in aim 1.    
 [ADDRESS_837080] referrals to their contacts.  We will recruit Index Participants both A) Over the phone, by [CONTACT_628163], and B), In-person, for individuals over 18  either receiving COVID testing at participating clinic sites (“testers”) or coming in for other medical appointments (“non-testers”). See Figure [ADDRESS_837081] been printed out and placed in the clinics where patients can see them.

 9 Index participants recruited over the phone  Steps 1-2: Recruitment, Eligibility assessment, and Enrollment of Index Participants:  As outlined in Figure 2 above, we will recruit over the phone and in-person.    In-person recruitment: Study staff will offer recruitment in-person to testers. At that point, COVID-[ADDRESS_837082] study staff.  At Rising Sun, the Interviewer will also actively recruit COVID vaccine patients and patients who are new to the clinic.  Eligibility Assessment  Who: CSTRAND research Interviewers For participants recruited over the phone, interviewers are responsible for calling individuals scheduled to be tested for COVID-19 at their specific site (Health Connection, Rising Sun, or Care Clinic).  For participants recruited in person, Interviewers are responsible for approaching individuals being tested for COVID-[ADDRESS_837083] Interviewers about the study. What: Interviewers will call or talk with individuals who expressed interest assess eligibility.  When: During Step 1 Initial Recruitment  For Phone only:  1. Research Interviewers are responsible for monitoring their respective clinics’ COVID-19 testing schedules to identify prospective participants. 2. If a prospective participant has been added to the schedule, the Interviewer will call them if they are being tested at the Interviewer’s assigned clinic site (e.g., Rising Sun, Care Clinic, or Health Connection).  For both Phone and In-Person Recruitment   3. The Interviewer will describe the study to any individual who indicates interest. If they are interested, interviewers will then assess eligibility through the following questions:  • “Are you 18 or over?” • “Do you have a working telephone number?” • “Have you ever tested positive for COVID-[ADDRESS_837084] 90 days?” • “Have you received a test as part of a COVID study at PHMC?” • “Have you participated in the C-STRAND COVID testing study?”  Note: As of December 2021, we are no longer excluding individuals who have tested positive, as long as they haven’t tested positive within the past 90 days.   4. If the individual answers “No” to Items 1-2, or “Yes” to Items 3-4, the Interviewer should mark “ineligible” and indicate the reason for ineligibility (any of the 4). 5. If the individual answers “Yes” to Item 3, the Interviewer will ask when the person received their most recent positive COVID-[ADDRESS_837085] result and note the date in the REDCap database.  In-person Recruitment only: 6. If the individual meets inclusion criteria, the Interviewer will obtain consent to participate and complete and sign the informed consent form.  Phone Recruitment only:  7. If the participant tentatively agrees to participate in the study over the phone, the Interviewer will obtain verbal consent: See Consent section for Index Participants (study script B: “Index Participant – Initial enrollment (verbal consent, phase 1)”). 8. Once verbal consent is obtained, the Interviewer will then begin the baseline survey. 
 [ADDRESS_837086] the potential participant to come to the study table after completing testing for completion of enrollment.    Baseline survey Who: CSTRAND research Interviewers What: Interviewers will conduct the initial baseline survey to obtain baseline information about individuals. See baseline index participant survey instrument. Baseline survey is split into two segments on REDCap: “Baseline” and “Baseline+.”  When: For participants consented over the phone: Immediately after obtaining verbal consent over the phone, prior to COVID testing. Should be conducted over the phone, although can be done in-person at the study site when the participant obtains testing. If the participant chooses to complete the baseline and baseline + surveys later over the phone, research staff will ask to call the participant’s phone before they leave the clinic so the participant will recognize the research staff’s number in the future.  Participants recruited In-person: In-person testers and non-testers will have the option of only completing the minimum number of baseline survey items needed for enrollment in-person, and can complete the rest of the “Baseline” and “Baseline+” survey items within the next week over the phone. This is to minimize in-person interactions and allow for people to enroll in the study who don’t have time for the full survey while they are at a clinic.  Notes:  Participants recruited over the phone: While we will obtain baseline survey data prior to signed informed consent, if individuals scheduled for a COVID-[ADDRESS_837087] do not obtain testing in step 4 or signed informed consent within 30 days of completing their baseline survey, their baseline survey data will be deleted. We are collecting baseline survey data ahead of signed informed consent to minimize logistic burdens of in-person data collection.    COVID-19 testing, signed informed consent, randomization, intervention, and compensation Who: CSTRAND research Interviewers.  What: Some prospective participants will obtain testing at one of the clinic sites, and the Interviewer will approach them about joining the study. Other prospective participants will call an Interviewer about joining the study while they are at a clinic, and the Interviewer will explain it to them. When: Formal enrollment in the study will occur after individuals have obtained COVID-19 testing (if planning to test) and provided signed informed consent.   Testing and Informed Consent:   Once prospective study participants who are getting tested for COVID-[ADDRESS_837088]. If so, we recommend individuals obtain testing prior to signing informed consent, but the research Interviewers can approach individuals prior to testing to obtain signed informed consent if time permits.  Randomization:  Randomization can only occur after 1) signed informed consent, and 2) COVID-19 testing (only applies to those who registered for COVID-19 testing). If individuals  Once informed consent has been completed, individuals will be formally enrolled in the trial, and randomized and assigned to one of two study arms.   
 [ADDRESS_837089] referral cards:  Upon randomization, all Index Participants who receive test referral cards will be assigned a unique 5-digit Index Referral ID Number. This number will be used to test referrals. The numbering convention will be as follows:  1st digit indicates study arm assignment:  - 2XXXX = test referral arm (control) 2nd digit indicates study site: - 1 = Care Clinic - 2 = Mary Howard - 3 = Congreso Health Center - 4 = Health Connection - 5 = Rising Sun 3rd through 5th digits indicate consecutive numbering of study participants within that study arm and study site.   Examples: [ZIP_CODE] = The first participant recruited in the intervention arm at Mary Howard [ZIP_CODE] = The fifth participant recruited in the control arm at Care Clinic [ZIP_CODE] = The fifteenth participant recruited in the intervention arm at Congreso  The same Index Referral ID number will be affixed to all test referrals of the Index Participant. The Index participant will be given all test referral cards, each labeled with the same reference ID number. Please refer to the instructions for assigning Index Participant Referral IDs. All assigned IDs will be tracked in the Referral ID tracking spreadsheet associated with each clinic.  For index participants who receive self-test kits:   Self-test kit numbers will not be tracked for index participants who receive Ellume test kits (starting December 2021).  For network contacts: If Network Contacts test positive and enroll in the CloseST study, their REDCap ID number will become their “Referral ID number.” Their ID numbers will start with 1 and go up after that.    Study intervention:  Self-test kit arm procedures: If randomized the self-test kit arm, the interviewer will go through script C “Index Participant randomized to self-test kit.”   The interviewer will retrieve a package of [ADDRESS_837090] kits to the index participant:  - The interviewer will affix a sticker to each of the [ADDRESS_837091] kit will include a number. The numbers will start with 1, and go up sequentially (for example, testphilly.com/1, testphilly.com/2, testphilly.com/3, etc.). All [ADDRESS_837092]-randomization assessment The Interviewer will also ask the Index Participant the “Intentions” instrument.   Self-testing kits: The Interviewer will provide an explanation to the index participant of how to distribute test kits to contacts and how to use test kits.  In order to use the test kits, a network contact [CONTACT_628164] a smartphone with Bluetooth capability, and they will have to download the Ellume app. and then go to the URL on the test kit or scan the QR code.   Index participants can give the test kit to anyone aged 2 or older.   Intervention instructions:  Participants will be encouraged to distribute the self-tests to individuals in their social network, including family members, with encouragement to deliver to network contacts ages 2 and older who: 1) Has had a known exposure to COVID-19. If exposed, testing should ideally be done 5-7 days after the exposure.    2) Is symptomatic (fever, difficulty breathing, new cough, unusual fatigue, loss of taste or smell, rash on fingers or toes) 3) Is believed to be at high risk of COVID-19 due to multiple in-person interactions with others.  Update November 11, 2022:  In order to comply with changes in the FDA emergency use authorization of rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2, individuals should be advised on appropriate use of test kits.  This update supercedes the prior update in EUA in March 2022.   Participants who receive intervention with test kits: - If individuals obtain an initial negative test result, they should: o Test again 48 to 72 hours (2-3 days) if they have symptoms on the first day of testing o Test [ADDRESS_837093] symptoms (A total of 3 times over 5 days) - If individuals obtain an initial positive test result, no repeat testing is needed to confirm the result.   Note: - If individuals test negative and need another test kit, they can bring the study-issued test kit to a clinic to receive two additional Ellume test kits at no cost.  - Only individuals who have proof of a negative study-issued test can obtain two additional Ellume test kits (to be pi[INVESTIGATOR_628153] a study site). They must show proof of:  o 1) a test kit from the study o 2) a negative result in the past [ADDRESS_837094] referral Arm procedures:  For index participants randomized the self-referral arm, the Interviewer will go through script D “Index Participant randomized to test referrals.”   The index participant will receive [ADDRESS_837095] referral cards with guidance on distributing them. They will also receive a text message with simple instructions to send to contacts on how to get tested, which they can then copy and send to contacts (See Script N.1. “Referral for Index Participant in Test Referral arm.” 
 [ADDRESS_837096] will be labeled with the Index Referral ID number. The Interviewer will then enter the 5-digit index referral number into that patient’s record. Test referral cards will be kept in secure location at clinic sites.  Test referral cards: • Test referral cards will have clinic information on where to get testing and instructions to return the card to the Interviewer in each of the clinic sites. If the Interviewer is unavailable at the time, the subject can also return the card to the front desk staff.   Instructions: Participants will be encouraged to distribute COVID-[ADDRESS_837097] the text message referral to individuals age 18 and over in their social networks, including family members, with encouragement to deliver to network contacts who:  1) Have had a known exposure to COVID-19. If exposed, testing should ideally be done 5-7 days after the exposure.    2) Are symptomatic (fever, difficulty breathing, new cough, unusual fatigue, loss of taste or smell, rash on fingers or toes) 3) Are believed to be at high risk of COVID-19 due to in-person interactions with others.  Study Compensation:  At the end of enrollment of an index participant, Interviewers will:  - Give the index participant a $[ADDRESS_837098] results are positive. - Remind the index participant they will be contact[CONTACT_84658] 8 weeks to complete a follow-up survey, lasting approximately 5 minutes, and that if they complete it, they will get an additional $[ADDRESS_837099].  If the participant has enrolled in the study and has completed the minimum required forms on the baseline survey, the Interviewer will load $15 onto the participant’s ClinCard. The following are the minimum forms required for payment are: - Identity (to be completed in-person) - Randomization (to be completed in-person) - Sociodemographics (to be completed in-person or over the phone) - Symptoms (to be completed in-person or over the phone) - COVID Exposure (to be completed in-person or over the phone)  Baseline Survey+, Baseline Survey Part II (optional), delivery of test results If the participant did not complete all of the baseline survey items at the time of enrollment, the Interviewer will call the participant within one week of randomization to complete the survey with them.  If the index participant consented to participate in the DCRI national study, they will be contact[CONTACT_628165]. This should be done within one week of study enrollment.   Delivery of test results See the section below “Daily Review of Test results.”    Follow-up survey and study compensation:  Follow up of index participants At week 8, index participants will receive a text message, a call, or an email from study staff (See Script N.2 “Text message for Index Participants at 8-week follow-up”) indicating that it is has been 8 weeks since they registered for the study. The index participant will be asked about scheduling a time to complete the follow-up survey with an Interviewer over the phone. See 8-week follow-up survey. 
 14 If the survey is completed, the Interviewer will add an additional $[ADDRESS_837100] it, they can pi[INVESTIGATOR_628154].   A reminder text message, call or email will be sent once a week for four weeks if the index participant has not completed the survey.  Study Compensation:  Once the follow-up survey has been completed, the research Interviewer will inform the index participant that an additional $[ADDRESS_837101] arm (Category 2), or test referral cards and texts in the test referral arm (Category 3).

 [ADDRESS_837106] RESULTS (for tester index participants and test-referral network contacts)  Research interviewers will be responsible for reviewing all self-test results and clinic test results on a daily basis.  Review of self-test results Self-test results:  1. Positive test results will trigger a phone call (see Script I “Communication of test results – COVID-19 positive” for COVID-[ADDRESS_837107] results will trigger a phone call (see Script H “Communication of test results – COVID-19 negative”)   Review of clinic test results: The interviewer will be responsible for reviewing all test results daily.  1. Negative test results: No call needed (clinic staff call participants)  2. Positive test results – Follow the script as indicated below for COVID-[ADDRESS_837108] RESULTS  Summary: All individuals who test positive for COVID-[ADDRESS_837109] for follow-up. Here, we lay out procedures depending on who is testing positive. COVID-19 participants are divided into two groups: ST participants (those in the Self-Testing arm) and TR participants (those in the Test Referral arm) (See Figure 3).    Counseling on COVID-19  COVID-19 participants Protocol (See Script I “Communication of test results – COVID-19 positive”) • If someone else pi[INVESTIGATOR_293915], ask for best way to get ahold of contact [CONTACT_628170]. • Make at least one attempt within [ADDRESS_837110] result receipt. • Each attempt = 2 back-to-back calls with a voicemail left. • If no voicemail is available, try at least [ADDRESS_837111] result receipt to reach them. • Interviewers should make a total of [ADDRESS_837112]. • If the individual is unable to be reached, you may mark “Unable to reach” as the final disposition. • NEVER reveal test results to anyone else without first confirming identity.   Eligibility: 1. At least [ADDRESS_837113] who tests positive about joining the COVID+ cohort, and will keep track of the attempts in REDCap o The Interviewers will make 4 attempts to reach a COVID+ TR network contact [CONTACT_628171]+ cohort o The day that the test result is received o [ADDRESS_837114] an Interviewer about joining the COVID+ cohort by [CONTACT_3379] a phone number printed on the bottom of their self-test kit. o Interviewers will ask if the Network Contact [CONTACT_628172]-[ADDRESS_837115] kits for close contacts.  o If the COVID-19+ person entered the study through the self-testing arm Index Participant or the Network Contact [CONTACT_628173] J “Informed Consent for COVID-19+ network contact [CONTACT_628174]-Test arm” and Script K “Informed Consent for COVID-19+ network contact [CONTACT_628175]”)  If the COVID-19 participant is in the Self-testing arm (COVID-19 ST): (see Script L “Contact [CONTACT_628176]-19+ participants ST arm”) - The interviewer will ask individuals about close contacts and will offer up to [ADDRESS_837116] and receive a $[ADDRESS_837117] the COVID-19 Participant survey over the phone.   Delivery of self-testing kits to close contacts: Self-test kits can be obtained by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up at the PHMC clinic sites where the Index Participant registered. Participants should have a contact [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_628155].   The interviewer will arrange test-kit pi[INVESTIGATOR_628156]+ participants.  The interviewer will enter the following key elements: - Complete COVID-[ADDRESS_837118] referral arm: (see Script M “Contact [CONTACT_628176]-19+ participants TR arm”) - The interviewer will ask individuals about close contacts - The interviewer will elicit close contact [CONTACT_3031], and help the individual prioritize who to give testing to.  - The interviewer will instruct COVID-19 participant to tell close contacts to quarantine, monitor symptoms, and that if desired, they can obtain testing at PHMC clinics - The interviewer will then send the COVID-19 participant a “COVID-19 referral text” (See Script N.3 “Text message for COVID-[ADDRESS_837119] referral”) that they can forward to contacts.   Network contacts in self-test kit arm who test positive:  - Need to be registered in RedCap   Study compensation:  Index Participants: o At the end of the phone call, the interviewer will ask the COVID+ participant if they still have their ClinCard.  o If they have their ClinCard, this will be reloaded with $15.  o If they do not have their ClinCard, they can be sent a $[ADDRESS_837120] (Target gift card or electronic ClinCard, if available).   Network Contacts o Study compensation for network contacts who enroll in COVID+ cohort:  o They will be able to receive $30 as target virtual gift cards as a single one-time payment.   
 19  Sample Size The sample size for the C-STRAND trial was calculated based on the primary outcome of Aim 1. Power calculations were completed using STATA 15.1 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX). With an estimate that 45% in the control group achieve success, defined as at least two network contacts completing testing, we calculated a sample size of [ADDRESS_837121] a 10% difference (two-tailed alpha of 0.05, power of 90%). If in fact we observe a success rate as low as 25% in the control group, with a sample size of 1048, we will have 90% power to detect as small as an 8% difference.   For the CloseST study, we will aim to recruit up 210 study participants in the C-STRAND trial diagnosed with COVID-19. Data from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health shows that the median number of close contacts provided per individual with COVID-19 is approximately three.21 Assuming the mean number of close contacts infected with COVID-19 is approximately one, and 50% obtain testing, we can expect the mean number of positive tests per index COVID-19 positive index participant to therefore be approximately 0.5. We assumed a conservative allocation ratio of 2:[ADDRESS_837122] deviation range, we would need a total N=54 for 80% power with a p=0.05. With a standard deviation as high as 1.0, we would need a total N=[ADDRESS_837123] 90% power to detect a difference between groups. A total of 210 individuals (representing a 20% positivity rate among Index Participants), even with a standard deviation of 1.0, would give us 93% power to detect a doubling of positive cases identified.  Data Analysis All analyses will be performed based on intention-to-treat. In the C-STRAND trial, the primary analysis will use the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusting for study site, to compare the proportion of individuals in each arm who succeeded in getting two contacts tested. Sex will be included with an interaction term in multivariable models using logistic regression. In secondary analyses, Wilcoxon Rank-sum tests and linear regression or negative binomial regression will be used to compare each of the count and continuous outcomes (e.g., total number of contacts tested).  In the CloseST study, we will use Poisson regression to compare the number of contacts who test positive at week 8 among contacts of SARS-COV-2 positive individuals who received the intervention or the control. Additional comparisons will follow the same approach for the secondary outcomes. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) > 0.1 will be used to determine balance between arms and identify potential confounders between participants in either study arm. If there is imbalance in the characteristics between the arms, additional analyses will consider potential confounders, including age, race/ethnicity, education, employment status, socioeconomic status, housing status, household size, relationship status, risk of COVID-19 exposure, and site of recruitment.

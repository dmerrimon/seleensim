Abstract:  
Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains one of the most prevalent and successful surgical 
procedures performed on patients seeking return to function fr om arthritic pain.  Effective pain 
control is critical after surgery to permit earlier mobilization, maximize patient satisfaction, 
and facilitate outpatient surgery. Multimodal analgesia protocols are the back bone for post -
operative functional recovery after TJA , and efforts to optimize these protocols with new FDA 
approved medications remain of significant importance. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a recent  FDA approved medication: bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] +low dose meloxicam 
extended release (ER) solution  (HTX -011) , for post -operative pain control after total knee 
arthroplasty. This is a 1:[ADDRESS_62392] our institution’s standard of care arthroplasty block cocktail. Patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_57300]. The primary 
outcome of interest is pain control over 72 hours after surgery collected through pain diaries recording an 11 -point numeric rating scale (NRS) of [ADDRESS_62393] of care.

RCT  
  Version 2.[ADDRESS_62404] of care.1-3. Optimizing peri operative 
pain control is crucial to achieving these goals.  
Current practice for perioperative pain management during TKA involves the use of 
multimodal analgesia (MMA) . MMA  includes multiple oral and IV medications tasked with 
blocking sensory input around the knee for a period around the indexed surgery4. Together, 
MMA protocols are designed to reduce the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], decrease postoperative pain 
intensity and encourage earlier discharges . These effects drive down costs  of care. Included 
with these medications are periarticular injections, which have proven effective in achieving 
both pain intensity and functional improvement after surgery.[ADDRESS_62405] been tested with conflicting evidence reported in their efficacy compared to “shorter acting” substances beyond [ADDRESS_62406] effectiveness point of view. 
Recently, the FDA approved a new periarticular extended release (ER) solution 
consisting of low dose meloxicam + bupi[INVESTIGATOR_57265]. Their decision is based on the results of a recent Phase 2b clinical trial investigating this drug against standard local periarticular analgesic options.
4 In this Phase 2 clinical trial, 232 patients 
undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia were studied,

400mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]/12mg meloxicam  ER solution  intraarticularly prior to closure provide d 
superior pain reduction out to 72 hours following TKA compared to placebo and  active control

1.2 Clinical Data to Date  
Recently, the FDA approved this  new periarticular pain medication, low dose 
meloxicam + bupi[INVESTIGATOR_57266], bunionectomy 
and open inguinal herniorraphy4,8,9. For total knee arthroplasty (TKA) , this approval  decision 
is based on the results of a recent clinical trial investigating this drug against local periarticular 
analgesic options  (active control) and placebo groups .4 In th at Phase 2 clinical trial, 232 
patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia were 
studied, and the authors’ results ultimately demonstrated that the application of the study drug, 
400mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]/12mg meloxicam  ER solution, intraarticularly prior to closure of a 
standard TKA midline incision provides superior pain reduction through [ADDRESS_62410] to 
critically review the safety of single shot adductor canal blocks , spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227], and local 
skin anesthetic  in patients receiving this study medication. Nathaniel Brinkman, Pharm D., 
RPh, provided a critical analysis of the dosing of this medication, plasma concentrations and

Page 12 of 51 
Salmons, Harold I. M.D.   CONFIDENTIAL  concluded that it is safe to use a single shot adductor canal block plus spi[INVESTIGATOR_57267] + low dose meloxicam ER solution. His decision is based on available clinical information  which is outlined as follows . Inter -patient variability aside, pertinent data 
points include a local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) from bupi[INVESTIGATOR_57268] 2,000ng/mL. Concentration max for HTX -011 400mg in TKA was 695 ng/mL, which 
was reached at 21 hours per the package insert. A poster by [CONTACT_57302] . included a range 
of 368- 1,550 ng/mL (mean 710 ng/mL) in mammoplasty , i.e. not an intra articular use, which 
reached max concentration at 3.58 hours (1.27- 34.58). Median plasma concentration for 
combination spi[INVESTIGATOR_57269] 538 ng/mL (range, 176-1,384 ng/mL)
11. The theoretical max if all serum concentration maximums were reached at the same 
time would be 2,079 ng/mL, however the intra articular instillation and prolonged elution of 
this medication protects against simultaneous serum peak concentrations. This extends to the 
use of 75 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_57270] a local skin anesthetic during closure as is the preference of senior 
author MPA. Local use of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_57271] a peak between 200-300 ng/mL at approximately [ADDRESS_62411] a cumulative peak of 800- 900 ng/mL within the 30-120- minute  
timeframe, well before the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] +low dose meloxicam ER solution instilled intra articularly peaks, and below the 2,000 ng/mL toxicity threshold.

2 Study Objectives  
 

Periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + meloxicam ER solution vs Standard Practice During TKA: An 
RCT  
  Version 2.[ADDRESS_62413] non-industry funded investigation of the use of a recently FDA approved periarticular pain medication for controlling postoperative pain following total knee arthroplasty.   Primary Objective  
 To assess the effectiveness of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] +meloxicam periarticular ER solution in 
controlling postoperative pain out to [ADDRESS_62414] arthroplasty block controls.  2.2 Secondary Objective 
Periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + meloxicam ER solution vs Standard Practice During TKA: An 
RCT  
  Version 2.[ADDRESS_62415]- operative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (standardized into MMEs), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], adverse reactions or 
events, distance walked at time of discharge with PT.  
2.1.1 Study Rationale 
Based on available literature, periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + low dose meloxicam ER solution has been demonstrated as a new  and safe means of providing prolonged patient analgesia 
after total knee arthroplasty. Its novelty is in both its formulation and needle- free instillation. 
As the available studies to date examining this medication are industry-funded, the primary rationale for examining this FDA approved medication at our institution is to provide an unbiased evaluation of this new medication in the setting of quality improvement initiatives to our institution’s patient care. Multimodal analgesia (MMA) is critical to achieving better 
outcomes after total joint arthroplasty, as it has been shown to decrease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57272]. It also has the benefit of reducing narcotic consumption postoperatively. Continuing to evaluate optimal protocols and new medications for MMA consideration remains of significant value.   Various means of controlling post-operative pain are currently employed at Mayo Clinic. Standard arthroplasty block is a cocktail of multiple medications instilled with a needle prior to closure of total knee arthroplasties. In 100cc of our current  formulation, there is 225mg of 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 5mg/mL, 0.6mg epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1mg/mL, 30mg ketorolac 30mg/mL diluted in sodium chloride. While effective at controlling patients’ pain intensity postoperatively, ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]’s post- operative analgesic effects are recognized to last for less than 24 hours. As 
Periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + meloxicam ER solution vs Standard Practice During TKA: An 
RCT  
  Version 2.[ADDRESS_62416], continuing to evaluate MMA protocols using new, FDA approved medications remains 
of significant value.   An essential component to a new drug reaching FDA approval is an analysis of not only the drug’s efficacy but also its safety profile. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + low dose meloxicam ER solution has been shown through multiple large clinical trials to be safe with its most common 
adverse effects reported as constipation, nausea and headache
4,8,9.   
 
2.1.2 Anticipated Risks  
The existing evidence on this new FDA approved medication suggests that it is safe. The 
adverse effects with >/= 10% incidence that have been reported are constipation, vomiting 
and headache. This is a single one- time intra articular dose of this medication. As such, the 
standard risks of intravenous instillation of local analgesics such as bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 
(cardiotoxicity) and meloxicam (renal, GI, bleeding and cardiovascular toxicity) are likely mitigated by [CONTACT_57304] -time dose. Further, following thorough discussion 
with on staff pharmacy expert, Nathaniel Brinkman, Pharm D, the elution kinetics of this medication outlined in the available literature does not show brisk accumulation in serum given the local instillation and prolonged elution kinetics of the medication as detailed above in section 1.2. Thus, the drug is considered  safe with adjuvant neural blockade such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_57273], single shot adductor canal block and local anesthetic instillation to skin during 
Periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + meloxicam ER solution vs Standard Practice During TKA: An 
RCT  
  Version 2.[ADDRESS_62417] of possible risks and adverse effects 
includes:  
- Hypersensitivity/ allergic response 
- Hypertension 
- Renal toxicity  
- Cardiac toxicity  
- Hepatotoxicity/transaminitis  
- Methemoglobinemia 
- Heart failure and edema  
- Prolongation of postoperative bleeding 
- Drug -drug interactions with other NSAIDs, hemostasis interfering medications (e.g. 
warfarin, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], SSRI/SNRIs) 
 There are also risks associated with the index surgery which are explained to every patient during their informed consent for surgery. These risks include: 
• Death  
• Fever  
• Infection  
• Damage to surrounding neurovascular or ligamentous structures during surgery 
• Stroke 
• Wound complications 
• Deep venous thrombosis or Pulmonary embolism

Description  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + low dose meloxicam ER solution is a recent FDA approved medication used for periarticular instillation to reduce postoperative pain. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + low dose meloxicam ER solution has been approved for bunionectomy, open inguinal herniorrhaphy, and total knee arthroplasty. Its efficacy has been described out to 72 hours due to a proprietary polymer design with prolonged elusion pharmacokinetics of its two primary ingredient reagents . The drug has been designed and manufactured by [CONTACT_57309] (Heron 
Therapeutics, San Diego, CA) for use as a multimodal analgesic local analgesic during surgery. This medication was recently  approved for formulary status in TKA at Mayo Clinic. 
Traceability will be maintained through standard institutional practice for formulary drugs administered during a patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n. The specific purpose of the use of this 
medication in this study is to evaluate whether it provides superior analgesia for [ADDRESS_62429] contraindications to receiving this medication during their indexed primary total knee arthroplasty. The goal is to

Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] +meloxicam ER formulation is intended for single dose administration only. The drug is applied without a needle into the surgical site following final irrigation and suction and prior to suturing. The recommended dose that we will incorporate is 14cc to deliver 400mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]/12mg meloxicam. Following standard sterile practice, the prepackaged , sterile medication kit will be brought to the surgical field for instillation prior 
to closure. The medication is a viscous solution supplied as a kit consisting of single dose glass vial and the following sterile components: Luer Lock syringe, a vented vial spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], Luer Lock cone-shaped applicator(s) and syringe tip cap(s). Per the manufacturer’s complete prescribing information materials, the contents of the drug vial are sterile. The vial exterior is 
not sterile. We will follow standard institutional practice to sterilely prepare  and administer 
this medication for surgery.   
 For the control/standard of care group receiving our standard arthroplasty block cocktail, the surgeon will instill the medication as an injectate into the posterior capsule, and soft tissues, during closure.   Per the manufacturer guidelines, the complete steps to prepare the medication are the following: https://www.zynrelef.com/prescribing -information.pdf

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
It has been shown that a reduction of 30% in NRS pain scores is associated with a meaningful benefit
12. Therefore, sample size calculations were performed to estimate the 
number of subjects needed to detect a difference of this magnitude or greater  between the 
two study groups.  In a similar study4, patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that 
received  HTX -011 + ropi[INVESTIGATOR_57281] a mean area under the curve (AUC) pain score from [ADDRESS_62440] deviation of 194.1.  A difference of 136 represents a 
30% change relative to 452.5. Enrollment of [ADDRESS_62441] non-compliance with completing or returning the diaries. However, a ssuming similar 
variability is observed in the above proposed study, only 44 subjects  with completed diaries per group (88 total) will be required to have 90% power to detect a difference of at least 136 in the AUC of NRS pain scores from 0 to 72 hours between the two study groups.

therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57285]. Outcomes measured on a continuous scale will be compared 
between the 2 study groups using two- sample t -tests if the data are sufficiently normally 
distributed; otherwise non- parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used. Ordinal variables 
will be analyzed using non- parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests.  Binary and nominal 
categorical outcomes will be compared between the study groups using chi -square tests or 
Fisher’s exact tests, if low expected cell counts are observed. Analysis of the primary outcome (AUC
0-72) will be analyzed both with and without accounting for the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_57286].  The former will be performed by [CONTACT_57314][INVESTIGATOR_57287]
4. Since this is a prospective, randomized trial, subjects in the two groups are 
expected to be similar with respect to their baseline characteristics; therefore, no formal comparisons of baseline data will be performed. However, if it is determined that an a djusted 
analysis is warranted, this will be done using a general linear models framework. The primary analysis will be conducted using an intent -to-treat approach in which subjects will be analyzed 
in the groups they were randomized to, even if they actually received the intervention for the other study group.  All statistical tests will be two -sided , and the threshold of statistical 
significance will be set at α = 0.05.  
 Handling of Missing Data If a subject ’s pain diary is missing a recording of their pain level or opi[INVESTIGATOR_57288] a 
particular four hour time point after POD 1, we will assess the quality of the rest of the data provided. If sufficient data is deemed available for inclusion, missing NRS pain scores will 
Periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + meloxicam ER solution vs Standard Practice During TKA: An 
RCT  
  Version 2.[ADDRESS_62445]  will be excluded from 
the analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_57315].   Multiplicity  
Given the study design and outcome definitions, multiplicity will not be an issue.  The serial NRS pain scores will be converted into a single measure of pain as the area under the curve (AUC) over the [ADDRESS_62446]. The analysis will entail comparison of the outcomes between the two study groups.  Therefore, there will be no analyses involving multiple comparisons.  
 
Primary Hypothesis:  The primary research hypothesis is that subjects randomized to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + meloxicam ER solution instilled periarticular at the time of total knee arthroplasty will have superior analgesia over the first [ADDRESS_62447]  
arthroplasty block.   This hypothesis will be tested by [CONTACT_57316] (AUC) for numerical rating scale (NRS) of pain over the first 72 hours following surgery between the two study groups using two- sample t- tests if the data are sufficiently normally distributed , or non-
parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests  if a high degree of non-normality is observed.  The 
primary analysis will be conducted using an intent- to-treat approach in which subjects will be

intervention for the other study group. A secondary per-protocol analysis may also be performed.  
 Secondary Hypothesis:   
The secondary research hypotheses include the following. 
• Subjects randomized to HTX-[ADDRESS_62448] arthroplasty block.  
• Subjects randomized to HTX-[ADDRESS_62449] arthroplasty block.  
• Subjects randomized to HTX-[ADDRESS_62450] arthroplasty block.  
The secondary hypotheses will be compared between the two study groups using two- sample 
t-tests; however, if the data are not sufficiently normally distributed for any of these 
outcomes, the comparisons will be performed using non- parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests.   
 Interim Analysis  
Inasmuch as patient accrual is expected to be rapid and the study follow-up period is only [ADDRESS_62451]-surgery, an interim analysis is not likely to be beneficial. Therefore, no interim analysis will be performed.

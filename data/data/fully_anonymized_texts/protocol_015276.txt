The urgent and essential next step of this work is to translate these discoveries to human s 
in a clinical investigation.  This p ilot study in humans will focus on feasibility  and safety. Our 
central hypothesis is that driving gamma via sensory flicker will be feasible and tolerable.  Our secondary hypothesis is driving gamma alters the brain’s immune cells  and amyloid beta 
processing . The primary outcomes will be feasibility and tolerability.  Exploratory measures 
will include amyloid  and immune signals in the CSF  and brain  and alterations in cerebral 
blood flow, as seen through arterial spin- labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  
 
2. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
2.1Aim 1. Assess the safety, and tolerability of gamma flicker and subject compliance.  
We will determine in 10 subjects with a diagnosis of MCI whether flicker exposure for 1 hour 
every day is well tolerated and whether subjects comply with the study procedures.  I n 
addition, we will closely monitor the safety of this procedure and document the occurrence 
of any adverse events.  
2.2Aim 2. Assess effects of driving gamma  on blood flow in patients with MCI. Blood 
flow decreases very early in Alzheimer’s  disease and this decrease is thought to lead to 
amyloid build up and functional deficits .14,15 We will determine if gamma flicker increases 
blood flow in Alzheimer’s patients. We will perform these tests in approximately 10 patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in collaboration with Dr.’s Lah and Levey and the Emory 
BHC/ADRC. These pi[INVESTIGATOR_65815]’s patients in a clinical trial.   
2.3 Aim 3. Assess effects of driving gamma  on amyloid beta levels and inflammation 
markers in patients with MCI. We will assess amyloid beta levels in the brain (florbetapir 
PET), cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (Aß42 Luminex assay), the current gold standards in th e field, and 
in the retina (Neurovision), a new approach currently being validated at the Emory Brain Health Center. We will also assess inflammatory markers in the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (OLink inflammatory panel). We will perform these tests in 10 patients with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI), as determined by [CONTACT_65838] (BHC)/ Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC).  
 
 
3. PRELIMINARY DATA  
 
3.1 Current work in huma ns– Cognito Therapeutics has licensed the technology from MIT 
to transition this work to humans. The company will provide the flicker devices for

  6 conducting the study here at Emory. The device is similar to sunglasses and is both 
comfortable and easy to use (Figure 3 , redacted).  
 
 
Initial human studies of patients with cognitive impairments have demonstrated that 
sensory stimulation can be safely delivered and is well -tolerated. Three clinical studies 
have been sponsored by [CONTACT_65837], which have been conducted under IRB 
approval (non- significant risk designation) and with good clinical practice (GCP) using a 
combination of non- invasive sensory stimulation systems in patients with cognitive 
impairments. These studies used three sensory stimulation modalities: visual, auditory, and 
tactile. For the visual and auditory stimulation, the Visual Flicker Unit (COG -VSU001) and 
Auditory Click Unit (COG -ASU001) were utilized, which have similar output light intensity, 
sound volume, repetition rate (40 cycles/second), and duty cycle t o the Gamma  Sense 
Stimulation System  that will be used for this study . For the tactile stimulation, 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was delivered to the palm of the hand using the Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Unit (COG -NSU001). Tactile s timulation is not 
included in the clinical investigation described by [CONTACT_3181].

4. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS  
4.1 Overview:  For this 9-week study, 10 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (amnestic 
or multi -domain subtypes) will be randomly assigned to two study arms. Although all 
participants will receive Flicker exposure, half of the participants will receive the exposure 
(driving gamma) during the entire study period (8 weeks  of Flicker ) while the other half of 
the participants will receive Flicker exposure  for half of the study  period (2nd 4-
weeks ).During the 9-week course of the study, participants will undergo venous blood 
draws and lumbar puncture for biomarker analyses at baseline, midpoint and at 9 weeks . At 
the study week 4 time point, the participants currently undergoing Flicker exposure will 
continue with their sessions while at week 4,  those initially randomized to non-exposure will 
initiate Flicker exposure.  The primary goals are to measure safety and FLICKER tolerance  
while  verify ing the intended response. Secondary objectives include monitor ing possible 
effects of Flicker exposure on clinical findings and biomarkers of AD progression, including 
CSF amyloid, tau, and phospho- tau, and volumetric MRI, as well as PET  (florbetapir)  and 
arterial spin labeling MRI  and retinal amyloid changes . 
 4.2 Sample Size and Power.  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_65816]. Although the sample size of 10 subjects will allow us to 
make certain claims about tolerability, we do not anticipate generating clinically meaningful, 
  FLICKER Protocol 
Protocol: v07   
Date: 04NOV2019  
  [ADDRESS_71700] undergone daily periods of  sensory stimulation for up to one 
hour (the study paradigm planned for this work) . These subjects include young adults, older 
adults, and older adults with cognitive impairmen ts. The se studies have helped establish 
the feasibility of sensory stimulation with regards to safety, comfort, and tolerability of the exposure in patients with mild -to-moderate cognitive impairments. No device or exposure-
related adverse events have been reported during this study.  
 4.4 Future research samples.  Per participan t consent, blood, cell lines and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_65817], potential 
development of new biomarkers, and potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. 
Samples may also be used to deal with future safety issues for Mild Cognitive Impairment 
or Alzheimer’s disease that are not presently known. These stored samples may also be 
used for genetic (DNA) research.

7. PATIENT SELECTION 
7.1 Recruitment Plan . The Emory ADRC has a large clinical practice and clinical research 
registry of subjects interested in participating in research studies. As of December 2017, the ADRC registry has an enrollment of 447 participants, among them 110 with MCI. The 
MCI participants include 100 individuals  with amnestic MCI (sing le or multiple domain). 
These ADRC participants have annual research evaluations that include detailed cognitive assessments, and all have consented to be contact[CONTACT_65842].  In addition to the existing pool of ADRC participants, the Emory memory disorders clini cs, staffed by [CONTACT_6283]. Levey, Lah , and other specialty -trained health 
professionals provide evaluation and treatment ~2000 patients annually, of whom ~500 are new visits (and ~100 MCI).

  [ADDRESS_71709] Identification Number at that time . The participant  will keep the same 
number throughout the study (a separate randomization number will not be provided). 
7.5 Randomization 
To achieve balanced patient groups, subjects will be randomly assigned on a 1:[ADDRESS_71710] and appropriate 
others (family, study partner) and if they are interested in learning more about the study they will be provided with a copy of the informed consent form to review in detail. The potential participant  will be contact[CONTACT_6811] a later date to determine if they would like to be 
screened f or possible  study  inclusion. If they are interested, a screening visit will be 
scheduled. Potential subjects are encouraged to discuss participation in this study with their 
family  prior to screening for the study.  In addition, they are encouraged to contact  [CONTACT_65849].  
At the time of the screening visit , the consent form will be reviewed with the study subject 
and appropriate others, and all questions will be answered . Ample opportunity will be given 
for questions. If they are sti ll interested in participating once  all questions are answered to 
participant and study partner satisfaction, the consent is signed.  
This study includes subjects who must score between >15 on the MoCA  (Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment ) and will therefore be experiencing mild cognitive impairment as a 
result of  suspected prodromal  Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with mild impairment will 
likely be a ble to provide informed consent. Capacity for consent will be determined by [CONTACT_65850]’s ability to engage in a discussion regarding the study and their ability to understand what will be involved in study participation. The individual obtaining consent will review and discuss the research project and the consent document with the potential study participant and their family/study partner/legally authorized representative and will decide if they are able to understand the nature of the research, appreciate the experimental nature 
of the study, and understand the potential risks as well as alternatives to st udy 
participation.  
In the event that the subject is not competent to provide consent, assent is obtained.  A 
study subject’s legally authorized representative will be present during the initial consenting process. Signed consent will be obtained from all participants and their study partners . The 
same process described previously will be employed in obtaining legally authorized 
  FLICKER Protocol 
Protocol: v07   
Date: 04NOV2019  
  12 representative’s consent, when deemed necessary.  Consent will be obtained prior to 
conducting any screening assessments or procedures.  
Participants under consideration for participation will have a diagnosis of MCI through the cognitive clinic or through consensus diagnosis as a participant in another of our research studies. Those who do not meet criteria for amnestic MCI will not be considered for participation.

  19 9. DATA RECORDING, RETENTION, AND MONITOR ING 
9.1 Electronic Case Report Forms  
Electronic Case Report Forms will be completed for each patient who signs Informed  
Consent. All clinical information requested in this protocol will be recorded on the eCRFs. If 
an error is made on documents collected (source documents) , a single line will be drawn  
through the error and the correct response will be written adjacent to the error; the change will be initialed and dated.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_71716]. A file for each patient will be maintained that includes the signed ICF and the 
Investigator’s  copi[INVESTIGATOR_65829]. The Investigator 
will ensur e the reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on 
the CRF was derived.  
 
Study documentation will be maintained, including documents  created or modified in 
electronic format, for at least 15 years following the completion of  the study. ICFs, and 
adequate records for the receipt and disposition of all study drugs  will be retained for a 
period of 2 years following the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory  
approval date of the drug or until 2 years after the drug investigational program is 
discontinued, unless a longer period is required by [CONTACT_65855].  
10. ASSAY MEASURES AND ANALYSES  
 10.1Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_65830] E4 allele status will be performed in the Emory 
Genetics Core facility.   Apolipoprotein E4 allele status will not be disclosed to study 
participants . 
 10.2 EEG. We will measure electrical brain activity using EEG from the scalp . For the EEG 
recording session, a cap (similar to a swim cap) will be placed on the participant’s head and 
electrodes attached. Gel will be placed on the hair/head so that the electrodes can get a 
good connection to detect electrical charges that come from brain activity. This gel is easily 
removed with hair washing.  
 During the EEG study session, you will be seated in a chair. You will be asked to rest 
quietly with your eyes open. EEG will be recorded before, during and after use of the Flicker device  (Figure  3). When the Flicker device is not in place, participants may be 
asked to perform simple movements, to perform a computer/ iPad-based  task with button 
presses, and/or to complete mood and cognitive assessment questionnaires.  
 
  FLICKER Protocol 
Protocol: v07   
Date: 04NOV2019  
  [ADDRESS_71717] up to 3 hours total time (including electrode 
placement and recording time) and will occur at 3 time points  during the study: baseline, 
midpoint, and end- of-study. 
 EEG evaluation will be performed at Visits 1a and  2b for both groups to determine whether 
it is possible to entrain the gamma waves.  If subjects’ brain waves are unable to become 
entrained, they will be removed from the study.   Screening EEG may be repeated if 
entrainment criteria are not met  or data are unreliable in subjects who have met all other 
eligibility criteria.  
 
 10.3 Lumbar Puncture (LP ): Lumbar puncture will be performed by a qualified clinician 
trained to perform the procedure. 20ml of CSF is collected using sterile technique and will be assayed for both known and novel biomarkers of disease, including inflammatory markers. Lumbar punctures will occur at the three in- person clinic visits ( screening, 
midpoint , and end of study).  
 10.4 CSF and Serum Biomarkers.  AD biomarkers including Aß42, tau, and phospho- tau 
levels in the CSF will be assayed at baseline, midpoint , and end of study  visits. Specialty 
assays for inflammatory  markers will also be conducted via a commercial vendor with 
specialized panels for measuring these markers (OLink, Sweden). Results are not disclosed to participants.  
 10.[ADDRESS_71718] meets eligibility criteria.  
  
The 3T MR acquisition sequences will include all, or a subset of, the following 1) Structural 
MRI, 2) FLAIR ,3) T2*GRE;  4) arterial spin labeling (ASL), and 5)  resting state 
connectivity.  MRI measure ments of brain structure have been show to demonstrate brain 
atrophy (which correlates with neuron loss) in MCI and AD and increasing rates of brain atrophy as subjects become more impaired.   Therefore, structural MRI is used as a 
measure of t he rate of disease progression in AD treatment trials.   Structural MRI 
(MPRAGE//IRSPGR) data will be used both as the rate of change as well as a predictor of future change.   Cerebrovascular disease (especially white matter lesions (WMLs) will be 
assessed with FLAIR.   Cerebral blood flow, which closely correlates with cerebral 
hypometabolism as an early biomarker of AD pathogenesis, will be measured by [CONTACT_65856].  Finally, resting state fMRI will be used to determine functional connectivity 
changes .  
  FLICKER Protocol 
Protocol: v07   
Date: 04NOV2019  
  21 All MRIs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_65857].  
  
10.6 PET Scan.  The PET scan includes injection of florbetapir (10 mCi  [+/- 10%]) 
administered by [CONTACT_65858]. During the 50- minute uptake phase, 
participants will wait in a quiet room. The PET scan will begin at approximately [ADDRESS_71719]-florbetapir injection. Brain images will be acquired continuously for a period of 20- 40 
minutes (scan time based on scan quality and the need for repeat sequences).  
 
10.7 Cognitive testing. Cognitive testing will occur at the baseline  visit for each 
participant . A series of pen and paper or computer -based tests are administered to assess 
the current cognitive status (tests listed under Baseline visit 2b) . At visit 1a, only the MoCA 
will be administered to determine eligibility.  
 
10.8 Study questionnaires . Interviews will be conducted at each of the three time  points in 
the study : baseline, midpoint , and at end- of-study. These questionnaires are conducted 
with the study partner and are meant to assess subjective impressions of the participant’s 
current behaviors and level of function. One questionnaire (the Clinical Dementia Rating  
[CDR] ) also asks questions of the participant and helps to offer insight into their current 
beliefs about their cognitive status.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
 
Although this study is meant to assess tolerability and feasibility  of Flicker exposure in the 
study population, there is a small chance that we will also obtain preliminary data that reflects clinical impact. However, this study is not powered to obtain generalizable results and the data will instead be used as pi[INVESTIGATOR_65831] a larger, early -phase 
clinical trial.  
11.  OPEN-LABEL EXTENSION  
 
Participants who complete  the clinical trial phase of the study  will be eligible to participate in 
the open- label extension phase.  
 
Subjects who elect to participate in the open- label phase will be asked to sign  a new 
consent form (after the investigator or study coordinator has explained procedures for the open- label phase of the trial and after all participant questions have been addressed).  
 Participants who elect to participate in the extension phase will be  required to come to the 
clinic at 6 and 12 months.  Flicker administration will continue throughout these visits and be 
terminated only after Visit 15b.  At 6 months (Visit 13), the following procedures will be performed:  
• AE review  
• Concomitant medication review  
  FLICKER Protocol 
Protocol: v07   
Date: 04NOV2019  
  22 • Vital sign collection  
• Physical and neurological exams  
• CDR, NPI [INVESTIGATOR_65832] 2 intervals between the clinic visits (Visits 12 and 14), the subjects will be contact[CONTACT_5143], during which time AEs and concomitant medications will be reviewed.  
 At Visit 15a and 15b, the following procedures will be performed:  
• AE review  
• Concomitant medication review  
• Vital sign collection  
• Physical and neurological exams  
• Cognitive assessments – those performed in visit 11a  
• MRI 
• Amyloid PET scan  (optional)  
• Lumbar puncture (optional)  
• EEG evaluation  
• Tolerance testing  
• Eye tracking  
• Retinal imaging  
• Blood draw  
 Subjects will be given the option to undergo the PET scan and the LP at Visit 15.  They may elect to undergo both procedures or only one; they are required to undergo at least one of these procedures.  
 The EOS visit (Visit 16) will be conducted by [CONTACT_65859], during which medications and 
AEs will be reviewed.

Purified Inactivated Zika Virus Vaccine (PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760])
Trial No. ZIK -101 Page 6of 108
Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
2.0 Interim Analys ies:
A first interim analysis will be performed to include immunogenicity and 
safety data from all flavivirus naïve subjects up to Visit 6 (on Day 57, [ADDRESS_208869] dose 2); a second interim analysis will be performed for dose 
selection, and including safety data from all flavivirus primed subjects up to 
Visit 4 (on Day 29, [ADDRESS_208870] dose 1). This interim analysis is not intended 
for early termination of the trial. A second interim analysis will be performed 
to include the data describing the persistence of immunity at [ADDRESS_208871] dose 2.
Final Analysis:
The final safety and immunogenicity analysis will be performed when all 
(flavivirus naïve and primed) subjects have completed Visit 6 (Day 57) to provide data to support the planning and execution of other trials in the development plan of PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760]. 
The subsequent analyses will include (1) the data 
up to Visit 9 ([ADDRESS_208872] dose 2) and (2) the data up to Visit 11 ([ADDRESS_208873] dose 2). The analyses will be performed by a separate set of 
unblinded statisticians and programmers at a Clinical Research Organization 
(CRO), who will have access to individual treatment assignments and will not be involved in subsequent trial conduct. The study team at [COMPANY_005] will have 
access to the group level unblinded results and will remain blinded to the 
individual treatment assignment. The remaining personnel (not mentioned 
before) involved in the conduct of the trial, including those at [COMPANY_005], the CRO, and the trial sites, 
will remain blinded to the individual subject treatment 
assignment until unblinding after trial completion (database lock for data through Visit 11). More details regarding the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
The final study report will be written for the data up to Visit 6 (Day 57), and 
two additional addenda will be written: one to report the data from Visit 6 (Day 
57) to Visit 8 (Day 211, [ADDRESS_208874] dose 2) to Visit 9 (Day 393, [ADDRESS_208875] dose 2), and one to report the data from Visit 8 (Day 211) Visit 9 (Day 
393) until the end of the study, ie, Visit 11 (Day 757, [ADDRESS_208876] dose 2).

Purified Inactivated Zika Virus Vaccine (PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760])
Trial No. ZIK -[ADDRESS_208883] interim analysis will be performed to include immunogenicity and 
safety data from all flavivirus naïve subjects up to Visit 6 (on Day 57, 
[ADDRESS_208884] dose 2); a second interim analysis will be performed for dose 
selection, and i ncluding safety data from all flavivirus primed subjects up to 
Visit 4 (on Day 29, [ADDRESS_208885] dose 1). This interim analysis is not intended 
for early termination of the trial. A second interim analysis will be performed 
to include the data describing the persistence of immunity at [ADDRESS_208886] dose 2.
The final safety and immunogenicity analysis will be performed when all 
(flavivirus naïve and primed) subjects have completed Visit 6 (Day 57) to provide data to support the planning and execution of other trials in the development plan of PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760]. 
The subsequent analyses will include (1) the data 
up to Visit 9 ([ADDRESS_208887] dose 2) and (2) the data up to Visit 11 ([ADDRESS_208888] dose 2). The analyses will be performed by a separate set of 
unblinded statisticians and programmers at a Clinical Research Organization 
(CRO), who will have access to individual treatment assignments and will not be involved in subsequent trial conduct. The study team at [COMPANY_005] will have access to the group level unblinded results and will remain blinded to the individual treatment assignment. The remaining personnel (not mentioned before) involved in the conduct of the trial, including those at [COMPANY_005], the 
CRO, and the trial sites, will remain blinded to the individual subject treatment 
assignment until unblinding after trial completion (database lock for data through Visit 11).
More details regarding the analyses will be provided in the SAP.The final study report will be written for the data up to Visit 6 (Day 57), and 
two additional addenda will be written: one to report the data from Visit 6 (Day 
57) to Visit 8 (Day 211, [ADDRESS_208889] dose 2) to Visit 9 (Day 393, [ADDRESS_208890] dose 2), and one to report the data from Visit 8 (Day 211) Visit 9 (Day

Trial No. ZIK -[ADDRESS_208909] Name:
[CONTACT_178089] (PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760]) candidate (TAK -426)
Trial Title: A Phase 1, Randomized, Observer -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Safety, Immunogenicity, and Dose 
Ranging Study of Purified Inactivated Zika Virus Vaccine (PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760]) Candidate in Flavivirus Naïve and Primed HealthyAdults Aged 18 to 49 Years
IND No.: [ADDRESS_208910] No.: Not applicable
Study Identifier: ZIK-101 Phase: 1 Trial Blinding Schema: Observer -blind
Background and Rationale:
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne single-stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus which belongs to 
the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus, that presents structural similarities with other members of the Flaviviridae , 
including Spondweni virus, Yellow Fever (YF) virus, Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus, and Tick-borne Encephalitis virus.
ZIKV was discovered in [ADDRESS_208911] Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and was considered a rare 
disease with mild symptoms; only [ADDRESS_208912] large outbreak of ZIKV disease was reported in Yap Island (Federal state of Micronesia) in 2007, and was 
followed by [CONTACT_177912] 2013-2014. The first cases of ZIKV disease in South America were 
reported in Easter Island in 2014, and the first reports of locally transmitted infection (ie, by [CONTACT_930]) came from Brazil in Ma y 2015, which triggered the third outbreak in [ADDRESS_208913] been estimates of more than 750,000 ZIKV -suspected cases reported from more than 
60countries/territories; most of these cases are from the South America continent.
The primary mode of transmission of ZIKV is through the bite of female mosquitoes, prominently Aedes aegypti and 
Ae. albopi[INVESTIGATOR_177761]. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy and the 
perinatal period, sexual contact, and blood transfusion are also confirmed modes of transmission of the disease. Potentially, the virus could be transmitted through laboratory exposure and by [CONTACT_177913], eg, tears, urine, 
breast milk, or through solid organ transplants, but there is limited evidence to support this.
More than 80% of ZIKV infections remain asymptomatic, and for the symptomatic cases, the disease is in general 
mild and of short duration. Some clinical manifestations include, but are not limited to, mild fever, maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_177762], ZIKV infection during pregnancy has been associated with 
serious outcomes for the fetus and newborn. The severity of the disease is related to the consequences in the fetus and 
newborn child from women with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. The spectrum of congenital anomalies associated 
with ZIKV infection, known as Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) , consists of severe microcephaly with partially 
collapsed skull, cerebral cortices with subcortical calcifications, macular scarring and focal pi[INVESTIGATOR_177763], congenital contractures, and marked early hypertonia with symptoms of extrapyramidal involvement. The exposure to ZIKV at any moment during pregnancy is a risk for fetal or postnatal developmental complications , 
primarily affecting brain development . Recent analysi s of the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry (USZPR) showed that the 
prevalence of newborns with congenital defects from pregnancies with laboratory-confirmed ZIKV infection is 10% 
(95% CI: 7%-14%). This is [ADDRESS_208914] been 3 689confirmed C ZS 
malformations potentially associated with ZIKV infection in 27 countries and territories of Latin America and the 
Caribbean.
ZIKV is a neurotropic flavivirus that can potentially cause disease within the central nervous system. Worldwide

concern over ZIKV causing Guillain -Barré syndrome ( GBS )emerged when an increased number of GBS cases was 
temporally associated with the 2013- [ADDRESS_208916] ZIKV, compared to 56% in the control group. Other 
neurological complications, such as encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, paresthesia, facial paralysis and myelitis, have 
also been associated with ZIKV infection. Based on these findings, the countries affected by [CONTACT_177916] 
2015-[ADDRESS_208917] increased 2 
to 9.8 times compared to baseline before the epi[INVESTIGATOR_903], and up to 20 times in French Polynesia. The 
association of GBS was only reported when the circulating strain was of Asian lineage. As of 01 February 2017, ZIKV 
of the Asian lineage was circulating in more than 80% of affected countries, including [ADDRESS_208918] ZIKV is currently available. As 
the disease is self-limiting, treatment for uncomplicated ZIKV infection is supportive and focuses on symptoms. The 
main recommendations to address outbreaks are through prevention (avoiding mosquito bites, reducing sexual 
transmission, improving the procedures for safe blood transfusion), and vector control measures. 
The risk of infection with ZIKV is increasing given that the spread of ZIKV is rapid and intense in tropi[INVESTIGATOR_177766]. Vector control is difficult to establish and maintain, and new areas continue to be colonized by [CONTACT_177917]. Climate changes may also create favorable environments to maintain the vector. There is an 
increased urban population and mobility, and the role of sexual transmission may be an important mechanism to spread rapi[INVESTIGATOR_177767], even in regions where the vector is uncommon.
ZIKV has posed a challenging situation for health, public and economic sectors of affected countries. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) declared on 01 February 2016 the Zika outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended to focus the research on the causal association of ZIKV infection 
during pregnancy and microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities in newborns. By [CONTACT_58472] 2016, the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services declared Zika a public health emergency in Puerto Rico based on the 
significant threat to pregnant women and their children’s health. In November 2016, and after evaluating the evidence 
about the causal association of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities in newborns, WHO announced that Zika no longer represents a PHEIC but stressed the need to escalate the disease to a sustained work program with dedicated resources to address its long-term nature and its associated consequences.
Considering the conclusive associations between ZIKV infections and fetal and postnatal abnormalities, the 
development of a vaccine that can provide protection is crucial for countries where the epi[INVESTIGATOR_177768]/or persist, as well as in countries in which the virus has not yet been introduced . In order to address the urgent 
medical need and in anticipation of possible outbreaks with rapid onsets, [COMPANY_005] has initiated the development of a purified inactivated ZIKV vaccine candidate, PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760], for use in endemic areas and non-endemic areas for prevention of 
ZIKV associated illness of any severity and/or infection.
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) from the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is providing funding to [COMPANY_005] for 
the US-based PI[INVESTIGATOR_177769]. Due to the need to vaccinate women and men of reproductive age, the target population of PI[INVESTIGATOR_177770] 9 years of age and older. In this phase 1 study, study population is limited to ≥ 18to 
≤49years of age, and age expansion will be included in the next phase of development.

Trial No. ZIK -[ADDRESS_208922] phase of the study. If positive recommendations from an 
external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) are issued following the review of safety and tolerability data in this 
population, when the last flavivirus naïve subject has completed study Visit 4 ([ADDRESS_208923] dose 1), vaccination of 
flavivirus primed subjects will start.
Due to the ongoing threat of ZIKV disease and the urgent need of a vaccine, this phase 1 study will be accelerated to 
assess dose finding for PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760], in addition to evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. PI[INVESTIGATOR_177778]-naïve and primed subjects, and geometric 
mean titers (GMT) of neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibody levels at [ADDRESS_208924] dose 2 in flavivirus naïve subjects. 
Placebo serves as the control for the study vaccine and in the absence of effective treatment or prevention for ZIKV 
disease, the use of placebo in this trial is justified.
The rationale for the observer-blind approach is based on the different physical appearance of the investigational 
vaccine compared to the saline solution placebo that was selected and preferred to alum-containing placebo to avoid 
side effects associated with alum.
All enrolled subjects will receive two 0.5mL doses of either PI[INVESTIGATOR_177779] (IM) on Day [ADDRESS_208925] a single vaccine dose level from three 
different antigen concentrations (2, 5 or 10 µg) for further development. 
The primary rationale for selection of the three vaccine dose levels can be summarized as follows: 
the low-dose level (2 µg) was selected for purposes of potentially identify an immunological threshold, and 
was based on the limit of the analytical methods for the drug product available at the time;
the mid-dose level (5 µg) was selected to provide a mid-point on the dose response curve. In addition, this 
dose level is based on the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) vaccine currently tested in Phase 1, which was originally based on initial studies in non-human primates (NHPs); and
the high-dose level (10 µg) was selected to follow an approximate 2-fold range and to further define the 
potential dose-response curve in both naïve and primed subjects.
The trial will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals (ICH) GCP Guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements.
Trial Design:
This is a phase 1, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, immunogenicity, and dose ranging study of PI[INVESTIGATOR_177780]ïve and primed healthy adults aged ≥18 to ≤[ADDRESS_208926] for up to 2 weeks (14 days) prior to randomization, with the possibility that some subjects (Flavivirus primed subjects only) will need to repeat some screening procedures if they were not randomized right after the screening period (further clarification is provided in the schedule of trial procedures).
Flavivirus naïve subjects: subjects without detectable serum antibodies against a panel of flaviviruses, as measured by 
a reactive antibody based assay (Luminex). 
Flavivirus primed subjects: subjects with serum antibodies against a panel of flavivirus es, as measured by a reactive 
antibody based assay (Luminex).
Approximately 240 subjects aged ≥18 to ≤49 years will be enrolled and equally randomized into four groups (1:1:1:1) 
of approximately 60 subjects, each comprised of approximately 30 flavivirus naïve subjects and approximately 
30flavivirus primed subjects. Randomization within each cohort (flavivirus naïve versus flavivirus primed subjects) 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_177919]: ≥18 to ≤ 29 years versus ≥30 to ≤49 years .

These flavivirus primed subjects will consequently undergo 2 screening visits: Visit 1A during the first phase of the study, and Visit 1B at the outset of the second phase of the study. 
Flavivirus primed subjects identified at Screening Visit 1A who do not participate in the second phase of the 
study will be declared screened failure (see Figure 2.b

Enrollment will be put on hold after all naïve subjects have been enrolled and will resume when positive 
recommendations from the external DMC are issued, as described above.
The second phase of the study will be aimed at enrolling flavivirus primed subjects only.Newly identified eligible flavivirus primed subjects at Screening Visit 1B will be enrolled (randomized) at 
(second phase) Visit 2, within two weeks after Screening Visit 1B.
Previously identified flavivirus primed subjects (see Figure 2.b
§§) (who were tested at Screening Visit 1A 
during the first phase and accepted to enter the second phase of the study) will retain their initial subject identification (ID) number and undergo an additional screening visit (Visit 1B) to be tested for eligibility 
criteria again (except for the determination of flavivirus serostatus). 
Flavivirus naïve subjects identified at Screening Visit 1B (during the second phase of the study) will be 
declared screened failure (see Figure 2.b

Flavivirus naïve subjects identified during the Screening Visit 1A and flavivirus primed subjects identified during the Screening Visit 1B will attend 7 visits and will receive 1 phone call, and possibly 2 additional 
visits and 1 phone call (thus a maximum of 9 visits and 2 phone calls) if they were randomized to the placebo 
group or the PI[INVESTIGATOR_177786] 
Flavivirus primed subjects identified during the Screening Visit 1A will attend 8 visits (including Visit 1A 
andVisit 1B) and will receive 1 phone call, and possibly 2 additional visits and 1 phone call (thus a maximum 
of 10 visits and 2 phone calls) if they were randomized to the placebo group or the PI[INVESTIGATOR_177787](s) (Visit 1A and/or Visit 1B), Visit 2 at Day 1, Visit 3 at 
Day 8 (7days post dose 1), Visit 4 at Day 29 ([ADDRESS_208936] dose 1), Visit 5 at Day 36 ([ADDRESS_208937] dose 2), Visit 6 at

Blood samples will be collected at each site visit: ie, at Screening Visit(s) (Visit 1A and/or Visit 1B) for flavivirus serostatus determination and eligibility screening tests (including pregnancy testing), at Visits 3 and 5 for routine safety laboratory testing, and at Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, and (for subjects who will be randomized to the placebo group or the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_177789] ) 9 and 11 for immunogenicity, as well as for further 
development and characterization of assays.
Urine samples will be collected for all subjects at Screening Visit(s) (Visit 1A and/or Visit 1B) for eligibility screening 
and at Visits 3 and 5 for routine safety laboratory testing; and for women of childbearing potential at Visits 2 and 4 
before each investigational vaccine/placebo administration for pregnancy testing. 
Each subject will receive diary cards to collect solicited adverse events (AEs) for 7 days after each dose (including the 
days of vaccine/placebo administration), and unsolicited AEs for 28 days after each dose (includ ing the days of 
vaccine/placebo administration). Additional safety assessments will include new medical conditions (neurological and 
neuroinflammatory disorders) with onset after the first vaccination, and serious adverse events (SAEs) collection for 
the duration of the entire trial. Immunogenicity will be assessed for all subjects 28 days after each vaccine/placebo administration and [ADDRESS_208940] dose 2.

Trial No. ZIK -101 Page 23of 108
Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
Statistical Considerations:
Analysis sets :
Safety Set : The Safety Set will consist of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the 
inves tigational vaccine/placebo. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS will include all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of 
the investigational vaccine/placebo and provided valid baseline and at least one post-vaccination serology 
result. Subjects will be included in the FAS analysis as randomized.
Per–Protocol Set (PPS): The PPS will include all subjects in the FAS who have no major protocol violations. 
The major protocol violation criteria will be defined as part of the blinded data review prior to the unblinding 
of subject’s investigational vaccine/placebo assignment. The categories of major protocol violations include: 
1 not meeting selected entry criteria, 
2 receiving a wrong investigational vaccine/placebo, 3 receiving prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 4 other major protocol violations that may be identified during blinded data reviews.
All summaries and analyses of safety data will be based on subjects in the Safety Set. 
The primary immunogenicity analyses will be based on the PPS, and additional immunogenicity analyses will be 
based on the FAS.
Analysis of demographics and other baseline characteristics: Summaries of age, gender, race, and other baseline 
characteristics will be presented by [CONTACT_177931].
Immunogenicity analysis : Descriptive statistics for the primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoints, including 
estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for GMT, SPR and SCR, will be provided by [CONTACT_7206] ( 28days 
post dose 1, 28days post dose 2, and 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_208959] dose 2 in applicable groups) and by [CONTACT_177931]. 
Point estimates and 95% CI for ratios in GMT and differences in SPR and SCR will be provided for each pair of active 
study arms to aid a single vaccine dose level selection. Immunogenicity summaries and analyses will be provided by 
[CONTACT_177932] , as well as by [CONTACT_177933]. 
Seropositive subjects : Subjects with detectable serum antibodies (tested positive at or above limit of 
detection, LOD) as measured by [CONTACT_177934].
Seronegative subjects: Subjects with no detectable serum antibodies (test results are below LOD) as 
measured by [CONTACT_177934] . 
Seroconverted subjects : Seronegative subjects at baseline with detectable post-vaccination serum antibodies
(test results are at or above LOD) and seropositive subjects at baseline with different fold increases in post-vaccination antibodies from baseline, as measured by [CONTACT_177934].
Safety Analysis: Reactogenicity will be assessed for 7 days following each dose (including day of vaccine/placebo 
administration) via daily collection of solicited AEs, including local reactions (injection site: pain, erythema, swelling, and induration) and systemic AEs of headache, fatigue, malaise, arthralgia and myalgia. In addition, body temperature 
(preferably measured as oral temperature) as indicator of reactogenicity will be collected (with fever defined as body 
temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F).
For each solicited AE, including fever, the percentage of subjects will be summarized by [CONTACT_177935] 7 days afte r each vaccine/placebo administration and overall. For subjects with more than 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_177811], the maximum severity will be used for tabulations.
Unsolicited AEs and SAEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and 
summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each formulation arm including neurological and neuroinflammatory disorders and new medical conditions with onset after the first vaccination.
Safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_177932] , as well as by [CONTACT_177933].

Trial No. ZIK -101 Page 24of 108
Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
Sample Size Justification:
The sample size was not determined based on formal statistical power calculations.
Interim Analyse s:
A first interim analysis will be performed to include immunogenicity and safety data from all flavivirus naïve subjects 
up to Visit 6 ( on Day 57, [ADDRESS_208960] dose 2); a second interim analysis will be performed for dose selection,
including safety data from all flavivirus primed subjects up to Visit 4 (on Da y29, [ADDRESS_208961] dose 1). 
Final Analysis:
The final safety and immunogenicity analysis will be performed when all (flavivirus naïve and primed) subjects have 
completed Visit 6 (Day 57) to provide data to support the planning and execution of other trials in the development 
plan of PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760]. The subseq uent analyses will include (1) the data up to Visit 9 ([ADDRESS_208962] dose 2) and (2) the data 
up to Visit 11 ([ADDRESS_208963] dose 2). The analyses will be performed by a separate set of unblinded statisticians and 
programmers at a Clinical Research Organization (CRO), who will have access to individual treatment assignments 
and will not be involved in subsequent trial conduct. The study team at [COMPANY_005] will have access to the group level 
unblinded results and will remain blinded to the individual treatment assignment. The re maining personnel (not 
mentioned before) involved in the conduct of the trial, including those at [COMPANY_005], the CRO, and the trial sites, will remain blinded to the individual subject treatment assignment until unblinding after trial completion (database lock for data through Visit 11). More details regarding the analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
The final study report will be written for the data up to Visit 6 (Day 57), and two additional addenda will be written: 
one to report the data from Visit 6 (Day 57) to Visit 9 (Day 393, 12months post dose 2), and one to report the data 
from Visit 9 (Day 393) until the end of the study, ie, Visit 11(Day 757, [ADDRESS_208964] dose 2). 
External Data Monitoring Committe e:
An external DMC will have oversight of this trial. The external DMC functions at a program level.
The external DMC will consist of [ADDRESS_208965] 
completed Visit 4 ([ADDRESS_208966] dose 1) for the purpose of recommendation to start vaccinating flavivirus primed 
subjects. The external DMC will review safety data on an ongoing basis and when the following set of AEs are 
reported, the external DMC will review all relevant safety data within 48 hours and consider a possible pause of the 
study, if it deems necessary:
Two or more subjects develop the same grade 3 solicited AE starting within 7 days of vaccination
Two or more subjects develop the same grade 3 unsolicited AE within 28 days of vaccination
Any SAE 
Any unexpected, serious, or unanticipated risk to the subjects enrolled.
Further information is available in the external DMC charter.

Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
CONFIDENTIAL(b)Staggered enrollment: There will be two study phases
The first phase of the study will be aimed at enrolling flavivirus naïve subjects only (1).
All subjects who sign the ICF and have confirmed eligibility at Screening Visit 1A will be tested for flavivirus serostatus.
Eligible flavivirus naïve subjects enrolled at Screening Visit 1A(1)will be randomized at Visit 2, within two weeks after Screening Visit 1A.
Flavivirus primed subjects will not be enrolled during the first phase of the study (ie, when identified at Screening Visit 1A(2)) and will be invited to come 
back for the second phase of the study. They will be contact[CONTACT_177942]ïve subjects, when the last flavivirus naïve subject has completed study Visit 4 ([ADDRESS_208970] dose 1). These 
flavivirus primed subjects will consequently undergo 2 screening visits: Visit 1A during the first phase of the study, and Visit 1B at the outset of the second 
phase of the study. Flavivirus primed subjects identified at Screening Visit 1A who do not participate in the second phase of the study will be declared screened failure.Enrollment will be put on hold after all naïve subjects
(1)have been enrolled and will resume when positive recommendations from the external DMC are 
issued, as described above.
The second phase of the study will be aimed at enrolling flavivirus primed subjects only(2 and 3).
Newly identified eligible flavivirus primed subjects at Screening Visit 1B(3)will be enrolled (randomized) at (second phase) Visit 2, within two weeks after 
Screening Visit 1B.
Previously identified flavivirus primed subjects(2)(who were tested at Screening Visit 1A during the first phase and accepted to enter the second phase of the 
study) will retain their initial subject identification (ID) number and undergo an additional screening visit (Visit 1B) to be tested for eligibility criteria again 
(except for the determination of flavivirus serostatus). Flavivirus naïve subjects identified at Screening Visit 1B (during the second phase of the study) will be declared screened failure.
(c) If the subject has a temporary clinically significant active infection (as assessed by [CONTACT_093]) or temperature ≥38.0°C/100.4°F, within 3 days of intended 
investigational vaccine/placebo administration, the investigational vaccine/placebo administration may be delayed as per the assessment of the investigator within t he allowed visit window. The visit windows of Visit [ADDRESS_208971] vaccination. Following the same rule, 
the visit windows of Visit 5 and Visit 6 should be calculated from the day of the second vaccination.
(d)One single subject identification (ID) number will be assigned to each subject at Screening Visit (1A or 1B). Eligibility by [CONTACT_177943]/exclusion criteria will be documented before enrollment.
(e) Demographic information, to be obtained at Screening Visit (1A or 1B), will include age (date of birth), sex, race, and ethnicity as provided by [CONTACT_423].(f)Medical history will be collected at Screening Visit(s) (Visit 1A and/or Visit 1B) and at Visit 2 (Day 1) and will include any medical history that may be relevant to subject eligibility for trial participation such as prior vaccinations, concomitant medications, and previous and ongoing illnesses or injuries. 
Relevant medical history can also include any medical history that contributes to the understanding of an AE that occurs during trial participation, if it 
represents an exacerbation of an underlying disease/preexisting problem. Adverse occurrences before administration of the first dose of investigational 
vaccine/placebo are considered medical history.
(g)All medications, vaccines and blood products taken or received by [CONTACT_177944] 3 months prior to the start of the trial are to be recorded on the source 
document (patient record) and entered on the Prior and Concomitant Medications eCRF. The use of antipyretics and/or analgesic medications within [ADDRESS_208972] be identified and the reason for their use (prophylaxis versus treatment) must be described in the source documents and the eCRF.

performed if deemed necessary or indicated by [CONTACT_98272]’s medical history, should assess clinically significant changes from the baseline 
examination. The findings should be documented in the subject’s source document; findings consistent with the definition of AEs or SAEs (see Section 10.0) 
must be transcribed into the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). For any procedures at the site, the investigator shall follow his/her standard practice. Refer to 
Section 9.1.4 .
(i) Vital signs include (however, not limited to) systolic/diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature, and should be documented in the 
subject’s source document and transcribed into the eCRF. Follow standard of care for trial population and operational feasibility. Refer to Section 9.1.5 .
(j)Blood samples will be collected at each site visit: ie, at Screening Visit(s) (Visit 1A and/or Visit 1B) for flavivirus serostatus determination (approximately 10mL of blood) and eligibility screening tests (including pregnancy testing) (approximately 10 mL of blo od), at Visits 3 and 5 for routine safety laboratory 
testing (approximately 10 mL of blood) , and at Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, and ( for subjects who will be randomized to the placebo group or the PI[INVESTIGATOR_177812] ) 9 and 11 for immunogenicity, as well as for further development and characterization of assays (approximately 60 mL 
of blood) . Should a blood sampling be performed during a vaccination visit, this sampling must occur before the administration of the investigational vaccine or 
placebo. The maximum volume of blood taken at any single visit will be between approximately [ADDRESS_208973]’s flavivirus serostatus at screening and the vaccine dose level the 
subject received. All samples will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures. Blood samples will be processed and stored at the trial site as described in the provided Laboratory Manual. Refer to Section 9.1.6 .
(k)Urine samples will be collected for all subjects at Screening Visit(s) (Visit 1A and/or Visit 1B) and at Visits 3 and 5; and for women of childbearing potential 
at Visits 2 and 4 before each investigational vaccine/placebo administration for pregnancy testing. Urine samples for eligibility screening and routine safety 
laboratory testing will be sent to the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the study site using kits provided by [CONTACT_456].
(l) Serum pregnancy tests will be conducted in the central laboratory and urine pregnancy tests will be done at the study site using kits provided by [CONTACT_456] .
Subjects must have a negative urine -hCG pregnancy test prior to receiving any dose of investigational vaccine/placebo. Refer to Section 9.1.9 .
(m)If eligible, the subject will be randomized at Visit 2. Refer to Sections 9.1.3 and 9.1.10 .
(n)The investigational vaccine/placebo will be administered in the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm (approximately at the top middle third).
(o) After vaccine/placebo administration at Visit 2 (on Day 1) and at Visit 4 (Day 29), the subject will be observed for at least 30 minutes for observation of 
solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, and measurement of body temperature.
(p)Diary cards will be handed out to the subjects at Visits 2, 3, [ADDRESS_208974] and collected at the following visit. Refer to Section 9.3.4 .
(q)In case of early termination during the vaccination period only.
(r)After each dose, solicited AEs (for 7 days including the day of vaccine/placebo administration) and unsolicited AEs (for 28 days including the day of 
vaccine/placebo administration) will be collected on diary cards by [CONTACT_6992]. The investigator will transcribe these data into eCRF. Refer to Section 9.1.7 . 
(s)SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal from the trial or discontinuation of vaccine/placebo administration will be collected for the duration of the entire trial. 
SAEs will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. AEs leading to early termination will be recorded by [CONTACT_1275].
(t) Only for newly screened subjects at Screening Visit 1B (ie, not for flavivirus primed subjects who were tested at Screening Visit 1A and accepted to enter the 
second phase of the study).
(u)All subjects who were randomized to the placebo group or the PI[INVESTIGATOR_177788] 9 at Day 393 
(12months post dose 2) and Visit 11 at Day 757 ([ADDRESS_208975] dose 2), and will also be contact[CONTACT_177923] 575 (Visit 10) for safety follow- up.

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Zika Virus
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito -borne single -stranded positive -sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
virus (11 kb in size) (26)which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus , that often 
causes no or only mild symptoms, including a rash and a febrile flu -like illness in the majority of 
symptomatic individuals. The ZIKV virion shows icosahedral symmetry of its nucleocapsid (27)
and presents structural similarities with other members of the Flaviviridae , including Spondweni 
virus, Yellow Fever (YF) virus, Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese 
Encep halitis (JE) virus, and Tick -borne Encephalitis virus. The genome is translated into a single 
polyprotein subsequently cleaved by [CONTACT_177953] (capsid, 
pre-membrane/membrane and envelope) proteins that form the vir ion and seven non -structural 
proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5) (28).
ZIKV was discovered in [ADDRESS_208983] human disease cases were reported in 1952 in Uganda (29)and Tanzania (30). For as long as 
55years, the virus circulated in areas of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and was 
considered a rare disease with mild symptoms (31); only 14 human cases were reported and no 
outbreaks were detected during that period (32).
4.1.[ADDRESS_208984] large outbreak of ZIKV disease was reported in Yap Island (Federal state of Micronesia) 
in 2007 (33), and was followed by [CONTACT_177912] 2013 -2014 (34). The first 
cases of ZIKV disease in South America were reported in Easter Island in 2014 (35), and the first 
reports of locally transmitted infection (ie, by [CONTACT_930]) came from Brazil in May 2015 (36), 
which triggered the third outbreak in2015 -2016. Since then, ZIKV disease has continued 
spreading through the South American continent and to other regions. In the current outbreak that 
started in 2015, there have been estimates of more than 750,000 ZIKV -suspected cases reported 
from more than 60 countries/territories; most of these cases are from the South America continent 
(37, 38).
4.1.[ADDRESS_208985] spread globally (39). Other potential vectors 
for ZIKV include other Aedes species (including Ae.furcifer ,Ae.vittatus ,Ae.dalzieli ,
Ae.metallicus ,Ae.hirsutus ,Ae.unilinaetus ,Ae.africanus ,Ae.taylori ,Ae.hensilli , and 
Ae.luteocephalus ) along with mosquitoes from other genera (such as Anopheles , Mansonia , and 
Culex ) (40), the true extent of the vectors being still unknown. Nonhuman and human primates are 
likely the main reservoirs of the ZIKV as for most arthropod -borne viruses (arboviruses) (41), and

anthroponotic (human -to-vector -to-human) transmission is most likely responsible for the rapid 
spreading of the virus during outbreaks.
Vertical transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy (6, 42-44)and the perinatal period 
(45, 46), sexual contact (47-49), and blood transfusion (50, 51)are also confirmed modes of 
transmission of the disease. Potentially, the virus could be transmitted through laboratory exposure 
and by [CONTACT_177913] (52, 53),eg, tears, urine (54-56), breast milk ,or through solid organ 
transplants (57, 58), but there is limited evidence to support this (59-61).
4.1.4 ZIKV Infection: Detection, Disease, Complications and Treatment
Detection
Testing for ZIKV infection is complicated by [CONTACT_177954] a definitive laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV infection. Viral RNA is the first analyte that 
can be de tected in an infected person in multiple specimen types. In blood, as the immune response 
develops (immunoglobulin M [IgM] titers rise), levels of viral RNA decline. However, viral RNA 
may be detectable in some infected persons for longer periods in certai n specimen types (62, 63).
Whole blood, serum and urine are the primary diagnostic specimens for ZIKV infection. Other 
specimen types such as plasma, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], and amniotic fluid are authorized for use with 
some tests that have received a Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) Emergency Use 
Authorization (64). Other specimens that still need validation but might be appropriate for 
evaluating ZIKV disease include saliva (65, 66), semen, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 
amniotic fluid (43), and t issue samples of, for instance , fetal brain and placenta biopsies (6, 42, 
67).
Testing methods used for ZIKV infection include molecular and serologic testing: reverse 
transcript ion-polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) for viral nucleic acid, and IgM -antibody 
capture enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (MAC -ELISA), as well as focus reduction 
neutralizing test (FRNT), plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), micro -neutralization (M N) 
assay, and reporter virus particle (RVP) assay for anti -ZIKV antibodies. Although PRNT typi[INVESTIGATOR_177821], serological assays are subject to cross -reactivity, especially in subjects 
with prior flavivirus infection or immunization histor y. In contrast, diagnosis by [CONTACT_937] -PCR has been 
most successful within 1 week after the onset of clinical illness, though viremia is generally low 
level, which makes viral isolation from clinical samples difficult (68). Data from studies in 
non-human primates (NHP) evaluated for neutralizing antibodies by [CONTACT_177955], MN 
assay and RVP assay suggest that although both FRNT and MN assay strongly correlated with 
EC 50RVP values, RVP assay was more sensitive (69).
Disease
More than 80% of ZIKV infections remain asymptomatic (33), and for the symptomatic cases, the 
disease is in general mild and of short duratio n. Some clinical manifestations include, but are not 
limited to, mild fever, maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia (70).

The incubation period between infecti on andsymptoms appears to be of 3 to 11 days (3, 4), which 
is similar to that of other mosquito -borne flaviviru s diseases. The course of infection is mostly 
self-limiting. However, pre -existing cross -reactive antibodies directed against other ﬂaviviruses 
may exacerbate secondary ZIKV infection through antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE). A 
recent publication has d emonstrated that human dengue virus antibodies enhance in vitro infection 
with ZIKV, suggesting that ADE is not merely a theoretical concern (71). 
Congenital Zika Syndrome
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_177762], ZIKV infection during pregnancy has 
been associated with serious outcomes for the fetus and newborn. The severity of the disease is 
related to the consequences in the fetus and newborn child from women with ZIKV infection 
during pregnancy (42, 72). The spectrum of congenital anomalies associated with ZIKV infection, 
known as Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) , consists of severe microcephaly (5-8)with partially 
collapsed skull, cerebral cortices with subcortical calcifications, macular scarring and focal 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_177763], congenital contractures, and marked early hypertonia with symptoms 
of extrapyramidal involvement (9).
The exposure to ZIKV at any moment during pregnancy is a risk for fetal or postnatal 
developmental complications , primarily affecting brain developme nt. Recent analysis of the U.S. 
Zika Pregnancy Registry (USZPR) showed that the prevalence of newborn swith congenital 
defects from pregnancies with laboratory -confirmed ZIKV infection is 10% (95% CI: 7% -14%). 
This is 30 times higher than baseline prevalen ce before more recent Zika outbreaks (10).
Since the beginning of these outbreaks and up to end of September 2017, there have been 
3689confirmed C ZSmalformations potentially associated with ZIKV infection in 27 countries 
and territories of Latin America and the Caribbean .
Guillain -Barré Syndrome
ZIKV is a neurotropic flavivirus that can potentially cause disease within the central nervous 
system. Worldwide concern over ZIKV causing Guillain -Barré Syndrome ( GBS )emerged when 
an increased number of GBS cases was temporally associated with the [ADDRESS_208987] ZIKV, compared to 56% in the control group (p<0.0001 )(11-13). Other 
neurological complications, such as encephalitis, meningoencephalitis (14), paresthesia, facial 
paralysis and myelitis (15, 16),have also been associated with ZIKV infection. Based on th ese 
findings, the countries affected by [CONTACT_177916] [ADDRESS_208988] increased 2 to 9.8 times co mpared to baseline before the epi[INVESTIGATOR_177822] (19),and up to 20 times in French Polynesia (12). The association of GBS was only 
reported when the circulating strain was of Asian lineage (21). As of 01 February 2017, ZIKV of 
the Asian lineage was circulating in more than 80% of affected countries, including 48 countries in

Latin America (22). The overall incidence of ZIKV -associated GBS is estimated to be 24 per 
100,000 cases of ZIKV infec tion (23).
Treatment
No specific antiviral treatment is available for ZIKV infections and no vaccine against ZIKV is 
currently available (73). As the disease is self -limiting, treatment for uncomplicated ZIKV 
infection is supportive and focuses on symptoms. Treatment for more severe forms of ZIKV 
infection should address specific medical issues, and in the case of congenital ZIKV infection, 
neurodevelopmental issues for the infant’s particular needs (74).
Patient care includes proper hydration, monitoring for possible coagulopathy and multiple organ 
failure. Intensive care is recommended for the patients depi[INVESTIGATOR_177823], such as 
showing signs of coagulopathy, tachycardia, hypotension and renal dysfunction. Patients with 
neurological complications such as GBS require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (75). Non -steroidal 
anti-inﬂammatory drugs and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_177824]. Such medications 
should be avoided i n case of concomitant infection with dengue fever virus. In case of suspected 
ZIKV infection in pregnant women, sonography is recommended to monitor the proper fetal 
growth and potential complications of infant microcephaly (76).
The main recommendations to address outbreaks are through prevention (avoiding mosq uito bites, 
reducing sexual transmission, improving the procedures for safe blood transfusion), and vector 
control measures (77, 78). 
4.2 Rational e for the Proposed Trial 
4.2.1 Medical Need
ZIKV has posed a challenging situation for health, public and economic sectors of affected 
countries. The increase in microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil 
following a similar cluster in the French Polynesia in 2014 (24), prompted the World Health 
Organization (WHO) to declare Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
(PHEIC) on 01 February 2016 (25)and recommended to focus research on the causal association 
of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and microcephaly and other neurol ogical abnormalities in 
newborns. WHO recommended to standardize and enhance the surveillance for microcephaly and 
GBS particularly in areas of known or high risk of ZIKV transmission and to intensify the research 
into the etiology of new clusters of micro cephaly and other neurological disorders to determine 
whether there is a causative link to ZIKV and/or other factors or co -factors.
Considering the rapid spread of ZIKV and the significant threat to public health especially to 
pregnant women and their chil dren’s health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
declared Zika a public health emergency in Puerto Rico in August 2016 (79).In November 2016, 
after evaluating the evidence about the causal association of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and
microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities in newborns, WHO announced that Zika no 
longer represents a PHEIC (80)but stressed the need to escalate the disease to a sustained work 
program with dedicated resources to address its long -term nature and its associated consequences.

Purified Inactivated Zika Virus Vaccine (PI [INVESTIGATOR_177760])
Trial No. ZIK -101 Page 37of 108
Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
The risk of infection with ZIKV is increasing given that the spread of ZIKV is rapid and intense in 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_177825]. Vector control is difficult to establish and maintain, and new 
areas continue to be colonized by [CONTACT_177917]. Clim ate changes may also create favorable 
environments to maintain the vector (81). There is an increased urban population and mobility, and 
the role of sex ual transmission may be an important mechanism to spread rapi[INVESTIGATOR_177826], even in regions where the vector is uncommon.
Considering the conclusive associations between ZIKV infections and fetal and postnatal 
abnormalities, as well as strong associations with other medically important complications such as 
GBS, the development of a vaccine that can provide protection is crucial for countries where the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_177768]/or persist, as well as in countries in whi ch the virus has not yet 
been introduced. In order to address the urgent medical need and in anticipation of possible 
additional outbreaks with rapid onsets, [COMPANY_005] has initiated the development of a purified 
inactivated ZIKV vaccine candidate, PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760], for u se in endemic areas and non -endemic areas for 
prevention of ZIKV associated illness of any severity and/or infection.

The rationale for the observer -blind app roach is based on the different physical appearance of the 
investigational vaccine compared to the saline solution placebo that was selected and preferred to 
alum -containing placebo to avoid side effects associated with alum. The rationale for the use of 
placebo in this trial is based on the absence of effective treatment or prevention for ZIKV disease.
Due to the need to vaccinate women and men of reproductive age, the primary target population of 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_177770] 9 years of age and older. In this phase 1 stud y, study population is limited to ≥18 to 
≤49years, and age expansion will be included in the next phase of development.
To ensure the enrollment of healthy adults, screening tests (hematology, biochemistry and 
urinalysis) will be performed prior to vaccin e administration.
Flavivirus primed adults are included in this study to assess if there is any impact from pre -existing 
flavivirus antibodies. The testing of flaviviral serological status will be performed prior to 
randomization and will enable stratifica tion of randomization.
Due to the ongoing threat of ZIKV disease and the urgent need of a vaccine, ZIK -101 will be 
accelerated to assess dose finding for PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760], in addition to evaluation of safety and 
immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate (PI[INVESTIGATOR_177760]) in both f lavivirus seronegative (naïve) and 
seropositive (primed) subjects. 
The reactogenicity/safety of PI[INVESTIGATOR_177831]. Flavivirus naïve subjects will be enrolled during 
the first phase of the study. In the absence of clinical data on ZIKV vaccine, it is propose d to 
recruit flavivirus primed subjects in a second stage. If positive recommendations from an external
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) are issued following the review of safety and tolerability data 
in the flavivirus naïve population, when the last flaviv irus naïve subject has completed study 
Visit 4 ([ADDRESS_208993] dose 1), vaccination of flavivirus primed subjects will start.
The primary rationale for selection of the three vaccine dose levels can be summarized as follows: 
the low -dose level (2 µg) was selected for purposes of potentially identify an immunological 
threshold, and based on the limit of the analytical methods for the drug product available at the 
time;
the mid -dose level (5 µg) was selected to provide a mid -point on the dose response curve. In 
addition, this dose level is based on the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) 
vaccine currently tested in Phase 1 (84), which was originally based on initial studies in NHPs 
(85); and
the high -dose level (10 µg) was selected to follow a n approximate 2 -fold range and to further 
define the potential dose -response curve in both naïve and primed subjects.

6.0 TRIAL DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION
6.1 Trial Design
This is a phase 1, randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled, safety, immunogenicity, and 
dose ranging study of PI[INVESTIGATOR_177780]ïve and primed healthy adults aged ≥18 to 
≤49years , in ZIKV endemic and non -endemic regions.
The trial willlast approximately [ADDRESS_209011] for up to 2 weeks (14 days) prior to randomization, 
with the possibility that some subjects (Flavivirus primed subjects only) will need to repeat some 
screening procedures if they were not randomized right after the screening period (further 
clarification is provided in the schedule of trial procedures).
Flavivirus naïve subjects: subjects without detectable serum antibodies aga inst a panel of 
flaviviruses as measured by a reactive antibody -based assay (Luminex) (refer to the Serology 
Plan, available on file).
Flavivirus primed subjects: subjects with serum antibodies against a panel of flaviviruses as 
measured by a reactive antibody -based assay (Luminex) (refer to the Serology Plan, available 
on file). 
Approximately 240 subjects aged ≥18 to ≤49 years will be enrolled and equally randomized into 
four groups (arms) (1:1:1:1) of approximately 60 subjects, each comprised of appr oximately 
30flavivirus naïve subjects and approximately 30 flavivirus primed subjects. Randomization

Staggered enrollment ( Figure 6.b): There will be two study phases. 
The first phase of the study will be aimed at enrolling flavivirus naïve subjects only. All 
subjects who sign the informed consent form (ICF) and have confirmed eligibility at Screening 
Visit 1A will be tested for flavivirus serostatus.
Eligible flavivirus naïve subjects enrolled at Screening Visit 1A will be randomized at Visit 2, 
within two weeks after Scr eening Visit 1A.
Flavivirus primed subjects will not be enrolled during the first phase of the study (ie, when 
identified at Screening Visit 1A) and will be invited to come back for the second phase of the 
study. They will be contact[CONTACT_177957]ïve subjects, when the

primed subjects will c onsequently undergo 2 screening visits: Visit 1A during the first phase of 
the study, and Visit 1B at the outset of the second phase of the study. Therefore, it is 
recommended that the key aspects of the ICF already si gned during the Screening Visit 1A are
reinforced with the subject. Flavivirus primed subjects identified at Screening Visit 1A who do 
not participate in the second phase of the study will be declared screened failure (see 
Figure 6.b§).
Enrollment will be put on hold after all naïve subjects have been enrolled and will resume 
when positive recommendations from the external DMC are issued, as described above.

Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
6.2 Justification for Trial Design, Dose, and Endpoints
The trial design and the collection of solicited and unsolicited AEs following vaccination are 
consiste nt with guidelines on vaccine evaluation trials, including dose -finding studies.
The design of the study answers to the principles outlined in the ICH Considerations on Clinical 
Trials E8 (86)and the WHO Guidelines for Evaluation of Vaccines (87), and more specifically for 
phase 1 trials. As such, the study design, objectives and endpoints were defined so as to assess the 
initial safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine candidate, obtain preliminary information on its 
immunogenicity, and provide data useful for the design of further clinical studies. The 
dose-ranging design adopted is in line with the ICH and FDA guidance (88, 89).The use of 
placebo as control for the investigational vaccine is justified in the absence of a proven 
intervention (90), ie, as no prophylactic vaccine agai nst ZIKV infection is available to date. 
As this is a first in human trial, a relatively high serum volume (60 mL) will be needed for assay 
development and other pre -clinical studies to support possible alternative license pathways which 
may include bridging animal data to human data.
The rationale for the proposed trial is given in Section 4.2.[ADDRESS_209028] ’s Expected Participation in the Entire Trial
Each enrolled subject’s participation in the trial will last approximately 7 or 25months, following 
a screening period prior to Visit 2 of two -weeks for flavivirus naïve subjects and of more than two 
weeks for flavivirus primed subjects.
6.4 Premature Termination or Suspension of Trial or Investigational Site
6.4.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Trial
The trial will be completed as planned unless one or more of the following criteria are satisfied that 
require temporary suspension or early termination of the trial.
New information or other evaluation regarding the safety or efficacy of the investigational 
vaccine that indicates a change in the known risk/benefit profile, such that the risk /benefit is no 
longer acceptable for subjects participating in the trial.
The external DMC recommends that the trial should be suspended or terminated.
Significant deviation from Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to 
achieve the prim ary trial objectives or compromises subject safety.
6.4.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Investigational Sites
A trial site may be terminated prematurely or suspended if the site (including the investigator) is 
found in significant deviation from GCP, protocol, or contractual agreement, is unable to ensure 
adequate performance of the trial, or as otherwise permitted by [CONTACT_82280].

Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
7.3 Criteria for Delay of Vaccination and/or Blood Sampling
After enrollment , subjects may encounter clinical circumstances that warrant a delay in the 
administration of the subsequent dose of investigational vaccine/placebo. These situations are 
listed below:
Individuals with a clinically significant active infection (as assessed by [CONTACT_093]) or 
temperature ≥38.0°C /100.4°F ,within 3 days of intended investigational vaccine/placebo 
administration.
Individuals who received any other vacc ines within [ADDRESS_209041] is otherwise eligible for 
trial partic ipation. The decision to vaccinate in those situations will be taken by [CONTACT_093] .
There are also circumstances under which receipt of further vaccines is a contraindication in this 
trial. These circumstances include anaphylaxis or severe hypersensi tivity reactions following the 
initial vaccine/placebo administration. If these reactions occur, the subject must not receive 
additional vaccinations; however, the subject is encouraged to continue in trial participation for 
safety reasons.
7.[ADDRESS_209042]’s trial participation may be terminated early. This means that 
no further trial procedures (including data collection) will be performed on that subject beyond the 
specific date of earl y termination. The primary reason for early termination of the subject from the 
trial should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF “end of study visit” page) using 
the following categories. For screen failure subjects, refer to Section 9.1.10 .
1.Adverse Event: The subject has experienced an AE (irrespective of being related / unrelated to 
the Trial Vaccine or trial -related procedures ) that requires early termination because continued 
participation imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health and / or the subject is 
unwilling to continue participation because of the AE. If the subject is unwilling to continue 
because of the AE the primary reason for early termination in this case will be ‘withdrawal due 
to AE’ and not ‘withdrawal of consent’, see below. Any ongoing AEs leading to early 
termination will be followed by [CONTACT_177971].
2.Lost to follow -up: The subject did not return to the clinic and at least three attempts to contact 
[CONTACT_57509]. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_45316].
3.Withdrawal of consent: The subject wishes to withdraw from the trial. The primary reason for 
early termination will be ‘withdrawal of consent” if the subject withdraws from participation 
due to a non -medical reason (ie, reason other than AE). The reason for withdrawal, if provided, 
should be recorded in the eCRF.

8.2 Investigational Vaccine/Placebo Assignment and Dispensing Procedures
The investigator or investigator’s designee will access the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) 
at Screening Visit (1A or 1B) to obtain the subject IDnumber. 
The investigator or investigator’s designee will utilize the IRT to randomize the subject at Visit 2. 
The investigational vaccine/placebo identification numbers to be administered will be assigned by 
[CONTACT_6606]. Details of randomization and the IRT will be covere d in the IRT User Manual.
The investigational vaccine/placebo will be prepared and administered by [CONTACT_177981], according to the instructions in the Pharmacy Manual. All investigational vaccine/placebo 
preparation will be documented.
All doses of the investigational vaccine/placebo will be administered IM into the middle third of 
the deltoid muscle of the subject’s arm, preferably the non -domin ant arm.
The investigator or designee will be responsible for overseeing the administration of 
investigational vaccine/placebo to subjects enrolled in the trial according to the procedures 
stipulated in this trial protocol.
If vials containing the investig ational vaccine/placebo are lost or damaged, the site can request a 
replacement from the IRT (refer to the IRT manual supplied separately). Expi[INVESTIGATOR_177852].
PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN ADMINISTERING THE TRIAL VACCINE:
Prior to vaccination, a subject must be determined to be eligible for trial vaccination and it must be 
clinically appropriate in the judgment of the investigator to vaccinate. Eligibility for vaccination 
prior to first trial vaccine administration is determine d by [CONTACT_177982] (Sections 7.1and 7.2).
Eligibility for subsequent trial vaccination is determined by [CONTACT_29274] 7.0.

injection intramuscularly. In addition, WHO recommendations to reduce anxiety and pain at the 
time of vaccination should be followed (91). Before administering the vaccine, the vaccination site 
is to be disinfected with a skin disinfectant (eg, 70% alcohol). Allow the skin to dry. DO NOT 
inject intravascularly.
As with all injectable vaccines, trained medical personnel and appropriate medical treatment 
should be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions fo llowing vaccination. For example, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:1000, diphenhydramine, and/or other medications for treating anaphylaxis should 
be available.
8.3 Randomization Code Creation and Storage
Randomization personnel of the IRT provider or designee will generate the randomization 
schedule(s). Randomization information will be stored in a secured area, accessible only by 
[CONTACT_4144].
8.[ADDRESS_209044] Blind Maintenance
This trial is an observer -blind study. The subjects, data collectors (eg, investigator ), and data 
evaluators (eg, trial statisticians) are blinded to the material administered. The investigational 
product assignment will be maintained by [CONTACT_177987].
All care must be taken to ensure that the unblinded reports and docum ents are shared only with 
unblinded personnel and properly stored in a secured area, accessible only by [CONTACT_85983].
8.5 Unblinding Procedure

unblinding.
For unblinding a subject, the investigational vaccine/placebo blind can be obtained by [CONTACT_1275], by [CONTACT_177990].
The sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department must be notified as soon as possible if the 
investigational vac cine/placebo blind is broken by [CONTACT_093]; and if the unblinding was for 
medical reasons (SAE), the completed SAE form must be sent within 24 hours (ie, the site will 
follow the standard process for reporting of SAEs). The date, time, and reason the blind is broken 
must be recorded in the source document and the same information (except the time) must be 
recorded on the eCRF.
If any subject is unblinded, no further doses of investigational vaccine/placebo are to be 
administered. However, the subject will be followed up for safety and safety data will be collected 
according to protocol.

8.6 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor -Supplied Vaccine/Placebo
Investigational vaccine/placebo supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being 
returned to the sponsor or designee as noted below. Sites will maintain source documents in 
addition to entering data in the IRT.
The investigator or designee must ensure that the sponsor -supplied vaccine/placebo is used in 
accordance with the approved protoc ol and is administered only to subjects enrolled in the trial. To 
document appropriate use of sponsor -supplied vaccines/placebos, the investigator must maintain 
records of all sponsor -supplied vaccine/placebo delivery to the site, site inventory, administr ation 
and use by [CONTACT_6992], and return to the sponsor or designee.
Upon receipt of sponsor -supplied vaccines/placebos, the investigator or designee must verify the 
contents of the shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the q uantity is 
correct, the investigational vaccine/placebo is received within the labeled storage conditions (ie, 
no cold chain break has occurred during transit), and is in good condition. If quantity and 
conditions are acceptable, investigator or designee w ill acknowledge receipt of the shipment by 
[CONTACT_117540].
If there are any discrepancies between the packing list versus the actual product received, the 
sponsor or designee must be contact[CONTACT_45320]. The packing list should be filed in the
investigator’s essential document file.
The investigator must maintain 100% accountability for all sponsor -supplied vaccines/placebos 
received and administered during his or her entire participation in the trial. Proper vaccine/placebo 
accountability incl udes, but is not limited to:
Verifying that actual inventory matches documented inventory;
Verifying that the log is completed for the vaccine/placebo used to prepare each dose;
Verifying that all containers used are documented accurately on the log;
Verif ying that required fields are completed accurately and legibly.
If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately.
The investigator must record the current inventory of all sponsor -supplied vaccines/placebos on a 
sponsor -approved vaccine/placebo accountability log. The following information will be recorded 
at a minimum: protocol number and title, name [CONTACT_4236], site identifier and number, 
description of sponsor -supplied vaccines/placebos, date and amo unt. The log should include all 
required information as a separate entry for each subject to whom sponsor -supplied 
vaccine/placebo is administered.
The investigator will be notified of any expi[INVESTIGATOR_177855]. On expi[INVESTIGATOR_4058], the site must 
complete all instructions outlined in the notification, including segregation of expi[INVESTIGATOR_177856].

the trial and before any protocol -directed procedures are performed.
A unique subject ID number will be assigned at Screening Visit (1A or 1B) to each subject after 
informed consent is obtained from the appropriate coding eg, IRT. If all eligibility criteria are 
fulfilled, this subject ID number will be used throughout the trial. Subject ID numbers assigned to 
subjects who fail screening should not be reused (Section 9.1.10 ).
Flavivirus primed subjects who were tested at Screening Visit 1A and accepted to enter th e second 
phase of the study (at Screening Visit 1B) do not need to sign the ICF again. Refer to Section 6.1

subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be 
re-measured. Repeated vital signs may be used to determine eligibility. 
9.1.6 Blood Sample and Urine Sample Collection
Blood samples will be collected at each site visit: ie, at Screening Visit(s) (Visit 1A and/or Visit 
1B) for flavivirus serostatus determin ation (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and eligibility screening tests 
(including pregnancy testing) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), at Visits 3 and 5 for routine safety laboratory 
testing (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), and at Visits 2, 4, 6, 8, and ( for subjects who will be randomized to 
the placebo group or the PI[INVESTIGATOR_177789] ) 9 and 
11for immunogenicity ,as well as for further development and characterization of ass ays (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Should a blood sampling be performed during a vaccination visit, this sampling 
must occur before the administration of the investigational vaccine or placebo. The maximum 
volume of blood taken at any single visit will be between approximately [ADDRESS_209048]’s flavivirus serostatus at screening and the vaccine dose level the subject 
received. Blood should be taken from the subject using an aseptic venipuncture technique. Blood 
samples will be sent to the central laboratory.

9.1.7 Safety Assessments
During the trial, s afety assessments will include collection and recording of solicited local 
(injection site) and systemic AEs (including fever), unsolicited AEs (serious and non -serious) , and 
new medical conditions (neurological and neuroinflammatory disorders) with onset after the first 
vaccination . Refer to Section 10.[ADDRESS_209054] to use an "acceptable 
contraceptive method" from trial entry through [ADDRESS_209055] dose of trial vaccine, and 
will be advised not to donate ova during this period.
Furthermore, to avoid sexual transmission of ZIKV from natural exposure, all enrolled sexually 
active subjects (both male and female) will have to use latex condoms co rrectly and consistently 
even if other contraceptive measures are used from signing the ICF through the end of the trial.
Male subjects must be advised not to donate sperm during this period.
Refer to Section 7.2for more details.
9.1.9 Pregnancy
In women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening 
Visit(s) (Visit 1A and/or Visit 1B) , and a urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Vi sit2 
(Day 1) before randomization (and thereby [CONTACT_178002]/placebo dose 1 
administration) for confirmation of eligibility, as well as at Visit 4 (Day 29) before investigational 
vaccine/placebo dose 2 administration. 
Serum pregnancy tests will be conducted in the central laboratory (and will be part of the eligibility 
screening tests) and u rine pregnancy tests will be performed at the study site using kits provided by 
[CONTACT_456] . 
Subjects must have a negative serum-hCG pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine 
-hCG pregnancy test prior to receiving any dose of investigational vaccine/placebo.
To ensure subject safety and the safety of the unborn child, each pregnancy in a subject having 
received a ninvestigational vaccine/placebo must be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_209056] becomes pregnant during the trial, she will not receive 
any further doses of any sponsor -supplied investigational vaccin e/placebo. The pregnancy must be 
followed to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, 
and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications. This fol low-up should occur even if the intended duration of safety 
follow -up for the trial has ended.

Any pregnancy occurring following investigational vaccine/placebo administration should be 
reported immediately, using a pregnancy notification form, to the cont act listed in the Investigator 
Site File.
Should the pregnancy occur after administration of a blinded investigational vaccine/placebo, the 
investigator must inform the subject of their right to receive information on the study 
vaccine/placebo administered . If the subject chooses to receive unblinded information, the 
individual blind should be broken by [CONTACT_178005], as 
described in Section 8.5.

A subject may be a temporary screen failure under the following circumstances: due to temporary 
conditions such as receipt of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], blood prod ucts, 
immunoglobulins, or vaccines, in the respective prohibited periods (see exclusion criteria 7, 13 or 
14), or in the event that a subject has an indeterminate pregnancy test result or has not used 
acceptable contraceptive methods in the period defined in the protocol, prior to the start of the 
study (exclusion criteria 19). Subjects screen failed for the above -mentioned reasons may be 
rescreened once they cease to meet the respective exclusion criteria. Should the respective 
repeated test results be ava ilable within the initial screening period, no new subject ID numbers 
will be required; the repeated screening tests will be recorded in the appropriate CRF (unscheduled 
lab form). Should the respective repeated test results not be available within the ini tial screening 
period, the subject would need to be screen failed and all screening procedures and tests would 
need to be repeated with a new subject ID number.
Subject ID numbers assigned to subjects who fail screening should not be reused.

oStarting on the day of vaccine/placebo administration, the subject will check for 
specific types of events at the injection site (solicited local AEs), any specific 
generalized symptoms (solicited systemic AEs), body temperature (preferably oral), 
any other symptoms or change in the subject’s health status, and any medications taken 
(excluding vitamins and minerals). These solicited AEs and body temperature will be 
recorded in the diary. Assessments should preferably take place in the evening at day’s 
end using the same route of measurement every day.
oTemperature measurement is to be performed using the thermometer provided by [CONTACT_39722]. If the subject feels u nusually hot or cold during the day, the subject should check 
his/her temperature. The highest body temperature observed that day should be 
recorded on the diary card.
oThe measurement of solicited local AEs (erythema, swelling, and induration) is to be 
performed using the ruler provided by [CONTACT_779]. If multiple measurements are taken 
during the day, the highest measured value should be recorded on the diary card.
oThe collection on the diary card of body temperature, solicited local AEs, and solicited 
system ic AEs will continue for a total of 7 days following each vaccine/placebo 
administration. The collection on the diary card of unsolicited AEs and medications

Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a trial vaccine; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with trial 
vaccine administration.
An AE can the refore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the administration of a trial 
vaccine whether or not it is considered related to the trial vaccine.
AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_178029]:
Mild Grade 1Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. Relieved with or without symptomatic treatment.
Moderate Grade 2Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity. Only partially relieved with symptomatic treatment.
Severe Grade 3Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or 
incapacitation. Prevents normal everyday activities. Not relieved with 
symptomatic treatment
10.1.2 Solicited Adverse Events
The occurrence of selected indicators of safety ( Table 10.a) will be measured/collected for 7 days 
after each dose (including the days of vaccine administration) and will be recorded on the “Local 
and Systemic AEs” eCRF as applicable. These will be su mmarized in the final report under the 
category “solicited adverse events” to differentiate them from other AEs which were not solicited. 
Any solicited local or systemic AE observed as continuing beyond 7 days after vaccination will be 
recorded as an unsol icited AE on the Adverse Event eCRF. Any solicited local (injection site) or 
systemic AE observed as continuing beyond 7 days following each trial vaccination will be 
additionally recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF for follow -up. For these persistent/prolo nged 
solicited AEs, the end date will be captured on the Adverse Event eCRF to permit a separate 
analysis from the unsolicited AEs.

Protocol Amendment 3 Version 7.0 12September 2018
10.1.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:
1.Results in DEATH.
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.
3.Requires inpatient HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_177871].
4.Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.
5.Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT in the offspring of a subject.
6.Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the following:
May require intervention to prevent items 1 through 5 above.
May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
10.2 Causality of AEs
Relatedness (causality) to vaccine will also be as sessed by [CONTACT_093]. The relationship of 
each AE, including solicited systemic AEs (solicited local AEs are considered as related) to trial 
vaccine(s) will be assessed using the following categories:
Related: There is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_177872] a relat ionship between the trial vaccine and the 
AE (without determining the extent of probability); there is a reasonable 
possibility that the trial vaccine contributed to the AE.
Not Related: There is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_177872] a relationship between the trial vaccine and the 
AE; there are other more likely causes and administration of the trial vaccine is not suspected to have contributed to the AE.
10.2.1 Relationship to Trial Procedures
Relationship (causality) to trial procedures should be determined for all AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as “Yes” if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibility that an event is due to a trial procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as “No”.

Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -existing condition. Intermittent 
events for pre -existing conditions or underlying disease should not be considered as AEs.
Necessitate therapeutic intervention.
Require an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requir e vaccine discontinuation or a change in concomitant medication.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_109307].
Diagnoses vssigns and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal laboratory values) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a 
diagnosis is unknown, signs or symptoms should be recorded appropriately as AEs.
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after sta rting administration of 
the trial vaccine, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsenin g or complication of an AE after any change in trial 
vaccine, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should

Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severity of an AE, the event should be captured once with 
the maximum severity recorded.
Preplanned surgeries or procedures:
Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
informed consent are not considered AEs. Complications resulting from any planned surgery 
should be reported as AEs.
Elective surgeries or procedures:
Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condition 
should not be recorded as AEs; however, these procedures should be documented in the 
subject’s source documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be 
reported as AEs.
Medical occurrences emerging during the time between signing of informed conse nt and the first 
administration of investigational vaccine /placebo will be recorded onthe medical history eCRF 
page. However ,if such medical occurrence is assessed as ’related to a study procedure ’this should 
be re ported as an AE‘related to study procedure ’in the eCRF.
10.4 Procedures
10.4.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs
All AEs, whether considered related with the use of the investigational vaccine/placebo or not, 
must be monitored until symptoms subside and any abnormal laboratory values have returned to 
baseline, or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until death, in 
which case a full pathologist’s report should be supplied, if possible. All findings must be reported 
on an AE eCRF and on the SAE form, if necessary (see S ection 10.4.2 ). All findings in subjects 
experiencing AEs must also be reported in the subject’s source documents. Any unsolicited AEs 
will be coll ected for 28 days after each vaccine/placebo administration (ie, through trial Day 28 
and trial Day 56) via diary cards. AEs leading to withdrawal or discontinuation will be collected 
throughout the trial.
The following information will be documented for e ach event:
Reported term for the Adverse Event,
Start and end date,
Serious (Y/N),
Severity,
Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_177873] (relationship) between the event and administration of

The occurrence of selected i ndicators of safety will be collected on diary cards by [CONTACT_178030] 
7days following each investigational vaccine/placebo administration (ie, the day of vaccination 
+6subsequent days) and will be recorded on the “Local and Systemic AE” eCRF, as appli cable. 
These will be summarized in the final report under the category “solicited adverse events” to 
differentiate them from unsolicited AEs. Any solicited local (injection site) or systemic AE 
observed as continuing beyond 7 days following each trial vacc ination will be additionally 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF for follow -up. For these persistent/prolonged solicited AEs, 
the end date will be captured on the Adverse Event eCRF to permit a separate analysis from the 
unsolicited AEs. 
Any solicited AE t hat meets any of the following criteria must be entered as an AE on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.
Solicited local or systemic AEs that lead the subject to withdraw from the trial.
Solicited local or systemic AEs that lead to the subject being withdrawn from the trial or to

13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stat istical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to unblinding of subject’s 
treatment assignment. This document will provide further details regarding the definition of 
analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all trial object ives.
A blinded data review will be conducted prior to unblinding of subject’s vaccination assignment. 
This review will assess the accuracy and completeness of the trial database, subject evaluability, 
and appropriateness of the planned statistical methods .
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
Safety Set : The Safety Set will consist of all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose of the investigational vaccine/placebo .
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS will include all randomized subjects who have received at 
least one dose of the investigational vaccine/placebo and provided valid baseline and at least 
one post -vaccination serology result . Subjects will be included in the FAS analysis ‘as 
randomized ’.
Per–Protocol Set (PPS): The PPS will include all subjects in the FAS who have no major 
protocol violations. The major protocol violation criteria will be defined as part of the blinded 
data review prior to the unblinding of subject’s investigational vaccine/placebo assignment. 
The categories of major protocol violations inc lude: 
a)not meeting selected entry criteria, 
b)receiving a wrong investigational vaccine/placebo, 
c)receiving prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
d)other major protocol violations that may be identified during blinded data reviews.
All summaries and analyses of safety d ata will be based on subjects in the Safety Set. 
The primary immunogenicity analyses will be based on the PPS, and additional immunogenicity 
analyses will be based on the FAS.

administration) via daily collection of solicited AEs, includin g local reactions (injection site: pain, 
erythema, swelling, and induration) and systemic AEs of headache, fatigue, malaise, arthralgia and 
myalgia. In addition, body temperature (preferably measured as oral temperature) as indicator of 
reactogenicity will be collected (with fever defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C/100.4°F).
For each solicited AE and fever, the percentage of subjects will be summarized by [CONTACT_178044] 7 days after each vaccine/placebo administration and overall. For subjects with 
more than 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_177882], the maximum severity will be used for tabulations.
Unsolicited AEs and SAEs will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by [CONTACT_178045] (neurological and neuroinflammatory 
disorders) with onset after the first vaccination.
In general, unsolicited AEs will be tabulated at each of the following levels: overall summary 
(subject with at least 1 AE), and by [CONTACT_3592]. Unsolicited AEs will be summarized as follows: 
by [CONTACT_6214]; by [CONTACT_3592]; by [CONTACT_2946], PT, and severity; by [CONTACT_2946], PT, and relationship (causality) to the

Appendix EFDA Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials 
Toxicity grading scales for laboratory abnormalities should consider the local laboratory reference 
values when the parameter limit values are defined. The characterization of laboratory parameters 
among some populations of healthy adults and adolescents may require the exercise of clinical 
judgment. Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug

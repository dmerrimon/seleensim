Status: Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_481761] recent amendment.
Amendment 2 (26April 2018)
The overall reason for the amendment: To add results of the male and female rat fertility studies. To exclude 
enrollment of women of childbearing potential (W OCBP). In addition, other minor changes and clarifications 
related to study procedures were made.
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: To u pdate nonclinical data 
Section 1.1.1 Nonclinical 
Studies (Toxicology); 
Section 16.1 . Stud y-Specific 
Design Considerations; 
References (68-72)Added results from the male and female rat fertility studies and relevant literature 
references.
Rationale: Thefemale rat fertility study suggested that JNJ -42847922 reduced female fertility rates at a ll doses 
studied. Since it is not known what the relevance of these findings are to a w oman’s ability to become pregnant after 
taking JNJ -42847922, WOCBP will be excluded from this study until more is learned about the effect of 
JNJ-42847922 on female repr oduction.
Synopsis (Subject 
Population); 
Section 3.2. Study Design 
Rationale; 
Section 4.1. Inclusion 
Criteria;
Section 16.1. Study -Specific 
Design ConsiderationsInclusion Criterion #1: Revised the text to indicate that the study population will 
include men and w omen “of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP)” . Added a 
definition of WONCBP.
Clarified in other relevant sections that the study population will include men and 
women “ of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP)”.
Subject 4.1. Inclusion 
CriteriaDeleted Inclusion Criteria #11 and #12. (these criteria are no longer required now  
that the female population is restricted to WONCBP. Relevant information on 
WONCBP from Inclusion Criterion #11 w as moved to Inclusion criterion #1)
Subject 4.2 . Exclusion 
CriteriaRevised Exclusion Criterion #28 as follow s:
Is pregnant ,or breastfeeding , or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in 
this study or w ithin [ADDRESS_481762] dose of study drug.
Section 1.4. Overall Risk 
and Benefit Assessment; 
Section 3. 2. Study Design 
Rationale; 
Section 16.1. Study -Specific 
Design ConsiderationsAdded text to clarify that WOCBP w ill be excluded from the study and to explain the 
rationale for excluding these subjects b ased on the nonclinical fertility findings.
Deleted t ext related to inclusion of WOCBP. 
Deleted following sentences: “It is expected that this population will be 
representative for the targeted subject population for future clinical trials.” 
and: “The study population in this protocol is intentionally broa d”

Synopsis (Safety 
Evaluations); 
Time and Events Schedule ; 
Section 9.1.1. Overview; 
Section 9.1.2. Screening; 
Section 9.7. Safety 
EvaluationsThe specific serum and urine pregnancy tests were removed from the Time and 
Events sc hedule, andthe wording was updated to clarify that pregnancy tests can be 
performed if determined necessary by [CONTACT_093]. 
Footnotes in the Time and Events Schedule were updated as follows:
Footnote h: Wom en of childbearing potential only. “Serum or urine pregnancy 
tests may be performed, as determined necessary by [CONTACT_093], to establish 
the absence of pregnancy at any time during the subject’s participation in the 
study. A FSH test may also be performed at investigator judgment to assist in 
determining if a woman is of non -childbearing potential. ”
(also added FSH to the abbreviations)
Footnote ‘i’ was deleted (and the subsequent footnote numbering updated 
accordingly)
Footnote ‘p’ was updated to indicate that menstrual tracking will be performed in
“premenopausal women”.
Rationale: The maximum age of the study population was increased from 64 years to 70 years to increase the 
patient population to help with recruitment and to learn about JNJ-42847922 in the elderly with MDD
Synopsis (Subject 
Population);

with recruitment
Synopsis (Study 
Population); 
Section 3.1. Overview of 
Study Design; 
Section 4.1. Inclusion 
Criteria ;
Section 9.1.2. ScreeningInclusion Criterion #2: Changed the required length of the current depressive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_367638] “ ≤1 year” to “≤18 months”. The corresponding change was made 
in Section 9.1.2., Screening. 
Inclusion Criterion #3: The text was updated as shown below: 
“Have had an inadequate response t o at least 1 but no more than 2 “3”
antidepressants (see the inclusion criterion below ), adm inistered at an adequate 
dose and duration in the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_17108], as assessed by [CONTACT_385190] -
ATRQ. An inadequate response is defined as <50% reduction in depressive 
symptom severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_385190] -ATRQ. An adequate trial is defined 
as an antidepressant treatment for at least [ADDRESS_481767] “or above” the 
minimum therapeutic dose, as specified in the MGH -ATRQ, for any particular 
antidepressant . The inadequate response must include the subject’s current 
antidepressant treatment.”
The corresponding change was also made in other relevant sections.
Inclusion Criterion #4: Clarified that current antidepressant treatment should be 
at “a stable dose ( at or above the minimum therapeutic dose level )”for at least 
4weeks. 
Inclusion Criterion #14: The text was updated as shown below :

response: “as indicated by [CONTACT_385191] ( ≤25% improvement in symptoms) 
when treated with an antidepressant of adequate dose (per MGH -ATRQ) and 
duration (at least 4 weeks).”    
Rationale: To clarify that concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385110]. To add additional medications to the list of p rohibited medications and timing of their 
discontinuation to add additional clarity for investigators. 
Section 8. Prestudy and 
Concomitant TherapyAdded the following text: “For subjects who fail screening, concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385111] d unless there is an adverse event.”
Added :“tricyclic antidepressants” and “bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” to the list of prohibited 
medications.
Added: “ When discontinuing a prohibited medication, the investigators should 
consider the time needed to sufficiently eliminate a drug from body system, eg, 
5half-lives of the drug.”
Rationale: Minor changes/clarifications were made to the timing and conduct of study procedures to allow  
flexibility to investigators and clarify timing of protocol procedures .
Time and Events Schedu le Revised the final table column to make it clear that the End -of-Study/Follow -up visit 
will be conducted [ADDRESS_481768] dose.

discontinued from study treatment.
Section 10.2. Withdraw al 
from the StudyThe follow ing sentence was updated as shown below  (new text indicated in 
“italics” ):
The subject shows signals of acute suicidal ideation “with a clear plan ”at any 
time during the study; the subject should be referred to appropriate 
medical/psychiatric care .
Rationale: Wording regarding the reporting process for adverse events of special interest was updated.
Section 9.7. Safety 
Evaluations (Adverse events
of Special Interest)The follow ing sentence was updated as shown below:
When reported, the investigator will be required to complete a detailed summary 
of the event and its clinical course utilizing the CRF page “AE of special interest 
narrative form” as soon as information on the outcome (recovered, resolving, or 
ongoing) is available. “In addition, the AE should be marked as an AE of special 
interest in the CRF .”  
Rationale: Wording regarding the transmission of serious adverse events to the sponsor wa s updated to remove 
reference to the Safety Report Form, as it is not relevant for this study.
Section 12.3.2. Serious 
Adverse EventsThe follow ing sentence was updated as shown below:
Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to th e sponsor 
using the Serious Adverse Event Form and Safety Report Form , which must be 
completed and reviewed “signed” by a physician from the study site, and

Status: Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_481775] Responded Inadequately to Antidepressant Therapy
JNJ-42847922 (seltorexant) is a potent and selective antagonist of the human orexin-2 receptor (OX2R, 
negative log of inhibition constant [pKi]=8) that is being developed for the treatment of major depressive 
disorder (MDD) and insomnia.
While preclinical evidence supports a role for the orexin system in modulating the HPA axis and stress -
responsiveness, clinical data in support of a role for orexin in depression are fairly limited. In depressed 
subjects, average cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) orexin levels have not been demonstrated to be different from 
controls, nor to correlate with the severity of depressive illness; however, the diurnal variation of CSF 
orexin levels has been shown to be blunted in subjects with depression, with a trend toward elevated 
orexin levels in CSF across the entire diurnal period. The most striking elevation has been noted at the 
physiologic nighttime nadir.  
 
 
 
s. The 
exploratory efficacy results from a multiple -dose study (42847922MDD1001) of 20 mg of JNJ -42847922 
in 48 subjects with MDD showed an early onset (as early as Day 11 of exposure) and a clinically relevant 
antidepressant effect that was sustain ed at least [ADDRESS_481776] on sleep -related items.
OBJECTIVE S, ENDPOINTS, AND HYPOTHESIS
Objectives Endpoints

compared to flexibly dosed quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196] (150 
mg or 300 mg) as adjunctive therapy to an 
antidepressant drug in delaying time to all-cause 
discontinuation of study drug over a 6-month
(24-week) treatment period.  Time to all-cause discontinuation of 
study drug.

OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, parallel -group, flexible -dose, 6-month 
(24-week) study in adult subjects with MDD who have an inadequate response to current antidepressant 
therapy with an SSRI/SNRI. 
The study will consist of 3 phases: an up to 4-week screening phase, a 6-month double -blind treatment 
phase, and a 2-week follow -up phase culminating in a follow -up/en d-of-study visit. Approximately 100 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either flexibly dosed JNJ -42847922 (20 or 40 mg) or 
flexibly dosed quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196] (150 or 300 mg) as adjunctive therapy to their current SSRI or SNRI.
Subjects will co ntinue to take their baseline SSRI/SNRI antidepressant (at the same dose, without change, 
every day and at approximately the same time as prior to entering the study) throughout the screening, 
double -blind, and follow -up phases.
SUBJECT POPULATION
The stud y population will include adult men and women of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP) (aged
18 to 70years, inclusive )who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5th Edition 
(DSM -5) diagnostic criteria for MDD (confirmed by [CONTACT_385197] d Clinical Interview for DSM -5 Axis I 
Disorders –Clinical Trials Version [SCID -CT]), and who have had an inadequate response to at least 
1but no more than 3antidepressants (administered at an adequate dose and duration in the current 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], as assesse d by [CONTACT_164245][INVESTIGATOR_307] -Antidepressant Treatment Response 
Questionnaire [MGH -ATRQ]). Each potential subject must have MADRS total score ≥[ADDRESS_481788] not demonstrate a clinically significant improvement (ie, an improvement of >20% on their 
MADRS total score) from the screening to baseline visit.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
All subjects randomized to JNJ-[ADDRESS_481789] scheduled clinic visit (Day 14). The first dose adjustment must be 
upwards. Subsequent adjustments may be made upwards or downwards within the study dose ranges 
(20or 40 mg for subjects randomized to JNJ-4284792 2 or 150 or 300 mg for subjects randomized to

known hypothyroidism who have been on stable treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening or for 
subjects with an elevated TSH], and urinalysis). In additi on, emergence of suicidal ideation will be 
assessed using the C -SSRS; potential withdrawal effects will be assessed by [CONTACT_385200]; 
and the effect on sexual functioning will be measured by [CONTACT_385201].
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size Determina tion
The primary purpose of the study is to investigate potential differentiating features between 
JNJ-[ADDRESS_481793] with an overall sample size of 100 subjects (50 in the JNJ -
42847922 group and 50 in the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385122]) provides approximately 92% power at a 1-sided 0.[ADDRESS_481794] ratio of 0.415, assuming the proportion of subjects who discontinue 
from study drug in the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385123] 50%.The planned sample size of the study is consistent 
with the nature of Phase 2 exploratory study.
Efficacy Analysis
The efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set (FAS) which consists of all subjects who were 
randomly assigned to study drug and received at least 1 dose of study drug.
The primary efficacy endpoint, time to all-cause discontinu ation of study drug, will be estimated by [CONTACT_17680] -Meier method and summarized (number of discontinuations, number of censored subjects, 
median, 25th and 75th percentile, if estimable) by [CONTACT_1570]. Time to all-cause discontinuation of 
study drug is defined as the number of days from the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study  
drug. Subjects who complete treatment are not considered to have discontinued. A stratified log-rank test 
(stratified for baseline insomnia status) will be used to test the hypothesis that there is no difference 
between the JNJ-[ADDRESS_481795]-
treatment changes in cortisol levels will be assessed by [CONTACT_1570]. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
and t-test will be used to assess differences across groups and time points. Correlations between cortisol 
levels and clinical endpoints will be evaluated.
The additional exploratory biomarkers will be tabulated by [CONTACT_385202]. Post-treatment changes in exploratory biomarkers will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Associations between baseline biomarker levels and clinical endpoints may be explored. Additional 
exploratory analyses may also be performed. Results of all exploratory analysis will be presented in a 
separate report.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Concentration -time data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_2715], visit date and time 
(relative to dose) for JNJ -42847922, and metabolites M12 and M16 (as applicable).

Safety Analysis
Safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set whic h consists of all subjects who were randomly 
assigned to study drug and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The safety analysis set is the same as the 
FAS.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All 
reported AEs with onset during the double -blind treatment phase and AEs that have worsened since 
baseline (ie, treatment -emergent adverse events [TEAEs]), will be included in the analysis. Serious 
adverse events will be summarized separately.
Laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_385203]. Descriptive statistics will be 
calculated for each laboratory analyte at baseline and for observed values and changes from baseline at 
each scheduled time point.
Descriptive statistics of pulse, supi[INVESTIGATOR_29922] (systolic and diastolic), and 
temperature for observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized at each scheduled time 
point by [CONTACT_3148].
Subjects with abnormal findings in physical examination and ECG wi ll be listed. Changes in body weight 
and waist circumference will be summarized descriptively. Results from the C-SSRS, PWC, and ASEX 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148].

Status: Approved, Date: 26 April [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
JNJ-42847922 (seltorexant) is a potent and selective antagonist of the human orexin -2 receptor
(OX2R , negative log of inhibition constant [pKi]=8) that is being developed for the treatment of 
major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia.
The orexinergic circuits innervate most of the structures implicated in the pathophy siology  of 
mood disorders, as well as in emotional behavior, stress responses, and reward 
processing .4,25,29,34,38,44,63In its role in mediating arousal, orexinergic transmission is driven 
partly  by [CONTACT_385205], a limbic structur e that organizes other behavioral, endocrine, autonomic 
and emotional responses to stressors, threats, rewards, and novelty .44In patients with mood 
disorders, the amygdala manifests abnormally  elevated activity under stress in response to 
emotionally  negative or aversive stimuli, and during sleep.34
While preclinical evidence supports a role for the orexin sy stem in modulating the HPA axis and 
stress -responsiveness, clinical data in support of a role for orexin in depression are fairly  limited. 
In depressed subjects, average cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) orexin levels have not been 
demonstrated to be different from controls, nor to correlate with the severit y of depressive 
illness; however, the diurnal variation of CSF orexin levels has been shown to be blunted in 
subjects with depression, with a trend toward elevated orexin levels in CSF across the entire 
diurnal period. The most striking elevation has been noted at the physiologic nighttime nadir. A 
pathologically  elevated limbic drive from the amygdala in depressed patients may explain this 
finding, and it is possible that normalizing cortisol during that particularly  exaggerated cortisol 
elevation (ie ,during sleep) may  significantly  reduce depressive s ymptoms.
The orexins stimulate two distinct G -protein coupled receptors, orexin -1 (OX1R) and OX2R that 
are co-located or selectively  located in specifi c brain areas suggesting differentiated roles. The 
best-characterized orexinergic system involves the OX2R located on histaminergic neurons in

Warnings and precautions for suvorexant include the risk of next day impairment, including 
impaired driving skills and the potential to fall asleep while driving, and symptoms similar to 
mild cataplex y have been reported with the use of suvorexant. A contributing factor to these risks 
for suvorexant is its long half -life (about 12hours). In contrast, such risks appe ar to be mitigated

The exploratory  efficacy  results from a multiple -dose study  (42847922MDD1001) of
20 mgof JNJ-42847922 in48subjects with MDD showed an early onset (as early as Day 11 of 
exposure) and a clinically  relevant antidepressant effect that was sustained at least [ADDRESS_481818] on sleep- related items. 
A Phase 2b study  (42847922MDD2001) is currently  ongoing to investigate the antidepr essant 
effects of JNJ-42847922 (up to 3 doses [10, 20, and 40 mg] versus placebo), as adjunctive 
treatment to standard of care and to further assess the safet y and tolerability  of JNJ-42847922
over a treatment duration of 6weeks . The study  utilizes the change in the Montgomery -Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to the end of Week 6 as the primary  
endpoint.  
The present study  is being conducted to compare the efficacy  of JNJ-42847922 (20 or 40mg) 
versus quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196] (150 or 300 mg) as adjunctive treatment to standard of care over a 
treatment duration of 6 months (24 weeks) .The primary  endpoint will be time to all-cause 
treatment discontinuation. Efficacy , safet y, and tolerability  will also be assessed to evaluate the 
mainten ance of antidepressant effect over time (including response and remission rates), to 
provide long-term (6-month) safet y information for JNJ-42847922, and to compare the efficacy 
and tolerability  of JNJ-42847922 versus quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385127] 6 months of treatme nt. The doses of 
JNJ-42847922 being evaluated in the present study  (20 and 40 mg) were selected on the basis of 
efficacy , safet y and tolerability  data from Phase 1 clinical studies. Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385128] 3  d rugs approved for the adjunctive treatment of 
patients with MDD in the US and is a commonly -used medication in this treatment setting. The 
doses of quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385129] (150 and 300 mg) are consistent with the 
recommended dose range indica ted in the US prescribing information.

Nonclinical Pharmacology
Safety  Pharmacology
JNJ-42847922 was evaluated in a variet y of in vitro and in vivo models for effects on the 
cardiovascular system. These included the in vitro ion channel assay  in human Ether-à-go-go 
Related Gene (hERG) -transfected HEK293 cells, the isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers assay , an in 
vivo study  in anesthetized guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_385130], and a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) study  in 
conscious dogs. JNJ-42847922 did not show any potentia l for adverse cardiovascular effects. In 
a rat study  to investigate neurobehavioral effects, treatment related changes at ≥250 mg/kg were 
likely  related to exaggerated pharmacology . Findings at 250 mg/kg included slight narrowing of 
the palpebral fissure in all animals with one also display ing a tendency  to decreased body  
temperature, and a minor retardation of visual placing.

In the study  of subjects with insomnia disorder without psychiatric comorbidit y 
(42847922I SM2002), both peak and total (AUC 0-12h) exposures observed were much higher than 
exposures seen in previous studies with the 40-mg dose; the metabolite exposures were 
proportionatel y higher. The higher exposures seen in this study  might be due to increased 
absorption as a result of dosing at bedtime, after dinner. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_385131], there were 
no new safety  findings, deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) observed. None of the subjects 
discontinued the study  due to an adverse event (AE) .

1.3. Overall Rationale for the Study
Major depressive disorder is a common, serious, recurrent disorder, with worldwide lifetime 
prevalence estimates ranging from 8% to 12% in most countries. Its negative impact on role 
functioning in various settings (eg, school performance, marriage, parenting, and the workplace), 
quality  of life, physical health, and life expectan cy has been well- documented. Loss of work 
production and absenteeism due to major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_385137]  30 to 50 billion dollars in annual human capi[INVESTIGATOR_307].27Asof October 
2015, with an estimated 350 million sufferers, depression has been ranked by [CONTACT_385206], and the prevalence is rising.61

Status: Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_481839] -line pharmacologic treatment for MDD is common and represents an 
important unmet medical need. In the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -sponsored 
Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, only 28% of subjects 
achieved remission (defined as a score of ≤7 on the HAM -D17) during first- line treatment with a 
SSRI .46For inadequate response to an optimized trial of first-line antidepressant therapy  (ADT), 
current guidelines recommend switching the ADT, adding a second ADT or adding adjunctive 
therap y with a non-ADT.10,40,52All curren tly approved drugs indicated for adjunctive therap y in 
patients with MDD (including quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and brexipi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]) belong to the at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_385138] , and have tolerability  issues that, in some cases, may  lead to non -adherence. 
Aside from serious risks such as NMS and tardive dyskinesia, these agents are well-known to be 
more commonly  associated with risks such as hypergly cemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], 
weight gain, and next day drowsiness. 
It 
is well- established that sy mptoms of insomnia commonly  occur with major depression epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].[ADDRESS_481840] depressive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_385139]-depressed persons to develop depression by [CONTACT_385207]. Therefore, insomnia is not only a  s ymptom of 
depression, but also a predic tor of depression.24Ongoing sleep problems may contribute to the 
persistence of a depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_385140] a residual symptom of a current depressive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], despi[INVESTIGATOR_385141]. Significant sleep 
symptoms are known to increase relapse risk in patients with MDD.39 
 
 At present, about two-
thirds of depressed patients take sleep medications in addition to their antidepressant regimen. 
The drugs prescribed for this purpose include benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], atypi[INVESTIGATOR_34922] (eg, 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), trazodone, antihistamines, non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_385142], as 
well as non-prescription sleep aids. Some of the most common side effects of these medications

1.4. Overall Risk and Benefit A ssessment
As further described in Secti on 1and the rationale for this study  (Section 1.3), MDD is a 
common, serious, recurrent mental disorder. MDD is the leading cause of disability , and its 
prevalence i s rising.[ADDRESS_481842]-line ADT in patients with MDD (eg, SSRI s and 
SNRI s) are sub-optimally  effective in some patients who require adjunctive treatment, or who 
are otherwise poorl ycompliant because of their associated AEs, such as weight gain and sexual 
side effects. Currently  approved adjunctive treatments are limited to the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_385143], which present considerable tolerability  concerns (eg, metabolic syndrome , akathisia, 
and EPS). The orexin -receptor antagonist class offers a novel mechanism of action that may 
prove to be a valuable alternative in the adjunctive treatment of MDD, but without the side 
effects observed with other medications commonly  used in thi s setting ,such as weight gain, 
sexual side effects, akathisia, or EPS  
 
 
The currentl y available data (see Section 1.1.2 , Clinical Studies, and the JNJ-42847922 
Investigator’s Brochure21) support this clinical study  that investigates the efficacy and safet y of 
JNJ-[ADDRESS_481843] on sleep -related events. 
Additionally , the safet y and tolerability  data so far accumulated for JNJ-42847922 in both 
healthy  subjects and subjects with MDD and/orinsomnia were generally  acceptable based on a 
thorough review of the safet y information from completed clinical studies . No death or SAEs 
were reported after subjects received JNJ-42847922. The most commonly  reported TEAEs were 
somnolence, headache, and dizziness with most TEAEs being mild or moderate in intensity . 
Adverse drug reactions attributed to JNJ-42847922 were sleep paral ysis, somnolence, and 
abnormal dreams. Few subjects reported these events at doses planned for this study  and all were 
self-limited and mild or moderate in intensity . Based on the short half-life of JNJ-42847922, no 
accumulation of study  drug is expected. (Refer to Section 1.1.2 , Clinical Studies, and the 
JNJ-42847922 I nvestigator’s Brochure21for additional details). 
To ensure safe use of the study  drug, besi des routine safet y monitoring and subject management, 
this protocol also includes specific risk mitigation strategies as follows: WOCBP will be

female ratfertilityrates at all doses studied; restrictions on driving, operating machinery , or 
engaging in hazardous activity  when subjects have had less than 6 hours sleep the night before

that are known to have been reported in drugs of thesame pharmacological class (Section 9.7,
Safety  Evaluations/Adverse Events of Special Inter est); and reducing suicidality  risk inherent in 
the underl ying depression by [CONTACT_97480] (Section 4.2, Exclusion Criteria) and 
performing C -SSRS at every  site visit (Section 9.7, Safety  Evaluations/C -SSRS). 
The information obtained to date regarding JNJ-42847922 suggests that the potential benefits to 
patients with MDD in fulfilling an unmet medical need outweigh the identified (ie, ADRs) and 
potentia l risks (see Adverse Events of Special Interest in Section 9.7, Safety  Evaluations) at the 
doses selected for further investigation.

3.1. Overview  of Study  Design
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, parallel -group, flexible -dose, 
6-month (24-week) study  in adult subjects with MDD who have an inadequate response to 
current antidepressant therap y with an SSRI /SNRI.
The study  will consist of 3 phases: an up to 4-week screening phase, a 6-month double -blind 
treatment phase, and a 2-week follow -up phase culminating in a follow -up/end-of-study  visit. 
Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either flexibl ydosed 
JNJ-42847922 (20 or 40 mg) or flexibl ydosed quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196] (150 or 300 mg) as adjunctive 
therap y to their current SSRI  or SNRI . A diagram of the study  design is presented in Figure 1
below.

Status: Approved, Date: 26 April 2018Subjects will continue to take their baseline SSRI /SNRI  antidepressant (at the same dose, 
without change, every  day and at approximately the same time as prior to entering the study ) 
throughout the screening, double -blind, and follow -up phases .
Screening Phase
After providing written informed consent and within [ADDRESS_481857] meet the following criteria:
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5th Edition (DSM -5) diagnostic 
criteria for MDD, without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed 
by [CONTACT_57211] -5 Axis I Disorders –Clinical Trials Version 
(SCI D-CT).
MADRS total score ≥[ADDRESS_481858] not demonstrate a clinically significant 
improvement (ie, an improvement of >20% on their MADRS total score) from the screening 
to baseline visit. It is expected that there will be a minimum of 5 days between screening 
and baseline MADRS.
Inadequate response to at least 1 but no more than 3antidepressants, administered at an 
adequate dose and duration (at least 4 weeks) in the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_17108], as 
assessed by [CONTACT_164245][INVESTIGATOR_307] -Antidepressant Treatment Response 
Questionnaire (MGH -ATRQ).
See Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_481859] at home.
Study  procedures during the double -blind treatment phase to assess efficacy , safety , tolerability , 
compliance, and other evaluations (eg, PK and biomarker) will occur as per the Time and Events 
Schedule. Subjects will be seen at the study  site at baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_481860] AEs and assess any  other issues with tolerability  to the study  medication .
See Section 9.1.3 , Double -blind Treatment Phase for additional details.
End-of-Study /Follow -UpVisit
All subjects will return to the study  site for a follow -up visit within 7 to 14 day s after completion 
of the double -blind phase. At the follow -up visit, safety  assessments/procedures will be 
completed per the Time and Events Schedule. 
If a subject prematurely  withdraws from the study , the End-of-Study  Visit assessments should be 
performed as soon as possible.

Study Evaluations
The primary  endpoint of this study  is time to all-cause discontinuation of study  drug. The 
investigator will be required to complete a detailed summary  of the discontinuation, such as 
reasons and times, utilizing the CRF page. If it is caused by [CONTACT_385210], the clinical course of the AE 
and the outcome ( recovered, resolving, or ongoing) of the AE should be documented.
The efficacy  of the study  drugs (JNJ-42847922 and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196]) will be evaluated using the 
MADRS (SIGMA version ),SIGH-A (HAM -A), CGI-S, SDMT, TMT- Part B, HVLT -R, PGI-S, 
PROMI S-SD (Short F orm 8a), PROMI S-SRI (Short Form 8a), SMDDS, QLDS, and CSD -M. 
These evaluations will be performed at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events 
Schedule.
The safet y and tolerability  of the study  drug will be evaluated throughout the study . In addition
to standard/routine assessments, the safety  assessment in this study  will include the ASEX, 
ESRS -A, C-SSRS, and PWC. Medical resource utilization will be assessed using the HRUQ.
Blood samples for PK and biomarker evaluation will be collected on the study visits specified in 
the Time and Events Schedule. Evening and morning salivary  cortisol samples will be collected 
by [CONTACT_96926], on the day s specified in the Time and Events Schedule.
Blood samples for genetic research will be collected from subject s who consent separately  to this 
component of the study  to allow for the identification of genetic and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_385151], efficacy , safet y, or tolerability  of JNJ-42847922 and to identify  genetic 
and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_385121]. Subject participation in genetic research is 
optional.
3.2. Study Design Rationale
Study Population
In the context of mood disorders, sleep disturbances (both insomnia and hypersomnia) have been 
associated with a suboptimal response to antidepr essant drug therapy , an increased risk for 
relapse (in antidepressant -responsive patients), and prodromal depression.6,7,23,24,58While the 
orexin system promotes wakefulness, increasingly  it is also associated with hyperarousal5and 
motivati onal behaviors.48Hyperarousal characterizes a major subgroup of patients with MDD.[ADDRESS_481863] clinical efficacy  in the treatment of MDD,

Status: Approved, Date: 26 April 2018particularl y in patients with such symptoms, and especially  as an adjunctive therapy  to 
conventio nal antidepressant drug therap y.
The study  population will include adult men andWONCBP (aged 18 to 70 years, inclusive) who 
meet DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for MDD (confirmed by [CONTACT_57404]-CT),14and who have had an 
inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy  with an SSRI /SNRI (administered at an 
adequate dose and duration in the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]).
Unlike many other mental disorders, the age of onset of depression has a wide range, with a 
median onset of early to mid-20s, although significant proportions of patients may experience 
onset between late adolescence to late adulthood. Women have a two-fold increased risk of 
depression over men, and separation and divorce are additional risk factors across the s exes.[ADDRESS_481865] been completed. JNJ-42847922 did not induce any 
developmental alterations (external, visceral, and skeletal) in the fetuses. However, a female rat 
fertility  study suggested a reduction in female fertility . Since it is not know n what the relevance 
of these findings are to a woman’s abilit y to become pregnant after taking JNJ-[ADDRESS_481866] of

Blinding, Control, Treatment Groups
Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385152]-42847922 and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196]. While 3 drugs (quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]) have been approved in the US for the adjunctive treatment of MDD, 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385153]. The data collected 
from this study  will be used to guide phase [ADDRESS_481867] attributes (eg,demographic and 
baseline characteristics) are evenly  balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity 
of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce 
potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.
To test the hypothesis that JNJ-42847922 improves depressive symptoms in subjects with and 
without significant insomnia, randomization will be stratified and rough ly balanced between 
subjects with a baseline ISI score <15 (subclinical or no clinically  significant insomnia) and ≥15 
(moderate to severe insomnia). This distribution will approximately  mimic the prevalence of 
significant insomnia in representative samples of subjects with MDD reported in the literature,

DNA and Biomarker Collection
It is recognized that genetic variation can be an important contributory  factor to interindividual 
differences in drug distribution and response and can also serve as a marker for disease 
susceptibility  and prognosis. Pharmacogenomic research may help to explain interindividual 
variability  in clinical outcomes and may help to identify  population subgroups that respond 
differentl y to a drug. The goal of the pharmacogenomic component is to collect DNA to allow 
the identification of genetic and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_385154], efficacy , safety , 
or tolerability  of JNJ-42847922 and to identify  genetic and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_385155]. Specifically , genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_154865] s relevant to 
depression (HPA axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels,
circadian rh ythm) will be evalua ted.
Increasingl y, it is recognized that psychiatric disorders may be associated with altered 
immune/metabolic activation patterns. Blood and saliva samples will be collected to explore 
biomarkers related to immune system activity , HPA axis activation, and neurotropic factors 
(including but not limited to growth factors, inflammation, or endocrine markers). Many  of these 
factors may be influenced by [CONTACT_385211]; therefore, menstrual cycle will 
be tracked in premenopausal women during the study , by [CONTACT_423]’s verbal report. Biomarker 
samples may help to explain interindividual variability  in clinical outcomes or identify
population subgroups that respond differently  to JNJ-42847922. DNA and biomarker samples 
may be used to help addres s emerging issues and to enable the development of safer, more 
effective, and ultimatel y individualized therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics
In subjects who have shown an inadequate response to their current antidepressant therapy , 
adjunctive treatment with JNJ-42847922 versus quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385156] (ie, outpatient visits, emergency  room visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) as assessed using the 
HRUQ. The HRUQ includes information regarding utilization of healthcare services, including 
the timing of services, enabling changes in level and quantity  of services to be considered as a 
variable in economic models. Refer to Section 9.6for additional details.

Status: Approved, Date: 26 April 2018Efficacy Measures
Primary  Efficacy Measure
The primary  endpoint for this study  will be time to all -cause discontinuation of study  drug.
All currentl y approved drugs indicated for adjunctive therap y in patients with MDD (including 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and brexipi [INVESTIGATOR_4253]) belong to the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_385157], and more commonly  associated with 
risks such as EPS, akathisia, weight gain, hypergl ycemia/diabetes mellitus, and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
These serious tolerability  issues may lead to medication non-adherence or treatment 
discontinuati on. JNJ-[ADDRESS_481872] comparable efficacy  anda lower over-all discontinuation rate when compared to 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196]. Though antidepressant response may occur over 4to 6 weeks (the length of a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_385158] -term trial for MDD), patients usuall y are treated for at least 6-12 months to prevent 
a recurrence of the MDD epi[INVESTIGATOR_385159]. Hence, long-term persistence on 
treatment (a combination of efficacy  and tolerability ) is important for the long-term treatment of 
patients with MDD.
Secondary  Efficacy  Meas ures
MADRS : The 10-item clinician -administered MADRS was designed to be used in subjects with 
MDD to measure the overall severit y of depressive symptoms.33The MADRS scale has been 
selected as a secondary  endpoi nt for this study  because it is validated, reliable, and acceptable to 
regulatory  health authorities as a primary  scale to determine efficacy  in major depression. The 
structure interview guide version (SIGMA) will be used in this study . The SIGMA has been 
shown to achieve high reliability  of MADRS scores in evaluating patients with depression.60
CGI -Sand PGI -S:The CGI-S and PGI -S will be used to allow assessment of minimal clinically  
important difference using an anchor based approach calculated from the global impressions of 
the clinician and the subject.9,16,17,45
SIGH -A(HAM -A): The original 14-item clinician -administered HAM -A scale assesses the 
severit y of different anxiety -related symptoms. It is a commonly  used, validated scale in clinical 
trials assessing anxiety .18,19However, the original HAM -A lacks instructions for administration 
and clear anchor points for the assignment of severity  ratings. For this reason, the structured 
interview guide version (SIGH-A) will be used in this study . The SIGH-A has been shown to 
have high inter -rater and test -retest reliability  and produced similar but consistently  higher (+4.2) 
scores compared to the original HAM -A. Correlation with a self-report measur e of overall 
anxiety  has also been shown to be high.59
PROMIS -SD (short form 8a) and PROMIS -SRI (short form 8a):The PROMI S-SD (Sleep 
Disturbance) instruments assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality , sleep depth, and 
restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting

Status: Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_481874] seven day s.
The PROMI S-SRI (Sleep -Related Impairment) scale consists of [ADDRESS_481875] seven 
days.
QLDS : The QLDS is a disease specific patient reported outcome (PRO )designed to assess 
health related quality  of life in patients with MDD .
SMDDS : The SMDDS is a 16-item instrument which assesses patient-reported symptoms 
associated with MDD .41,42,43,47,56It is a newl y developed PRO developed according to the latest 
standards for PRO development. Initial measurement properties of the SMDDS have been 
assessed in a quantitative pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] .11Data from this non-interventional study  indicate that the 
SMDDS has good measurement properties including internal (Crohbach’s Alpha 0.929) and test 
retest reliability  (ICC 0.848 and Pearson’s r 0.850), and convergent construct and known groups 
validi ty. Sensitivity  to change and interpretation of an important clinical change have yet to be 
evaluated for this new assessment. Its content addresses concepts of negative emotions, anxiety , 
low energy , cognition, sleep disturbance, eating behavior, low motivation, self-blame and self-
harm or suicide ,which represent issues identified during item generation process with subjects 
with MDD.
Subjective sleep parameters : Subjects will be asked to provide answers to questions to 
determine their subjective experien ce of sleep by [CONTACT_385212] a daily sleep diary
(CSD -M).
SDMT :The SDMT is a widel y used, paper -and-pencil assessment of complex scanning and 
visual tracking, requiring elements of attention, visuoperceptual processing, working memory , 
and cognitive/psy chomotor speed.53The test is viewed as a robust screening test for adult 
neurops ychological impairment52and is sensitive to impairments in cognitive fun ction associated 
with MDD .4
TMT -Part B: The TMT -Part B measures divided attention and executive function (tracking and 
sequencing) and is sensitive to cognitive decline associated with MDD.54
HVLT -R:The HVLT -R, a measure of verbal learning and memory , is a 12-item word list recall 
test. Administration includes 3 learning trials, a delay ed recall (20-minute) trial, and a 24-word 
recognition list (including 12 target and 12 foil words).4The test administrator reads instructions 
and word lists aloud, and records words recalled/recognized by [CONTACT_423]. Scores include 
learning, delay ed recall, and recognition. The HVLT -R is awell-validated and widely  used 
measure of verbal epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682] .

morning of Day s 42, [ADDRESS_481877] safet y throu ghout the study .
The homeostatic model assessment will be conducted to estimate changes in beta-cell function 
and insulin sensitivity . The model requires both glucose and insulin measurements. It is known 
that atypi[INVESTIGATOR_385160], including quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_313196],may cause insulin resistance; 
at present, there is no evidence that JNJ-[ADDRESS_481878] measure for suicidal ideation assessment; its use

they are advised to inform the investigator. Such subjects may be discontinued or 
advised not to drive or operate machinery .
5. TREA TMENT ALLOCA TION AND BLINDING
Treatment Allocation
Procedures for Randomization and Stratification
Central randomization will be implemented in this study . Subjects will be randomly  assigned to 
1 of 2treatment groups based on a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared before 
the study  by [CONTACT_43754]. The randomization will be balanced by 
[CONTACT_111126] y permuted blocks and will be stratified by [CONTACT_385217] (significant insomnia 
symptoms [ISI score ≥15]2at baseline versus no significant insomnia symptoms [ISI score <15] 
at baseline) .
The interac tive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique treatment code, which will 
dictate the treatment assignment and matching study  drug kit for the subject. The requestor must 
use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when contact[CONTACT_111127], and will then give the relevant subject details to uniquely  identify  the subject.
Blinding
To maintain the study  blind, the study  drug container will have a label containing the study 
name, study  drug number, and reference number .The label will not identify  the study  drug in the 
container. However, if it is necessary  for a subject's safet y, the study  blind may be broken and 
the identity  of the study drug ascertained. The study  drugnumber will be entered in the case 
report form (CRF) when the study  drug is dispensed. The study  drugs will be identical in 
appearance and will be packaged in identical containers.
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained 
within the IWRS, which has the functionality  to allow the investigator to break the blind for an 
individual subject.
Data that may potentially  unblind the treatment assignment (ie, study  drug concentrations, study 
drug preparation/accountability  data, treatment allocation, and biomarker or other specific 
laboratory  data) will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrit y of the blind is 
maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions, 
such as segregating the data in question from view by [CONTACT_473], clinical team, or others 
as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding. In particular, data regarding

Clinical Protocol 42847922MDD2002 Amendment 2
59
Status: Approved, Date: [ADDRESS_481910] completed 
the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the blind should be broken only if specific 
emergency  treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_35496]. In such cases, the investiga tor may in an emergency  determine the identity  of the 
treatment by [CONTACT_154946] I WRS. It is recommended that the investigator contact [CONTACT_244530], before breaking the blind. Telephone 
contac t with the sponsor or its designee will be available 24hours per day, 7days per week. In 
the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, 
and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the appropriate section of the CRF, andin 
the source document. The documentation received from the IWRSindicating the code break 
must be retained with the subject's source documents in a secure manner .
Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unblinded are requi red to return for an end-of-
study visit.

completed per the Time and Events Schedule. If a subject prematurel y withdraws from the study , 
the End-of-Study  Visit assessments should be performed as soon as possible. 
At the start of the follow -up phase, further clinical/standard of care for the treatment of 
depression will be arranged by  [CONTACT_154941]/or the subject’s treating phy sician. 
The study  will be considered completed after the final study  visit (Week 26) for the last subject 
participating in the stud y.
The duration of participation in the study  for an individual subject (including screening and 
follo w-up visit) will be up to 30 weeks.
9.2. Efficacy Evaluations
The following efficacy  assessments will be performed at the timepoints indicated in the Time 
and Events Schedule. The MADRS (SIGMA) and CGI-S will be administered by [CONTACT_6222], 
centralized remote raters; the SIGH-A(HAM -A), SDMT, TMT-Part B, and HVLT -R will be 
administered by [CONTACT_385222]; and thePGI-S,PROMI S-SD (Short Form 8a), 
PROMI S-SRI (Short Form 8a), SMDDS, QLDS , and CSD -Mwill be completed by  [CONTACT_748].
9.2.1. Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MA DRS)
The MADRS will be performed by [CONTACT_6222], centralized remote raters during the study . The 
MADRS is a clinician -administered scale designed to measure depression severit y and detects 
changes due to antidepressant treatmen t.33The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored 
from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a 
total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS 
evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, 
concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability  to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. 
The test exhibits high int er-rater reliability . The t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_154881] 7 day s.
9.2.2. Clinical Global Impression -Severity  (CGI -S)
The CGI-S will be completed by [CONTACT_6222], centralized remote raters during the study . The 
CGI-S provides an overall clinician -determined summary  measure of the severity  of the subject’s 
illness that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the subject’s 
history , psychosocial circumstances, s ymptoms, behavior, and the impact of the sy mptoms on the 
subject’s abilit y to function.17The CGI-S evaluates the severity  of psy chopathology  on a scale of

experienced rater, the time required to complete the CGI -S is less than 1 minute.
9.2.3. Patient Global Impression -Severity  (PGI -S)
The PGI-S is a self-report scale to measure severity  of illness (1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 
4=severe).45Considering all aspects of depression, subjects will rate their severit y on the PGI-S. 
Its completion time is less than 1 minute.
9.2.4. Structured Interview  Guide Version (SIGH -A) Hamilton A nxiety Rating 
Scale (HA M-A)
The origin al 14-item clinician -administered HAM -A scale assesses the severity  of different 
anxiety -related symptoms. It is a commonl y used, validated scale in clinical trials assessing 
anxiety .18,19However, the original HAM -A lacks instructions for administration and clear anchor 
points for the assignment of severity  ratings. For this reason, the structured interview guide 
version (SIGH -A)will be used in this study . The SIGH-Ahas been shown to have high inter-
rater and test-retest reliability  and produced similar but consistently  higher (+4.2) scores 
compared to the original HAM -A. Correlation with a self-report measure of overall anxiety  has 
also been shown to be high .59
9.2.5. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Sy stem -Sleep 
Disturbance (PROMIS -SD) and Sleep -Related Impairment (PROMIS -
SRI) Short Form s
Developed under a National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative, the Patient Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System captures self-reported, qualitative health aspects in the 
domains of phy sical, mental, and social health.64
The PROMI S-SD Short Form subscale consists of a static 8 item questionnaire. The 
PROMI S-SDinstruments assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality , sleep depth, and 
restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting 
to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy  of and satisfaction with sleep. 
Sleep Disturbance does not focus on symptoms of specific sleep disorders, nor does it provide 
subjective estimates of sleep quantities (total amount of sleep, time to fall asleep, amount of 
wake fulness during sleep). The Sleep Disturbance short form is universal rather than disease -
specific. It assesses sleep disturbance over the past seven days. Its completion time is estimated 
to be less than 5 minutes.
The PROMI S-SRI Short Form subscale consis ts of a static 8 item questionnaire. The PROMI S 
adult Sleep -Related Impairment item bank focuses on self-reported perceptions of alertness, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived functional impairments 
during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness. Though Sleep -Related 
Impairment does not directly  assess cognitive, affective, or performance impairment, it does 
measure waking alertness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and function within the context of overall sleep -wake
function. The Sleep -Related Impairment short form is universal rather than disease -specific. It

less than 5 minutes.
9.2.6. Quality  of Life in Depression Scale (QL DS)
The QLDS is a disease specific PRO designed to assess health related quality  of life in patients 
with MDD .20The instrument has a recall period of "at the moment", contains 34-items with 
"yes"/"no" response options and takes approximately  5to 10 minutes to complete. The score 
range is from 0 (good quality  of life) to 34 (very  poor quality  of life).
9.2.7. Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder Scale (SMDDS)
The SMDDS assesses patient -reported symptoms associated with MDD .41,42,43,47,56The targe t 
population includes adults (aged 18 and older) with a clinical diagnosis of MDD who are being 
treated in an ambulatory  setting. The SMDDS has been developed in a patient sample including 
both males and females, varying levels of age, race, education, marital status, and severity . This 
16-item instrument has a 7 -day recall period, and subjects respond to each question using a rating 
scale between 0 (“Not at all” or “Never”) to 4 (“Extremely ” or “Alway s”). The total score ranges 
from 0 to 60 with a higher s core indicating more severe depressive s ymptomatology .
9.2.8. Subjective Sleep Parameters (Consensus Sleep Diary -Morning 
Administration [CSD -M])
Subjects will be asked to provide answers to questions to determine their subjective experience 
of sleep by  [CONTACT_385212] a daily  sleep diary  (CSD -M).The CSD -M is the only  sleep 
diary  developed with rigorous methodology  for patient reported outcome development, including 
employ ing user/focus group feedback and expert feedback to establish construct validity .It has 
undergone psychometric testing and its content validity  has been confirmed by [CONTACT_385223].8The parameters recorded include:
self-reported sleep onset latency  (sSOL) 
subjective TST (sTST) 
subjective WASO (sWASO) 
subjective number of nighttime awakenings (s nNAW) 
subjective quality  of sleep (sQUAL)  
subjective refreshed feeling on waking (sFRESH)
9.2.9. Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)
The SDMT is a widely used, paper -and-pencil assessment of complex scanning and visual 
tracking, requiring elements of attention, visuoperceptual processing, working memory , and 
cognitive/ps ychomotor speed.53The test is viewed as a robust screening test for adult 
neurops ychological impairment52and is sensitive to impairments in cognitive function associated 
with MDD .4The SDMT measures the time to pair abstract symbols with specific numbers. The 
test includes a coding key consisting of [ADDRESS_481937] symbols, each paired with a number ranging

The TMT -Part B measures divided attention and executive function (tracking and sequencing). 
The subject is instructed to draw a line to connect a set of 25 consecutively  numbered and 
lettered circles, alternating sequentiall y between numbers and letters (ie, 1-A-2-B). The subject is 
instructed to work as quickly  as possible while still maintaining accuracy . The TMT -Part B has 
acceptable reliability ; reliability  coefficients have typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y been reported as exceeding 
0.65.29The TMT -Part B is sensitive to cognitive decline associated with MDD.[ADDRESS_481940] -Revised (HVLT -R)
The HVLT -R, a measure of verbal learning and memory , is a 12-item word list recall test. 
Administration includes 3 learning trials, a delay ed recall (20-minute) trial, and a 24-word 
recognition list (including 12 target and 12 foil words).4The test administrator reads instructions 
and word lists aloud, and records words recalled/recognized by [CONTACT_423]. Scores include 
learning, delay ed recall, and recognition. The HVLT -R is a well-validated and widely  used 
measure of verbal epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682] .
9.3. Pharmacokinetics 
Blood samples of approximately  3mL will be collected for measurement of plasma 
concentrations of JNJ-42847922 and the metabolites M12 and M16 as described bel ow: 
Day 42, Day  84and Day  168 PK sampling 
A single sample will be collected in the morning of Visits 6, 7and 9 within 12 hours 
after the previous dose .
As this is a blinded study , blood samples for PK will be collected from quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -dosed 
subjects, but not analy zed for PK. These samples will be stored and may be analyzed if needed 
(eg, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_385125]). Genetic analy ses will not be performed on these plasma 
samples. Note that there are no dietary  restrictions or fasting requirements prior to blood 
collection for PK assessments.
Subject confidentiality  will be maintained. Additional information about the collection, handling, 
and shipment of biological samples can be found in the Laboratory  Manual.
The exact time of PK blood sample collec tion must be recorded, along with all concomitant 
medications (dose, drug, start and stop date). The exact date and time of the last administration 
of study  drug before the PK sample will be recorded. The exact time of the last meal intake prior 
to dosing before PK sampling on Days42, 84and168 will also be recorded.

Pharmacokinetics
Plasma samples will be analy zed to measure concentrations of JNJ-42847922 and the metabolite 
M12 using a validated, specific, and sensitive liquid chrom atograph y/mass spectrometry /mass 
spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) method by [CONTACT_43754]. The metabolite 
M16 will be analy zed using a scientificall y validated method.
9.3.2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Concentration -time data will be graphicall ydisplay ed by [CONTACT_2715], visit date and time (relative to 
dose) for JNJ -42847922, M12, and M16 and summarized using descriptive statistics.
9.4. Biomarkers 
Venous blood samples will be collected for the assessment of biomarkers as indicated in the 
Time and Events Schedule. To avoid interference caused by [CONTACT_385224], biomarker samples will be collected under fasting conditions 
(for a minimum of 8 hours, water permitted). 
Saliva samples for the measurement of cortisol concentrations will be collected by [CONTACT_385225] (before dosing) and upon awakening as indicated in the Time 
and Events Schedule. Cortisol concentration has a strong diurnal pattern, with peak 
concentrations present upon awakening and low concentrations in the evening hours. Collection 
of saliva cortisol samples (which correlate well with serum concentrations) allows for collection 
at home with a low subject burden. Subjects should not consume alcoholic beverages forat least 
12 hours prior to saliva sampling. Food, drinks (except water), and oral care (brushing, flossing, 
mouthwash) are not permitted 1 hour prior to the saliva collection.
Biomarker analy ses will include (but are not limited to) markers related to theimmune system 
activity , growth factors, metabolic, and HPA axis activation, to allow for exploratory  assessment 
of drug-clinical response relationship, to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes, 
and to identify  population subgroups that respond differentl y to treatment. 
Biomarkers may be added or deleted based on scientific information or technical innovations 
under the condition that the total volume of blood collected will not be increased.
All biomarker data obtained during this study may be included in ongoing cross -study  analyses 
to investigate the relationship between depression severit y and phenot ypes and biomarkers.
Fasting status at the time of biomarker blood collection will be noted on the laboratory 
requisition form and/or theCRF, along with any incidence of illness or allergy  during the 
previous 2 weeks. Information about alcohol consumption within 12 hours prior to saliva 
sampling (including amount/ty pe of alcohol consumed) will be recorded on the CRF. I n addition, 
for preme nopausal women, the average length of menstrual cycle (days) and first day of last 
period will be recorded on the CRF.

Status: Approved, Date: 26 April [ZIP_CODE].5. Pharmacogenomic (DNA ) Evaluations
A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from subjects who consent separatel y to this 
component of the study  (where local regulations permit) to allow for additional research. DNA 
samples will be analy zed for the identification of genetic and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_290055], efficacy , safet y, or tolerability  of JNJ-42847922 and to identify  genetic and/or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_385121]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_385172] (HPA axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, 
circadian rhythm) may be evaluated. Additional analy ses may be conducted if it is hypothesized 
that this may  help resolve issues with the clinical data. 
Subject participation in the pharmacogenomic research is optional and will not affect the abilit y 
of a subject to participate in this study . DNA samples will be used for research related to JNJ-
42847922 and MDD. They  may also be used to develop tests/assay s related to JNJ-[ADDRESS_481943] of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes 
or of the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome or analy sis of the entire genome (as 
appropriate) in relation to JNJ-42847922 and MDD clinical endpoints. Analy ses may be 
performed across multiple studies.
9.6. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics 
Medical resource utiliz ation data, associated with medical encounters, will be collected using the 
HRUQ during the double -blind and follow -up phases of the study . This questionnaire28was 
designed to assess utilization of the followin g resources: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094] (refers to ≥1-night stay ), 
emergency  room visits without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], day or night clinic stays, outpatient treatment .
The questionnaire will be used in the study  as an exploratory  tool. Study  personnel will 
administer the questionnaire. If possibl e, for a given subject, the same person should administer 
this scale at all visits. Note that any resource utilization that is required by [CONTACT_385226].
9.7. Safety  Evaluations
The collection of AEs and concomitant medications will start after the informed consent has

until 4 regular consecutive complexes are available in good readable quality .
During the collection of ECGs, subjects should be in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, 
television, cell phones). Subjects should rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5minutes before 
ECG collection and should refrain from talking or moving arms or legs. If blood sampling or 
vital sign measurement is scheduled for the same time point as ECG recording, the procedures 
should be performed in the following order: ECG, vital signs, blood draw.
Vital Signs (Pulse/Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Temperature)
Blood pressure and pulse/heart rate measurements will be assessed in supi[INVESTIGATOR_385176] a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an 
automated device is not available.
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_97435]/heart rate measure ments should be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] 
5minutes of rest in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones), and standing 
measurements should follow . Standing measurements are to be taken after at least a full minute 
of standing.
In additi on, oral or t ympanic temperature will be measured.
Physical Examination 
The study  investigator, or other authorized and appropriatel y qualified designee, will perform the 
physical examinations. Height will be measured at screening only. Body  weight and waist 
circumference will be measured at screening, and at study  visits as outlined in the Time and 
Events Schedule .
Body weight will be measured using a calibrated scale at each visit. Subjects will be weighed at 
approximately  the same time of day on the same scale, wearing underwear and a gown and 
without shoes; they will be instructed to empty  their bladders before being weighed. (Note: if 
disrobing for weighing is logistically  impossible, the subject should be dressed as lightl y as 
possible, with consisten cy from visit to visit). The scale should be calibrated before the first 
subject is enrolled at the site. Calibration must be documented in the calibration log.

WITHDRA WALFROM THE STUDY
10.1. Completion
A subject will be considered to have completed the double -blind phase if he or she has 
completed assessments at Week 24(ie, Day 168) of the double -blind phase.
A subject will be considered to have completed the follow -up phase if he or she has completed 
assessments at the follow -up vi sit (ie, the visit Days 175 -182).
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study  treatment for any reason before completion of the 
double -blind phase will not be considered to have completed the study .
10.2. Withdrawal From the Study
Because the primary  endpoint ofthis study  is time to all-cause discontinuation, investigators 
should ensure that appropriate withdrawal criteria have been met when withdrawing a subject 
from the study , especially  when subjects are withdrawn due to lack of efficacy . The investigator 
should complete a detailed summary  of the discontinuation, including the reasons for withdrawal 
and time of the withdrawal, in the CRF and in the source document. If the withdrawal results 
from an AE, the clinical course of the AE and the outcome (recovered, resolving, or ongoing) of 
the AE should be documented.
A subject will be automatically  withdrawn from the study  for any  of the following reasons:
Lost to follow -up
Withdrawal of consent
Death
Noncompliance with study  drug administration (ie, missing either 4 or more consecutive 
doses of study  medication or a total of 20 or more doses during the 6-month period)
Investigator's impression of noncompliance with background antidepressant therap y
Discontinuation of study  treatment for any reason. A subject's study treatment will be 
automatically  discontinued if:
The investigator or sponsor believes that for safet y reasons or tolerability  reasons 
(eg,AE) it is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue study  treatment
The subject becomes pregnant 
The subject shows signals of acute suicidal ideation with a clear plan at any time during 
the study ; the subject should be referred to appropriate medical/ps ychiatric care

The collected samples will be retained and used in accordance with the subject's original 
separate informed consent for optional research samples.
The subject may withdraw consent for optional research samples, in which case the samples 
will be destroy ed and no further testing will take place. To initiate thesample destruction 
process, the investigator must notify  the sponsor study  site contact [CONTACT_244538]. The sponsor study  site 
contact [INVESTIGATOR_1318], in turn, contact [CONTACT_385227]. If 
requested, the investigator will receive written confirmation from the sponsor that the 
samples have been destroyed.
Withdrawal From the Optional Research Samples While Remaining in the Main Study
The subject may withdraw consent for optional research samples while remaining in the study . In 
such a case, the optional research samples will be destroy ed. The sample destruction process will 
proceed as described above.
Withdrawal From the Use of Samples in Future Rese arch
The subject may  withdraw consent for use of samples for future research (refer to Section 16.2.5 , 
Long -Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research). In such a case, samples will 
be destroy ed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study . However, if the subject 
withdraws consent after the study  is over, it is possible that the investigator may have alread y 
discarded the subject’s medical records that link the subject’s name [CONTACT_385240]. 
In this case, the subject’s samples would no longer be linked to the subject, and it would not be 
possible to find the subject’s samples for destruction. Details of the sample retention for research 
are presented in the main I CF and in the separate ICF for optional research samples.

Status: Approved, Date: 26 April 201811. STATISTICA L METHODS
Statistical analy sis will be done by [CONTACT_43758]. A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy  and safet y data is o utlined 
below. Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) .
11.1. Subject Information
The efficacy  analyses will be based on the full analy sis set (FAS) which consists of all subjects 
who were randoml y assigned to stud y drug and rec eived at least [ADDRESS_481956] 1 dose of study  drug. The safet y analysis 
set is the same as the FA S.
For all subjects who are randoml y assigned to study  drug, descriptive statistics (eg, study  
completion/withdrawal information, demographic and baseline data) will be provided.
11.2. Sample Size Determination
The primary  purpose of the study  is to investigate potential differentiating features between 
JNJ-[ADDRESS_481957] with an overall sample size of 
100subjects (50in the JNJ-42847922 group and 50in the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385122]) provides 
approximately  92% power at a1-sided 0.10significance level to detect a hazard ratio of 0.415, 
assuming the proportion of subjects who discontinue from study  drug in the quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385177] 50%. The planned sample size of the study is consistent with the nature of a Phase 2 
exploratory  study .67
11.3. Efficacy  Analyses 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint, time to all-cause discontinuation of study  drug, will be estimated 
by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method and summarized (number of discontinuations, number of censored 
subjects, median, 25th and 75th percentile, if estimable) by [CONTACT_1570]. Time to all-cause 
discontinuation of study  drug is defined as the number of days from the first dose of study  drug 
to the last dose of study  drug. Subjects who complete treatment are not considered to have 
discontinued. A stratified log-rank test (stratified for baseline insomnia status) will be used to 
test the hypothesis that there is no difference between the JNJ-42847922 group and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_385178], using a 1 -sided 0. 10significance level.
The analyses for the secondary  efficacy  endpoints will be described in the SAP. For all other 
efficacy  endpoints, no multiplicity  adjustment will be done and nominal p-values will be 
presented.

12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a medicinal 
(investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily  have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investig ational) product, whether or not related to that 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per International 
Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]) .
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF (refer to 
Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_481965] adverse event recording)
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use is any  untoward medical occurrence that a t any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*

Clinical Protocol 42847922MDD2002 Amendment 2
81
Status: Approved, Date: 26 April 2018*Medical and scientific judgm ent should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738]. 
These should usually  be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the study  drug and the event (eg, death from anaph ylaxis), the event must 
be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of 
the study  endpoint (eg, all -cause mortalit y).
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Refer ence Safety Information
An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with the applicable 
product reference safety information. For JNJ-42847922, the expectedness of an AEwill be 
determined b y whether or not it is listed in the Investigator's Brochure. 
For baseline antidepressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, 
fluoxetine, milnacipran, levomilnacipran, sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, 
vilazodone, or vortioxetine) and quetiapi [INVESTIGATOR_385180]/ PI.
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug
An AE is considered associated with the use of the drug if th e attribution is possible, probable, or 
very likely by [CONTACT_23826] 12.1.2 , Attribution Definitions .
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Not Related
An AEthat is not related to the use of the drug .
Doubtful
An AEfor which an alternative explanation is more likely , eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant 
disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely .
Possible
An AEthat might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, eg,concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, 
the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
Probable
An AEthat might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive 
(eg,confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s).

Status: Approved, Date: 26 April 2018Very Likely
An AEthat is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_385230], eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time 
is very  suggestive (eg, it is confirmed by  [CONTACT_35719]).
12.1.3. Severity Criteria
An assessment of severity  grade will be made using the following general categorical 
descriptors :
Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities.
Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity .
Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents normal every day activities.
The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly  
experienced b y the subject (eg, laboratory  abnor malities).
12.2. Special Reporting Situations
Safety  events of interest on a sponsor study  drugthat may require expedited reporting or safet y 
evaluation include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of a sponsor study  drug
Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study drug
Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study  drug
Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to 
the sponsor study  drug , eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Exposure to a sponsor study  drug from breastfeeding
Speci al reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF. Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page 
of the CRF .
12.3. Procedures
12.3.1. All Adverse Events
All AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from 
the time a signed and dated ICFis obtained until completion of the subject's last study -related 
procedure ,which may include contact [CONTACT_20687] -up of safet y. Serious adverse events, including 
those spontaneousl y reported to the investigator within 30daysafter the last dose of study  drug, 
must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor will evaluate any safety

recorded using medical terminology  in the source document and the CRF. Whenever possible, 
diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology  (eg,cough, 
runny  nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_28945]"). Investigators must record in the CRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_90763] y. All measures required for AEmanagement must be recorded in the source 
document and reported according to sponsor instructions.
The sponsor assumes responsibility  for appropriate reportin g of AEs to the regulatory  authorities. 
The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute 
where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) . For anticipated 
events reported as individu al serious adverse events the sponsor will make a determination of 
relatedness in addition to and independent of the investigator’s assessment. The sponsor will 
periodicall y evaluate the accumulating data and, when there is sufficient evidence and the 
spon sor has determined there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused a serious anticipated 
event, they  will submit a safet y report in narrative format to the investigators (and the head of the
investigational institute where required ). The investigato r (or sponsor where required) must 
report S[LOCATION_003]R s to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board 
(IEC/I RB) that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by [CONTACT_12137]/IRB .A S[LOCATION_003]R will be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating 
investigators and IEC/I RB will receive a blinded S[LOCATION_003]R summary , unless otherwise specified .
All subjects will be provided with a "wallet (study ) card" and instructed to carry this card with 
them for the duration of th e study  indicating the following:

adverse event should be made by [CONTACT_6972] (fax).
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054] , or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study , must be followed until 
any of the following occurs:
The event resolves
The event stabilizes
The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available
The event can be attributed to agents other than the study  drug or to factors unrelated to 
study  conduct
It becomes unlikely  that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow -up efforts)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as a 
serious adverse event. Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
that occurs during the course of a subject's participation in a study  must be reported as a serious 
adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385181] (eg, social reasons such as 
pending placement in lo ng-term care facility )
Surgery  or procedure planned before entry  into the study  (must be documented in the CRF ). 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23743], and where the

16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations
Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study  and, during the 
study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue 
partic ipation. They  will be told that their consent to participate in the study  is voluntary  and may  be 
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they 
would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and 
potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled.
The primary  ethical concern is that some subjects who could potentially  benefit from adjunctive 
treatment with JNJ-[ADDRESS_481982]. This will be partiall y mitigated

The spon sor will monitor the study  site and records to ensure compliance with the protocol, and 
that current ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) are followed, and applicable 
regulatory  requirements are adhered to.
Subjects will be monitored for safet y and tolerability  throughout the study , in accordance with 
the Time and Events Schedule. In addition, to ensure subject safet y, subjects should be cautioned 
not to drive or operate machinery  or engage in any potentially  hazardous activities if they have 
had less than a full night’s sleep (6-8 hours) following administration of the study  drug or at any 
time during the study  if the subject feels that his or her baseline capacity  is impaired. At any 
point during the study , if subjects manifest significant next day sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], they are advised to

17.6. Data Quality  Assurance/Quality  Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
study -site personnel before the study , periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456], and direct 
transmission of clinical laboratory  data from a central laboratory  into the sponso r's data base. 
Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples.
Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -sitepersonnel before 
the start of the study .The sponsor will review C RF for accuracy  and completeness during on -site 
monitoring visits and after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with 
the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they 
will be ver ified for accuracy  and consistency  with the data sources. 
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRF 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well asall study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_385235]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custody  must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study

documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institut ionmust permit access to such 
reports.
17.8. Monitoring
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of the visits in a study  site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post-
initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the 
monitor will compar e the data entered into the CRF with the source documents
(eg,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/phy sician’s office medical records) ; a sample may be reviewed .The nature 
and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data 
required to complete the CRF are known to the sponsor and study -site personnel and are 
accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786] -site contact. If electronic records are maintained 
at the study site, the method of verification must be discussed with the study -site personnel .
Direct access to source document s(medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this 
review will be discussed with the study -site personnel . The sponsor expects that, during 
monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be available, the source document swill 
beaccessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related 
documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to 
provide feedback on the study conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during 
these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress 
of the study  at the site.
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion /End-of-Study
The study  is considered completed with the final study  visitfor the last subject participating in 
the study . The final data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after 
completion of the final subject visit at that study  site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.
17.9.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study  completion. A
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study  supplies have been 
collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and suff icient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.

Discontinuation of further study  drug development
17.10. On-Site A udits
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality  assurance department may visit the study  site at 
any time during or after completion of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance 
with regulatory  guidelines and company  policy . These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection. Subject privacy  must, however, be 
respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible for being present and 
available for consultation during routinely  scheduled study -site audit visits conducted by [CONTACT_385236]. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_23865], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor if he or shehas
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  concerning an upcoming inspection.
17.11. Use of Information and Publication
All information, including but not limited to information regarding JNJ-42847922 or the 
sponsor 's operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific 
data, prior clinical data, formulation information) supplied by [CONTACT_66894], and any data, including pharmacogenomic or exploratory  biomarker
research data, generated as a result of this study , areconsidered confidential and remain the sole 
propert y of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and 
use this information only to accom plish this study, and will not use it for other purposes without 
the sponsor's prior written consent.
The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by [CONTACT_244548]-42847922 , and thus may be 
disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory  agencies. To permit the 
information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide 
the sponsor with all data obtained in th e study .
The results of the study  will be reported in a Clinical Study  Report generated by [CONTACT_170195] . Recruitment

connection with performance of the study  and contained in the data that can benefit from 
copy right protection (except any publication by [CONTACT_40999]) shall be 
the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of cop yright in such work.
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary  (multicenter) data 
and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish 
study  site-specific data after the primary  data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish 
information from the study ,a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review 
at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be 
arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by [CONTACT_170196], the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60days to allow 
for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity  or 
regulatory  compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor 
will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress 
information. Formulticenter study  designs and substudy  approaches, secondary  results generall y 
should not be published before the primary  endpoints of a study  have been published. Similarly , 
investigators will recognize the integrity  of a multicenter study by [CONTACT_41055], within 12 months of the availability  of the final data (tables, 
listings, graphs), or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study  publication. 
Authorship of publications resulting from this study  will be based on the guidelines on 
authorship, such as those described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to 
Biomedical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant 
contribution to the design of the study  or analy sis and interpretation of the data, provided critical 
review of the paper, and given final approval of the final version.
Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results
The sponsor will register and disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as 
required b y law.

Status: Approved, Date: 26 April 2018Attachment 2:Anticipated Events
Anticipated Event
An anticipated event is an adverse event (serious or non -serious) that commonly occurs as a consequence 
of the underlying disease or condition under investigation (disease related) or backgro und regimen.
For the purposes of this study the following events will be considered anticipated events: 
Suicidal thinking, ideation/ behavior,
Sleep changes/difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], reduced sleep, abnormal sleep, tiredness, fatigue, reduced energy,
Difficulty in sexual desire, performance or satisfaction,
Reduced appetite, weight changes (loss or increase),
Irritability, anger, impulsive behavior, 
Agitation, feeling anxious/anxiety, tension, panic attacks, phobia.
Reporting of Anticipated Events
All adverse events will be recorded in the CRF regardless of whether considered to be anticipated events 
and will be reported to thesponsor asdescribed in Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events . Any anticipated 
event that meet s serious adverse event criteria will be reported to the sponsor as described in 
Section 12.3.2 , Serious Adverse Events. These anticipated events are exempt from expedited reporting as 
individual single cases toHealth Authorities. However ,if based on an aggregate review, it is determined 
that an anticipated event is possibly related to study drug, the sponsor will report these events in an 
expedited manner.
Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC)
An Anticipate d Event Review Committee (ARC) will be established to perform reviews of pre-specified 
anticipated events at an aggregate level. The ARC is a safety committee within the sponsor’s organization 
that is independent of the sponsor’s study team. The ARC will meet to aid in the recommendation to the 
sponsor’s study team as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that an anticipated event is related to 
the study drug.
Statistical Analysis
Details of statistical analysis of anticipated events, including the frequency of review and threshold to 
trigger an aggregate analysis of anticipated events will be provided in a separate Anticipated Events 
Safety Monitoring Plan (ASMP).

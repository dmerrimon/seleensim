TITLE : Prospective, Multi-center, Open-label Study Measuring Safety and Treatment 
Satisfaction in Adult Subjects with Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) after Switching to 
Avatrombopag from Eltrombopag or Romiplostim
PROTOCOL NUMBER: AVA-ITP-401 
PROTOCOL VERSION/DATE: V2.0/[ADDRESS_364460]: Avatrombopag oral tablet
PHASE: 4
RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND: Chronic ITP is an autoimmune disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_298698]. The clinical management of ITP 
depends on its severity and the bleeding risk.  Treatment is considered when platelet counts fall 
below 30 to 50×109/L with a goal to maintain platelet counts in a target range of 50 to 150 -
200×109/L, so patients can live relatively active lives with a manageable bleeding risk.  The 
standard of care after a failure of 1st line therapy includes the initiation of a thrombopoietin
receptor agonist (TPO-RA) (Provan,  2019).  Three TPO-RAs (eltrombopag [Promacta®], 
romiplostim [Nplate®], and avatrombopag [DOPTELET®]) are currently approved in the United 
States (US) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic ITP who have 
had an insufficient response to a previous treatment.  
Avatrombopag (DOPTELET) was approved in June [ADDRESS_364461] had an insufficient response to a previous treatment.  
It is an orally administered small molecule that mimics the biological effects of thrombopoietin
(TPO) vitro and in vivo. In clinical trials, avatrombopag increased platelet counts within 3- 5 days 
and maintained them in the target range (50 to 150×109/L) with chronic dosing (Jurczak, 2018 ).
Further, it has an exposure-adjusted safety profile generally comparable to placebo, no boxed 
safety warning for hepatotoxicity, and is recommended to be taken with food. 
Eltrombopag is taken orally, however, the tablets must be taken on an empty stomach or with a 
low calcium meal and 2 hours before or 4 hours after any antacids, dairy products, or mineral 
supplements containing polyvalent cations. Romiplostim requires a weekly subcutaneous injection 
which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_298685]’s healthcare provider.  
The US Prescribing Information (USPI) for eltrombopag, romiplostim, and avatrombopag 
recommends using the lowest dose needed to achieve and maintain a platelet count 50×109/L, as 
necessary, to reduce the risk of bleeding in patients with ITP. Dose adjustment guidelines in the 
USPI [INVESTIGATOR_298686] a dose of 75 mg once daily, 
10 µg/kg once weekly, and 40 mg once daily for eltrombopag, romiplostim, and avatrombopag, 
respectively; the goal of dos e adjustments should not be to normalize platelet counts. Additionally, 
the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_298687]- RA if the platelet count does not increase to a 
level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks of therapy at the m aximum 
dose.

Version 2.0, [ADDRESS_364462] shown that switching to an alternate TPO- RA may be beneficial if 
there was an insufficient response to treatment with the initial TPO- RA, which may be due to 
refractoriness to the previous treatment or non-compliance with the treatment regimen (Kuter ,
2015).  Although there are now [ADDRESS_364463] 
reported treatment satisfaction after receiving avatrombopag for 90 days following treatment with 
either eltrombopag or romiplostim.  The initial dose and dose adjustments of avatrombopag wil l 
be determined by [CONTACT_737], per the DOPTELET USPI.   There is no protocol- required 
washout period between treatment with TPO-RAs, however avat rombopag should not be 
administered on the same day as another TPO- RA. The start and stop dates of all prior and 
concomitant medications should be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Version 1.[ADDRESS_364464] reported outcomes after switching from eltrombopag or romiplostim to 
avatrombopag, the TSQM will be administered at Baseline (before the first dose of 
avatrombopag), Day 30, and Day 90.  
STUDY OBJECTIVES:
Primary Objective: Characterize the safety and tolerability of avatrombopag given for 90 days 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_298688].  
Secondary Objectives: 
 Evaluate the change in subject reported outcomes from Baseline after switching to 
avatrombopag from eltrombopag or romiplostim. 
 Evaluate the platelet counts after switching to avatrombopag from eltrombopag or 
romiplostim.  
STUDY ENDPOINTS:
Primary Endpoint: Occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).  
Secondary Endpoints :
 Change from Baseline in each of the 4 domains of the TSQM Version 1.4 (e.g., 
convenience, global satisfaction, effectiveness, and side effects) to Day [ADDRESS_364465] a platelet count between 50×109/L to 200×109/Lat

Version 2.0, 28 January 2022  6  STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: This Phase 4, prospective, multi-center, open- label study 
will evaluate safety, platelet count, and subject reported medication satisfaction in adult subjects 
with chronic ITP after switching to avatrombopag from eltrombopag or romiplostim.  At least 
100 subjects will b e enrolled, 50 (±10) who have received eltrombopag and 50 (±10) who have 
received romiplostim for at least 90 days prior to study entry. 
The initial dose and dose adjustments of avatrombopag will be determined by [CONTACT_298699].  There is no protocol- required washout period between 
treatment with TPO-RAs, however avatrombopag should not be administered on the same day as 
another TPO- RA. The start and stop dates of all prior and concomitant medications should be 
recorded in the eCRF.
Safety will be evaluated throughout the study.  Bleeding severity will be captured using the Wo rld 
Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale at each visit. Platelet counts will be collected per 
protocol at Baseline, Day 15, Day 30, Day [ADDRESS_364466]’s standard of care while they are enroll ed in the study should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  The TSQM will be administered prior to the first dose of avatrombopag (at Baseline), 
at Day 30, and at Day [ADDRESS_364467]’s standard of care.    
Subjects may be screened within [ADDRESS_364468] participation and collection of 
clinical data will be a minimum of 90 days from the Screening Visit/Visit [ADDRESS_364469] is early terminated, the early termination assessments should be completed prior to 
discharge from the study.

Version 2.0, [ADDRESS_364472] in the TSQM assessment is the convenience doma in score. The hypothesis is 
that switching from a prior TPO-RA treatment (eltrombopag or romiplostim) to avatrombopag 
results in an improvement in the convenience domain score. Change from Baseline to Day 90 (or 
End of Study) in the convenience domain score will be tested using paired t-tests, by [CONTACT_298701] -
RA treatment (eltrombopag vs romiplostim) and overall.  
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: 
Assuming the mean TSQM convenience scores at Baseline and at the end of study are [ADDRESS_364473] deviation (SD) of 19, 50 subjects will provide 83% power to detect 
a change from Baseline of [ADDRESS_364474]. The 
total sample size will be 100 subjects which includes approximately 50 subjects with a prior 
treatment of eltrombopag and approximately 50 subjects with a prior treatment of romiplostim.

Version 2.0, 28 January 2022  14  1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Thrombocytopenia 
Platelets originate from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and are an important component of 
blood that function to maintain normal hemostasis by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_298690].  In healthy 
individuals, the average lifespan of platelets is 7 to 10 days, after which they are destroyed and 
replaced with newly generated platelets from the bone marrow.  A normal blood platelet count
ranges from 150×109/L to 450×109/L, and patients who have less than 150×109/L have the 
condition known as thrombocytopenia, which is associated with easy or excessive bruising and 
mild to severe or potentially fatal bleeding.
Thrombopoietin (TPO), the principal physiologic regulator of platelet production, is produced 
constitutively in the liver, circulates in the bloodstream, and is delivered to the bone marrow, where 
it stimulates the early development of multiple hematopoietic lineages leading to 
megakaryocytopoiesis.  This results in the production of new platelets by [CONTACT_245945], a 
process which is directly correlated with plasma TPO levels.
The circulating platelet count in the blood is determined by [CONTACT_298702].  Thrombocytopenia can result from decreased platelet production in the bone 
marrow, increased platelet destruction in the blood (such as from autoantibodies), sequestration of 
platelets in the spleen, and/or the dilution of platelets following multiple blood transfusions.  There 
are numerous disease states which cause thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP), chronic liver disease (CLD), and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT). 
1.2 Immune Thrombocytopenia 
ITP is an autoimmune disorder characterized by [CONTACT_298703] a combination of 
both impaired platelet production and increased peripheral platelet destruction.  It has an incidence 
of as many as 5 out of every 100,000 people and may be either a primary condition or secondary 
to other causes, such as bacterial or viral infections.  The 2019 International Consensus Report on the Investigation and Management of ITP (Provan, 2019) and the American Society of 
Hematology Guidelines for ITP (Neunert , 2019) define ITP in [ADDRESS_364483] subsets in accordance 
with disease duration, which includes:  
 Newly Diagnosed ITP: within 3 months of the diagnosis
 Persistent ITP: within 3 to 12 months of the diagnosis
 Chronic ITP: more than 1 year after the diagnosis 
Clinical management of ITP depends primarily on its severity, with initial therapy being indicated 
when platelet counts fall below 30 to 50×109/L with a goal to maintain platelet counts between 50 
to 200×109/L to reduce the risk of concurrent bleeding symptoms or impact on health-related quality of life (Neunert, 2019; Provan, 2019).  The clinical goal of treatment for ITP is not to 
normalize platelet counts, but to increase platelet counts to a level that enables patients to live 
relatively normal and active lives with a manageable risk of bleeding. For the treatment of newly 
diagnosed ITP in patients who have non-life-threatening bleeding, agents that decrease platelet 
destruction (e.g., corticosteroids or immunoglobulins) are recommended as 1st line treatment.  
These medications have variable and transient efficacy and significant toxicities.

Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 2.0, 28 January 2022  15  After the failure of a 1stline therapy, 2ndline treatment options approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) 
for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic ITP who have had an 
insufficient response to a previous treatment include the TPO receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) 
avatrombopag (DOPTELET®), eltrombopag (Promacta®), and romiplostim (Nplate®).   
The US Prescribing Information (USPI) for avatrombopag, eltrombopag, and romiplostim 
recommends using the lowest dose needed to achieve and maintain a platelet count 50×109/L, as 
necessary, to reduce the risk of bleeding in patients with ITP. Dose adjustment guidelines in the 
USPIs of TPO-RAs are based on platelet count response and should not exceed a dose of 40 mg 
once daily, 75 mg once daily, or 10 µg/kg once weekly for avatrombopag, eltrombopag, and 
romiplostim, respectively; the goal of dose adjustments should not be to normalize platelet counts.  
Additionally, each of the [ADDRESS_364484] be taken with a meal low in calcium (50 mg) and 2 hours before 
or 4 hours after other medications (e.g., antacids), calcium-rich foods (containing >50 mg calcium 
[e.g., dairy products, calcium-fortified juices, and certain fruits and vegetables]), or supplements 
containing polyvalent cations, such as iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, selenium, and zinc, 
which may be challenging for patients.  Romiplostim requires weekly subcutaneous injections which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_298691]’s healthcare provider (Promacta USPI ; Nplate USPI ; 
Neunert , 2019; Provan, 2019).  
Observational studies have shown that switching to an alternate TPO-RA may be beneficial if the 
patient had an insufficient response to treatment with the initial TPO-RA, which may be due to 
refractoriness to the previous treatment or non-compliance with the treatment regimen (Kuter,  2015).  Data also suggests that switching to an alternate TPO-RA in order to improve convenience 
in patients who are responding to their current TPO-RA therapy may yield continued efficacy (Kuter, 2015).  Although there are now 3 approved TPO-RA options for adult patients with ITP, 
data on clinical outcomes, treatment responses, and patient reported outcomes among patients who 
switch TPO-RAs for the treatment of ITP are limited.  
1.3 Avatrombopag 
Avatrombopag maleate is an orally administered, small molecule TPO-receptor (c-Mpl) agonist
that mimics the biologic effects of TPO in vitro and in vivo, resulting in a measured increase in 
platelet counts.  Like other TPO receptor agonists, avatrombopag activates the human TPO 
receptor, but binds to a different site on the receptor than endogenous TPO. After binding, 
avatrombopag stimulates signal transduction and mimics the biologic effects of TPO, which in 
turn increases platelet counts.  Given its basic mechanism of action, by [CONTACT_298704], avatrombopag has the potential to be 
useful for the treatment of thrombocytopenia of any etiology across a variety of indications and 
patient populations when used in both acute and chronic dosing regimens.Avatrombopag has been approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for the 
treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with CLD who are scheduled to undergo a 
procedure and for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ITP who have had an insufficient 
response to a previous treatment (DOPTELET  USPI ).

symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs will be monitored and documented from the time of informed consent until study participation 
is complete. Subjects should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigator. 
Beginning with the informed consent signature, Investigators should make an assessment for AEs 
at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE eCRF. Events associated with disease 
progression should not be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, if in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_298693], the associated events 
should be reported as AEs/SAEs, as appropriate. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome (i.e., diagnosis) rather than individual 
associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_76768]. 
However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific 
disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at Screening should not be reported as an AE unless the 
medical condition or signs or symptoms present at Screening change in severity, frequency or 
seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination findings that are detected during 
the study or are present at Screening and significantly worsen during the study should be reported 
as AEs. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal finding is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, 
stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error 
does not require reporting as an AE.

 Mild – A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living. 
 Moderate – A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort 
but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant. 
 Severe – A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.

Version 2.0, 28 January 2022  32  [IP_ADDRESS]  Causality Assessment 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of avatrombopag is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: 
 No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of 
avatrombopag and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship 
and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected.
 Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of avatrombopag and the 
occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship and no other 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified. 
o The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the 
event and avatrombopag.  This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments
to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: The temporal sequence from avatrombopag administration- 
o The event should occur after avatrombopag is given. The length of time from 
avatrombopag exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the 
event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases-
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of 
the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have. 
 Concomitant drug(s)- 
o The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event 
in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of medication- 
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely 
to be a class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses- 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the subject and provide a 
logical and better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of avatrombopag- 
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion) of avatrombopag should be considered.

An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes:
 Death, 
 A life-threatening AE, 
o NOTE: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.

o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient

reporting form within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any AE that 
meets any of the aforementioned serious criteria). All SAEs that the Investigator considers causally 
related to avatrombopag occurring after discharge from the study must be reported to the Sponsor. 
To report the SAE, complete the appropriate form for the study and submit to the Sponsor or 
designee as instructed on the form. It is very important that the form be filled out as completely as 
possible at the time of the initial report.  This includes the Investigator’s assessment of causality. 
The Investigator must notify his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the occurrence of the 
SAE, in writing, if required by [CONTACT_1385].  A copy of this communication must be forwarded 
to the Sponsor to be filed in the Sponsor’s Trial Master File.
After discharge from the study, if the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE which, per the 
Investigator, is attributable to avatrombopag treatment, the event should be reported to the Sponsor 
within [ADDRESS_364516] until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), the subject 
is lost to follow-up, or the subject dies.
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 1 business day of its 
receipt.  If the follow-up information changes the Investigator’s assessment of causality, this 
should also be noted on the appropriate SAE follow-up form. Preliminary SAE reports should be 
followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_123273][INVESTIGATOR_3103], 
autopsy reports, and other documents requested by [CONTACT_1034].

AESIs throughout their participation in this study.  The purpose for specifying these AESI is to 
enable further characterization of the clinical course and management of these events.  An AESI 
may or may not be the consequence of treatment with avatrombopag.
The AESIs defined in this protocol include: Thromboembolic events (any thrombotic or embolic event, whether arterial or venous) 
 Bleeding events (any clinically significant blood loss [e.g., WHO Grade 2 or higher]).

fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 
9.7 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs include:  
 Prompt notification by [CONTACT_67852], or designee, of an SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
 The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor, or designee, will comply with country-specific regulatory 
requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB, and Investigators.   Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy.  These 
safety reports will be forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
 An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing a S[LOCATION_003]R or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of S[LOCATION_003]Rs) from the Sponsor will 
review the report, file it, and will notify the IRB, if appropriate, according to local 
requirements.

obtained. The protocol, ICF, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the 
subjects, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be 
provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_737]. 
The Investigator is obligated to keep the IRB informed of any unanticipated problems. This may 
include notification to the IRB of Investigational New Drug (IND) Safety Reports. 
Federal regulations and ICH guidelines require that approval be obtained from an IRB prior to 
participation of subjects in research studies. Prior to study onset, the protocol, any protocol 
amendments, ICFs, or advertisements to be used for subject recruitment, and any other written 
information regarding this study to be provided to a subject must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
The study will only start in the respective sites once the IRB’s written approval has been given.
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB authorization has been received 
by [CONTACT_1034].
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor, or their designee, to obtain the approval of the responsible

12.5 Study Monitoring Requirements 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with 
the protocol, Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements, and that 
valid data are entered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized and easily retrievable data. Before 
the enrollment of any subject in this study, the Sponsor or their designee will review with the 
Investigator and site personnel the following documents: protocol, USPI, eCRFs and procedures 
for their completion, ICF process, and the procedure for reporting SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor or their designee to monitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During 
the monitoring visits/calls, information recorded on the eCRFs may be verified against source 
documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is entered 
by [CONTACT_779], the monitor will review the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, and 
logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and 
provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities, including visits and calls, will be reported and archived. In addition, on-
site monitoring visits will be documented at the investigational site by [CONTACT_298713]-specific monitoring log.

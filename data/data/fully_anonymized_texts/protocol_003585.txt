STUDY  OUTLINE  
 
Title of Study: Prospective, multinational, non -interventional post -authorisation study to  
document the long -term immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Human -cl rhFVIII in 
patients  with haemophilia  A treated  in routine  clinical  practice  
Study Rationale: Data from pre -authorisation studies are insufficient to estimate all  
aspects of therapy with FVIII products, especially with respect to immunogenicity.  
Therefore, to estimate the likelihood of rare side effects, such as the occurrence of F VIII 
inhibitors, and to bridge between the outcome from clinical trials and long -term clinical  
use, the purpose of this study is to assess the long -term immunogenicity, safety, and  
efficacy  of Nuwiq®  in patients  with haemophilia  A treated  in routine clinic al practice.  
Specifically,  the study  is designed  to meet  the requirements  for post-authorisation  studies  
as outlined in the ‘Guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human  
plasma -derived factor VIII products’ by [CONTACT_827096] (EMA),  
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009.  
Study Objectives: In addition to general product safety and efficacy, the focus of this  
study will be on immunogenicity, particularly on inhibitor development  
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009).  The objectives  of this study  are: 
• To assess  the long-term immunogenicity  and safety  of Nuwiq®  in treating  or 
preventing  bleeding  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  (BEs)  in patients  with haemophilia  A 
• To assess  the long-term efficacy  of Nuwiq®  in treating  or preventing  BEs in patients  
with haemophilia  A 
Study  Design:  Prospective,  multinational,  non-interventional  post-authorisation  study  
Study  Population  
According to Guideline EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009, the number of patients  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_827080] a post-authorisation  study  with FVIII  to cover  immunogenicity  aspects  
is 200.  
• The goal is to collect  data on 200 previously  treated  male  patients  of any  age with 
haemophilia  (FVIII:C  ≤ 2%).  
• Of the [ADDRESS_1147429] severe haemophilia A  
(FVIII:C  < 1%).  
• The age distribution  of enrolled  patients  should  be evenly  balanced;  thus,  approx.  
60 patients  should  be < 12 years  of age; also, at least 10 patients  should  be aged  
between  14–18 years.  
• Patients  with severe  haemophilia  A after successful  immune  tolerance  induction  
(ITI)  can also be included;  the proportion  of ITI patients  should  not exceed  25% of 
the entire  cohort.

Optional  PK assessment  
An optional PK assessment to determine prophylactic treatment regimen of a patient may  
be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician. The dose and dosing interval will  
be calculated in the frame of this non -interventional study either based on an individual  
PK with 6 - 10 time points or on a population -based PK using 1 -3 time points (including  
the possibility to combine 1 to 2 time -points from different infusions of Nuwiq® at the  
dose patient is routinely treated with). The  population -PK option uses WAPPS (wapps - 
hemo.org) to model collected FVIII activity data from the withdrawn time -points and to  
provide an estimation of the patient PK. WAPPS is developed and provided online by  
[CONTACT_827099] (Hamilton, Ontario Canada ). Patients will consent to participate in  
this optional  assessment.  
Optional  Quality  of Life assessment  (SF-36 Health  Survey)  
Patient’s health -related quality of life may be measured using SF -36 health survey. This  
assessment will be performed only in countries where it is not considered interventional.  
Patients will consent prior to receiving the questionnaire. SF -36 health surv ey will be  
done  at screening,  every  6 months  after enrolment  and at completion  visit.  
 
Duration of Treatment: Patients from pre -authorisation studies can be followed up to at  
least [ADDRESS_1147432] 100 EDs, provided that:  
• Age distribution is balanced (approx. 60 p atients < 12 years of age; at least 10  
patients  aged between 14 –18 years)  
• At least [ADDRESS_1147433]  severe  haemophilia  A (FVIII:C <1%)  
• The proportion  of ITI  patients  does not exceed  25% of the entire  cohort

been  commercially  available  [1]. 
Thus far, commercial unmodified recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) concentrates have been  
expressed in hamst er cells. However, products derived from hamster cells may contain  
contaminants of non -human origin that may give rise to immune reactions. Also, the post - 
translational modifications of these proteins expressed in hamster cells are not identical to  
those of native human FVIII, potentially leading to immunogenic reactions and the  
development  of inhibitors against rFVIII  [2, 3] . 
Octapharma has developed Nuwiq® (simoctocog alfa), a fourth -generation recombinant  
human  factor  VIII (rhFVIII)  concentrate  for the control  and prevention of  bleeding  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (BEs) and for surgical prophylaxis in patients with haemophilia A. In Europe,  
marketing  authorisation  for Nuwiq®  was obtained  through  the centralised  procedure  on [ADDRESS_1147438]  Description  
 
Nuwiq® is a B -domain deleted rhFVIII produced in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK  
293F) [4]. Nuwiq® has been shown to be highly pure, with host -cell protein and DNA  
traces comparable to, or lower  than, other marketed rFVIII products [5]. Nuwiq® has a high  
specific FVIII activity and characteristics similar to full -length rFVIII products. Nuwiq®  
displayed  a higher  binding  capacity  with von Willebrand  factor  (VWF)  than comparator  
Study  Protocol

products, thus minimizing circulating unbound FVIII and further reducing the potential risk  
of inhibitor  development [5]. 
For rhFVIII, glycosylation and sulfation are vital for functional ity and VWF binding  
affinity. Nuwiq® has been shown to be sulfated and glycosylated in ways comparable to  
human -plasma -derived FVIII. Most importantly, Nuwiq® is devoid of the antigenic  
Neu5Gc or alpha -Gal epi[INVESTIGATOR_827081] - and Ba by [CONTACT_827100] -derived rFVIII products. Both the avoidance of non -human glycan structures and  
the achievement of complete sulfation are proposed to lower the intrinsic immunogenicity  
of Nuwiq®  compared with  current  rFVIII  products [6]. 
For more detailed product information, refer to Section [ADDRESS_1147439]

2.2.1 Results  from  Clinical  Studies  for Market  Authorisation  
The clinical  study program for  market  authorisation  was developed with  consideration  of 
both EU and [LOCATION_003] guidelines. Final results are available from 5 studies in a total of 135  
previously treated patients. Nuwiq® was bioequivalent to the licensed full -length rFVIII  
Kogenate FS, with the ratio of the geometric means [90% CI] for AUC norm (Nuwiq®  
relative to Kogenate FS) within the accepted range for bioequivalence of 0.8 to 1.25, and it  
was safe and efficacious in preventing and treating BEs. In particular, no inhibitor w as 
detected, and no unexpected adverse event (AE) or related SAEs were reported in any of  
the studies.  
 
2.2.2 Therapeutic  Indications  
Nuwiq® is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in paediatric and adult  
patients  with haemophilia  A (congenital  factor  VIII deficiency).  
 
2.2.3 Benefit -Risk  Statement  
Based on the available clinical evidence, Nuwiq® is safe and effective in the prevention and  
treatment of BEs and during surgical prophylaxis in patients with inherited FVIII  
deficiency.

Summary  of safety  profile  
• Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and  
stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives,  
hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restle ssness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest,  
tingling,  vomiting,  wheezing)  have  rarely  been  observed  with FVIII  preparations  and 
may in some  cases  progress to  severe  anaphylaxis  (including  shock).  
• Patients  with haemophilia  A may develop  neutralising  antibodies  (inhibitors)  to factor  
VIII. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest as an insufficient clinical  
response.  In such cases,  the patient should  contact  [CONTACT_4145]. 
 
Tabulation  of ADRs  seen in the clinical  development  program  of Human -cl rhFVIII  
In clinical studies with Nuwiq® in previously treated paediatric (2 to 11 years, n = 58),  
adolescent (12 to 17 years, n = 3) and adult patients (n = 74) with severe haemophilia A, a  
total of 8 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (6 in adults, 2 in children) were reported in 5  
patients  (3 adults, 2 children).  
Table  1 is sorted  by [CONTACT_476205]  (SOC)  and Preferred  Term  (PT).

Description  of selected  ADRs  
One case of non -neutralizing anti -factor VIII antibody was detected in one adult patient  
(see Table  1). The sample  was tested  by [CONTACT_827102].  The result  
was positive only at dilution factor 1, and the antibody titre was very low. Inhibitory  
activity,  as measured  by [CONTACT_827103], was  not detected  in this patient.  
Clinical  efficacy  and in-vivo recovery  of Nuwiq®  was not affected  in this patient.  
 
Paediatric  population  
The frequency, type, and severity of ADRs in children are assumed to be the same as in  
adults.  
 
2.3 Study  Rationale  
 
The number of patients enrolled in the pre -authorisation clinical studies with Nuwiq® was 
135 (see Section 2.2.1 ), which is considered adequate to provide relevant information on  
general safety aspects and to demonstrate the e fficacy of Nuwiq® in terms of its ability to  
restore factor VIII levels and stop or prevent bleeding. However, data from pre - 
authorisation studies are insufficient to estimate all aspects of therapy with FVIII products,  
especially  with respect  to immunoge nicity  (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009).  
Therefore, to estimate the likelihood of rare side effects, such as the occurrence of FVIII

Study  Protocol  
No. GENA -[ADDRESS_1147442] -authorisation study designed to  
assess the long -term immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Nuwiq® in patients with  
haemophilia  A treated in  routine  clinical practice.  
The study  design  complies  with Guideline  EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009.  In brief,  
200 male patients of any age with haemophilia (FVIII:C ≤ 2%) will be treated and followed  
for at least [ADDRESS_1147443] severe  
haemophilia A (FVIII:C < 1%). The overall duration of this study will be approximately 4  
years. The testing schedule for FVIII inhibitors as predefined in Guideline  
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  is given in Table  3. 
 
5 STUDY  POPULATION  
According to Guideline EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009, the number of patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_827082] a post -authorisation study with FVIII to cover immunogenicity aspects is 200. In  
a cohort of 200 patients and assum ing an inhibitor incidence of 1.5% or higher, there is at  
least 95% probability  to observe  antibodies  in one  or more  patients.  
An EMA expert meeting on FVIII products and inhibitor development agreed that the risk  
of inhibitor formation related to an individual product should be evaluated in previously  
treated patients (PTPs), because patients with a high degree of previous exposu re should be  
immunotolerant to FVIII and are considered to be a better suited study population  
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009).  
• Therefore, the goal is to collect data on 200 previously treated male patients of any  
age with haemophilia (FVIII:C ≤ 2%). Data from  patients having participated in pre - 
authorisation studies with Nuwiq® and data from patients starting treatment with  
Nuwiq® in additional clinical Good Clinical Practice (GCP) studies may be combined  
with data from  patients  agreeing  to participate in thi s non-interventional study  to 
count towards the required 200 patients (see Section 7.5.2 ). Patients from pre - 
authorisation studies can be followed up to at least [ADDRESS_1147444] 100 EDs.  
• Of the [ADDRESS_1147445]  severe  haemophilia  A 
(FVIII:C  < 1%).  
• Because the results of a clinical study in children was evaluated as part of the  
marketing  authorisation  procedure,  patients  of every  age group  are eligible  to be 
included  in this study.  The age distribution  of enrolled  patients  should  be evenly

balanced. Thus, of the 200 enrolled patients, approx. 60 patients should be < [ADDRESS_1147446] 10  patients  should be  aged  between  14–18 years . 
• Patients  with severe  haemophilia  A after successful  immune  tolerance  inducti on (ITI)  
can also be included;  the proportion  of these  ITI patients  should not  exceed  25% of 
the entire  cohort.  
 
5.1 Inclusion  Criteria

Nuwiq® is formulated as a powder and solvent for solution for injection. Each vial of  
Nuwiq® contains either 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000 and 4000international units (IU)  
of freeze -dried simoctocog alfa concentrate, each to be reconstituted in 2.5 mL of sterilised  
water  for injections  (WFI).  Complete  product  information  is given  in the SPC of Nuwiq® . 
 
6.2 Packaging  
 
In this non-interventional  study,  commercially  available  Nuwiq®  will be used.  
Nuwiq® is filled and lyophilised in glass vials. The solvent for reconstitution of the drug  
product,  2.[ADDRESS_1147452]  vial is provided  with a kit containing:  
• One sterile  vial adapter  for reconstitution  
• One butterfly  needle  
• Two alcohol  swabs  
Only the provided injection sets should be used because treatment failure can occur as a  
consequence of human coagulation factor VIII adsorption to the internal surfaces of some  
injection  equipment.  
 
6.3 Conditions  for Storage  and Use 
 
Nuwiq® has a shelf life of 24 months at 2°C to 8°C. For further details on specific storage

6.5 Treatment  Regimen,  Dose,  and Dosin g Interval  
 
The treatment regimen (i.e., prophylactic treatment, on -demand treatment, ITI, or surgical  
prophylaxis) as well as the doses, dosing intervals, or dose adjustments will be determined  
at the discretion of the treating physician and should be recorded in the CRF. If deemed  
appropriate by [CONTACT_827105], options f or individual  
adjustment of the prophylaxis regimen may be calculated from the results of a PK  
assessment.  
 
Prophylactic  treatment  
For long-term prophylaxis  against  bleeding  in patients  with severe  haemophilia  A, the usual  
doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. In some  
cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be  
necessary.  For further  details please  refer  to your country  specific  package  insert.

6.7 Treatment  Compliance  
 
There will not be any specific procedures to monitor the patients’ compliance with  
treatment. Compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_827106]  (see Section  7.4). 
The treating physician should promote compliance by [CONTACT_786955] (or the  
patient’s parent or legal guardian) to administer Nuwiq® exactly as prescribed an d by 
[CONTACT_827107]’s safety. The patient should be  
asked  to contact  [CONTACT_827108],  for any reason,  to administer  Nuwiq®  
as prescribed.  
 
[ADDRESS_1147459]  
Patient eligibility for enrolment into the study will be determined at the Screening Visit,  
during  which demographic  and baseline  data will be recorded  (Table  2). 
Before patient inclusion, there should be no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n of FVIII inhibitors, and a  
recovery and inhibitor test in a central laboratory is recommended to confirm that the  
patient is negative at study entry. An inhibitor test which is not negative should be  
confirmed by [CONTACT_6310] a second separately drawn sample in central laboratory. The  
recommended testing schedule for FVIII inhibitors is predefined in Guideline  
EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  and is presented  in Table  3. 
An optional PK assessment to determine individualized or population based prophylactic  
treatment regimen of a patient may be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician.  
The dose and dosing interval will be calculated in the frame of this non -interventional study  
either based on an individual PK with 6 - 10 time points or a population PK with 1 - 3 time  
points  – (see Section 8.3 and Table  5). 
Treatment regimen of a patient may be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician.  
The individual dose and dosing interval will be calculated in the frame of this non - 
interventional  study.  
Patient diaries will be evaluated for the total number o f exposures per year and the mean  
dose per kg per patient/year (consumption). The intended treatment regimen for every  
patient  at study  entry  and the reason for  each ED will also  be documented.  
In case of bleeding, the particulars of the event will be docu mented, along with drug  
consumption  data and the severity  and treatment  outcome  assessed  by [CONTACT_827109].  
In case of surgery, details of the intervention will be collected, such as type of surgery  
(planned or emergency), mode of administration, drug consumption, and any complications  
that may occur.

and other safety information as defined below have to be documented and reported to  
Octapharma.  
8.2.1 Definition of (serious) adverse drug reaction and other safety information  
Adverse  drug reaction  (ADR)  
An ADR is a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended [Directive  
2001/83/EC  Art 1(11)].  
‘Response’ in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and  
an adverse  event  is at least a reasonable  possibility  (see Annex IV, ICH -E2A Guideline).  
ADRs may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing  
authorisation or from occupational exposure [Directive 2001/83/EC Art 101(1)]. Conditions  
of use outside the marketing authorisation include off -label use, overdose, misuse, abuse  
and medication errors.

Serious  adverse  drug  reaction  (SADR)  
SADRs  are ADRs  that fulfil  at least one of the following  criteria:  
• results  in death  
• is life -threatening (this implies that the patient was at risk of death at the time of the  
event; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if  
more  severe)  
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111224] -patient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111225] - 
patient  status)  
• results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• is a medically  important  event,  e.g., 
– suspected  transmission  via a medicinal  product  of an infectious  agent,  
– inhibitor  development,  
– thromboembolic  events,  or 
– other  reactions  that should  be reported  in an expedited  manner  although  they 
did not immediately result in one of the above seriousness criteria, e.g.,  
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic  
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_827091]  
 
8.2.2 Other  relevant  drug  safety  information  
Any safety  information  relating  to 
• drug abuse (persistent, sporadic or intentional excessive use of a medicinal product  
inconsistent  with the  SPC or acceptable  medical  practice),  
• misuse (situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately  
used not in  accordance  with the authorised product  information)  
• overdose (administration  of a quantity  of a medicinal  product  given  per 
administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose  
according  to the authorised  product  information.  Clinical  judgement  should  always  be 
applied.),  
• medication  errors  (prescribing  or dispensing  error),  
• interactions  with other  medicinal  products  or devices  
• occupational exposure (an exposure to a medicinal product as a result of one’s  
professional  or non-professional  occupation)  associated  with Human -cl rhFVIII , even  
if no ADR  occurred.  
Study  Protocol  
No. GENA -[ADDRESS_1147467], i.e., hypersensitivity reactions and FVIII inhibitor development  
(see Section 2.2.3 ) as well as thromboembolic events, will be specifically monitored  
throughout  the study  using  specific  CRF  pages.  
 
Hypersensitivity  reactions  
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are  
possible. Nuwiq® contains traces of human host cell proteins other than factor VIII. Early  
signs of hypersensitivity reactions include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the  
chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. A sample CRF for hypersensitivity  
reactions is provided in the Appendix 1: Case Safety Report Form,  Case Safety Report  
Form  - Annex  1: FVIII  Inhibitor  Development.  
 
FVIII  inhibitors  
The diagnosis of factor V III inhibitor will be based on clinical observations and be  
confirmed by [CONTACT_827117]. The recommended  
laboratory testing schedule is given in Table 3 . Items to be recorded include d etails on  
when blood samples were obtained for inhibitor testing and recovery tests (including dose),  
results of these tests and assay methodology, description of clinical symptoms suggesting  
inhibitor development, e.g. ineffective prophylaxis, need to inc rease dose and/or decrease  
prophylactic treatment interval, need to increase dose and/or number of infusions to treat a  
bleed. A sample CRF for FVIII inhibitor testing is provided in the Appendix 1: Case Safety  
Report Form,  Case Safety Report Form - Annex 2: Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic  
Reactions . 
The occurrence of FVIII inhibitors is considered a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR).  
The sampling  time points  and inhibitor  levels  should  be recorded  and included  in the SADR  
report.  For SADR  reporting  requirements,  see Section 8.2.4 . 
 
Thromboembolic  events  
A sample CRF for thromboembolic events is provided in the Appendix 1: Case Safety  
Report  Form , Case  Safety  Report  Form  - Annex 3:  Thromboembolic  Events.

8.3 Optional  PK evaluation  
Individual dosing and dosing interval can be calcula ted at the beginning or during patients  
are on this study if deemed potentially beneficial by [CONTACT_1963]. The treating  
physician  can decide  whether  an individual  or population  approach  will be used to perform  
the PK analysis. For the PK evaluat ion the information listed in Table 5 should be  
collected.

before and at least 5 times after  
Nuwiq®  infusion  of a recommended  
dose  of 60±5  IU/kg.  
- The following  time points  are 
recommended:  
• Before  ( 30 min) infusion  of 
Nuwiq® 
• 30 minutes, 6, 24, 48 and 72  
hours  after infusion  of Nuwiq® 
• For a complete PK additionally  
1, 3, 9 and 30 hours after the  
infusion  are recommended.  - FVIII:C levels measured locally or  
centrally  (as applicable  per country)  at 
1 to 3 time points* (prior and) after  
infusion of Nuwiq®. Sampling time  
points can be combined from multiple  
infusions of Nuwiq® at a dose patient  
is routinely  treated with.  
- The following time points for the  
determination  of FVIII  plasma  levels  
are recommended:  
• 1-[ADDRESS_1147469] 12h apart  
between 4 -48h. Example: between 4 - 
8h (e.g. 6h), 16-28h (e.g. 24h†) and 
40-60h (e.g. 48h) § 
*inclusion  of a pre-infusion  sample  is recommended.  
†24h is the sample  providing  the most  information.  
§ If patient  is known  to have  a longer  half-life with Nuwiq®,  a sample  between  60 and 84h 
is recommended (e.g. 72h).  
 
- FVIII:C levels measured after infusion of Nuwiq® up to 6 months prior to  
enrolment in the study are acceptable to perform the PK analysis, if no significant  
changes  in patient’s health or  weight  have  been recorded .  
 
- Patients  must  consent  to this optional  assessment.  
 
- Patients  should  be preferably  not bleeding  at the time of blood  sampling  for PK.

8.4 Laboratory  Assessments  
 
8.4.1 General  Laboratory  Assessments  
General laboratory assessments, such as FVIII:C measurements in case of surgery will be  
done  by [CONTACT_827118] . 
FVIII:C  measurement  for PK analysis  will be done  either  at local  laboratories  or central  
laboratory  as applicable per  specific  countries.  
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1147470] FVIII is a major complication of haemophilia A  
treatment. The risk of inhibitor occurrence is higher in patients with severe haemophilia A  
than in patients with moderate and mild disease, and the genotype (high risk: inversions,  
large deletions or nonsense mutations of the FVIII gene) and ethnic background of the  
patient  is also  of relevance.  
In addition, risk may be associated with commencing treatment in previously untreated  
patients,  when  changing  treatment,  or when  the antigenicity  of a product  has been  altered  
due to changes in the  manufacturing  process.  
Previously treated patients, the population to be enrolled into this study, are the most  
suitable candidates to test the product -related i mmunogenicity of a factor VIII product  
(Guideline  EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009).  
• According to Guideline EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009, there should not be any  
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_827092], and a recovery and  
inhibitor test in a central laboratory should confirm that the patient is inhibitor - 
negative  at study  entry.  
• In addition,  testing  should  be carried  out if there  is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_827093].  
• Inhibitor tests should be performed when the plasma factor VIII level has reached a  
pre-substitution  nadir  (documentation  for the last infusion  should  be provided).  
• Inhibitor re -testing using a second separately drawn sample as c onfirmatory  
measurement  should be  performed  in the central  laboratory.  
• The flow chart of inhibitor testing is as recommended by [CONTACT_827112]/CHMP/BPWP/144533/[ADDRESS_1147471]: 
Esoterix  Coagulation  
[ADDRESS_1147472] used  
Inhibitor activity will be determined by [CONTACT_301268] (Nijmegen  
modification).  
 
FVIII  inhibitor  status  definitions  
The FVIII  inhibitor  status  is defined  as follow:  
• Negative:  < 0.6 BU  
• Low-titre inhibitors:  < 5 BU 
• High -titre inhibitors:  ≥ 5 BU 
A rise in the circulating FVIII level of less than 1% per FVIII IU/kg administered will be  
considered an indication for inhibitor development. A rise of less than 1.5% per IU/kg  
administered  will be considered  suggestive  for inhibitor  development.  
The flow chart of FVIII inhibitor testing as recommended by [CONTACT_827112]/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009  is given  in Table  3. 
The occurrence of FVIII inhibitors is considered a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR).  
The sampling  time points  and inhibitor  levels  should  be recorded  and included  in the SADR  
report.  For SADR  reporting  requirements,  see Section 8.2.4 . 
 
9 DATA  MANAGEMENT  
 
9.1 Documentation  of Data  
 
For each patient enrolled, a Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed and approved by  
[CONTACT_827119]. Study site staff will be responsible for  
entering  all patient data  into the  CRF.  
If any errors in the CRFs are found  during the data review process, queries will be  
generated by [CONTACT_5640] a monitor or Data Management and submitted to the site personnel or  
monitor. Once the query has been answered, Data Management or the monitor will review  
the new or changed  data to  ensure  an appropriate  response  and close  the query.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1147473], the treating  
physician will supply the Sponsor with additional data relating to the study, ensuring that  
the pa tient’s confidentiality is maintained. This is particularly important when errors in data  
transcription  are encountered. In  case of particular  issues or  queries  by [CONTACT_827120]. GENA -[ADDRESS_1147474] access to the complete study records, provided that  
the patient’s  confidentiality  is protected  in accordance  with applicable  regulations.

10.2 Analysis  Plan  
 
The data recorded  in the CRF  will be analysed  using  descriptive  statistical  methods.  An 
analysis plan detailing the analyses to be performed will be prepared by [CONTACT_827121].  
 
10.3 Progress  Study  Reports  
 
A progress study report will be prepared 2 years after marketing authorisati on, detailing the  
recruitment  status  and progress of  the study.  
 
10.4 Optional  PK evaluation  
 
Individual  PKs will be assessed  based  on the availability  of individual  patient  data using  
either a 1 - or 2-compartment model or the WAPPS -Hemo (Web -Accessible Population  
Pharmacokinetics Service Hemophilia) model. Based on the estimated PK parameters,  
potential treatment options will be calculated. The calculated PK parameters will be  
analysed  descriptively.

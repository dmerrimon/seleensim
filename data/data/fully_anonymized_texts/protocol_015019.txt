Study Design Overview
This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX (Treatment Ar m A) versus BTZ + LD-DEX (Treatment Arm 
B) in subjects with relapsed or refractory MM. 
For Treatment Arm A (POM + BTZ + DEX), the dose was based on the results from the CC-
4047-MM-005 (MM-005) Phase 1 dose escalation MTD study in which bortezomib was 
administered via IV infusion.  In the MM-005 study, the maximum planned dose (MPD), POM (4 mg) + IV BTZ (1.3 mg /m
2) and DEX (20 mg subjects ≤ 75 years old/10 mg subjects > 75 
years old) was reached without any DLTs. Considering an early POM single agent MTD study

Confidential and Propri etary 7 Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 5 Final: 14 Jun 2017(Richardson, 2013 ) as well as the findings in MM-005, the MPD was determined to be the 
optimal dose for the triple combination therapy.  With the optimal dose determined, MM-007 
was initiated using the MPD dose for the combination of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX (with IV 
BTZ).
During the conduct of the MM -005 study, subcutaneous (SQ) BTZ was approved as an 
alternative administration method for BTZ (23 Jan 2013).  The SQ BTZ was reported to have a 
decreased incidence of neurotoxicity versus the IV BTZ ( Velcade®Prescribing Information, 
2014).  To explore the SQ route of BTZ administration in combination with POM and DEX, the 
MM-005 protocol was amended to add a cohort of 6 subjects at the MPD/optimal dose for the 
combination of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX with BTZ administered via SQ injection.  Based on the safety, efficacy and PK data for this SQ BTZ cohort (see Section 1.4) and general adoption in 
medical practice of SQ BTZ as standard of car e due to decreased neurotoxicity, BTZ 
administration is now to be SQ for both arms in the MM-007 study (Treatment Arm A and B).
Subjects who consented to the original MM-007 protocol can continue with IV BTZ or switch to 
SQ BTZ at the discretion of the treating physician.  Subjects randomized into MM-007 under IV 
BTZ treatment will not be replaced.
Approximately 544 subjects will be randomized equally (1:1 ratio) into the two treatment arms 
(272 subjects in each arm).
Based on the primary endpoint progression-free survival (PFS), at 2-sided significance level of 
5%, with one interim analysis for futility only,  an estimated total of 381 progression/death events 
are required to detect a 33% increase in median PFS in the POM treatment arm (Arm A; median = 12 months) compared to that in the compar ator arm (Arm B; median = 9 months) with 80% 
power. In order to obtain PFS events from approximately 70% of the study  ITT population for 
the final PFS analysis, a total of [ADDRESS_819587] when approximately 50% PFS information (191 events) has occurred. The interim results will be examined for fut ility only with the pre-sp ecified type II 
error spending functions described in Section 10.9.
Celgene amended the protocol in Amendment 5 to  perform the final PFS analysis earlier than 
originally planned (381 PFS events).  Recently published data from a number of Phase 3 studies 
revealed that the PFS of the bortezomib with low-dose dexamethasone (BTZ+LD-DEX) arm on 
this study CC-4047-MM-007 (OPTIMISMM), that requires prior treatment with lenalidomide as per Protocol Inclusion Criteria #7 (Section 7.2), is expected to be shorter than the original 
OPTIMISMM protocol s tatistical assu mption of 9 months (relevant median PFS data from Phase
3 ENDEAVOR, PANORAMA-1, and CASTOR studies ranging from 7 to 8 months) ( Moreau, 
2017; Palumbo, 2016; San-Miguel, 2014 ).
Subsequently, if the assumption for the pom alidomide, bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone 
(POM+BTZ+LD-DEX) arm and other study a ssumptions remain unchanged, the number of PFS 
events required for the final analysis would be less than originally planned. The data cutoff date 
for the revised final PFS analysis will be October 2017, by [CONTACT_617187] 320 PFS 
events are projected to be reached, representing an approximate 57% event rate (out of 559 randomized subjects). This would allow for 80% power to test a median PFS of [ADDRESS_819588] ratio of 0.73.

Confidential and Propri etary 8 Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 5 Final: 14 Jun 2017Overall survival (OS) will be tested if PFS a nd overall response rate (ORR) results are 
significant (see Section 10.10 ). With one planned interim analysis OS at the time of the final PFS 
analysis (estimated to be at approximately 50% OS information [190 deaths]), at a 2-sided 
significance level of 5%, a total of [ADDRESS_819589] a 33% increase in median 
OS in Treatment Arm A (40 months) compared with Treatment Arm B (30 months) with 75% 
power. 
The OS assumption for the control arm (Treatment Arm B) are based  on the published results of 
SUMMIT and APEX trials in relapsed MM treated with bortezomib ( Richardson, 2003; 
Richardson, 2007c ).  Considering that LD-DEX will be gi ven in combination with BTZ in this 
study (as opposed to the SUMMIT trial where LD-D EX was added later on to subjects under 
BTZ single agent therapy with suboptimal response) as well as published observational data of 
OS in patients receiving combination therapy of BTZ plus DEX ( Ionita, 2009 ), the estimated 
median OS in the control arm (Treatment Arm B) using BTZ plus LD-DEX is 30 months. This is 
also supported by [CONTACT_617188]-1 studies, where the 
OS ranged from 24.3 to 35.8 months ( Moreau, 2017; San-Miguel, 2014 ). 
Except for pregnancy test and urinalysis, all la boratory assessments will be performed centrally; 
however, tests that may result in dose interruption and/or modification should also be performed locally to allow for treatment related decisions during subject visits.  All a bnormal results from 
local laboratories used in treatment decisions or adverse event reporting must be entered into an 
unscheduled visit on the eCRF. An Independent Response Adjudication Co mmit tee (IRAC) will 
be set up for this trial to review efficacy data in a blinded manner. The IRAC will determine the tumor response to therapy and to confirm the time of disease progression (PD) (if disease 
progressed) at scheduled or unscheduled visits for each subject. 
The safety and efficacy of the study will be  monitored by [CONTACT_617189] (IDMC) who are not involved in the trial conduct. The IDMC will meet up and 
review unblinded trial data at pre-specified intervals throughout the trial.  At time of the interim 
analysis, the IDMC will review the study data for futility assessment. In addition to the IDMC 
review, safety data will be monitored by [CONTACT_3433] e Celgene Medical Monitor and Safety Physician on 
an ongoing basis throughout the study. In the event when a significant safety issue is identified, 
the IDMC will be convened to make a recommendation as to the future conduct of the study.
The study will be conducted globally.
Screening
Potential study subjects will sign an informed consent prior to undergoing any study-related 
procedure.  Subjects need to complete screening for protocol eligibility within [ADDRESS_819590] udy conducted at selected clinical sites (where 
operationally and logistically feasible).  If a s ubject chooses to participate in the biomarker study, 
he/she must give consent for the optional biomarker study.
Subjects must have discontinued anti-myeloma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_140922] 14 days prior to randomization
(wash-out period). Subjects with myeloma-associated bone lesion may receive bisphosphonate therapy prior to study entry, unless such therapy is contraindicated.

Randomization
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized to either Treatment Arm A (POM 
+ BTZ + LD-DEX) or Treatment Arm B (BTZ + LD-DEX) with equal probability (1:1 
randomization ratio).
 
 The 
randomizatio n procedure will be accomplished by a validated IVRS/IWRS, stratified by [CONTACT_260512]: 1) age ( ≤ 75 years old vs. > 75 years old); 2) number of prior anti-MM 
regimens (1 vs. >1); 3) Beta-2 microglobulin ( β2M) at screening (< 3.5 mg/L vs. ≥ 3.5 mg/L - ≤ 
5.5 mg/L vs. > 5.5 mg/L). A rando mization aut horization number is needed to initiate the 
IVRS/IWRS prior to subject enrollment.
Study Treatment Phase
Study treatment for each subject begins on the same day as, or within 4 days following 
randomization.  Study visits with serial measurements of safety and efficacy will be performed 
as outlined in Table 1 , Table of Events.
 
  
 
Tumor response, including progressive disease (PD), will be assessed according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria (Durie, 2006 ); an 
exploratory assessment of response using the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) ( Bladé, 1998 ) response criteria will also be performed. All treatment 
decisions will be made by [CONTACT_617190]. 
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_819592] a prior history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism 
(PE).  At the discretion of the treating physician, other Treatment Arm B subjects may also receive antithrombotic therapy.  Subjects w ho develop symptomatic DVT under study tr eatment

Radiation therapy to a pathological fracture si te or to treat bone pain is permitted throughout the 
study. 
The use of hematopoietic growth factors is permitted (the use of myeloid growth factors is 
encouraged when the absolute neutrophil count is less than 1,000/ μL) at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  Platelet and red blood cell transfusions are also permitted during the study.  
However, subjects who fail absolute neutrophil count (ANC), hemoglobin or pl atelet eligibility 
criteria at screening CANNOT be re-tested for the study after being treated with growth factors or platelet/bl ood transfusion. However, sub jects who meet the ANC, hemoglobin and platelet 
eligibility criteria due to growth factor treatment  or platelet/blood transfusion received prior to 
screening are acceptable and are not considered as screening failures.
Drugs known to prolong QT corrected (QTc) interval should be avoided unless deemed 
medically necessary. See Appendix G for link to a comprehensive list of drugs which are known 
to prolong QTc.  A thorough QT study (CC-4047-CP-010) was conducted in healthy subjects according to the E14 Guidance to assess the potential of pomalidomide (POM) to delay cardiac re-polarization, esp ecially as prolongation of the QT interval.  The result of the QT prolongation 
assessment was observed to be negative, indicating a low risk of POM-associated QT prolongation.
Study Treatment Discontinuation 
Subjects will continue study treatment until PD or unacceptable toxicity.  An active treatment 
discontinuation visit should occur for all subjects at the time of permanent discontinuation from study treatment.  The reason for discontinuation from study treatment will be documented in the
electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) for all subjects. 
Progression-free Survival follow-up Phase
To ensure accuracy and completeness for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment of 
progression-free survival, subjects who permanently discontinued study treatment prior to PD 
will continue to be followed up in the PFS follow-up phase until PD. During this PFS follow-up period, efficacy assessments for response and PD per the IMWG uniform response criteria will 
be performed every 21 days (see Table 1 , Table of Events). Subjects are not expected to start any 
other anti-myeloma therapy during the PFS follow-up phase prior to PD.  Subjects are expected
to have a visit at the time of discontinuation from the PFS follow-up period.
Long-term Follow-up Phase
All subjects will be followed in the long-term fo llow-up phase until death or for at least [ADDRESS_819593] is randomized into the study, or longer if clinically indicated (unless the 
follow-up is shorter due to withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or death).  Long-term 
follow-up will occur 4 times per year (every 3 months) after the [ADDRESS_819594] treatment discontinuation visit or PFS follow-up phase discontinuation visit, as applicable.  During long-
term follow-up the following information will be collected: survival, subsequent anti-myeloma 
regimens, date of progression and reason for progression based on the IMWG uniform response criteria, if available, for subjects who did not have PD during the study  treatment or PFS follow-
up period, and second primary malignancies (SPM).

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare and incurab le progressive neoplastic disease that accounts for 
10% of all hematological malignancies.  It was estimated in 2010 that 20,180 new cases and 
10,650 deaths from the disease occurred in the [LOCATION_002] (US) ( Jemal, 2010 ). 
Significant progress has been made in the treatment of newly diagnosed MM with different 
combinations of melphalan, prednisone, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, thalidomide, lenalidomide
and proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) or autologous stem cell transplant following high-dose 
chemotherapy in appropriate patients (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [ NCCN]
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for MM, 2012; Child, 2003; Fermand, 2005 ). In recent 
years, innovative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_617155] ( Kumar, 2008). However, the disease follows a 
relapsing course in the majority of patients, regardless of treatment regimen or initial response to 
treatment.  MM remains incurable using convention al treatments, with median survival duration 
of approximately 5 years ( Richardson, 2007a ).  Therefore, there is a need for more effective 
therapeutic options for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
1.1. Treatment Options for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The treatment options approved for use in relapsed and/or refractory MM currently include:
Panobinostat:  Panobinostat in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, is indicated 
for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 2 prior regimens 
including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent.
Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone: Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the 
treatment of patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy ( Revlimid
Prescribing Information 2013 ).
Bortezomib:  Bortezomib monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed MM
(Velcade®Prescribing Information, 2014).
Pegylated doxorubicin-liposomal plus bortezomib: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) 
in combination with bortezomib for the treatment of patients with MM who have not previously 
received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy ( Velcade®Prescribing 
Information, 2014 ).
Carfilzomib:   Carfilzomib for the tr eatment of multiple myeloma in patients who have received 
at least [ADDRESS_819609] therapy 
(Kyprolis®Prescribing Information, 2012 ).
Pomalidomide plus dexamethasone:   Pomalidomide is a thalidomide analogue indicated, in 
combination with dexamethasone, for patients with multiple myeloma who have at least two prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_617156] a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on or within [ADDRESS_819610] therapy ( Pomalyst
®/ Imnovid®
Prescribing Information, 2015 ).
Other options that may be considered for salvage therapy in MM patients include thalidomide alone or in combination with dexamethasone or other agents, lenalidomide monotherapy,

Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 22 Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 5 Final: 14 Jun 2017lenalidomide in combination with bor tezomib and dexamethasone, or lenalidomide or 
bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone ( NCCN Clinical Practice 
Guidelines in Oncology for Multiple Myeloma, 2012 ).
The main considerations for choosing an appropriate treatment for relapsed MM are: risk level, 
prior therapy, duration of response to prior ther apy, residual toxicity, age, physical condition, and 
whether or not the patient is a candid ate for allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( NCCN Clinical 
Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Multiple Myeloma, 2012 ; Kastritis, 2009 ).
1.2. Bortezomib in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Bortezomib (Velcade®) was approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory MM based on 
the results of a Phase 3 trial (APEX Trial) comparing bortezomib to high dose dexamethasone as salvage therapy.  In an updated efficacy analysis of the APEX trial, the response rate was 43% with bortezomib vs. 18% for dexamethasone and the overall survival (OS) was 30 months with 
bortezomib vs. 23.7 months with dexamethasone ( Richardson, 2007c ).
The benefits of the adding dexamethasone to bortezomib therapy were shown in the SUMMIT 
trial in which 202 relapsed or refractory MM subjects were enrolled ( Richardson, 2003 ).  In this 
phase 2 study, patients received 1.3 mg/m
2of bortezomib for up to eight cycles.  In patients with 
a suboptimal response, oral dexamethasone (20 mg daily, on the day of and the day after 
bortezomib administration) was added to the regimen.  Seventy-eight patients who had either 
stable or progressive disease (PD) while receiving bortezomib alone subsequently received 
dexamethasone in combination with bortezomib.  Of  these 78, a total of 74 patients could be 
evaluated for a response to this combination, and 13 of these patients (18 percent) had a minimal 
or partial response. In 6 of these 13 patients, th e disease had previously been refractory to 
corticosteroid therapy.  Bortezomib in combin ation with dexamethasone is therefore included in 
the NCCN clinical practice guidelines as a category 2A recommendation for salvage therapy in MM patients ( NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for MM, 2012 ).
The approval of Doxil
®(doxorubicin HCl) in combination with bortezomib has led to more 
treatment options for relapsed or refractory MM.  The approval of this regimen was based on a Phase 3 study in 646 patients showing a signif icant increase in median time to disease
progression in Doxil plus bortezomib arm compar ed to bortezomib monotherapy arm (9.3 vs. 6.5 
months, respectively).  Starting from the 2010 NCCN clinical practice guidelines for Multiple Myeloma, this combination was recommended as  superior over bortezomib monotherapy for 
relapsed / refractory MM.  However, no data were submitted in support of the effectiveness of 
this combination treatment in patients who had received bortezomib previously ( Orlowski,
2007).
Recently published data from a number of Phase 3 studies has revealed that the progression free 
survival (PFS) of the bortezomib with dexamethasone (BTZ+LD-DEX) arm on this study CC-
4047-MM-007 (OPTIMISMM), that requires prior treatm ent with lenalidomide as per protocol 
Inclusion Criteria #7 (Section 7.2), is expected to be shorter than the original OPTIMISMM 
Protocol statistical assumption of 9 months (relevant median PFS data from Phase 3ENDEAVOR, PANORAMA-1 and CASTOR studies ranging from 7 to 8 months) ( Moreau, 
2017; Palumbo, 2016; San Miguel 2014).

The total system exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC last) was shown to be similar 
following IV or SQ administration of BTZ.  In addition, findings from an open-label, 
randomized, phase 3 non-inferiority study compari ng the efficacy and safety of SQ versus IV 
administration of bortezomib supported the substitution of SQ administration for IV with a 
similar efficacy and safety profile and a decreased incidence of peripheral neuropathy (Velcade®
Prescribing Information, 2014).
1.3. Pomalidomide (CC-4047)
Pomalidomide (CC-4047, 4- amino-2- (2,6-dioxopi[INVESTIGATOR_66808]-3-yl)isoindoline-1,3-dione) is a novel 
immunomodulatory drug under development for the treatment of MM.  Pomalidomide was first 
approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) on [ADDRESS_819611]®, and most recently has received full approval for the comb ination of pomalidomide with dexamethasone on 
23 Apr 2015. Pomalidomide was approved in the European Union (EU) (Imnovid®, originally Pomalidomide Celgene®) on 05 Aug 2013 through the centralized authorization procedure.  Pomalidomide shares a number of the beneficial pharmacologic properties of thalidomide and 
lenalidomide.  An in vitro model of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity has shown that 
pomalidomide has an IC
50of approximately 0.013 μM (13 nM) against TNF produced by 
[CONTACT_303921] (LPS)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).  
Thalidomide and lenalidomide, by [CONTACT_2163], have an IC 50of ~194 μM and 0.10 μM (100 nM), 
respectively ( Corral, 1999; Muller, 1999 ).  In LPS-stimulated human whole blood, IC 50for 
pomalidomide is 0.025 μ M (25 nM) ( Muller, 1999 ).  In addition, pomalidomide has 
demonstrated a 10-fold higher potency for T cell co-stimulation than lenalidomide (Corral 1999, 
Teo 2005 ).  Pomalidomide also augmented the activity of  natural killer (NK) cells and enhanced 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of targeted tumor cells in combination with therapeutic antibodies to tumor-specific surface antigens ( Hayashi, 2005; Hernandez-
Ilizaturri, 2005 ).  Moreover, pomalidomide is also a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of MM 
cell lines in vitro.  Concentrations of 2.73 to 27.3 ng/mL (0.01 to 0.1 μM) achieved a 50% 
inhibition of MM.1S and Hs Sultan cell proliferation.  In contrast, at concentrations of 25.8 
μg/mL (100 μM), thalidomid e inhibited the proliferation of MM.1S and Hs Sultan cells by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 
15% and 20%, respectively.  Pomalidomide is also more potent than thalidomide or lenalidomide 
in inducing G1 growth arrest and apoptosis in MM cell lines and in patient MM cells that are 
resistant to melphalan, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone as well as in enhancing the anti-MM activity of dexamethasone ( Hideshima, 2000 ).  However, pomalidomide does not inhibit the 
proliferation of normal B cells but rather protects them from apoptosis, suggesting an additive property of this compound in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_617157] ( Verhelle, 
2007).
Of potential relevance to the refractory MM setting, pomalidomide appears to retain anti-
proliferative activity against H929 and KMS-12-BM MM cells that have increased resistance to 
acute lenalidomide treatment following chronic exposure to lenalidomide ( Adams, 2009; 
Rychak, 2011).  Pomalidomide and dexamethasone were  also synergistic at inhibition of cell 
proliferation in lenalidomide-resistant cell lines.  Preliminary results from an in vitro experiment performed by [CONTACT_617195] ( Adams, 2009; Rychak, 2011 ) demonstrate that MM 
cells treated long-term with lenalidomide plus  dexamethasone and with pomalidomide plus

pomalidomide/dexamethasone.  This suggests that the combination of pomalidomide plus 
dexamethasone may be useful in the treatment of MM that is refractory to lenalidomide plus 
dexamethasone. Experience with Pomalidomide in Relapsed and/or Refractory MM
The clinical experience with pomalidomide in relap sed and/or refractory MM is limited to 2 
Celgene-sponsored trials and 2 investigator-initiated trials. Celgene Phase 1b Study (CDC-407-00-001 / CC-4047-MM-001; Completed): This was a 
phase 1b single-center, ascending dose (1, 2, 5, and 10 mg), open-label study to identify the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide given 
continuously (cohort 1; Schey, 2004 ) or on alternate days (cohort 2; Streetly, 2008 ) in [ADDRESS_819612] two cycles of 
treatment or who relapsed after previous treatment.   The MTD was 2 mg continuously and 5 mg 
on alternate days; the most common dose limiting t oxicity (DLT) was grade [ADDRESS_819613] common AEs were neutropenia, throm bocytopenia, pharyngitis, cough, dyspnea, and 
hypoesthesia.  Overall, 23 (51%) of 45 subjects had PR or better, including 6 CR and 12 VGPR.  In cohort 1, the progression free survival (PFS) was 9.75 months and OS was 22.5 months; in cohort 2, the PFS was 10.5 months and OS was 35.9 months.
Celgene Phase 1b/2 Study (CC-4047-MM-002; Enrollment completed): This was a phase 
1b/2 multicenter, randomized, open-label, dose es calation (2, 3, 4, and 5 mg) study to evaluate 
the MTD of pomalidomide alone (Phase 1) and the safety and efficacy of pomalidomide alone 
using a cyclic regimen (21 of 28 days) and in combination with low-dose dexamethasone (Phase 
2) using a cyclic regimen (21 of 28 days) in subjects with relapsed and refractory MM who had received ≥ [ADDRESS_819614] rate in the 5 mg cohort. A total of 221 subjects were enrolled in 
phase 2 (POM+LD-DEX n = 113; POM n = 108); 219 received ≥ 1 cycle of study treatment and 
191 subjects were evaluable for response. Baseline characteristics were co mparable between the 
two arms with a median of 5 (range 2–13) prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_617158]; 74% of subjects in POM+LD-DEX and 76% of subjects in POM alone had prior autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). The rem aining subjects were elderly (aged > 75 yrs) or ineligible for 
ASCT; all subjects were exposed to corticosteroids and 84% in the POM+LD-DEX and 95% in POM alone arms were exposed to alkylators. Subjects were refractory to LEN (POM+LD-DEX 77% and POM alone 79%), BTZ (73% and 69%), or both drugs (61% and 59%). Among 
subjects who were randomized to receive POM alone, 61 (56%) subsequently went on to receive 
POM+LD-DEX due to progressive disease (PD) per protocol. A median of 5 (range 1–17) treatment cycles were received by [CONTACT_617196]. Median treatment duration was 5.0 mos.  
Response of ≥ PR was seen in 34% of subjects in the POM+LD-DEX arm and 13% in the POM 
alone arm, including 1% complete response (CR) in each arm; ≥ MR was 45% vs. 29%, 
respectively. Median DOR was 7.7 months with POM+LD-DEX and 8.3 months with POM alone, and median PFS was 4.6 and 2.6 months, respectively. Median OS was comparable for 
both arms (14.4 and 13.6 months). Results from independent adjudication were similar, with ≥ 
PR in 30% of subjects in the POM+LD-DEX arm and 9% in the POM alone arm, including 1% 
and 0% CR, respectively, in each arm. ≥ MR was achieved with POM+LD-DEX in 45% and

POM+LD-DEX or POM alone, respectively, achieved ≥ PR; ≥  MR was 45% and 30%, 
respectively. Median PFS was 3.8 months for POM+LD-DEX and 2.0 months for POM alone; 
median OS showed a similar trend (13.5 and 10.8 months, respectively). The main reason for 
treatment discontinuation was PD in bot h arms (POM+LD-DEX 51%; POM alone 44%); 
discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were 7% and 12%, respectively. Grade 3/4 AEs in 
POM+LD-DEX vs. POM alone, respectively, were: neutropenia 38% and 47%; febrile 
neutropenia 2% and 2%; thrombocytopenia 19% and 21%; anemia 21% and 17%; pneumonia 
19% and 8%; and fatigue 10% and 8%. All grades of peripheral neuropathy, deep vein thrombosis, and renal failure occurred in 7% and 10%, 2% and 1%, and 2% and 1% of subjects 
for POM+LD-DEX vs. POM alone, respectively ( Richardson, 2011a ).
Investigator Initiated Phase 2 Study at the Mayo Clinic (PO-MM-PI-0010; Enrollment 
completed): This is a phase 2 open-label study of pomalidomide (2 mg continuous) plus low-
dose dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
MM who had received 1-3 prior regimens ( Lacy, 2009a ).  A total of 60 subjects were initially 
enrolled into this study.  Thirty-eight (63%) of the 60 subjects had confirmed response including 
3 CR and 17 VGPR.  Responses were seen in 8 of 12 (66.7%) lenalidomide-refractory subjects, 6 
of 16 (37%) thalidomide-refractory subjects, and 6 of 10 (60%) bortezomib refractory subjects. The most common Grade 3/[ADDRESS_819615] common 
non-hematological Grade 3/4 toxicities were fatigue and pneumonia. 
Since responses were observed in some patients who were refractory to lenalidomide in the 
initial cohort of 60 subjects, an additional cohort of 34 subjects, who were refractory to prior 
lenalidomide therapy, was enrolled from November 2008 to April 2009.  The overall response 
rate (≥PR) was 32% for this cohort of [ADDRESS_819616] common Grade 3/4 hematologic 
toxicity was neutropenia (29%) and the most common Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity was 
fatigue (9%), which was consistent with that observed in the initial cohort of 60 subjects ( Lacy, 
2010b ).
Based on experience of Richardson, et al ( Richardson, 2009a ) where the MTD of pomalidomide 
was determined to be 4 mg, a phase 2 study was initiated by [INVESTIGATOR_288679], et al to compare the two 
different dosing regimens in MM subjects who were refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib.  Pomalidomide was given orally 2 mg/day or 4 mg/day, on Days 1 to 28 of a 28-day 
cycle, with dexamethasone 40 mg daily on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22.  A total of 70 subjects were 
enrolled (35 in the 2 mg cohort and 35 in the 4 mg cohort).  The most common Grade 3/[ADDRESS_819617] common non-hematologic toxicity was 
fatigue.  The overall response rate ( ≥ PR) was 25% and 29% for the 2 mg and 4 mg cohorts,
respectively ( Lacy, 2010c ).

response) and 3 subjects reached CR. The median  PFS was 6.3 (4.1-9.1) mont hs in either arm, 
and the median duration of response was 11.4 (3.7-13.6) months and 7.9 (4.0- not reached) months in Cohort A and in Cohort B, respectively. The median PFS was 4.2 (3.3-6.9) months for subjects with stable disease (SD) as compared to 12.6 (9.9-14.8) months in subjects that had a 
response.  The primary toxicity was myelosuppression and was similar in both treatment arms (Leleu, 2011a ).
The results of studies conducted thus far indicate that pomalidomide has activity in patients with 
relapsed and/or refractory MM, including patients who are refractory to lenalidomide and 
bortezomib. Confirmed response rates range between 30% and 60% at pomalidomide doses of between 2 and 4 mg/day in co mbination with dexamethasone.  Notably, pomalidomide produces 
responses in subjects who are refractory to lenalidomide, another IMiDs
®compound, aligning 
with the non-clinical results observed in lenalidomide-resistant cells ( Adams, 2009 ; Rychak, 
2011).  The most common hematological toxicity experienced by [CONTACT_617198] 
(non-febrile), which can be managed by [CONTACT_617199].  The most common

1.4. Experience with IMiDs®in Combination with Bortezomib in 
Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
1.4.1. Pre-clinical 
Preclinical studies have shown that both thalidomide and lenalidomide potentiate the activity of 
bortezomib in combination of dexamethasone ( Mitsiades, 2002; Hideshima, 2000 ).  
Lenalidomide and dexamethasone have been shown to trigger myeloma cell apoptosis via caspase-[ADDRESS_819618] of nuclear factor–kappa B (NF- κB) on the antimyeloma 
activity of dexamethasone. These molecular events potentiate the induction of a dual caspase-8 and caspase-9–mediated apoptotic cascade with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, leading to enhanced antimyeloma activity.
1.4.2. Clinical 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lenalidomide and Bortezomib
The combination of an immune modulator (lenalidomide) with bortezomib, has shown promising 
efficacy as frontline and salvage treatment in MM patients.  As frontline therapy, the combination of lenalidomide (25 mg), bortezomib (1.3 mg/m
2), and low-dose dexamethasone
generated high response in a phase 1/2 study ( Richardson, 2010c ). This combination has also 
been shown to be well-tolerated and active in heavily pretreated relapsed / refractory MM

[IP_ADDRESS]. Pomalidomide With Bortezomib
In the Celgene-sponsored CC4047-MM-005 (MM-005) study, the dose escalation to determine 
the dose for the combination of POM+BTZ+DEX was performed using intravenous (IV) BTZ, 
as only the IV BTZ formulation was approved at the time the trial was initiated.  In the first 4 
cohorts of MM-005, the POM dose was escalated from 1 mg to 4 mg with the IV BTZ at 1mg/m
2, and in the last dose-escalation cohort the POM dose was 4 mg with IV BTZ at 1.3
mg/m2. An additional 7 subjects were enrolled into an expansion cohort to further confirm the 
safety and preliminary efficacy of the 4 mg POM + 1.3 mg/m2IV BTZ + LD-DEX dose.  The 
combination of POM+ IV BTZ+DEX was generally well tolerated in this RRMM population 
which had progressed on or within [ADDRESS_819620] common grade 3/4 toxicities we re neutropenia (36%) 
and thrombocytopenia (27%).  Promising activity in this population was also shown with an ORR of 71% and 38% ≥ VGPR ( Richardson, 2013a ).
Due to the approval of SQ BTZ with safety data showing a decreased incidence of peripheral 
neuropathy compared to IV BTZ ( Velcade
®Prescribing Information, 2014), the MM-005 
protocol was amended in April 2013 to include an additional cohort of 6 subjects to explore the 
combination of 4 mg POM + 1.3 mg/m2BTZ + LD-DEX with BTZ administered subcutaneously 
(SQ).  As of January 2014, all [ADDRESS_819621] each: insomnia, memory impairment, asthenia, fatigue, blood phosphorus

4.1. Study Design
This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and 
safety of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX (Treatment Ar m A) versus BTZ + LD-DEX (Treatment Arm 
B) in subjects with relapsed or refractory MM. 
For Treatment Arm A (POM + BTZ + DEX), the dose was based on the results from the CC-
4047-MM-005 (MM-005) Phase 1 dose escalation MTD study in which bortezomib was 
administered via IV infusion.  In the MM-005 study, the maximum planned dose (MPD), POM 
(4 mg) + IV BTZ (1.3 mg /m2) and DEX (20 mg subjects ≤ 75 years old/10 mg subjects > 75 
years old) was reached without any DLTs. Considering an early POM single agent MTD study 
(Richardson, 2013) as well as the findings in MM-005, the MPD was determined to be the 
optimal dose for the triple combination therapy.  With the optimal dose determined, MM-007 
was initiated using the MPD dose for the combination of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX (with IV 
BTZ).
During the conduct of the MM-005 study, subcutaneous (SQ) BTZ was approved as an 
alternative administration method for BTZ (23 Jan 2013).  The SQ BTZ was reported to have a 
decreased incidence of neurotoxicity versus the IV BTZ ( Velcade®Prescribing Information, 
2014).  To explore the SQ route of BTZ administration in combination with POM and DEX, the 
MM-005 protocol was amended to add a cohort of 6 subjects at the MPD/optimal dose for the 
combination of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX with BTZ administered via SQ injection.  Based on the 
safety, efficacy and PK data for this SQ BTZ cohort (see Section 1.4) and general adoption in 
medical practice of SQ BTZ as standard of care due to decreased neurotoxicity, BTZ 
administration is now to be SQ for both arms in the MM-007 study (Treatment Arm A and B).
Subjects consented to the original MM-007 protocol can continue with IV BTZ or switch to SQ 
BTZ at the discretion of the treating physician.  Subjects randomized into MM-007 under IV 
BTZ treatment will not be replaced.
Approximately 544 subjects will be randomized equally (1:1 ratio) into the two treatment arms 
(272 subjects in each arm).
An Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC) will be set up for this trial to review 
efficacy data in a blinded manner. The IRAC will determine the tumor response to therapy and to confirm the time of disease progression (PD) (if disease progressed) at scheduled or unscheduled 
visits for each subject. 
The safety and efficacy of the study will be  monitored by [CONTACT_617189] (IDMC) who are not involved in the trial conduct. The IDMC will meet up and 
review unblinded trial data at pre-specified intervals throughout the trial.  At the time of the 
interim analysis, the IDMC will review the study data for fu tility assessment. In addition to the 
IDMC review, safety data will be monitored by [CONTACT_617200]. In the event when a significant safety issue is identified, the IDMC will be convened to make a recommendation as to the future conduct of the study.
The study will be conducted in sites globally.

Study population
The study population includes r elapsed or refractory MM subjects with at least one but no more 
than three prior anti-myeloma treatment reg imens. APEX Trial, a Phase 3 trial that led to the 
approval of BTZ (Velcade
®) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory MM, also included a 
similar subject population with [ADDRESS_819624] received bortezomib-c ontaining prior anti-myeloma therapy may be 
included. However, as subjects may be receivi ng BTZ+LD-DEX treatment (Treatment Arm B), 
they must not have had PD during therapy or wi thin [ADDRESS_819625] dose of bortezomib-
containing therapy under the 1.3 mg/m2/dose twice weekly dosing schedule.
Comparator arm (bortezomib + low-dose dexamethasone)
Bortezomib (Velcade®) was approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory MM based on 
the results of a phase 3 trial (APEX Trial) comparing bortezomib to high dose dexamethasone as 
salvage therapy ( Richardson, 2005; Richardson, 2007 ). The addition of dexamethasone to 
bortezomib therapy was shown to add treatment benefit in the phase 2 SUMMIT Trial (Richardson, 2003; Richardson, 2006a ).  In a recent retrospective analysis, salvage therapy using 
dexamethasone in combination with bortezomib have demonstrated respectable PFS and OS 
outcomes in the MM patients received at least one prior therapy ( Ionita, 2009 ). 
In the recent update of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for MM, single agent 
bortezomib and bortezomib plus dexamethasone are Category 1 and Category 2A 
recommendations for MM salvage therapy, respectively ( NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in

Confidential and Propri etary 33 Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 5 Final: 14 Jun 2017Oncology for MM, 2012 v1 ). Considering the clinical evidence of bortezomib, and recent data of 
bortezomib plus dexamethasone, a treatment regimen of bortezomib in combination with low-
dose dexamethasone is consistent with the current  standard of care in this previously treated MM 
patient population.
Therefore, the choice of therapy for the comparat or arm in this study will be using bortezomib 
plus low-dose dexamethasone for this relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)
population.
Treatment arm (pomalidomide + bortezomib + low-dose dexamethasone)
Pre-clinical data have shown synergistic anti-myeloma activity between thalidomide/
lenalidomide and bortezomib ( Mitsiades, 2002; Hideshima, 2000 ).
The tolerability and promising activity of the combination of lenalidomide (an 
immunomodulator) and bortezomib (a proteasome-inhibitor) and dexamethasone have also been 
shown promising results in both the front-line and relapsed/refractory MM setting from Phase 1 
and Phase 2 clinical studies ( Richardson 2009a; Richardson 2010; Richardson 2010c ).
Pomalidomide is a potent immunomodulatory drug in the same class as lenalidomide /
thalidomide and has shown anti-myeloma activity in relapsed/refractory MM patients as a single agent and in combination with low-dose dexamethasone (see Section 1.3).
The results of clinical studies conducted thus far indicated that pomalidomide has activity in 
patients with relapsed/refractory MM, including patients whose disease has progressed after treatment with lenalidomide, bortezomib, or both. Confirmed overall response rate reached 47% 
in pomalidomide treated patients even at a dose of 2 mg/day ( Lacy, 2010c ).  Notably, 
pomalidomide produces respectable response rates in subjects who are refractory to 
lenalidomide, or both lenalidomide and bortezomib, aligning with the non-clinical results 
observed in lenalidomide-resistant cells ( Adams, 2009 ).
Based on the pre-clinical and clinical data, the addition of pomalidomide to bortezomib plus low-
dose dexamethasone could be a promising combin ation regimen in relapse d/refractory  MM, and 
therefore, is chosen to be further investigated in this Phase [ADDRESS_819626] is randomized into the study or longer if clinically indicated (unless the follow-up is shorter due to 
withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or death).
Dose
For Treatment Arm A (POM + BTZ + DEX), the dose was based on the results from the CC-
4047-MM-005 (MM-005) Phase 1 dose escalation MTD study in which bortezomib was 
administered via IV infusion.  In the MM- 005 study, the MPD, POM (4 mg) + IV BTZ (1.3 mg 
/m

combination therapy.  With the optimal dose determined, MM-007 was initiated using the MPD 
dose for the combination of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX (with IV BTZ).
During the conduct of the MM-005 study, subcutaneous (SQ) BTZ was approved as an

decreased incidence of neurotoxicity versus the IV BTZ ( Velcade®Prescribing Information,

MM-005 protocol was amended to add an additional cohort of 6 subjects at the MPD/optimal 
dose for the combination of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX with BTZ administered via SQ injection.  Based on the safety, efficacy and PK data for this SQ BTZ cohort (see Section 1.4) and general 
adoption in medical practice of SQ BTZ as standard of care due to decreased neurotoxicity, BTZ 
administration is now changed to SQ for both arms in the MM-007 study (Treatment Arm A and B).
For Treatment Arm B, the dose of BTZ will be the approved dose and schedule for relapsed or 
refractory MM ( Velcade
®Prescribing Information, 2014 ).
Subjects consented to the original MM-007 protocol can continue with IV BTZ or switch to SQ 
BTZ at the discretion of the treating physician.  Subjects randomized into MM-007 under IV 
BTZ treatment will not be replaced.
The DEX dose will be the same in both treatment arms.
Efficacy
Tumor response, including progressive disease (PD), w ill be assessed according to the IMWG 
uniform response criteria ( Durie, 2006 ); an exploratory assessment of response using the EBMT 
(Bladé, 1998 ) response criteria will also be performed. A ll treatment d ecisions will be made by 
[CONTACT_617203]. 
An IRAC will conduct blinded assessment for tumor response (including assessment of SD and 
of PD) incrementally during the study.  The IRAC adjudicated response data will be used for the
efficacy analysis of the study in all interim and final study reports.
To ensure consistency across centers, tumor response assessments will be based on lab reports 
from central laboratories in this study.
Exploratory Biomarkers
The following assessments will be explored in subjects at selected clinical sites (where 
operationally and logistically feasible) who consent to participate in the optional exploratory

MRD and Clonal Heterogeneity
The assessment of tumor response to therapy in MM has long been based on serum and/or urine 
electrophoresis and serum/urine immunofixations.  With recent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the CR rates have increased dramatically.  Currently, the most recent results using combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_617159] 30 to 50%. Many patients are expected to 
reach deeper response than CR. Assessment of Mi nimal Residual Disease would allow us to

Confidential and Propri etary 35 Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 5 Final: [ADDRESS_819627] that in tumor cells and T cells, cereblon, a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, is a target for binding by [CONTACT_210835]. These studies showed that the loss of cereblon
(CRBN) or a binding partner, such as DDB1, decreases or eliminates the anti-tumor and 
immunomodulatory activity of lenalidomide and pomalidomide respectively ( Ito, 2010; Zhu, 
2011; Lopez-Girona, 2012 ).  A number of recent studies have reported correlation between 
baseline (pre-treatment level of cereblon measured by [CONTACT_617204]) to clinical outcomes in subjects treated with regimens containing lenalidomide, pomalidomide or thalidomide. These studies have not used validated 
assays for the measurement of cereblon by [CONTACT_286288].  In addition, the measurement of 
cereblon (and other potential biomarkers) in the maintenance setting is an open scientific question. Thus, we would like to use validated assays for both gene expression and 
immunohistochemical methods and measure baseline and on treatment cereblon levels to 
investigate whether there is any potential correlation of cereblon level to clinical outcomes.  Recently, Aiolos and Ikaros have been identified as two substrates of CRBN. Together with 
CRBN, assessment of these proteins can also help us understand mechanistic as well as 
diagnostic aspect of the IMiD-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
In some subjects, we will also quantify subsets of immune cells and may assay their functions 
from whole blood samples (at baseline and during treatment) to explore whether and how during 
therapy, immune functions are modulated by [CONTACT_617205]. 
Genomic Biomarkers
Genomic translocations, mutations and chromos omal copy number alterations define myeloma at 
diagnosis and its natural history of progressi on. Therefore, understanding the molecular events 
through geno mic analysis would provide us with a deeper understanding of disease biology and 
its interaction with therapeutic interventions.  In this study we will employ multiple techniques to 
understand how the myeloma genomic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_617160].

Subjects with myeloma-associated bone lesion may receive bisphosphonate therapy prior to 
study entry, unless such therapy is contraindicated.
Subjects who failed screening as a result of neutropenia or anemia will not be permitted to use 
growth factors to become eligible.  
Subjects who failed screening will be permitted to be rescreened for eligibility.
Randomization
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized to either Treatment Arm A (POM 
+ BTZ + LD-DEX) or Treatment Arm B (BTZ + LD-DEX) with equal probability (1:1 
randomization ratio).
 
 The
central randomization procedure will be accomplished by a validated IVRS/IWRS, stratified by 
[CONTACT_617201]: 1) age ( ≤ 75 years old vs. > 75 years old); 2) number of prior anti-
myeloma regimens (1 vs. >1); 3) β2M at screening (< 3.5 mg/L vs. ≥ 3.5 mg/L - ≤ 5.5 mg/L vs. > 
5.5 mg/L).
Study Treatment Phase
Study treatment for each subject begins on the same day as or within 4 days following
randomization.  Study visits with serial measurements of safety and efficacy will be performed 
as outlined in Table 1 , Table of Events.
 
 
 
Tumor response, including progressive disease (PD), will be assessed according to the IMWG 
uniform response criteria ( Durie, 2006 ); an exploratory assessment of response using the EBMT 
(Bladé, 1998 ) response criteria will also be performed. All treatment decisions will be made by

who develop symptomatic DVT under study treatment will be assessed and diagnosed 
objectively by [CONTACT_617207] a comparable method.  Diagnostic algorithms will be 
provided in Appendix A .
Herpes Zoster Prophylaxis should be cons idered for all study subjects receiving bortezomib. Oral
acyclovir or equivalent antiviral therapy per institutional guidelines is acceptable for herpes zoster prophylaxis. 
During the study, subjects with myeloma-associated bone lesion may receive bisphosphonate 
therapy.
Radiation therapy to a pathological fracture si te or to treat bone pain is permitted throughout the 
study. 
The use of hematopoietic growth factors is permitted (the use of myeloid growth factors is 
encouraged when the absolute neutrophil count is less than 1,000/ μL) at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  Platelet and red blood cell transfusions are also permitted during the study.
However, subjects who fail absolute neutrophil count (ANC), hemoglobin or platelet eligibility 
criteria at screening CANNOT be re-tested for the study after being treated with growth factors 
or platelet/bl ood transfusion. However, sub jects who meet the ANC, hemoglobin and platelet 
eligibility criteria due to growth factor treatmen t or platelet/blood transfusion received prior to 
screening are acceptable and are not considered as screening failures.
Drugs known to prolong QT corrected (QTc) interval should be avoided unless deemed 
medically necessary. See Appendix G for link to a comprehensive list of drugs which are known 
to prolong QTc. A thorough QT study (CC-4047-CP-010) was conducted in healthy subjects 
according to the E14 Guidance to assess the potential of Pomalidomide (POM) to delay cardiac 
re-polarization, especially as prolongation of the QT interval.  The result of the QT prolongation 
assessment was observed to be negative, indicating a low risk of POM-associated QT prolongation.
Study Treatment Discontinuation
Subjects will continue study treatment until PD or unacceptable toxicity.  An active treatment
discontinuation visit should occur for all subjects at the time of permanent discontinuation from 
study treatment.  The reason for discontinu ation from study treatment w ill be documented in the 
eCRFs for all subjects.
Progression-free Survival (PFS) follow-up Phase
To ensure accuracy and completeness for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment of PFS, 
subjects who permanently discontinued study treatment prior to PD will continue to be followed up in the PFS follow-up phase until PD. During this PFS follow-up period, efficacy assessments 
for response and PD using the IMWG criter ia should be performed every 21 days (see Table 1,
Table of Events). Subjects are not expected to start any other anti-MM therapy during the PFS 
follow-up phase prior to PD.  Subjects are expected to have a visit at the time of discontinuation from the PFS follow-up period.

electrophoresis (quantified from the serum protein electrophoresis #sPEP∃test) and 
urine protein electrophoresis (quantified from the urine protein electrophoresis 
#uPEP∃test performed on 24-hour urine collection), will be performed at screening 
and at every cycle on Day 1, at treatment discontinuation, every 21 days during the 
PFS follow-up phase, at PFS follow-up phase discontinuation.  If a response or PD is 
noted based on sPEP and/or uPEP results, sPEP and uPEP tests should be repeated as 
soon as possible to confirm the response or PD.  Investigator evaluation of disease 
response should be based solely on the cen tral laboratory results, not on results from 
local laboratories.  In the event that results from the M-protein samples submitted to the central laboratory were not ob tained or not analyzable (tube broken, sample 
hemolyzed, etc.), an additional sample should be provided to the central laboratory 
immediately.
!Myeloma paraprotein (M-Proteins) immunofixation:  Serum and urine 
immunofixation (IFE) tests are performed at screening to identify the immunoglobulin subtype of MM and thereafter are triggered to be performed 
whenever M-protein is undetectable / too few to quantify in both sPEP and uPEPassays.
!Serum immunoglobulins assessment will be performed at screening and at every 
cycle on Day 1, at treatment discontinuati on, every 21 days during the PFS follow-up

Investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Japan will use commercially available bortezomib 
(Velcade®) for this study and will dispense this drug to subjects via prescription. The package 
insert should be consulted for handling, r econstitution, administrati on, and storage details.
For investigative sites outside of the United  States and Japan, bortezomib supplies will be 
provided as co mmercial material labeled appropriately as Investigational Product (IP) by

immediately after preparation. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior 
to use are the responsibility of the user. However, the chemical and physical in-use stability of 
the reconstituted solution has been demonstrated for 8 hours at 25°C stored in the original vial 
and/or a syringe. The total storage time for the reconstituted medicinal product should not exceed 
8 hours prior to administration.
As bortezomib 2.5 mg/ml reconstituted solution  for injection is to be administered

each subsequent treatment cycle in the treatment phase, starting on Day 1 of Cycle 2, and at the 
Treatment Discontinuation visit.  The investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting 
for all IP that is issued to and returned by [CONTACT_617233]. Any unused IP  must be returned by a study subject and 
retained by [CONTACT_617234] a Celgene representative (or designee). If any IP is lost or damaged, its disposition should be documented. At the periodic 
monitoring visits, a Celgene representative (or designee) will conduct IP accountability and address any discrepancies. Upon satisfactory reconciliation of all IP, returned IP may be 
destroyed. At the conclusion of the study, all  remaining study drug will be counted, reconciled 
with dispensing records, documented, and destroyed at the clinic site or allocated drug 
destruction location after completion of drug accountability by a Celgene representative (or 
designee). The Celgene representative (or designee) will ensure that a final report of drug 
accountability to the unit dose level (ie, tablet) is prepared and placed in both the investigator study file and the central clinical study file.
Celgene Corporation will instruct the investigator(s ) on the return, disposal and destruction of 
Pomalidomide.  A copy of the site ’s Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for drug destruction 
may be collected by [CONTACT_456] (or designee). Any revisions to a site ’s destruction process 
must be provided and approved by [CONTACT_456] (or designee) prior to implementation on this

10.1. Overview
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label study to compare the efficacy and safety of POM + 
BTZ + LD-DEX versus BTZ + LD-DEX.  For the POM + BTZ + LD-DEX treatment arm, the 
dose is based on the MTD study CC-4047-MM-005 using the same treatment combination POM 
+ BTZ + LD-DEX.
10.2. Study Population Definitions
Three study populations w ill be used for analysis: 
!The intent-to-treat (ITT) population:  All randomized subjects. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on this population
!Safety population:  All randomized subjects who take at least one dose of study medication. All safety analyses will be based on this population
!Efficacy Evaluable (EE) population:  All ITT subjects who take at least one dose of study medication and who have a baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment
10.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
Based on the primary endpoint PFS, at 2-sided significance level of 5%, with one interim 
analysis for fut ility only, an est imated total of 381 disease progression/death events are required 
to detect a 33% increase in median PFS in the POM treatment arm (Treatment Arm A; median = 
12 months) compared to that in the comparator arm (Treatment Arm B; median = 9 months) with 
80% power. In order to obtain PFS events from approximately 70% of the study ITT population 
for the final PFS analysis, a total of [ADDRESS_819696] when approximately 50% PFS information (191 
events) has occurred. The interim analysis results will be examined for fut ility only with the pre-
specified type II error spending functions described in Section 10.9.
Celgene amended the protocol in Amendment 5 to  perform the final PFS analysis earlier than 
originally planned (381 PFS events).  Recently published data from a number of Phase 3 studies 
revealed that the progression-free survival (PFS) of the bortezomib with low-dose dexamethasone (BTZ+LD-DEX) arm on this study CC-4047-MM-007 (OPTIMISMM), that 
requires prior treatment with lenalidomide as per Protocol Inclusion Criteria #7 (Section 7.2), is 
expected to be shorter than the original OPTIMISMM protocol statisti cal assumption of 9 
months (relevant median PFS data from Phase 3 ENDEAVOR, PANORAMA-1 and CASTORstudies ranging from 7 to 8 months) ( Moreau, 2017; Palumbo, 2016; San-Miguel, 2014 ). 
Subsequently, if the assumption for the pom alidomide, bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone 
(POM+BTZ+LD-DEX) arm and other study a ssumptions remain unchanged, the number of PFS 
events required for the final analysis would be le ss than originally planned. The data cutoff date 
for the revised final PFS analysis will be October 2017, by [CONTACT_617187] 320 PFS 
events are projected to be reached, representing an approximate 57% event rate (out of 559 
randomized patients). This would allow for 80% power to test a median PFS of [ADDRESS_819697] ratio of 0.73.

10.6. Efficacy Analysis
10.6.1. Primary Endpoint: Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
Progression free survival (PFS) will be calculated as the time between the randomization and 
PD, as determined by [CONTACT_617237] e International Myeloma Working Group Uniform 
Response criteria (IMWG), or death in the study treatment or PFS follow-up phase, whichever 
occurs earlier.  PFS using the EBMT response criteria will also be performed as an exploratory 
analysis.
Subjects who withdrew study treatment for any reason or received other anti-myeloma therapy 
without documented PD (as determined by [CONTACT_493084]) will be censored on the date of their last 
response assessment in the study  treatment phase prior to the study treatment discontinuation or 
initiation of other anti-myeloma therapy, respectively.  Subjects who are in the study treatment 
phase at the time of the data cut-off date without PD will be censored on the date of their last 
adequate response assessment. These rules are based on the FDA guidance for cancer trial 
endpoints (FDA Guidance, 2007), and the following table ( Table 8 ) specifies the application of 
the guidance for various common situations for the calculation of PFS.

10.6.2. Secondary Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Survival
Overall survival (OS) is calculated as the time from rando mization to death from any cause.  
Subjects who died will be considered as having OS events on the date of death. All subjects who 
are lost to follow-up prior to the date of data cut-off or who withdrew consent from the trial will 
be censored at the last date known to be alive.  Subjects who are still in the study treatment phase 
at the date of data cut-off will be censored at the last available date that the subject is known to be alive, or data cut-off date, whichever is earlier.
OS will be compared between treatment arms (ie, POM + BTZ + LD-DEX vs. BTZ + LD-DEX).  
The same s tatist ical met hods used for the PFS analysis will be used for the OS analysis. The 
analysis of OS will be based on all data available, including the survival data from the study 
treatment phase, PFS follow-up phase and the long-term follow-up phase.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Response Assessment by [CONTACT_617239], including PD, will be assessed by [CONTACT_617240], using the 
IMWG criteria ( Appendix B ).  The primary analysis for response will be based on the IRAC’s 
assessments. The response assessments by [CONTACT_617241]. 
The overall response rate [ORR; as defined as at least a PR] will be calculated as the number of 
confirmed responders divided by [CONTACT_617242]. The 
ORR together with the relative proportions in each response category (ie, stringent CR [sCR], 
CR, very good PR [VGPR], PR, SD, and PD) by [CONTACT_617243]. Confirmed responses that are documented after the initiation of other anti-myeloma treatment will not be counted as responses. However, these subjects will be included in the denominator for ORR calculation.

6 response categories (excluding the ‘Response not Evaluable (NE)’ category) will be compared between treatment arms using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (1=sCR, 2 = CR, 3 = VGPR, 4 = PR, 5 = SD, 6 = PD).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Duration of Response
Duration of myeloma response is defined as the duration from the time when the IMWG 
response criteria are first met for sCR or CR or VGPR or PR until the first date the response 
criteria are met for PD or until the subject died from any cause, whichever occurs first.  Dur ation 
of response for subjects last known to be alive with no progression after a sCR or CR or VGPR 
or PR will be censored at the date of last adequate response assessment.  Subjects with confirmed 
responses that occurred after receiving any other anti-myeloma therapy will be censored at the 
last adequate assessment prior to the initiation of such treatment.  Subjects who are non-responders will be excluded from this analysis.  Duration of response will be analyzed using the 
same statist ical method as that for PFS.

All safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population by [CONTACT_5268]. 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded accordi ng to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) version 14 or higher.  The intensity of AEs will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE version 4.0 or higher.Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on 
or after the first dose date of the study treatment a nd within [ADDRESS_819702] dose date.  
TEAEs, AEs leading to study medication discontinuation, AEs leading to dose 
reduction/interruption, AEs related to study me dication, serious AEs and AE leading to death 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], a nd preferred term for each treatment arm.  A

10.8.2. Exploratory Efficacy Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS]. Response using the EBMT Criteria
Tumor response, including PD, using the EBMT criteria ( Appendix C ) will be assessed by [CONTACT_617248].  The ORR together with the relative proportions in each response category will be 
examined. Responses after subjects receive other anti-myeloma treatments will be counted as the 
response for the new treatments received instead of the original study assigned treatments and will not be included in the response rate analysis.
Comparisons of ORR between treatment arms (2x2 table) will be performed using Fisher’s exact 
test and odds ratio will be presented together with its 95% confidence intervals.  The distribution of subjects in the 5 response categories (excluding the ‘Response not Evaluable (NE)’ category) 
will be compared between treatment arms using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (1= CR, 2 = PR, 3 = 
minimal response [MR], 4 = SD, 5 = PD). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Time to Progression and Time to Response
Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from rando mization to the first documented 
disease progression based on the IMWG response criteria by [CONTACT_493084]. Censoring for TTP is the 
same as for PFS except that death is not counted as an event. The same statistical methods used 
for PFS analysis will be used for the TTP analysis.
Time to response is calculated as the time fro m randomization to the initial documented response 
(PR or better) based on IMWG criteria. Time to response (responders only) will be compared 
between treatment arms using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, with subjects with the longest time to 
response having the highest rank.

As a sensitivity analysis for PFS, time to treatment failure (TTF) will be calculated as the time 
from randomization to discontinuation of study treatment for any reason, including disease 
progression as determined by [CONTACT_617249], treatment discontinuation due to toxicity, initiation of other anti-myeloma treatment, and death.  Subjects who have not discontinued the study treatment phase or the PFS follow-up phase 
at the time of analysis will be censored on the date of last assessment.
The same s tatist ical met hods used for the PFS analysis will be used for the TTF analysis.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Progression-free Survival 2 (PFS2)
PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to second objective disease progression, or death 
from any cause, whichever occurs first, based on the ITT population. Patients who are alive and 
for whom a second objective disease progression has not been observed should be censored at the last time known to be alive and without second objective disease progression.
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the survival distribution functions for each 
treatment arm.  A Cox proportional hazards model w ill be used to es timate hazard rate (risk) 
ratio along with 95% CIs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sub-group Analysis
The effect of treatment on the key efficacy var iables PFS, ORR and OS will be investigated 
within subgroups including following variables by [CONTACT_617250]:
!Region (US vs. ex-US)
!Age group ( %75 years vs. > 75 years);
!Gender (Male vs. Female);
!ECOG Performance Status (0, 1 vs. 2)
!Baseline cytogenetic categories
!Number prior anti-myeloma regimen (1 vs. >1);
!β2M at screening (< 3.5 mg/L vs. ≥ 3.5 m/L – ≤ 5.5 mg/L vs. ≥ 3.5 mg/L)
!Prior bone marrow or peripheral stem transplantation (Yes vs. No)
The methods described in previous sections will be used for each subgroup separately.
Additional multivariate analyses on PFS and OS will be conducted to evaluate the treatment
effect while adjusting for the above-mentioned factors.
10.8.3. Clinical Benefits

10.8.4. Quality of Life (QoL)
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire for 
Patients with Multiple Myeloma (EORTC QLQ-MY20) Module and the European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire for Patients with Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) Module w ill be used in this study. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-MY20 will be analyzed using change from baseline and percentage of change from baseline according to the functional scores and the recommendations in the EORTC scoring manual.
EQ-5D scores will be derived for each subject using country-specific weights (primary analysis 
will be done using [LOCATION_006] weights). Using EQ-5D scoring instructions, overall scores will be analyzed using change from the screening assessment at each post-screening time point. The 
worst change from screening among all available post-screening measurements for each subject 
will also be analyzed.
The expectation is that treatment with POM + BTZ + LD-DEX will not impact subjects QoL as 
compared with BTZ + LD-DEX.
Change scores from baselines will be analyzed using MIXED model using baseline covariates

One interim PFS analysis is planned when approximately 50% of the PFS information is 
reached, ie, 191 out of the total of 381 PFS events required for the final PFS analysis. The results 
of the interim PFS analysis will be used for futility assessment only, for which a non-binding 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_617178] = -6. 
Since the interim analysis has been planned a nd implemented prior to Protocol Amendment 5, it 
is not impacted by [CONTACT_11827] 5.Overall S urvival will be evaluated twice in this study: the first OS analysis will be conducted at 
the final PFS analysis, at approximately 320 even ts. The projected number of deaths will be
approximately 50%  of the total number of deaths (379) required for the final OS analysis. The 
second or final OS analysis will be conducted when the study reaches 379 deaths. The 
superiority stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_617179] (at the time of final PFS), using a 
step-down approach. If the final PFS analysis shows significant difference between treatment 
arms (p < 0.05, 2-sided), and the ORR analysis also shows significant difference (p < 0.05, 2-sided), then the interim analysis for superiority and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_617180]. The 
superiority boundary for OS is based on Lan-Demets implementation of the Pocock boundaries, 
which spends more alpha at earlier look of the data.
10.10. Statistical Approaches for Control of Alpha and Other 
Considerations
The secondary endpoints for which claims may be made in the label include overall survival and
overall response r ate. There will be two PFS analyses (including one futility analysis), one ORR 
analysis and two OS analyses.
The family-wise type I error rate will be controlled by a step-down approach from PFS to ORR 
and then to OS comparison. Specifically, ORR will only be tested if null hypothesis for PFS is rejected at 2-sided 5% significance level; OS interim analysis will only be carried out if null 
hypothesis for ORR is rejected at 2-sided 5% significance level.
Specifically, when the number of PFS events is reached for the final PFS analysis, PFS will be 
tested first. If the value of the log-rank statistic for PFS is significant at the final analysis (p <
0.05, 2-sided), then overall response rate (ORR) will be tested next, at the same significance 
level of 5%, 2-sided. If the test of ORR is significant, then OS will be tested at the overall 5% significance level, 2-sided.
The significance level of the OS analysis will be based on the number of death events at the time 
of the analysis (eg, total number of 379 deaths in 2 arms required for the final analysis), using the Pocock superiority boundary for each of the tw o OS comparisons (interim OS at the time of the 
final PFS analysis, and the final OS analysis).  The step-down approach is taken at the time of 
the final PFS analysis. ORR will be tested at the same significance level of 2-sided 0.05 level if PFS is tested significant, and the OS interim analy sis will be performed only if the tests for PFS 
and ORR are both significant at the 2-sided 5% significance level – and then the OS comparison between treatment arms will be conducted in which  a group sequential test with an overall Type I 
error probability of 5% (2-sided) is run for the hypothesis.

11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study.  It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_3433] e criteria below), regardless of etiology.  Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be cons idered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndrome.
An overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE, or abuse, 
withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to a study treatment (pomalidomide, bortezomib, or dexamethasone) should be reported as an AE.  If an overdose is associated with an AE, the 
overdose and adverse event should be reported as separate terms.  All subjects will be monitored 
for AEs during the study.  Assessments may incl ude monitoring of any or all of the following 
parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical 
findings, physical examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_617252] [ADDRESS_819705] dose of study tr eatment (ie, pomalido mide, bortezomib, or 
dexamethasone) for subjects not continuing in the PFS follow-up Phase. Only study/protocol 
related AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_617253]-up 
phase of the study.  AEs that lead to study discontinuation should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), regardless of relationship to study treatment (pomalidomide, 
bortezomib, and/or dexamethasone), that occur from the time the subject signs informed consent 
to at least [ADDRESS_819706] dose of study drug (pom alidomide, bortezomib, or 
dexamethasone), and those made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are 
suspected of being related to study treatment (pomalidomide, bortezomib and/or dexamethasone) 
must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.
Note that second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be 
reported as serious adverse events regardless of the treatment arm (Section 11.5).
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
11.2.1. Seriousness 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that:
!Results in death;
!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
Approved 930191890 9.0v Approved 1.0 v

Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 84 Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 5 Final: 14 June 2017!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events regardless of the treatment arm the subject is in (see Section 11.5).  This 
includes any SPM, regardless of causal relationship to study tr eatment (pom alidomide, 
bortezomib, or dexamethasone), occurring at any t ime from the time of signing the informed 
consent up to and including the long-term follow-up period. Events of SPM are to be reported using the SAE report form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no 
other serious criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of 
the CRF and subject’s source documents.  Documentation on the diagnosis of the SPM must be provided at th e time of reporting as a serious adverse even t (eg, any confirmatory histology or 
cytology results, X-rays, CT scans, etc.).
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
!A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72612] a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.
!Routine treatment or monitoring of the studi ed indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a comp lication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27590] a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
!A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study); must be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication re mains a reportable SAE.

unrelated to the studied indication.
!Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to study tr eatment ( POM, BTZ, DEX), action taken regarding study treatment 
(POM, BTZ, DEX), and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/intensity of the event.
The severity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the current 
active minor version of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0 or higher.); http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40.
AEs that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE should be evaluated for severity according to the 
following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]
!Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limita tion in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595]
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administra tion of study treatment
and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:

treatment ad ministration is unlikely or remote , or other 
medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
provide a s ufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of study treatment caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment and the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional study 
treatment that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].
11.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
11.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken w ith study treatment (pomalidomide, bortezomib, 
dexamethasone) as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable (eg, discontinuation, interruption, or 
reduction of study treatment, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the 
SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study;
!requires treatment, modification/ interrupti on of study treatment dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance.
Regardless of severity grade, onl y laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a

Confidential and Propri etary 87 Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 5 Final: 14 June 2017part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE.
If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject of childbearing 
potential or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events.
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated βhCG or positive pregnancy test in a 
female of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is on
study treatment, or within [ADDRESS_819707] notify Celgene Drug 
Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) 
using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_819708] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by 
[CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
subject taking investigational product should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female 
partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972],

if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate 
page(s) of the CRF and subject’s source documents.  Documentation on the diagnosis of the SPM must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory 
histology or cytology results, X-rays, CT scans, etc.).
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to study treatment
[pom alidomide, bortezomib and/or dexamethasone]) that occur from the time the subject signs 
informed consent to at least [ADDRESS_819710] dose of study treatment (pomalidomide, 
bortezomib or dexamethasone) and those made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to study  treatment (pomalidomide, bortezomib and/or 
dexamethasone).  SAEs occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27598].  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_27599] d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any fo llow-up data should be de tailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form , and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event.  
The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_493055]/EC.
11.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via

14.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions.
The Investigator should maintain a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified 
persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
document and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) for source data 
verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.
14.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent
The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any study related procedures.
Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents 
including the date.  The original informed consent document signed and dated by [CONTACT_617258]’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study  files and a copy given to the study subject.  
In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the informed consent document must be revised.  St udy subjects participating in the study when the

protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.
14.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, th e study protocol, informed cons ent document, and any other 
appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the 
documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to 
the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements.
IP can only be supplied to an Investigator by [CONTACT_72648] a nd legal requirements for starting the study has been received by 
[CONTACT_380789]. This documentation must also include a list of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be officially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document 
should also be revised.

Relapse from CRiAny one or more of the following:
Reappearance of serum or urine M-protein by [CONTACT_617261] ≥ 5% plasma cells in the bone marrowh
Appearance of any other sign or progression
aAll response categories require two consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new 
therapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies 
were performed.  Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response criteria.
bConfirmation with repeat biopsy not necessary.
cPresence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the κ/λ ratio by [CONTACT_145170]/or immunofluorescence 
requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis.  An abnormal ration reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of > 4:1 or < 1:2.

level ≥ 10 mg/dl provided serum FLC ration is abnormal.
eNot recommended for use as an indicator of response; stability of disease is best described by [CONTACT_617263]).
fAll relapse categories require two consecutive assessments made at any time before classification as relapse or 
disease progression and/or the institution of any new therapy.
gFor progressive disease, serum M-component increases of ≥ 1 gm/dL are sufficient to define relapse if starting M-
component is ≥ 5 g/dL.
hRelapse from CR has the 5% cutoff versus 10% for other categories or relapse.

Response Criteria for Response
Complete 
response (CR)a Complete response (CR) requires all of the following:
1. Absence of the original monoclonal paraprotein in serum and urine 
by [CONTACT_5294], maintained for a minimum of 42 days (6 weeks).  
The presence of oligoclonal bands consistent with oligoclonal 
immune reconstitution does not exclude CR
2. < 5% plasma cell in a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_617184], if biopsy is performed.  However, if absence of monoclonal protein is sustained for at least 42 days (6 weeks), it is not necessary 
to repeat the bone marrow, except in patients with non-secretory myeloma where the marrow examination must be repeated after an 
interval of at least 42 days (6 weeks) to confirm CR.
1. No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a 
compression fracture does not exclude response).  If absence of monoclonal protein is sustained for at least 42 days (6 weeks), it is 
not necessary to re peat the sk eletal s urvey.
2. Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas.
Partial Response 
(PR)Partial response (PR) requires all of the following
1.≥50% reduction in the level of serum monoclonal paraprotein, 
maintained for a minimum of 42 days (6 weeks).
2. Reduction in 24-hour urinary  light chain extraction by &90% or to 
∋200 mg, maintained  for a minimum of 42 days (6 weeks).

Summary of Changes CC-4047-MM-007 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 3 CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 5 Final:  14 Jun [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
Recently published data from a number of Phase 3 s tudies has revealed that the progression-free 
survival (PFS) of the bortezomib with low-dose dexamethasone (BTZ+LD-DEX) arm on study 
CC-4047-MM-007 (OPTIMISMM), that requires prior treatment with lenalidomide as per 
protocol Inclusion Criteria #7 (Section 7.2), is expected to be shorter than the current 
OPTIMISMM protocol statistical assumption of 9 months  (relevant median PFS data from Phase 
3 ENDEAVOR, PANORAMA-1 and CASTOR studies ranging from 7 to 8 months) (Moreau, 2017; Palumbo, 2016; San-Miguel, 2014).
Subsequently, if the assumption for the pomalidomide, bortezomib, and low-dose 
dexamethasone (POM+BTZ+LD-DEX) arm and othe r study assumptions remain unchanged, the 
number of PFS events required for the final analysi s would be less than originally planned in the 
study protocol and ha s been reached.
Therefore, Celgene proposes to amend the protocol to perform the final PFS analysis before the 
originally planned PFS events (381) are reached . The estimated time for a pplicable a pprovals of 
this protocol amendment is approximately October 2017, which will be used as the cutoff date 
for the revised final PFS analysis. By [CONTACT_14713], with a 5-month follow-up time for the last subject enrolled, approximately 320 PFS events are projected to be reached, representing an approximate 57% event rate (out of 559 randomized subjects). This would allow for 80% power 
to test a hazard ration of 0.73. Celgene considers the study data to be mature for the primary 
endpoint (PFS), and the expected treatment diffe rence to be achievable as well as clinically 
meaningful. The median follow-up time is e xpected to be approximately 16 months, considered 
appropriate as supported by [CONTACT_617267] (RRMM)
registration trials in similar patient settings (Dim opoulos, 2016; Moreau, 2016; Moreau, 2017; 
Palumbo, 2016; San-Miguel, 2014). Therefore, the number of PFS events required for the final 
PFS analysis is amended to approximately 320.
Updated statistical considerations for the study will be specified in the protocol amendment and 
revised statistical analysis plan (SAP).
Main changes included in this amendment have been made to the Protocol Summary, Section 
1.2, Section 10.3, Section 10.9, and Section 18 References.

Confidential and Propri etary 3 Protocol CC-4047-MM-007 Amendment 4 SOC final:  9 Dec [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
The efficacy data reported by [INVESTIGATOR_288679]1were updated with longer follow-up and 12 additional events
which resulted in accurate progression-free survival (PFS). Based on that, the assumption of 
median PFS has been adjusted in Study CC-4047-MM-007 which resulted in the revision of the 
study sample size.
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!Revision in overall sample size
∀The assumption of the median PFS duration of the experimental arm (Arm A) has 
been adjusted from 12.6 months to 12 months and the study power has been 
reduced from 85% to 80%.
∀The revised sample size will assume a median PFS of 9 months in the control arm(Arm B) versus 12 months in the expe rimental arm (Arm A), with 80% power at 
2-sided significance level of 5%. This will require 381 PFS events and a total of 
544 subjects to be enrolled for an approximately 70% event rate.
∀The interim analysis on PFS will take place when approximately 50% PFS information (191 events) has occurred.
∀The OS interim analysis will take place when approximately 50% OS information (190 deaths) has occurred.

Confidential and Propri etary 3 Protocol CC-4047-MM -007 Amendment 3 Final:  [ADDRESS_819734] [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
The Celgene sponsored study of pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma showed  a median progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) of 4.0 and 12.7 months respectively1.  More recent published data revealed 
that the triplet combination of cyclophosphamide, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (CPD) achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 65% , a median PFS of 9.2 months and a median OS 
of 16.4 months
2and the triplet combination of pomalid omide, bortezomib and dexamethasone 
(PVD) reported high clinical activity with an 81% ORR (complete response [CR]+very good partial response [VGPR]+partial response [PR]) and a median PFS of 17.[ADDRESS_819735] agent to pomalidomide with dexamethasone 
significantly increases the efficacy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
Due to the enrollment challenges experienced in the CC-4047-MM-[ADDRESS_819736] recommendations and the encouraging efficacy results reported 
with triplet combinations, specifically PVD3; Celgene has revised the study’s statistical 
assumptions by [CONTACT_617268] (PVD) from 12 months to 
12.6 months (treatment difference increased from 33% to 40% over the control arm), and by 
[CONTACT_617269] 90% to 85%; resu lting in a sample size reduction.  Further, 
Celgene has expanded the study globally in order to ensure enrollment targets are met within
appropriate timeframes.
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!Approval status of Pomalyst in the [LOCATION_002] has been updated following full 
approval notification on 23 April 2015
!Reduction in overall sample size
oThe primary purpose of this protocol amendment is to take into account recent published evidence and thereby [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-evaluate the statistical assumptions for the study.  The estimated PFS duration of the experimental arm (PVD) has been 
adjusted from 12 months to 12.6 months (increased from 33% to 40% over the 
control arm) and the study power has been reduced from 90% to 85%, resulting in a sample size reduction from approximately 782 subjects to 450 subjects.
Based on the primary endpoint PFS, at one-sided significance level of 0.025 with an interim analysis for fut ility, a total of 318 disease 
progression/death events are required to detect a 40% increase in median 
PFS in the pomalidomide (POM) treatment arm (Treatment Arm A; 
median = 12.6 months) compared to that in the comparator arm (Treatment Arm B; median = 9 months) with 85% power.  Considering

!Updates to time points for contraceptive requirements and pregnancy testing
oThe time points for contraceptive requirements and pregnancy testing for females 
of child-bearing potential (FCBP) following last dose of study treatment have 
been updated to be consistent with both pomalidomide and bortezomib
prescribing information
The amendment also includes several other minor clarifications and corrections:
!Clarification on the timing of pomalidomide dosing in subjects enrolled into Treatment Arm A
!Clarification on the timing of bortezomib dosing in subjects enrolled into both Treatment Arm A and B
!Incorporation of study drug dispensation strategy for si tes participating in Japan

Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!Updated route of administration for the bortezomib in both treatment arms to 
subcutaneous from intravenous
∀For Treatment Arm A (POM + BTZ + DEX), the dose was based on the results 
from the CC-4047-MM-005 (MM-005) Phase 1 dose escalation MTD study in 
which bortezomib was administered via IV infusion.  In the MM-005 study, the 
maximum planned dose (MPD), POM (4 mg) + IV BTZ (1.3 mg /m2) and DEX 
(20 mg subjects ≤ 75 years old/10 mg (subjects > 75 years old) was reached 
without any DLTs. Considering an early POM single agent MTD study (Richardson, 2013 ) as well as the findings in MM-005, the MPD was determined 
to be the optimal dose for the triple combination therapy.  With the optimal dose 
determined, MM-007 was initiated using the MPD dose for the combination of 
POM + BTZ + LD-DEX (with IV BTZ).  During the conduct of the MM-005 study, subcutaneous (SQ) BTZ was approved as an alternative administration 
method for BTZ (23 Jan 2013).  The SQ BTZ was reported to have a decreased 
incidence of neurotoxicity versus the IV BTZ ( Velcade
®Prescribing Information, 
2012).  To explore the SQ route of BTZ administration in combination with POM 
and DEX, the MM-005 protocol was amended to add an additional cohort of 6 
subjects at the MPD/optimal dose for the combination of POM + BTZ + LD-DEXwith BTZ administered via SQ injection.  Based on the safety, efficacy and PK 
data for this SQ BTZ cohort and general adoption in medical practice of SQ BTZ 
as standard of care due to decreased neurotoxicity, BTZ administration is now 
changed to SQ for both arms in the MM-007 study (Treatment Arm A and B).
!Added quality of life assessment to allow for an exploratory evaluation of the differences in health-related quality of life of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX versus BTZ + 
LD-DEX in subjects with relapsed or refractory MM
!Added biomarker sampling  to allow for an exploratory evaluation of Minimal Residue Disease (MRD), genomic, molecu lar/mechanistic and immune biomarkers 
and their correlation to clinical outcome measures
!Added an endpoint to allow for an exploratory evaluation of the Progression-free survival after next-line therapy (PFS2) 
!Corrected to specify that all subjects will be  followed in the long-term follow-up 
phase until death or for at least [ADDRESS_819739] is randomized into the study, or longer if clinically indicated (unle ss the follow-up is shorter due to 
withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or death).  Initially it was written that all 
subjects would be followed in the long-term follow-up phase until death or for at least [ADDRESS_819740]’s randomization date .

(pom alidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone) since pomalidomide is being provided 
as IP by [CONTACT_159475], while investigative sites will use commercially 
available bortezomib and dexamethasone and will dispense these drugs to subjects via 
prescription.  
!Clarified that samples for possible additi onal genetic studies for analysis of SPM risk 
factors will only be prepared and stored if acceptable per the local institutional policies for such sampling/storage of samples and only if sufficient sample is available after local pathology and central cytogenetic analysis is completed.

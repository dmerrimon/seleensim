This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government 
regulations , and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Thyroid hormone is important for multiple physiologic 
functions, and insufficiency and excess of thyroid hormone 
are each pathologic conditions. Thyroid hormone is tightly 
regulated through a feedback loo p between the hypothalamic 
hormone thyrotropin relea sing hormone ( TRH), the pi[INVESTIGATOR_413712] ( TSH), and the thyroid 
hormones thyroxine ( T4) and triiodothyronine ( T3) (Fig. 1, 
from [1]). Individuals with normal thyroid function maintain 
TSH levels in a narrow range, though the setpoint for thyroid 
hormone levels varies between individuals.  
 
With increasing age, there is a progressive shift 
toward higher TSH levels in people who have no 
detectable underlying thyroid disease  
(Fig. 2, from [2]). This leads  to a higher  prevalence of 
subclinical hypothyr oidism in older people. 
Subclinical hypothyroidism  is defined as elevated 
TSH levels with normal levels of thyroid hormones . It 
is a common clinical diagnosis  affecting 10 -15% of 
individuals age d 65 years and older  and up to 20% of 
those 85 years and older .[1-5] The purpose of this 
study is to examine mechanisms to explain th e age-
related increase in TSH levels  and resulting 
subclinical hypothyroidism .  
 
In addition, it is not clear if individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism benefit from 
replacement of thyroid hormone. Some argue that subclinical hypothyroidism should be 
treated as a form of mild hypothyroidism, whereas others argue that it may be adaptive.  
The question is whether, in older people, a  TSH level just outside the reference range 
should be considered a pathologic finding. We hypothesize that slightly elevated TSH 
result s from an age -related decrease in the function of TSH that leads to an adaptive shift 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -thyroid setpoint , rather than an early sign of thyroid failure . That is, the 
TSH that is produced by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_413713]. More TSH would then be required to keep thyroid hormone level production 
constant.  
 
There is evidence  to support the biologic plausibility of a decline in TSH bioactivity with 
age. TSH with decreased bioactivity  has been detected using cell -based methodologies, 
and has been reported in conditions of thyroid axis dysfunction, ranging from primary and

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_413732] -producing pi[INVESTIGATOR_239572] .[3-6] An inverse 
correlation between TSH bioactivity and age was  also found in 11 he althy men and 
women aged 28 -52 years. [4]  
 
Changes in TSH structure including glycosylation patterns affect its biologic activity. [7] 
These changes in glycosylation could be due to alterations in TRH output from the 
hypothalamus , as is found with age  for other hypothalamic hormones such as GHRH and 
GnRH. [8, 9] Unfortunately, TRH cannot be measured directly; however, TSH bioactivity 
can be measured before and after TRH stimulation testing to provide indirect evidence of 
this mechanism . We can then create perturbations to the system such as adding back 
thyroid hormones to understand these hormonal feedback loops. Together the TRH 
stimulation testing and the crossover design with T4 and T3 add back  will provide insight 
into the dynamics of the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -thyroid axis in older people with subclinical 
hypothyroidism.  
1.2 Interventional Agent s 
TRH, a naturally occurring  hypothalamic neuro peptide in humans, is an endogenous 
ligand for the TRH receptor. It is composed o f three amino acids and stimulates  the 
release of TSH and prolactin from the anterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117].  The release of TSH then 
stimulates the release of thyroid h ormones, T4 and T3  (Fig. 1).  Synthetic TRH has been 
used for over [ADDRESS_521548] ered 400 µg TRH  to 8 healthy men  and noted that 
plasma TRH levels rose from <0.4 ng/mL to 33 ± 7 ng/mL (mean ± SEM) 2 minutes after 
injection and linearly fell to 2.9 ng/mL 20 min after injection. The mean half -life of TRH 
was found to b e 5.3 ± 0.5 min. [10]. TSH levels rise rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]; reach a peak, and later decline 
after TRH administration. Anderson et al administered 100 -800 µg TRH to 79 healthy men 
and found that TRH -stimulated TSH levels peaked after 30 min and fell to baseline levels 
in approximately 3 hour s.[11] 
 
Levothyroxine (LT4 ) and liothyronine (LT3) are synthetic forms of T4 and T3, which are 
endogenous hormones produced by [CONTACT_413733][INVESTIGATOR_2117] . The majority of circulating thyroid hormone 
in the blood is in the form of T4 . T4 is then converted to T3 in target tissues , with T3 being 
the mo re physiologically active  hormone . Both T4 and T3 bind to the thyroid receptor in 
cell nuclei  and regulate DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Human studies show 
that thyroid hormone levels can also alter TSH bioactivity . [4, 6, 12] T4 is metabolized 
slowly with eighty percent of circulating T3 derived from T4 through deiodination. The 
half-life of LT4 is six to eight  days. The half -life of LT3 is one to two  days. [13-15]  
 
1.3 Preclinical Data  
Slightly elev ated TSH may result from an age -related alteration  in the function of T RH, 
analogous to the age -related alterations found in other hypothalamic hormones such as 
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 5 
Version:   12/18/2018 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_413734]. [8, 9] Preclinical data show that alterations  to the structure and 
packaging of the TSH molecule  may affect its function . TSH is a glycoprotein composed 
of an alpha and a beta subunit that requires glycosylation of three asparagine residues in 
order to have maximal function at the TSH receptor. [16] When the glycosylation pattern 
is abnormal, TSH bindin g to its receptor is less efficient, resulting in decreased bioactivity. 
These changes in glycosylation could be due to alterations in TRH output from the 
hypothalamus, as suggested by [CONTACT_413735] .[7, 17-19] Taylor et al. showed that 
hypothalamic as compared to primary hypothyroidism caused by [CONTACT_413736]. Taylor and 
Weintraub later showed that this alteration in TSH carbohydrate structure could be 
corrected by [CONTACT_413737]. [19] Hypothalamic TRH output cannot be 
measured directly. However, TSH bioactivity can be measured before and after TRH 
stimulation testing to provide indirect evidence of this mechanism.  
 
In addition to TRH, there is evidence that thyroid hormones themselves c an alter the 
bioactivity of thyroid stimulating hormone. T hyroid hormone status has been shown to 
modulate glycosyltransferase mRNA levels in mouse thyrotrophs. [20] This has been 
postulated to result from a direct action of T3 on thyroid hormone responsive elements in 
the upstream regulatory region of the sialyl transferase gene. If so, TSH glycosylation 
could be affected by [CONTACT_413738] -associ ated decline in T3 levels.   
 
Rodent data indicate that replacement therapy with LT4 alone does not achieve adequate 
levels of T3 in all tissues. [21] However, combine d replacement therapy of LT3 to LT4 
completely restored euthyroidism in thyroidectomized rats at much lower doses of LT4 
than those needed to normalize LT3 in most tissues when L -T4 alone was used. The LT4 -
LT3 cross -over design will give us insight into th is mechanism.  
 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
In men and women from the Cardiovascular Health Study with a mean age of 74 years at 
the time of the initial TSH , we found a gradual increase in TSH levels over a 13-year 
period , with an average increase of 0.28 mU/L (p<0.01)  and no change in free T4 levels, 
suggesting a shift in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -thyroid set point. These data parallel the 0.32 mU/L TSH 
increase over a 13 -year period published in a younger population (mean age 58 y ears at 
the second TSH), also without chang e in free T4 levels. [22] NHANES data  also illustrate 
a progressive shift toward higher TSH levels with increasing age [2] and another study 
has shown higher TSH in people with exceptional longevity. [23] 
 
The hypothes es that there is a decline in TSH bioactivity with age  and that thyroid 
hormone supplementation can  alter bioactivity  are supported  by [CONTACT_413739] [4, 6, 
12]. Oliveira et al. evaluated in  vitro serum TSH bioactivity and found  a strong inverse 
correlation between serum TSH bioactivity and age  in 11 normal controls . This study also 
showed a decrease in TSH bioactivity in  patients with primary hypothyroidism. The 
bioactivity improve d with levothyroxine supplementation  and was positively  correlated 
with change in  T3 levels  but not free T4 levels. Evaluation of TSH glycosylation patterns 
showed a higher proportion of sialylated TSH molecules in patients with decreased  
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 6

molecule was also shown in patients with central hypothyroidi sm due to Sheehan’s 
syndrome [3] and c hronic TRH administration in patients with central hypothyr oidism has 
been shown to improve TSH bioactivity .[24] These data suggest that hypothalamus -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -thyroid feedback loops are regulated by [CONTACT_413741].  
 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
TRH stimulation testing:  
TRH has a short half -life and does not exhibit a sustained biological effect after a single 
intravenou s bolus . For decades, TRH has been intravenously administered to a variety 
of study populations, including patients with thyroid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and hypothalamic 
disorders .[10, 11, 25] In this study  we will be using the standard clinical dose of 200 µg 
at three time points . This dose has been  used in studies of  dynamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_413714] n testing. [25, 26] Side effects  have been reported in about 50% of 
patients , but side effects are generally minor and persist for only a few minutes following 
injection.  
 
These side effects  include [27]: 
 
Most frequent: transient nausea, flushing, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]  (without change i n heart rate) , 
lightheadedness , bad taste in mouth, abdominal discomfort, dry mouth,  and an urge to 
urinate  
 
Less frequent: anxiety, sweating, tightness in throat  (without change in oxygenation or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) , pressure in chest, tingling sensation, and dr owsiness  
 
Uncommon: change in blood pressure , seizure  
 
The mean  elevation of blood pressure reported wa s 16 mm of mercury. The peak blood 
pressure elevation occu rred between one and five minutes , with a return to baseline blood 
pressure levels within ten minutes. [11] Participants with uncontrolled blood pressure or 
history of ischemic cardiac disease or stroke will be excluded.  
 
Seizures have only been reported in those with a history of seizure disorder . Individuals 
with a hist ory of seizure will be excluded.  
 
No direct benefits a re expected to result from TRH administration.  
 
 
LT4 and LT3:  
 
LT4 and LT3 have each been in therapeutic use for more than 50 years. Adverse 
reactions to either drug are exclusively related to excessiv e thyroid hormone, which can 
produce iatrogenic  thyrotoxicosis. No serious adverse events were reported in  a

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_413742]4/LT3 crossover study, and no symptoms of hyperthyroidism  or 
hypothyroidism were reported. [25, 28] Participants will be asked about hyperthyroid 
symptoms, and a TSH level will be checked prior to the planned date if a patient reports 
any hyperthyroid symptoms.  
 
Administration and monitoring of LT4 and LT3 will be modeled off of a published 
protocol .[28] The dosing of thyroid hormone will be based on published studies of 
thyroid hormone replacement in subclinical hypothyroidism. The literature supports  a 1 
mcg/kg/day  dose for initiation of therapy. [29-34]  We will tailor the thyro id hormone dose 
to each subject  using  a weight -based dosing scheme  that is also based on how far the 
subject’s TSH level is from goal. The dosing scheme is conservative . 1mcg/kg is the 
dose reported in the literature. T he initial dose in our study will be lower than  that - 
0.7mcg /kg/day given that we are studying  subjects  70 years and older . We will use 
thrice daily dosing due to the short half -life of LT3.  
 
LT4 
Each participant will start on 0.7mcg/kg/day divided into three daily doses.  
The dose will be adjusted according to subject weight and how far the TSH level is from 
goal.  There will be a medication cap such that no dose adjustment will exceed 25 mcg 
per day.  
 
LT3 
The starting dose of liothyronine wi ll be 1/[ADDRESS_521549] weight and how far the TSH 
level is from goal.  No dose adjustment  will be greater than 8.3  mcg per day.  
 
The total daily dose of study medications will be adjusted to a TSH of 0.5 -1.5 mU/L  
using the adjustment scheme to avoid excess thyroid hormone replacement.  
 
At the ti me of crossover of study drug, p articipants will undergo a [ADDRESS_521550] benefits a re expected to result from LT4 and LT3 administration.

3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
The study design is a randomized, double -blind, cross -over study in which we will 
examine the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -thyroid axis in older subclinical hypothyroid individuals in response 
to TRH stimulation and to daily LT4 or LT3 supplementation over a m inimum period of 14 
consecutive weeks. Physiologic responses to LT4 and LT3 supplementation will also be 
examined. Thirty participants will receive a total of three TRH stimulation tests and one

5 Study Drug s  
5.1 Description  
TRH is a n endogenous hormone that is a ligand for the TRH receptor  and is involved in 
regulating TSH release  from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] . TSH stimulates release of T4, which can be 
converted to T3 , a more active form . Both T4 and T3 regulate metaboli sm in humans . 
 
TRH will be purchased from  American Peptide , which will produce a pharmaceutical 
grade (cGMP) formulation of TRH  appropriate for human use . The TRH we will use is a 
tri-peptide and has a molecular weight of 362.3 . TRH is supplied as a white to clear 
crystalline and powder. Syringes  contain ing 200 mcg of TRH will be made by [CONTACT_413749] . TRH is intended for intravenous 
administra tion. 
 
Synthetic forms of T4 (levothyroxine, or LT4) and T3 (liothyronine, or LT3) will be 
purchased and shipped to  the IDS pharmacy at Penn . Each of these medications is FDA 
approved for treatment of conditions of hypothyroidism. LT4 has a molecular weight of 
776.87  and LT3 has a molecular weight of 650.98 . LT4 and LT3 will be supplied as dose -
tailored capsule s filled with pharmaceutical grade powder. The capsules will be provided  
by [CONTACT_17387] .  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
On Day 1 ( Visit 1 ) participants will receive an IV injection of 200 µg TRH  by a CTRC nurse 
plus ver bal and written instructions on thyroid hormone dosing and sufficient study 
medication for 6 weeks. On the same day , participants will receive LT4 or LT3 in 
randomized order. Each will be titrated to a target TSH level of 0.5 -1.5mU/L. 
Administration of LT4  and LT3 and monitoring in this study will be performed in a similar 
fashion to  a published protocol  and based on the literature of thyroid hormone 
replacement in subclinical hypothyroidism .[28-34] 
 
LT4 
Each participant will start on 0.7mcg/kg/day divided into three daily doses.  
The dose will be adjusted according to subject weight and how far the TSH level is from 
goal.  There will be a medication cap such that no dose adjustment will exceed 25 mcg 
per day.  
 
LT3 
The starting dose of liothyronine will be 1/3 of that of levothyroxine  ( 0.23 mcg/kg/day of 
LT3) divided into three daily doses. We will  titrate the dose according to subject weight 
and how far the TSH level is from goal.  No dose adjustment will be greater than 8.3  
mcg per day.

6 Study Procedures  
6.1 Screening Visit  (Day -60 to Day -1) 
Upon arrival at the CT RC, the participant will review and sign the IRB -approved consent 
form. The participant will also review an optional exploratory genetics research study IRB -
approved consent form and sign only if they agree to parti cipate in the optional study. 
They will t hen be assigned a unique screening visit identification number. Participants will 
be asked for a thorough history detailing their past medical history, current medications, 
and social habits. They will perform the MMSE. The research nurse will measure weig ht, 
height, blood pressure, heart rate, and perform a [ADDRESS_521565] blood drawn to evaluate lab 
parameters for eligibility criteria. A free thyroxine (FT4) level in conjunction wit h a TSH 
level will be sent to confirm subclinical hypothyroidism. The t hyroid stimulating hormone 
(TSH) test obtained during the screening visit is measured at least [ADDRESS_521566] ivity and hea rt rate monitor  for 4 days ) prior to the first study

and activity monitors on and off.  
6.2 Visit 1  (Day 1)  
Participants will arrive at 7:[ADDRESS_521568] calorimetry  will be 
completed .  
 
An IV will be inserted into the forearm and blood will be collected at times -5 and 0, 
followed by [CONTACT_82037] 200 µg TRH.[28] Additional blood will be collected at 5, 10, 15, 
20, 30, 60, 120, a nd 180 minutes, immediately processed, and stored at -80 degrees for 
measures of TSH, free T4, and total T3 (all time points ), prolactin , alpha subunit , reverse 
T3 (0, 60, and 180 minutes) , and a lipid profile (time 0). Additional samples at the 0, 120, 
and 180 time points  will be processed and saved for TSH bioactivity measurements  and 
TSH structure evaluation.  If the participant consents to the optional exploratory genetic 
research study, t hen a sample will be collected, processed and saved for genetic testing 
at one study visit only  (time -5). 
 
Blood pressure will be monitored before administration of TRH, and at 5, 15, [ADDRESS_521569] will be completed.  
 
Participants will be provided with lunch  and undergo a DXA scan .  
Participants will then undergo arterial tonometry and Doppler echocardiography testing. 
Assessment of arterial load will be made from this data.   
Arterial tonometry:  We will use a commercially available system (SphygmoCor, AtCor 
Medical) that uses a high -fidelity applanation tonometer (Millar Instruments; Houston, 
TX). The tonometer will be used to record carotid, radial and femoral arterial pressure 
waveforms. Mean b rachial pressure will be obtained from a radial waveform calibrated 
with brachial systolic and diastolic pressures, measured with a validated oscillometric 
device. Diastolic and mean pressures will then be used to calibrate the carotid pressure 
waveform. C arotid -femoral and carotid -radial pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be computed 
from the time delay between the waveform foot on these arterial sites and the distance 
between the sites (measured on the body surface), where PWV = distance/time.  
Doppler echoca rdiography : will be performed using a standard protocol, which will include 
parasternal views and api[INVESTIGATOR_413718]. It will also include pulsed -wave 
Doppler interrogation of flow velocities in the LV outflow tract, mitral inflow and mitra l 
annular velocities. Flow volume will be computed by [CONTACT_413755] -sectional area measured with 3D echocardiography.

Version:   12/18/[ADDRESS_521570] any known risks.  
During various procedures  (arterial tonome try, echocardiography), we will use 
 adhesive electrodes  attached to the participant’s skin to record the electrical  
signal from the heart. These may occasionally cause skin itching and irritation.  
 
Arterial tonometry and Doppler echocardiographic examinations will only be performed 
by [CONTACT_413756].  
 
Prior to the end of the visit the participant will receive verbal and written instructions on 
thyroid hormone dosing and provided with sufficient study medication for 6 weeks. The n 
they will be discharged home.  
6.3 Day 2 -Week 4 
Participants will consume coded capsules of either LT4 or LT3 supplements as divided 
doses three times per day in the morning, afternoon, and evening.  
6.4 Medication  Titration  (Q4Weeks ) 
Participants will have TSH testing every 4 weeks  (acceptable range 4 -8 weeks)  at a Penn 
outpatient laboratory facility  until TSH is at goal , and then the participant will be scheduled 
for Visit [ADDRESS_521571] TSH 
level.  
 
Symptoms of palpi[INVESTIGATOR_413719]. The total daily dose of study medications will be adjusted by 
[CONTACT_413757] a TSH of 0.5 -1.5 mU/L. New study medication for 
adjustment dosing will be mailed overnight to participants within [ADDRESS_521572] thyroid 
preparation (LT4 or LT3). Subjects will stop taking study drug for [ADDRESS_521573]  any symptoms

completion of the subject participation portion of the study, the optional genetic 
specimens, de -identified, will be sent to [CONTACT_413777] at Virginia Commonwealth 
University for analysis.  When complete, the samples and analysis will be sent back to 
Penn for incorporation into the study database.   
Total blood volume drawn at each study visit is approximately <90 mL. Total  blood drawn

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
We plan to enroll 30 subjects with an anticipated 15% dropout rate . With an alpha of 0.05 
and 80% power and 15% dropout, we will be able to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_521577] deviation 
(SD) change in outcome from baseline. A 3 SD improvement in unstimulated TSH 
bioactivity has been reported after treatment of overt prima ry hypothyroidism .[4] No

parameters at baseline compared to each thyroid hormone supplementation (LT4 or LT3) 
and our secondary goal will be to compare phys iologic responses to LT4 and LT3 therapy 
from baseline. The area under the curve (AUC) for TRH -stimulated TSH response will be 
calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The maximum serum TSH concentration following 
TRH administration (TSH max) will be obtained  by [CONTACT_413760] -time profiles. Changes in TSH bioactivity, free T4, and total T3 will be 
determined using the higher of the [ADDRESS_521579] parameters 
(AUC, TSH max, ∆ TSH bioactivity, ∆ free T4, ∆ total T3). Additional outcomes will include 
changes in unstimulated TSH bioactivity, REE, body temperature, weight, b ody 
composition, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], physical actigraphy  and heart rate , cognitive testing, symptom s, 
arterial tonometry, and Doppler echocardiog raphy.

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related 
documents such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc.) 
LT4 and LT3 in subclinical hypothyroidism    Page 22 
Version:   12/18/2018 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_30292]   Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
 Suggests that the resear ch places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of t he study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should 
be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are tho se that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, 
drug overdose or abuse,  a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413721].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded a s 
non-serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as 
the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment 
follow -up.  For thi s study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_521581] administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition

Version:   12/18/2018 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_30292]  A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded  as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as 
an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject t o report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the

discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this 
study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of 
the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a su bsequently conceived 
offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one 
of the following  conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormal ity is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of 
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequen t follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202110] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented 
as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported 
as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5110] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.

events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all 
adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the 
appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).   All clearly related signs, 
symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source 
document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical 
course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followe d up to 
determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period 
and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation 
should be recorded and reported immediately.

information on ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the study 
sponsor . 
8.3.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB  
This section descr ibes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_85399], affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety 
reporting to the Penn IRB. The University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires 
expedited reportin g of those events related to study participation that are unforeseen and 
indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The Penn IRB will not 
acknowledge safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the 
criteria o utlined below.  The Penn IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the 
following problems within 10 working days from the time the investigator becomes aware 
of the event:  
 Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non -serious, on -
site or off -site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_58812]:  
Unexpected  (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not 
accurately reflected in the protocol -related d ocuments, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -
approved informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, 
such as product labeling and package inserts.)  
AND  
Related  to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research 
procedures” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was 
more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].)  
 
Reporting Process  
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported 
to the Penn IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or 
Others Including Reportable Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event (including 
a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, 
follow -up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study 
documentation).

Deaths that occur during the course of a research study and that are:  
 Unexpected; AND  
 Related to the research study; AND  
 When other participants are believed to  be at an increased risk of harm  
 
Must be reported to the IRB within 3 days from the time the investigator becomes aware 
of the death .  
 
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB:  
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
 Any adverse event that would cause th e sponsor to modify  protocol or informed 
consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_284581].  
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, 
in terms of severity or frequency . For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more 
frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research 
study is of no therapeutic value.  
 Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol.  
 Breach of confidentiality  
 Chang e to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant.  
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to 
remain on the study.  
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
 Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the  IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_341871], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
8.3.3  Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA  
The study sponsor is required to report certain study even ts in an expedited fashion to 
the FDA.  These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety

Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
 
 Within 15 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life-threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when 
event was deemed reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory ani mals that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, 
teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 
Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning  
similar adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the 
previous reports.  
 
Reporting Process  
Adverse events may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative format. If supplied 
as in a narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied is noted above at the

8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_344899]/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate 
reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and 
implementation of a site data an d safety -monitoring plan (see section 9 Auditing, 
Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the 
number and type of serious adverse events.  Additional medical monitoring will be 
performed by [CONTACT_413769].  
[ADDRESS_521586] of  1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the 
following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who wil l use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use a ll information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the 
subject is alive) a t the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.

Protocol Summary  
Purpose  
A research and community service partnership, comprising the Medical College of Wisconsin 
(MCW), UWM College of Nursing, and the non -profit asthma coalition Fight Asthma Milwaukee 
(FAM) Allies, proposes to describe and improve health -relevant indoor air quality (IAQ) conditions 
within diverse urban Milwaukee child day care environments. Inferior IAQ could contribute 
significantly to the development a nd exacerbation of asthma6,7,[ADDRESS_1256582] aims to understand the levels of indoor organic pollution and fine particles in the air, as 
well as temperature and humidity, using inexpensive, consumer -grade, Internet cloud - enabled 
continuous indoor air quality monitors. These air quality variables are established risk factors for 
both the development and exacerbation of asthma  
Aims  
1) Assess baseline IAQ characteristics in urban Milwaukee daycare settings.  
 Objective 1.1: Deploy 36 IAQ monitors in 36 childcare settings by [CONTACT_14622], 
2018.  
 Objective 1.2: Collect 36 IAQ monitors from 36 daycare settings by [CONTACT_30097], 
2019.  
 Objective 1.3: Identify trends based on subtype analysis of IAQ baseline 
findings between large facility based, small home based and unlicensed 
daycare settings through data analysis by [CONTACT_11711] 2019.  
2) Determine the efficacy of the Green Cleaning for Asthma educational curriculum 
to alter IAQ and daycare staff cleaning/pest control behaviors objectively.  
 Objective 2.1: Deliver Green Cleaning for Asthma classes for staff in 36 
daycare organizations by [CONTACT_36466], 2019.  
 Objective 2.2: Implement and collect IAQ pre and post surveys from 1 
designated staff member in each of 36 daycare organizations by [CONTACT_30097], 
2019.  
 Objective 2.3: Identify trends in relationship to the educational intervention 
with regards to monitoring d evice variables including tVOC, PM2.5 and 
relative humidity variables and composites through data analysis by [CONTACT_11711] 
2019.  
 Objective 2.4: Identify behavior changes of daycare staff with regards to 
cleaning practices, VOC generation as a result of the educa tional intervention 
through data analysis by [CONTACT_11711] 2019.  
3) Determine the feasibility of a future daycare oriented educational and research 
program to alter development of asthma and/or asthma exacerbations by 
[CONTACT_896437].  
 Objective 3.1: Assess the fea sibility of educational training and community 
deployment of the educational curriculum.  
 Objective 3.2: Develop proposals to investigate child health within daycare 
environments to determine future efficacy of IAQ interventions upon health 
outcomes such a s asthma incidence, severity and exacerbations and daycare 
staff knowledge about asthma and recognition of symptoms of concern.  
Research Design  
A prospective randomized stepped -wedge trial is proposed. The partnership will engage day 
care facilities in a  4-month intervention. Half of the facilities will receive education at the 
second month, allowing the team to assess pre - and post -education air quality readings. 
The rest of the facilities will receive education at the third month. Devices will be remove d 
from the day cares after the 4th month.  
Enrolled day cares will be provided with IAQ monitoring and continuing education -eligible 
educational programs for day care staff. Nursing students from UWM, an Americorp worker, 
and MCW community health workers w ill be trained to provide the curriculum. The groups 
will be block randomized to start the educational program at either 1 month or 2 months 
after initial baseline IAQ measurements. Summaries of the findings from the assigned 
devices will be shared with da y care staff at the conclusion of the study.  
Two intervention schedules will be implemented:  
Group A   
Group B  
Month  Outreach  Month  Outreach  
[ADDRESS_1256583] survey  
Within each intervention group, two cohorts will be determined by [CONTACT_896438]’ licensing for the program. Specifically, Licensed Family 
Child Care Centers provide care for up to eight children (to be referenced as hom e 
daycare), Licensed Group Child Care Centers provide care for nine or more children. Other 
data to be obtained from the daycare will include age of facility, type of heating, presence 
of air conditioning, type of air filtration, presence of gas ranges/sto ves, usual cleaning 
regimen and cleaners, typi[INVESTIGATOR_896428], whether windows are typi[INVESTIGATOR_896429], 
the State Youngstar rating (if a participant), # of children under 5, and over 5 years of age.  
Procedures  

Educational curriculum: A day care -specif ic modification of the FAM Allies “Green Cleaning for 
Asthma” curriculum will be provided to each facility by [CONTACT_896439], an AmeriCorps 
worker, FAM Allies volunteers, or MCW staff. Surveys of present cleaning/pesticide practices and 
air quality i nventory will be obtained before and after the educational intervention. One person 
from each daycare will fill out the pre and post surveys and will receive a $[ADDRESS_1256584] survey. Each daycare organization will receive a $[ADDRESS_1256585] for 
coordinating the training and housing the indoor air quality device.  
IAQ monitoring: Portable IAQ devices will be deployed within the day care facility to measure 
variables pertinent to asthma such as total volatile organic compounds (tVOC), particulate matter 
(PM2.5), temperature, and relative humidity. These consumer -grade montiors are inexpensive, 
silent, unobtrusive, and upload data continuously via a cellular WiFi hotspot device provided by [CONTACT_10748]. Continuous data will be tagged with d ate of the educational intervention, and statistical 
analysis for trends over time as a result of the intervention will be conducted. Secondary analyses 
will evaluate which variables and practice changes are associated with improved IAQ.

Page | 8  1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design  
 
This is a non -randomized, open -label, phase Ib/II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
palbociclib, an oral selective CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1127224] generation selective 
estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) in patients with metastatic hormone receptor positive b reast cancer. 
Patients must have hormone receptor positive (HR+) disease and HER2 negative disease (defined as ER ≥10% 
or PR≥10%, and HER2 - negative by [CONTACT_69162]/or FISH). Patients must have received at least [ADDRESS_1127225]  clinical benefit , 
the regimen will be c onsidered worthy of further study.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease (s) 
 
The majority of breast cancer mortality is due to hormone receptor positive (HR+) disease [1]. Endocrine 
treatments are the mainstay therapy for ER+ breast cancer. These treatments include targeting the ER  for 
inhibition using the antagonist tamoxifen, reducing ER activation by [CONTACT_814340] (AI) and more recently down regulating and enhancing ER 
degradation by [CONTACT_814341] (SERDs). Despit e effective endocrine treatments, de -novo and acquired 
endocrine resistance remains an important clinical challenge. This underscores the need for new therapeutic 
strategies to treat HR+ metastatic breast cancer.  
 
2.2 IND Agents  
 
2.2.1 Palbociclib  
 
PD-0332991 (palbociclib), an orally active pyridopyrimidine, is a potent first -in-class, highly selective 
reversible inhibitor of CDK 4 and CDK6 (IC50 = 11 nM; Ki = 2 nM) with a molecular weight of 447.53. Data 
from nonclinical studies indicate that palboci clib may have cytoreductive as well as cytostatic effects on tumor 
cells.  The compound prevents cellular DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_4642] G1 into 
the S phase, as demonstrated both in laboratory models and in early clinical tr ials. CDK4 and CDK6 control G1 
to S phase transit by [CONTACT_4639] D -type cyclins  [2-4].  The CDK4/6/Cyclin D1 complex phosphorylates the 
retinoblastoma susceptibility ( RB1) gene product (Rb), releasing the E2F and DP transcription factors that drive 
expression of genes required for S -phase entry. CDK activity and G1 progression is negatively regulated by 
[CONTACT_196344]-Kip ( P27,P21) and INK4 family, typi[INVESTIGATOR_401103] p16  [5-9]. Overexpression of p16 in cells with normal Rb 
inhibits both CDK4 -and CDK6 - associated kinase activity and Rb phos phorylation, with subsequent cell cycle 
arrest  [10, 11]. 
 
There is a strong link between the actions of estradiol and the G1 -S phase transition, where the estradiol effector 
is the cyclin D1 -CDK4/6 -Rb complex [12]. Cyclin D1 is a dire ct transcriptional target of ER [13, 14] and 
microinjection of antibodies to cyclin D1 inhibi ts estrogen -induced S -phase entry. In addition, anti -estrogen -
induced growth arrest of ER+ breast cancer cells is accompanied by [CONTACT_345897] D1 expression  [15], while 
endocrine resistance is associated with persistent  cyclin D1 expression and Rb phosphorylation [16]. Consistent 
with the notion that the main function of cyclin D1 is to activate CDK4/ 6, its oncogenic activity is dependent on 
CDK4/6 -associated kinase activity  [17] and CDK4/[ADDRESS_1127227] effective in tumors with gene 
amplification  and overexpression of cyclin D1 [18-20], which is common in ER+ breast cancer. Genetic 
aberrations leading to hyperactivation of cyclin D1 -CDK4/6 is particularly common in ER+ breast cancer  [21], 
consistent with its critical role in the tumorigenesis of this cancer subtype, making CDK4/6 inhibitors 
particularly attractive agents for ER+ breast cancer.  
 
   
Page | [ADDRESS_1127228] as well as 
potential secondary cytoreductive activity. Single agent palbociclib has shown antiproliferative effects 
(selective G [ADDRESS_1127229]) on Rb -positive cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [19] where palbociclib activity was 
associated with reduced Rb -phosphorylation and decreased expression of the c ell proliferation marker Ki67. 
Palbociclib showed no activity in Rb -negative tumor cell xenografts, consistent with CDK4/6 inhibition as the 
sole mode of action [19]. 
 
Treatment of cultured tumor cells with palbociclib causes growth arrest that is accompanied by [CONTACT_814342]4 or CDK6 on residues serine -[ADDRESS_1127230] cancer cell lines. Results from these 
experiments indicate that those cell lines that are more sensitive to palbocicl ib (IC 50 < 150 nM) have low levels 
of CDKN2A (p16) and high levels of Rb1, while resistant cell lines show the opposite characteristics. In this 
study, ER+ breast cancer seems to be particularly appropriate for treatment with palbociclib; sensitive cell li nes 
in this panel represent mostly the luminal ER+ subtype [29].  The combination of palbociclib with tamoxifen has 
been tested in vitro in ER+ breast cancer cell lines indicating a synergistic interaction   and provided a biologic 
rationale for evaluating the combination of palbociclib with anti -hormonal therapy in the clinic.  
 
In nonclinical studies, palbociclib and its active lactam metabolite, PF -05089326, demonstrated little or no 
inhibition of cytochrom e P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 enzyme 
activities and thus, showed low potential for PK DDI with drugs that are substrates for these CYPs. However, 
palbociclib and its metabolite, PF -05089326, caused time -dependent inhibition o f CYP3A -mediated midazolam 
1’-hydroxylase and testosterone 6β -hydroxylase activities and, therefore, may have the potential for PK DDI 
with drugs for which CYP3A -mediated metabolism constitutes the primary mechanism of clearance. 
Palbociclib did not cause induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 messenger ribonucleic acid 
expression and/or enzyme activity in vitro in human hepatocytes at concentrations exceeding 50 -fold of the 
palbociclib unbound steady -state plasma C max determined at therapeutic dose s in humans; thus, the potential for 
palbociclib to induce these enzymes is considered to be low at clinically relevant concentrations. The potential 
for palbociclib to inhibit the activities of selected uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) en zymes 
(UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7) was also assessed, and the likelihood of DDI 
associated with inhibition of these Phase 2 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations is considered low.  
 
Inhibition of efflux transporters (p -glycoprotein [P-gp] and breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP]), hepatic 
uptake transporters (organic anion -transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1  and OATP1B3), hepatic efflux 
transporter (bile salt export pump [BSEP]), and renal transporters (organic anion transporter [ OAT] 1, OAT3, 
and organic cation transporter [OCT] 2) by [CONTACT_814343].  
 
In vitro, palbociclib is metabolized mainly by [CONTACT_097]3A and sulfotransferase 2A1  (SULT2A1)  enzymes. Drugs 
that are known to induce or inhibit the activities of these enzymes may alter the clearance and systemic 
exposure of palbociclib.  
 
Palbociclib Pharmacokinetic (PK) Data  
 
To date, pharmacokinetic data have been collected in 8 clinic al studies for a total of over 250 advanced cancer 
   
Page | 11  patients and 30 healthy volunteers (A5481001, A5481002, A5481003, A5481004, A5481008, A5481009, 
A5481010, and A5481011). In the FIP trial (A5481001) the exposure increased in a dose proportional manner 
over the dose range of 25 to 225 mg QD following palbociclib administration on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1, 
although some variability (low to moderate) around these doses was observed particularly at the [ADDRESS_1127231] eady state, palbociclib was absorbed with a median T max of ~4 
hours. The mean palbociclib Vz/F was 2583 L, which is significantly greater than total body water (42 L), 
indicating that palbociclib extensively penetrates into peripheral tissues. Palbociclib was eliminated slowly; the 
mean elimination half -life (t 1⁄2) was 28.8 hours  and the mean CL/F was 63.1 L/hour. Palbociclib accumulated 
following repeated dosing with a median R ac of 2.4, which is consistent with the terminal half -life. 
 
The effect of food  on the bioavailability of palbociclib when administered as the commercial  free base capsule, 
was investigated in Study A5481021. The administration of the free base formulation of palbociclib with food 
(including a high fat or a low fat meal given togethe r with palbociclib, or moderate fat meals given 1 hour 
before and 2 hours after palbociclib) resulted in more uniform drug absorption and significantly reduced the 
intersubject variability in drug exposure when compared to the administration of free base f ormulation of 
palbociclib in a fasted state. The relative bioavailability of the commercial free base capsule administered with 
food and the isethionate capsule administered under overnight and minimal fasting conditions was investigated 
in Study A5481036.  The two fasting conditions for administration of isethionate capsules represent the [ADDRESS_1127232] to food intake in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 1/[ADDRESS_1127233] of multiple d osing of a 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole (2 00 mg QD), on the single -dose PK of palbocic lib (125 mg) was 
evaluated in 12  healthy fasted subjects (Study A548 1016 ). Median palbociclib plasma concent rations were 
higher  in the presence of itraconazole than those in th e absence of itraconazole . Palbociclib mean plasma AUC 
from time 0 to infinity (AUC inf ) and C max values in creased approximately 87% and 34%, respectively, when 
administered in combination with itraconazole  compared to when administered alone. Therefore, c oncomitant 
administration of agents known to be strong inhibitors of CYP3A isoenzymes ( such as  ketoconazole, 
miconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, diltiazem, 
verapamil, indinavir, saquinavir, riton avir, nelfinavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, and 
grapefruit juice) should be avoided.  
 
Pharmacokinetic data are available from a rifampin DDI study where the effect of multiple dosing of a potent 
CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (600 mg QD), on the single -dose PK of palbociclib (125 mg) was evaluated in 15 
healthy fasted subjects (Study A5481017). Median palbociclib plasma concentrations were substantially lower 
in the presence of rifampin than those in the absence of rifampin. Palbocicli b mean plasma AUC from time 0 to 
infinity (AUC inf ) and C max values decreased approximately 85% and 70%, respectively, when administered in 
combination with rifampin compared to when administered alone. Therefore, co -administration of palbociclib 
with stro ng CYP3A inducers (such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifabutin, rifapentin, 
clevidipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and St. John’s Wort) should be avoided.  
 
Palbociclib and PF -[ADDRESS_1127234] of multiple dosing of palbociclib (125 mg QD) 
on the single -dose PK of a sensitive CYP3A4/5 probe substrate, oral midazolam (2 mg), was evaluated in 26 
healthy women of non -childbearing po tential (Study A5481012). When midazolam was administered with 
palbociclib 125 mg QD at steady -state, the mean midazolam plasma C max and AUC inf values increased 
   
Page | 12  approximately 38% and 61%, respectively, as compared with those determined after administration  of 
midazolam alone. These results indicate that palbociclib is a weak time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A.  
 
Palbociclib Dose Rationale  
 
Palbociclib has been tested in a Phase 1 dose escalation Study (A5481001) in 74 patients with advanced cancer. 
Two dosing schedules were evaluated: Schedule 3/1 (3 weeks on treatment/1 week off treatment) and Schedule 
2/1 (2 weeks on treatment/1 week off treatment). All dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in this study were 
related to myelosuppression and mainly c onsisted of Grade [ADDRESS_1127235] common non -
hematological adverse events included fatigue, anemia, diarrhea, constipation, vomiti ng and dyspnea, all with 
mild to moderate severity. A greater proportion of patients on the 2/1 schedule had treatment -related TEAEs 
during and after Cycle 1 than patients on the 3/[ADDRESS_1127236] to the 2 dosing schedules, both during and after Cycle 1. One 
partial response (PR) was reported in a patient with testicular cancer. A total of 13/37 patients treated with 
Schedule 3/1 evaluable for efficacy experienced sta ble disease (SD), including 6 patients with SD lasting 40 
weeks or longer. One of these patients was a woman with ER+ breast cancer who had previously received 7 
lines of treatment for her disease. This patient remained on treatment for 80 weeks (7 cycles at 50 mg/d and 13 
cycles at 75 mg/d) and eventually discontinued treatment due to disease progression. Based on the relatively 
improved safety profile of Schedule 3/1, and the efficacy results from this study, the Schedule 3/1 has been 
selected for further  clinical development and the RP2D for this schedule was determined to be 125 mg/day. This 
schedule and associated RP2D was further explored in combination with letrozole in the Phase I/II study in 
patients with advanced breast cancer described below.  
 
Palbociclib Clinical Data  
 
A phase II study with single agent palbociclib in [ADDRESS_1127237] cancer  was reported at the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [ADDRESS_1127238] completed cycle 1 [30].  
Palbociclib is given at 125 mg orally, days 1 - 21 of a 28 -day cycle. Of the 28 women, 18 (64%) women are 
HR+/HER2 -, 2 (7%) are HR+/HER2+ and 8 (29%) HR -/HER2 -negative. 90% had prior chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease (median 3 lines); 78% had prior hormonal therapy (median 2 lines).  Grade 3/4 toxicities were 
limited to transient neutropenia (n=14; 50%) and thrombocytopenia (n=6; 21%). One epi[INVESTIGATOR_814307] a patient with six previous chemotherapy regimens. All other toxicities were grade 1/2. 
Treatment was in terrupted in 7 (25%) and dose reduced in 13 (46%) patients for cytopenias; 27/28 patients 
discontinued study for disease progression. (PR + SD >6 months) was as follows: 4 patients (23%) in 
HR+/HER2 -negative (n=18), 1 (50%) in HR+/HER2+ (n=2), 1 (13%) in H R-negative/HER2 -negative (n=8). In 
conclusion, therapy with palbociclib alone is well -tolerated, and demonstrates clinical benefit in patients with 
all subtypes of breast cancer and despi[INVESTIGATOR_196314] - and chemotherapy. Translational 
studies examining molecular predictors of response are in progress.  
 
A randomized, multicenter active -controlled Phase I/II Study (A5481003) was designed to assess the efficacy, 
safety and PK of letrozole 2.5 mg QD in combination with palbociclib 125 mg QD (s chedule 3/1) versus single 
agent letrozole 2.[ADDRESS_1127239] -line treatment of ER+/ HER2 -negative advanced breast cancer in 
postmenopausal women. Letrozole was selected as the active control based on its worldwide approval and use 
as standard of care  for the first -line hormonal treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast 
cancer.  
Study A5481003 included a limited Phase I portion, aimed at confirming the safety and tolerability of the 
combination and excluding a PK interaction with the co mbination, and a randomized Phase II portion aimed at 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of letrozole in combination with palbociclib when compared to letrozole 
alone in the first -line treatment of postmenopausal patients with ER+/HER2 -negative advanced br east cancer. 
   
Page | 13  The Phase II portion, also called PALOMA -1, consisted of 2 parts. In Part 1, patient selection was based only 
on ER/HER2 status. In Part 2, patients were prospectively selected also taking into account tumor CCND1 
amplification and/or p16 loss . A total of 177 patients were enrolled in the study. Twelve (12) were enrolled in 
the Phase 1 portion and 165 (66 and 99 in Part 1 and 2, respectively) were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion. 
Results from the Phase 1 portion indicated no PK interaction betw een palbociclib and letrozole. The RP2D was 
determined to be 125 mg QD on Schedule 3/1 (3 weeks continuous treatment followed by 1week off treatment) 
in combination with letrozole 2.5 mg QD continuously. PRs were reported for 3 (33%) out of 9 patients with  
measurable disease (3 had bone -only disease). Another 5 patients (42%) had stable disease for ≥ 6 months and 
the clinical benefit rate (PR + SD ≥ 6 months) was 67%. Eight (8) patients discontinued from the study due to 
disease progression, including [ADDRESS_1127240] been conducted. The results of the interim 
analyses showed consistent trend of clinically meaning ful improvements in PFS (primary endpoint). In the first 
interim analysis (Part 1; N=66), the median PFS for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was 18.2 months versus 
5.7 months for the letrozole alone arm (HR=0.35; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.72; p=0.006). The second  interim analysis 
(N=165) continued to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS (26.1 vs. 7.5 months, 
respectively; HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.63; p <0.001) [22]. More recently , the final analysis  demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm (20.2 months) versus the 
letrozole arm (10.2 months) with haz ard ratio (HR=0.488; 95% CI: 0.319, 0.748 , p=0.0004 ). These results 
indicate that the combination of palbociclib with letrozole is well tolerated with a safety profile similar to that 
seen with either palbociclib or letrozole when administered alone. The m ost frequently reported treatment -
related adverse events included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and fatigue. There were no cases of febrile 
neutropenia reported to date in this study. Overall, 8 patients in the combination arm were discontinued from 
the study treatment due to an adverse event, of which 5 were considered treatment -related (grade 3 neutropenia 
[n=4] and ischemic colitis) and 1 patient from the letrozole alone arm. Additionally, the combination 
demonstrated antitumor activity, which was con sistent with the sensitivity of ER+ breast cancer observed in the 
preclinical models.  
 
2.2.2 Bazedoxifene  
 
Bazedoxifene is a n orally available indole -based selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with two 
phenyl rings that serve as the core-binding unit. Its structural characteristics differ from those of tamoxifen and 
raloxifene. Bazedoxifene  (20 mg)  is approved  in the European Union for the treatment of post -menopausal 
osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture. Bazedoxifene h as not been approved in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Bazedoxifene emerged from in-vitro  screens that selected for compounds that bound to ER and competitively 
displaced 17β -estradiol, inhibited estrogen action in estrogen models and did not manifest ERα agonist acti vity 
in contexts where tamoxifen functions as an agonist, as in the endometrium.  
 
Based on in-vitro  studies, bazedoxifene does not stimulate MCF7 breast cancer cell proliferation and suppresses 
breast cancer cell proliferation induced by 17β -estradiol in a  dose dependent manner [23]. In animal studies, 
treatment with bazedoxifene preserved bone mass and bone strength and decreased levels of bone turnover 
markers. In immature rats, bazedoxifene protected against estrogen -stimulated increases in uterine wet weight. 
In mice it was a more  effective antagonist against conjugated estrogen induced stimulation of the mammary 
gland compared to other SERMs [24] 
 
Bazedoxifene Preclinical Data  
 
Preclinical studies show that bazedoxifene inhibits estrogen induced cell growth in ER+ breast cancer cell lines 
with an IC50 of 0.19nM. Th is inhibition is due to antagonistic effect of bazedoxifine on ER, as the growth 
   
Page | [ADDRESS_1127241] on these resistant cells but requires a higher concentration. 
Additionally, bazedoxifene induces G1 -phase cell cycle block by [CONTACT_814344] D1 levels [25].  
Breast cancer xenograft studies showed that bazedoxifene inhibits tumor growth and reduced tumor doubling 
time. Similarly, in a tamoxifen resistant breast cancer xenograft model in which growth is stimulated by 
[CONTACT_15004], bazedoxifene treatment reversed th e tamoxifen stimulation of these tumors and led to tumor 
regression [26]. 
 
Both in-vitro  and in-vivo studies show that bazedoxifene has SERD activity, which is proteasome dependent. 
Furthermore, in the presence of bazedo xifene, ER mRNA levels do not increase in response to increased ER 
degradation, resulting in sustained knock -down of ER over time in the absence of a feedback mechanism to 
restore receptor levels [26]. 
 
Bazedoxifene Phar macokinetic (PK) data  
 
Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in healthy post -menopausal women. In one study, women received 
multiple doses of 5, 20 and 40 mg bazedoxifene daily in a randomized crossover fashion for 14 days. The 
maximum concentration (C max) was dose dependent and was reached within 1 -2 hours. The half -life of 
bazedoxifene was 28 hours. Bazedoxifene exhibited linear pharmacokinetics. Plasma concentrations were 
approximately double at steady state, which was reached by [CONTACT_4475] 7. Protein binding was greater than 99%. 
Results from a metabolic disposition study showed that the major route of excretion was feces (85%), with less 
than 1% excreted in the urine. The major metabolic pathway was glucuronidation, with little or no cytochrome 
P450 metabolis m. 
 
Bazedoxifene Dose Rationale  
 
Bazedoxifene has been tested in a [ADDRESS_1127242] -menopausal women. Conjugated estrogen (0.625  mg )/ medroxy -progesterone 
actetate (2.5) was the active control. Bazedoxifene doses in the first part included daily 2.5 mg, 5mg, 10mg and 
20mg and in the second part daily 20mg  (n=60) , 30mg  (n=60)  and 40mg  (n=60)  [27]. Endometrial thickness was 
monitored closely and doses 2.5 -20mg/ day resulted in no significant endometrial thickness changes compared to 
placebo. The 30 and 40mg/day doses were associated with a decrease in endometrial thic kness, which was 
inversely related to dose. None of the endometrial biopsy specimens demonstrated endometrial hyperplasia. The 
most commonly reported adverse events were: abdominal pain, headache, breast pain and flu syndrome. One 
possible related serious adverse event was an epi[INVESTIGATOR_814308] a concomitant use of a 
salbutamol inhaler.  
 
A double -blind , placebo -controlled, ascending multiple -dose safety and tolerability study of bazedoxifene was 
conducted  including 107 healthy postmenopausal women  (information from [COMPANY_007]) . Fifteen (15) subjects (12 to 
receive B azedoxifene and 3 to receive placebo) participated in each of the 7 dose groups.  The 7 oral doses of 
Bazedoxifene  were 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, given onc e daily for 30 consecutive days.  One (1) or more 
adverse event s were  reported by 78 (73%) subjects; 10 (77%) who took B azedoxifene  1 mg, 8 (62%) who took 
Bazedoxifene  2.5 mg, 7 (58%) who took B azedoxifene  5 mg, 9 (75%) who took B azedoxifene  10 mg, 9 (75%) 
who took B azedoxifene  20 mg, 10 (83%) who took B azedoxifene  40 mg, 8 (67%) who took B azedoxifene  80 
mg, and 17 (81%) who took placebo.  The majority of adverse event s (82%) were reported as mild and 18% 
were reported as moderate. There were no severe advers e. Of the 78 subjects who reported adverse event s, 43 
(55%) reported adverse event s that were considered as possibly, probably, or definitely drug -related by [CONTACT_1275], and 35 (45%) that were considered as not drug -related.  The most frequently repor ted adverse 
event s were: headache reported by 19 subjects (18%), constipation reported by 13 (12%) subjects, accidental 
   
Page | 15  injury reported by 10 (9%) subjects, and dizziness, pharyngitis, and nausea, each reported by 7 (7%) subjects. 
No overall differences be tween treatment groups and no dose -related differences in the frequency were 
observe d. 
 A 2-year phase III, double blind, randomized study was performed to study the efficacy of bazedoxifene in the 
prevention of osteoporosis. In this study bazedoxifene was  found to significantly prevent bone loss. A total of 
[ADDRESS_1127243] -menopausal women with osteoporosis risk were randomized to receive daily bazedoxifene 10  
(n=321) , 20 (n=322)  or 40mg  (n=319), raloxifene 60mg or placebo. All doses of bazedoxifene were generally well 
tolerated and exhibited a safety profile generally similar to that of placebo. The most common adverse events in all 
treatment arms were headache, infection, arthralgia, pain, hot flashes and back pain. Hot flashes were more 
common in all doses of bazedoxifene (ranging from 19.6 -24.1%) compared to placebo (14.2%), but similar to 
raloxifene. Four deaths were reported during the study and two deaths were reported after withdrawal or 
completion of the study. Five of the deaths were not considered related to the administered treatment. One death in 
the bazedoxifene 40mg arm, a subject experienced a pulmonary embolism during a prolonged air flight 30 days 
after study completion, was consi dered by [CONTACT_814345]. There were no cases 
of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer in the bazedoxifene groups. There were significant increases in 
triglyceride levels in all bazedoxifene treated arms, but th e number of subjects that developed hypertriglyceridemia 
was low (0.3 -1.6%) [28]. 
 
A 3-year randomized phase III, double blind, randomized study was conducted in women with osteoporosis to 
assess  the efficacy of bazedoxifene in reducing new vertebral fracture risk. A total of 7492 women were 
randomized to daily bazedoxifene 20mg (n=1886) or 40mg  (n=1872) , raloxifene 60mg or placebo. Bazedoxifene 
was shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures.  Both doses of bazedoxifene were well tolerated. The incidence 
of adverse events, serious adverse events, and deaths were generally similar to that in the placebo group. The 
incidence of venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis/ pulmonary embol ism) was higher in the 
treatment arms compared with the placebo arm (bazedoxifene 20 mg, 0.7%; bazedoxifene 40mg, 0.6%, raloxifene 
60mg 0.5% ; placebo 0.3%).  The frequency of the development of breast cancer was lower in the bazedoxifene 
treatment arms rel ative to the raloxifene and placebo arms [29].  
 
The 40mg dose of bazedoxifene was chosen for this study given the extensive data of the safety of this dose in 
over 2000 patients , as described in the studies above, and the pre -clinical evidence of improved ER degradation 
and antagonistic activity with increasing doses of bazedoxifene (figure 1). Furthermore, several recent clinical 
studies have shown, that in metastatic disease, i mproved ER inhibition by [CONTACT_814346]  [30, 31]. Taken 
together, the se studies suggest that a hi gher dose of bazedoxifene could have increased efficacy with out added 
toxicity.  
  
2.3 Rationale  
 
Combination of bazedoxifene with palbociclib:  The combination of palbociclib and letrozole is a very 
promising regimen for the treatment of metastatic HR+ breast cancer. However, many patients with ER+ breast 
cancer receive an aromatase inhibitor as part of adjuvant hormonal therapy or as a single agent as first line 
treatment in the metastatic setting. A combination of palbociclib with an endocrine treatment of a different class 
is lacking and may be superior.  
 
Fulvestrant is an endocrine treatment that is a SERD and has a different mechanism of action compared to 
aromatase inhibitors. Fulvestrant is an approved drug for the treatment of aromatase inhibitor refract ory disease 
and the combination of palbociclib with fulvestrant is a potential regimen. However, the response rate to 
fulvestrant in the setting of refractory disease is approximately 10%, similar to exemestane, as a second line 
steroidal aromatase inhibit or. The low efficacy of fulvest rant is likely not to due to it s mechanism of action but 
   
Page | 16  rather, the pharmacokinetic properties of fulvestrant, which is administered by [CONTACT_80626] , is the 
limiting factor. Indeed, despi[INVESTIGATOR_814309], drug concentrations measured in the vicinity of 
the tumor were found to be insufficient to saturate ER [32]. In addition, positron emission tomography studies 
confirmed poor delivery of fulvestrant to the  tumor. Higher doses of fulvestrant were shown to be associated 
with improved progression free survival and the 500mg dose of fulvestrant is now the standard of care [31]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_814310], it is likely, that the full therapeuti c potential of SERD 
treatment has not been revealed with this drug.  
 
Bazedoxifene is an orally bioavailable SERM with SERD activity [33,34]. In-vitro  and in-vivo studies show that 
bazedoxifene inhibits cellular proliferation and tumor growth similarly to fulvestrant. The bioavailability of 
bazedoxifene is likely pertinent to evaluate the full potential of a SERD in the treatment of refractory disease. In 
addition, bazedoxefine was shown to directly inhibit cyclin D1 and therefore bazedoxifene may potentiat e the 
activity of palbociclib [34].  
 
We confirmed that bazedoxifene functions both as an ER antagonist and ER degrader. As shown below, we 
detected similar ER degradation levels when bazedoxif ene was compared to fulvestrant. In contrast, when we 
looked at the inhibition of ER activity by [CONTACT_814347]7 cell stably infected with an ERE -luciferace promoter -
reporter construct, bazedoxifene displayed improved ER inhibition comp ared to fulvest rant (fig.1). In addition, 
our preliminary data in three differe nt ER+ breast cancer cell lines show that single agent fulve strant and 
bazedoxifene alone inhibit cell growth comparably. However, the combination of palbociclib with either 
fulvestrant or bazedoxifene inhibits cell growth in a synergistic manner, with the  latter combination being 
significantly superior. We also tested the growth effects of the different treatments in long -term estrogen 
deprived (LTED) cell lines. In th is cell line that model s resistance to aromatase inhibitors, we saw that the 
combination of palbociclib with bazedoxifene also had synergistic activity.  
 
2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
 
The correlative studies proposed in this protocol are exploratory and hypothesis -generating. Promising 
hypotheses may be further explored and/or validated in f uture studies.  
 
• To explore whether high levels of cyclin D1, Rb and/or phosphorylated Rb or low levels of p16, p27 are 
associated with objective response  
• To explore whether patients harboring a ESR1  mutation respond to the combination of palbociclib with 
bazedoxifene.  
• To explore if there is an association between genetic alterations most frequently found in hormone 
receptor positive breast cancer and objective response or overall survival by [CONTACT_814348] (NGS) in archival metastatic tumor samples and/or prospectively collected 
metastatic samples.  
• Study mechanisms of resistance by [CONTACT_814337], Cyclin D1, phosphorylated Rb and 
the Cdk inhibitors p21, p27 and  p16, EGFR, and phosphorylated AKT as well as targeted NGS of 
tumors attained after the development of resistance.  
• To explore the sensitivity of plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) and droplet digital PCR  (ddPCR) to detect 
mutations in metastatic breast cancer.  
• To analyze if changes in levels of mutations as determined by [CONTACT_814349] t.

2.4.2 ESR1  Mutations  
 
We and other groups recently identified  ESR1 mutations in approximately 15% of patients with metastatic ER+ 
breast cancer. In all studies, the ESR1  mutations are located in a hot spot in the ligand -binding domain [5 -9]. In 
our study, ESR1  mutations were not detected in primary ER+ breast cancer s and all patients harboring a 
mutation received at least one line of hormonal therapy. Additionally, we found a correlation between the 
mutation frequency and number of treatment lines in the metastatic setting; patients who received at least 3 lines 
of treatment in the metastatic setting had a 20% mutation frequency. Our pre -clinical data in ER+ breast can cer

Page | [ADDRESS_1127246] the clonal selection of ESR1 mutations that render endocrine 
resistance in metastatic ER+ breast cancer.  
 
We hypothesize that the combination of bazedoxifene and palbociclib may be effective in overcoming treatment 
resistance mediated by [CONTACT_814350]1  mutations. This hypothesis stems from pre -clinical data suggesting that SERDs 
can inhibit tumor growth  driven by  [CONTACT_606866]1, but higher doses are required. Given the oral bioavailability of 
bazedoxifene, this might be achieved with this agent. In addition, since cyclin D1 is one of the key proteins 
regulated by [CONTACT_814351], it is an attractive targe t for overcoming resistance 
mediated ESR1  mutations. As shown in Figure 3, employing MCF7 cells lines with doxycycline induced ESR1  
mutations, we confirmed that the mutations confer relative resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant. In contrast, 
ER mutant c ells remain sensitive to bazedoxifene, further supporting the rationale of this study.

PIK3CA, TP53, MAP3K1, MAP2K4, GATA3, MLL3, CDH1, PTEN, NCOR1, FOXA1, ERBB2 . The functional 
roles of these mutations in the developme nt and progression of metastatic ER+ breast cancer have not been 
elucidated yet  and whole exome sequencing studies of metastatic breast cancer are limited . Therefore, in this 
study we will perform whole exome sequencing of archival primary and metastatic s amples as well as 
prospectively collected metastatic samples, in order to study the associations between muta tions and response to

patients who develope d endocrine resistance. In this study we will also study the ESR1  mutations in the tissue 
specimens to test if there is an association between these mutations and response.   As part of this study, we will

Tumor genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_814311] -free plasma DNA (cfDNA) has the p otential to enable non -invasive assessment of

- Patients with a breast mass or axillary lymph node a menable to an image -guided core biops y 
are also required t o undergo a baseline biopsy and a biopsy at the time of disease progression 
as part of this protocol.  
- Patients with malignant ascites fluid or a malignant pleural effusion of sufficient volume to be 
amenable to tap (either in -office or  image -guided) are also required to undergo a baselin e tap 
and a tap at the ti me of disease progression  as part of this protocol.  
   
Page | 22  - Patients who undergo a research biopsy procedure for the purpose of this protocol, and in 
whom inadequate tissue is obtained, are still eligible and are not required to undergo a repeat 
biopsy in order to enter the study.  
- Patients will be approached during cycle 1 about providing an optional tissue sample at that 
time; however, this biopsy will be optional.  
 
• Patients with “accessible disease”  
 
- Patients with sites felt to be accessible to an image -guided or incisional biopsy in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_814313]’s treating o ncologist and physician performing the procedure, and not meeting 
the criteria for “easily accessible disease” as described in Section 3.1. 14.1, are required to 
undergo a baseline biopsy as part of this protocol. Such sites may include, but are not limited 
to: liver, lymph nodes, soft tissue, lung, chest wall, and bone.  Cycle [ADDRESS_1127253] institution al guidelines.   
- If a biopsy requires general anesthesia, then it is only allowed if acquisition of tissue is 
necessary for clinical reasons (i.e. is clinically indicated), and excess tissue that would 
otherwise have been discarded is then used for research  purposes. If a biopsy requires general 
anesthesia, then a biopsy of that site for research purposes only, without a coexisting clinical 
indication is not allowed on this protocol.  
- Patients who undergo a research biopsy procedure for the purpose of this pr otocol, and in 
whom inadequate tissue is obtained, are still eligible and are not required to undergo a repeat 
biopsy in order to enter the study.  
- Some patients may have had a clinically indicated biopsy upon recent disease progression. No 
additional pre -treatment biopsy is required if that specimen can be used for the correlative 
studies described in this protocol.  
- Patients will be approached at the time of progression about providing an optional tissue 
sample at that time; however, the time of progression  biopsy will be optional.  
 
• Other patients  
 
 Patients who do not have biopsy -accessible disease are not required to undergo a biopsy as part of 
study participation.  
 
In addition, patients who are being treated with therapeutic doses of anticoagulant(s), are not required 
to undergo a biopsy as part of study participation. If it is felt clinically appropriate despi[INVESTIGATOR_28082] (i.e. a skin punch biopsy, etc) by [CONTACT_1963], a biopsy is allowed, it is simply 
not required.  
 
The sites of metastatic disease and reason that the disease is not biopsy -accessible should be 
documented in the medical record and case report form(s).  
 
Patients who do not undergo baseline biopsy must have their study participation approved by [CONTACT_814356] l PI [INVESTIGATOR_814314]. Only patients who have biopsy inaccessible disease may 
enter the study without the requirement for baseline biopsy.

Highly  Effective N on-Hormonal Contraception Methods of birth control which result in a low 
failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are considered highly -
effective forms of contraception. The following non -hormonal methods of contracep tion are acceptable:  
• True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the   patient. 
[Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contrace ption].  
• Male sterilization (with appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in 
the ejaculate). For female patients, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner.  
 
 OR 
 
Effective Non -Hormonal Contraception  
Alternatively two of the following effective forms of contraception may be used instead:  
• Placement of non -hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  
Consideration should be given to the type of device being used, as there is higher failure rates 
quoted for certain types, e.g., steel or copper wire.  
• Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.  
• Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermi cidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.  The use of barrier contraceptive s should always be 
supplemented with the use of spermicide.  
 
The following should be noted:  
 
• Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not highly 
effective forms of contraception. Therefore, the use of additional spermicides does confer 
additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  
• However, spermicides alone ar e ineffective at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate 
is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073]. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be 
used alone.  
   
Page | 24   
It should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required. A double b arrier method is 
acceptable, which is defined as condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/ vault caps) with 
spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream /suppository. Premenopausal women who have been on a GnRH agonist 
for at least [ADDRESS_1127256] for the duration of protocol treatment. Such patients should be counseled that GnRH

4. REGISTRATION  AND RECRUITMENT  PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 Recruitment Procedures  
 
To enhance accrual and awarenes s of the trial, the study team will review clinic schedules and patient lists of 
medical oncologists at DF/HCC to identify eligible patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.  
 
Providers will be contact[CONTACT_814358], and subsequently approach the patient about participating in the trial.  
 
4.2 General Guidelines for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office for Clinical Trials 
(QACT) central registration system. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of  protocol therapy. Any 
participant not registered to the protocol before protocol ther apy begins will be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.  
 
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the QACT  
protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 
Following registration, participant s may begin protocol therapy . Issues that would  cause treatment delays 
should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant does not receive protocol 
therapy following registration, the pa rticipant’s registration on the study  must  be canceled . Notify the QACT 
Registr ar of registration cancellations  as soon as possible.   
 
4.3 Registration Process for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 
   
Page | [ADDRESS_1127259] registration staff is accessible on Monday through Friday, from 8:00 AM to 5:[ADDRESS_1127260] registration line at 617 -632-3761 and follow the instructions for registering 
participants after hours.  
 
The registration proced ures are as follows:  
 
• Obtain written informed consent from the participant prior  to the performance of any protocol  specific 
procedures or assessments.  
 
• Complete the QACT protocol -specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment documented 
in the participant ’s medical  record and/or  research chart. To be eligible for registration to the 
protocol , the participant must meet all inclusion and exclusion criterion  as described in the 
protocol and reflected on the eligibility checklist.  
 
Reminder : Confirm eligibility for ancillary studies at the same time as eligibility for a  treatment 
protocol. Registration to both treatment and ancillary protocols will not be completed if eligibility 
requirements are not met for all studies.  
 
• Fax the eligibility checklist(s) and all pages of the consent form(s) to the QACT at 617 -632-2295.  For 
Phase I protocols, attach participant dose level assignment confirmation from the sponsor.  
 
• The QACT Registrar will (a) review the  eligibility  checklist , (b) register the participant on the protocol, 
and (c) randomize the participant when  applicable.  
 
• An email  confirmation of the registration and/or randomization will be sent to the Overall PI, study 
coordinator(s) from the Lead Site, treating investigato r and registering person immediately following the 
registration and/or randomization.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Bazedoxifene and palbociclib will be supplied every 4 weeks, with 28 consecutive days defined as a treatment 
cycle. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Expected toxicities and potential risks as well as 
dose modifications for palbociclib are described in Section 6 ( Expected Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose 
Modification). No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_163854]’s malignancy.

5.3 Agent Administration  
 
5.3.1 Palbociclib  
 
Palbociclib 125 mg should be taken orally, once per day, with food. If a dose is vomited, a  replacement dose 
should NOT be taken. If a dose is missed, and it i s less than 6 hours from  usual time of dosing, then patients 
may take that dose. Otherwise that dose should be skipped  and NOT retaken; patients should resume regular 
dosing the following day.  Patients who  inadvertently take [ADDRESS_1127264] skip the next day’s 
dose.  Patients should be  instructed to record daily administration of the study drugs in a drug diary  
(Appendix D).  Treatment is continuous daily for 21 days, and then 7 days off, to c omplete a 28 day cycle.   
 
On days when patient is scheduled for a clinic visit, the patient may take the oral medications at  home or in the 
clinic. In addition, patients will bring pi[INVESTIGATOR_345864], and pi[INVESTIGATOR_345865]: Patie nts 
will be required to return all bottles of palbociclib as well as the completed drug diary at each study visit for 
drug accountability. Drug accountability for palbociclib will be performed at each study visit prior to dispensing 
drug supply for the nex t cycle(s). The number of remaining capsules/tablets will be documented and recorded.  
 
To be considered compliant, each study patient must have taken at least 80% of the planned  number of doses of 
primary therapy based on the number of days of actual dose administration.  
 
5.3.2 Bazedoxifene  
 
Bazedoxifene 40mg (2 tabs of 20mg) should be taken orally, once per day.  If a dose is vomited, a replacement 
dose should NOT be taken.  If a dose is missed, and it is less than 6 hours from usual time of dosing, then 
patients may take that dose.  Otherwis e that dose should be skipped and NOT retaken; patients should resume 
regular dosing the following day.  Patients who inadvertently take [ADDRESS_1127265] skip the next 
day’s dose.  Patients should be instructed to record daily administration of the study drugs in a drug diary 
(Appendix D). 
 
Treatment is continuous daily to complete a 28 day cycle. Ordering of bazedoxifene self -administration relative 
to palbociclib self -administration is as per patient preference.  
 
On days when patient is sche duled for a clinic visit, the patient may take the oral medications at  home or in the 
clinic.  
 
In addition, patients will bring pi[INVESTIGATOR_814315], and pi[INVESTIGATOR_814316]: Patients 
will be required to return all blister card s of bazedoxifene as well as the completed drug diary at each study visit 
for drug accountability. Drug accountability for bazedoxifene will be performed at each study visit prior to 
dispensing drug supply for the next cycle(s). The number of remaining cap sules/tablets will be documented and 
recorded.  
 
To be considered compliant, each study patient must have taken at least 80% of the planned  number of doses of 
primary therapy based on the number of days of actual dose administration.

Page | 29  name [CONTACT_18467] (or trade name [CONTACT_814370]) must be specified along with the duration of treatment 
and indication for  use. If conco mitant medication/therapy is administered for an adverse event (AE), 
investigators  will record that AE on the AE page of the eCRF.  
 
Supportive care medications are allowed at any time on trial. Specifically, the following agents  are permitted:  
• Antiemetics  
• Antidiarrheal therapy  
• Antiallergic measures such as corticosteroids and antihistamines  
• Agents to assist in the management of hot flashes or headaches (NSAIDs,  gabapentin, duloxetine, 
venlafaxine, citalopram, etc)  
• Treatment with either a bisphosphonate or d enosumab when bone lesions are  documented (as non -target 
lesions) is allowed for the treatment of bone metastases.  The first dose should be given prior to the start 
of protocol therapy. Oral  bisphosphonate treatment is allowed for patients with a low bone mineral 
density.  Patients already receiving bisphosphonate at the time of study entry can continue the  treatment.  
• Growth Factors : Patients may receive erythropoietin while on study, at the discretion of the patient’s  
treating physician. The use of G -CSF/GM -CSF should generally be limited to  clinical scenarios such as 
febrile neutropenia or active infection, and should not be  administered on a chronic basis to maintain 
neutrophil counts as part of ongoing  therapy. The use of platelet growth factors are speci fically 
prohibited on this  protocol. Please consult the Principal Investigator [CONTACT_38450]. Investigational  
growth factors are not permitted on this study.  
 
The use of concurrent investigational or other antitumor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54880]. Missed dose s of either 
endocrine therapy or palbociclib are not made up.  
 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers  are not allowed on study. Palbociclib is metabolized to  multiple metabolites 
in a qualitatively similar manner in rat, dog and human liver microsomes.  In vitro, Palbociclib is primarily 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 enzymes. Co -administration with  drugs that are CYP3A inhibitors and inducers may 
change the plasma concentrations of  palbociclib in humans. The concurrent use of CYP3A inhibitors, includi ng 
amprenavir,  atazanavir, boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin,  
fosamprenavir, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], mibefradil, miconazole,  nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, t elaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil, voriconazole, and grapefruit, grapefruit 
juice or any product containing grapefruit, are not allowed in the study. The concurrent use of CYP3A inducers, 
including carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  felbamate, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, primido ne, rifabutin, rifampin,  rifanpi[INVESTIGATOR_2513],  
rifapentin, and  St. John’s wort, are not allowed in the study. This medication list may also be found in  
Appendix C. 
 
Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers and CYP3A substrates is allowable on study,  however 
precau tion should be exercised for use of any concomitant medication.  
 
Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inducers  are not allowed in this study. Bazedoxifene is a 
UGT substrate. Co-administration with drugs  that are UGT inducers may change the pl asma concentrations of 
bazedoxifene. The concurrent use of the UGT inducers carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], dabrafenib, eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379736], 
phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin are not allowed in the study.  
 
The use of herbal medicine is not recommended during protoc ol treatment.  
 
Surgery is allowed during protocol therapy, however it is suggested to avoid nadir of counts at  time of surgery. 
Patients pursuing surgery must hold palbociclib and bazedoxifene therapy [ADDRESS_1127267] occurred.  
   
Page | 30   
Proton pump inhibitors  (PPI)  may be taken while on study, however it is recommended that the  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_345870] 
12 hours from the time of palbociclib administration. If needed, alternative antacid  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_814317] H2 -receptor antagonists and locally acting antacids. H2 -receptor antagonists should be administered 
with a staggered dosing regimen (twice daily). The  dosing of palb ociclib should occur at least [ADDRESS_1127268] 2 hours before or after palbociclib administration.  
 
5.5 Criteria for Taking a P articipant Off Protocol Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease  progression and tolerance. In the 
absence of treatment delays due to adverse events,  treatment may continue until one of the following criteria 
applies:  
 
• Disease progression.  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents furt her administration of treatment.  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s).  
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the ora l medication regimen 
and/or document ation requirements.  
• Participant decide s to withdraw from the study.  
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participan t unacceptable for further 
treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021].  
 
At the time the patient i s taken off study treatment, alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
 
A QACT Treatment Ended/Off Study Form will be filled out when a participant is removed from protocol 
therapy. This form can be found on the QACT website or obtai ned from the QACT registration staff.  
 
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, participating investigators  must immediately notify the 
Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_814372] at 617 -632- 3352, pager #[ZIP_CODE] (Email: rjeselsohn@partner s.org).

specific case report form (CRF).  
 
Participants who are removed from study treatment will continue to be followed for  long-term outcomes for up 
to 2 years as specified in Section 5.6.  
 
Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply:  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent for data submission

form can be found on the QACT website or obtained from the QACT registration staff.  
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made as indicated in the following table(s). The descriptions and grading 
scales foun d in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will 
be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from 
the CTEP website  
 http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  
 
All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_143026], through the study and until [ADDRESS_1127270]. 
Participants continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be  contact[CONTACT_814360] i s deemed irreversible.  
 
6.1 Toxicity Management  
 
6.1.1 Toxicity management – Palbociclib  
 
Every effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.  
However, in the event of significant treatment -related toxicity, administration of p albociclib may need to be 
adjusted as described in section 6.2.3. In the event treatment interruption is deemed necessary for either 
palbociclib or the endocrine therapy, treatment with the other medication will continue as planned.  
 
If the retreatment par ameters (see section 6.2. 1) are met within [ADDRESS_1127271] not been met after 3 weeks of dose interruption (including the scheduled 1 
week off treatment), the patient should permanently discontinue palbociclib and bazedoxifene treatment.  
 
Patients discontinuing palbociclib and/or bazedo xifene treatment due to treatment -related toxicity will come off 
study . 
 
6.1.2 Toxicity management – Bazedoxifene  
 
No dose reduction for bazedoxifene is permitted, but dosing interruptions are allowed (see  section 6.2). 
Treatment interruptions for up to 3 cumula tive weeks for bazedoxifene related toxicities or personal reasons are 
allowed as per the investigator’s best medical judgment. Patients discontinuing due to treatment -related toxicity 
will discontinue protocol therapy and come off study.  
 
6.2 Dose Modificati ons/Delays  
 
In the event of significant treatment -related toxicity, palbociclib dosing may be interrupted or  delayed and/or 
reduced as described below. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst 
toxicity observed. P atients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence of any adverse sign 
or symptom.  
   
Page | 32   
6.2.1 Palbociclib Dosing Interruptions/Delays  
 
Patients experiencing the following adverse events should have their treatment of palbociclib  
interrupted/delayed until criteria for retreatment are met:  
• Uncomplicated Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm3); 
• Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm3) associated with a documented infection or  
• fever ≥38.5 °C, 100.4 °F; 
• Grade 2 or higher  thrombocytopenia (Platelet < 75,000/mm3); 
• Grade ≥3 non -hematologic toxicity (including, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and  
• hypertension only if persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_4570]);  
• Grade 2 non -hematologic toxicity persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_814318]  
• lasting more than 3 weeks;  
• Grade 3 QTc prolongation (QTc ≥[ADDRESS_1127272] two separate ECGs);  
• In case of concurrent > 3x ULN ALT and 2x ULN Total Bilirubin, palbociclib and bazedoxifene will be 
permanently discontinued.  
 
Patients should not hold or discontinue palbociclib for side effects potentially or likely related to concomitant 
bazedoxifene as per the investigator’s judgment.   Appropriate follow up assessments should be performed until 
adequate recovery occurs as assessed by [CONTACT_814361].  
 
Missed doses are not made up. When the adverse event resolves, the cycle will continue as scheduled. The need 
for a dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption should be based on the criteria defined in Dose 
Reductions Section unless expressly agreed otherwise following discussion between the investigator and the 
principal investigator . If a dose reduction is applied, the patient may need to return to the clinic to receive new 
drug supply.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1127273] been met:  
• Platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 
• ANC ≥1000/mm 3 and no fever  
• Any persistent grade 2, grade [ADDRESS_1127274] recovered to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline.  
• Only if treatment was held for QTc prolongation: QTc <480 msec and potential  reversible causes (eg, 
electrolyte imbalance, concomitant medications known to prolong QTc) corrected. If QTc remains

investigator ’s best medical judgment u ntil QTc ≤480 msec.  
 
If a treatment delay results from decline in hematologic parameters, the frequency of blood count assessments 
should be adjusted as clinically indicated.  If the retreatment parameters are met within 3 weeks of treatment 
interruption or  cycle delay,  palbociclib may be resumed. Please refer to Dose Reductions Section for adverse 
events  requiring dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption.  
 
Cycles should be 28 days long even if the start of a new cycle is delayed.

treatment), the patient should be removed from the study . 
 
6.2.3 Dose Reductions  
 
Following dose interruption or cycle delay the palbociclib dose may need to be reduced when  treatment is 
resumed.  
 
No specific dose adj ustments are recommended for Grade 1 or short lasting Grade 2 (<3 weeks)  treatment -
related toxicity. However, investigators should always manage their patients  according to their medical 
judgment based on the particular clinical circumstances.  
 
In case of a Grade 2 toxicity lasting for >3 weeks or a Grade 3 toxicity (both assessed in the presence of 
maximum supportive care as judged by [CONTACT_093]), dose reduction is recommended for the subsequent 
cycles. Taking palbociclib a ccording to recommendation (i.e., with food) should be reinforced and confirmed. 
Dose reduction of palbociclib by [CONTACT_30560], and, if needed, by [CONTACT_68000] (Table 1) may be 
recommended depending on type and severity of the toxicity encountered. On ce a dose has been reduced for a 
given patient, all subsequent cycles should be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reduction is 
required. Dose re -escalation is not allowed. Patients requiring more than 2 dose reductions will be discontinu ed 
from the study.

QTc prolongation management  
In the event of QTc prolongation, possible alternative reversible causes such as serum  electrolytes 
abnormalities, or usage of concomitant medications with the potential to prolong the  QTc interval should be 
evaluated. If such reversible causes are identified, then they should be  corrected accordingly (i.e., correction of 
electrolyte abnormalities with supplements to within  normal limits and/or discontinuation (if possible) of 
concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval (see Appendix B). 
 
Recommended dose modifications in the event of QTc prolongation are provided in the Table  below.

6.2.4 Bazedoxifene dose modifications/delays  
  
No dose reduction for bazedoxifene is permitted, but dosing interruptions are allowed.  If bazedoxifene -related 
adverse events occur, they should be managed using standard clinical  practice (e.g. hot flashes can be treated 
with venlafaxine).  
 
If grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurs that the treating investigator feels is related to bazedoxifene, the  study Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_814321].  
 
Treatment interruptions for up to 3 cumulative weeks for bazedoxifene therapy -related toxicities or personal 
reasons  are allowed as per the investigator’s best medical judgment. Palbociclib should not be held during 
bazedoxifene therapy interruption, unless palbociclib is on hold for a separate reason as described in section  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIRE MENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of 
   
Page | 36  reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting  in addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
7.1 Adverse Events Lists  
 
7.1.1 Expected Toxicities  for Palbociclib  
 
The primary anticipated toxicity of palbociclib is neutropenia. In the phase I, dose -escalation  trial of palbociclib 
alone in advanced cancers, neutropenia was the only dose -limiting toxicity  (DLT). Grade 3 neutropenia during 
cycle 1 was observed in 3/22 patients rece iving palbociclib  125 mg PO daily, with no grade 4 neutropenic 
events observed. Based on this result, 125 mg PO daily became the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Other 
hematologic AEs of grade [ADDRESS_1127276] common non -hematologic AEs of grade 3 or greater during cycle 1 were  
fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain (each occurring in 2 of 41 patients). Of note, there were no  complicated 
hematologic AEs documente d, and all hematologic AEs resolved during the off  drug period of a 3 week on/[ADDRESS_1127277] cancer, the only toxicities > grade 3  observed were 
transient neutrope nia (50%) and thrombocytopenia (21%).  In a phase II trial of  palbociclib plus letrozole for 
first-line therapy of hormone receptor positive breast cancer, the  most common AEs reported were neutropenia, 
leukopenia, and fatigue.  The median time to  first trea tment delay for neutropenia was 58 days, and the median 
duration of treatment delay  until recovery was 5 days (range 1 -16 days). ([COMPANY_007] internal data). In general, 
hematologic  abnormalities were adequately managed with standard supportive care, were not c omplicated,  
and resolved during the drug hold with no cumulative toxicity noted.  
 
In the phase I, dose -escalation trial of palbociclib alone in advanced cancers,  QT interval  changes were also 
evaluated in detail. While 26 of 41 patients had a maximum incre ase of <[ADDRESS_1127278] common side effects were: 
hot flashes (20 -24% of patients) and muscle cramps (12%). Most cases of hot flashes were mild to moderate 
and did lead to participant discontinuation from study. There were no safety concerns related to the 
cardiovascular system. The number of thromboembolic e vents was low (<1%) in the bazedoxifene treatment 
arms. There was one death in the bazedoxifene [ADDRESS_1127279] who experienced a prolonged air flight 
30 days after study completion, was considered by [CONTACT_814362].  
 
In the dose escalation study 3 patients (including a patient on the bazedoxifene 5mg dose, 80mg dose and 
placebo) had asymptomatic elevations of ALT levels. In all cases LFTs declined after discontinuation of the 
study drug.

For the purposes of this study, participants should be re -evaluated for response every 2 cycles (1 cycle = 4 
weeks). In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4 weeks 
following initial docume ntation of objective response. After  cycle 6, tumor measurements will be performed 
every 3 cycles.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international c riteria proposed by [CONTACT_86048] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  
Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in 
the case of m alignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1127305] their response classified accordi ng to the definitions  
stated below.  Bone only disease , if there are lytic lesions , is also allowed and treatment response will be 
evaluated based on the MD Anderson criteria.  (Note:  Participants  who exhibit objective disease progression 
prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Participants  who have lesions present at baseline that are evaluable 
but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy,  and have had 
their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based 
on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
Evaluable for PFS.  All participants randomized on this st udy are considered to be evaluable for PFS    (whether 
or not th ey are eligible, have measurable disease, or receive protocol therapy).  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1127306] one 
dimension ( longest diameter  to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_1127307] x -ray or ≥[ADDRESS_1127308] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 
   A lesion in a previously irradiated area is not eligible for measurable disease unless there  is objective evidence 
of progression of the lesion prior to study enrollment. Lesions in previously irradiated areas mu st be clearly 
identified as such.  
 
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_1127309] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no gre ater than 5 
mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
   
Page | 47  Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 
mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, 
inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic le sions are all 
considered  non-measurable.  
 
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that can be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_814367]. These lesions will be evaluated by [CONTACT_814368] 1.[ADDRESS_1127310] or MRI can be considered target lesions and response will be evaluated using 
the MD Anderson (MDA crit eria) [34]. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if th ey meet the definition of measurability described above . However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present  in the same participant , these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions in 
previously irradiated areas or areas subject to other loco -regional  therapy are usually not considered measurable 
unless there has been demonstrated progression of that lesion.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and  measured at 
baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend its elf to 
reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly 
should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calcula ted and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in 
the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the  measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All othe r lesions  (or sites of disease)  including any measurable lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_1127311] of a treatment.  
 
Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial ( e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diame ter as assessed using calipers  (e.g., skin nodules).  In  
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, 
is recommended.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI . These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_1127312] should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to 
   
Page | [ADDRESS_1127313], spatial, and temporal resolution; however, 
there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion 
conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable  globally.  As with CT, if an 
MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be 
the same as was used at bas eline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is 
beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the s ame type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed with breath -
hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
Ultrasound (US).  When the primary endpoint o f the study is objective response evaluation, US should not be 
used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial 
palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
 
FDG PET and PET/CT.  The acquisition of FDG PET and FDG PET/CT scans should follow the NCI 
Guidelines for using FDG PET as an indicator of therapeutic response (L.K. Shankar, J.M. Hoffman, S. 
Bacharach, M.M. Graham, J. Karp, A.A. Lammertsma, S. Larson, D.A. Mankoff, B.A. Siege l, A. Van den 
Abbeele, J. Yap, D. Sullivan. Consensus recommendations for the use of 18F - FDG PET as an indicator of 
therapeutic response in patients in National Cancer Institute Trials. J Nucl Med, 47(6):901 -903, 2006). Patients 
should avoid strenuous exe rcise and be on a low carbohydrate diet for [ADDRESS_1127314] a serum glucose of less than 200 mg/dL at 
the time of FDG injection. A 10 -20 mCi dose of FDG shoul d be injected for typi[INVESTIGATOR_738847]. For 
longitudinal studies with multiple scans, particular attention should be paid to ensure consistent patient 
preparation and acquisition parameters between the follow -up scan and the baseline scan. When designing  a 
study where PET scans are going to be utilized as one of the modalities to evaluate efficacy, it is important to 
consult with physicians in nuclear medicine in designing the appropriate criteria to be utilized. In this protocol, 
PET or PET/CT should NOT  be used as the primary modality to evaluate objective response, but may be used in 
an adjunctive fashion together with either CT or MRI in cases of uncertainty, as clinically indicated.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been 
fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment and a high level 
of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Theref ore, the utilization of such techniques for 
objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in reference centers. However, such 
techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained . In this 
protocol, endoscopy or laparoscopy will not be used for evaluation of response.  
 
Tumor markers.  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and complete 
responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known 
residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment 
when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate betwe en 
response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
   
Page | 49  11.1.4  Response Criteria   
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whethe r target 
or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on  study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute  increase of at least 5 mm . 
 
Evaluation of Lytic  Bone Lesion Target Lesion (MDA criteria)  
 
Response category  Criteria  
Complete response  Complete sclerotic fill -in of lytic lesions on x -ray or CT scan.  
 
Normalization of bone density on x -ray or CT scan.  
 
Normalization of signal intensity on MRI.  
 
Normalization of tracer uptake on skeletal scintigraphy  
 
Partial Response  Development of a sclerotic rim or partial sclerotic fill -in of lytic 
lesions on x -ray or CT scan.  
Osteoblastic flare - Interval visualization of lesions with sclerotic 
rims or new sclerotic lesions in the setting of other signs of PR and 
absence of progressive bony disease.  
≥ 50% decrease in measurable lesions on x -ray, CT, or MRI.  
≥ 50% subjective decrease in the size of ill-defined lesions on x -ray, 
CT, or MRI.  
≥ 50% subjective decrease in tracer uptake on skeletal scintigraphy . 
Progressive Response  ≥ 25% increase in size of measurable lesions on x -ray, CT, or MRI.  
≥ 25% subjective increase in the size of ill -defined les ions on x -ray, 
CT, or MRI.  
≥ 25% subjective increase in tracer uptake on skeletal scintigraphy . 
New bone metastases.  
 
   
Page | 50   
 Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.    
 *Measurements are based on the sum of a perpendicular, bidimensional measurement of the greatest  diameters 
of each individual lesion.  
 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical respons e. 
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) :  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions * (new lesions must be > slice thickness) 
and/or unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not normally 
trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.     
 
*Definition of New Lesion : The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (ex: new 
bone lesions may be healin g or flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in 
an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion 
is equivocal (because of small size, etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and 
if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was 
discovered.  
 
Note : If tumor response data is missing for target lesions, the overall  assessment must be Unknown (UN) unless 
there is new disease that would result in an overall assessment of PD. However, if there is missing or 
unevaluable data for non -target lesions, but data is available for all target lesions, the overall response for t hat 
time point will be assigned based on the sum LD of all target lesions. Additionally, the assessment of CR cannot 
be made if there is missing or unevaluable data for non -target lesions. In this case, the overall assessment would 
be PR.  
 
Overall level of  substantial worsening that merits discontinuation of therapy. A useful test that can be applied 
when assessing non -targets for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden 
based on the change in non -measurable disease i s comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease.  Stable Disease  No change  
< 25% increase or < 50% decrease in size of measurable lesions  
< 25% subjective increase or < 50% subjective decrease in size of ill -
defined lesions  
No new bone metastases  
 
   
Page | 51  Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_814328], and  the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_157773] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
Unknown (UN): Assessment of non -target lesions cannot be made due to insufficient or unevaluable data. In 
this case, a concise explanation must be  given.  
 
Evaluation of  New Lesions  
 
Definition of New Lesion : The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (ex: new 
bone lesions may be healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in 
an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion 
is equivocal (because of smal l size, etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and 
if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was 
discovered.  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best  overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

treatment  without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be

Page | 52  11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date  that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started , or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at th e last 
disease evaluation ). 
 
Duration of overall complete response : The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented , or death due 
to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, 
including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due 
to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.  
 
Progression -Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from ran domization (or 
registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease 
progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation.  
 
Time to Progression : Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time fro m randomization (or registration) to 
progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those without progression reported.

months (24 weeks) and all patients complete at least [ADDRESS_1127322] stag e of the 
Phase II experience a DLT, the regimen will be considered too toxic and the study will be closed due to safety 
concern.  . If 7 or less of 17 patients experience a DLT, continued enrollment to the  second stage will be based 
on the Simon two -stage desig n to evaluate clinical benefit. Assuming that the true rate of adverse events is 30%, 
the probability that 8 or more patients experience DLT is 10%. Assuming an unacceptable adverse event rate of 
60%, there is a 91% probability of observing 8 or more event s and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_515543] a safety concern.     
 
DLT is based on the CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE v4.0)  and will be assessed over the first two cycles of treatment . A DLT will be defined as follows:  
 
• Grade  3 or higher hematologic or non -hematologic toxicity thought likely or definitely related to 
protocol therapy will be counted as a DLT, with the exception of: 
 
o Grade 3 neutropenia without fever  
o Grade 3 diarrhea that responds to maximal supportive measures. If grade 3 diarrhea is persistent > 7 
days despi[INVESTIGATOR_360385], it will be counted as a DLT  
o Grade 3 fatigue  
o Grade 3 hot flashes  
o Grade 3 electrolyte disturbance, unless persistent > 7 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_814329]. Patients who 
develop inevaluable disease during treatment or off study before follow -up disease evaluation would be 
considered as non -responders in final analyses.         
 
   
Page | 55  13.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate  and Study Duration  
 
A true clinical benefit rate of 20% or less would not be of clinical interest, a nd is the null hypoth esis to the 
Simon two -stage design.   A true rate of 40% among patients with ER/PR+, HER2 -, endocrine resistant 
metastatic or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer would be considered a clinically meaningful level of 
response, so the sample size was chosen to have high power (90%) to declare the combination effective at this 
rate, while con trolling the one -sided Type I error at no more than 10% under the null.  
 
Using the Simons optimal method, in the first stage, [ADDRESS_1127323] response  (≥30 %), the regimen will be considered worthy of further 
study.   With this design, the probability o f stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16505] 55 % if the true response rate is 20% . If the 
true response rate is 40 % the chance that the regimen is declared worthy of further study is 90%.

and all patients enrolled begin protocol therapy, the 95% CI for the response rate will be determined accounting 
for the two -stage design.

toxicity.  
 
   
Page | [ADDRESS_1127326]’s last study visit, whichever comes first. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be analyzed. 
Adverse events will be regarded as TEAEs if they started on or after the date and time of administration of the 
first dose of study treatment or if they were pr esent before the administration of the first dose of study treatment 
and increased in severity during the study. Treatment -emergent peripheral neuropathy will be followed until 
resolution or until the start of another anticancer therapy post treatment, whi chever occurs first.  
Adverse events w ill be graded using CTCAE v 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ).   Investigators w ill collect all CTCAE grades 
for all AEs (to assess both increasing and decreasing severity). Events will be summarized by [CONTACT_814369].  
The incidence of TEAEs and relatedness to study treatment will be summarized.  
Objecti ve response  rate will be calculated and the 95% CI for the response rate will be determined accounting 
for the two -stage design.    
 
Progression -free survival and Overall survival, as defined in section 11.1.6,  will be described using the method 
of Kaplan -Meier.  The point estimate of median PFS and OS, as well as estimates of PFS and OS at other time 
points, will be presented with 95% confidence intervals.  
    
It is anticipated that 20% of patients will have detectable ESR1  mutations . Assuming a 40% clinical benefit  rate 
and a 20% ESR1 mutation rate, we have 80% power to detect the difference of clinical benefit  rates between 
patients with and without ESR1 mutation if the clinical benefit  rate is 80% among patients with ESR1  mutation 
and 30% among pat ients without ESR1  mutation.  The following table gives the power of detecting the clinical 
benefit rate difference among patients with and without ESR1 mutation, assuming the total sample size is 37 
and clinical benefit rate is 40%.

Page | 67  APPENDIX E  RESEARCH SPECIMEN COLLECTION/SHIPPI[INVESTIGATOR_814334]. 
The amount of tissue collected will follow the guidelines listed below:  
 
• Breast: A goal of [ADDRESS_1127342] mass.  
 
• Skin/chest wall: A goal of 1 -2 5-mm punch biopsies will be obtained.  
 
• Lymph node:  A goal of 3 -6 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18 -gauge needle.  
 
• Liver:  A goal of 3 -6 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18 -gauge needle.  
 
• Lung: Because of the risk of pneumothorax associated with core needle biopsies of lung nodules, no 
core biopsies of lung nodules will be performed on this protocol; unless if they are clinically indicated.  
 
• Bone:  Because the yield of malignant tissue from bone biopsies tends to be relatively low, if a patient 
has another accessible site of disease (i.e. skin, lymph node, liver), that site should be biopsied 
preferentially. If bone is the only biopsy -accessible site, then a goal of 3 -6 core biopsy specimens will be 
obtained using an 11 -13 gauge needle.  
 
• Pleural Fluid:  A goal of [ADDRESS_1127343] thoracentesis procedure, 
with or without image guidance, according to the clinical judgment of the treating physician and 
clinician performing the procedure. Less than the goal amount is acceptable, and should be based upon 
the clinical judgment of the Investigator and the clinician performing the procedure. If more than the 
goal amount of fluid is obtained, then the entire specimen (w ith the exception of what is needed for 
clinical purposes, if applicable) will be stored in the tissue bank.  
 
• Ascites fluid:  A goal of [ADDRESS_1127344] paracentesis procedure, 
with or without image guidance, accordi ng to the clinical judgment of the treating physician and 
clinician performing the procedure. Less than the goal amount is acceptable, and should be based upon 
the clinical judgment of the Investigator and the clinician performing the procedure. If more th an the 
goal amount of fluid is obtained, then the entire specimen (with the exception of what is needed for 
clinical purposes, if applicable) will be stored in the tissue bank.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Page | [ADDRESS_1127345] clinical judgment at the time the procedure is performed . Less than the goal quantity of tissue is 
accepted for each type  of biopsy, and will be left to the clinical judgment of the physician performing t he 
procedure. If ascites or pleural fluid is to be used as the investigational biopsy specimen,  consideration should 
be given to confirming the malignant nature of the ascites or pleural  fluid prior to study entry.  
 
If a patient is undergoing resection of a lesion for clinical reasons  (i.e. wedge resection of a new lung lesion 
for confirmation of diagnosis or re -testing of hormone receptor or HER2 status; or, resection of a chest wall 
lesion; or, resection of a lymph node), then the patient may opt to have a portion of that tissue (roughly 
equivalent to the goal amount of tissue listed in the guidelines above, i.e. the equivalent of two 5 -mm punch 
biopsies of the skin, or 3 -6 18-gauge core biopsies) stored for research at the time of the procedure (provided 
that the tissue is processed as specified in Section 8.3 ), in which case, the patient would not be required to 
undergo a separate research biopsy for entry into this protocol.  
 
Tissue Biopsy Handling and Processing  
 
Following research biopsy of a specimen, 1 tissue core will be placed in formalin and sent to SHL  for 
embedding in paraffin. FFPE blocks will be sectioned and 20 slides will be cut for H+E and 
Immunohistochemistry staining that will be performed at the SHL  core directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jon Aster.  The other 
cores will be frozen in OCT and sent to the Broad Institute for the Center for Cancer Precision Medicine  
(CCPM) testing (whole exome sequencing and RNAseq). The remaining tissue will be stored for future 
research . All samples will be anonymized by [CONTACT_20526] a unique sample ID number prior to use.  
 
Archival Tissue Collection  
 
Tissue blocks of primary and/or metastatic tumor samples should be sent to Dana - Farber Cancer Institute 
within in 2 weeks of the start of protocol therapy. If blocks cannot be submitted, 20 unstained slides are 
acceptable.   
 
Cell free DNA (cfDNA)  blood c ollection  
 
Blood will be collected at baseline and on Day [ADDRESS_1127346]: Megan Hana

will be returned to DF/HCC Clinical Trials Core laboratory .

Page | 71  APPENDIX G  PHARMACY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DISPENSING PALBOCICLIB  
 
For this trial [COMPANY_007] distributes Palbociclib in bottles containing 23 capsules.  Participants should only take 21 
capsules (Days 1 -21 of each 28 day cycle).  With approval from [COMPANY_007] and as a preventive measure and from 
participants taking all 23 capsules we are recommending that pharmacies remove the 2 extra capsules from each 
bottle before dispensing to the participants since [COMPANY_007] is unable to dis tribute bottles containing only 21 
capsules.  While this is not required we strongly recommend this procedure to prevent participants from taking 
extra capsules.  
 
This process will require careful drug account ability documentation.  On the DARF document t hat 21 capsules 
were dispensed to the participant.  A second line should be recorded to state “Destroyed per SOP” in the patient 
initials and MRN fields and “ -2” for the amount dispensed.

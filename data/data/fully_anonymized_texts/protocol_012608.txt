APPEN DIX B: COVID-[ADDRESS_608503]  
As of early April,  2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, caused by [CONTACT_474909][INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-2), has infected over 1.[ADDRESS_608504] that use of angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II  receptor blockers 
(ARBs) may be associated with lower risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID- 192,3,4.  
ACEIs and ARBs are part of the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibiting agents and 
considered as one of the first-line the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_474899] a large proportion of patients with 
hypertension.  However, continued use of ACEI/ARB has become controversial in the setting of COVID -
19. The reason for this controversy stems from the fact that ACEIs and ARBs use may increase the 
expression of ACE2 receptor5-7, which is the known cellular receptor and a necessary entry point for SARS-
COV-2 infection8. Therefore, continued use of ACEIs and ARBs among patients with COVID- 19 infection 
is controversial due to theoretical concerns of potentially increased cellular invasion of SARS -COV-2 or 
enhanced susceptibility towards SARS -COV-2 infection. Conversely, it has been indicated that ACE2 
expression is downregulated following SARS infection, resulting in excessive activation of RAAS  and 
exacerbated pneumonia progression mediated by [CONTACT_161221]9,10. Therefore, administration of ACEI/ARB 
may in turn be beneficial by [CONTACT_474910]-induced hyperactivation of RAAS and thereby [CONTACT_474911][INVESTIGATOR_474900]-19.  
Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor that is approved by [CONTACT_474912], to reduce the 
risk of heart failure and death post -myocardial infarction, and reduction of risk of myocardial infarc tion, 
stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes. The drug’s suppressing effects on the renin -angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) system leads to inhibition of tissue and circulating ACE activity.  This leads 
to cessation of angiotensin II -related vaso constrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects and 
improvement in hypertension, inflammation and oxidative stress. These properties may be useful.  
Ramipril has not been studied in SARS -CoV-2 infected patients. In this study we propose to treat 560 
patients with ramipril or placebo for 14 days. After an initial evaluation for COVID -19 status, medical 
history, and symptom assessment, patients will receive either 2 .5 mg/day of ramipril or placebo. Patients’ 
symptoms and study endpoints will be monitored at regular intervals. Additional follow -up will be 
performed at  day 28. As an exploratory objective, biomarkers of the RAAS axis will also be monitored. 
The primary endpoints of successful therapy will be improved survival, reductions in ICU admissions , 
and/or reductions in use of mechanical ventilator support. Secondary endpoints will be the proportion of patients needing continued hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], time to mortality, time to ICU admission, time to discharge from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], proportion of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_474901], and proportion of 
patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_474902].

 BACKGROUND  
The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, caused by [CONTACT_11550][INVESTIGATOR_18960] 2 (SARS -CoV-2)11, is projected to infect millions of people worldwide and lead to 240,[ADDRESS_608505] hypertension, along with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, predisposes individuals to increased risk for 
more severe COVID-19 symptoms and higher mortality
1. Angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) block the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (R AAS) 
and are commonly prescribed treatments for patients with these conditions. Use of this drug class for 
COVID-[ADDRESS_608506] been observed in patients with hypertension and diabetes, respectively, who underwent treatment with ARBs and ACEIs
76.  
Use of ACEIs/ARBs in COVID-19 patients:  However, several lines of evidence suggest use of ACEIs 
and ARBS may of fer protective effects in COVID -[ADDRESS_608507], use of ACEIs and ARBs may offer therapeutic benefit in treatment of the COVID-19 patient population. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_474913] 1128 adult COVID -19 patients 
admitted to 9 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338786], China
3. In this retrospective cohort study of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992]-
19 patients with hypertension, the  28-day all -cause mortality rate among patients who had inpatient 
treatment with ACEI/ARB (n=188) compared with ACEI/ARB nonusers (n=940) was 3.7% vs 9.8%, a 
difference that was statistically significant. In this study, inpatient ACEI/ARB treatment associated with a 
lower mortality risk, although the findings may be influenced by [CONTACT_35250]. Further support 
comes from previous studies showing ACEIs/ARBs may benefit patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS)13-16.  
Ramipril:  First approved for clinical use nearly 3 decades ago, Ramipril is a 2 -aza-bicyclo [3.3.0] -octane-
3-carboxylic acid derivative  that has potent antihypertensive properties. It undergoes de -esterification in 
the liver to form ramiprilat, its active metabolite and a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor. Ramipril is approved 
by [CONTACT_474912], to reduce the risk of heart failure and death post -myocardial 
infarction, and reduction of risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and de ath from cardiovascular causes. The 
drug’s mitigating effects on hypertension are largely attributed to its suppression of the RAAS  system. 
Ramipril’s inhibition of tissue and circulating ACE activity results in reduced angiotensin II formation.  
The drug is generally well tolerated with the most prevalent adverse effects in patients with hypertension 
being headache, dizziness, and fatigue.  
 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_608508] a randomized, double -blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the efficac y 
of ramipril at 2.5 mg orally daily versus placebo given over 14 days to improve COVID -19 patient outcomes 
including  mortality, ICU admission rates, and rates of invasive mechanical ventilator use.  
In this study, we propose to randomize up to 510 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by 
[CONTACT_474914]- 19 infection (fever or cough or shortness of breath) 
with positive IgM serology, to either ramipril or placebo for 14 days. We plan to enroll a total of 560 
patients, expecting some drop outs prior to randomization. After an initial medical history and screening 
labs and procedures, patients will be randomized to receive either  ramipril 2.5  mg or placebo or ally for 14 
days.  Patients’ symptoms and study endpoints will be monitored at regular intervals. After 14 days, in 
patient participants will undergo end-of -treatment visit with collection of lab results from medical records, 
if done as part of routine medi cal care. An additional follow -up visit will be performed at day 28.  For 
outpatient participants, the Day 14 and Day 28 visits will be virtual.  
As an exploratory objective, biomarkers of the RAAS  axis, will also be monitored  in a subset of patients. 
The primary endpoints of successful therapy will be improved survival, reductions in ICU admissions, and/or reductions in use of invasive mechanical ventilator support. Secondary endpoints will be the 
proportion of patients needing continued hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], tim e to mortality, time to ICU admission, time to 
discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], proportion of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_474901], acute

 Risks and hazards of Rami pril:  
First approved for clinical use nearly [ADDRESS_608516] frequent clinical side effects reported 
included headache (5.4%), dizziness (2.2%), and fatigue (2.0%). Only fatigue has been observed to be more 
common in ram ipril groups, compared to the placebo group. Side effects have generally been observed to 
be mild and transient and were not dose -dependent. Discontinuation of ram ipril due to side effects occurred 
in 3% of US patients in clinical trials. The common reasons cited for di scontinuation were: cough (1.0%), 
dizziness (0.5%), and impotence (0.4%). In the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study (HOPE 
study)22-23, 4,[ADDRESS_608517] that led to excess discontinuation of ram ipril was cough. Ram ipril is a well -studied 
and reasonably safe drug. However, we will monitor study s ubjects carefully for any adverse reactions 
either via physical exams for inpatients or through remotely conducted visits by [CONTACT_474919].  
Criteria for discontinuation 
Any patient meeting ≥ Grade 3 toxicity (per Table 2) or meeting the primary endpoint will have the study 
drug/placebo  discontinued. There is no recommended dose modification.  Outpatients will also be screened 
for symptoms and those with symptoms consistent with any of the below adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_474908]/placebo .

monitoring laboratory assessments while on study drug/placebo  will only occur in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. 
Grade 3, 4, 5 reactions warrant drug /placebo  discontinuation  
The risks and discomforts of frequent phlebotomy  
Blood samples will be obtained to document changes in levels of biochemical markers of the RAAS system 
and to monitor the metabolic effects and toxicities of ramipril . Blood collection by [CONTACT_474920], and the possibility of localized bruising, phlebitis, or extravasation. The risk of infection or fainting is extremely small.  
Data and Safety Monitoring  
The UC San Diego Clinical and Translational Research In stitute will appoint an independent data safety 
monitoring board (DSMB) composed of two independent physicians  and one statistician . The DSMB will 
undertake a review of the interim data from the study to ensure the safety of study participants and to 
recommend changes to the study including early termination or modification of the study if it appears futile. 
The DSMB will review a sum mary of data by [CONTACT_474921], toxicity 
and adverse events. A planned interim analysis will occur after approximately 50% of the planned 
enrollment from the trial has been completed, approximately [ADDRESS_608521] of review of all 
study patients including flow sheets of major safety and efficacy measurements.  All measurements and 
tests are well established in clinical medicine.  Yearly reports are made to the UCSD IRB regarding safety 
and efficacy.  
Adverse Event Reporting  
All serious adverse events will be reported to the local IRB and sponsor within 7 days.  Unexpected and related fatal or life -threatening events will be reported within 48 hours and reports will be sent to the FDA, 
MEDWATCH program (telephone 1 -800-FDA-1088; or via the Internet at  
www.fda.gov/medwatch/index.html .) 
Patient Privacy  
All data and study forms will be in secured locations (locked room or cabinet) and access is limited to study 
personnel.  Subject names are not used; instead a name [CONTACT_474922].  Release of data 
to persons or organizations outside study personnel will require written consent of the subject.  
All consents will be stored in well -marked binders in locked file cabinets located in private offices at UCSD 
Medical center. Databases with identifying information will be secure as they will be password protected and encrypted.  Staff will be trained in HIPPA guidelines and confidentiality issues.

 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
The primary out come of this study will be represented by a composite of outcomes which will include 
mortality, ICU admission, and/or need for ventilator use within a 14-day period. Statistical analyses will 
compare outcomes between treatment versus placebo -arms. It is no t possible to predict what the 
spontaneous or therapeutic response rate will be. Thus, we predict that the spontaneous improvement rate 
would be zero to less than 1%. In the primary analysis, we assume that the 14 day mortality/ICU 
admission/Ventilator use  of placebo and ramipril -treatment group to be 22% and 12 %, and the proportion 
of the sample from placebo to ramipril -treatment group to be 1:2. Therefore, using Whittemore’s formula 
(Whittemore, 1981), we estimate a sample size of 510 patients--340 in the  ramipril arm and 170 in the 
placebo arm —will be required to detect effects with a power 80% (or higher) with a Type I error rate of 
alpha = 0.05. This formula is used for logistic regression which has an overall event proportion of P and an 
odd ratio of r  at one standard deviation above the mean of the predictor.  
Statistical analysis plan: 
The primary outcome will first be analyzed using a 2x2 contingency table (treatment by [CONTACT_305846]) and 
testing will use Fisher’s exact test. Primary analyses will be Intent  to Treat (ITT). 
We expect to enroll up to [ADDRESS_608522] had 
variable dropout rates. Previous short -term studies of ramipril had less than 10 % dropouts. Therefore , we 
expect less than a 10% dropout rate. Dropouts would be considered non-responders based upon intention to treat analysis. A modified intention to treat analysis will be done in which we will exclude the patients 
who dropped out before getting the week 2 exit evaluation.  
 
Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed comparing placebo and treatment arms using 
parametric or non -parametric tests as indicated.  
The major primary out come  to be evaluated is a composite of mortality or need for ICU admission or 
invasive mechanical ventilator use within a 14 -day window.  
The major secondary outcomes to be evaluated are:  
1. Proportion of patients needing continued hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125883] 14  
2. Time to discharge 
3. (For discharged to outpatient sub-group only) Need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
4. Proportion of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_474901]  
5. Proportion of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_474902] 
6. Proportion of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_67466]  
7. Composite of mortality or need for ICU admission or invasive mechanical ventilator use within a 
28-day window

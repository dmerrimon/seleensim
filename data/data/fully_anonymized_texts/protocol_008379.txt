2.1 Background  
2.1.1 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by [CONTACT_104663] -related problems. COPD was the third leading cause of death in the United State s 
in [ADDRESS_116053] hyper -responsiveness, and poor lung 
growth durin g childhood4. COPD severity can be stratified with the use of spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], which is a 
series of tests to measure the volume of air a patient can inhale, the volume of a ir a patient can 
exhale, and how  quickly a patient can exhale. COPD treatment options depend directly  on the 
severity of a patient’s condition. Therapy options for COPD symptoms include : smoking 
cessation, pharmacologic therapy, coaching on inhaler techniq ue, vaccinations against respi[INVESTIGATOR_104655],  and pulmonary rehabilitation5.  
2.1.2 Long -term oxygen therapy  
Long -term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is prescribed  for patients whose COPD is considered severe. 
LTOT is defined by [CONTACT_104664] ≥15 hours of oxygen use per day6. Oxygen is 
provide d continuously to the patient in either a continuous -flow or pulsed delivery pattern. 
Patients with more significant COPD symptoms are expected to benefit from LTOT as it has been 
shown to improve survival, exercise, sleep , and cognitive performance7. LTOT systems includ e 
oxygen concentrators (OC), liquid oxygen (LO) and portable oxygen concentrators (POCs). OCs 
remain the most economical  way to provide oxygen at home. Many modern LTOT users are 
considered hi ghly active and ambulatory when compared to their historic counterparts, who often 
were considered truly homebound8, 9. However, t o comply with physician prescription to breathe 
oxygen for ≥ 15 hours per day, patients using many of the LTOT modalities  are forced to stay at 
home and to limit their outdoor activities.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Oxygen Cylinder s – Liquid or Gas  
Oxygen is delivered to the patient either via a flow meter attached to the cylinder or via an oxygen 
conservation device. Unlike continuous flow  devices , oxygen conservation device s deliver oxygen 
predominantly during inspi[INVESTIGATOR_104656]. The most common oxygen conservation devices  are ‘demand flow’, which deliver a 
pre-set volume or bolus of oxygen in early inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. An other type of oxygen conservation 
device  consists of a nasal cannula set with an integrated pendant -shaped reservoir that fills with 
oxygen during exhalation and delivers a bolus of oxygen during subsequent inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] .10.A less 
efficient combination is the use of an OC at home and pressurized oxygen in small lightweight 
cylinder for ambulation. Need for frequent refilling and cumbersome logistics make this source 
less convenient9, for this reason, POCs  represent a higher level of convenience as compared to 
other ambulatory systems (e.g., LO)8. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Portable Oxygen Concentrators  
Like stationary OCs, POCs separate nitrogen from ambient air and are capable of delivering  93–
95% oxygen at a rate of 3 –4 L/min . They are small and lightweight (maximum  weight 4 kg for 
intermittent flow systems, or 9 k g for continuous flow systems)  and can be powered by [CONTACT_104665], 
car, or rechargeable batteries11. Two types of POCs are available : continuous flow and pulse flow. 
Unlike continuous  flow oxygen, pulse flow devices  provide a pre -set oxygen bolus (measured in 
milliliters  per breath) during the first 60% of in spi[INVESTIGATOR_104657]. The pulse 
flow system is capable of delivering the same volume of oxygen per breath, regardless of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].

Version: 1.0; Date: 29-Oct-19                       Company Confid ential  Page 9 of 24 
 
 
 
POCs, such as Mobi™ , have been shown to  help improve moderate to severe COPD patient’s 
functional ability, quality of life, prevent emergency room encounters , and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104658]12. There may be some improvements in quality of life 
with use o f POCs compared with liquid oxygen cylinders, but study results are inconsistent13. 
2.2 Rationale for the Study  
Mobi™ is a relatively new  POC in the market and thus it is valuable to compare data from COPD 
patients using supplemental oxygen  against data from  Mobi™  use during ambulation . The purpose 
of the present study is to compare Mobi™ with a continuous flow oxygen cylinder , with mean 
SpO2 during a 6MWT as the primary endpoint.  
3. Description of the Medical Device s 
3.1  Portable Oxygen Concen trator (POC ) 
Mobi™ is indicated for patients who r equire supplemental oxygen, including COPD patients. It 
provides supplemental, high oxygen concentration to these patients. It is available via prescription 
only and may be used in the home, institution, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225], as well as travel environment s 
as the Mobi™  is portable.   
3.1.1 Reprocessing the device  
When the device is used for multiple patients, the device should be cleaned  between each 
participant  per the Mobi™  Provider Guide15. The n asal cannula and inlet air filter should be  
disposed of and replaced  between patients .  
3.2 Portable Oxygen Cylinder  
Participant  will use a portable , continuous flow  E oxygen cylinder provided by [CONTACT_104666] a 
comparison.  
3.3 Other Medical Devices  
3.3.1 SpO 2 Monitoring  
Pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and pulse rate are monitored continuously with approved 
devices .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Oximeter  
The PalmSat 2500  oximeter (Nonin Medical, Inc ) will be used  in this study. Trained study staff 
will place the oximeter on the patient’s non -dominant forefinger just before beginning each 
6MWT. This study staff representative will hold the oximeter device during the 6MWT, so they 
can continuously monitor the SpO2 l evels of the patient during this assessment.  
4. Objectives and endpoints  
4.1 Objectives  
4.1.1 Primary objective

7.2 Visit 1 
Eligible participant s will be randomized  into one of two study groups , which will define the order 
in which they use the control device or Mobi™  device during the 6MWT . The overall Visit 1 
procedure is pr esented graphically in Figure 7 -1: 
 
 
 
Figure 7 -1 
  
The order of 6MWTs will be randomized within  the EDC , and in each of the two 6MWTs the 
participant s will use either : 
 Mobi™ ; or 
 A portable oxygen cylinder .  
 
Site staff  will pull the oxygen cylinder via a trolley or carry the Mobi™ device via its carrying 
bag. This will ensure consistency across tests. 6MWTs will be conducted according to current 
ERS/ATS field test guidelines16,17.   
7.2.1 Prior to 6MWT  
Prior  to 6MWT, t he following w ill be performed and documented:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Oxygen titration  
Each participant will undergo titration using MobiTM to reach SpO2 of ≥90%. After the MobiTM 
titration, each participant will rest for at least [ADDRESS_116059] a resting SpO2 of ≥90% prior to 
starting each  6MWT.  
During use of the oxygen cylinder 6MWT, the settings will be based on  the patient’s original 
prescription.   
During the use of the Mobi™  device 6MWT, the patient will use Mobi™  based on the titrated 
Mobi™  setting.   
After startin g therapy, the site staff should also wait for approximately 5 minutes to make sure  no 
alarms turn on.  Both of these oxygen system settings will be recorded.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital signs  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  
 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be measured in a sitting position after the 
participant  has been resting and by [CONTACT_104669] . 
 Pulse (beats per minute) must be recorded after the participant has been resting  for 5 
minutes in a sitting position.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Modified Borg scale  
Each participant will rate their baseline dyspnea and fatigue level s using the modified Borg scale  
(see Appendix 4) and move to the starting point  
7.2.2 During 6MWT  
During each 6MWT,  the following will be measured25: 
 SpO 2 
 Time to participant’s  first rest , if applicable  
 Distance at point of participant’s first rest, if applicable  
 Number of rest times, if applicable  
 6MWD  
 
If the participant uses walking aids (cane, walker, etc.), these aids  should be used during  each 
6MWT.  
Trained study staff will walk alongside the participant for each 6MWT. This study representative 
will carry the SpO2 monitor, and monitor the participant during the walk, assessing for any 
variables that may require the participant to rest or terminate the test (e g: study representative may 
terminate the 6MWT if the participant’s SpO2 is below 80%).

 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  
 Pulse (beats per minute)  
 Post-walk dyspnea and fatigue levels measured by [CONTACT_104670] 6MWT, participants will rest  for at least [ADDRESS_116061].  
 
After each of the two 6MWTs, participants  will complete a participant acceptance questionnair e 
involving questions about  ease of use and other aspects specifi c to portable oxygen  use. 
7.3 End of Study  
End of study is considered to be the completion of Visit 1. There is no follow up period.  
Protocol  
 
 
Version: 1.0; Date: 29-Oct-[ADDRESS_116062] clinical signs  in 
participants , whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
 
An AE includes:  
 A clinically significant worsening of a pre-existing  condition . 
 
The following should not be reported as AEs:  
 Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other study  
procedures performed before exposure to study  product (pre -existing conditions should be 
reported as medical history or concomitant illness).  
 Pre-planned procedures , unless the condition for which the procedure was plann ed has 
worsened from the first study  related activity after the participant  has signed the informed 
consent.  
 
The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE:  
 Severity  
– Mild  - no or transient  symptoms, no interference with the participant ’s daily activities.  
– Moderate  - marked symptoms, moderate interference with the participant ’s daily 
activities.  
– Severe  - considerable interference with the participant ’s daily activities; unacceptable.  
 Causali ty  
Relationship between an AE and device (s):  
– Unrelated:  The event is due to the underlying disease state or concomitant medication or 
therapy not related to the study -specific devices or procedures.  
– Unlikely related :  The event had no significant temporal relationship to the study -specific 
devices or procedures and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
– Possibly related:  The event had a strong temporal relationship to the study -specific 
devices or procedures and alternative etiology is equal ly or less likely compared to the 
potential relationship to the study -specific devices or procedures.  
– Probably related:  The event had a strong temporal relationship to the study -specific 
devices or procedures and another etiology is unlikely.  
– Unknown:   Relationship of the event to the study -specific devices or procedures and 
alternative etiology is unknown  
 Final outcome  
– Recovered/resolved  - The participant  has fully recovered, or by [CONTACT_104671] t he level observed at the first study -related activity 
after the participant  signed the informed consent.  
– Recovering/resolving  - The condition is improving and the participant  is expected to 
recover from the event. This term is only applicable if the participant ha s completed the 
study or has died from another AE.

but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela e meets 
an SAE criterion, the AE m ust be reported as an SAE.  
– Not recovered/not resolved  - The condition of the participant  has not improved and the 
symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known.  
– Fatal  - This term is only applicable if the participant  died from a condition related to the 
reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a participant  before he/she died should 
be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with 
sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An  AE with fatal outcome must be reported as 
an SAE.

circumstances  had been less fortunate are treated as the same reporting category as SAEs and must 
be reported accordingly to the SAE process  
9. Risk and Benefits  
9.[ADDRESS_116065] of potential risks . 
9.1.1 Minimization of Risks  
This study involves the use of a FDA -cleared, Class II medical  device and  CE marked  devices 
that deliver oxygen therapy with no greater than minimal risk to participant s.  All study devices 
will be used in accordance with their respective approved indicati ons and instructions.  
Protocol  
 
 
Version: 1.0; Date: 29-Oct-19                       Company Confid ential  Page 18 of 24 
 
 
 
As per FDA good practice guidelines (21 CFR 10.115), this study protocol as well as the Mobi™ 
device was assessed for risk to participants. As this study does not meet the definition of 
significant risk as defined by 21 CFR 812.3(m) , the investigative team has determined that this 
protocol and the Mobi device is non -significant risk.    All participants  will maintain all other 
therapy regimens per standard clinical care; this protocol does not dictate any other adjustments 
to the participants’ care regimen and there are no protocol -required assessments or procedures that 
pose significant risk to the part icipants. As required by [CONTACT_1622], the IRB will review this study 
protocol and make the final determination of NSR designation.  
 
Participants should be encouraged to discuss any issues they are having with therapy during the 
study. The investigator should a ssess for changes in the health or well -being of the participant in 
response to general, non -directed questioning (e.g., “How are you feeling while using the 
therapy?”).  Side effects should be documented on the site’s source documents. Furthermore, if 
during the evaluation the participant cannot complete an assessment, the participant may sit down 
until they feel stable to continue.  Potential expected adverse events are believed to be mild and 
similar to other commercially available POC systems.  
 
The atte nding study staff have experience setting up the eligible patient population in this study.  
All participants  return to their current oxygen therapy after completing the study visits.  
The following will be performed to minimize risks:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety assessments  
During this study, participant s SpO 2 and heart rate will be  monitored before, during and 
immediately following the walk to ensure devices connectivity and to ensure participant  safety19. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Site staff training and experience  
A delegated site staff  will be present during each session with participant s. A delegated site staff  
should be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation  with a minimum of Basic Life Support by [CONTACT_104674] –approved cardiopulmonary  resuscitation course. Advanced cardiac 
life support certification  is desirable. Training, experience, and certification  in related health care 
fields (registered nurse, registered respi[INVESTIGATOR_104659], certifie d pulmonary function technician ) 
are also desirable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  6MWT guidelines  compliance  
6MWT s will be conducted according to the guidelines (ERS/ ATS) and participant s will be 
followed by a delegated site staff . Safety check points for immediately stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 6MWT  in ERS/ 
ATS guideline will be undertaken to minimize risk associated with this test.  A delegated site staff  
must recognize these problems and the appropriate responses.  If in their clinical judgment there 
are signs of participan t distress, the test ses sion will be stopped and participant s will be returned 
to their current oxygen device.  
9.2 Potential benefits  
There may be no benefits to participants from taking part in the study.  Benefits during the study 
may include:  
 Symptomatic re lief from dyspnea . 
 Maintenance of  SpO2 during 6MWT s. 
However, it is not expected that these benefits will last longer than the duration of the study . 
Protocol  
 
 
Version: 1.0; Date: 29-Oct-[ADDRESS_116066] (6MWT).  The 
primary aim of this protocol is to show non -inferiority between the Mobi oxygen device and the 
control device with respect to mean SpO [ADDRESS_116067] using a non -
inferiority margin  (NIM) of  2%. 
H0: μA - μB ≤ -NIM (Mobi is inferior)  
H1: μA - μB > -NIM (Mobi is non -inferior)  
where μ A and μ B are the mean SpO 2 after using the Mobi device (A) and the Control device (B), 
respectiv ely, and NIM equals the non -inferiority margin.  A significant level of 0.025 will be used.  
10.2 Analysis Populations  
The populations are defined as follows.  
 The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) is defined as all patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and begi n the first 6MWT.  
 The Completed Cases (CC) population is defined as all patients in the ITT population 
who complete both the first and second 6MWTs.  
The primary endpoint analysis will be based on the CC participant  population.  A participant  may 
rest durin g the 6MWT and still complete the test, however if the participant  stops completely then 
the 6MWT will be considered incomplete.  A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be 
generated for the ITT population.  The ITT population may contain some participants  who 
complete the first study 6MWT but not the second study 6MWT.  This will require the use of 
imputation methods for missing values which are documented in Section 10.9.  
All safety analyses will be generated for participants  in the ITT population.  All secondary 
endpoints will be generated using the CC population.  
10.[ADDRESS_116068]  (ANOVA ).  
Specifically, a repeated -measures ANOVA with fixed treatment and period effect and random 
participant  effects will be fit to the data. The mean difference between treatment effects will  
compared to a non -inferiority margin of -2%, using a Wald test .  Additionally, the 97.5% lower 
one-sided confidence bound for the mean paired difference in mean SpO 2 between the Mobi 
device and the Control device  will be calculated.   
10.4 Justification of Sample Size  
Based on a study by [CONTACT_104675].26, evaluating the clinical effectiveness of the Inogen One G2 
device compared to Continuous Oxygen Cylinder, the observed mean (standard deviation) in 
mean SpO 2 during the 6MWT was 82.3% (3.5) for Inogen and 80.3% (2.2) for continuous oxygen.  
For estimating the SD of the difference, we assume that the SD for the Mobi device will be similar 
to the Inogen One G2 results.  The within patient correlation is assumed to be small, r=0.2. The 
standard deviation o f the difference is 3 .74, estimated using the following formula:  sqrt(SD12 + 
Protocol  
 
 
Version: 1.0; Date: 29-Oct-19                       Company Confid ential  Page 20 of 24 
 
 
SD22 – (2*r*SD1*SD2)), where SD1 and SD2 are the standard deviations for each study treatment 
and r is the correlation between the repeated measures (within a participant ).   
Assuming a standard deviation of the difference is 3.74, a true mean difference between treatments 
of 0, and one -sided significance level of 0.025, a sample size of 30 provides 80% power to detect 
non-inferiority when the non -inferiority margin is -2.0.  This  sample size was generated using the 
Non-Inferiority Tests for the Difference Between Two Means in a 2x2 Cross -over Design 
procedure, PASS Version 2019 software27.   Since both treatments will be completed during the 
same visit, a small drop -out rate is assumed at 5%.  Thus, a total of 32 (30/0.95) participants  will 
be enrolled in the study, each participant  randomized with respect to the order of trea tment . 
10.[ADDRESS_116069] error, minimum and 
maximum will be calculated  for continuous variables, unless otherwise stated. The number of 
significant digits reported will be as follows: minimum and maximum will have the same number 
of significant digits as the raw data; the mean, median, standard deviation, and standard error will 
be reported with one more significant digit than the raw data. Frequencies and percentages will be 
calculated for categorical data using one significant digit for percentages.  
10.6 Baseline Characteristics  and Medical History  
Demographic, baseline characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, race, BMI), medical history and 
concomitant medications collected during the screening visit will be summarized descriptively for 
the ITT population. For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation (SD), number 
evaluated, median, minimum and maximum will be provided. For categorical variables, the 
number with the characteristic, the number evaluated,  and the percentage will be presented  
10.[ADDRESS_116070] -6MWT oxygen saturation (SpO2), distance walked during the 
6MWT (6MWD), time spent ≥90% SpO2 during 6MWT, pre and post -6MWT modified Borg 
Dyspnea Scale, and acceptance questionnaires comparing patient experience and comfort between 
Mobi and Control treatmen ts.  Descriptive statistics will be presented for each secondary endpoint 
by [CONTACT_1570], including mean, standard deviation, median, median, inter -quartiles, 
minimum and maximum values.  A cross -over ANOVA with fixed treatment and period effects 
and r andom subject effects will be used to summarize the difference in means between treatment 
groups and the associated 95% confidence intervals for each secondary endpoint.   
10.8 Safety Analyses  
A listing of all adverse events occurring during the study period wi ll be generated including all 
participants  in the ITT population.  The listing will include the event description, time of 
occurrence, severity, outcome and action taken.  
10.9 Handling of Missing Values  
The primary endpoint analysis will be based on the CC pop ulation.  A sensitivity analysis will be 
done using the ITT population and a mixed -effects cross -over analysis.  The mixed -effects 
analysis uses maximum likelihood to estimate parameters when there are missing values and is 
appropriate when data is missing  at random (MAR).

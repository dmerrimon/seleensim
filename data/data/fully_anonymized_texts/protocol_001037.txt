OVERALL TRIAL  DESIGN :  
A Screening Visit will be conducted 14 days ( ±7 days) prior to the Baseline V isit to determine eligibility.  
Subject s with aPAP confirmed to be stable or progressive during a period of at least two months prior to 
the Baseline Visit will be eligible for treatment. Subject s are not eligible for treatment  if spontaneous 
remission has occur red during this 2 -month period, defined as absolute VC improved by  [CONTACT_726] 5% 
and/or  DLCO improved by [CONTACT_726] 10%.  
At the Baseline V isit, eligible subject s will be randomised to receive treatment for up to 24 weeks with 
either :  
1) inhaled molgr amostim  (300 µg) administered once daily,  
2) inhaled molgramostim  (300 µg) and matching placebo administered intermittently (12 cycles of seven  
days molgramostim , seven days placebo; both administered once daily)  or  
3) inhaled placebo administered once daily.  
The trial will include two phases; a Double- blind treatment period consisting of up to eight  trial visits 
(Screening, Baseline, and at Weeks 4,8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 after randomisation) and a Follow -up period 
consisting of up to five trial  visits (at Weeks [ADDRESS_1125586] -treatment).  The [ADDRESS_1125587] any concerns.  
Subjects completing the 24 -week Double- blind treatment period will enter a 24-week or 48- week Follow -
up period and will receive treatment with  inhaled molgramostim  (300 µg) administered once daily in an 
intermittent regimen (12 or 24)  cycles of seven days molgramostim, seven days off) .  
During the trial,  WLL will be applied as rescue therapy. The criteri on for performing WLL is clinical 
worsening of aPAP based on symptoms, reduced exercise capacity and/or findings of hypoxemia or 
desaturation according to the Investigator’s judgement. The reason(s) for conducting WLL will be 
documented.  Subject s undergoing WLL during the Double- blind treatment period will continue double-
blind trial treatment . Treatment with molgramostim in the Follow -up period should be discontinued in 
case of disease worsening and/or safety concerns.  
After completion of both the Double- blind and Follow -up trial periods , subject s who require further 
treatment will be offered treatment with molgramostim  in a Compassionate Use Programme, where 
national regulations so allow.

NUMBER OF SUBJECT S: 
[ADDRESS_1125590] s (30 in each treatment group) are  intended  to be randomized.   
The sample size calculation for the primary endpoint  was based on data in an earlier trial , where the 
mean (and standard deviat ion) (A-a)DO 2 were 31.3 (7.4) before treatment and 12.9 (7.6)  after treatment  
(all measured in mmHg) . It was also based on previous assumptions about how the trial would be 
analysed (notably, to combine the two active doses together for the primary analysi s). The sample size 
calculation based on a n unpaired t-test of mean difference between the two active arms (combined) vs. 
placebo, using a significance level of 0.01 and a power of 90%  and a delta of [ADDRESS_1125591] sizes for the key secondary endpoints , the 
sample size is increased to 90 subjects (30 patients in each treatment arm), to increase the power to 
identify statistically sign ificant treatment effects also on one or more of the key secondary endpoints.  
A fully blinded sample size re- estimation procedure will be carried out  in January [ADDRESS_1125592] deviations of  the 6 Minute Walk Distance ( 6MWD ) and the 
St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] ( SGRQ ), as well as  the overall WLL event rate.  If the maximum 
of these sample size calculations comes to no more than 33 patients  per group, then no change to the 
target sample size will be made.   Otherwise, the sample size will be increased to attain 90% power  for at 
least [ADDRESS_1125593] to the total trial  size not exceeding 150 patients.  
NUMBER OF TRIAL  CENTRES:  
An appropriate number of specialised sites in (including but not limited to) Europe ([LOCATION_008], 
Denmark, [LOCATION_013], Italy, [LOCATION_009], Greece, Switzerland, Spain,  Slovakia, Poland, Portugal, Romania

STATISTICAL METHODS:  
The trial will be unblinded and primary analysis will be conducted after the 24 week Double- blind 
treatment period.  
The primary efficacy variable, (A-a)DO 2, will be tested using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  
model.  This model will have change from baseline to Week 24 in (A -a)DO [ADDRESS_1125607] treatment group and baseline (A -a)DO 2 will be predictor variables.  The mean difference betw een 
each active dose and placebo in change from baseline of (A -a)DO 2 will be estimated, along with its 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and associated statistical significance test.  
The key secondary endpoints of change from baseline in 6MWD and in SGRQ will be analysed using 
the same ANCOVA model as for (A -a)DO 2. Time to WLL will be analysed by [CONTACT_812900].   
Comparisons (for the primary and key secondary  endpoint s) will be carried out  as follows . The first will 
be of once daily dosing vs. placebo, and the second will be of intermittent dosing vs. placebo. These 
comparisons will be made in sequence:  the once daily dosing group will first be compared with placebo 
for the primary endpoint  and, if significant at P<0.05, then the 3 ke y secondary endpoints will be tested 
at an overall 5% significance level  using the Hochberg procedure.  If the test is significant for all of the 
key secondary endpoints, then the hierarchical testing will proceed with comparing intermittent dosing 
vs. plac ebo for the primary , and then the key secondary , endpoints in the same manner as for once daily 
dosing vs. Placebo.  
Subject s who withdraw early will have  (A-a)DO 2 measurement values imputed by [CONTACT_812901]. Sensitivity analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).    
Analyses pertaining to the Further Secondary Endpoints will be described in the SAP . 
Data from the Follow -up period will be reported descriptively  in a separate Fo llow-up report . 
TRIAL  PERIOD:  
The duration of trial participation for each subject is approximately 50 to 7 8 weeks:  
• Screening period for the subjects is  14 days (+/ - 7 days)  
• Double- blind period up to 24 weeks (+/ - 7 days)  
• Open- label period for 24 or 48 weeks (+/ - 14 days)

5.1 Background 
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)  
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a  rare autoimmune disease with an estimated 
prevalence of 0. 7 per 100,000 individuals  [1]. It is character ised by [CONTACT_812903] ( auto anti -GM-
CSF) in alveoli and blood. The autoantibodies neutral ise the normal biologic action of 
Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF) in the lungs [ 2]. Pulmonary 
Alveolar Proteinosis  is also character ised by [CONTACT_812904]-Schiff (PAS) -
positive  lipoproteinaceous material , primarily phospholipid surfactant , and surfactant 
apoproteins in the distal air spaces.  Consequently gas transfer  is decreased leading to 
impairment of gas exchange , respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399],  and to increased risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776] [1,3,4,5]. More than 90% of the reported cases of PAP are classified as the 
autoimmune disorder type associated with GM -CSF autoantibodies  (aPAP) . Less common 
are the secondary and congenital types [4,5]. 
The clinical presentation for PAP is variable and nonspecific  with subacute symptoms of 
cough, dyspnoea, activity intolerance, occasional chest pain, and general malaise. Although 
PAP spans all ages, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_812868] [ADDRESS_1125630] the above 
symptoms for less than seven months; another 25% of patients report having symptoms of 
two years or longer. Up to a third of the PAP cases may be minimally symptomatic  [6]. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_812869] a restrictive pattern of ventilatory defect ; the 
pulmonary diffusing capacity is reduced, out of proportion with the fall in vital capacity (VC) 
[7,8,9]. Arterial blood gas analysis shows mild to moderate hypox aemia, with an elevated 
alveolar -arterial gradient and elevation in shunt fraction [6,8,10]. Analysis of B roncho 
Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) may facilitate the diagnosis in clinically suspected cases. The 
BALF may have a ‘milky’ appearance, with large amounts of granular, acellular eosinophilic 
lipoproteinaceous material which is PAS positive [ 11,12].  
No evidence- based curative treatment exists for patients with PAP. There is , therefore , a 
need for new and modern treatment approaches for PAP patients . Sequential whole lung 
lavage (WLL) under general anesthesia has become the standard of care. Whole Lung 
Lavage decreases the symptoms and improves the oxygenation in PAP patients . It is not 
possible to predict  how many WLL treatments a particular patient will need; a single WLL is 
sufficient for some pati ents while others require lavage every six  to 12 months for many 
years.  The observation that mice deficient in the gene for GM -CSF develop alveolar 
accumulations of surfactant substances similar to that seen in PAP led to the suggestion of a 
potential role for recombinant human GM -CSF ( rhGM -CSF) in the treatment of PAP [13]. 
It is generally accepted today that once the disease is diagnosed its outcome appears  to be 
much better compared to old, historical data.  Overall disease specific survival rates exceed 
80% at five years [14,15].  
The most common cause of death is respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], typi[INVESTIGATOR_812870]. Secondary pulmonary infections with bacteria and other organisms 
occasionally develop due to  impaired macrophage function; thes e infections require 
extensive treatment.  
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)  
The IMP, Molgramostim nebuliser solution, has initially been developed by [CONTACT_812905] A/S and is now further developed by [CONTACT_812906].  
The drug substance molgramostim ( rhGM -CSF) is produced in E. coli and has the same 
amino acid sequence as the native protein but is not glycosylated.  Another rhGM -CSF 
Clinical Trial Protocol  Sponsor: Savara ApS  
Version: 5.0  Trial Code: MOL- PAP- 002 
Date: [ADDRESS_1125631] been approved largely for use  following 
chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation to  reduce the risk s of neutropenia such 
as infection or graft rej ection.  Molgramostim  has been marketed  in Europe and Australia as 
Leucomax®. However i t was discontinued in 2002 for unknown reasons. Sargramostim, as 
Leukine®, is currently approved by [CONTACT_3133] ( FDA) for use in five 
indications at a dose  of 250 µg /m2 per day using intravenous  (IV) and/or subcutaneous 
administration depending on indication [ 16]. It is reported by [CONTACT_812907] 
(MA) holder that approximately 470,[ADDRESS_1125632] launch i n March 1991 through December 
2012 [ 17]. 
 
Pre-clinical studies in cynomolgus monkeys show that rhGM -CSF is deposited in the lungs 
after inhalation of molgramostim. The small fraction of the inhaled dose that is absorbed 
causes increases in stem cell proliferation, resulting in increased number of monocytes and 
neutrophils in the circulation; s imilar to the known effects after IV administration of 
molgramostim.  
 
Increases in incidence or severity of inflammatory cell infiltration, b ronchi -associated 
lymphoid tissue (BALT ) hyperplasia, pleural inflammation, and granulomas were similar 
across animals treated with 42 µg/kg/day and those treated with 127 µg/kg/day , likely due to 
anti-drug antibodies . These findings were not associated with any clinically impaired 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_812871] a [ADDRESS_1125633] item cannot be excluded, 
these findings were likely a consequence of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedure, 
which was conducted pre -treatment  and at termination in every animal from this study. This 
is supported by [CONTACT_812908] 40 
µg/kg/day for [ADDRESS_1125634] Level (NOAEL) was based on the clinical severity of the 
bronchopneumonia in the monkey treated with 127 μg/kg/day, as opposed to the incidental 
histopathologic finding of bronchopneumonia without clinical signs in the animal treated with 
42 μg/kg/day, and consequently was set at the 40 μg/kg/day nominal dose level. This was 
subsequently confirmed by [CONTACT_812909] (up to 26 weeks), 
where no bronchopneumonia was reported and no additional dose- limiting toxicity was 
observed.  
Safety margins for local lung burden, that derive from the NOAEL at 40 μ g/kg/day and that 
take into consideration the differences in lung deposition between monkeys and man, are 
around [ADDRESS_1125635]. Safety margins based on a comparison of 
the plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) between monkeys (at the 
NOAEL) and volunteers from a phase I clinical  trial are around [ADDRESS_1125636].  Further details are available in the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). 
 
The first clinical study with molgramostim nebuliser solution has recently been completed 
(MOL -001). This was a phase I study  to investigate the effects of molgramostim nebul iser 
solution in healthy adult subjects. The study was a randomised, double- blind, placebo-
controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to assess 
the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in 42 adult s non tobacco 
using male and non- child bearing female subjects. In the SAD part, 18 subjects were

Confidential  Page 23 of 83 included with four subjects in each of the three  SAD dose levels (150 µg, 300 µg and 600 µg)  
and six receivi ng placebo. In the MAD part , 24 subjects were included with nine subjects in 
each of the two  MAD dose levels ( 300 µg or 600 µg) and six receiving placebo once daily for 
six days.  
 
All 42 subjects enrolled completed the study.  GM-CSF was not measurable in serum  before 
study drug administration.  In the SAD part, GM-CSF was absorbed into systemic circulation 
with t max of 2 hours  after inhalation of molgramostim nebuli ser solution, h owever, at pic ogram 
levels 50 -100 times lower than has been observed after similar doses of sargramostim 
administered intravenously.  Total systemic exposure (AUC last) increased with dose ranging 
between 13 and 138 pg •h/mL and Cmax ranged between 9.1 and 41 pg/mL ( Cmax was similar 
for the 300 and 600 μg dose levels ). In the MAD part, despi[INVESTIGATOR_812872] 4 hours where GM -CSF levels returned to levels below quantification limits 
after each dose,  there was evidence of  some  accumulation after multiple dosing. C max 
increased from 32 pg/mL on Day 1 to 90 pg/mL on Day 6 for the 300 μ g dose level and from 
96 pg/mL to 251 pg/mL from Day s [ADDRESS_1125638] 
increased from 97 to 248 pg •h/mL from Day s 1 to 6 for the 300 μg dose level and from 350 to 
802 pg •h/mL for the 600 μg dose level. Minimum  measurable  plasma concentrations (C min) 
on Day 6 were 3.6 and 5.1 pg/mL measured at 8 and 12 hours, respectively  for the 300 and 
600 μg dose levels.  
Changes in white blood cells  (WBC)  and differential counts were in- line with the mode -of-action 
of GM -CSF and these were not clinically significant in most subjects.  In subjects  treated with 
molgramostim nebuliser solution a slight increase in total WBC and differential counts 
(primarily within normal reference  ranges) was observed in a dose- dependent manner.  Two 
subjects had adverse events ( AEs) concerning WBC differential counts that were considered 
related to GM -CSF (eosinophilia and white blood cell count increased) . Additionally , inhalation 
of molgramostim nebuliser solution resulted  in increases in  exhaled fraction of nitric oxide 
(FeNO) compared with placebo.  
The most common AE was cough, reported for 21/30 (70%) subjects receiving molgramostim 
nebuliser solution and 8/12 (67%) receiving placebo. The AEs considered treatment -related 
reported by [CONTACT_812910] (>5%) subjects receiving molgramostim nebuliser solution were:  
cough (50%), productive cough (10%) and headache (6.7%). Cough was considered 
treatment -related for  a similar proportion  of subjects receivi ng placebo (58%).  Number of 
cough events  were  48 in  30 subjects in  the combined molgramostim  groups  and 15 in 12 
subjects  in the placebo groups. A higher number of treatment -related AEs were observed in 
the 600 μ g dose level compared to the 300 μg dose lev el and placebo in the MAD part.  
There were no serious adverse events  (SAEs) , severe AEs, dose -limiting toxicity,  or other 
remarkable findings of clinical concern from review  of clinical safety data. Further details are 
available in the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). 
 
Previous experience of inhaled rhGM-CSF in PAP patients  
Based on the findings that PAP may be caused by [CONTACT_812911] -CSF, off- label 
administration of subcutaneous and inhaled rhGM -CSF in the marketed formulations 
(molgramo stim and s argramostim) has already been explored in the clinic. The results have 
indicated that therapy with rhGM -CSF can offer  an effective and safe treat ment for the 
patient with aPAP. In a recent meta -analysis, including three subcutaneous studies and two 
inhalat ion studies, a 59% pooled response rate was calculated with a higher response 
observed with inhalation use [ 2].  
The majority of aPAP patients participating in published clinical studies using inhaled 
rhGM -CSF have been treated with s argramostim (approximately 70 patients). Improved 
pulmonary function was reported from all studies. In three of the six studies the alv eolar-
arterial oxygen difference ( (A-a)DO 2) has been assessed as a measure of response to

Confidential  Page 24 of 83 treatment. In one trial of 39 patients, a mean reduction of 12.3 (8.4 -16.2) mmHg  (p<0.001) 
was observed in the 35 patients that completed the trial  [18]. A reduction of 12.[ADDRESS_1125640] (p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) and 20 mmHg  at exercise from 12 patients was reported in another trial [19] 
and a recent trial [20] report ed a mean decrease of 17.4 mmHg  (p=0.031). Patients also 
experienced improvement in dyspno ea (BDS), exercise tolerance assessed by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1125641] (6MWT ), pulmonary function tests such as Diffusion  Capacity of the Lungs for 
Carbon Monoxide (DLCO), Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_117067] (FEV), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), 
Total Lung Capacity (TLC), C omputer Tomography ( CT) scans, and nutritional status.  In line 
with thes e results there are reports of less need for further WLLs and that patients have been 
able to come off supplementary oxygen; f our out of five patients in one  trial did not require 
any further WLL during the course of the trial and the remaining patient had a diminished 
need for WLL for six months and then required no further WLL [ 21]. All five patients were 
able to discontinue supplemental oxygen. The results from the performed studies indicates 
an improvement that remains present for more than one year after treatment  has been 
discontinued [18,19]. 
Molgramostim  nebuliser solution has not, as yet, been used in aPAP in the clinical setting. 
However, data are  available from eight aPAP patients in which molgramostim  products other 
than molgramostim nebuliser solution have been administered via inhalation [ 22, 23, 24, 25]. 
The treatment duration for all patients was 24 weeks or more. Three different treatment 
regimen s applied; three patients received 250 µg/day every other week for 24 weeks, four 
patients received 150 µg/day for 24 weeks, and one patient received 300 µg/day every other 
week for three  months , followed by 150 µg/day every other week for six  months. In the first 
trial, a  decrease between 17 and 27 mmHg  in (A-a)DO 2 was reported for the three  patients  
included [22]. In another trial a decrease in (A -a)DO 2 by [CONTACT_726] 10 mmHg was reported in 
two out of four patients, improved VC and C T score was reported in all four  patients  and 
improved DLCO, Medical Research Council ( MRC ) grade (subjective dyspno ea index) and 
Krebs von den Lungen - 6 (KL-6) were  reported in three  out of four patients [ 23]. After three 
months treatment every other week with 300 µg/day rhGM -CSF the patient studied by [CONTACT_812912] 2014 had an arterial oxy gen tension (PaO 2) of [ADDRESS_1125642] [ 25].  
More details about the clinical studies and case reports using i nhaled rhGM-CSF are 
available in the IB.  
This is the first trial sponsored by [CONTACT_812913]  (molgramostim nebuliser 
solution) is administered to PAP patients.   
5.2 Trial  Rationale  
Today’s  standard of care , WLL, does not correct the primary defect  in aPAP but provides 
symptomatic benefit to many patients. W hole Lung Lavage is complex to perform , requires 
prolonged general anaesthesia, is associated with morbidities . In addition, a single WLL is 
not effective in all patients. Consequently, there is a need for more effective and less 
invasive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812873]  [2].  
As outlined above, there is a growing body of evidence indicat ing that rhGM-CSF 
(molgramostim and s argramostim) may have a positive impact on lung function and 
morphology in aPAP patients.  
 
The current trial  has been designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a molgramostim 
formulation specific ally developed for inhalation ( molgramostim nebuliser solution) in aPAP 
patients. The trial design is a randomised, double- blind , parallel group comparison of inhaled 
molgramostim  with placebo. The trial consists of a Double- blind treatment period of up to 
24 weeks to determine the compa rative efficacy and safety  of molgramostim. After the 
Clinical Trial Protocol  Sponsor: Savara ApS  
Version: 5.0  Trial Code: MOL- PAP- 002 
Date: [ADDRESS_1125643] treatment Follow –up period of up to 
[ADDRESS_1125644] comparative design . The use of a placebo arm controls for the natural course of 
disease and allow s the trial to be powered for statistical significance despi[INVESTIGATOR_812874].  
 
The primary endpoint  is (A-a)DO 2, which has been found to be sensitive to treatment with 
inhaled rhGM -CSF with a low degree of variability  in previous  literature . In a phase 2 trial the 
statistically significant improvement in ( A- a)DO 2 was accompanied by [CONTACT_812914], need for oxygen supplement, walking distance and minimal 
oxygen saturation ( SpO 2) on the 6MWT, VC and DLCO  [18]. Improvements were also 
associated with morphologic changes as evidenced by [CONTACT_812915]- resolution CT scores and (A -a)DO 2, PaO [ADDRESS_1125645] (A -a)DO [ADDRESS_1125646]-procedure infections and pneumothorax [ 26]. Therefore , a reduced requirement for  WLL 
would be of benefit for the patient . As the main symptom of aPAP is exercise- induced 
dyspnoea that may limit the activity level of t he patient, the 6  Minute Walk Distance ( 6MWD ) 
and the total score on SGRQ were chosen as key secondary endpoints, although data on 
these endpoints in aPAP are still limited. In addition, pulmonary function and disease severity 
based on HR -CT scoring will a ssessed as secondary  endpoints.  
 
The patient population to be included in the current trial will be patients with aPAP , which 
accounts for over 90% of PAP cases . Patients with congenital and secondary PAP will not be 
included. Congenital PAP is often associated with a receptor defect so these patients would 
be unlikely to benefit from rhGM -CSF treatment and treating the underlying cause of 
secondary PAP is usually sufficient to resolve the disease.  Diagnosi s of PAP will be by [CONTACT_812916]-resolution com puter tomography (HR -CT), by [CONTACT_812917], or by 
[CONTACT_812918] ( BAL) in accordance with current clinical practice. Increased serum 
anti-GM-CSF will be required for confirmation of the autoimmune disease type. Patients with 
aPAP confirmed to be stable or progressive during a period of at least two months prior to 
Baseline will be eligible for treatment .  Patients whose condition is spontaneously improving  
(defined as absolute VC improved by [CONTACT_726] 5% and/or DLCO improved by  [CONTACT_726] 
10%)  during a period of at least two  month s prior to Baseline will be excluded.  
 
The sample size calculation for the primary endpoint required a total of 42 subjects (14 in 
each treatment group) to be randomised.  It was also based on previous assumptions about 
how the trial would be analysed (notably, to combine the two active doses together for the 
primary analysis). In order to power the study also to have potential to show effects on the 
key secondary endpoints, additional sample size calculations were conducted and the 
sample size was set at [ADDRESS_1125647]  completed 24 -weeks of treatment.

Confidential  Page 26 of 83 The p ublished rhGM -CSF inhalation studies  (mainly sargramostim)  in aPAP have utili sed 
many different doses , dosing schedules  and nebulisers . Doses  used  include 150 µg 
rhGM -CSF daily , 125 µg twice daily (b. i.d), 250 µg daily,  and 500 µg b.i.d. [19, 20, 21, 22, 
23]. Most studies have employed intermittent treatment, most commonly treatment every 
other week (eow), or four days on, four days off treatment. Cyclic dosing with seven days 
on/seven days off was introduced in a phase 1  clinical inhalation trial in oncology  [28]. The 
main reason for this cyclic dosing schedule was to reduce potential pulmonary toxicity and 
damage to local tissues. Another reason was that data from granulocyte- colony stimulating 
factor (G -CSF) treatment had shown a peak increase in peripheral blood progenitor cells 
(PBPC)  on Days [ADDRESS_1125649] day s for six months or 
more [ 21], more than eight months with two week s on/two weeks off treatment , and eow for 
up to 32 weeks  (up to 64 weeks in a single patient ) [18,19,21,29,30].  
 
Due to the wide range of dose regimens used, two different dose regimens of molgramostim  
will be investigated in the current trial . One regimen will be continuous administration of 
molgramostim  300 µg once daily for 24 weeks and the other regimen  will be intermittent 
administration (12 cycles of seven days molgramostim  300 µg, seven days placebo; both 
administered once daily ). The placebo group will receive continuous daily treatment.  Most 
studies have employed a treatment duration of at least [ADDRESS_1125650] to gas exchange has been  found to be 24 weeks and a lag time of 
4-12 weeks until efficacy is seen has been reported [ 1,19]. Therefore , the proposed 
treatment duration of [ADDRESS_1125651] studies [ 18, 19], 
which were conducted with sargramostim  (only limited data are available for molgramostim ). 
Both studies reported the percentage of responders in terms of improvement of at least 
10-12 mmHg in (A -a)DO 2. The percentage of responders was 62% with a daily dose of 250 
µg for 12 weeks, followed by 125 µg  for 12 weeks [ 18] and >90% with a daily dose of 500 µg 
[19]. The responder rates were supported by [CONTACT_812919]. There were no signs of dose -related toxicity in these 
studies.   
 
Based on these data with sargramostim, possible differences in biological activity and the 
nebuliser used must be taken into account  when selecting an appropriate dose of 
molgramostim . In vitro data  indicated a potency difference between the two compounds of 
0.6-0.8 [31, 32], thus a dose of [ADDRESS_1125652] s who complete the 24- week Double- blind 
treatment period (regardless of whether they completed trial treatment or discontinued trial 
treatment prematurely)  will enter the open -label period so that as much information as 
possible can be collected regarding the use of molgramostim  in this rare disease. During the 
open- label Follow-up period subject s will be treated with molgramostim 300 µg daily in an 
intermittent regimen of 7 days on-  and 7 days off -treatment. The data from the open -label 
Follow -up period will be analysed descriptively and reported separately.

Date: [ADDRESS_1125653] treatment without a targeted pathophysiological approach. 
WLL is an intervention which carries a high morbidity, treats only symptoms, and is not 
always successful. Due to the pathophysiology of aPAP, this condition can lead to 
complications, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], pulmonary fibrosis and potentially  premat ure 
death.  
There is currently no approved pharmacological treatment for patients with PAP, and 
therefore an unmet need for further treatment modalities exists.  
Experience with inhaled rhGM -CSF worldwide has demonstrated a reduction in symptoms  
and improvement in exercise tolerance and objective lung function tests , reducing or 
eliminating further WLL epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Thus treatment  with rhGM -CSF has the potential to alter 
the natural history of PAP [ 14, 33].  
Clinical studies and case reports thus far have indicated the use of inhaled rhGM -CSF to be 
a well-tolerated, effective and locali sed treatment  that may offer clinical benefits for the great 
majority of patients , including clearance of excess surfactant -related lipoproteins and 
prevention of secondary infections [ 24, 26]. 
Patients with aPAP have been treated with up to 500 µg of inhaled rhGM -CSF for up to a 
year [21, 30, 34, 35]. There have been no reports of chronic toxic effects [19].  
Results from pre- clinical studies with inhaled molgramostim nebuliser solution showed the 
expected pharmacological effects on WBC populations locally and systemically  in line with 
observed effects after IV administration of molgramostim. No severe, serious or dose- limiting 
AEs were observed in the first clinical study in humans (MOL- 001). The most common AE 
was cough, which was reported at a similar incidence for the m olgramostim nebuliser 
solution and placebo. Increases of WBC populations in the blood consistent with the known 
mechanism of action were observed; most of which were considered not clinically significant. 
Only two cases ( total white blood cell  increased and eosinophilia) were reported as AEs . No 
development of anti -drug antibodies was observed.  
Based on information from similar products, the potential dose -limiting toxicity of 
molgramostim  would be based on pulmonary effects, such as bronchoconstriction, 
dyspnoea, cough or decreased pulmonary function. Pulmonary function and respi[INVESTIGATOR_812875]- blind trial treatment should be 
discontinued if significant worsening  occurs . If there is significant systemic exposure,  
haematologic findings such as leucocytosis and neutrophilia may occur. Therefore,  
laboratory safety monitoring will be conducted during the D ouble- blind treatment  period.  As 
non-clinical data on similar products indicate that systemic exposure to rhGM -CSF may be 
associated with increased pre - and post -implantation losses,  pregnancy testing will be 
performed in women of childbearing potential prior to dosing , at monthly intervals during the 
Double- blind treatment period and the open -label treatment Follow -up period.  
Treatment with molgramostim  nebuliser solution is expected to be more effective, less 
invasive, and more convenient, than the currently available symptomatic treatmen t, WLL, for  
patients with aPAP.  In the current trial two t hirds of the subject s will receive active drug and 
one third will receive placebo.  Rescue treatment  with WLL will be available for all subject s 
who experience any unacceptable lack of response or disease progression during the trial. 
Subject s requiring WLL during the D ouble- blind treatment period will continue trial treatment .

7.1 Trial  Design and Plan- Description  
A Screening V isit will be conducted 14 days ( ±7 days) prior to the Baseline V isit to determine 
eligibility. Subject s with aPAP  confirmed to be stable or progressive during a period of at 
least two months prior to the Baseline Visit will be eligible for treatment . Subject s are not 
eligible for treatment if spontaneous remission  has occur ed during this two- month period,  
defined as  absolute VC improved by  [CONTACT_726] 5% and/or DLCO improved by  [CONTACT_726] 
10%.  
At the Baseline V isit, eligible subject s will be  randomised to receive treatment for up to 24 
weeks with either:  
1) inhaled molgramostim  (300 µg) administered once daily,   
2) inhaled molgramostim  (300 µg) and matching placebo administered intermittently 
(12 cycles of seven days molgramostim, seven days placebo; both administered once 
daily) or  
3) inhaled placebo administered once daily.  
The trial will include two phases; a Double- blind treatment period consisting of up to eight  
trial visits ( Screening, Baseline, and at Weeks 4,  8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 after randomisation) 
and an open -label treatment  Follow -up period consisting of up to five trial visits (at Weeks [ADDRESS_1125660] -treatment). The [ADDRESS_1125661] any concerns ( Figure 1). 
During the trial, WLL will be applied as rescue therapy.  The criterion for performing WLL is 
clinical worsening of aPAP based on symptoms, reduced exercise capacity and/or findings of 
hypox emia or desaturation according to the Investigator’s judgement. The reason(s) for 
conducting WLL will be documented . Subject s undergoing WLL during the Double- blind 
treatment period will continue double- blind  trial treatment . All subject s completing the 24-
week Double- blind treatment period will enter a [ADDRESS_1125662] s who 
require further treatment will be offered treatment with molgramostim in a Compassionate 
Use Programme, where national regulations so allow.

withdrawal of subject s from th e trial are:  
• Screening failure  
• The decision of a subject  to withdraw from  the trial (including if the subject  withdraw s 
informed consent)   
• Subject  is lost to Follow -up 
• Other reason(s)  
The reason and date the subject  is withdrawn from the trial will be documented i n the 
electronic case report form ( eCRF) (e.g. lost to Follow -up, consent withdrawn, incorrect 
enrolment , AEs, etc.). If a subject  is withdrawn from the trial, t he investigator should attempt 
to complete all required trial assessments  (such as those at Week 24 if withdrawn during the 
Double- blind treatment period) .  
All AEs should be followed- up according to Section 11.2.  
If a subject  is withdrawn from  the trial, all data collected until the time of withdrawal will be 
used in the analyses.  
Subject s who withdraw before randomisation will be considered screen  failures.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_1125688] s may be discontinued from double- blind treatment and assessments at any time, if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator.   
Potential reasons for discontinuation of double- blind treatment are :  
• Lack of efficacy /worsening of disease  
• Unacceptable AE

Confidential  Page 46 of 83 • Serious hypersensitivity reaction 
• Pregnancy  
Those who discontinue double- blind treatment will not  automatically be withdrawn from the 
trial but will be encouraged to continue to follow the same visit schedule.   
For example: if double- blind treatment is  discontinued at Week 8 (Visit 4) the subject  will be 
encouraged to attend the remaining visits  in the Double- blind treatment period (Weeks 12, 
16, 20 and 24) and continue into the Follow -up period.  If the subject  is reluctant to agree to 
4-weekly  visits, the investigator should request attendance at Week 24 (Visit 8) as a 
minimum .  
The reason and date the subject  is discontinued from double- blind treatment  will be 
documented in the eCRF.  
Subject s who fulfil the criteria for rescue treatment will be scheduled for a WLL as described 
in Section 9.4. Subject s receiving a WLL  should continue D ouble- blind treatment and  attend 
the remaining visits in the Double- blind treatment period and then continue into the Follow -up 
period.  
8.5 Premature Termination  of the Trial  
The investigator or the s ponsor may terminate this trial  prematurely  for any reasonable 
cause. The Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) and Competent  Authorities  (CAs) should 
be informed promptly .  
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subject s

• inhaled molgramostim  (300 µg) administered once daily,  
• inhaled molgramostim  (300 µg) and matching placebo administered intermittently (12 
cycles of seven days molgramostim  followed by  [CONTACT_812926]; both 
administered once daily) or  
• inhaled placebo administered once daily.  
In the Follow -up period all subjects will receive treatment with inhaled molgramostim (300 µg) 
administered intermittently (12 or 24 cycles of seven days molgramostim followed by [CONTACT_812927] -treatment ) for 24 or 48 weeks . For subjects who entered the Follow -up period before 
Amendment 11 was approved by [CONTACT_812923], treatment with molgramostim in the 
Follow -up period is not mandatory.  
Treatment with molgramostim in the Follow -up period should be discontinued in case of 
disease worsening and/or safety concerns.

Each vial of molgramostim contains 250 µg/mL molgramostim  in 1.[ADDRESS_1125693]   
All manufacturing and packaging will be  performed  in accordance with current Good 
Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ).  
Individual medication kits containing double- blind trial medication for one week  will be 
supplied in adequate amounts at the dispensing visits . Every kit will be labelled with a unique 
medication number, which also appear on a tear -off part of the label.   
Labels will comply with local regulations and will be printed in local language.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1125694] be stored at 2-8°C.   
The IMP will be stored at the trial  site or the at the site pharmacy as required by [CONTACT_812928].  The Investigator will ensure that the IMP will 
be stored in appropriate conditions in a secure location with controlled access. The storage 
compartment must be monitored and the temperature documented. Any deviations in storage 
temperature must be r eported to  sponsor without delay. In case of a temperature deviation, 
the IMP  must not be used until acceptance from the sponsor.  
The IMP kits will be dispensed to the subject  at Baseline (Visit 2), and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 
and 20 (Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) during the Double -blind treatment period.  
Unblinded IMP kits will be dispensed to the subject at Week [ADDRESS_1125695]-randomisation and at

defined by a 30L mesh and an aerosol chamber that can produce aerosols with high density 
of active drug, precisely defined droplet size and a high proportion of respi[INVESTIGATOR_812880].  
All subject s, investigators and trial nurses will be trained in IMP administration and medical 
device maintenance procedure. The training of the subject s will be arranged prior to 
administration of the subject ’s first dose of IMP  and checked in clinic on first dosi ng. The 
subject  will also receive written instructions.  
The subject  will administer the first dose of IMP post randomis ation at the Baseline visit (Visit

note that the occurrence of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) should not routinely precipi[INVESTIGATOR_812881]. If the treating physician cons iders it necessary to 
unblind the study medication for medical reasons, unblinding can be done using IWRS –  and 
if possible, after prior contact [CONTACT_28994]. The date and the event making it necessary 
to unblind the treatment randomization have to be documented in the patient files and in the 
case report form (CRF). The Sponsor will immediately be notified in case of emergency 
unblinding by [CONTACT_812931]. In the case of a potential s uspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R ) for an individual subject, Premier Research  may break the blind.  
All investigational sites and the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Representative (Premier 
Research) have access to unblinding in the IWRS.  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will review unblinded safety data as part of the 
safety surveillance of the trial. A statistician from TFS who is independent from the trial will 
make the unblinded safety and tolerability data listings available to the DSMB  according to 
TFS SOPs and the Statistical Analysis Plan . All study team members will remain blinded.  
Unblinding of t he clinical trial will take place when a final validated database for the 24-week 
double- blind  period has been produced, the statistical analysis specified in this protoc ol has 
been reviewed in relation to the blinded data actually obtained and the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) has been approved.  
9.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
The use of concomitant medicines or other treatment regimen dur ing the 24-week Double-
blind  treatment period should be kept at a minimum and should be kept as stable as 
possible.  Medication/ treatment , which is considered necessary for subject  safety and well -
being, may be given at the discretion of the i nvestigator . Examples of such 
medications/treatments are:  
• WLL (rescue therapy) - The criteria for performing WLL is clinical worsening of aPAP 
based on symptoms, reduced exercise capacity and/or findings of hypoxemia or 
desaturation according to the Investigator’s judgement. The reason(s) for conducting 
WLL will be documented .  
• Oxygen supplementation  
Sputum modifying medications such as carbocystein and ambroxol  are prohibited for 
participating subject s in the Double- blind period of this trial. Medications detailed in the 
exclusion criteria which are r ituximab and therapy  associated with significant 
immunosuppression are also not allowed (e.g. more than 10mg/day systemic prednisolone)  
while the subject is treated with IMP in the Double- blind or Follow -up periods . Other rhGM -
CSF products are not allowed during the Double- blind or Follow -up periods.  
For subject s who discontinue the double- blind trial treatment and for all subjects in the 
Follow -up period,  use of medications to specifically treat aPAP  will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Information will be collected regarding:  
• concomitant medications, treatments and procedures used to treat aPAP  
• medication or treatments which may alter the course of aPAP  
• medication or treatments used to treat AEs  
No other in formation on concomitant medications, treatments or procedures in the Follow -up 
period will be collected.

5-point scale ( no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, 
and extreme problems ) will be used in the local language , Appendix B . This 
instrument will be  used to measure overall self -rated health status .  
10.1.8   Disease Severity  Score 
The DSS will be assessed at the timepoints shown in Table 1. 
The DSS is based on the presence of symptoms and degree of reduction in PaO 2 
determined with the individual breathing room air in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]  [37]. 
The DSS is a 5 -point score as follows:  
1 = no symptoms and PaO 2 ≥ 70 mmHg   
2 = symptomatic and PaO 2 ≥ 70 mmHg  
3 = 60 mmHg  ≤ PaO 2 < 70 mmHg  
4 = 50 mmHg  ≤ PaO 2 < 60 mmHg  
5 = PaO 2 < [ADDRESS_1125720] breathing room 
air (see 10.1.1). For subjects requiring supplemental oxygen during the blood gas 
assessment the DSS will be based on the PaO 2 obtained while breathing oxygen.

Any AEs  will be reported  during the trial period from Baseline (Visit 2) to the completion of 
the 24- week or 48- week  Follow -up visits (Visit  11 and 13). The subject s will be encouraged 
to contact [CONTACT_812935]. For 
further information of definitions and reporting of AEs and SAEs, see Section  11.  
A Diary Card will be g iven to the subject  at start of treatment at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) 
and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 (Visits 3, 4, 5, 6  and 7)  at Weeks 12, 24 and 36 of the 
Follow -up period ( Visits 10,11 and 12) . In the Diary Card  the subject  will record any AEs and 
answer specific questions regarding potential pulmonary and systemic effects.  The 
completed Diary Card will be collected at the next clinic visit (Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 10, 11, 12 
and 13) . At these visits , the investigator will evaluate the safety information on the Diary Card

will be provided to the site personnel.  The manual will be provided to the site before start of 
the trial.  
Blood samples for efficacy and safety assessments will be taken at all visits, except for Visit 
9, which is a telephone follow -up. For the D ouble- blind period of 24 weeks the amount of 
blood required per patient  per visit varies between 10 mL and 53 mL pr. visit.  The total 
amount needed for the Double- blind  period is approximately 25 0 mL . For the Follow -up 
period of 24 or 4 8 weeks the total am ount of blood required per patient is approximately 85

treatment.  
Comment:  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1125735] and unintended responses to an IMP  related to any dose administered.  
Comment:  All AEs judged by [CONTACT_5640] t he reporting i nvestigator or the sponsor as having a 
reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse drug reactions. The 
expression reasonable causal relationship means that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility i.e. the relationship cannot 
be ruled out.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_1125736] information (e.g. IB for an unauthorised IMP or summary of product characteristics 
for an authorised product).  
Comment:  When the outcome of the adverse reaction is not consistent with the applicable 
product information this adverse reaction should be considered as unexpected.

• Result s in death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• May jeopardise  the subject or may require intervention to prevent one or more of the 
other outcomes listed above (Important Medical Events ) 
Comments: Life-threatening in the definition of a SAE or serious adverse reaction refers to 
an event in which the subject  was at r isk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it w as more severe.  
For important medical events, m edical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether 
an AE/reaction is serious . 
The severity of an adverse reaction is largely determined by [CONTACT_812937]. An adverse reaction should only be termed "s erious" if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812889] a result of it. As a rule, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812890] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812891].

alone without subsequent in- patient admission does not yet fulfill the criterion hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343639]. 
However, it should be confirmed whether any of the other criteria mentioned above justifies 
an adverse reaction being classified as "serious" or at least "medically significant.  
If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE with a reasonable relationship to the IMP  after 
the s ubject has left the trial, this SAE must also be reported (post -trial event).   
11.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is an AE which  
• has a reasonable possibility of causal relationship to an IMP,  
• is serious; and  
• is unexpected 
Therefore , due to the nature and /or severity of the adver se reaction,  a S[LOCATION_003]R is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (i.e. the  reference safety information in the 
IB) for the IMP used in this study.  
11.[ADDRESS_1125739] s will be carefully monitored for the occurrence of AEs during the trial  period 
from Screening (Visit 1) to the completion of the 48-week  Follow -up visit (Visit  13). The 
investigator will collect AEs with a non- leading question such as “have you experienced any 
new health problems or worsening of existing conditions” as well as reporting events directly 
observed or spontaneously volunteered by [CONTACT_1130] s. 
Clearly related signs, symptoms and abnormal diagnostic proc edure results should be 
grouped together and reported as a single diagnosis or syndrome whenever possible.  
All AEs including but not limited to events reported by [CONTACT_423] , or reported in answer to 
an open question by [CONTACT_812938], which fall into any of the above 
definitions must be recorded as an  AE in the eCRF and should include the following 
information:  
• Brief description of the event (diagnosis)  
• Start date (and time, if relevant)  
• Stop date (and time, if relevant) (or resolution)  
• Severity  
• Action taken regarding trial drug 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_67235] c ausality  
• Seriousness  
Outcome  
Severity  
Severity describes the intensity of an event, and will be assessed as:  
Mild 
The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity.  
Clinical Trial Protocol  Sponsor: Savara ApS  
Version: 5.0 Trial Code: MOL- PAP- 002 
Date: [ADDRESS_1125740] No.: 2015- [ADDRESS_1125741] is still able to function. Medical 
intervention may be considered.  
Severe 
The AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention.  
If an AE changes in severity, it should be reported as an AE of new severity but with the 
same description . 
Causality  
Causality will be assessed as : 
Probable 
A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the IMP, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallenge information is not required to fulfil this definition.  
Possible  
A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the IMP, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_19009]. Information on IMP  withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely  
A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to IMP  
administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, 
chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not applicable  
This assessment can be used e.g. in cases where the subject did not receive any treatment 
with IMP or if the causality cannot be judged because information is insufficient or 
contradictory.  
Outcome  
The outcome of AEs  has to be described by [CONTACT_12294]:  
• Recovered  
• Not Recovered  
• Recovered with sequelae 
• Fatal 
• Unknown.  
Follow -up of Subject s after Adverse Events 
Any AE that is ongoing when the subject  is withdrawn fr om the trial  should be followed- up 
until the AE is resolved or the investigator decides that the AE is stable and needs no further 
Follow -up.

An asymptomatic abnormal laboratory /vital sign  finding should only be reported as an AE if it 
is clinicall y significant  according to the investigator’s assessment , if it fulfils the criteria for an 
SAE or if it causes the subject  to discontinue the trial. 
If an abnormal laboratory /vital sign  value is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the

procedure.  
After that period of time  only serious adverse reactions (events related to study medication) 
have to be reported. SAEs occurring to a patient after the patient has completed the clinical 
trial and for which a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship is assessed by [CONTACT_3786], must be reported by [CONTACT_812939] (post -trial events). The SAE form has to be completed in English.  
Initial reports should be followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_197133]. The initial 
and Follow -up reports should identify subject s by [CONTACT_812940]. 
The subject s’ names, personal identification numbers, and/or addresses  must not be 
included. The following information is mandatory  for the initial report:  
• Subject  trial ID 
• Trial treatment (blinded, if applicable)  
• Start date (time, if relevant) of the trial  treatment  
• Brief description of the event (diagnosis)  
• Start date (time, if relevant) of the event  
• Seriousness criteria  
• Causality as sessment

completed the 24- week Double- blind period.  
A separate SAP, which will provide the technical details of the statistical analysis outlined 
below, will be prepared for use in conjunction with this protocol . 
Before the trial is unblinded, a blind review of the data will be completed. At that time, 
adjustments to the planned analyses may be identified based on, for example, the extent and 
timing of missing data . Confirmation of eligibility for analysis p opulations (see Section 12.1.1 ) 
will be confirmed at this time.  
The data from the open- label Follow -up period will be presented descriptively.  
The following details are related to the randomised, double- blind portion of the trial . 
12.1.[ADDRESS_1125754]  population sets are defined as follows:  
Full analysis set (FAS):  All randomised  subject s. 
Per-protocol set (PPS):  All randomised  subject s who have completed Visit [ADDRESS_1125755] no important  protocol deviations that could interfere with the objectives of 
this trial. This is a sub- population of the FAS.  
Note : Important deviations of eligibility criteria and other deviations f rom the protocol will be 
assessed  by [CONTACT_812943]. Important deviations from the protocol 
may lead to exclusion of a subject  from the PPS. All such decisions will be made and 
documented before the trial  database is unblinded.  
Safety set: All randomised subject s who received  at least one dose of the study medication.  
Although efficacy summaries will be performed on both the FAS and the PPS, the FAS will 
be considered the primary analysis population.  
Safety summaries will be perf ormed on the safety set.  
12.1.[ADDRESS_1125756] p- values (to four decimal places) will be calculated and 
quoted.   
 
There is one primary efficacy parameter although there are three key secondary efficacy 
endpoints which are intended to support conclusions based on the primary parameter . In 
addition, several other endpoi nts will be considered as descriptive and supportive, and no 
adjustments for multiplicity will be made for these analyses . 
 
Two comparisons  (for the primary and key secondary  endpoint s) will be carried out. The first 
will be of once daily dosing vs. placebo and the second will be of  intermittent dosing vs. 
placebo.  These two comparisons are not independent of each other and to account for 
multiplicity, a hierarchical procedure will be used (see below) .

overall 5 % significance level  using the Hochberg procedure . If the test is significant for all of 
the key secondary endpoints, then the hierarchical testing will proceed with comparing 
intermittent dosing vs. placebo for the primary , and then the  key secondary , endpoints in the 
same manner as for once daily dosing vs. placebo.    
Full details will be provided in the SAP.  
 
Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data  
Different approaches will be used for handling missing data for different endpoints; each is 
described below  for the primary and key secondary endpoints . The efficacy variables will 
also be analysed using Observed Cases for the PPS.  
 
Adjustment for Covariates  
In all  analyses of ‘ change from baseline’ , the baseline value of the parameter being analysed 
will be included in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  model.  The stratification factor ‘ WLL 
within 2 months prior to the baseline visit ’ will be included in all analysis models.  
 
Multicentre Trial 
Summary statistics will be performed on the whole populations. For baseline demographics 
and disease characteristics , primary endpoint , and key secondary endpoints  summary 
statistics will also be performed by [CONTACT_812944] . Europe vs. US. Centre will not be 
included as a stratification factor in either the randomisation procedure or data analysis. All 
subject  listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_82064].  
 
Examination of Subgroups  
Summary statistics will be presented graphically for the subgroups of subject s having a WLL 
within [ADDRESS_1125760]  data will be 
listed.  
12.1.5  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy variable, (A-a)DO 2, will be te sted using an ANCOVA model . This model 
will have change from baseline to Week 24 in (A-a)DO [ADDRESS_1125761] 
treatment group, WLL within 2 months  prior to randomisation,  and baseline (A -a)DO 2 will be 
predictor variables. The mean difference between each active dose and placebo in change 
from baseline of (A -a)DO 2 will be estimated, along with its  95% confidence interval (CI) and 
associated statistical significance test.  
Subjects who withdraw from their randomised treatment before week 24 should still be 
followed up through to week 24.  For such patients, their week 24 data will be considered as 
primary, irrespective of treatment discontinuation, treatment interruption(s),  use of rescue

be reviewed in the blind review of the SAP, once the extent and pattern of missing data are 
known.  
A sensitivity analysis will include a mixed m odel for repeated measures including factors for 
treatment, visit, treatment- by-visit interaction, and baseline ( A-a)DO 2. 
Subject s who withdraw from the study early and who do not have week [ADDRESS_1125763] their ( A-a)DO 2 measurement imputed usi ng multiple imputation for which full details will 
be given in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Further sensitivity analyses will include:  
• “reasonably worst case”  scenario.   For the primary analysis, patients in either of the 
active arms will have the value of the 10th percentile from their dose arm imputed (i.e. 
approximately the 3rd worst case)  whilst patients in the placebo arm will have the 
median for the placebo arm imputed.  
• Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275] : Patients in any group with a missing endpoint  will be as signed 
progressively worse ( A-a)DO 2 to find the point at which the results reverse from 
favouring the active treatment to the placebo.  
All attempts will be made to retain subjects in the trial, even if they wish to withdraw from trial 
treatment. Hence it is anticipated that there will be only minimal missing ( A-a)DO 2 data at 
week 24 and a further sensitivity analysis will use all available Week 24 data with no 
imputation (i.e. a “completers” analysis).  
12.1.6  Key Secondary Efficacy Analyse s  
Absolute change from baseline in 6MWD  and in SGRQ will be analysed using the same 
ANCOVA model as for (A -a)DO 2.  Imputation for missing data will also follow the same rules 
as for (A -a)DO 2. 
Time to WLL (time from randomisation to documentation that WLL needs to be carried out)  
will be analysed by [CONTACT_659083]. The proportion of subjects in each group who require 
WLL at, or before, week 24 will be estimated, along with a 95% CI for the difference in rates  
between each act ive dose and placebo . Subjects who fulfil the criteria for rescue treatment 
but refuse (or for some other reason do not get) WLL, will be counted as if WLL was 
conducted. This decision will be documented when the trial is complete in the blind review of 
the SAP.  
In addition, the hazard ratio and its 95% confi dence interval will be estimated from a Cox 
model with covariates treatment, geographic region, and need for WLL within [ADDRESS_1125764] not needed a WLL will be considered 
censored at week 24.  
Further rules for handling missing data will be confirmed at the blind review of the SAP. 
Assuming that any subjects who withdraw from treatment remain in the trial, the Week 24 
data will be considered as primary, regardless of adherence to t reatment.

For laboratory values which are below the limit of quantification, the value corresponding to 
the limit of quantif ication will be used when summarising data (e.g. if the result is <0.5 then 
the value 0.5 will be used in the statistical  analysis).

The sample size calculation was based on data in an earlier trial  [19], where the mean  (and 
standard deviation)  (A-a)DO 2 were  31.3 (7 .4) before treatment and 12.9 (7.6)  after treatment  
(all measured in mmHg) . It was  also based on previous assumptions about how the trial 
would be analysed (notably, to combine the tw o active doses together for the primary 
analysis). The minimum clinically relevant difference to detect between active and placebo 
arms is considered to be 10- [ADDRESS_1125772] of mean difference between the two active arms (combined) vs. 
placebo, using a significance level of 0.01 and a power of 90%.  
The trial will test the null hypothesis  
H0: μdiff = 0 
Versus the alternative hypothesis  
H1: μdiff ≠ 0. 
 
The calculation was based on an unpaired t-test, combining the two active dose groups 
together and comparing to placebo . Calculations were made using nQuery Advisor® 7.0.

endpoints, the sample size is increased to 90 subjects (30 patients in each treatment arm), to 
increase the power to identify statistically significant treatment effects also on one or more of 
the key secondary endpoints.  
Very limited data on these secondary endpoints are available but with a sample siz e of [ADDRESS_1125778] of 50 m on the 6MWD 
(assuming a SD of 50) or of 10 points on the SGRQ (assuming a SD of 10) with 
approximately 90 % power.   
Because of the limited data available, a fully blinded s ample size re- estimation procedure will 
be carried out to assess the standard deviations of the 6MWD and the SGRQ, and the 
overall event rate of WLL. This will be done in January [ADDRESS_1125779] reached 24 weeks of treatment.  
The change from baseline to week 24 in 6MWD [and SGRQ] will be summarised in an 
ANCOVA model including WLL (stratification), and baseline 6MWD [SGRQ].  For the 
purposes of the sample size re- estimation process, only data on patients who have baseline 
and w eek 24 data will be used and no imputation will be made for missing values.  
Additionally, the overall (pooled) event rate for WLL will be determined including any patients 
who meet the criteria for WLL any time prior to week 24, but excluding any patients 
who withdraw  prior to week 24 where WLL has not been required.  
 
Based on a literature review of different pulmonary indications but with main focus on 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis carried out in November 2017 [38, 39, 40], the minimal 
clinically important effect sizes for  6MWD and SGRQ  in aPAP are considered to be in the 
order of 40- 50 m and 7 -10 points,  respectively.  From each ANCOVA model, the respective 
residual variance for 6MWD [and SGRQ] will be used to calculate sample size based on the 
effect sizes  of 50 m and 10 points, respectively .  Similarly, the sample size for comparing 
WLL rates of 5% (active) versus 20% (placebo) at 24 weeks will be checked, based on the 
observed (pooled) WLL rate. All calculations will be made based on a 2- sided 5% 
significance level, and 80% and 90% power.  
 
If the maximum of these sample size calculations comes to no more than 33 patients per 
group, then no change to the targ et sample size will be made.  Otherwise, the sample size 
will be increased to attain 90% power for at least [ADDRESS_1125780] 
to the total study size not exceeding 150 patients.

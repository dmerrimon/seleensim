  SYNOPSIS 
Protocol Title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Sham-controlled, 
Comparative Study of SI-6603 in Subjects with Lumbar Disc 
Herniation (Phase 3)  
Protocol Number: 6603/[ADDRESS_388572]: SI-6603 
Study Phase: Phase 3 
Objectives  
Primary Objective: The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 
single-dose intervertebral disc injection of SI-6603 at a dose of 
1.25 units (U) compared to control in subjects with lumbar disc 
herniation (LDH) by [CONTACT_315712] 24 hours, as assessed by [CONTACT_116098] 
(VAS), from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_388573]. 
Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of SI-6603 
1.25 U for key secondary endpoints, and to demonstrate whether 
SI-6603 1.25 U is safe and well tolerated. 
Overall Study Design  
Study Design: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-
controlled, comparative study. The study duration for each 
subject will be approximately 56 weeks: a 4-week screening 
period, a 1-day treatment administration day, and a 52-week 
follow-up period.  
Dosage/Dose Regimen: Subjects randomized to the SI-6603 treatment group will 
receive a single-dose injection of SI-6603 1.25 U into an 
intervertebral disc. Subjects randomized to the control group 
will receive a sham injection (the needle will not be placed in 
the disc). 
Duration of Treatment: Single injection 
Planned Number of 
Subjects:  It is planned to enroll approximately 320 subjects, 160 in the SI-
6603 group and 160 in the control group.

Study Population 
Summary:  The study population will consist of male and female subjects, 
30 to 70 years of age (inclusive) at the time of informed 
consent, with single-level LDH (L4-L5 or L5-S1 (or L5-L6)) 
with clear, demonstrable nerve root impi[INVESTIGATOR_315668] (MRI) and clinical symptoms 
corresponding to position of the impaired nerve root. 
Criteria for Evaluation  
Efficacy Assessments:  Primary: 
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_388574] 24 hours over the 
previous 7 days, as assessed by 100 mm VAS. 
Key Secondary: 
The key secondary endpoints include the following: 
1) Change from baseline to Week 13 in herniation volume 
2) Change from baseline to Week 13 in Oswestry Disability 
Index (ODI) score  
3) Change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_388575] 24 hours over the previous 7 
days, as assessed by 100 mm VAS.  
Secondary: 
Additional secondary endpoints are described in the full 
protocol. 
Safety Assessments: The following safety endpoints will be assessed after 
investigational product administration: 
 Adverse events  
 Laboratory tests 
 Vital signs 
 Imaging assessment by X-ray and MRI 
- Disc height (disc index) 
- Vertebral body translation 
- Vertebral body angle formed by [CONTACT_315713]  6603/1133  Sponsor: Seikagaku Corporation 
Clinical Study Protocol:

Version 7.0 
  - Modic classification 
 Occurrence of post-treatment lumbar surgery 
- Surgery for treatment of LDH at a different 
level than administration of the investigational 
product 
- Lumbar surgery not for treatment of LDH  
Statistical Methods: The change from baseline in the worst leg pain scores will be 
analyzed by a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis for Week 1 through Week 52 in the modified intention-
to-treat (mITT) population. The average worst leg pain scores 
over the previous [ADDRESS_388576] leg pain score, treatment, time, 
treatment-by- time interaction, and duration of leg pain as fixed 
effects. An unstructured covariance will be used to model the 
covariance structure among repeated measures. Should the model 
fail to converge with the type = UN option, a compound 
symmetry structure will be used. Kenward- Roger method will be 
used for computing the denominator degrees of freedom. The 
missing data will be implicitly handled via a mixed-effect model, 
without explicit imputation. 
Statistical met hods for key secondary endpoints and adjustment 
for multiplicity are described in the full protocol.

  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) occurs as a result of a protrusion or prolapse of the nucleus 
pulposus of an intervertebral disc into the spi[INVESTIGATOR_315669]. The nucleus pulposus 
compresses the spi[INVESTIGATOR_315670], causing symptoms including leg pain, low back pain, 
and numbness.(1) The principal treatment for LDH is conservative, resulting in a response in 
approximately 90% of patients.(2, 3) Conservative treatment includes rest, bed rest, medication 
(e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], steroids, and muscle relaxants), corset, 
traction therapy, thermotherapy, epi[INVESTIGATOR_71545], nerve root block, and physical therapy. 
Surgical treatment is an option for approximately 20% to 50% of the patients who do not 
respond to conservative treatment.(4, 5) To minimize the invasiveness of surgical procedures, 
new treatment approaches have become available, including chemonucleolysis, percutaneous 
nucleotomy, percutaneous laser disc decompression, and microendoscopic discectomy. 
Chemonucleolysis alleviates the symptoms of LDH using an enzyme, which is injected into 
the relevant intervertebral disc to reduce nerve root compression through lysis of the nucleus 
pulposus and reduction of disc pressure.(1) Chemonucleolysis is a valuable treatment for 
patients who do not respond to other conservative treatments, those with severe disorders, 
and those who are candidates for surgery, and it is currently positioned as a minimally 
invasive option after conservative treatment has failed and as an alternative to invasive 
surgery.(6, 7) Although chymodiactin (chymopapain) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) as a 
drug for chemonucleolysis, the neurological adverse events (AEs) due to its protease activity 
have been problematic.(1, 8) Therefore, development of drugs that are highly specific to the 
nucleus pulposus alone and that do not influence nerve tissue surrounding the disc is needed 
for safe and effective chemonucleolysis. 
Condoliase is a glycosaminoglycan-decomposing enzyme isolated and purified from a gram-
negative rod, Proteus vulgaris .(9) In LDH, Condoliase is thought to decompose 
glycosaminoglycan chains, thereby [CONTACT_315714][INVESTIGATOR_315671]. In addition, Condoliase has the potential advantage of minimizing AEs, such as 
nerve tissue injuries in the area surrounding intervertebral discs, due to its substrate 
specificity(10) and lack of protease activity when compared with chymopapain. Seikagaku 
Corporation (SKK) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_315672]-6603, a lyophilized injectable drug containing 
Condoliase as the active ingredient for treating LDH. The phase 1/2 study (Study Number: 
SKK6603J01), phase 2/3 study (Study Number: 6603/1021), and phase 3 study (Study 
Number: 6603/1031) and a follow-up study after completion of the phase 2/3 and phase 3

  studies (Study Number: 6603/10R2) have been completed in Japan, and a phase 2 study 
(Study Number: 6603/1121) and a phase 3 double blind study (Study Number: 6603/1131) 
have been completed in the US, and also a phase 3 open label study (Study Number: 
6603/1132) has been completed in the US and EU.  
1.1.1 Summary of Clinically Significant Findings Obtained in Nonclinical Studies and 
Clinical Studies 
A summary of nonclinical studies and prior clinical studies of SI-6603 can be found in 
Section 1 in the current edition of the investigator's brochure (IB), which contains 
comprehensive information about SI-6603. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_388585] administration. 
1.2 Risk and Benefit 
1.2.1 Possible Risks 
[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic Reactions 
SI-[ADDRESS_388586]-marketing use of SI-6603. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Back Pain 
The most frequently reported treatment-related AE in previous studies was back pain. 
Occurrence of back pain is likely to be influenced by [CONTACT_315715] ; however, back pain 
occurring soon after administration of SI-6603 may be attributable to nucleus pulposus 
degradation. There are 2 potential mechanisms for this: 1) an increase in intervertebral disc 
pressure immediately after injection of SI-6603, and 2) pain associated with changes in disc 
height leading to pain from associated vertebral end plates and facet joints.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Decrease of Lumbar Disc Height and Change in Bone Marrow Adjacent to 
Vertebral Endplates 
In past studies with SI-6603 administration, treatment-related AEs of nuclear magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) abnormal (change in bone marrow adjacent to vertebral endplates; 
Modic change), spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] X-ray abnormal (such as intervertebral posterior angle dilation), and 
30% decrease of disc height were observed. The clinical significance of Modic changes 
remains unclear, and past SI-6603 studies did not reveal any increase in leg pain or back pain 
in conjunction with Modic changes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiation 
Risks associated with radiological imaging are well quantified.(11) The effective radiation 
dose from each radiograph performed in this study is as follows: 
During screening or follow-up visits: 
 lateral lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: 0.290 millisievert (mSv) 
 anteroposterior lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: 0.690 mSv 
The total radiation dose for each screening or follow-up visit is 1.560 mSv, for a total of 
4.7 mSv for 3 of these visits during the study. 
During the injection procedure: 
 1.25 mSv (varies depending on procedure of each site) 
X-ray imaging and the use of fluoroscopy may cause burns ranging in severity from skin 
reddening to ulcers, loss of hair in the procedural area, and delayed development of 
neoplasia. The overall radiation dose for this study is within the reasonable amount, so the 
risks associated with study-related radiation for this study are acceptable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Intradiscal Injection 
Temporary discomfort, injection site pain, bleeding, vascular damage, bruising, vagal 
reaction, nerve damage, disc damage, and/or infection at the injection site may occur due to 
the injection procedure. These events may also occur for the sham injection procedure even if 
the needle is not be inserted into the disc space and no placebo is injected. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_315673] a risk that subjects who are prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_315674]-provided opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], which could lead to cravings for or seeking opi[INVESTIGATOR_315675]. The study minimizes this risk in several ways. First, only subjects

  who were previously on opi[INVESTIGATOR_315676]/acetaminophen as a rescue 
medication. Second, the subject will be limited to [ADDRESS_388587] that a single administration of 1.0 mL of the 1.25 U/mL, 2.5 U/mL, or 5.0 U/mL 
formulations of SI-6603 injected into the intervertebral disc relieved leg pain, the major 
complaint of patients with LDH. In the Japanese phase 2/3 and phase 3 studies, 
administration of SI-6603 1.25 U/mL demonstrated clinically significant improvement of leg 
pain and favorable improvement of back pain in LDH patients with contained-type hernia 
(unruptured posterior longitudinal ligament) who failed to improve after undergoing 
conservative treatment for a period of more than 6 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Improvement of LDH Symptoms 
In the Japanese Phase [ADDRESS_388588] 
Squares (LS) mean change from baseline in worst leg pain at Week 13 in the 1.25 U dose 
group compared with the placebo group (-49.5 mm in 1.25 U group and -34.3 mm in placebo 
group on a 100 mm visual analogue scale [VAS]). This finding demonstrated the superiority 
of SI-[ADDRESS_388589] 
leg pain in the treatment groups also continued beyond Week 13 ; at the final observation at 
Week 52, the values were 30.[ADDRESS_388590] low back pain at Week 52 was -34.0 mm in 1.25 U dose group and -24.5 
mm in placebo group. This difference between treatment groups was not statistically 
significant, but a similar study by [CONTACT_315716]. assessing the VAS scores of 108 lumbar 
discectomy patients showed that low back pain improved from 4.6 cm before surgery to 
2.1 cm at 6 weeks after surgery, which means the change from baseline was -25.0 mm.(12) 
These results indicated that the observed improvement in low back pain with SI-6603 
injection would be considered clinically beneficial.

  1.2.3 Rationale for Study Design, Administration Route, Dosage (Regimen), and 
Treatment Period Selection 
The result of the Japanese phase [ADDRESS_388591] a 
clinical study intended to evaluate the efficacy of SI-6603 1.25 U compared with control for 
the treatment of LDH. The intradiscal route was selected as the route of SI-6603 
administration for this study. The dose selected for this study is 1.25 U administered as a 
single injection into the intervertebral disc as a result of the Japanese phase 2/[ADDRESS_388592] with a single dose administration.  
LDH is treated primarily with conservative non-operative therapy ; in patients who fail to 
respond to this therapy, surgery remains one of the only remaining options. Thus, the target 
population of the current study is patients who have failed conservative therapy and who have 
not received surgery.

Subjects will be allowed to participate in this study only if they meet all of the following 
criteria: 
1. Subjects who have given their written informed consent to participate in the clinical study 
based on voluntary agreement after a thorough explanation of subject participation is 
provided to them. Subjects should be willing and able to provide written informed 
consent, adhere to the study visit schedule, and answer the questions on subject-
completed assessments. 
2. Male or female subjects 30 to 70 years of age, inclusive, at the time of informed consent.

corresponding to the ipsilateral leg and distribution of the affected nerve root; and 
c. positive result of Straight Leg Raise (SLR) test (≤70°) on the ipsilateral leg 
corresponding to the pain and distribution of the affected nerve root. The SLR 
should be performed with the subject lying flat on his/her back, and the angle 
measured relative to the horizontal plane of the examining table. 
*Judged first by [CONTACT_093], then confirmed by [CONTACT_315718]. 
**Defined as a condition characterized by [CONTACT_315719] L5 or S1 dermatomes, which may be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_315720], sensory loss, and/or (for S1 compression) 
decreased or absent ankle (Achilles) reflex. 
4. Subjects with a current epi[INVESTIGATOR_315677]:

neurological examination, pain assessment, imaging assessment). These procedures and 
assessments can be set based on the investigator’s decision. During the pre-screening period, 
the investigator or delegated site staff can collect X-ray and MR images and transmit them to 
the central imaging facility according to a separate procedural manual. MRI and X-ray 
images are not required to be repeated as long as these images were previously acquired

  6.6 Concomitant Medications 
6.6.1 Prohibited Medications 
Use of the following medications are prohibited after wash-out. Prohibited concomitant 
medications include the following: 
[Prohibited in any forms] 
 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (including tramadol, tapentadol, meperidine, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-containing 
combination products) except as described in rescue medication Section 6.6.4) 
 Cannabis (even where legal) 
Note: Use of CBD oil that contains regulated quantities of tetrahydrocannabinol 
(i.e., psychoactive CBD oil preparations) is prohibited; amounts of THC 
resulting in a positive drug test will be disqualifying.  
[Prohibited in specific forms] 
 Oral and injectable corticosteroids to the back, buttock, or posterior/lateral aspects of 
the affected leg. 
Note: Inhaled, nasal, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_315683] (e.g., < 100 
cm2) is permitted. 
 Local anesthesia to the back, buttock, or posterior/lateral aspects of the affected leg.  
Note: Local anesthesia to the back during the investigational product injection 
procedure is permitted. 
Subjects should also suspend the use of over-the-counter medications that may contain any 
active ingredient(s) described above.  
For further details, see medication listings that will be separately distributed. 
6.6.[ADDRESS_388622] 7 days prior to randomization may be enrolled in the study. These 
restricted concomitant medications include NSAIDs, acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, 
medicines for neuropathic pain (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin), and medicines for depression 
used to treat LDH. Medications stated as restricted concomitant medications for purpose of 
use other than to treat LDH should also remain in stable dose.  
Throughout the follow-up period, subjects are allowed to reduce the amount of their restricted 
medication drug after injection by [CONTACT_315737], but they must not add a 
medication or increase a dose once it is decreased.

Version 7.0 
  All restricted concomitant medications used on an as-needed basis (except for rescue 
medications) are prohibited. 
For further details, see medication listings that will be separately distributed. 
6.6.3 Medication Use Before, After or During the Injection Procedure 
If subjects are required to stop use of any restricted concomitant medications temporarily 
prior to injection, such restricted concomitant medication can be resumed with same 
dose/dosage after the injection. However, such subjects can only stop medication within 2 
days prior to date of randomization.  
Conscious sedation with non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_315695]/or imaging procedure when necessary for subject comfort or safety. Use of prohibited 
medication (e.g. inhalational anesthetics, opi[INVESTIGATOR_315696]) before, 
after or during the injection procedure is not allowed. Use of rescue medication 2 
(hydrocodone/acetaminophen) after the injection procedure is allowed. 
For the purpose of managing post-injection pain and if the use of rescue medication 1 
(acetaminophen) is not sufficient for pain control, it is permissible to add or increase the dose 
of an NSAID for pain or a muscle relaxant for muscle spasm during the 3-day post-injection 
period. 
6.6.4 Rescue Medications 
[Acetaminophen (rescue medication 1)] 
Subjects will be provided with acetaminophen at each clinic visit to use as a rescue 
medication 1 for breakthrough pain resulting from LDH or for treatment of AEs. Subjects 
will be instructed to use the acetaminophen only if the pain has sufficient severity to require 
use of the rescue medication.  
Subjects will be advised to limit their total acetaminophen use to 3,000 mg/day. Subjects will 
also be reminded not to use other medications that contain acetaminophen, such as cold or 
allergy medications, as this may cause them to consume more than 3,000 mg of 
acetaminophen in 1 day. 
Subjects will also be asked to bring the acetaminophen container(s) with any remaining 
tablets every visit. If a subject has enough remaining acetaminophen, additional medication 
will not be provided.

Version 7.0 
  [Hydrocodone/acetaminophen (rescue medication 2): limited to opi[INVESTIGATOR_315697]] 
Hydrocodone/acetaminophen will be prescribed as rescue medication 2 only for subjects who 
are using prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_315698] (or documented within the past 2 
months).  Further, in order to participate, these subjects must be willing to wash-out of their 
current opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] (See Section 4.2) and, when not already prescribed 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen, switch to hydrocodone/acetaminophen for the duration of the 
study. These subjects may be prescribed up to 60 hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5mg/300-
325mg) tablets to use as a rescue medication 2 through the end of the study. 
Subjects will be instructed that the hydrocodone/acetaminophen should be used on a limited 
basis and only when acetaminophen alone fails to adequately relieve pain. Further they will 
be instructed that they should wait at least 4 hours after using acetaminophen before they 
dose with hydrocodone/acetaminophen.  
Subjects will be allowed to take hydrocodone/acetaminophen at 1 - 2 tablets every 4 to 6 
hours as needed for severe pain, but not to exceed 4 tablets per day. Subjects will be advised 
to limit their total acetaminophen use to 3,000 mg/day. As such, subjects will be reminded 
not to use other medications that contain acetaminophen, such as cold or allergy medications, 
as this may cause them to consume more than 3,000 mg of acetaminophen in 1 day. 
During each of the consecutive 7 days prior to Visit 6 (Week 6), Visit 7 (Week 13), Visit 8 
(Week 26), Visit 9 (Week 39), and Visit 10 (Week 52), the use of 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen is prohibited. For Visit 7 (Week 13) and Visit 10 (Week 52), 
subjects will be instructed to suspend use of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10 days prior to 
those visits. As noted in the exclusion criteria, no opi[INVESTIGATOR_315699] 
7 days prior to Visit 2 (Week 1) (See Section 4.2). 
Hydrocodone/acetaminophen will be prescribed at a maximum of 28 tablets per prescription 
and not to exceed total of 60 tablets during the study. Subjects will also be asked to bring the 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen container(s) with any remaining tablets to every visit. If a 
subject has enough remaining hydrocodone/acetaminophen to last until the next scheduled 
visit, additional medication will not be provided.

For this study, the following imaging findings will be recorded as AEs: 
 Disc height (disc index): decrease in disc height ≥30% compared to baseline value 
 Vertebral posterior angle: vertebral body angle formed by [CONTACT_315742] ≥5° 
 Vertebral body translation: vertebral body translation of ≥3 mm 
 Changes of vertebral body endplates and adjacent bone marrow as visible by [CONTACT_9268].

endplates and adjacent bone marrow. 
Note: The above events are limited to the targeted level of the procedure and the adjacent 
vertebral bodies. 
All AEs, including concurrent illnesses, occurring during the study will be documented in the

   Mild:  No particular interference with the subject’s activities of daily living or, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_315709], no particular intervention indicated (Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 1) 
 Moderate:  Interference with the subject’s activities of daily living and minimal 
intervention indicated (CTCAE Grade 2) 
 Severe:  Disabling and almost complete interference with the subject’s activities of 
daily living or systemic intervention indicated (CTCAE Grade 3/4) 
10.2.2 Causality 
The investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the investigational product and 
the AE and record the assessment in the eCRF. Causality will be recorded as related or not 
related. 
The most likely cause of an SAE (e.g., disease under treatment, concomitant disease, 
concomitant medication, other) will be indicated in the eCRF with details of the concomitant 
disease or medication or other cause. 
The causal relationship of the AE to investigational product will be described as: 
 Not related:  No temporal correlation or attributability to any other factor, such as 
the underlying disease, a complication, a concomitant drug, a predisposition, or 
concomitant intervention, can be explicitly explained. 
 Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the relevant event can be judged to be 
due to the investigational product or a causal relationship cannot be ruled out. 
10.[ADDRESS_388658] report any SAEs within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 
Reporting guidance will be provided separately.

  The investigator and the sponsor or designee will review each SAE report and the sponsor or 
designee will evaluate the seriousness and the causal relationship of the event to study 
treatment. In addition, the sponsor or designee will evaluate the expectedness according to 
the reference document. Based on the investigator’s and sponsor’s assessment of the event, a 
decision will be made concerning the need for further action. 
Serious adverse events occurring after the end of the study and coming to the attention of the 
investigator must be reported only if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], they are considered 
causally related to the investigational product.

recovered/Not resolved, Recovered/Resolved with sequelae, Recovering/Resolving, Fatal, 
Unknown) should also be recorded. 
10.6 Action Taken for Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events will be recorded on the AE and SAE eCRFs. Sponsor or designee will 
provide safety reports to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and investigators in 
accordance with the regulations detailed in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32. 
11 STATISICAL METHODS 
The planned statistical analysis will be described in detail in a separately prepared statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). 
11.1 Analysis Populations 
The efficacy analyses will be performed on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) 
population. Efficacy analyses of the per-protocol (PP) population will be supportive of the 
mITT analysis. The safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. 
11.2 Modified Intention-to-Treat Population 
The mITT population is defined as all randomized subjects who received the study injection, 
analyzed according to the assigned treatment.

Confidential Page [ADDRESS_388660] leg pain scores will be analyzed by a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) analysis for Week [ADDRESS_388661] leg pain scores over the previous 7 days will be analyzed at Week 1, 2, 4, 
6, 13, 26, 39, 52 (See Section 11.8.1 for additional details). The primary comparison will be 
the mean change from baseline of the SI-[ADDRESS_388662] leg pain score, 
treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, and duration of leg pain as fixed effects. An 
unstructured covariance will be used to model the covariance structure among repeated 
measures. Should the model fail to converge with the type = UN option, a compound 
symmetry structure will be used. Kenward-Roger method will be used for computing the 
denominator degrees of freedom. The missing data will be implicitly handled via a mixed-
effect model, without explicit imputation.

the primary. 
11.6.3 Other Secondary 
All endpoints, including the primary and key secondary endpoints, will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_81589]. The differences of other secondary endpoints between the 
SI-6603 and control groups will be analyzed at each time point as below. In addition, weekly 
pain intensity scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
 A similar longitudinal analysis model will be used as described in the primary 
efficacy analysis for the analysis of change from baseline in pain intensity scores, 
function scores, QOL scores, and volumes, by [CONTACT_315754]. 
 Neurologic status as determined by [CONTACT_315755] a 
logistic regression model. Baseline neurologic status and duration of leg pain will be 
included as covariates. 
 For the global assessments of PGIC score and CGIC score, responder analysis with 
the two best categories as “responder” will be analyzed with a logistic regression 
model. Baseline worst leg pain score and duration of leg pain will be included as 
covariates. 
 Scores on the WPAI will be analyzed with the analysis of covariance model including 
the baseline value and duration of leg pain as covariates. 
 The incidence of rescue medication use will be analyzed with Fisher’s exact test, and 
the amount of rescue medication use and usage of concomitant medications for LDH 
will be analyzed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
 Cumulative distribution of percentage change from baseline in worst leg pain and 
ODI will be generated, and differences between the SI-6603 and control groups in the 
percentages of subjects experiencing a >30% and >50% improvement in worst leg 
pain score will be analyzed with Fisher’s exact test. 
 For the analysis of the percentages of responders by [CONTACT_315739], differences 
between the SI-[ADDRESS_388664] leg pain score and 
duration of leg pain will be included as covariates. 
 Time to post-treatment surgery for LDH will be evaluated by [CONTACT_315756]-rank test.

Confidential Page [ADDRESS_388665] 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated by [CONTACT_315757], serious TEAEs, significant TEAEs, and Treatment-emergent Adverse 
Events of Special Interest (TEAESI). The incidences of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, significant 
TEAEs, and TEAESI will be tabulated according to system organ class and preferred term by 
[CONTACT_1570]. The incidences of TEAEs and TEAESI will be tabulated by [CONTACT_315758]. Treatment-related TEAEs will 
also be summarized separately. 
If a subject has more than 1 occurrence of the same AE, he/she will be counted only once 
within that preferred term in the summary tables. The most severe occurrence of an AE, as 
well as the most extreme relationship of the AE to the study procedures and investigational 
product, will be indicated in cases of multiple occurrences of the same AE. 
Vital signs, laboratory assessments, imaging findings, and occurrence of post-treatment 
lumbar surgery will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. In addition, association between 
imaging findings and clinical symptoms will be assessed. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_388666] leg pain score from 7 consecutive days prior to each visit (the day of the visit 
will not be included) will be used as the worst leg pain score for each time point, after 
excluding the worst leg pain score on any of the following days: 
 Days after prohibited concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_315710], lumbar percutaneous 
nucleotomy, or lumbar intradiscal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_315711], and 
 Days before the previous visit (for example, the Week [ADDRESS_388667] 5 days after 
Week 1; thus, the days prior to the Week 1 visit will not be considered as eligible for 
inclusion in the 7-day Week 2 average). 
In addition, if less than [ADDRESS_388668] leg pain score will be handled as missing at the time point. 
For the separate analysis of the weekly pain scores throughout the study, an average of the 
scores every 7 days will be calculated regardless of the visit date.

displayed according to the eCRF assessment recorded by [CONTACT_093]. Unscheduled 
assessments (laboratory data or vital signs associated with non-protocol clinical visits or 
obtained in investigating or managing AEs) will be included in listings but not summaries of 
the data.  
11.8.3 Significance Level and Confidence Coefficient 
A two-sided 5% significance level for any hypothesis testing will be used, and the 
methodology for the adjustment of multiplicity is described in Section 11.8.5. A two-sided 
95% confidence coefficient will be used for interval estimation unless otherwise specified. 
11.8.[ADDRESS_388669] missing efficacy data will be classified as non-responders.  
No replacement of any missing data will be made for the safety analyses. 
11.8.5 Adjustment for Multiplicity 
To control family-wise error rate for multiple tests of the primary and key secondary 
endpoints, the following Holm-based testing algorithm will be used. 
 The treatment effect on the primary endpoint will be evaluated at α = 0.05.  
 If the effect on the primary endpoint is significant, the treatment effect on the key 
secondary endpoints of herniation volume at Week [ADDRESS_388670] at α = 0.05. The truncation 
parameter will be set to 0.8.(14)

12 ETHICAL CONSIDERATION 
12.1 Good Clinical Practice Compliance 
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure that the sponsor, 
investigators, and other study participants abide by [CONTACT_315759] (GCP) guidelines of the International Conference for Harmonisation (ICH). The 
study also will be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_95829].  
12.[ADDRESS_388673] or Independent Ethics Committee Approval 
If a significant safety issue is identified, either from an individual case report or review of 
aggregate data, then the sponsor will issue prompt notification to all parties, including 
regulatory authorities, investigators, and IRB(s). A significant safety issue is one that has a 
significant impact on the course of the clinical study or program (including the potential for

  suspension of the development program or amendments to protocols) or warrants an 
immediate update of the ICF. 
12.3 Data Protection 
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The investigator and 
members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written 
approval from the sponsor. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be identified on 
the eCRF and other documents submitted by [CONTACT_139927], initials, and/or birth date, 
not by [CONTACT_2300]. Documents not to be submitted that identify the subject (e.g., the signed ICF) 
must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_093]. 
12.[ADDRESS_388674] to subjects if the study continues, the study may be 
terminated after appropriate consultation between the relevant parties. The study may also be 
terminated early at the Sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a finding. 
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected (e.g. AE other than AEs listed in Table 6.1. in the current 
edition of the investigator brochure), significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects 
enrolled in the study 
• The occurrence of an AE considered at least possibly related to SI-6603, as noted below: 
a. Significant neurologic deficit; for example, progressive weakness or sudden loss 
of muscle strength, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or other signs and symptoms of 
cauda equine / conus medullaris invol vement; 
b. Abnormal X-ray findings of instability, defined as vertebral body angle formed by 
[CONTACT_315742] ≥5° or vertebral body translation of ≥3 mm; or 
c. Abnormal X-ray or MRI findings which subjects exhibit correlating clinical 
symptoms posing safety concerns, leads the investigator to judge it necessary for 
the subject to have surgical intervention 
• Failure to enroll subjects at an acceptable rate 
• A decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the drug

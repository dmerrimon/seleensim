Title of Study:  
  
A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Confirmatory Phase 2 Study Assessing 
the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Bryostatin in the Treatment of Moderately Severe to 
Severe Alzheimer’s Disease  Subjects Not Receiving Memantine Treatment  
Study c enter(s):  Approximately 30 sites in [LOCATION_002] (US)  
 
Protocol Number:  NTRP -101-203 
 
Study Duration:  Approximately 1 2 months  Study Phase: 2 
 
Objective:   
 
Primary objective:  
To evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy  of bryostatin  1 (hereafter referred to as 
bryostati n) for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  
 
Study Drug :   Bryostatin 1 or matching Placebo  
Route of Administration: Intravenous by [CONTACT_229230] 45±5 minutes  
Number of Subjects : 100 randomized subjects (approximately 145 subjects screened)  
Study Design  
This is a randomized double -blind Placebo -controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin  to 
placebo for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer’s disease in subjects not 
receiving memantine treatment. The study is [ADDRESS_386801] s will receive 7 doses of 
study drug during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the change from 
baseline to Week 13 in the Severe Impairment Battery ( SIB) total score .  
 
Randomization and Treatment  
Eligible subjects will be stratified ba sed on Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE -2) scores 4 -9 
vs. 10 -15 and will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms: 20µg bryostatin or 
placebo for twelve weeks. The first two doses of study drug  will be a loading dose 20% 
higher  (i.e., 24µg ) than the assi gned dose  and will be administered one week apart.

administered every other week.  Drug is administered IV by [CONTACT_229230] 45(±5) 
minutes . Subjects are scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks.  
 
Evaluation  Methods  
Safety and tolerability will be determined through evaluations of adverse events (AE), 
serious adverse events (SAE), physical examination (PE), vital signs, 12 -lead 
electroc ardiogram (ECG), the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS), and 
clinical laboratory assessments.  
 
Cognitive improvements wil l be evaluated primarily with the Severe Impairment Battery 
(SIB) and secondarily with functional improvements in the Alzh eimer’s Disease Cooperative 
Study – Activities of Daily Living - Severe Impairment Version ( ADCL -ADL -Sev), Clinical 
Global Impression of Improvement (CGI -I), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) metrics.  
 
Safety Assessments  
 
• Treatment emergent AEs and SAEs  
• Vital signs, hematology, blood chemistry, physical examination  including body 
weight  
• ECG parameters  
• C-SSRS  
 
Primary Efficacy End point 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the change from baseline to Week 13 in the SIB 
total score .  
Secondary Efficacy End points   
•  The changes from baseline  at Weeks 5 , 9 and 15  in the SIB total score   
• The changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9, 13 and 15 in the SIB total score for subjects 
in the MMSE -2 4-9 stratification group  
• The changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9 , 13 and 15 in the SIB total score for subjects 
in the MMSE -2 10-15 stratification group  
• Individual patient’s s lope over time in SI B total score evaluated  via Week s 0, 5, 9, 
and 13

score  
• Change from baseline i n 10-point Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score  
• Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI -I) score  
 
Statistical Considerations:  
 
The primary objective for efficacy is to evaluate whether bryostatin is better than the control 
with respect to the primary and secondary SIB endpoints.  
 
Efficacy analyses will be conducted for the full analysis set (FAS), consistent with the 
modified inte ntion -to-treat principle, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of randomized study medication and who had at least one post -baseline assessment. 
The completer analysis set (CAS) will be defined as all randomized subjects who co mpleted 
[ADDRESS_386803] a week 13 SIB assessment.  
 
Adverse event and other safety data will be analyzed descriptively in all subjects who 
received any dose of study drug (including partial infusions).  These data will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_314365].

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 19 of 74 1 INTRODUCTION   
1.0 Alzheimer’s  disease  
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 5.3 million 
people in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and 30 million people worldwide.   There is a disproportionate 
representation of women with nearly 2/3 of the affected individuals being female.  Of the 5.3 
million affected Americans , 5.1 million  are older than 65  (Alzheimer’s Association website 
www.alz.org , 2015 ).  Since aging is the single most important risk factor for development of 
dementia and medical advances are prolonging survival , the incidence of AD w ill increase.  The 
US Census Bureau data suggest that the number of individuals living until age 100 between the 
years 2000 and 2020 will increase by [CONTACT_726] 200% and the number of individuals living until 
age 90-95 will double .4   By 2050 the number of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease will almost 
triple to a projected 13.8 million.  In 2013, 15.5 million family and friends provided 17.7 billion 
hours of unpaid  care to those with Alzheimer’s and other dementias – care valued at $220.2 billion  
(Alzheim er’s Association website  www.alz.org , 2015 ). 
The currently approved treatments for AD provide modest symptomatic benefit and do not alter 
the disease progression.  These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314315] [tacrine 
(Cognex), donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) , and galantamine (galanthamine, Reminyl)] 
and the N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, memantine (Namenda).  The development of a 
medication that produces a signific ant improvement in clinical symptoms and/or slows the 
progression of the disease would be a significant advance in the therapeutics of AD.  
The protein kinase C  (PKC ) signaling pathways have been shown to play an integral role in learning 
and memory. Severa l animal models have demonstrated that PKC is involved in the learning 
process.5, [ADDRESS_386822] shown age -specific changes of PKC 
isozyme distribution in the brain ,8, 9 impaired PKC translocation, reduced levels of the PKC 
anchoring protein, RACK1 ,10 alterations in mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk1/2 ,11 and 
reduced levels of the α -secretase cleaved Amyloid Precursor Protein  (APP), soluble amyloid 
precursor protein alpha (sAPPα), in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) .12  Aging of normal human 
fibrob lasts also reduced secretion of sAPPα.   
The demonstration of reduced levels of PKC in the brain of Alzheimer’s subject s suggests a 
potential target to improve cognition i n AD is the activation of PKC which in turn activates a 
series of downstream pathways  that enhance synaptic function and promote synaptogenesis. 
Bryostatin is a potent stimulator of PKCε and is non -tumorigenic. Hongpaisan et.al [ADDRESS_386823] on synaptogenesis in two strains of 
transgenic  AD mice.  Their work was recently reproduced by [CONTACT_314366] , et.al.14 Activation of PKCε 
by [CONTACT_314367] β amyloid, increased levels  of the Brain 
Derived Neurotropic Factor  (BDNF) , prevention of synapse loss, reduced pla que formation and 
restored memory and learning even in the presence of pla ques.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 20 of 74 1.1 Rationale for the use of bryostatin in the treatment of AD  
The pharmacological basis for the use of bryostatin for the treatment of AD is based on the 
hypothesis that low dose, in termittent administration of bryostatin will activate PKC isozymes α 
and ε. Activation of PKC is associated with:  
• Enhance d associative learning and recent memory via PKC -mediated phosphory lation of 
downstream substrates  
• Increase d synthesis of proteins suc h as MAP kinase Erk1/2, and synaptogenic proteins such 
as BDNF required for long -term memory  
• Activat ion of  α-secretases, thereby [CONTACT_314368] -toxic fragments of the beta -amyloid 
precursor protein (βAPP) and reducing the neurotoxic fragment of βAPP, Aβ 1-42, and t he 
associated neuropathology  
• Activat ion of  Aβ1-42 – degrading  enzymes  
• Phosphorylat ion of  [COMPANY_004] -3 beta, inhibiting production of Tau an d the associated 
neuropathology  
• Improved memory and learning in  3 different strains of transgenic mice with single or 
multiple Alzheimer’s gene mutations even in  the presence of amyloid plaque  14, 13, 15  
 
Thus , activation of PKC can enhance existing synaptic function, reduce the toxic effects of 
amyloid and promo te synaptogenesis , all potential target s to improve cognitive function in AD .  
1.2 Pharmacokinetics , Toxicology and Drug Metabolism in Animals   
Single dose toxicity of bryostatin  has been characterized in four non-GLP studies conducted under 
National Cancer Institute’s (NCI)  IND, including three  IV toxicity studies in mice and one IV 
toxicity study in rats.  Bryostatin was evaluated in a  single  GLP –repeated dose 21 -day IV toxicity 
study in rats.  The  single dose toxicity  studies were conducted using two different dosing 
formu lations: bryostatin in ethanol/saline or bryostatin in polyethylene glycol, ethanol, and Tween 
80 (PET) diluent.  LD 50 range d from a low of 38µg/kg to 75µg/kg.  The 21 -day repeat -dose toxic 
study  performed in rats at doses of 0, 10, 15 and 25µg/m2 with the ethanol/saline formulation  
resulted in  no relevant toxicology findings.  The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and no adverse 
effect level  (NOAEL ) were noted to be 25µg/m2 the highest dose studied.  However , since there 
were no toxicologically relevant findings , the report  suggested that the MTD and NOAEL are 
greater than  25µg/m2. 
Two preliminary dose range finding IV toxicology studies were performed in the rat and dog to 
characterize the toxicity of  bryostatin and to estimate the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) when 
administered by [CONTACT_314369].   In the Sprague -Dawley rat bryostatin 
was tolerated up to 1 0ug/kg (infusion)  and 15ug/kg (bolus)  with no significant differences in 
toxicity noted between the two routes of administration.   In the beagle dog bryostatin was tolerated 
at doses up to 1 5ug/kg (infusion  and bolus).  There were no significant differences in toxicity 
between the two routes of administration.  A more detailed r esults summary can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 21 of 74 Limited pharmacokinetics ( PK) data are available in animals .  The pharmacokinetics of bryostatin  
was analyzed in female CD1/F2 mice by [CONTACT_2329] [C26 -3H]-labeled bryostatin following IV and IP 
administration (Zhang et al 1996).   Following  IV administration of 40µg/kg (120mg/m2), the 
plasma disappearance curve for bryostatin could be described by a [ADDRESS_386824] 12 hours after IV 
administration, with 23.0 ± 1.9% (mean ± standard deviation) of the administered dose excreted. 
Approximately eq ual amounts of radioactivity (40%) were excreted in feces compared with urine 
within 72 hours after IV administration.   A greater area under the curve, longer mean resident time, 
and lower clearance were observed with IP administration compared with IV adm inistration.   
Bryostatin  was widely distributed to various tissues following both IV and IP administration.  
However, accumulation was observed in the lung, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and fatty tissue.  
1.3 Genotoxicity   
Bryostatin  1 was evaluated usin g the bacterial reverse mutat ion assay (i.e., the Ames test)  with no 
positive responses  observed.  Bryostatin  1 was evaluated as negative (nonclastogenic) in the 
micronucleus assay ; it was also evaluated as negative (non -DNA damaging) in the Comet Assay.  
Overall, based on the results of the Ames test and the combined micronucleus/comet assay, 
bryostatin  [ADDRESS_386825] s received bryostatin,  mainly under NCI’s IND # 42,780, 
with exposures to bryostatin in both single and combination agent studies .  About [ADDRESS_386826] s 
received bryostatin as monotherapy, with dose levels ranging from 5 μg/m2 to >1 80μg/m2.  Most 
subject s in both the monotherapy and combination therapy studies received bryostati n at doses 
>25μg/m2, most often as 1-hour infusions administered  at various time intervals from weekly 
infusion to continuous infusions for [ADDRESS_386827] s received treatment for several weeks  (See I nvestigators Brochure ).  
Adverse events occurring in the si ngle agent studies  that resulted in discontinuation from the 
studies  were myalgia ([ADDRESS_386828] s), acute transient reaction (dyspnea, flushing, hypotension, and 
bradycardia; [ADDRESS_386829] s each), phlebitis (attributed to ethanol in the formulations, [ADDRESS_386830] s), 
fatigue ([ADDRESS_386831] s), and [ADDRESS_386832] pain, dehydration, dysphagia, 
hematuria, nausea, skin rash, subclavian vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and vomiting.  The 
following AEs were associated with death in the single agent tr ials: cardiac arrest (2), hypotensive 
with evidence of renal and hepatic failure (1), perforated gastric ulcer (1), renal function decline 
with cardiac arrest and perforated gastric ulcer (1; PIs considered not related to bryostatin), and 
sudden death (1; PIs considered likely to be cardiovascular event).  Relatedness to bryostatin 
treatment was not assessed except where noted.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 22 of 74 Other severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs reported in the single agent clinical studies  in cancer 
subject s included: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (elevated; subject  had pre -existing liver metastases),

syncope, and urinary frequency.  
The absence of a Placebo -contr ol group in bryostatin oncology studies  makes it difficult to 
determine the extent to which underlying disease or concomitant medications may have  
contributed to this safety profile.   
2.1 Alzheimer’s  Disease  Data 
2.1.1 Study NTRP101 -202 
NTRP 101 -202 was a  randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, phase 2 trial assessing the 
safety and tolerability (primary objective)  and efficacy (secondary objective) of bryostatin in the 
treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer’s disease subjects.  Exploratory objectives 
characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of bryostatin in this subject 
population. Seven doses of study drug were administered by a 45 -minute continuous intravenous 
(IV) infusion over 12 weeks.   
 
2.1.2 Methodology  
Eligible subjects with moderately severe to severe AD were stratified based on Mini Mental State 
Exam (MMSE -2) scores 4 -9 vs. 10 -15 and randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms: 20μg, 
40μg, or placebo for twelve weeks. Trial drug was administered IV  by [CONTACT_3365]. The  
first two doses (24μg, 48μg) of each of the two active treatment arms were a loading dose, 
20% higher than the assigned dose (20μg, 40μg), and were administered one week apart. 
Thereafter, the assigned dose commenced with the t hird dose and was administer ed every other 
week. Subjects were scheduled to receive seven doses over [ADDRESS_386833] dose of trial drug 
administration.  
 
2.1.3 Demographics  
A total of 264 subjects were screened in the trial. Of these, 147 subjects were randomized on a 
1:1:[ADDRESS_386834] (IP) and were included in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS). A total of 135 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_386835] -baseline eff icacy assessment and were analyzed as the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS). A total of 113 subjects out of 147 randomized (76.9%) performed a Week 13 evaluation of 
the SIB and were analyzed as the Completer Analysis Set (CAS). A total of 106 subjects in the 
SAS com pleted the trial (75.2%). A total of [ADDRESS_386836] common reason for early withdrawal was withdrawal of 
consent (18 subjects), followed by [CONTACT_117795] (11  subjects).  
 
2.1.4 Safety  
Overall, the 20 μg bryostatin treatment group  showed minimal differences from the placebo 
treatment group in safety assessments. The 40μg bryostatin  treatment group had significantly 
greater AEs than the other treatment groups. There was also no clear difference in Serious Adverse 
events (SAEs) between the 20μg bryostatin group and placebo treatment groups, and again the 
40μg bryostatin treatment grou p had significantly greater SAEs than the other treatment group.  
Similarly, the placebo and 20μg group had similar numbers of TEA Es (28 events vs 30  events, 
respectively). The TEAEs observed more often in the 20μg treatment group vs placebo were 
infusion site reaction (8 events vs 3 events in placebo) and diarrhea (5  events vs 1 event in 
placebo). The 40μg treatment group was associated with more TEAEs than either the 20μg or 
placebo treatment groups across multiple system organ classes (SOC).  
The most co mmon treatment related TEAEs were grouped infusion reactions, diarrhea, headache, 
fatigue, and myalgia. Myalgia was seen in 5 subjects; 4 of those subjects were given the higher 
dose of bryostatin. Myalgia observed was mostly mild and managed with analgesi cs. There were 
also more treatment related TEAEs of diarrhea, headache,  and fatigue in the higher dose bryostatin 
group. Both bryostatin treatment groups reported higher rates of infusion site TEAEs, and in 
particular the 40μg bryostatin treatment group re ported 4 events of infusion site cellulitis. 
Although IV infusion -related reactions were also reported more often in the higher dose bryostatin 
group, none were reported following WebEx -based training on IV infusion and universal 
precautions, suggesting th at this AE can be prevented.   The higher dose bryostatin group also 
reported more TEAEs of seizure and fall compared to the lower dose bryostatin and placebo 
groups.  
A total of 97 (68.8%) subjects in all treatment groups reported 287 separate TEAEs. Of th ese, 49 
(34.8%) subjects reported 107 separate treatment -related TEAEs. There were 8 (16.7%) subjects 
with 20 treatment -related TEAEs in the placebo treatment group, 17 (37.0%) subjects with 30 
events in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 24 (51.1%) subjects with 57 events in the 40μg 
bryostatin treatment group. Six  subjects had a TEAE that lead to trial drug discontinuation, 2 in the 
placebo treatment group, 1 in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 3 in the 40μg bryostatin 
treatment group.   Over all, 43 (30.5%) subjects had a TEAE that was mild in intensity, 
46 (32.6%)  subjects had a TEAE that was moderate in intensity, and 8  (5.7%)  subjects had a 
TEAE that was severe in intensity.  
There was [ADDRESS_386837] in the 40μg bryostatin t reatment group who suffered a 
severe TEAE of worsening of AD that was unrelated to the IP.  
There were 12 (8.5%) subjects who had 14 treatment emergent non -fatal SAEs during the trial; 4 
subjects with 4 events in the placebo treatment group, 2 subjects wit h 2 events in the 20μg 
bryostatin treatment group, and 6 subjects with 8 SAEs in the 40µg bryostatin treatment group. A 
total of 4 subjects in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group had 4  events that were judged as possibly 
or probably related to the IP: 3 ev ents of cellulitis, and 1  event of seizure.  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_386838] vital signs, PEs, 
and ECG. However, ther e was a decline in weight in the bryostatin groups, which was more 
prominent in the higher dose group: 20μg bryostatin treatment group (mean loss of -1.65±2.77kg) 
and the 40μg bryostatin treatment group ( -2.98±2.10kg), while there was a slight weight gain in the 
placebo treatment group (0.442±2.52kg). Further, [ADDRESS_386839] during the 
trial. 
 
2.1.5 Efficacy  
Consistent with the initial hypothesis for bryostatin effects on PKC ε and cognition, treatment with 
20μg of bryostatin is effective in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in a FAS and CAS. The 
overall weight of data shows that subjects treated with 20μg  bryostatin displayed significant 
improvement on the SIB, ADCS -ADL -Sev, and other secondary and exploratory endpoints  (one-
sided at α=0.10) , as outlined below.  
Baseline scores on the SIB for the FAS were similar across all treatment groups. In the FAS, the 
treatment difference between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg  bryostatin treatment group 
was statistically significant only at Week 5 (treatment difference 3.0[0.6, 5.3] 80%CI  P=0.056). There 
were no statistically significant differences between the placebo treatment group and either the 
20μg  bryostatin treatment group or 40μg  bryostatin treatment group at Week 9 or Week 13. 
Combining the bryostatin treatment groups and comparing with the placebo treatment group also 
did not produce a statistically si gnificant difference at any time point.  
For the CAS, pre -specified along with FAS to assess primary and secondary endpoints, mean 
scores on the SIB followed the same pattern seen in the FAS. Baseline scores were similar across 
all treatment groups. There was a statistically significant difference, however, between the placebo 
treatment group and the 20μg  bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.016), and the treatment 
difference at Week 13 was also statistically significant (P=0.070). Further, when both b ryostatin 
treatment groups were pooled, there was a statistically significant difference between the placebo 
treatment group and pooled group at Week 5 (P=0.039) and a statistically significant treatment 
difference at Week 13 (P=0.094). There were no stati stically significant differences between the 
placebo treatment group and the 40μg  bryostatin treatment group at any time point.  
In the CAS there were significant differences in the ADCS -ADL -Sev at Week 13 between the 
placebo treatment group and the 20μg  bryostatin treatment group (P=0.082), and between the 
placebo treatment group and pooled bryostatin treatment group (P=0.087). There were no 
statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the ADCS -ADL -Sev, MMSE -2, 
NPI, or CGI -I assays for  any time point in the FAS.  
In multiple exploratory analyses adjusting for covariates for the primary endpoint, there were 
additional significant differences between the placebo treatment group and bryostatin treatment 
groups. In an MMRM analysis of change  from baseline in SIB total score, excluding all subjects 
from sites that recruited 2 or fewer subjects during the trial, there was a significant difference 
between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 
(P=0.068). Th ere was a significant difference between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg

bryostatin treatment group in an MMRM analysis of change from baseline in SIB tot al score at the 
30-day follow up visit (P=0.041). When an ANCOVA was performed to assess site effect on SIB, 
there was a significant difference between the placebo treatment group and 20μg bryostatin 
treatment group (P=0.032), and between the placebo treat ment group and pooled bryostatin 
treatment groups (P=0.049) at Week 5. In an ANCOVA of change from baseline in SIB total score, 
with use of AChEI or memantine at baseline as an additional covariate, at Week 5 the 20μg 
bryostatin treatment group and pooled bryostatin treatment groups had statistically significant 
treatment differences from the placebo treatment group (P=0.024 and P=0.027, respectively).  
In multiple exploratory analyses adjusting for covariates for secondary endpoints, there were 
statistical ly significant differences between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin 
treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.062), and the placebo treatment group and pooled bryostatin 
treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.041) when performing an ANVOCA of change from b aseline in 
ADCS -ADL -Sev total score for subjects with > median baseline ADCS -ADL -Sev total score. 
There was a statistically significant difference between the placebo and 40μg bryostatin treatment 
groups at Week 5 (P=0.099) in an ANCOVA of change from base line in NPI [INVESTIGATOR_314316]. When performing an ANVOCA of change from baseline in NPI [INVESTIGATOR_314317] > median baseline NPI [INVESTIGATOR_182913], there were statistically significant differences between the 
placebo treatment group a nd the 40μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 9 (P=0.054) and Week 
13 (P -0.096).  
No clear differences were apparent between treatment groups for Caregiver distress on the NPI, 
each NPI [INVESTIGATOR_314318], or on the NPI [ADDRESS_386840] response 
compared to placebo or the 40μg  bryostatin treatment group.  
There was a significant difference in the FAS between the p lacebo treatment group and the 20μg 
bryostatin treatment group (P=0.031), and between the placebo treatment group and the pooled 
bryostatin treatment group (P=0.041) in an MMRM analysis of change from baseline in SIB total 
score at the [ADDRESS_386841] tertile of bryostatin  dose in general had a better 
response to treatment than higher tertiles or placebo (th ese data w ere also not analyzed 
statistically). Subjects treated with bryostatin who did not take memantine at baseline had 
significantly better improvement in SIB score  compared to the placebo group in an MMRM 
analyses of SIB total score in both the CAS and FAS. Both the pooled bryostatin and 20μg 
bryostatin treatment groups had significantly better scores than the placebo treatment group at 
Weeks 5, 13, and at 30 -day Fo llow-up. Similar results (which were not statistically analyzed) were 
seen in the ADCS -ADL -Sev test and in the NPI 10 -item score.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 26 of 74 2.1.6 Pharmacokinetics  
Mean plasma bryostatin concentrations increased approximately proportional to dose for an  
increase in dose b etween 20 μg and 40 μg, infused IV over 45 minutes. The median Tmax 
occurred at the end of the 45 -min infusion.  
Mean Cmax ranged from 0.563 ng/mL to 0.653 ng/mL after 20 μg and from 0.792 ng/mL to  
1.34 ng/mL after 40 μg. Mean T1/2 ranged from 1.33 h to 5.3 7 h.  Mean CL was similar for both 
dose levels and ranged from 24.97 L/h to 28.42 L/h for Weeks 0 and 3. The mean CL on Weeks 7 
and 11 was slightly lower, ranging from 13.38 L/h to 23.91 L/h.  
Within a given dose level, the ranges of values for Cmax, AUClas t, and AUCinf were consistent  
across weeks and there was no indication of systemic accumulation of bryostatin during 
administration of bryostatin once every [ADDRESS_386842] common treatment related TEAEs were diarrhea, headache, 
fatigue, and myalgia, and all were reported in greater frequency with the 40μg dose of bryostatin. 
Subjects given the 40μg dose of bryostatin also reported more TEAEs of seizur e and fall.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the SIB and secondary efficacy endpoint for the ADCS -ADL -
Sev was met in the CAS with the 20μg  dose, which was statistically significantly different from 
placebo at Weeks 5 and 13 . The 40μg  dose was not statisti cally significant from the placebo.  
SIB improvement was significant for the Week 5 FAS measurement (p< .056). No other primary 
or secondary endpoints were met in the FAS.  
Multiple exploratory analyses in the FAS for covariates in the primary and secondary  endpoints 
revealed additional significant differences, but these occurred predominantly at the Week [ADDRESS_386843] s with mild to moderate AD (MMSE: 14 -26).  Subject s were randomized 2:1 
to receive bryostatin 25µg/m2 or Placebo .  The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of bryostatin by [CONTACT_65094] .  Secondary safety endpoints included 
assessment of physical examination, hematology including  complete blood count (CBC) and 
platelet count , coagulation  parameters , serum chemistries , ECG, urinalysis and vital signs.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was a com posite end point of change from baseline in the Hopkins 
Verbal Learning Test -Revised  (HVLT -R) delayed recall and Repeatable Battery of Assessments 
for Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS) figure recall at [ADDRESS_386844] study drug  infusion.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 27 of 74 The study included single dose PK, and measurement of PKCε in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) as a potential biomarker.  
 
2.2.1 Results  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Demographic s 
The study enrolled nine subject s, 4 male and 5 female,  with a mean age of 71.8 ± 7.4 years (range 
62 to 82).  The mean MMSE -2 at baseline was 22.5 for the three p lacebo  subjects (range 19 -24) 
and 22 (range 16 -26) for the six bryostatin treated subject s. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  
Bryostatin was well tolerated.  There were no deaths or SAEs  reported .  No subjects had an AE 
leading to withdra wal during the study.  There were five treatment emergent adverse events 
occurring in three  subject s: headache, dizziness, and papular rash.  There were no reported 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_314319], a known side effect of bryost atin.  The only adverse event in the bryostatin 
treated group was headache, which was not considered related to study drug .  All adverse events 
were mild and resolved without treatment.  All laboratory assessments, including hematology, 
chemistry, coagulat ion, renal function and liver function as well as cardiac assessments were 
unremarkable after treatment and there was no clinically significant change in any vital signs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficac y  
There was no difference in HVLT -R delayed recall or the RBANS delay ed figure recall at 48 
hours.  Additional time points of assessment for these measures (day 2, day 4 and day 15) did not 
indic ate any difference between groups.  Additional endpoints included the change from baseline 
in Digit Symbol Coding (DSC), and MMSE -[ADDRESS_386845] after  a single dose of 255μg/m2 bryostatin.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of bryostatin were assessed in [ADDRESS_386846] s following 25 g/m2 bryostatin 
administered as a single 1 -hour IV infusion.  Individual bryostatin plasma conce ntrations were 
observed to increase and approac h stead y-state within the 1 hour infusion periods, and then rapi[INVESTIGATOR_314320].  The bryostatin maximum plasma concentrations 
occurred at the end of the IV infusions, and had a mean ( ±standard deviation (SD) ) value of 1.09 
±0.25 ng/mL.  A terminal elimination rate could not be calculated for most subject s due to 
sampling  frequency , the rapid drug elimination, and the sensitivity limitations of the assay.  Based 
on the observed individual bryostatin plasma concentration profiles, the elimination t 1/2 associated 
with the observed drug exposure was estimated to be less than 30 minutes .  Total drug CL was

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 28 of 74 observed to be high (~ 40 L/h), consistent across the individual administered doses, and did not 
appear to be related to body weight, BSA, or sex.  The bryostatin pharmacokinetic parameters 
were observed to have low to moderate intersu bject variability.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamics/ PKC ε 
Preliminary assessment of PKCε concentration in PBMCs suggests there is an incre ase in the total 
amount of PKCε (cytosol plus membrane bound  concentration ) following treatment with 
bryostatin.  Additional analysis is underway to further characterize the increase and 
pharmacodynamics.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Conclusions  
This was the first double -blind assessment  of the safety of bryostatin treatment in subjects with 
Alzheimer’s disease.  The study met it primary endpoint of safety and toler ability.  Bryostatin 
appears safe and we ll tolerated in this cohort of subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s 
disease.  No improvement was detected in cognitive function on the efficacy measurements  though 
the study was not powered to detect cognitive benefit.  There was no evidence of an adverse effect 
on cognition following treatment with bryostatin.   
 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND HYPOTHESIS  
3.0 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the safety , tolerability and efficacy of bryostatin for the treatment of moderately severe 
to severe Alzheimer’s disease  in subjects not receiving concurrent memantine treatment . 
3.1 Hypothesis   
Patients treated with bryostatin  will experience a greater improvement in cognitive function as 
measured by [CONTACT_314370] 12 weeks of treatment, as 
compared to patients on placebo during the same time period.  The null hypothesis will be rej ected 
at a significance level of a two -sided α = 0.05. The test of the null hypothesis will be a superiority 
test based on the two -sample t -test, and only an improvement in the SIB score from baseline is of 
clinical significance.  
  
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.0 Overview of  Study Design    
This is a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled exploratory study  assessing bryostatin for 
the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer’s disease  in subjects not receiving 
memantine treatment .  The study is [ADDRESS_386847] treatment. Eligible subjects will be stratified based on  MMSE -2 scores 4 -9 
vs. 10 -15 and will be randomized 1:1 to treatmen t with  20µg  bryostatin  or placebo  for 12 weeks  of 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_386848] two doses of study drug 
will be a loading dose 20% higher (i.e., 24µg)  than the assigned dose and will be administered one 
week apart. Thereafter, the assigned dose of 20µg will commence with the third dose and be 
administered every other week.   Subjects are scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks.   
Safety and efficac y assessments will be done as indicated on the Schedule of Activities  (Table  1).  
4.[ADDRESS_386849] of myalgia is dose dependent and 
cumulative and likely related to the down regulation of PKC ε.  This was not seen in the NTRP101 -
201 study, in which there were no reports of myalgia  after a single 25µg/m2 dose of bryostatin was 
administered , nor in the recently completed NTRP101 -[ADDRESS_386850].  In NTRP101 -202, in which subjects received 7 
doses of study drug, myalgia was seen in 5 subjects; 4 of those subjects were given the h igher 40 
µg dose of bryostatin. Myalgia observed was mostly mild and managed with analgesics.  
Dosing in this study will begin with two initial loading doses at  one-week intervals that are 20 % 
higher than the maintenance dose to assure enzyme activation. Do sing will then continue every 
other week.  
4.2 Risk/Benefit  
Bryostatin treatment in study NTRP101 -[ADDRESS_386851] hoc  analysis in NTRP101 -202 clearly 
showed that bryostati n-treated subjects who did not take memantine at baseline had significantly 
better improvement in SIB score compared to the placebo group in an MMRM  analyses  of SIB 
total score in both the CAS and FAS. Both the pooled bryostatin  (20 μg and 40 μg)  and 20μg 
bryostatin treatment groups had significantly better scores than the placebo treatment group at 
Weeks 5, 13, and at [ADDRESS_386852] been associated with the occurrence of amyloid 
related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which is similar in appearance to cerebral vasogenic edema 
and microhemo rrhage.  A minority of cases have been associated with symptoms of headache, 
visual disturbance, loss of coordination, or disorientation.  Asymptomatic ARIA was reported in a 
clinical study of the small molecule gamma -secretase inhibitor BMS -708163.  Bryos tatin has a 
different mechanism of action than antibodies directed at amyloid, but in the transgenic mouse 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_386853] no alternative treatments available.  Based on the available nonclinical 
and clinical data, and th e low risk of ARIA, the potential benefits of treatment with bryostatin at 
the proposed dose in this protocol outweigh the risks.

collected at time points  specified in the Schedule of Activities.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C-SSRS is an interview -based rating s cale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and 
suicidal behavior.  The scale should be administered by [CONTACT_314377], who has also taken the specific rater training for the scale, which will be provided by [CONTACT_314378] o f the Sponsor prior to the study start.  If at any visit from baseline on, there are “YES”

the C -SSRS on more than one occasion during a study  should be discontinued from the study .  
Suicidality AEs or other clinical observations may, based on the judgment of the PI, also trigger 
a risk assessment and a narrative.  When there is a positive response to any question on the C -
SSRS, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_314326].  
6.1.2 Efficacy  / Psychometric Assessments  
All raters for the efficacy assessments need to be trained and qualified on the administration of 
the scales.  A qualified  rater is required for the administration of  the SIB, NPI [INVESTIGATOR_314327] -2.  
The same qualified rater should perform a given Efficacy/Psychometric Assessment at 
approximately the same time of day for a given subject throughout the study.  All changes in 
raters for a given assessments must be noted in the subject’s source d ocuments.   The caregiver 
designated to provide assessments ( ADCS -ADL -Sev and NPI) at the start of the study should be  
the same individual throughout the study.  Should a change be necessary during the course of the 
study, the reason for the change and the first corresponding visit must be noted in the subject’s 
source document.  
All psychometric tests performed on study s ubjects on the same day should be administered in 
the following order: SIB followed by [CONTACT_157513] -2, except at the screening visit  as described in 
Section 6.2.1 . If the MMSE -2 score obtained at screening does not fall within the 4 -15 range for 
inclusion, no furt her screening tests should be performed.  Efficacy  tests at subsequent visits 
should be administered prior to dosing . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rosen -Modified Hachinski Scale  
The Rosen -Modified Hachinski  Scale will be evaluated at screening to differentiate Alzheimer’s 
type dementia from multi -infarct dementia.  The 8 -item scale results in a score of 0 -12; and a 
score of 5 or above is exclusionary for the  study . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severe Impairment Battery  
The SIB is used to assess cognition in subject s with moderate and severe AD.   It is divided into 
nine subscales that include attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, 
construction, social ski lls, orienting head to name.  Non-verbal responses are allowed, thus 
decreasing the need for language output.  Forty  questions are included with a point score range 
of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mini Mental State Examination, 2nd Edition  
The Standard version of the MMSE -2, with two alternate forms,  will be used.  This version has 
the structure and scoring of the original [ADDRESS_386880] for assessing overall cognitive state.  The MMSE -2 
measures selected aspects of cognition such as memory, orientation, attention, language, and 
praxis on a scale of 0 -30.  Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.

both frequency and severity.   Total scores range from 0 -120 with higher scores indicating greater 
behavioral disturbances.  For each item, the associated caregiver distress is also assessed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale  
The CGI -I is used to assess global change in the subject’s condition compared to baseline before 
treatment.  The same Clinician must complete the CGI -I scale at each scheduled visit. This is a 
seven -point scale ranging from (1) very much improved to (7) very much wo rse. 
6.2 Visit Procedures  
6.2.1 Screening and Randomization (Days -28 to -2) 
In order to avoid unnecessary screen failures, a prescreening telephone call to rule out clearly 
exclusionary conditions is advised prior to scheduling a screening visit.  Informed Consent must 
be obtained before any study related procedures are performed. Screening procedures and 
randomization will take place within a n approximate  4-week period prior to first dose 
administration (Days -28 to -2).   
Subjects who are screen -failed (e.g. due to clinically significant laboratory abnormality or an 
active medical condition) may be re -screened if their medical condition stabilizes or improves as 
assessed by [CONTACT_978].  Subject who are screen -failed due to MMSE score may be rescreened in [ADDRESS_386884] s:

medication (either partial or completed infusions of bryostatin or placebo ).  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) used for efficacy analyses, consistent with the  modified  intention -
to-treat ( mITT) principles, is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose 
of study medication and who have at least one post -baseline efficacy assessment.  
 
The completer analysis set (CAS) will be defined as all randomized subjects who completed [ADDRESS_386905] disposition will be summ arized by [CONTACT_314389], 
randomized, dosed and withdrawn with reason for withdrawal.  
9.2 Exploratory Analysis  
Descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_314390]. These descr iptive statistics will include the mean, median, SD, maximum and minimum for 
continuous variables, and frequencies, percentage, and tabulations for categorical variables. 
Summary statistics will also be performed on both the patient demographics and patien t clinical 
characteristics. Exploratory plots of the data  will also be created, including box plots and 
histograms, in order to determine the distribution of these data as well as to identify any unusual 
or outlying observations.

Version 3.0  09 May 201 9 Page 56 of 74 9.3 Safety Analysis  
The SAS  population will be used for all safety analyses with treatment group determined by [CONTACT_314391]. The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) is defined as all randomized subjects 
who received any study medication (either partial or completed infusion s of bryostatin or 
placebo). AEs, safety laboratory, ECGs, physical exam and vital signs data will be presented in 
tabular format and summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  No formal hypothesis testing 
will be carried out on these safety assessments .  Incidence and severity of AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_314392] (SOC).  AEs will be coded according 
to standard MedDRA terms.  
C-SSRS responses will be mapped onto the Columbia -Classification Algorithm of Suicide 
Assessment ( C-CASA) scale, and the frequency distribution of the C -CASA scores will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_67486].  No hypotheses associated with the C -SSRS or C -
CASA scales will be tested.  
Subject disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_21747] d will include numbers screened, 
randomized, dosed and withdrawn with reason for withdrawal.  
9.4 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is the change  from baseline to Week 13 in the SIB total 
score.  The primary analysis will be conducted on FAS population . The CAS population will be 
used as a supportive analysis.   All statistical tests for efficacy will be two -sided tests, with 
α=0.05.  
   
Based on the review of patients not treated with memantine in t he NTRP 101 -202 clinical trial, 
the expected number of  patients who will drop out of the study prematurely will not be 
significant.  For efficacy evaluations, multiple imputation methods will be used to handle missing 
data. This imputation method is a robus t method to impute missing measurements. The 
imputation will be carried out in SAS version 9.4 or later using PROC MI. Each imputation 
model will include the stratification factor (i.e., MMSE -2 score (4 -9 vs. 10 -15)) as a covariate in 
the model. .

16 APPENDIX 3  SUMMARY OF CHANGE S 
16.1 Version 2.0 , 21 Aug 2018  
Global changes:  
• Neurotrope change of address and logo have been updated.  
• Spelling correction: ADCS -ADL -Sev replaces ADCS -ADL -Siv in the list of 
abbreviations and wherever it occurs in the document  
• IRT (Interactive Response Technology) replaces IwRS (Interactive Web Response 
System) in the lis t of abbreviations and wherever it occurs in the document.  
Inclusion criterion #4 clarification: MMSE -2 inclusion range of 4 -15 applies to screening 
criterion only and may deviate from this range during study participation.  
Inclusion criterion #5: The uppe r limit SIB score for inclusion has been changed from 97 to 93 to 
optimize measurement of improvement.  
Exclusion Criterion #4: Text has been added to describe parameters for eligibility with medical 
history of cancer: If there is a h istory of cancer the su bject should be clear of cancer for at least 2 
years prior to screening . More recent history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma and 
melanoma in situ (Stage 0) may be acceptable after review by [CONTACT_1689].  
Section 5.3: Since all site personne l are blinded, there is no need to exclude individuals preparing 
study drug from participation in safety or efficacy assessments. The sentence “The individual 
designated to prepare the study drug may not participate in any study subject  safety or efficacy 
evaluations.” has been removed.  
Section 5.5: Text has been added to describe randomization procedure details. The text now 
reads: “ Once all eligibility criteria for the study have been met,  and the site has received 
approval by [CONTACT_1689] (MM) and Clinical Assessment Technologies (CAT) group, via 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-[ADDRESS_386926] can be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) 
system.”   
Section 6.0, Table 1 Schedule of Activi ties: A footnote has been added to clarify time window 
for the screening window. The visit window of ±2 Days for scheduled study visits does not 
apply to the screening and randomization period which is a maximum of 28 days.  
Section 6.1.2: Text has been cla rified to be consistent with Section 6.2.1. The MMSE -[ADDRESS_386927] re -screening: Subjects who are screen -
failed (e.g. due to clinically significant laboratory abnormality or an active medical condition) 
may be re -screened if their medical condition stabilizes or improves as assessed by [CONTACT_978].  
Subjects who ar e screen -failed due to MMSE score may be rescreened in 3 months. The Medical 
Monitor should be consulted prior to re -screening. Subjects who are Screen Failures may be 
rescreened only once.   
Section 14, Appendix 1 Restricted Concomitant Medications:  Memant ine has been removed 
from the list of allowed AD medications.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_386928] been made to study procedures.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was described in previous versions as the  change in the Severe 
Impairment Battery (SIB) scale score after 12 weeks of treatment from baseline (taking the 
change in the average of SIB measures observed during the Week 13 to Week 15 time window 
from SIB at baseline).    
The revised text is: The primary efficacy endpoint is  defined as the change from baseline to 
Week 13 in the SIB total score .  This change was made to assure consistency with the primary 
analysis endpoint as analyzed in study NTRP101 -202, for which NTRP101 -203 is considered a 
confirmatory study.  
Secondary endpoints were added to an alyze the changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9, 13 and 15 
in the SIB total score for subjects enrolled in the MMSE -2 4-9 stratification group and the 
MMSE -2 10-15 stratification group. Similar analysis methods as the primary endpoint will be 
used for analys is of these endpoints.

testing a cluster randomized
implementation trial

Background: Over 1100 Veterans work in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as peer specialists (PSs). PSs are
Veterans with formal training who provide support to other Veterans with similar diagnoses, primarily in mental
health settings. A White House Executive Action mandated the pi[INVESTIGATOR_873116] 25 primary care Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) in order to broaden the provision of wellness services that
can address many chronic illnesses. An evaluation of this initiative was undertaken to assess the impact of outside
assistance on the deployment of PS in PACT, as implementation support is often needed to prevent challenges
commonly experienced when first deploying PSs in VHA settings. We present the protocol for this cluster-randomized
hybrid type II trial to test the impact of standard implementation (receive minimal assistance) vs. facilitated
implementation (receive outside assistance) on the deployment of VHA PSs in PACT.
Methods: A VHA Office of Mental Health Services work group is recruiting [ADDRESS_1219575]. Sites in three successive cohorts ( n=8 ,8 ,9 )
beginning over 6-month blocks will be matched and randomized to either standard or facilitated implementation. In
facilitated implementation, an outside expert works with site stakeholders through a site visit, regular calls, and
performance data to guide the planning and address chall enges. Standard implementation sites will receive a
webinar and access the Office of Mental Health Services work group. The two conditions will be compared on PS
workload data, fidelity to the PS model of service delivery, team functioning, and Veteran measures of activation,
satisfaction, and functioning. Qualitative interviews will collect information on implementation barriers and
facilitators.
Discussion: This evaluation will provide cri tical data to guide administrato rs and VHA policy makers on future
deployment of PSs, as their role has been expanding beyond mental health. In addition, development of novel
implementation strategies (facilitation tailored to PS s) and the use of new tools (peer fidelity) can be models for
monitoring and supporting deployment of PSs throughout VHA.

higher rates of common diseases, e.g., cardiovascular,
lung, and digestive [1 –12], and worse health outcomes
associated with those conditions compared to the gen-
eral population. Those with mental illness have higher
risk for certain lifestyle choices (e.g., obesity, physical in-
activity, smoking, and drug use) that contribute to
chronic medical illness [13 –23], and have a higher mor-
tality rate than the general population as a result [2, 3,
13, 14, 19]. These poor outcomes increase healthcare
spending, as 75% of the Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) healthcare dollars are spent on these chronic dis-
eases [5].
A key driver for poor outcomes is that those with
mental illness often have low “patient activation, ”or the
knowledge, skill, efficacy, and beliefs for managing per-
sonal health and healthcare [24]. For example, they may
not verbalize concerns, [4, 14, 25, 26] or they may deny
illness, [27] be reluctant to see non-mental health pro-
viders [28], accept medical care that is inadequate, [29]
or have difficulty accessing care in systems that are often
poorly coordinated [30]. Thus, a key area for interven-
tion is to increase the activation of Veterans with mental
illness receiving services in primary care. Research shows
that more “activated ”individuals engage more in self-
management (e.g., medication adherence, diet, exercise),
disease prevention (e.g., screenings), and health-
information seeking [31] and as a result, have better
health, functioning, quality of life, and higher satisfaction
with their care [32, 33].
To improve services for Veterans, VHA has developed
new primary care structures such as Patient Aligned
Care Teams (PACT; [34]) to serve as “medical homes ”
that provide coordinated, comprehensive outpatient
care. VHA PACT, first established in 2010, provide out-
patient primary care services through patient-centered
medical “teamlets ”, each of which coordinates compre-
hensive care for approximately 1200 Veterans [34].
PACT teamlets typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] a primary care phys-
ician, a care manager (RN), a medical assistant or LPN,
and an administrative clerk. However, even with
PACT, Veterans with mental illnesses often receive
disparately poor care because of low patient activation
w h i c hi sn e e d e dt oe n s u r ep r o p e rh e a l t ha n du s eo f
healthcare [24].
There is emerging evidence that peer specialists
(PSs) —individuals with mental illness hired and trained
to serve Veterans in specialty mental health clinics based
upon their lived experiences [35] —could be a viable op-
tion to provide basic coaching to improve patient activa-
tion and the health of those with mental illness. PSs are
Veteran employees with significant recovery from ser-
ious mental illness or substance abuse disorders, whoare then trained to provide ongoing support to other
Veterans with similar disorders. Their role is unique in
that they draw upon their own recovery experience to
inform their support of Veterans. The shared experience
of military service also fosters trust between PS and the
Veterans with whom they serve. The specific roles filled
by [CONTACT_873131]-
clude facilitating groups, role modeling, providing
outreach and support, teaching copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], case man-
agement and liaison between Veteran and mental health
system. While not conclusive, randomized and quasi-
experimental trials have shown that those mental ill-
nesses who receive PS services benefit across a wide
range of outcomes [35].
Recently, the PS role has been extended to providing
wellness-oriented, health services. Druss [36] used PSs
in an adaptation of Lorig ’s Chronic Disease Self-
Management Program (CDSMP), which originally used
community lay leaders to teach patients with diverse
chronic diseases self-management skills. In a small ran-
domized trial ( n= 80) involving PSs, intervention partici-
pants had significantly greater improvement in patient
activation than those in usual care. Participants also ex-
perienced improvements in physical health-related qual-
ity of life, physical activity, and medication adherence
similar to those in Lorig ’sw o r ki nt h eg e n e r a lp o p u l a -
tion. Goldberg and colleagues [37] evaluated another
adaptation of CDSMP called Living Well, which also
used PSs, and found significant improvements in
functioning, self-efficacy, patient activation, and self-
management.
The use of PSs in a primary care setting is still rela-
tively new. For example, while almost [ADDRESS_1219578] 2014, the White House
issued an Executive Action mandating that 25 Veterans
Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs), for the first time,
pi[INVESTIGATOR_873117] [38]. Health coaching is a patient-centered ap-
proach that includes assessing needs, developi[INVESTIGATOR_629745]-
crete goals and a plan to reach those goals, and skill
building. Providers partner with patients to identify
health behavior changes and create action steps and
follow-up plans to make those changes. Given the “here
and now ”emphasis of goal planning, services are meant
to be brief, between one and eight sessions. Sites have
been offered to have their PSs trained in health coaching
by [CONTACT_873132]. While no additional funds were
made available, VA Central Office invited all VAMCs to
move between 0.[ADDRESS_1219579]
at their site to address the executive action.
Over and above the VA Central Office invitation, re-
search shows that proactive strategies are needed to fa-
cilitate successful adoption of new interventions [39],Chinman et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:[ADDRESS_1219580]
employing PSs [40 –49]. Hence, in partnership with vari-
ous VHA leaders, VA ’s Quality Enhancement Research
Initiative (QUERI) provided funding for a cluster ran-
domized trial comparing [ADDRESS_1219581]
implementation of PS. As is common in hybrid type II
designs [50], the project has a dual emphasis on the as-
sessment of both Veteran-level outcomes and uptake of
PS services. The clusters to be randomized are [ADDRESS_1219582] —which include their PSs, providers, and Veter-
ans—who will be randomly assigned to a study condition
(standard implementation vs. facilitated implementa-
tion). “Standard implementation ”is the treatment as
usual condition, in which sites receive minimal assist-
ance typi[INVESTIGATOR_873118]-outs in VHA. This
approach to implementation will include written guid-
ance (a toolkit on how to hire and integrate PSs into a
clinical setting), a 1-h webinar on integrating mental
health and primary care, and the option to call VHA
Central Office staff overseeing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_873119]-
sultation. Sites randomized to the “facilitated implemen-
tation ”condition will receive the same resources
augmented by [CONTACT_873133].
Facilitated implementation model and strategy
Proactive support for each site randomized to the facili-
tated implementation condition will be provided for
1 year by [CONTACT_873134]-level psychologiststrained in the facilitation model called Integrated Pro-
moting Action Research on Implementation in Health
Services (i-PARIHS) [51 –56]. According to i-PARIHS,
successful implementation of an innovation (in this case
PS on PACT) is the function of (1) characteristics of im-
plementation recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (such as their beliefs, skills, and
resources); (2) the existence and appraisal of the evi-
dence for an innovation by [CONTACT_873135][INVESTIGATOR_840]; (3) charac-
teristics of the immediate work setting or inner context
(e.g., leadership support, cu lture, organizational prior-
ities) and the wider health system or outer context
(e.g., policy drivers and priorities, incentives and man-
dates); and (4) the process by [CONTACT_873136] a site to help them adopt and
implement an innovation, i.e., facilitation , described
below [51].
Facilitators will engage in several strategies, tailored to
each location [57], including identifying and engaging
key stakeholders, opi[INVESTIGATOR_873120]; identifying problems and
finding solutions, providing assistance with technical is-
sues, developi[INVESTIGATOR_836265], pro-
viding evidence, marketing the use of PSs to PACT staff,
staff training, formative evaluation, and role modeling
[50, 55, 57 –59]. In this project, the facilitation is being
adapted to also incorporate lessons learned about the
implementation of PSs [24, 57]. The above strategies are
implemented in two phases, pre-implementation and
implementation, further described in Table 1.
The three facilitators are located in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA,
and thus most of the facilitation will take place via con-
ference call. Prior to initiating implementation activities
at each site (pre-implementation phase), the assigned ex-
ternal facilitator will interview designated internal cham-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_873121] ( recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] )t o
assess the inner and outer context , specifically focusing
on any existing barriers and facilitators to implementa-
tion. Based on these interviews, the facilitation team will

tasks that will be important for each site to address. In-
person site visits will then be conducted to (a) provide
evidence and education for the provision of PS services
in PACT to leadership, providers and administration
(innovation) ; (b) partner with the PACT team ( recipi-
ents) to develop an implementation plan tailored to site-
level needs ( inner context ), and (c) develop a plan to
monitor implementation. This monitoring (implementa-
tion phase) will include twice monthly meetings to help
facilities implement and refine their plans, review goals
and assess and address barriers. The process will be fur-
ther supported through the iterative feedback of data
gleaned through the capture of PS workload data
through the VHA electronic medical record. In addition,
two separate monthly “learning collaborative ”conference
calls will be held; one for PSs and one for PSs supervi-
sors. Facilitated by a consultant expert in PSs, these calls
will involve site staff meeting together to review imple-
mentation progress, share ideas and lessons learned, and
provide support.
Site recruitment and randomization
A convenience sample of [ADDRESS_1219585] sites will be re-
cruited through a work group of VHA leaders led by
[CONTACT_41309] ’s National Director of Peer Support and Na-
tional Director of Integrated Services. To participate,
sites pledge to dedicate one or more PSs to PACT for a
total of at least 10 h a week. In a brief application, in-
terested sites specify a local champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], the number
and make-up of the target population the PS will serve,
and specific objectives to be achieved. Site leadership
(site director, mental health and primary care leads)
must indicate their support. Recruited sites will be di-
vided into three cohorts ( n= 8, 8, 9). Each cohort will
begin over three successive 6-month blocks. The sites
in each cohort will be placed into matched pairs based
on the following variables: number of PSs deployed at
a site, number of hours each PS would provide in
PACT, the status of PS assignment to PACT (currently
deployed or anticipating deployment to PACT), and
employment status (currently hired or within the hir-
ing process). A statistician with no other direct in-
volvement in the project will use a computerized
random number generator to assign sites within each
pair to [ADDRESS_1219586] implementation ( n= 13) or
facilitated implementation ( n= 12). Blinding to assign-
ment will not be possible because it will be well known
who receives the facilitation. The project is considered
quality improvement by [CONTACT_41309]; thus, individual con-
sent will not be sought. However, individual Veterans
and staff will be asked for their assent after receiving
information about the project.Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis is guided by [CONTACT_39505]-AIM
evaluation framework, which is often used as a comple-
ment to i-PARIHS in implementation research [52, 61 –
63]. RE-AIM specifies five domains to judge successful
impact of an intervention: Reach (the spread of the
intervention to targeted individuals), Effectiveness (the
ability of the intervention to improve outcomes), Adop-
tion (the integration of the intervention into current
practice), Implementation (the fidelity with which the
intervention is delivered), and Maintenance (the sustain-
ability of the intervention over time). Reach, Adoption,
and Implementation will be assessed with a variety of
context and service delivery measures. The Effectiveness
domain will be assessed with Veteran-level measures.
The final domain, Maintenance, is assessed over time, by
[CONTACT_873139], service delivery, and Veteran-level
measures. Blinded primary data collection will not be
possible because the measures are self-report and re-
spondents will know their study condition.
Context measures
The Organizational Readiness for Change (ORC; [64])
measures organizational functioning and climate, con-
sistent with the inner and outer context factors of the i-
PARIHS framework, and was recently adapted for use
with VA providers treating those with mental illnesses
[65]. It assesses the following domains: motivation for
change, resources, staff attributes, organizational climate,
and training exposure and utilization. To minimize par-
ticipant burden as has been done in other VA imple-
mentation studies [65], only 10 of 23 ORC subscales (59
items total) will be administered. These subscales were
drawn from the domains of motivation for change (scales
including: program needs, training needs, and pressures
for change) resources (staffing) and organizational climate
(mission, cohesion, autonomy, communication, stress, and
change). The [ADDRESS_1219587] Cronbach ’sa l p h a
ranging from 0.57 to 0.87 [64], and in a recent systematic
review of instruments for measuring organizational readi-
ness for change, the ORC was rated as the most psycho-
metrically sound based on the Standards for Educational
and Psychological Testing, with evidence of multiple
forms of validity and reliability [66]. Via an email link to
an online survey portal, the ORC will be administered
only at baseline to all site staff involved with the Peers in
PACT project in any capacity.
The Team Development Measure (TDM; [67]) is a 10-
min, 31-item survey designed to measure and promote
quality improvement in team-based healthcare settings.
The TDM evaluates team development across four key
elements: cohesiveness, communication, role clarity, and
goals and means clarity. In psychometric testing of the
TDM in 145 healthcare teams ranging from 3 to 30Chinman et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:57 Page 4 of 9
members, the measure had a Cronbach ’s alpha of 0.97
and a Rasch/IRT: person reliability of 0.96 [67]. The
TDM will be completed by [CONTACT_873140]. While this will typi[INVESTIGATOR_94954]-
clude three to four individuals per team, the number will
vary as each site will define the scope of the PS role dif-
ferently (i.e., collaborate with one PACT teamlet vs. a
larger number of PACT staff). The TDM will be admin-
istered at baseline, [ADDRESS_1219588] ’s evalu-
ation, the results of both measures, along with available
normative data, will be used to support the facilitated
implementation process. To do this, external facilitators
will share the results of the site data and use ORC and
TDM normative data to review the results with the
PACT teams, pi[INVESTIGATOR_873123], and iden-
tify realistic action steps to improve team development
and functioning in service of supporting the integration
of PSs into the PACT team.
Qualitative interviews to assess key barriers and facili-
tators to integrating a PS into PACT will be developed
based on i-PARIHS [51], with questions derived from
generic items in the i-PARIHS Guide [68]. These inter-
views will be conducted with PSs and at least one other
PACT staff (usually the PS supervisor) at each site near
the end of facilitation. Through these 60 –90-min tele-
phone interviews ( n= 60), we will capture i-PARIHS ’
core elements of evidence, context, and facilitation. For
the sites receiving facilitated implementation, interviews
will include additional questions about that experience
(e.g., if and how they worked with the external facilitator,
what it was like, if it helped, what could have been bet-
ter). Interviews will be digitally audio-recorded and
transcribed.
Service delivery measures
Peer Workload. Services provided by [CONTACT_873141]. Both the number of
unique Veterans who receive PS services of those who
are eligible ( Reach) and the number of contacts provided
by [CONTACT_873142] ( Adoption) will be assessed. This
data will be obtained for all sites via biweekly data pulls
from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) con-
ducted by [CONTACT_873143] (VERC) at the VA Pi[INVESTIGATOR_108710].
VERC staff will develop a custom database from data
stored in the CDW utilizing SQL routines that can be
updated to include new project sites or PSs.
The Peer Fidelity Measure [69] is designed to assess
the services provided by [CONTACT_873144] ( Imple-
mentation). The measure addresses two broad domains:
(a) the degree to which a PS provides 16 differentservices shown to be critical for PSs according to the lit-
erature and expert panel (e.g., serving as a role model
for recovery; sharing recovery story; increasing client ’s
participation in own illness management) and (b) the de-
gree to which 16 different factors are having a positive
or negative influence on PS implementation (e.g., well
understood expectations for PS work, support for PS at
higher organizational levels, regular supervision, access
to education and training). Each service and implemen-
tation factor has one to two questions that asks about
their presence (responses ranging from 1 = not at all to
5 = very much). Although the measure is in early stages
of testing, preliminary results from a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_873124]-
tween PSs with fewer and greater years of experience
[69]. Results from this project will yield data that will be
used to further test its psychometric properties. There
are separate versions for PSs, their supervisors, and pa-
tients, but the items overlap in content. To allow time
for the PS to establish their services, each PS and their
supervisor will complete the measure [ADDRESS_1219589] service provided and again 6 months later (again, by
[CONTACT_873145]). All Veterans with whom
each PS works will be asked to complete the measure at
the 6- and 12-month survey timepoints along with the
outcome measures described below.
Veteran outcome measures
Veterans receiving PS services will be asked to complete
measures of activation, satisfaction and health status, in
addition to age, gender, race/ethnicity, service connec-
tion, medical diagnosis, and contact [CONTACT_3031]. At
baseline (before the first PS service contact), the PS will
collect the measures in person. At 6 and 12 months
(from first PS service contact), project staff will collect
the measures by [CONTACT_648].
The Satisfaction Index-Mental Health [70] is a 12-
item, unidimensional measure shown to be valid, reli-
able, and sensitive to change in a sample of Veterans
with mental illnesses being treated in primary care set-
tings. Six additional questions taken from VHA ’s annual
Survey of Health Experience of Veterans (SHEP) will be
added, including two Yes/No items: talked with your
provider about specific health goals, provider talked
about what makes it hard to take care of health (yes/no);
and four 5-point items (strongly agree to strongly dis-
agree): got service I needed, was easy to get the service I
needed, felt like a valued customer, trust VA to fulfill
our country ’s commitment to Veterans.
The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a 13-item
survey that measures an individual ’s perceived ability
to manage his or her illness and health behaviors and
act as an effective patient. It has been shown to be
reliable, valid, sensitive to change, and correlate withChinman et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:57 Page 5 of 9
measures of improved self-management and health
outcomes [31 –33].
One item from the VR-12 , a Veteran version of the SF-
36 Health Inventory [71 –73], will be used to assess gen-
eral health. The item, “In general, would you say your
health is …”asks Veterans to respond on a 5-point scale
ranging from excellent to poor. The use of this single
item is backed up by [CONTACT_873146], mortal-
ity, use of health services, changes in functioning, and
recovery from poor health [74].
Data analysis
The overall qualitative analysis strategy is described here.
Additional qualitative analysis description and the statis-
tical analyses are described under each hypothesis below.
Transcripts of the qualitative interviews will be analyzed
using rapid assessment, a team-based, iterative data col-
lection and analysis approach [75]. A transcript sum-
mary template with domains based on the elements of i-
PARIHS and other key topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (e.g., degree of PS ’s inte-
gration into the PACT, the experience of facilitated im-
plementation) will be collaboratively developed by [CONTACT_873147]. After testing and revising the template
with at least the first five transcripts, a finalized version
will be developed. Thereafter, evaluation team members
will independently use the summary template to closely
read each transcript and summarize content under each
domain, with periodic checks for consensus and reliabil-
ity. The use of a template will facilitate the rapid but
thorough review and reduction of data from a large
number of interviews, enabling the comparison and
identification of themes both within and across sites,
study conditions (standard or facilitated implementa-
tion), and stakeholder roles (PS or supervisor) [70]. Fur-
thermore, because preliminary analysis will begin as
soon as the first transcripts are available, this approach
will allow for iterative changes to the interview guides as
new questions arise from the analysis.
Hypothesis [ADDRESS_1219590] implementation
group.
Reach will be operationalized as the number of unique
patients seen by a PS, per hour of time a PS works per
month at the site. Sites vary in the number of hours per
week PSs are able to work (because sites were receiving
no additional funds to support the PSs, they had to use
existing PSs). Poisson regression will be used to model
the counts of unique patients seen per month over the
12-month implementation period. The number of hours
per month the PS was working will be used as an offsetto control for the different number of hours worked by
[CONTACT_873148]. A generalized linear mixed model will be used
to allow for missing data. Site and time will be included
in the model as random variables with intervention con-
dition as a fixed effect. The z-test of the time by [CONTACT_161047]-
vention condition interaction will be the test of the
hypothesis. The quantitative assessment of Reach will be
further enhanced by [CONTACT_873149]-
terviews, including descriptions of PSs ’caseload and pat-
terns of interaction with Veteran patients (e.g., in-person
meetings, follow-up phone calls, group setting contacts).
Adoption will be operationalized as the number PS
services (contacts) delivered, per hour of time a PS
works per month. PSs are dependent on primary care
staff for referrals, thus this measure of service delivery
reflects the extent to which a site has fully adopted the
PS role. The same model described for Reach will be
used for the analysis of adoption using total number of
contacts as the dependent variable. Analysis of the quali-
tative interviews, focusing on discussions of the PSs ’
level of integration into PACT, how they receive refer-
rals, and their relationships with PACT co-workers, will
add to our quantitative analysis of Adoption.
Implementation will be operationalized as the six
scores from the Peer Fidelity Measure: Peer services
(PS-rated, supervisor-rated, and Veteran-rated) and Im-
plementation factors (PS-rated, supervisor-rated, and
Veteran-rated). A separate analysis will be performed for
each of the six dependent measures at each timepoint. A
general linear mixed model will be used to compare the
two intervention condition of each dependent measure.
For the PS-rated and Veteran-rated outcomes, site will
be included as a random effect. Information learned
from the qualitative interviews will be used to triangu-
late the data from the quantitative measures of Imple-
mentation. Specifically, information regarding the
context, the role of the PS in PACT, and what the PS
adds to PACT services will be analyzed.
Hypothesis 2
Veterans served by [CONTACT_873150], activation, and functioning (Effectiveness)
than Veterans served by [CONTACT_873151]-
tation group.
The data for hypothesis 2 will be analyzed with a com-
parison of Veterans ’mean scores (satisfaction, activation,
and functioning) using a mixed effects model with ran-
dom intercept and slope (standard growth curve model)
and interaction term between evaluation condition and
time. Veteran demographic covariates (age, gender, race/
ethnicity, service connection, and ICD9 diagnosis codes)
will be included in the mixed effect models to control
for differential outcomes and to identify significantChinman et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:[ADDRESS_1219591] of various aspects of PS ser-
vice delivery (ORC and TDM scores, absolute value of
services delivered, rate of services delivered, caseload
size, etc.) on the patient outcomes of satisfaction, activa-
tion, and functioning. Across outcomes, we estimate we
will have greater than 89% power to detect a small effect
(d= .3) between intervention groups at 1 year, with
intracluster correlation = .025, an alpha level = .05 (two-
tailed), and controlling for baseline. We estimate that
each PS will see at least 14 Veterans per month for 84
Veterans per PS. Assuming a conservative 50% attrition
at 1 year and 70% at [ADDRESS_1219592] 83%
power at year [ADDRESS_1219593].
Hypothesis 3
In the second year (1 year after the end of facilitation),
the facilitated implementation group will continue to
demonstrate superior Maintenance (performance on
measures of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation). The
analyses for Reach, Adoption, and Implementation con-
ducted after [ADDRESS_1219594]
on 2/24/2016. This determination was made after two
actions. First, on 12/3/2015, the PIs (MC, RG) com-
pleted a non-research determination checklist that asked
several questions about the nature of the project (e.g.,
yield generalizable knowledge, expanding knowledge
base, double-blind or placebo design). All answers indi-
cated the project was not a research study. We sent the
completed checklist to the VA ’s Chief Consultant of
Mental Health Services to obtain final approval. In
addition, we obtained approval on 3/10/2016 from
Organizational Assessment Sub-Committee (OASC) of
the Office of Research Development, which governs the
surveying of VA staff (peer specialists are VA staff).
Site recruitment began in August 2015 and is ongoing.
Cohort 1 ( n= 8) sites were paired and randomized in
December 2015. Official start date for cohort [ADDRESS_1219595] in a
disclosure statement that had the basic elements of an
informed consent. Cohort 2 ( n= 10) was randomized
and officially began on July 2016. Because staff resources
were not sufficient to provide facilitated implementation
to five sites, after the initial matching of sites, one pair
was randomly chosen and removed from the groupassignment procedure, with both sites in that pair re-
ceiving standard implementation. The remaining four
pairs were randomized, resulting in cohort 2 ( n= 6) and
facilitated implementation ( n= 4) groups. Cohort 3 is
scheduled to start in March –April of 2017.
Discussion
As noted above, research evidence and passive dissemin-
ation strategies often do not change clinical practice or
increase the adoption of new practices. PS services has
some demonstrated evidence, yet has not been widely
adopted among VHA PACT. This project intends to test
whether a comprehensive implementation strategy —i-
PARIHS based facilitation tailored to PS deployment —
can aid in PS implementation in PACT, and secondarily
to evaluate the effectiveness of PS services on Veteran
activation, satisfaction, and functioning. Further, this
project will yield important lessons about how and
under what conditions facilitation aids PS implementa-
tion. The test will be challenging as PACT are under sig-
nificant pressure to serve a large number of Veterans.
However, the PACT randomized to receive facilitation will
have a number of additional supports to assist with the
implementation of PS services. If successful, this type of
facilitation could be used across a larger number of PACT
as VHA considers expanding the deployment of PSs in
primary care. In addition, study results will continue to
evaluate the efficacy of PS for the helpi[INVESTIGATOR_873125]-

This project is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with
number [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (URL:https://clinicaltrials.gov/

EFFICACY OF SIMUFILAM 100 MG TABLETS IN SUBJECTS WITH MILD -TO-MODERATE 
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE  
 
The purpose of this memo for  Protocol PTI-125-07, Version 3.0, February 15, 2023 , is to 
clarify  the requirement of reporting S erious Adverse Events (S AEs) to an Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)  or Ethics Committee (EC) .  
 
Regarding the protocol text  below, the  original  intent was for this to refer only to SAEs /AEs  
for which the relevant authorities  require reporting.  
 
Protocol section 10.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 “SAEs must be immediately reported to the responsible IRB ” (Section 10.5 was 
intended to refer only to SAEs for which the relevant authorities  require 
reporting) . 
 
Protocol section 13.5.[ADDRESS_171207]  
 “The Investigator is responsible for:  
o Notifying the IRB within 15 calendar days of all SAEs and unexpected 
AEs related to study medications .”  (Section 13.5.1 was intended to 
refer only to SAEs /AEs  for which the relevant authorities  require 
reporting) . 
  
Sites are to follow their IRB/EC requirements for reporting SAEs/AEs. For sites that utilize 
the central  WCG  IRB, they have provided the following reporting guidance:   
 
WCG IR B Guide for Researchers, Rev 1. 21:  
“Please note, only adverse events or IND safety  report s that prompt a change to 
the protocol or consent document are required to be reported to the IRB. ” 
 
The WCG IRB based their guidance on the most current FDA recommendations  which 
state the following:  
 CASSA VA 
sciences Page [ADDRESS_171208], Bldg. 1, Suite 300, Austin, TX  [ZIP_CODE]  
Phone:  512 -501-2444  Fax:  [PHONE_3315]  Page 2 of 2 
 
 
 
“In general, an AE observed during the conduct of a study should be considered 
an unanticipated problem involving risk to human subjects, and reported to the 
IRB, only if it were unexpected, serious, and would have implications for the 
conduct of the study ”.  
 
FDA then described “implications ” as significant changes to the protocol, monitoring 
requirements, informed consent,  or Investigator ’s Brochure.  
    
SAEs that do not meet the definition as described above  are not required to be 
immediately reported  to the study Central IRB, WCG. For those SAEs that do require 
reporting, WCG IRB has provided the following reporting guidance:  
 
“Promptly r eportable information should be submitted within five (5) days of 
becoming aware of the event .” 
 
If your site utilizes a local IRB /EC, and/or has site SOPs regarding the reporting of SAEs  to 
the IRB/EC  and/or other relevant authorities , please follow the relevant guidance.  
 
Please remember:  
 
All SAEs , regardless of IRB reportable status, are to be reported via email to Premier 
Pharmacovigilance  within 24 hours of learning of the event , consistent with the protocol .  
 
Protocol section 10.5, Serious Adverse Event Reporting:    
“All SAEs  must  be reported  immediately  (within  24 hours  of learning  of the 
event)  by e-mail to: 
Premier Research Global Pharmacovigilance  
”

 SUMMARY OF PROTOCOL AMENDMENT #1  
(New text is underlined; omitted text is struck through)  
 
Title page: Address is updated 
 
2.[ADDRESS_171213] sentence of the following was omitted:  “A second 6 -month repe
 at dose oral toxicity study in rats determined the 6-month NOAEL in 
the rat to be < 125 mg/kg/day, based on hepatocellular vacuolation in both sexes and hepatocellular hypertrophy in females at 125 and 250 mg/kg. We are evaluating whether these 
liver effects are rat specific. ” 
 2.[ADDRESS_171214] size notation was removed from the figure, and the following clarification was added: 
 Subjects who showed no detectable simufilam in plasma or >25% noncompliance by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_148930] (5 subjects). For the sensitivity analysis for epi[INVESTIGATOR_6368], the most and least impaired subjects were removed by [CONTACT_148978]. This sensitivity 
analysis removed subjects who performed so poorly they may not have understood the task and 
those who were at a ceiling of very few errors at baseline.  
 4. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN   Changed:  All subje
 cts will undergo MRI during screening to ensure entry criteria are met 
Changed t o: Subjects will undergo MRI during screening to ensure entry criteria are met 
(unless recent MRI confirms entry criteria)  
 Clarified that ECGs are resting  EC
 Gs, and Study Day 1 is Baseline. 
  5.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA

weeks prior to Study Day 1 (randomization) or had an unambiguous COVID-19 infection 
diagnosed more than 3 months before the start of the screening period (to minimize or 
eliminate any effect on cognition that might confound a proper assessment during screening ). 
(Note – subjects hav ing a symptomatic COVID -19 infection [or its variants] within [ADDRESS_171216] their screening assessment delayed; vaccinated, asymptomatic 
subjects that test positive for COVID -19 within three months of the screening period require 
Medical Monitor approval to not delay screening). 
5.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
#2. Clarified that pacemakers are excluded only if not “MRI friendly” 
 
#3. Clarified  that upper exclusion for BMI is > 37.5, not 35.0. 
 #6. Changed as follows : Geriatric Depression Scale (15 -item) score > 8.  (Note – a subject 
with a score > 8 may continue in screening if, in the judgment of the Investigator, the elevated 
score is not attributed to a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) . 
#9. Clarified as follows: MRI presence of cerebral vascular pathology (including, but not Page 7 of 141

Changed to:  (Note – a space-occupying lesion de emed clinically insignificant by [CONTACT_148980]). 
#16. Added cancer exclusion:  stage 0 melanoma in situ , 
  Added:  Other potential exceptions must be discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
#21. Add ed: Subjects with borderline hypothyroidism may be considered for rescreening after 
consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
#24. Clarified as follows : Clinically  History of or current clinically significant cardiac 
arrhythmia or heart block as evidenced by [CONTACT_148981]. 
#25. Added: (Note: borderline elevations in QTcF intervals due to bundle branch block must be 
approved by [CONTACT_1689]) 
#26. Changed as follows : The systolic BP for insufficiently controlled hypertension is now 
defined, at rest , as > 170 mmHg, not 160 mm Hg. 
#30. Added memantine : Discontinued AChEI or memantine  < 12 weeks prior to

#32. Changed as follows : Antipsychotics (Note – low doses are allowed only if given for sleep 
disturbances, agitation, aggression or dementia-related psychosis, and only if the dose has been 
stable for at least 12 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit ( Study Day 1) 4 weeks prior to 
screening ). 
#33. Added SSRIs and clarified as follows : Tricyclic or SSRI  antidepressants  and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors if prescribed for depression less than within 4 weeks prior to 
screening; or the Investigator believes the dose of such medication must be modified during the 
Screening Period; or the Investigator believes the subject must be started on such medication 
during the Screening Period. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are not permitted. ; all other 
antidepressants are allowed only if the dose has been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to 
screening.  
#35. Added clarification : Use of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_148934]

 indications other than seizures). 
#36. Added clarification : Chronic intake of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-containing analgesics at standard doses 
(use of intermittent or low -dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_148936]). 
#37. Added clarification : Use of prescribed sedating H1 antihistamines (Note – fexofenadine 
is the preferred non-sedating antihistamine for subjects requiring such medication). 
#40. Removed  (re: COVID) and vaccination/exposure requirements added to inclusion criteria. 
Final (now #42)  added example to other : Any other medical or neurological condition (other 
than Alzheimer’s disease), that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], might represent a 
contributing cause to the subject’s cognitive impairment, or affect cognitive assessment, subject safety, ability to comply with study assessments, drug compliance and completion of the study. This could include, f or example, excessive marijuana or cannabinoid use. 
 6.1.2 Storage  
Added: The Pharmacy Manual should be referenced for additional information about handling 
temperature excursions and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_29356] . 
 
6.3 CONCOMITTANT MEDICATIONS  
Clarified  that “medications” are prescription  medic ations for conditions other than AD. 
Added:  Chronic prescription medications for conditions other than AD must be stable for at least [ADDRESS_171218] on 
cognitive testing may be modified during the Screening Period if necessary, but the 
Investigator may wish to confer with the Medical Monitor in such a situation. After 
randomization to Study Drug at the Baseline Visit (Study Day 1), the Investigator should strive 
to maintain concomitant medications at currently prescribed doses whenever possible. Dose 
modification, addition or discontinuation of medications that might have a potential 
confounding effect on cognitive testing (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors and mem antine) after 
randomization should be reviewed by [CONTACT_1689]. 
7.1.1 Screening visit Period (No greater than a 60-day duration prior to Study Day 1)  
Changed:  Education demographic information collected changed from years to level  of 
education. Changed “in the 4 weeks prior to screening” to “recently” as follows : 
• Review concomitant medications and any recently  discontinued medications , in 
the 4 weeks prior to s creening  Page 9 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI-125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125) FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, 2023  
Page 7 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 Clarification  in eCOA order of administration at screening as follows: 
o Note:  it is a study requirement to first administer the MMSE (and then the 
other assessments if the MMSE criterion is met)  
 MMSE  
 CDR (study partner is interviewed first in the  absenc e of the study 
subject and then the subject is interviewed, by [CONTACT_116207], in the 
absence of the study partner) 
Clarified  that ECG is resting  ECG.  
Added “or P -tau217” to lab assessments and clarified  capture requirement of unexpected 
results:  
• Laboratory assessments, including: routine serum chemistry, TSH, free T4, 
Vitamin B12 levels, HBsAg, HCV -Ab, hematology, urinalysis and urine screen 
for drugs of abuse. Plasma for P -tau181 or P-tau217 assessment will also be 
collected unless there is documen ted evidence of AD pathophysiology prior to 
screening. For subjects with diabetes, collect a blood sample for HbA1C. 
Unexpected, abnormal laboratory results observed during the Screening Period 
should be captured as Medical History and not as an AE (see Section 10.1 – 
Adverse Events – Definition). 
Clarified  that amphetamines for psychiatric symptoms acceptable if stable as follows: 
o Note – ampheta mines, prescribed to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms 
associated with progressive AD, are acceptable if prescribed for at least 12 
weeks prior to the Baseline Visit (Study Day 1); the Investigator should 
document in the subject’s file the rationale and timeframe for such use, noting 
that the expected positive drug screen for amphetamine does not reflect abuse 
of such drug. 
Clarified that previous MRI results need to be approved by [CONTACT_148982] 1. 
o Note: previous brain MRI results, with appropriate documentation and 
approved by [CONTACT_1689] , will be accepted for up to 6 months prior 
to the Baseline Visit (Study Day 1) unless a recent clinical event warrants a 
repeat scan.  
Added:  
• To remain in the study, subjects who develop COVID- 19 (or  its variants) or manifest a 
positive COVID-[ADDRESS_171219] during the screening period will need approval from the 
Medical Monitor.

Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI-125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125) FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, [ADDRESS_171220]  
Deleted  “181” from p-tau181 to capture either p-tau181 or p-tau217.  
Added:  
• Clinical hypothyroidism (can rescreen 3 months after being placed on supplemental 
thyroid replacement and manifesting a normal [or low] TSH level and a normal free T4 
level)  
Clarified  as follows: Other reasons for screen failure will require Medical Monitor  approval to 
rescreen.  Subjects undergoing rescreen, who had an inclusionary P-tau elevation and/or an 
acceptable screening MRI, should utilize these results during the rescreening process and not 
repeat these procedures.   
7.1.3 Baseline  Visit (Study Day 1)  (Dosing Initiation)  
Clarified that Study Day 1 is Baseline Visit.  
Added to eCOA order of administration (also added to 7.1.4, 7.1.5 and 7.1.6) :  
• Note: it is acceptable to simultaneously administer the study partner assessments in 
parallel with subject assessments (separate, qualified raters in separate rooms). When 
admin istered in parallel, the eCOA order of administration should be maintained (ADAS -
cog12 and then C -SSRS for the subject; ADCS -ADL, NPI [INVESTIGATOR_148937]).  
Clarified  details of ECG (for 7.1.3, Baseline Visit only ): 
• A 12-lead resting  ECG (5- min supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; triplicate format ) 
Clarified  details of ECG in 7.1.4, 7.1.5 and 7.1.6 (all other Visits) : 
• A 12-lead resting  ECG (5- min supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) 
7.1.7 End-of- Study / Early Termination Safety  Follow- up 
Added:   This phone call will thus occur Week [ADDRESS_171221] should be followed and treated by [CONTACT_148983] (see Section 10.1 – Adverse Events).  
7.1.10 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_148938] s: Bodyweight l oss (compared to weight at Baseline Visit [Study Day 1]) of 
≥ 2 kg resulting in a BMI < 18.5 is an additional stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107160].

 7.2.1 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Added: or P -tau217 
Added: The plasma P -tau181 test is a validated assay using ADX antibodies, which shows a 
wide dynamic range and an AUC of 0.92 during validation without any algorithms. Validation 
of a P -tau217 assay is pending. 
 
7.2.3 Preparation of Plasma Biomarker and PK Samples from PET Sub- study Participants  
Changed as follows:  At each bl ood collection for biomarkers and PK, blood samples will be 
drawn into two Vacutainer® tubes (10 mL per tube) containing K2EDTA. The tubes will be 
placed immediately  on ice upon collection. Following the instructions within the Laboratory 
Manual, the plasma samples will be centrifuged, frozen (within 30 minutes of centrifuging), 
and shipped to the central laboratory. Within 30 min of collection, the blood will be centrifuged 
at approximately 1000 X G for 15 min, preferably 4-5°C. Within 30 min of centrifuging, 
plasma will be transferred to polypropylene tubes and stored at -70°C until shipped to the 
central lab (complete instructions as per lab manual).  
8.2 CLINICAL DEMENTIA RATING (CDR)  
Clarified as follows:  The stu dy partner is interviewed first by a qualified rater who assesses all 
six domains in the absence of the study subject. The subject is then interviewed by [CONTACT_148984]. caregiver.  
8.8 GERIAT RIC DEPRESSION SCALE (GDS)  
Added:  The GDS scale score should be clinically interpreted to evaluate the potential for a 
major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_148939] a clinician who has been trained on the scale and is familiar with 
the diagnosis of major depression. 
8.9 ELE CTRONIC CAPTURE OF RATING SCALES  
Added:  The electronic capture of the rating scales will include an audio recording for the 
purpose of monitoring site staff performance during scale questionnaire administration and 
providing constructive feedback to the raters.  Subject data captured on recordings will not be 
analyzed as part of the trial outcomes. The Investigator or rater will read the questions out loud 
to study participants who will then respond. The process of questions and answers will be 
recorded usi ng an audio-recording device.  These highly secured recordings will not be made 
public at any time and will be destroyed after the Study Drug has been either approved or 
disapproved for use by [CONTACT_148985]. 
9. EARLY DISCONTINUATION 
Clarified  that ECG is 12-lead r esting  and 5 min supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
 
10.1 ADVERSE EVENTS -- DEFINITION  
Changed:  Monitor ing for AEs will start after informed consent has been obtained . at dosing.  Page 12 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI-125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125) FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, 2023  
Page 10 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 Added:  Adverse events reported during the screening period or AEs secondary to study- related 
procedures should always be captured as not having a reasonable possibility the AE was caused 
by [CONTACT_81807]. Unexpected, abnormal laboratory results observed during the Screening 
Period should be captured as Medical History and not as an AE.  
10.3 ADVERSE EVENTS – RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY DRUG  
Changed as follows:  The relatio nship  of each AE to the Study Drug will be based on the 
Investigator’s assessment as to whether there is a reasonable possibility the AE 
was caused by [CONTACT_81807]. This assessment will be  based  on the Investigator's 
clinical  judgment, which  in turn depends on consideration of various factors  such as the 
subject's report,  the timing  of the  AE in relationship  to Study Drug 
administration/discontinuation,  the Investigator’s observations, and the Investigator’s prior 
experience.  The Investigator’s assessment of the relationship  of the AE to the Study Drug 
will be recorded  in the appropriate section  of the EDC.  The relationship of each AE to the 
study drug will be classified into one of three defined categories as follows:  
• Unlikely – a causal relationship between the AE and the study drug is unlikely.  
• Possible –  a causal relationship between the AE and the st udy drug is possible.  
• Probably –  a causal relationship between the AE and the study drug is probably. 
For example, the AE is a common adverse event known to occur with the 
pharmacological class of the study drug; or the AE abated on study drug 
discontinuation and reappeared upon rechallenge with the study drug.  
These three categories are based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment, which in turn depends 
on consideration of various factors such as the subject’s report, the timing of the AE in 
relationsh ip to study drug administration/discontinuation, the physician’s observations and the 
physician’s prior experience. The relationship of the AE to the study drug will be recorded in 
the appropriate section of the EDC.  
11.3.2  Secondary Analyses  
Clarified  that p -tau181 may be p-tau181 and/or p-tau217.

 2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. MECHANISM OF ACTION  
Cassava Sciences , Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_148943], a novel drug candidate designed to treat 
and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Simufilam binds with femtomolar 
affinity to an altered conformation of filamin A (FLNA)  that is induced by [CONTACT_148986] 1-
42 (Aβ42), present in AD brain and cri tical to the toxicity of A β42.1-3 Simufilam binding 
reverses th e altered FLNA conformation and restores FLNA’s native shape, preventing 
two toxic signaling cascades of A β42. Aβ42, in monomer or small oligomer form,  hijack s 
the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( α7nAChR) and signal s via this receptor to 
hyperphosphorylate tau. T his signaling requires the recruitment of altered FLNA to this 
receptor . In addition, altered FLNA also links to  toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to allow A β42 
to persist ently activate this receptor , leading to inflammatory cytokine release and 
neuroinflammation. Normal FLNA does not associate with either α7nAChR or TLR4. In 
addition to disrupting the normal functions of α7nAChR and tau protein, Aβ42’s toxic 
signaling to hyperphosphorylate tau leads to the signature [CONTACT_149035]. In two AD 
mouse models and in postmortem human AD brain tissue, simufilam restored function of 
three receptors that are impaired in AD: the α7nAChR, the N-methyl-D- aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR),  and the insulin receptor (IR).2,[ADDRESS_171229] simufilam both to improve 
cognition and to slow AD progression. Both mouse models used a dose of 20 mg/kg/day  
(equivalent to 60 mg/m2/day).  
2.2. SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY  
A robust nonclinical ADME, safety pharmacology, and general and genetic toxicology 
program has been conducted with simufilam. In vitro  metabolic profiling showed minimal 
metabolism across several species including humans. Simufilam was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_148944] 100% oral bioavailability, a 2.67-h 
half-life in dog, dose-proportional PK and no accumulation. Simufilam does not inhibit or 
induce major CYP450 enzymes, nor is a substrate or inhibitor of major human drug transporters at clinically relevant concentrations . Safety pharmacology studies showed no 
adverse effects on gross behavioral and physiologica l parameters in the Irwin test of CNS 
toxicity in rats, no adverse effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume or minute volume in the rat respi[INVESTIGATOR_148945], and no adverse effects on arterial blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters in the dog cardiovascular study. The in vitro  hERG test for cardiotoxicity also 
indicated no adverse effect. A full battery of genotoxicity studies was conducted ( in vitro  
bacterial Ames, in vitro  chromosomal aberration, and in vivo  rat micronucleus test) and all Page 19 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125)  FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, 2023 
 
Page 17 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 were negative. An in vitro  specificity screen showed no significant activation or inhibition 
of a panel of 68 receptors, channels and transporters. 
Simufilam was tested  in single dose and repeat dose oral toxicity studies of up to 6 months 
in rats and 9 months in dogs. A 6-month repeat dose oral toxicity study in rat s (PTI-125-
NC-049) used the same doses as a 28- day study (50, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day), which 
found 500 mg/kg/day to be the no-adverse- effect -level (NOAEL) . In the 6 -month study, 
the toxicological response was characterized by [CONTACT_148987] 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day  animals, 
including increased hepatic weight, hepatocellular hypertrophy and vacuolation, 
single/multiple basophilic/ eosinophilic/clear cell focus, hepatocellular degeneration, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and oval cell hyperplasia. The presence of bile pi[INVESTIGATOR_148946]. These findings correlated with changes to the clinical chemistry profile, 
including increased ALP and total/direct bilirubin. Over the 1- month recovery period, there 
was complete recovery of the hepatocellular degeneration and partial recovery of 
hepatocellular hypertrophy; other microscopic findings in the liver remained. The NOAEL 
in this 6 -month study was 50 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 300 mg/m2), corresponding to a 
safet y margin of 6- and 1.6- fold based on C max and AUC over the 100 mg b.i.d. dose in 
human subjects. A second 6 -month repeat dose oral toxicity study in rats determine d the 
6-month NOAEL in the rat to be < 125 mg/kg/day, based on hepatocellular vacuolation in 
both sexes and hepatocellular hypertrophy in females at 125 and 250 mg/kg.  
In a 9 -month toxicity study in dogs (PTI -125- NC-050) , the no- effect -level (NOE L) of 
simufilam was 25 mg/kg. The high dose of 200 mg/kg/day  was decreased to 150 mg/kg/day 
after 1 month due to bodyweight loss considered unsustainable for 9 months . Clinical signs 
were slight hypoactivity and incidences of slight muscle fasciculations  early in the study, 
and salivation. There were no pathology findings, but the high dose was considered adverse 
due to two unexplained deaths. The 75 mg/kg/day NOAEL (equivalent to 1500 mg/m2) 
provides 38- and 19- fold safety margins based on  Cmax and AUC  over the [ADDRESS_171230] -in-human, double-blind, single ascending dose clinical study (PTI -125-01) was 
conducted in healthy normal volunteers, age 18- 45 with oral dosing solution. Doses were 
placebo, 50, 100 and 200 mg (equivalent to 31, 62, and 123 mg/m2, respectively)  
administered to three different groups of volunteers . The study showed dose proportional 
PK, a half -life ranging from 4.5 to 6 h, and there were no drug- related  adverse events  (AEs). Page 20 of 141

 In a 28-day phase 2a study (PTI-125-03) , 13 subjects with mild-to-modera te AD receiv ed 
simufilam 100 mg b.i.d. as oral tablets. Subjects  had Mini- Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) 
scores  ≥ 16 and ≤ 24, and were age 50 -85 with a CSF total tau/Aβ 42 ratio ≥ 0.30. A second 
CSF sample was collected on Day 28 , allowing assessment of change from baseline in 
biomarkers using commercial ELISA kits.  All 8 biomarkers that are elevated in AD were 
significantly reduced  from baseline  (Figure 1).[ADDRESS_171231] reduction in 
phospho- tau (P-Tau181) confirms  the mechanism of action of simufila m. Simufilam was 
safe and well tolerated in all subject s.

A phase 2b  randomized , placebo -controlled clinical study (PTI-125-02) of simufilam 50 or 
100 mg tablets or placebo (1:1:1)  enrolled [ADDRESS_171232]  were measured in triplicate 
in the same ELISA plates. Albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured by 
[CONTACT_148988]. Plasma p -tau181, measured 
by [CONTACT_148989], was significantly reduced versus placebo. The treatment effect on plasma p -tau181 was consistent with treatment effects in 
CSF biomarkers, suggesting disease modification and replicat ing Phase 2a results in a well-
controlled study. An open- label safety study of simufilam 100 mg showed larger 
improvements from baseline at 6 months (n=25) ( Figure 2).

The secondary endpoints in the Phase 2b study were two cognitive measures using the 
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Subject s were assessed on the 
Paired Associate Learning (PAL) test, measuring epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], and a test of spatial 
working memory. The primary outcome measure  for each was total errors, with errors 
imputed for more difficult levels not reached in the PAL test. Simufilam produced 
encouraging mean improvements from baseline in spatial working memory and in a 
sensitivity analysis for epi[INVESTIGATOR_148947], suggesting cognitive enhancement (Figure 3). Without the sensitivity analysis, the PAL test did not show a clear treatment 
effect. Subjects who showed no detectable simufilam in plasma or >25% noncompliance 
by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_148948] (5 subjects). For the sensitivity analysis 
for epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], the most and least impaired subjects were removed by [CONTACT_148978]. 
This sensitivity analysis removed subjects who performed so poorly they may not have understood the t ask and those who were at a ceiling of very few errors at baseline.

4. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN 
In this Phase 3 clinical study, approximately 750 subjects with mild -to-moderate AD wil l 
receive placebo  or 100 mg tablets of simufilam, twice daily, for 52 weeks . Randomization 
(1:1) will be stratified by [CONTACT_148991] (16-20 and 21-27).  
 
Subject s, 50- 87 years of age,  will be selected for screening based on a diagnosi s of AD 
consistent with Stages 4 or 5 on the Alzheimer’s continuum (N ational Institute on Aging – 
Alzheimer’s Association [ZIP_CODE]). Subjects must have MMSE ≥ 16 and ≤ 27, and a Clinical 
Dementia Rating Global Score (CDR -GS) of 0.5, [ADDRESS_171236] 
confirmed PET or fluid biomarker evidence of AD pathophysiology prior to randomization  
(see Section 5.2 – Inclusion Criteria for details) .

research clinic will occur on Study Day  1 and at Weeks 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52.   
 The co -primary endpoints include the 12 -item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – 
Cognitive Subscale (ADAS -Cog12) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – 
Activities of Daily Living (ADCS -ADL), both assessed as the change from baseline to the 
end of the double- blind treatment perio d (Week 52).  
 Secondary endpoint s include the integrated Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes 
(CDR -SB). A  brief questionnaire assessing caregiver burden, the Zarit Burden Interview 
(ZBI), will be collected as an additional secondary endpoint.  
 Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_148992], vital signs, clinical labs, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) at every visit. Subjects will undergo 
MRI  during screening to ensure entry criteria are met  (unless recent MRI confirms entry 
criteria) . Resting ECGs will be conducted at Baseline (Study Day 1 ) and Weeks 4, 28 and 
52. A  complete physical and neurological examination will be performed at screening , and 
brief examinations will be performed at all other visits. Weight will be measured during 
the Screening Period , at Baseline ( Study Day 1) and at all other visits.  
 A limited number of research sites will be invited to participate in  the PK and plasma 
biomarker sub -study. Collection of PK samples will enable an exposure -response analysis.  
Approximately 100 subjects will participate (50 per group). P lasma samples will be 
collected during the Screening Visit and again at Weeks [ADDRESS_171238] (DSMB) will meet periodically to review 
subject  safety assessments  and determine if dosing may c ontinue. A charter will be 
developed with specific guidance for the DSMB.

include, for example, excessive marijuana or cannabi noid use.  
6. STUDY DRUG  
6.1. SIMUFILAM  PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND PREPARATION  
Investigational simufilam (100 milligram active strength) and matching placebo will 
be supplied by C assava as coated tablets .   
All remaining  unused S tudy D rug will be returned to the Sponsor or designee.  
6.1.1. Packaging and Labelling 
Simufilam or placebo tablets in plastic bottles will be supplied in 70- count bottles  for 
a 4-week supply or 188-count bottles for a 12-week supply. B ottles include a desiccant 
canister and are closed with a foil  seal and child -resistant (CR) cap. Each bottle contains 
7 or 10 days of extra medication to accommodate scheduling flexibility with clinic 
visits.

Simufilam (PTI -125)  FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, 2023 
 
Page 28 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 A Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS ®) that is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant 
will be used to track adher ence to the b.i.d. dosing schedule . MEMS ® caps will be 
supplied to replace the conventional CR cap on each bottle. One (1) MEMS ® cap will 
be assigned to each subject for use throughout the study. Each MEMS ® cap has an LCD 
display that provides immediate visual indication of the number of doses taken that day 
and the number of hours since the prior dose that day, resetting to zero each night. 
Instruction s on management and use of MEMS ® caps will be provided i n the Pharmacy 
manual and during site training. 
 
Each bottle is labeled with a  unique double -blind ID number that is randomly assigned 
to a treatment. A computer -based clinical study management system will specif y the 
bottle  ID number to be dispensed according to the subject’s treatment randomization. 
 
6.1.2. Storage 
The investigational drug supplies must be stored in a locked cabinet or room with 
limited access at controlled room temperature, 20-25º C (68-77º F) and protected from 
moisture.  The Pharmacy Manual should be referenced for additional information about 
handling temperature excursions and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_29356] . 
6.1.3. Drug Accountability 
The Investigator will be responsible for monitoring the receipt,  storage,  dispensing 
and accounting of all study medications  according  to site standard operating 
procedures ( SOPs ). All records documenting the chain of custody for the study 
medication  must be retained  in the site study file. Accurate,  original site records  
must be maintained  of drug inventory and dispensing. All  records  must be made  
available to the S ponsor (or designee)  and appropriate  regulatory agencies  upon 
request.  
6.2. ADMINISTRATION AND DOSING REGIMEN  
Subject s will be randomized to receive  placebo  or 100 mg simufilam twice daily 
(b.i.d.).  Study Drug can be taken with or without food.  
6.3. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Use of prescription or non- prescription medications will be recorded  during the study.  
Chronic prescription medications for conditions other than AD must be stable for at least [ADDRESS_171246] on cognitive testing may be modified during the Screening Period, Page 31 of 141

 if necessary, but the Investigator may wish to confer with the Medical Monitor in such 
a situation. After randomization to Study Drug at the Baseline Visit  (Study Day 1) , the 
Investigator should strive to maintain concomitant medications at currently prescribed 
doses whenever possible. Dose modification, addition or discontinuation of medications that might have a potential confounding effect on cognitive testing (e.g., 
cholinesterase inhibitors  and memantine) after randomization  should be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_1689]. [Note – see Inclusion Criterion #12 and Exclusion Criteri a #29 
and #30 for additional details regarding background medications frequently prescribed to patients with AD].   
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Appendix A pr esents the Schedule of Activities. 
Prior to  any study- related  activities,  the Informed  Consent Form  (ICF)  must be signed 
and dated  by [CONTACT_148998]  (or a legal ly authorized representative) and  the study partner.  
The format  and content of the ICF must be agreed  upon by [CONTACT_11097](s),  the appropriate IRB and the Sponsor. The signed and dated  ICF must 
be retained by  [CONTACT_148999]'s file. 
 
7.1. EVALUATIONS BY [CONTACT_149000]-up visits can be scheduled +/- five (5) days from the  targeted Study Visit date.   
 
7.1.1. Screening  Period  (No greater  than a 60-day duration prior to Study Day 1 ) 
The Sponsor recognizes the Screening Period assessments and procedures may not 
necessarily be completed in a single visit. A subject is permitted to be screened over more than one calendar day if, in the Investigator’s judgment, such scheduling will 
optimize the accuracy of Screening Period assessments and procedures.   The following 
will be completed during the Screening Period: 
• Informed  Consent.  
• Review  of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
• Collect d emographic information ( e.g., sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity, level 
of education)  
• Medical and surgical  history  
• Review  concomitant medications  and any recently discontinued medications. 
• To the extent such information is available, review and record any 
investigational drugs administered during past clinical study participation regardless of the date of such participation.  Page 32 of 141

the other assessments if the MMSE criterion is met)  
• MMSE  
• CDR (study partner is interviewed first in the absence of 
the study subject and then the subject is interviewed, by 
[CONTACT_116207], in the absence of the study partner)  
• Geriatric Depression Scale 
• C-SSRS – B aseline/screening version

• Laboratory assessments,  including routine s erum  chemistry,  TSH , free T4, 
Vitamin B12 levels, HBsAg, HCV -Ab, hematology, urinalysis and urine  screen  
for drug s of abuse. Plasma for P-tau181 or P-tau217 assessment will also be 
collected unless there is documented evidence of AD pathophysiology prior to 
screening.  For subjects with diabetes, collect a blood sample for HbA1C. 
Unexpected, abnormal laboratory results observed during the Screening Period 
should be captured as Medical History and not as an AE (see Section 10.1 – 
Adverse Events – Definition). 
o Note – amphetam ines, prescribed to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms 
associated with progressive AD, are acceptable if prescribed for at least 12 weeks prior  to the Baseline Visit (Study Day 1); the Investigator should 
document in the subject’s file the rationale and timeframe for such use, 
noting that the expected positive drug screen for amphetamine does not 
reflect abuse of such drug. 
• Once the clinical and laboratory assessments above have been completed  and 
verified to be consistent with study participation , schedule brain MRI to 
confirm subject meets MRI -specific entry criteria . 
o Note – previous brain MRI results, with appropriate documentation and 
approved by [CONTACT_1689] , will be accepted for up to 6 months prior 
to the Baseline Visit ( Study Day 1) unless a recent clinical event warrants a 
repeat scan . Page 33 of 141

To remain in the study, subjects who develop COVID -19 (or its variants) or manifest a 
positive COVID -[ADDRESS_171247] given informed consent and fail to meet the Inclusion and/or 
Exclusion criteria (screen failure) may not be rescreened if the screen failure is due to 
non-eligible  MMSE ( <16), MRI or P-tau results.  If screen failure occurs for the 
following reasons , then the subject is allowed one rescreen :  
• Low vitamin B12 requiring supplemental therapy (can retest after 4 weeks)  
• MMSE of 28 (can rescreen after 8 weeks)  
• Clinical hypothyroidism (can rescreen 3 months after being placed on 
supplemental thyroid replacement and manifesting a normal [or low] TSH level and a normal free T4 level)  
Other reasons for screen failure will require Medical Monitor approval to rescreen.  
Subjects undergoing rescreen, who had an inclusionary P -tau elevation and/or an 
acceptable screening MRI, should utilize these results during the rescreening proces s 
and not repeat these procedures.   
7.1.3. Baselin e Visit ( Study 
Day 1) (Dosing I nitiation)

subject  from Study D rug, the Sponsor will be notified immediately. The subject should 
be followed and treated by [CONTACT_149001] (see 
Section 10.1 – Adverse Events).  Restarting the subject on Study D rug will be a mutual 
decision by [CONTACT_2725]. See also Section 9.0 – Early 
Discontinuation.

7.2. LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS  
7.2.1. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed during the S creening Period , 
Baseline ( Study Day 1 ) pre-dose, and at  all follow-up visits: 
 
• Hematology:  white  blood cell (WBC)  count with differential,  red blood cell 
(RBC)  count, hemoglobin, hematocrit,  platelet  count. 
• Serum  Chemistry:  glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate,  calcium,  
phosphate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),  total bilirubin, creatinine,   albumin , 
globulin, total protein, uric acid,  alkaline  phosphatase (ALP), alanine  
transaminase (ALT),  aspartate transaminase  (AST),  gamma  glutamyl 
transpeptidase (GGT),  lactose  dehydrogenase (LDH) . 
• Urinalysis: color, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose , ketones, occult  blood, 
nitrites  and leukocyte esterase.   A “reflex” microscopic examination  will be 
performed  if protein, occult blood, nitrites  or leukocyte esterase is present  on the 
basic analysis . 
• Screening Period :  During the Screening Period only, bloods will be drawn for TSH, 
free T4, Vitamin B 12, HepBsAg, HCV -Ab, HbA1C (diabetic  subject s only) and 
plasma P-tau181 or P-tau217 (Note – plasma collection for P-tau181 or P-tau217 
not required if subject has documented evidence of AD pathophysiology prior to 
screening). The plasma P -tau181 test is a validated assay using ADX antibodies, 
which shows a wide dynamic range and an AUC of 0.92 during validation without 
any algorithms. Validation of a P -tau217 assay is pending. Urine to screen  for drugs 
of abuse  (amphetamines, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_148955]) will also be 
collected during the Screening Period .

 7.2.3. Preparation of Samples  from PK and Plasma Biomarker Sub -study Participants  
At each blood collection for PK and biomarkers, blood samples will be drawn into a 
Vacutainer® tube (10 mL per tube) containing K2EDTA. The tubes will be placed 
immediately on ice upon collection. Following the instructions within the Laboratory Manual, the plasma samples will be centrifuged , frozen (within 30 minutes of 
centrifuging), and shipped to the central laboratory.  
8. COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENTS  
8.1. M
INI-MENTAL STATE EXAM (MMSE)  
The M MSE6 is a set of standardized questions covering several  target areas: orientation, 
registration, attention and calculation, short -term verbal recall, naming, repetition, 3-
step command, reading, writing, and visuospatial cognitive assessment. Administration 
of the MMSE is estimated to take approximately 10 minutes . 
8.2. CLINICAL DEMENTIA RATING (CDR)  
Washington University’s CDR7 characterizes six domains of cognitive and functional 
performance applicable to AD and related dementias: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The 
study partner  is interviewed first by a qualified rater who assesses all six domains  in 
the absence of the s tudy subject . The subject is then interviewed by [CONTACT_149002] . A CDR  global score can be calculated by [CONTACT_149003]’s online algorithm 
(https://biostat.wustl.edu/~adrc/cdrpgm/index.html) where 0 = no dementia , and scores 
of 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 = questionable, mild, moderate, or severe dementia, respectively.  The 
sum of boxes (i.e., CDR -SB)[ADDRESS_171260]- GS in  patients with mild dementia.   
8.3. ALZHEIMER ’S DISEASE ASSESSMENT SCALE – COGNITI VE SUBSCALE 12 (ADAS -
COG12) 
The ADAS -Cog9,10 is a psychometrician -administered battery comprised of several 
cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and 
spontaneous speech. The ADAS -Cog12 (which includes Delayed Word Recall) will be 
administered to all subjects  at various key visits throughout the study.

Agitation/aggression, Dysphoria/depression, Anxiety, Irritability, Disinhibition, 
Euphoria, Apathy, Aberrant motor behavior, Sleep, and nighttime  behavior change, 
Appetite and eating change). The study partner  is then asked to rate their own  distress 
for the subject’s behavioral symptoms occurring in the past 4 weeks.  
8.5. ALZHEIMER ’S DISEASE COOPERATIVE STUDY – ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING 
(ADCS -ADL -AD) 
The ADCS -ADL12 is a 23 -item study partner  questionnaire that covers both basic 
activities of daily living (ADL) (e.g., eating and toileting) and more complex ADL or 
instrumental ADL (e.g., using the telephone, managing finances, preparing a meal).  
8.6. COLUMBIA -SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE (C-SSRS)  
The C -SSRS13 is an assessment tool used to assess the  lifetime suicidality of a subject

 10. ADVERSE EVENTS/SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1. ADVERSE  EVENTS  - DEFINITION  
An Adverse E vent (AE) is any undesirable event  that occurs  to a subject  during a  study, 
whether  or not that event is considered  related to Study Drug. Monitoring for AEs will 
start after informed consent has been obtained. Examples  include: 
• Any treatment -emergent  signs and symptoms (events  that are marked  by a change 
from  the subject's baseline/entry  status  [e.g., an increase in severity  or frequency  of 
pre-existing  abnormality  or disorder])  
• All reactions  from  Study D rug, an overdose, abuse of drug, withdrawal  phenomena,  
sensitivity  or toxicity  to Study D rug 
• Apparently unrelated  illnesses  
• Injury or accidents  (Note:  if a medical  condition is known to have caused  the injury 
or accident,  the medical  condition and the accident  should be reported  as two separate 
medical events  [e.g., for a fall secondary to dizziness,  both "dizziness"  and "fall" 
should be recorded  separately])  
• Extensions or exacerbations  of symptoms, subjective subject -reported  events, new 
clinically  significant abnormalities  in clinical  laboratory, physiological testing  or 
physical examination  
 
All AEs,  whether  or not related  to Study Drug, must be fully  document ed on  the AE 
page of the CRF  and in the subject's clini cal chart.  Adverse events reported during the 
screening period or AEs secondary to study-related procedures should always be captured 
as not having a reasonable possibility the AE was caused by [CONTACT_81807]. Unexpected, abnormal laboratory results observed during the Screening Period should be captured as Medical History and not as an AE. 
In the event  that a subject  is withdrawn  from  the study because  of an AE, it must be 
recorded  on the CRF  as such. The subject  should be followed and treated  by [CONTACT_149007].  
The Investigator must report  all directly  observed  AEs and all spontaneously reported  
AEs.  The Investigator will ask the subject  a non- specific question (e.g., "Have you 
noticed  anything different  since your dose of the study medication?")  to assess whether 
any AEs have been  experienced  since the last assessment.  AEs will be identified  and 
documented in the Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) system  in appropriate medical  
terminology. The severity  and the relationship  to the Study Drug will be determined  
and reported  in EDC  (see below).  Page 44 of 141

Simufilam (PTI -125)  FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, 2023 
 
Page 42 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 10.2. ADVERSE EVENTS - SEVERITY RATING  
The severity  of each AE should be characterized  and then classified  into one of three 
clearly  defined  categories  as follows: 
• Mild  – the AE does not interfere  in a significant manner  with the subject's  normal 
functioning level. It may be an  annoyance.  
• Mode rate – the AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazar dous 
to health. It  is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
• Severe – the AE produces significant  impairment  of functioning or incapacitation  
and is a definite  hazard  to the subject's health.  
These three categories  are based  on the Investigator's clinical  judgment, which  in turn 
depends on  consideration of various factors  such as the subject's report  and the physician's 
observations. The severity  of the AE should be recorded  in the appropriate section  of the 
EDC . 
10.3. ADVERS E EVENTS  – RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY   DRUG 
The relationship  of each AE to the Study Drug will be based on the Investigator’s 
assessment as to whether there is a reasonable possibility the AE was caused by [CONTACT_149008]. This assessment will be  based  on the Investigator’s clinical  judgment, which  in 
turn depends on consideration of various factors  such as the subject’s  report,  the timing  
of the  AE in relationship  to Study Drug administration/discontinuation,  the Investigator’s 
observations, and the Investigator’s prior experience.  The Investigator’s assessment of 
the relationship  of the AE to the Study Drug will be recorded  in the appropriate section  
of the EDC.  
10.4. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS - DEFINITIONS  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  includes (but is not limited  to) an experience occurring  
at any dose that results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life-threatening  event  (i.e., the subject  is at immediate  risk of death  from  the 
reaction  as it occurs).  "Life -threatening" does not include an event  that, had it 
occurred  in a more  serious  form,  might have caused  death. For example,  drug - 
induced hep
atitis  that resolved without evidence  of hepatic failure  would not be  
considered  life-threatening  even  though drug- induced  hepatitis  can be fatal.  
• In-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], not an emergency  room visit)  or 
prolongation of existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Page 45 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125)  FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, 2023 
 
Page 43 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 • A persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  (i.e., a substantial disruption of 
the subject's ability  to carry  out normal life functions). 
• A congenital  anomaly/birth defect . 
 
In addition, medical  and scientific  judgment should be exercised  in deciding whether  
other situations  should be considered  an SAE  (i.e., important medical  events  that may 
not be  immediately  life-threatening  or result  in death  but may jeopardize the subject  or 
may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes  listed  
in the definition  above). Examples  of such medical  events  include (but are not limited  
to): allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or 
the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
An unexpected  AE is one for which  the specificity  or severity  is not consistent with the 
current Investigator's  Brochure. For example,  hepatic  necrosis  would be unexpected  (by 
[CONTACT_14213])  if the Investigator's Brochure listed  only elevated  hepatic 
enzymes  or hepatitis.  
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by 
[CONTACT_149009])  if the Investigator's Brochure listed  only cerebral  vascular  
accidents.  
10.5.
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING  
The reporting of SAEs  by [CONTACT_149010]  (e.g., FDA)  is a 
regulatory requirement.  Each  regulatory agency  has established  a timetable  for 
reporting SAEs  based  upon  established  criteria.  Likewise,  it is the responsibility  of 
the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_148958].  
All SAEs  must be reported  immediately  (within  24 h ours  of learning  of the event)  
by e- mail to: 
Premier Research Global Pharmacovigilance  
 
 
Do not delay  reporting a suspected  SAE  to obtain additional information.  Any 
additional information, if collected,  can be reported  to the Sponsor as a follow-up to 
the initial report.  
SAEs  must be immediately reported  to the responsible IRB. 
In the case of a death  or other SAE  that has occurred  within  [ADDRESS_171264] also report such an event  within  24 hours 
of being notified. Your local  IRB may also require  these reports.  Page 46 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125)  FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, 2023 
 
Page 44 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 In the event of  any SAE  (other than death),  the subject  will be instructed  to contact  [CONTACT_8350] (Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461])  using the phone number provided 
in the Informed Consent  Form.  All subjects  experiencing  an SAE  will be seen by a 
Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_148959].  
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1. RANDOMIZATION  
Randomized treatments will be assign ed by [CONTACT_149011] a randomly generated 
numeric sequence.  
The randomization code will not be revealed to study subjects , Investigators, clinical 
staff, study monitors  or the Sponsor  until all subjects have completed therapy and the 
database has been finalized and locked .  
Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken. The blind may be broken 
only if specific emergency treatment is indicated . The date, time and reason for the 
unblinding must be documented in the CRFs , and the Medical Monitor must be informed 
as soon as possible. 
11.2. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized subjects. All efficacy 
analyses will be conducted in this analysis set and subjects will be included in the group to which they were randomized. 
The Safety analysis set includes all subjects who receive study treatment. All safety 
analyses will be completed in the Safety analysis set and subjects will be included in the 
group based on the treatment actually received.  
11.3. S
TATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
11.3.1 P rimary Efficacy Analysis  
Each of the two co- primary endpoints will be analyzed using a linear mixed model for 
repeated measurements. The dependent variable is the change from baseline and the 
model will include fixed effects for treatment group ( two levels ), week ( 5 levels, 
corresponding to Weeks 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52), the treatment group-by- week interaction, 
and the randomization stratification variable. The baseline value of the corresponding 
endpoint will be included as a covariate and the unstructured covariance model will be Page 47 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125)  FINAL Version  3.0, FEBRUARY 15, 2023 
 
Page 45 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 used. The Baseline Visit ( Study Day 1) ADAS -Cog12 and ADCS -ADL assessments will 
represent the baseline value for these variables.  
 
For each of the two co -primary endpoints, the primary analysis will compare the [ADDRESS_171265] at the alpha = 0.05 level 
of significance. Study success requires that both co- primary comparisons are stat istically 
significant.  
 
11.3.2 Secondary Analys es 
The iADRS18,19 is a linear combination of scores from two well- established, widely 
accepted, therapeutically sensitive measures of AD: the ADAS -Cog and ADCS -iADL 
(the instrumental component of the ADCS -ADL) . The iADRS has been validated and 
statistical properties of the composite performance have been described20. All items of 
the ADAS -Cog12 and the ADCS -iADL will be included to generate this primary efficacy 
composite measurement without additional weightin g. 
 Secondary clinical endpoint data 
(iADRS, NPI, MMSE, and Z BI) measured repeatedly will 
be analyzed using the same types of linear mixed models as described for the primary analysis.  
Plasma assays may include P -tau181 and/or P -tau217, SavaDx and neurofilament light 
chain, and additional plasma biomarkers may be measured. A ll plasma biomarker  data 
involving repeated measures  will also be analyzed using the same types of linear mixed 
models as described for the primary analysis.  
CDR -SB data will be analyzed using ANCOVA models with treatment group as a factor 
and the baseline value as a covariate.  
All secondary analyses will be conducted using two- sided tests at the alpha = 0.05 level 
of significance, with no adjustments for mult iplicity.  
11.4. S
AFETY  ANALYSIS  
Adverse events  reported  on case report  forms  will be mapped  to preferred  terms  and 
organ systems using the MedDRA  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_16816].  Vital signs and clinical laboratory 
results  will be descriptively  summarized  in terms  of change from  screening  values.  
11.5. SAMPLE SIZE 
Approximately seven hundred fifty (750) subject s will be enrolled  in this study. The 
sample  size was determined  by a power analysis of ADAS -Cog in a similar population 
over 52 weeks . This analysis determined that group sizes of 300 are powered to  show a Page 48 of 141

Page 46 of 52     CONFIDENTIAL  
 45% difference from placebo at 52 weeks with 90% power and a two- sided significance 
level of 0.05.  The power calculation assumes a true mean change from baseline for 
placebo of 5.[ADDRESS_171266] deviation of 8.5 points.  Assuming a drop- out of 
20%, each treatment group should enroll 375 subjects.  
12. STUDY TERMINATION 
The study will be terminated  following completion  of the study or at any time at the 
discretion  of the Sponsor. 
13. DATA COLLECTION,  RETENTION  AND MONITORING  
13.1. CASE  REPORT  FORMS  
The CRF will be provided as an Electronic Data Capture  (EDC ) system  that will serve as 
the collection method for subject  data. The subject s in the study will not be identified  by 
[CONTACT_149012] (or CRO  designee)  but will 
be identif ied by a unique subject  number.  
All clinical  information requested  in this protocol will be recorded  in the EDC 
system .  It is strongly recommended that data entry  be completed with in [ADDRESS_171267]’s visit.  In case of error  noted on paper source documents , the correction will be 
noted, initialed  and dated. 
EDC data must be reviewed  and verified  for accuracy  and signed -off by [CONTACT_149013].  Paper source documents, if used, will remain  at the 
Investigator's site at the completion  of the study. 
13.2. AVAILABILITY AND RETENTION OF INVESTIGATIONAL RECORDS  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other  authorized 
representatives  of the Sponsor (or designee) and Regulatory Agency  (e.g., FDA)  
inspectors upon request.  To assure  accuracy  of data collected  in the EDC , it is 
mandator
y that Sponsor representatives  have access  to original source documents (e.g., 
subject  records,  subject  charts,  and laboratory  reports).  During  review  of these 
documents, the subject's anonymity will be maintained  with adherence to professional 
standards of confidentiality  and applicable laws.  A file for each subject  must be 
maintained  that includes  the signed ICF and all source documentation related  to that 
subject.  The Investigator must ensure the reliability  and availability  of source 
documents for the EDC . Page 49 of 141

 2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. MECHANISM OF ACTION  
Cassava Sciences , Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_148943], a novel drug candidate designed to treat 
and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Simufilam binds with femtomolar 
affinity to an altered conformation of filamin A (FLNA)  that is induced by [CONTACT_148986] 1-
42 (Aβ42), present in AD brain and cri tical to the toxicity of A β42.1-3 Simufilam binding 
reverses th e altered FLNA conformation and restores FLNA’s native shape, preventing 
two toxic signaling cascades of A β42. Aβ42, in monomer or small oligomer form,  hijack s 
the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( α7nAChR) and signal s via this receptor to 
hyperphosphorylate tau. T his signaling requires the recruitment of altered FLNA to this 
receptor . In addition, altered FLNA also links to  toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to allow A β42 
to persist ently activate this receptor , leading to inflammatory cytokine release and 
neuroinflammation. Normal FLNA does not associate with either α7nAChR or TLR4. In 
addition to disrupting the normal functions of α7nAChR and tau protein, Aβ42’s toxic 
signaling to hyperphosphorylate tau leads to the signature [CONTACT_149035]. In two AD 
mouse models and in postmortem human AD brain tissue, simufilam restored function of 
three receptors that are impaired in AD: the α7nAChR, the N-methyl-D- aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR),  and the insulin receptor (IR).2,[ADDRESS_171278] simufilam both to improve 
cognition and to slow AD progression. Both mouse models used a dose of 20 mg/kg/day  
(equivalent to 60 mg/m2/day).  
2.2. SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY  
A robust nonclinical ADME, safety pharmacology, and general and genetic toxicology 
program has been conducted with simufilam. In vitro  metabolic profiling showed minimal 
metabolism across several species including humans. Simufilam was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_148944] 100% oral bioavailability, a 2.67-h 
half-life in dog, dose-proportional PK and no accumulation. Simufilam does not inhibit or 
induce major CYP450 enzymes, nor is a substrate or inhibitor of major human drug transporters at clinically relevant concentrations . Safety pharmacology studies showed no 
adverse effects on gross behavioral and physiologica l parameters in the Irwin test of CNS 
toxicity in rats, no adverse effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume or minute volume in the rat respi[INVESTIGATOR_148945], and no adverse effects on arterial blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters in the dog cardiovascular study. The in vitro  hERG test for cardiotoxicity also 
indicated no adverse effect. A full battery of genotoxicity studies was conducted ( in vitro  
bacterial Ames, in vitro  chromosomal aberration, and in vivo  rat micronucleus test) and all Page 64 of 141

Page 10 of 43     CONFIDENTIAL  
 were negative. An in vitro  specificity screen showed no significant activation or inhibition 
of a panel of 68 receptors, channels and transporters. 
Simufilam was tested  in single dose and repeat dose oral toxicity studies of up to 6 months 
in rats and 9 months in dogs. A 6-month repeat dose oral toxicity study in rat s (PTI-125-
NC-049) used the same doses as a 28- day study (50, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day), which 
found 500 mg/kg/day to be the no-adverse- effect -level (NOAEL) . In the 6 -month study, 
the toxicological response was characterized by [CONTACT_148987] 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day  animals, 
including increased hepatic weight, hepatocellular hypertrophy and vacuolation, 
single/multiple basophilic/ eosinophilic/clear cell focus, hepatocellular degeneration, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and oval cell hyperplasia. The presence of bile pi[INVESTIGATOR_148946]. These findings correlated with changes to the clinical chemistry profile, 
including increased ALP and total/direct bilirubin. Over the 1- month recovery period, there 
was complete recovery of the hepatocellular degeneration and partial recovery of 
hepatocellular hypertrophy; other microscopic findings in the liver remained. The NOAEL 
in this 6 -month study was 50 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 300 mg/m2), corresponding to a 
safet y margin of 6- and 1.6- fold based on C max and AUC over the 100 mg b.i.d. dose in 
human subjects. A second 6 -month repeat dose oral toxicity study in rats determine d the 
6-month NOAEL in the rat to be < 125 mg/kg/day, based on hepatocellular vacuolation in 
both sexes and hepatocellular hypertrophy in females at 125 and 250 mg/kg. We are 
evaluating  whether these liver effects are rat specific.  
In a 9 -month toxicity study in dogs (PTI -125- NC-050) , the no- effect -level (NOE L) of 
simufilam was 25 mg/kg. The high dose of 200 mg/kg/day  was decreased to 150 mg/kg/day 
after 1 month due to bodyweight loss considered unsustainable for 9 months . Clinical signs 
were slight hypoactivity and incidences of slight muscle fasciculations  early in the study, 
and salivation. There were no pathology findings, but the high dose was considered adverse 
due to two unexplained deaths. The 75 mg/kg/day NOAEL (equivalent to 1500 mg/m2) 
provides 38- and 19- fold safety margins based on  Cmax and AUC  over the [ADDRESS_171279] -in-human, double-blind, single ascending dose clinical study (PTI -125-01) was 
conducted in healthy normal volunteers, age 18- 45 with oral dosing solution. Doses were 
placebo, 50, 100 and 200 mg (equivalent to 31, 62, and 123 mg/m2, respectively)  
administered to three different groups of volunteers . The study showed dose proportional Page 65 of 141

 PK, a half -life ranging from 4.5 to 6 h, and there were no drug- related  adverse events  (AEs). 
In a 28-day phase 2a study (PTI-125-03) , 13 subjects with mild-to-moderate AD receiv ed 
simufilam 100 mg b.i.d. as oral tablets. Subjects  had Mini- Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) 
scores  ≥ 16 and ≤ 24, and were age 50 -85 with a CSF total tau/Aβ 42 ratio ≥ 0.30. A second 
CSF sample was collected on Day 28 , allowing assessment of change from baseline in 
biomarkers using commercial ELISA kits.  All 8 biomarkers that are elevated in AD were 
significantly reduced from baseline  (Fig. 1).[ADDRESS_171280] reduction in 
phospho- tau (P-Tau181) confirms  the mechanism of action of simufilam. Simufilam was 
safe and well tolerated in all subject s.

A phase 2b  randomized , placebo -controlled clinical study (PTI-125-02) of simufilam 50 or 
100 mg tablets or placebo (1:1:1)  enrolled [ADDRESS_171281] s with MMSE 
16-26. Both 50 and 100 mg doses significantly improved eleven CSF biomarkers of AD 
pathology, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and blood- brain barrier  integrity ( Fig. 
2). CSF biomarker analyses were conducted blind to treatment and timepoint by [CONTACT_149019], and screening and Day [ADDRESS_171282]  were measured in triplicate in the 
same ELISA plates. Albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured by 
[CONTACT_148988]. These data suggest disease modification and replicate Phase 2a results in a well -controlled study.

include the assessment of simufilam’s effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms  and caregiver 
burden. A third objective is to  investigate the effect of simufilam treatment on plasma 
biomarkers. 
4. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN 
In this Phase 3 clinical study, approximately 750 subjects with mild -to-moderate AD wil l 
receive placebo  or 100 mg tablets of simufilam, twice daily, for 52 weeks . Randomization 
(1:1) will be stratified by [CONTACT_148991] (1 6-20 and 21-27).  
 
Subject s, 50- 87 years of age,  will be selected for screening based on a diagnosi s of AD 
consistent with Stages 4 or 5 on the Alzheimer’s continuum (N ational Institute on Aging – 
Alzheimer’s Association [ZIP_CODE]). Subjects must have MMSE ≥ 16 and ≤ 27, and a Clinical 
Dementia Rating Global Score (CDR -GS) of 0.5, [ADDRESS_171286] 
confirmed PET or fluid biomarker evidence of AD pathophysiology prior to randomization  
(see Section 5.2 – Inclusion Criteria for details) . 
 
Once subjects have been s atisfactorily screened for study participation, visits to the 
research clinic will occur on Study Day  1 and at Weeks 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52.

The co -primary endpoints include the 12- item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – 
Cognitive Subscale (ADAS -Cog12) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – 
Activities of Daily Living (ADCS -ADL), both assessed as the change from baseline to the 
end of the double-blind treatment period (Week 52).  Secondary endpoint s include the integrated Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes 
(CDR -SB). A  brief questionnaire assessing caregiver burden, the Zarit Burden Interview 
(ZBI), will be collected as an additional seco ndary endpoint.  
 Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_148992], vital signs, clinical labs, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) at every visit. All subjects will undergo 
MRI  during screening to ensure entry criteria are met. ECG s will be conducted Day 1 and 
Weeks 4, 28 and 52. A  complete physical and neurological examination will be performed 
at screening, and brief examinations will be performed at all other visits. Weight will be 
measured during the Screening Period, on Study Day 1 and at all other visits.  
 A limited number of research sites will be invited to participate in  the PK and plasma 
biomarker sub -study. Collection of PK samples will enable an exposure -response analysis.  
Approximately 100 subjects will participate (50 per group). P lasma samples will be 
collected during the Screening Visit and again at Weeks [ADDRESS_171288] (DSMB) will meet periodically to review 
subject  safety assessments  and determine if dosing may continue.  A charter will be 
developed with specific guidance for the DSMB.

 6. STUDY DRUG  
6.1. SIMUFILAM  PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND PREPARATION  
Investigational simufilam (100 milligram active strength) and matching placebo will 
be supplied by C assava as coated tablets .   
All remaining  unused simufilam study drug will be returned to the Sponsor or 
designee.  
6.1.1. Packaging and Labelling 
Simufilam or placebo tablets in plastic bottles will be supplied in 70- count bottles  for 
a 4-week supply or 188-count bottles for a 12-week supply. B ottles include a desiccant 
canister and are closed with a foil seal and child -resistant (CR) cap. Each bottle contains 
7 or 10 days of extr a medication to accommodate scheduling flexibility with clinic 
visits.   
 
A Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS ®) that is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant 
will be used to track adherence to the b.i.d. dosing schedule . MEMS ® caps will be 
supplied to replace  the conventional CR cap on each bottle. One (1) MEMS cap will 
be assigned to each subject for use throughout the study. Each MEMS cap has an LCD 
display that provides immediate visual indication of the number of doses taken that day 
and the number of hours since the prior dose that day, resetting to zero each night. 
Instruction s on management and use of MEMS caps will be provided in the Pharmacy 
manual and during site training. 
 
Each bottle is labeled with a  unique double -blind ID number that is randomly assigned 
to a treatment. A computer -based clinical study management system will specif y the 
bottle  ID number to be dispensed according to the subject’s treatment randomization. 
 
6.1.2. Storage 
The investigational drug supplies must be stored in a locked cabinet or room with 
limited access at controlled room temperature, 20-25º C (68-77º F) and protected from 
moisture.   
6.1.3. Drug Accountability 
The Investigator will be responsible for monitoring the receipt,  storage,  dispensing 
and accounting of all study medications  according  to site standard operating 
procedures ( SOPs ). All records documenting the chain of custody for the study 
medication  must be retained  in the site study file. Accurate,  original site records  Page 75 of 141

available to the S ponsor (or designee)  and appropriate  regulatory agencies  upon 
request.  
6.2. ADMINISTRATION AND DOSING REGIMEN  
Subject s will be randomized to receive  placebo  or 100 mg simufilam twice daily 
(b.i.d.).  Study drug can be taken with or without food.  
6.3. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Use of prescription or non- prescription medications will be recorded  during the study.  
Chronic medications must be stable for 4 weeks prior to screening  [Note – see Inclusion 
Criterion #12 and Exclusion Criteri a #29 and #30 for additional details regarding 
background medications frequently prescribed to patients with AD].   
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Appendix A pr esents the Schedule of Activities. 
Prior to  any study- related  activities,  the Informed  Consent Form  (ICF)  must be signed 
and dated  by [CONTACT_19578]  (or a legal ly authorized representative) and  the study partner.  
The format  and content of the ICF must be agreed  upon by [CONTACT_11097](s),  the appropriate IRB and the Sponsor. The signed and dated  ICF must 
be retained by  [CONTACT_148999]'s file. 
 
7.1. EVALUATIONS BY [CONTACT_149000]-up visits can be scheduled +/- five (5) days from the  targeted Study Visit date.   
 
7.1.1. Screening  Period  (No greater  than a 60-day duration prior to Study Day 1 ) 
The Sponsor recognizes the Screening Period assessments and procedures may not 
necessarily be completed in a single visit. A subject is permitted to be screened over 
more than one calendar day if, in the Investigator’s judgment, such scheduling will optimize the accuracy of Screening Period assessments and procedures.   The following 
will be completed during the Screening Period: 
• Informed  Consent.  
• Review  of Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
• Collect d emographic information ( e.g., sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity, years 
of education)  Page 76 of 141

 • Medical and surgical  history  
• Review  concomitant medications , and any discontinued medications, in the 4 
weeks prior to screening. 
• To the extent such information is available, revie w and record any 
investigational drugs administered during past clinical study participation 
regardless of the date of such participation.  
• History of drug, alcohol and tobacco use  
• eCOA  order of administration at screening:  
• MMSE  
• CDR  
• Geriatric Depression Scale

key vital signs (blood pressure  [supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]] , temperature , pulse rate), height and 
weight (to calculate BMI)  
• A 12-lead  ECG  (5-min  supi[INVESTIGATOR_050])  
• Laboratory assessments,  including routine s erum  chemistry,  TSH , free T4, Vitamin 
B12 levels, HBsAg, HCV -Ab, hematology, urinalysis and urine  screen  for drug s of 
abuse. P lasma for P-tau181 assessment will also be collected unless there is 
documented evidence of AD pathophysiology prior to screening.  For subjects with 
diabetes, collect a blood sample for HbA1C. 
• Once the clinical and laboratory assessments above have been completed  and 
verified to be consistent with study participation , schedule brain MRI to 
confirm subject meets MRI -specific entry criteria ( Note – previous brain MRI 
results , with appropriate documentation, will be accepted for up to 6 months

transpeptidase (GGT),  lactose  dehydrogenase (LDH) . 
• Urinalysis: color, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose , ketones,  occult  blood, 
nitrites  and leukocyte esterase.   A “reflex” microscopic examination  will be 
performed  if protein, occult blood, nitrites  or leukocyte esterase is present  on the 
basic analysis . 
• Screening Period :  During the Screening Period only, bloods will be drawn for TSH, 
free T4, Vitamin B12, HepBsAg, HCV -Ab, HbA1C (diabetic  subjects  only) and 
plasma P-tau181 (Note – plasma collection for P-tau181 not required if subject has 
documented evidence of AD pathophysiology prior to screening). Urine to screen  
for drugs of abuse  (amphetamines, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_148955]) will also 
be collected during the Screening Period . 
7.2.2. Collection of Whole Blood Samples for ApoE Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_148956] A poE will be collected on Study Day 1 (please 
review instructions as per lab  manual ). 
7.2.3. Preparation of Samples  from PK and Plasma Biomarker Sub -study Participants  
At each blood collection for PK and biomarkers, blood samples will be drawn into a 
Vacutainer® tube (10 mL per tube) containing K2EDTA. The tubes will be placed on 
ice. Within 30 min of collection, the blood will be centrifuged at approximately 1000 X G for 1 5 min, preferably at 4- 5°C. Within 30 min of centrifuging, plasma will be 
transferred to polypropylene tubes, and stored at -70°C  until shipped to the central lab 
(complete instructions as per lab manual).   
8. COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENTS  
8.1. M
INI-MENTAL STATE EXAM (MMSE)  
The M MSE6 is a set of standardized questions covering several  target areas: orientation, 
registration, attention and calculation, short -term verbal recall, naming, repetition, 3-
step command, reading, writing, and visuospatial cognitive assessment. Administration Page 83 of 141

Page 29 of 43     CONFIDENTIAL  
 of the MMSE is estimated to take approximately 10 minutes . 
8.2. CLINICAL DEMENTIA RATING (CDR)  
Washington University’s CDR7 characterizes six domains of cognitive and functional 
performance applicable to AD and related dementias: memor y, orientation, judgment 
and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The 
study partner  is interviewed first by a qualified rater who assesses all six domains . The 
subject is then interviewed in the absence of the caregiver. A CDR  global score can be 
calculated by [CONTACT_149022]’s online algorithm 
(https://biostat.wustl.edu/~adrc/cdrpgm/index.html) where 0 = no dementia , and scores 
of 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 = questionable, mild, moderate, or severe dementia, respectively.  The 
sum of boxes (i.e., CDR -SB)[ADDRESS_171309]- GS in  patients with mild dementia.   
8.3. ALZHEIMER ’S DISEASE ASSESSMENT SCALE – COGNITI VE SUBSCALE 12 (ADAS -
COG12) 
The ADAS -Cog9,10 is a psychometrician -administered battery comprised of several 
cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and 
spontaneous speech. The ADAS -Cog12 (which includes Delayed Word Recall) will be 
administered to all subjects  at various key visits throughout the study. 
8.4. NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INVENTORY (NPI)   
A study partner  interview, t he 12- item NPI11 records  frequency and severity of common 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia (Hallucinations, Delusions, 
Agitation/aggression, Dysphoria/depression, Anxiety, Irritability, Disinhibition, 
Euphoria, Apathy, Aberrant motor behavior, Sleep, and nighttime  behavior change, 
Appetite and eating change). The study partner  is then asked to rate their own  distress 
for the subject’s behavioral symptoms occurring in the past 4 weeks.  
8.5. ALZHEIMER ’S DISEASE COOPERATIVE STUDY – ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING 
(ADCS -ADL -AD) 
The ADCS -ADL12 is a 23 -item study partner  questionnaire that covers both basic 
activities of daily living (ADL) (e.g., eating and toileting) and more complex ADL or 
instrumental ADL (e.g., using the telephone, managing finances, preparing a meal). 
8.6. COLUMBIA -SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE (C-SSRS)  
The C -SSRS13 is an assessment tool used to assess the  lifetime suicidality of a subject  Page 84 of 141

8.8. GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE  (GDS ) 
The GDS16 is a 30 -item yes/no question test designed to screen for depression in elderly 
persons. The GDS short form (15-items)[ADDRESS_171311], ADAS -Cog12, GDS, NPI, ADCS -ADL, C -SSRS, and 
ZBI will be captured electronically by [CONTACT_149004] 21 CFR Part 11 
compliant. Data collected by [CONTACT_149005]’s 
database.   
9. EARLY DISCONTINUATION 
Subjects  may choose to discontinue study drug or study participation  at any time,  for 
any reason,  and without prejudice.  Moreover, a subject may be withdrawn at any time 
at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral or administrative 
reasons. Discontinued subjects should be followed according to medical practice standards, and the outcome documented. Follow -up is required if the subject is 
discontinued due to an adverse event (AE). Any comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complaints made by [CONTACT_149006][INVESTIGATOR_148968] (CRF ) and source documents.  
The following must be completed  and documented in the source documents and 
CRFs  for all subjects  who discontinue the study early:  
• The reason  for early  study discontinuation.  If the subject is withdrawn for more than 
one reason, each reason should be documented in the source documents and the Page 85 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125) FINAL  Version  2.0, JULY 20, [ADDRESS_171312] clinically relevant reason should be entered on the CRF. 
• Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature  and pulse), brief physica l and neurologic 
examination , weight, c linical laboratory  tests,  ECG,  use of  concomitant 
medications  and adverse events  should be obtained at discharge prior to release. 
• Blood draw for plasma  biomarkers  
• ADAS -Cog, MMSE, CDR, ADCS -ADL , NPI , ZBI and C -SSRS (as detailed in 
Section 7.1.6 – Early Termination Visit) , if not performed within the last 3 0 days. 
10. ADVERSE EVENTS/SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1. ADVERSE  EVENTS  - DEFINITION  
An Adverse E vent (AE) is any undesirable  event  that occurs  to a subject  during a  study, 
whether  or not that event  is considered  study drug- related. Monitoring for AEs will start 
at dosing. Examples  include: 
• Any treatment -emergent  signs and symptoms (events  that are marked  by a change 
from  the subject's baseline/entry  status  [e.g., an increase in severity  or frequency  of 
pre-existing  abnormality  or disorder])  
• All reactions  from  study drug, an overdose, abuse of drug, withdrawal  phenomena, 
sensitivity  or toxicity  to study drug 
• Apparently unrelated  illnesses  
• Injury or accidents  (Note:  if a medical  condition is known to have caused  the injury 
or accident,  the medical  condition and the accident  should be reported  as two separate 
medical events  [e.g., for a fall secondary to dizziness,  both "dizziness"  and "fall" 
should be recorded  separately])  
• Extensions or exacerbations  of symptoms, subjective subject -reported  events, new 
clinically  significant abnormalities  in clinical  laboratory, physiological testing  or 
physical examination  
 
All AEs,  whether  or not related  to the study drug, must be fully  and completely  
documented on  the AE page of the CRF  and in the subject's clinical  chart.  
In the event  that a subject  is withdrawn  from  the study because  of an AE, it must be 
recorded  on the CRF  as such. The subject  should be followed and treated  by [CONTACT_149023].  Page 86 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125) FINAL  Version  2.0, JULY 20, [ADDRESS_171313]  a non- specific question (e.g., "Have you 
noticed  anything different  since your dose of the study medication?")  to assess whether 
any AEs have been  experienced  since the last assessment.  AEs will be identified  and 
documented in the Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) system  in appropriate medical  
terminology. The severity  and the relationship  to the study drug will be  determined  and 
reported  in EDC  (see below).  
10.2. ADVERSE EVENTS - SEVERITY RATING  
The severity  of each AE should be characterized  and then classified  into one of three 
clearly  defined  categories  as follows: 
• Mild  – the AE does not interfere  in a significant manner  with the subject's  normal 
functioning level. It may be an  annoyance.  
• Mode rate – the AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazar dous 
to health. It  is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
• Severe – the AE produces significant  impairment  of functioning or incapacitation  
and is a definite  hazard  to the subject's health.  
These three categories  are based  on the Investigator's clinical  judgment, which  in turn 
depends on  consideration of various factors  such as the subject's report  and the physician's 
observations. The severity  of the AE should be recorded  in the appropriate section  of the 
EDC . 
10.3. ADVERS E EVENTS  – RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY   DRUG 
The relationship  of each AE to the study drug will be classified  into one of three defined  
categories  as follows: 
• Unlikely  –   a causal  relationship  between  the AE and the study drug is unlikely. 
• Possible –  a causal  relationship  between  the AE and the study drug is possible. 
• Probable – a causal  relationship between  the AE and the study drug is probable. 
For example,  the AE is a common adverse event known to occur  with the 
pharmacological class  of the study drug; or the AE abated  on study drug  
discontinuation and reappeared  upon rechallenge  with the study drug. 
These three categories  are based  on the Investigator's clinical judgment, which  in turn 
depends on consideration  of various factors  such as the subject's report,  the timing  of 
the AE in relationship  to study drug administration/discontinuation, the physician's Page 87 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125) FINAL  Version  2.0, JULY 20, 2021 
 
Page 33 of 43     CONFIDENTIAL  
 observations and the physician's prior experience.  The relationship  of the AE to the study 
drug will be recorded  in the appropriate section  of the EDC . 
10.4. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS - DEFINITIONS  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  includes (but is not limited  to) an experience occurring  
at any dose that results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life-threatening  event  (i.e., the subject  is at immediate  risk of death  from  the 
reaction  as it occurs).  "Life -threatening" does not include an event  that, had it 
occurred  in a more  serious  form,  might have caused  death. For example,  drug - 
induced hep
atitis  that resolved without evidence  of hepatic failure  would not be  
considered  life-threatening  even  though drug- induced  hepatitis  can be fatal.  
• In-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], not an emergency  room visit)  or 
prolongation of existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
• A persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  (i.e., a substantial disruption of 
the subject's ability  to carry  out normal life functions). 
• A congenital  anomaly/birth defect . 
 
In addition, medical  and scientific  judgment should be exercised  in deciding whether  
other situations  should be considered  an SAE  (i.e., important medical  events  that may 
not be  immediately  life-threatening  or result  in death  but may jeopardize the subject  or 
may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes  listed  
in the definition  above). Examples  of such medical  events  include (but are not limited  
to): allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or 
the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
An unexpected  AE is one for which  the specificity  or severity  is not consistent with the 
current Investigator's  Brochure. For example,  hepatic  necrosis  would be unexpected  (by 
[CONTACT_14213])  if the Investigator's Brochure listed  only elevated  hepatic 
enzymes  or hepatitis.  
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected  (by 
[CONTACT_149009])  if the Investigator's Brochure listed  only cerebral  vascular  
accidents.  
10.5. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING  
The reporting of SAEs  by [CONTACT_149010]  (e.g., FDA)  is a 
regulatory requirement.  Each  regulatory a gency  has established  a timetable  for Page 88 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125) FINAL  Version  2.0, JULY 20, [ADDRESS_171314] be reported  immediately  (within  24 h of learning  of the  event)  by e-
mail to: 
Premier Research Global Pharmacovigilance  
 
 
Do not delay  reporting a suspected  SAE  to obtain additional information.  Any 
additional information, if collected,  can be reported  to the Sponsor as a follow-up to 
the initial report.  
SAEs  must be immediately reported  to the responsible IRB. 
In the case of a death  or other SAE  that has occurred  within  [ADDRESS_171315] also report  such an event  within  24 hours 
of being notified. Your local  IRB may also require  these reports.  
In the event of  any SAE  (other than death),  the subject  will be instructed  to contact  [CONTACT_8350] (Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461])  using the phone number provided 
in the Informed Consent  Form.  All subjects  experiencing  an SAE  will be seen by a 
Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_148959].  
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1. RANDOMIZATION  
Randomized treatments will be assign ed by [CONTACT_149011] a randomly generated 
numeric sequence.  
The randomization code will not be revealed to study subjects , Inve stigators, clinical 
staff, study monitors  or the Sponsor  until all subjects have completed therapy and the 
database has been finalized and locked .  
Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken. The blind may be broken 
only if specific emergency treatment is indicated . The date, time and reason for the 
unblinding must be documented in the CRFs , and the medical monitor must be informed 
as soon as possible. 
11.2. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized subjects. All efficacy  
analyses will be conducted in this analysis set and subjects will be included in the group to which they were randomized. Page 89 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI -125-07 
Simufilam (PTI -125) FINAL  Version  2.0, JULY 20, 2021 
 
Page 35 of 43     CONFIDENTIAL  
 The Safety analysis set includes all subjects who receive study treatment. All safety 
analyses will be completed in the Safety analys is set and subjects will be included in the 
group based on the treatment actually received.  
11.3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
11.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Each of the two co- primary endpoints will be analyzed using a linear mixed model for 
repeated measurements. The dependent variable is the change from baseline and the 
model will include fixed effects for treatment group ( two levels), week ( 5 levels, 
corresponding to Weeks 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52), the treatment group-by- week interaction, 
and the randomization stratification variable. The baseline value of the corresponding endpoint will be included as a covariate and the unstructured covariance model will be 
used. The Study Day [ADDRESS_171316] at the alpha = 0.05 level 
of significance. Study success requires that both co-primary comparisons are statistically 
significant.  
 
11.3.2 Secondary Analys es 
The iADRS
18,19 is a linear combination of scores from two well- established, widely 
accepted, therapeutically sensitive measures of AD: the ADAS -Cog and ADCS -iADL 
(the instrume ntal component of the ADCS -ADL). The iADRS has been validated and 
statistical properties of the composite performance have been described20. All items of 
the ADAS -Cog12 and the ADCS -iADL will be included to generate this primary efficacy 
composite measurem ent without additional weighting. 
 Secondary clinical endpoint data 
(iADRS, NPI, MMSE and ZBI) measured repeatedly will 
be analyzed using the same types of linear mixed models as described for the primary analysis.  
Plasma assays may include P -tau181, SavaDx and neurofilament light chain, and 
additional plasma biomarkers may be measured. A ll plasma biomarker  data involving 
repeated measures  will also be analyzed using the same types of linear mixed models as 
described for the primary analysis.

 All secondary analyses will be conducted using two- sided tests at the alpha = 0.05 level 
of significance, with no adjustments for multiplicity.  
11.4. SAFETY  ANALYSIS  
Adverse events  reported  on case report  forms  will be mapped  to preferred  terms  and 
organ systems using the MedDRA  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_16816].  Vital signs and clinical laboratory 
results  will be descriptively  summarized  in terms  of change from  screening  values.  
11.5. SAMPLE SIZE 
Approximately seven hundred fifty (750) subject s will be enrolled  in this study. The 
sample  size was determined  by a power analysis of ADAS -Cog in a similar population 
over 52 weeks . This analysis determined that group sizes of 300 are powered to  show a 
45% difference from placebo at 52 weeks with 90% power and a two- sided significance 
level of 0.05.  The power calculation assumes a true mean change from baseline for 
placebo of 5.[ADDRESS_171317] deviation of 8.5 points.  Assuming a drop- out of 
20%, each treatment group should enroll 375 subjects.  
12. STUDY TERMINATION 
The study will be terminated  following completion  of the study or at any time at the 
discretion  of the Sponsor. 
13. DATA COLLECTION,  RETENTION  AND MONITORING  
13.1. CASE  REPORT  FORMS  
The CRF will be provided as an Electronic Data Capture  (EDC ) system  that will serve as 
the collection method for subject  data. The subject s in the study will not be identified  by 
[CONTACT_149012] (or CRO  designee)  but will 
be identif ied by a unique subject  number.  
All clinical  information requested  in this protocol will be recorded  in the EDC 
system .  It is strongly recommended that data entry  be completed with in [ADDRESS_171318]’s visit.  In case of error  noted on p aper source documents , the correction will be

Investigator's site at the completion  of the study. 
13.2. AVAILABILITY AND RETENTION OF INVESTIGATIONAL RECORDS  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other  authorized 
representatives  of the Sponsor (or designee) and Regulatory Agency  (e.g., FDA)  
inspectors upon request.  To assure  accuracy  of data collected  in the EDC , it is 
mandatory that Sponsor representatives  have access  to original source documents (e.g., 
subject  records,  subject  charts,  and laboratory  reports).  During  review  of these 
documents, the subject's anonymity will be maintained  with adherence to professional 
standards of confidentiality  and applicable laws.  A file for each subject  must be 
maintained  that includes  the signed ICF and all source documentation related  to that 
subject.  The Investigator must ensure the reliability  and availability  of source 
documents for the EDC . 
Investigators are required to maintain  all study documentation until notification  by [CONTACT_149024].  
The Investigator  is responsible for maintaining  adequate case histories  in each

 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. MECHANISM OF ACTION  
Cassava Sciences, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_148943], a novel drug candidate designed to treat 
and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Simufilam binds with femtomolar 
affinity to an altered conformation of filamin A (FLNA) that is induced by [CONTACT_148986] 1-
42 (Aβ42), present in AD brain and critical to the toxicity of A β42.1-3 Simufilam binding 
reverses th e altered FLNA conformation and restores FLNA’s native shape, preventing 
two toxic signaling cascades of A β42. Aβ42, in monomer or small oligomer form,  hijack s 
the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) and signal s via this receptor to 
hyperphosphorylate tau. T his signaling requires the recruitment of altered FLNA to this 
receptor . In addition, altered FLNA also links to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to allow A β42 
to persisten tly activate this receptor, leading to inflammatory cytokine release and 
neuroinflammation. Normal FLNA does not associate with either α7nAChR or TLR4. In 
addition to disrupting the normal functions of  α7nAChR and tau protein, Aβ42’s toxic 
signaling to hyperphosphorylate tau leads to the signature [CONTACT_149035]. In two AD 
mouse models and in postmortem human AD brain tissue, simufilam restored function of 
three receptors that are impaired in AD: t he α7nAChR, the N- methyl-D- aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR),  and the insulin receptor (IR).2,[ADDRESS_171330] simufilam both to improve 
cognition and to slow AD progression. Both mouse models used a dose of 20 mg/kg/day  
(equivalent to 60 mg/m2/day).  
2.2. SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY  
A robust nonclinical ADME, safety pharmacology, and general and genetic toxicology 
program has been conducted with simufilam. In vitro  metabolic profiling showed minimal 
metabolism across several species including humans. Simufilam was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_148972] 100% oral bioavailability, a 2.67-h 
half-life in dog, dose- proportional PK a nd no accumulation. Simufilam does not inhibit or 
induce major CYP450 enzymes, nor is a substrate or inhibitor of major human drug transporters at clinically relevant concentrations . Safety pharmacology studies showed no 
adverse effects on gross behavioral  and physiologica l parameters in the Irwin test of CNS 
toxicity in rats, no adverse effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume or minute volume in the rat respi[INVESTIGATOR_148945], and no adverse effects on arterial blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters in the dog cardiovascular study. The in vitro  hERG test for cardiotoxicity also 
indicated no adverse effect. A full battery of genotoxicity studies was conducted ( in vitro  
bacterial Ames, in vitro  chromosomal aberration, and in vivo  rat micronucleus test) and  all Page 107 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI- 125-07 
Simufilam (PTI-125) FINAL  Version  1.0, JUNE 30, 2021 
 
Page 10 of 43     CONFIDENTIAL  
 were negative. An in vitro  specificity screen showed no significant activation or inhibition 
of a panel of 68 receptors, channels and transporters. 
Simufilam was tested  in single dose and repeat dose oral toxicity studies of up to 6 months 
in rats and  9 months in dogs. A 6-month repeat dose oral toxicity study in rat s (PTI-125-
NC-049) used the same doses as a 28- day study (50, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day), which 
found 500 mg/kg/day to be the no -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) . In the 6 -month study, 
the toxicological response was characterized by [CONTACT_149025] 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day animals, 
including increased hepatic weight, hepatocellular hypertrophy and vacuolation, 
single/multiple basophilic/ eosinophilic/clear cell focus, hepatocellular degeneration, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and oval cell hyperplasia. The presence of bile pi[INVESTIGATOR_148946]. These findings correlated with changes to the clinical chemistry profile,  
including increased ALP and total/direct bilirubin. Over the 1 -month recovery period, there 
was complete recovery of the hepatocellular degeneration and partial recovery of hepatocellular hypertrophy; other microscopic findings in the liver remained . The NOAEL 
in this 6 -month study was 50 mg/ kg/day (equivalent to 300 mg/m
2), corresponding to a 
safety margin of 6- and 1.6- fold based on C max and AUC over the 100 mg b.i.d. dose in 
human subjects. A second 6-month repeat dose oral toxicity study in rat s determine d the 
6-month NOAEL in the rat to be < 125 mg/kg/day, based on hepatocellular vacuolation in both sexes and hepatocellular hypertrophy in females at 125 and 250 mg/kg. Additional 
work is planned to evaluate whether these liver effects are rat specific.  
In a 9- month toxicity study in dogs (PTI -125- NC-050) , the no- effect -level (NOEL) of 
simufilam was 25 mg/kg. The high dose of 200 mg/kg/day was decreased to 150 mg/kg/day 
after 1 month due to bodyweight loss considered unsustainable for 9 months . Clinical signs 
were slight hypoactivity and incidences of slight muscle fasciculations  early in the study, 
and salivation. There were no pathology findings, but the high dose was considered adverse 
due to two unexplained deaths. The 75 mg/kg/day NOAEL (equivalent to 1500 mg/m
2) 
provides 38- and 19- fold safety margins based on  Cmax and AUC over the [ADDRESS_171331]- in-human , double-blind, si ngle ascending dose clinical study (PTI -125- 01) was 
conducted in healthy normal volunteers , age 18- 45 with oral dosing solution. Doses were 
placebo, 50, 100 and 200 mg (equivalent to 31, 62, and 123 mg/m2, respectively)  
administered to three different groups of volunteers . The study showed dose proportional Page 108 of 141

 PK, a half -life ranging fro m 4.5 to 6 h, and there were no drug- related  adverse events ( AEs). 
In a 28-day phase 2a study  (PTI-125-03), 13 subjects with mild-to-moderate AD receiv ed 
simufilam 100 mg b.i.d. as oral tablets. Subjects had Mini -Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) 
scores ≥ 16 and ≤ 24, and were age 50 -85 with a CSF total tau/Aβ 42 ratio ≥ 0.30. A second 
CSF sample was collected on Day 28, allowing assessment of change from baseline in 
biomarkers  using commercial ELISA kits.  All 8 biomarkers that are elevated in AD were 
significantly reduced  from baseline  (Fig. 1).[ADDRESS_171332] reduction in 
phospho- tau (P-Tau181) confirms  the mechanism of action of simufilam. Simufilam was 
safe and well tolerated in all subject s.

A phase 2b  randomized, placebo -controlled clinical study (PTI-125- 02) of simufilam 50 or 
100 mg tablets or placebo (1:1:1)  enrolled [ADDRESS_171333] s with MMSE 
16-26. Both 50 and 100 mg doses significantly improved eleven CSF biomarkers of AD 
pathology, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and blood- brain barrier integrity  (Fig. 
2). CSF biomarker analyses were conducted blind to treatment and timepoint by [CONTACT_149019], and screening and Day [ADDRESS_171334] were measured in triplicate in the 
same ELISA plates. Albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured by  
[CONTACT_148988]. These data suggest disease 
modification and replicate Phase 2a results in a well -controlled study.

The secondary endpoints in the Phase 2b study  were two cognitive measures using the 
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Subjects were assessed on the 
Paired Associate Learning (PAL) test, measuring epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], and a test of spatial 
working memory. The primary outcome measure  for each was total errors, with errors 
imputed for more difficult levels not reached in the PAL test. Simufilam  produced 
encouraging effect sizes (calculated by [CONTACT_149020]’s g for group sizes of 20), suggesting 
cognitive enhancement ( Fig. 3).  Effect sizes versus placebo for the test of epi[INVESTIGATOR_148964] 0.[ADDRESS_171336] sizes were 0.25 and 0.46 for these respective dose groups. Cognitive enhancement by [CONTACT_149026] α7nAChR, NMDAR and 
insulin receptors and improved synaptic plasticity in 3xTg AD mice and in postmortem human AD brain tissue.  
In both Phase 2 clinical studies, simufilam was well tolerated and no subje cts discontinued 
due to AEs.

include the assessment of simufilam’s effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms  and caregiver 
burden. A third objective is to  investigate the effect of simufilam  treatment on plasma 
biomarkers . 
4. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN 
In this Phase 3 clinical study, approximately 750 subjects with mild -to-moderate AD wil l 
receive placebo  or 100 mg tablets of simufilam, twice daily, for 52 weeks. R andomization 
(1:1) will be stratified by [CONTACT_148991] (1 6-20 and 21-27).  
 
Subjects , 50-87 years of age,  will be selected for screening based on a diagnosi s of AD 
consistent with Stages 4 or 5 on the Alzheimer’s continuum (N ational Institute on Aging – 
Alzheimer’s Association [ZIP_CODE]). Subjects must have  MMSE ≥ 16 and ≤ 27, and a Clinical 
Dementia Rating Global Score (CDR -GS) of 0.5, [ADDRESS_171338] 
confirmed PET or fluid biomarker evidence of AD pathophysiology prior to randomization (see Section 5.2 – Inclusion Criteria for details).  Once subjects have been satisfactorily screened for study participation, visits to the research clinic will occur on Study Day  1 and at Weeks 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52.

The co-primary endpoints include the 12- item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – 
Cogni tive Subscale (ADAS -Cog12) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – 
Activities of Daily Living (ADCS -ADL), both assessed as the change from baseline to the 
end of the double- blind treatment period (Week 52). 
 Secondary endpoint s include the integrated Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes 
(CDR- SB). A brief questionnaire assessing caregiver burden, the Zarit Burden Interview 
(ZBI), will be collected as an additional secondary endpoint.  
 Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_148992], vital signs, clinical labs, and the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) at every visit. All subjects will undergo 
MRI  during screening to ensure entry criteria are met. ECGs will be conducted Day 1 and 
Weeks 4, 28 and 52. A  complete physical and neurological examination will be performed 
at screening, and brief examinations will be performed at all other visits. Weight will be 
measured during the Screening Period, on Study Day 1 and at all other visits.  
 A limited number of research sites will be invited to participate in  the PK and plasma 
biomarker sub-study. Collection of PK samples will enable an exposure -response analy sis. 
Approximately 100 subjects will participate (50 pe r group) . Plasma samples will be 
collected during the Screening Visit and again at Weeks [ADDRESS_171340] (DSMB) will meet periodically to review 
subject safety assessments and determine if dosing may continue. A charter will be 
developed with specific guidance for the DSMB.

 6. STUDY DRUG  
6.1. SIMUFILAM PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND PREPARATION  
Investigational simufilam (100 milligram active strength ) and matching placebo will 
be supplied by C assava as coated tablets .   
All remaining  unused simufilam study drug will be returned to  the Sponsor or 
designee.  
6.1.1. Packaging and Labelling 
Simufilam or placebo tablets in plastic bottles will be supplied in 70 -count bottles  for 
a 4-week supply or 188- count bottles for a 12-week supply. B ottles include a desiccant 
canister and are closed with a foil seal and child -resistant (CR) cap. Each bottle contains 
7 or 10 days of extr a medication to accommodate scheduling flexibility with clinic 
visits.   
 
A Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS ®) that is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant 
will be used to track adherence to the b.i.d. dosing schedule. CR-MEMS ® caps will be 
supplied to replace the conventional CR cap on each bottle. One (1) CR -MEMS cap 
will be assigned to each subject for use throughout the study. Each CR -MEMS cap has 
an LCD display that provides immediate visual indication of the number of doses taken 
that day and the number of hours since the prior dose that day, resetting to zero each 
night. I nstruction s on management and use of CR -MEMS caps will be provided in the 
Pharmacy manual and during site training. 
 
Each bottle is labeled with a unique double -blind ID number  that is randomly assigned 
to a treatment. A computer- based clinical study management system will specif y the 
bottle ID number to be dispensed according to the subject’s treatment randomization.  
 
6.1.2. Storage 
The investigational drug supplies must be stored in a locked cabinet or room with 
limited access at controlled room temperature, 20-25º C (68-77º F) and protected from 
moisture.   
6.1.3. Drug Accountability 
The Investigator will be responsible for monitoring  the receipt,  storage, dispensing 
and accounting of all study medications according to site standard operating 
procedures ( SOPs ). All records documenting the chain of custody for the study 
medication  must be retained  in the site study  file. Accurate,  original site records Page 118 of 141

7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Appendix A  presents the Schedule of Activities. 
Prior  to any study- related  activities,  the Informed  Consent Form  (ICF) must  be signed  
and dated  by [CONTACT_423]  (or a legal ly authorized  representative ) and the study partner .  
The format  and content of the ICF must be agreed  upon by [CONTACT_9532](s),  the appropriate  IRB and the Sponsor. The signed  and dated  ICF must 
be retained by  [CONTACT_148999]'s file. 
 
7.1. EVALUATIONS BY [CONTACT_149000]-up visits can be scheduled +/- five  (5) days from the  targeted Study Visit date.   
 
7.1.1. Screening  Period  (No greater than a 60-day duration prior to Study Day 1 ) 
The Sponsor recognizes the Screening Period assessments and procedures may not 
necessarily be completed in a single visit. A subject is permitted to be screened over 
more than one calendar day if, in the Investigator’s judgment, such scheduling will 
optimize the accuracy of Screening Period assessments and procedures.   The following 
will be completed during the Screening Period:

8. COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENTS  
8.1. MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAM (MMSE)  
The M MSE6 is a set of standardized questions co vering several  target areas: orientation, 
registration, attention and calculation, short -term verbal recall, naming, repetition, 3 -
step command, reading, writing, and visuospatial cognitive assessment. Administration 
of the MMSE is estimated to take approximately 10 min utes. 
8.2. CLINICAL DEMENTIA RATING (CDR)  
Washington University’s CDR7 characterizes six domains of cognitive and functional 
performance applicable to AD and related dementias: memory, orientation, judgment 
and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The 
study partner  is interviewed first by a qualified rater who assesses all six domains . The 
subject is then interviewed in the absence of the caregiver. A CDR  global score can be Page 126 of 141

(https://biostat.wustl.edu/~adrc/cdrpgm/index.html) where 0 = no dementia , and scores 
of 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 = questionable, mild, moderate, or severe dementia, respectively.  The 
sum of boxes (i.e., CDR -SB)[ADDRESS_171361]- GS in  patients with mild dementia.   
8.3. ALZHEIMER ’S DISEASE ASSESSMENT SCALE – COGNITI VE SUBSCALE 12 (ADAS -
COG12) 
The ADAS -Cog9,10 is a psychometrician -administered battery comprised of several 
cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and 
spontaneous speech. The ADAS -Cog12 (which includes Delayed Word Recall) will be 
administered to all subjects  at various key visits throughout the study. 
8.4. NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INVENTORY (NPI)   
A study partner  interview, the 12- item NPI11 records frequency and severity of common  
neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia (Hallucinations, Delusions, 
Agitation/aggression, Dysphoria/depression, Anxiety, Irritability, Disinhibition, 
Euphoria, Apathy, Aberrant motor behavior, Sleep, and nighttime  behavior change, 
Appetite and eating change). The study partner  is then asked to rate their own distress 
for the subject’s behavioral symptoms occurring in the past 4 weeks.  
8.5. ALZHEIMER ’S DISEASE COOPERATIVE STUDY – ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING 
(ADCS -ADL -AD) 
The ADCS -ADL12 is a 23 -item study partner  questionnaire that covers both basic 
activities of daily living (ADL) (e.g., eating and toileting) and more complex ADL or 
instrumental ADL (e.g., using the telephone, managing finances, preparing a meal). 
8.6. COLUMBIA -SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE (C-SSRS)  
The C -SSRS13 is an assessment tool used to assess the lifetime suicidality of a subject 
(C-SSRS at baseline) as well as any new instances of  suicidality (C -SSRS since last 
visit).  
8.7. ZARIT BURDEN INTERVIEW  (ZBI)

database.   
9. EARLY DISCONTINUATION  
Subjects  may choose to discontinue study drug or study  participation  at any time,  for 
any reason,  and without prejudice. Moreover, a subject may be withdrawn at any time 
at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral or administrative 
reasons. Discontinued subjects should be followed according to medical practice 
standards, and the outcome documented. Follow -up is required if the subject is 
discontinued due to an adverse event (AE). Any comments (spontaneous or elicited) or 
complaints made by [CONTACT_149006][INVESTIGATOR_148974] ( CRF ) and source documents.  
The following must be completed  and documented in the source documents and 
CRFs  for all subjects  who discontinue the study early:  
• The reason  for early  study  discontinuation.   If the subject is withdrawn for more than 
one reason, each reason should be documented in the source documents and the most clinically relevant reason should be entered on the CRF. 
• Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature  and pulse), brief physica l and neurologic 
examination , weight , clinical  laboratory  tests,  ECG,  use of  concomitant 
medications  and adverse events should be obtained at discharge prior to release. 
• Blood draw for plasma  biomarkers  
• ADAS -Cog, MMSE, CDR, ADCS -ADL , NPI , ZBI and C -SSRS (as detailed in 
Section 7.1.6 – Early Termination Visit), if not performed within the last 3 0 days.  Page 128 of 141

 10. ADVERSE EVENTS/SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1. ADVERSE  EVENTS  - DEFINITION  
An Adverse E vent (AE)  is any undesirable  event  that occurs  to a subject during a  study, 
whether or not that event is considered  study drug-related. Monitoring for AEs will start 
at dosing. Examples include: 
• Any treatment- emergent  signs and symptoms (events that are marked  by a change 
from the  subject's baseline/entry  status [e.g., an increase in severity  or frequency of 
pre-existing  abnormality  or disorder])  
• All reactions from study  drug, an overdose, abuse of drug, withdrawal  phenomena, 
sensitivity  or toxicity  to study drug 
• Apparently unrelated  illnesses  
• Injury  or accidents (Note:  if a medical  condition is known to have caused  the injury  
or accident,  the medical  condition and the accident  should be reported as two separate 
medical events  [e.g., for a fall secondary to dizziness,  both "dizziness"  and "fall"  
should be recorded separately])  
• Extensions or exacerbations of symptoms, subjective subject -reported  events,  new 
clinically  significant abnormalities  in clinical laboratory, physiological testing  or 
physical examination  
 
All AEs,  whether or not related  to the study  drug, must  be fully  and completely  
documented on  the AE page of the CRF  and in the subject's clinical  chart.  
In the event that a subject  is withdrawn  from the study because of an AE, it must  be 
recorded  on the CRF  as such. The subject should be followed and treated  by [CONTACT_149028].  
The Investigator must  report all directly  observed AEs and all spontaneously reported  
AEs.  The Investigator will ask the subject a non- specific  question (e.g., "Have  you 
noticed anything  different since your dose of the study medication?")  to assess whether 
any AEs have been experienced  since the last assessment.  AEs will be identified  and 
documented in the Electronic Data Capture ( EDC) system  in appropriate medical  
terminology. The severity  and the relationship to the study drug will be determined  and 
reported in EDC (see below).  Page 129 of 141

Simufilam (PTI-125) FINAL  Version  1.0, JUNE 30, 2021 
 
Page 32 of 43     CONFIDENTIAL  
 10.2. ADVERSE EVENTS - SEVERITY RATING  
The severity  of each AE should be characterized  and then classified  into one of three  
clearly  defined  categories as follows: 
• Mild  – the AE does not interfere  in a significant manner with the subject's normal 
functioning level. It may be an annoyance. 
• Mode rate – the AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazar dous 
to health. It  is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
• Severe – the AE produces sign ificant  impairment  of functioning or incapacitation  
and is a definite  hazard  to the subject's health. 
These three  categories are based  on the Investigator's  clinical  judgment, which  in turn 
depends on  consideration  of various factors  such as the subject's report and the physician's 
observations. The severity  of the AE should be recorded in the appropriate section  of the 
EDC. 
10.3. ADVERS E EVENTS  – RELATIONSHIP TO  STUDY   DRUG 
The relationship  of each AE to the study drug will be classified  into one of three  defined  
categories as follows:  
• Unlikely  –   a causal  relationship between  the AE and the study drug is unlikely. 
• Possible –  a causal  relationship  between  the AE and the study drug is possible. 
• Probable – a causal  relationship between  the AE and the study drug is probable. 
For example,  the AE is a common adverse event known to occur  with the 
pharmacological class  of the study  drug; or the AE abated  on study drug  
discontinuation and reappeared  upon rechallenge with the study drug. 
These three  categories are based  on the Investigator's clinical  judgment,  which  in turn 
depends on consideration  of various  factors  such as the subject's report, the timing  of 
the AE in relationship  to study drug administration/discontinuation,  the physician's 
observations and the physician's prior experience.  The relationship  of the AE to the study  
drug will be recorded  in the appropriate section  of the EDC. 
10.4. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS - DEFINITIONS  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  includes (but is not limited  to) an experience occurring 
at any dose that results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life-threatening  event  (i.e., the subject  is at immediate  risk of death  from the  Page 130 of 141
Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI- 125-07 
Simufilam (PTI-125) FINAL  Version  1.0, JUNE 30, 2021

 reaction  as it o
ccurs).  "Life -threatening" does not include an event  that, had it 
occurred  in a more  serious form,  might have  caused  death. For example,  drug - 
induced hepatitis  that resolved without evidence of hepatic  failure  would  not be  
considered  life-threatening  even  though drug-induced hepatitis  can be fatal.  
• In-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], not an emergency  room  visit) or 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
• A persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  (i.e., a substantial  disruption of 
the subject's ability  to carry  out normal life functions). 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 
In addition, medical  and scientific  judgment should be exercised  in deciding whether 
other  situations  should be considered  an SAE  (i.e., important medical  events that may 
not be  immediately  life-threatening or result in death  but may jeopardize  the subject or 
may require  medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other  outcomes listed  
in the definition  above). Examples  of such medical  events include (but are not limited  
to): allergic  bronchospasm requiring  intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do not  result  in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or 
the development of drug dependency or drug  abuse.  
An unexpected AE is one for whi ch the specificity  or severity  is not consistent  with the 
current Investigator's  Brochure. For example,  hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected (by 
[CONTACT_149029])  if the Investigator's  Brochure listed  only elevated  hepatic 
enzymes  or hepatitis.  
Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism and  cerebral  vasculitis  would be unexpected (by 
[CONTACT_149030]) if the Investigator's  Brochure listed  only cerebral  vascular  
accidents.  
10.5. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING  
The reporting of SAEs  by [CONTACT_149010] (e.g., FDA)  is a 
regulatory  requirement.  Each  regulatory  agency has established  a timetable  for 
reporting SAEs  based  upon  established  criteria.  Likewise,  it is the responsibility  of 
the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_148975].  
All SAEs  must be reported  immediately  (within  24 h of learning  of the event)  by e-
mail to: 
Premier Research Global Pharmacovigilance

Cassava Sciences, Inc.  Clinical Protocol PTI- 125-07 
Simufilam (PTI-125) FINAL  Version  1.0, JUNE 30, [ADDRESS_171364]  also report such an event within  24 hours 
of being notified. Your  local  IRB may also require  these reports.  
In the event of  any SAE  (other than death),  the subject  will be instructed  to contact [CONTACT_8350] (Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461])  using the phone number provided  
in the Informed Consent  Form.  All subjects  experiencing  an SAE  will be seen by a 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_148976].  
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1. RANDOMIZATION  
Randomized treatments will be assign ed by [CONTACT_149011] a randomly generated 
numeric sequence.  
The randomization code will not be revealed to study subjects, I nvestigators, clinical 
staff, study monitors  or the Sponsor  until all subjects have completed therapy and the 
database has been finalized and locked.  
Under normal circumstan ces, the blind should not be broken. The blind may be broken 
only if specific emergency treatment is indicated . The date, time and reason for the 
unblinding must be documented in the CRFs , and the medical monitor must be informed 
as soon as possible.  
11.2. ANALY SIS POPULATIONS  
The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized subjects. All efficacy 
analyses will be conducted in this analysis set and subjects will be included in the group 
to which they were randomized. 
The Safety analysis set includes all subjects who receive study treatment. All safety 
analyses will be completed in the Safety analysis set and subjects will be included in the 
group based on the treatment actually received.  Page 132 of 141

 11.3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
11.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Each of the two co- primary endpoints will be analyzed using a linear mixed model for 
repeated measurements. The dependent variable is the change from baseline and the 
model will include fixed effects for treatment group (two  levels), week ( 5 levels, 
corresponding to Weeks 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52), the treatment group -by-week interaction, 
and the randomization stratification variable. The baseline value of the corresponding endpoint will be included as a covariate and the unstructured covariance model will be 
used. The Study Day [ADDRESS_171365] at the alpha = 0.05 level 
of significance. Study success requires that both co -primary comparisons are statistically 
significant.  
 
11.3.2 Secondary Analyses 
The iADRS
18,19 is a linear combination of scores from two well- established, widely 
accepted, therapeutically sensitive measures of AD: the ADAS -Cog and ADCS -iADL 
(the instrumental component of the ADCS -ADL). The iADRS has been validated and 
statistical properties of the composite performance have been described20. All items of 
the ADAS -Cog12 and the ADCS -iADL will be included to generate this primary efficacy 
composite measurement without additional weighting.  
 Secondary clinical endpoint data 
(iADRS, NPI, MMSE and ZBI) measured repeatedly will 
be analyzed using the same types of linear mixed models as described for the primary analysis.  
Plasma assays may include P -tau181, SavaDx and neurofilament light chain, and 
additional plasma biomarkers may be measured . All plasma biomarker  data involving 
repeated measures will also be analyzed using the same types of linear mixed models as 
described for the primary analysis.  
CDR- SB data will be analyzed using ANCOVA models with treatment group as a factor 
and the baseline value as a covariate.  
All s econdary analyses will be conducted using two- sided tests at the alpha = 0.05 level 
of significance, with no adjustments for multiplicity.  Page 133 of 141

Page 36 of 43     CONFIDENTIAL  
 11.4. SAFETY  ANALYSIS  
Adverse events reported  on case report forms  will be mapped  to preferred  terms  and 
organ  systems using the MedDRA mappi[INVESTIGATOR_16816].  Vital signs and clinical  laboratory  
results will be descriptively  summarized  in terms  of change from screening  values.  
11.5. SAMPLE SIZE 
Approximately seven hundred fifty (750) subject s will be enrolled  in this study. The 
sample  size was determined  by a power analysis of ADAS -Cog in a similar population 
over 52 weeks . This analysis determined that group sizes of 300 are powered to show a 
45% difference from placebo at 52 weeks with 90% power and a two- sided significance 
level of 0.05.  The power calculation assumes a true mean change from baseline for 
placebo of 5.[ADDRESS_171366] deviation of 8.5 points.  Assuming a drop- out of 
20%, each treatment group should enroll 375 subjects.  
12. STUDY TERMINATION 
The study will be terminated  following completion of the study or at any time at the 
discretion  of the  Sponsor. 
13. DATA COLLECTION,  RETENTION AND MONITORING  
13.1. CASE  REPORT FORMS

Title of S tudy: A Phase 2 Study of ALKS 4230 in Combination W ith Anti- PD-1 (Pembrolizumab) in 
Patients  With Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer Currentl y on Treatment 
With Anti -PD-(L)1 Without Having Achieved a Complete Remission  
Investigators:   (Coordinating Investigator) , other investigators at selected study site s 
Study Period (Y ears):  Approximately  [ADDRESS_275952] patient  enrolled: March [ADDRESS_275953] patient  completed: February 2021 Phase of D evelopment: 2  
 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To estimate the response rate to ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients 
with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC)  who have  previously received  
anti-programmed cell death protein 1 ( anti-PD-1) or anti- programmed cell death ligand -1 
(anti-PD-L1) (henceforth referred to as PD-[L]1) therapy but who have not achieved a 
complete remission ( CR). The primary obje ctive will be assessed  for the following 2 groups:  
− Group 1: Patients with stable disease (SD) , defined as ≥12 weeks of SD per Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, or patient s with partial 
response (PR) with no further reduction in tumor size or response (ie, PR and not 
improving further) for ≥8  weeks on prior anti -PD-(L)1 therapy  
− Group 2: Patient s with progressive disease (PD) with no prior response to anti- PD-(L)1 
therapy after ≥[ADDRESS_275954] response of SD or PR and after ≥8 weeks on anti- PD-(L)1 therapy 
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the duration of response  (DOR) , progression- free survival (PFS), time to 
progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) of  patient s with advanced or recurrent HNSCC 
receiving pembrolizumab plus ALKS 4230  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab plus ALKS 4230  
Exploratory: 
• To evaluate whether assessment of pretreatment biopsies from patients who have failed to 
achieve a CR on therapy with anti-PD-(L)1 can identify a subset of patient s who are likely 
to respond to the addition of ALKS 4230  
• To evaluate whether a second biopsy, , can identify changes 
in tumors
 that will predict response or failure to the addition of ALKS 4230

•  
Methodology: This is a multi -center , Phase 2, open- label therapy study  to assess the antitumor efficacy 
of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab in patient s with advanced, recurrent and/or 
metastatic HNSCC on treatment with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody without having achieved a CR.  
Study Design Schematic 1 
 
Pembrolizumab regimen: 200 mg once Q3W by [CONTACT_229375] 4230 regimen: 3 µg/kg, given daily on [ADDRESS_275955] week of each 
3-week treatment cycle . 
Abbreviations: CR=complete remission; HNSCC=squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; PD-
(L)1=programmed cell death ligand -1; PR=partial response; SD=stable disease; Q3W=every 3 weeks  
For analysis, patient s will be placed into 1 of the 4 cohorts based on their disease status as assessed at 
screening : 
• Cohort 1: SD ; defined as ≥[ADDRESS_275956] v1.1 criteria  
• Cohort 2: PR with no further reduction in tumor size or response for ≥8 weeks (ie, PR and 
not improving further)  
• Cohort 3: PD with no prior response to anti- PD-(L)1 therapy after ≥8  weeks on anti -PD-
(L)1; or  
• Cohor t 4: Progressive disease after prior achievement of a best response of SD or PR  and 
after ≥8 weeks on anti -PD-(L)1 therapy 
All patient s will be administered the combination of ALKS 4230 and pembrolizumab. For analysis, 
patient s in the  4 cohorts will be combined into 2 groups :  
• Group [ADDRESS_275957] of all patients with current SD or PR (Cohorts 1 and 2) who are not progressing or further demonstrating reductions in tumor size.  
• Group [ADDRESS_275958] of patients with PD (Cohorts 3 and 4). 
Patients in both groups (or all cohorts) will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W)  
by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion (Keytruda USPI ) and ALKS 4230 3 µg/kg, given daily on [ADDRESS_275959] a  pretreatment biopsy within 6 weeks of Cycle  (C) 1, Week 1, Day (D) [ADDRESS_275960]- treatment (second) biopsy  at C1D12, or any time from C1D8  through C1D19 , to assess whether the 
addition of ALKS 4230 to the treatment regimen alters the tumor microenvironment and what changes 
on therapy (immunopharmacodynamics) predispose to responses to the combination.

The study  plans to  enroll   patient s in total  . The number of patient s 
enrolled into each cohort within eac h group will be determined at the time of enrollment, based on the 
patient ’s response to previous treatment.  It will be at the discretion of Alkermes and the  Immune 
Oncology Network ( ION) to expand a particular cohort of interest.  
Study Design Schematic 2  
 
Abbreviations: IV=intravenous;  Q3W=every 3 weeks. 
Dose delays and modifications for adverse events ( AEs) related to  the ALKS 4230 + pembrolizumab 
combination regimen are described in the protocol. After recovery from an AE that meets dose hold  
criteria,  the patient may resume dosing at full dose of pembrolizumab and full or reduced dose of ALKS 
4230 in subsequent cycles , with consultation from the ION and Alkermes Medical Monitor s, or may 
discontinue from the study.
 
Patient s with tumors who  respond to treatment will continue until the following:  
• Confirmed progression occurs (upon agreement with the ION and Alkermes Medical Monitor s, 
patient s tolerating therapy and receiving clinical benefit may be allowed to stay on study for up 
to 1 year )  
• Until unacceptable toxicity occurs  
• Other criteria for discon tinuation occur 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed and reported using standard  Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v5.0 criteria. Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_229376] I nvestigator  
(PI), participating site PIs, the ION Co ordinating Center PI [INVESTIGATOR_57370], and representatives from 
Alkermes.

screening  
3. Antitumor activity as measured by [CONTACT_229379] y Assessments:  
• Adverse events  
• Physical examination and electrocardiogram findings  
• Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature)  
• Clinical laboratory parameters (ie, complete blood count with differential, complete serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis)  
Statistical Methods:  For all applicable parameters, descriptive statistics will be provided.  
Efficacy:  Response to treatment will be evaluated using both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors v1.1 and immune- related respons e criteria . For patient s with objectively measurable disease, 
response to therapy, DOR, PFS, and OS will be calculated.  
Primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated in the Efficacy Evaluable population (all patients who 
received at least 1 dose of both stu dy drugs) for each group separately and overall. The rate of objective 
improvement after continued anti- PD-1 therapy with ALKS  4230 will be summarized by [CONTACT_10609] (Group 
1 and Group 2) and overall population with descriptive statistics . The analysis of objective response 
using an exact binomial test will be conducted separately for each group and overall; the 95% 
confidence interval will be reported.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated in the Efficacy Evaluable population (Group 1 and Group 2). 
DOR  and TTP will be calculated and summarized by [CONTACT_229380]. PFS and OS curves will be 
plotted by [CONTACT_229381]- Meier (KM) approach. The median survival time (if 
applicable) and its 95% CI for PFS and OS will be reported. The PFS a nd OS rate s at 6 and 12 months 
will be estimated using the KM approach.  
The objective response rate will be summarized for each of the 4 cohorts.  
The percentage change from baseline in target lesions will be summarized by [CONTACT_229382].  
Safety:  The i ncidence of TEAEs will be summarized for the Safety Population, defined as all patient s 
who received at least 1 dose of investigational combination , each group and overall, by [CONTACT_926], and by 
[CONTACT_229383] . Sim ilar tables will be prepared for SAEs, 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation, as well as additional categories of AEs as defined in the SAP.  
Adverse event severity will be graded according to the CTCAE v 5.0 and terms recorded on the CRFs 
will be mapped to prefe rred terms using MedDRA  version 21. 
Results of clinical laboratory tests will be summarized by [CONTACT_229384]. Tables showing the shift from baseline will also be presented. ECG findings will be 
listed.  
Concomitant medications will be categorized and presented using the World Health Organization 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical drug classification system.

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Disease Overview 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer 
world wide (SEER database) . An estimated 61,000 new cases of HNSCC w ere diagnosed in 2016 
in the US alone, with  approximately 13,000 patient s dyin g of their disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_229357], the prognosis for patient s with HNSCC remains poor 
(Kamangar et al, 2006 ; Siegel et al, 2016) . Approximately two -thirds of HNSCC cases are 
diagnosed in advanced stages, although metastatic disease at presentation is uncommon ( Argiris  
et al, 2008; National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2016; Rothenberg and Ellisen 2012) . 
Recurrent and metastatic diseases are often refractory or unable to be treated with further surgery 
and/or radiation therapy (Colevas 2006; Specenier and Vermorken 2008) . The 5-year survival 
rate for later -stage disease is estimated to be 50% or less (Gregoire et al, 2010; Lefebvre 2005; 
Rousseau and Badoual 2012) . Metastatic  and recurrent HNSCC that is no longer amenable to 
local surgical/radiation therapy is associated with a high mortality rate and a median survival of 
6 to 9 months ( Lefebvre 2005; Vermorken et al, 2008) . First -line therapy with platinum- based 
therapy in combination with 5FU and cetuximab offers some palliation and efficacy but also high 
treatment -related toxicity. For patients with disease progression after  first-line therapy, or who 
are platinum  intolerant or platinum refractory, the anti -programmed cell death protein -1 (PD -1) 
antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have demonstrated substantial palliative benefits with durable tumor regressions noted.  
Pembrolizumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC 
with disease progression on or after platinum- containing chemotherapy , and this therapy is 
considered standard of care. Pembrolizumab was granted accelerated approval  in 2017 based on 
an overall response rate ( ORR ) of 16% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11, 22) and a complete 
response rate of 5% in a non-randomized study of 174 patient s with recurrent or metastatic 
HNSCC refractory to platinum- containing chemotherapy (Larkins et al, 2017) . Patients received 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W ; n=53) or the now standard regimen of 200 mg 
every 3 weeks ( Q3W ; n=121) ( Keytruda USPI ). Among the 28 responding patient s, the medi an 
duration of response (DOR) had not been reached (range 2.4+ to 27.7+ months), and t he ORR 
and DOR were similar irrespective of dosage regimen ( 10 mg/kg Q2W or 200 mg Q3W) or 
human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) status  (Keytruda USPI ). Subsequently, the efficacy of 
pembrolizumab was demonstrated in a single- arm stu dy of 177 platinum- and cetuximab -
pretreated HNSCC patient s who had an ORR of 16% (95% CI: 11, 23) with a median DOR of 
8 months (range 2+ to 12+ months ) (Bauml et al, 2017) . The open-label randomized Phase 3 
study, Keynote 040, in platinum- pretreated HNSCC patient s demonstrated that pembrolizumab 
narrowly failed to improve the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS)  compared to the 
Investigator’s choice therapy;  the study’s ORR  was 14.6% in the pembrolizumab arm vs 10.1% 
with the active comparator (hazard ratio  0.81, one-sided P=0.0204) ( Cohen et al, 2017) . 
Adverse reactions occurring in patient s with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in 
patient s with melanoma or non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the exception of increased 
incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 to 4) and new or worsening 
hypothyroidism (14.6%) (Larkins et al, 2017; Seiwert et al, 2016 ).

Protocol ION-01-ALKS  4230  CONFIDENTIAL  
ALKS 4230 is an engineered fusion protein composed of a circularly permuted interleukin ( IL)-2 
and IL -2 receptor ( R; IL-2R)-α designed to selectively activate the intermediate- affinity IL -2R, 
but not the high- affinity IL -2R. The intermediate -affinity IL -2R is expressed predominantly on 
effector lymphocytes, which play an important role in driving antitumor immune responses. In 
contrast, IL -2 preferentially activates the high -affinity IL -2R, driving the expansion of high-
affinity IL -2R-expressing cell types , including immunosuppressive CD4+ regulatory T cells 
(Tregs), which limit anticancer activity by [CONTACT_203843] -2 (ald esleukin).  
ALKS [ADDRESS_275989] for IL-2Rβ  and the common gamma chains, the two  chains that make up 
the intermediate -affinity IL -2R. This is the same receptor complex  stimulated by [CONTACT_8668] -15:IL-15Rα. 
Accordingly, ALKS 4230 functions in a fashion similar to IL -15, in that it activates  and expands 
CD8+ T cell and natural killer ( NK) cells in preference to other categories of T cells and 
lymphocytes. In early clinical data, both ALKS 4230 and IL-15 function as T- cell growth factors 
that both activate and induce expansion of T cells and NK cells. PD-1 blocking antibodies “unleash” T cells , including T cells that can recognize and kill tumor cells. Theoretically, the 
combination of a T-cell growth factor with an agent that “unleashes” T cells should be synergistic in patients with T cells capable of recogn izing and killing cancer cells. The synergy 
of anti- PD-1 and ALKS 4230 has previously been demonstrated in a murine model. The murine 
ortholog of ALKS 4230 delayed tumor growth in a subcutaneous B16F10 tumor model when used as monotherapy and in combination with anti- PD-1 (Losey et al, 2017 ). This study will test 
whether  patient s with  HNSCC treated with anti- PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) 
who have failed to achieve complete remission (CR) can achieve partial or complete tumor 
response by [CONTACT_229385] [ADDRESS_275990] demonstrated antitumor 
activity and established the efficacy, activity, and benefits with anti -PD-1 therapy in the 
recurrent metas tatic platinum-experienced HNSCC population, the response rates remain low, 
and the numbers of patients who relapse or fail to achieve CR remain in the high majority of 
85% or more. As patient s with HNSCC suffer tremendous morbidity and mortality with this  
disease, and the efficacy of any single-agent chemotherapy remains low with no proven salvage 
options in this population that fails anti PD -1 therapy, there is an exceptionally high unmet need 
to discover new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_229358], improve, or restore the responses to anti- PD-1 therapy.  
This study (ION-01-ALKS4230) will enroll patient s who have received prior anti- PD-1 antibody 
therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) as their last treatment or those receiving ongoing curr ent 
anti-PD-[ADDRESS_275991] not achieved a CR. Programmed cell death 
protein-1: programmed cell death ligand -1 (PD-L1) (henceforth referred to as PD -[L]1)  inhibitors 
are effective in small subsets of virtually every histologic type of canc er, yet most tre ated 
patient s fail to benefit. Moreover, many of the tumors that respond eventually relapse. Therefore, 
it is high ly likely that, in the near  future , patient s with stable disease ( SD) or progressing on anti -
PD-(L)[ADDRESS_275992] single category of patient s in the US. In the long- term 
follow-up analysis of the KEYNOTE-012 study of single agent pembrolizumab conducted in 192 patients with HNSCC, the objective response rate was 18% (95% CI, 13% to 24%) ( Mehra 
et al, 2018) . Among the subset of patients achieving a response, the median time to best response 
   
 Page 20 of 97  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ION-01-ALKS  4230  CONFIDENTIAL  
was 2 months (range, 2 to 17 months).  
 
 
 
 
Discerning the character of the tumors in patient s who  are not achieving complete regression on 
PD-(L)[ADDRESS_275993] likely to respond to anti- PD-1 are those with an increased 
number of mutations and thus abnormal proteins containing potentially immunogenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_229359] T cells capable of recognizing the abnormal proteins. Mechanisms by [CONTACT_229386]- PD-1 are not yet comprehensively defined
 
 
 Th
ere are likely to be many more redundant and 
non-redundant
 mechanisms of failure. Presumably, some mechanisms of failure will be rescued 
by [CONTACT_203844] 4230 (   ) and some will not.   
While
 it is not currently possible to hypothesize the frequency or proportion of each mechanism, 
we believe that biopsies from participants prior to a nd during therapy will provide insight into 
purported mechanisms of failure or success to generate hypotheses that will provide the foundation for future study design.  
Assessment of whether addition of ALKS [ADDRESS_275994]- treatment  (second) biopsy will be collected during We ek 2 (Cycle  [C] 1, 
Day [D] 12 or at any time from C1D8 through C1 D19). 
The study population designates patient s with advanced or recurrent HNSCC  who are either 
refractory and progressive on prior anti- PD-(L)[ADDRESS_275995] failed to obtain response or 
tumor regression to anti- PD-1 therapy for more than 8 weeks to receive ALKS 4230 in 
combination with pembrolizumab. Patient s in this population are as follows:  
Group 1 (Cohorts 1 and 2) will consist of all patient s with current SD (for at least 12 weeks) or 
partial response ( PR) with no further reduction in tumor size or response for ≥8 weeks (ie, PR 
and not further improving).  Group 2 (Cohorts 3 and 4) will consist of patient s with progressive disease ( PD) with no prior 
response to anti -PD-(L)1 therapy  after ≥8 weeks on anti- PD-(L)[ADDRESS_275996] response of SD or PR  and after  ≥8 weeks on anti- PD-(L)1 therapy.  
HNSCC was chosen due to the high unmet need in this difficult- to-treat patient  population with 
no effective therapeutic options for a number of reasons: 1) the demonstrated efficacy and recent 
approval of pembrolizumab for previously platinum- experienced recurrent or metastatic 
HNSCC, 2) the ease of serial biopsies in easily accessible sites of tumor in a proportion of patient s, and 3) the responses to the combination of ALKS 4230 and pembrolizumab being

readily and easily assessable.  However, if efficacy or response is observed, the combination 
could be tested in many different cancers.  
This study will be performed in collaboration with the Immune Oncology Network (ION), who 
will perform activities related to, but not limited to, oversight and management of clinical sites, 
medical monitoring, and laboratory analysis services. 
5.3. Dose Selection  
5.3.1. Pembrolizumab  
The pembrolizumab dose of 200 mg Q3W is the approved dose for the treatment of patient s with 
HNSCC (Keytruda USPI ). 
5.3.2. ALKS 4230 
All patient s in this study will be given ALK S 4230 at a daily dose of 3 µ g/kg for [ADDRESS_275997] -in-human (FIH) cl inical study with ALKS 4230 has been initiated and is currently 
ongoing (ALK4230- A101 ). This study is being conducted in patient s with advanced solid tumors 
who are refractory or intolerant to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_229360]. Patients are 
admin istered ALKS  4230 by a 30- minute intravenous ( IV) infusion daily for 5 days followed by 
[CONTACT_106623]- treatment period  (as described in the ALK4230-A101 protocol) in repeating cycles. 
Dosing is repeated every [ADDRESS_275998] previously received  anti-PD-(L)[ADDRESS_275999] not achieved a CR . The primary objective will be assessed  for the 
following 2 groups:  
• Group 1: Patient s with SD , defined as ≥12 weeks of SD per Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria , or patient s with PR with no further 
reduction in tumor size or response (ie, PR and not improving further) for ≥8 weeks 
on prior anti- PD-(L)1 therapy 
• Group 2: Patient s with PD with no prior response to anti- PD-(L)1 therapy after 
≥[ADDRESS_276000] response of SD or PR and after ≥8 weeks on anti- PD-(L)1 therapy. 
6.2. Secondary O bjectives  
• To evaluate the DOR , progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and 
OS of patient s with advanced or recurrent HNSCC receiving pembrolizumab plus 
ALKS 4230 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab plus ALKS 4230 
6.3. Exploratory Objective s 
• To evaluate whether assessment of pretreatment biopsies from patient s who have 
failed to achieve a CR on therapy with anti -PD-(L)1 can identify a subset of patient s 
who are likely  to respond to the addition of ALKS 4230  
• To evaluate whether a second biopsy, , can identify 
changes
 in tumors that will predict response or failure to the addition of ALKS 4230

8. STUDY DESIGN 
8.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
The study will assess the antitumor efficacy of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab 
in patients with advanced, recurrent , and/or HNSCC on treat ment with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody 
(pembrolizumab or nivolumab) without having achieved a CR.  
The study is a multi- center , Phase [ADDRESS_276018] received anti -PD-(L)1 therapy prior to enrollment in to the study . After enrollment in 
the study, ALKS 4230 with pembrolizumab will be administered to 4 cohorts of patient s with 
advanced, recurrent, and/ or metastatic HNSCC wh o have received  anti-PD-(L)1 therapy whose 
current response is as follows:  
• Cohort 1: SD , defined as ≥[ADDRESS_276019] criteria ;  
• Cohort 2: PR with no further reduction in tumor size or response for ≥8 weeks  (ie, PR 
and not improving further)  
• Cohort 3: PD with no prior response to anti- PD-(L)1 therapy  after ≥8  weeks on anti-
PD-(L)1, or  
• Cohort 4: Current PD after prior achievement of best response of SD or PR  and after  
≥8 weeks on anti- PD-(L)1 therapy  
Patient s will be administered the combination of ALKS 4230 and pembrolizumab. For 
simplification , the 4 cohort s of patient s will b e combined into 2 arms :  
• Group [ADDRESS_276020] of all patient s with current SD or PR (Cohorts 1 and 2) who are 
not progressing or further demonstrating reductions in tumor size.  
• Group [ADDRESS_276021] of patient s with PD ( Cohorts 3 and 4).  
Baseline tumor bio psy wil l be required at the time of study entry after screening procedures have 
been completed and  prior to first administration of  combination regimen  to assess each patient ’s 
tumor characteristics in an effort to identify patient s with tumors that may have limited 
pembrolizumab efficacy  or potential response to anti- PD-1/ALKS [ADDRESS_276022]- treatment  (second) biopsy at C1D12, or at any time from C1D8 
through C1 D19, to assess whether the addition of ALKS 4230 to the treatment regimen  alters the 
TME and what changes on therapy (immunopharmacodynamics) predispose to responses to the 
combination.  
The study plans to enroll  evaluable patients for Groups 1 and 2,  The 
number of pa
tients enrolled into each cohort within each group will be determined at the time of 
enrollment, based on the patient’s response to previous treatment It will be at the discretion of 
   
 Page [ADDRESS_276023] regimen of 200 mg flat dose IV 
Q3W . ALKS 4230 will be administered IV at a daily dose of 3 µg/kg, given daily on 
[ADDRESS_276024] week of each 3 -week treatment cycle .  
ALKS 4230 may be continued until toxicity develops. If a to xicity attributed to  ALKS  4230 
occurs , dosing for both pembrolizumab and ALKS 4230 will be held. After recovery from an AE 
that meets dose hold criteria, the patient  may resume at full dose of pembrolizumab and full or 
reduced dose of ALKS 4230 in subsequent cycles with consultation from the Medical Monitor or 
may discontinue from the study.  
 
 
Pati
ents with tumors who respond to treatment will continue until th e following: 
• Confirmed progression occurs (upon agreement with the ION and Alkermes Medical 
Monitors, patient s tolerating therapy and receiving clinical benefit  may be allowed to 
stay on study for up to 1 year)  
• Until unacceptable toxicity occurs  
• Other crit eria for discontinuation occur 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed and reported using standard Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE ) v5.0 criteria. Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_229390] (PI), participating site PIs, the ION Coordinating Center PI [INVESTIGATOR_57370], and 
representatives from Alkermes.  Details pertaining to the Safety Review Committee  (SRC), 
including participants, frequency of meetings, and criteria that would trigger ad hoc meetings, 
are described in the SRC Charter.  
If the unacceptable AEs (defined in Section  12.2)  observed are typi[INVESTIGATOR_229362]/or ALKS 4230 toxicities, the following will be  consider ed: (1) revising the protocol 
eligibility requ irements to decrease the likelihood of toxicities, (2) modifying the dose or 
schedule, or (3) allowing the study to proceed as designed assuming that patients in this study 
will have fatal diseases and few other treatment options. The risk/benefit ratio  will need to be 
evaluated in this situation.  
If unexpected, unacceptable AEs are considered to be related to concurrent administration of 
ALKS 4230 and pembrolizumab, the PI, participating site PIs, the ION Coordinating Center PI [INVESTIGATOR_57370], and representatives from Alkermes will consider revising the protocol eligibility 
requirements to decrease the likelihood of toxicities or may consider allowing the study to 
proceed as designed given the risk/benefit ratio for this population.

q TSH, cortisol, and ACTH should be measured at baseline and every other cycle (every 6 weeks). Cortisol should be measured in the morning.  
r The initial tumor imag ing will be performed within [ADDRESS_276039] dose of study drug. Scans performed as part of routine clinical manag ement are 
acceptable for use as the screening scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days prior to the firs t dose of study drug. Local reading 
(Investigator assessment with site RECIST radiology reading) will be used to determine eligibility and for patient management.  
s The first on -study imaging tim e point will be performed at 6 weeks (±7 days) after the first dose of study drug, then within 7 days prior to every second c ycle, 
or more frequently if clinically indicated. The same imaging technique should be used in a patient throughout the study. Loca l reading (Investigator assessment 
with site RECIST radiology reading) will be used to determine eligibility and for patient management.  
t In patients who discontinue study therapy without confir med disease progression, a radiologic evaluation should be performed at the time of treatment 
discontinuation (ie, date of discontinue ± 4 -week window). If a previous scan was obtained within 4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, then a scan at 
treatment discontinuation is not mandatory.  
u Baseline tumor tissue from an archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy (FNA not adequate) from patient s with oropharynx cancer  
must be tested locally for HPV status (if HPV status not known) prior to enrollment. Baseline tumor tissue from a newly obtained sample must also be provided 
to the CIML for PD -L1 biomarker testing (see Laboratory Manual for additional details). Newly obtained tissue may be obtained up to [ADDRESS_276040] -treatment (second) biopsy will be performed on the same or similar tumor site during the first cycle of therapy at C1D12, or at any time from C1D8

made during the patient ’s previous treatment with an anti -PD-(L)1 agent.  
8.3.4. Prior and Concomitant Medication Review  
At the time point( s) specified in  Table 4, prospective patient s will be asked about the 
medications they have taken in the last [ADDRESS_276046] the following data on all medications used by [CONTACT_102]: name, 
dose, regimen, route of administration, start and stop dates, and the indication for use.  
Prohibited medications are described in Section  8.4.2. 
8.3.5. Infusion -Type Reactions  
ALKS  4230 may be associated  with  infusion- type reactions.  Infusion reactions  should be treated  
at the discretion  of the I nvestigator.  The National Cancer Institute  CTCAE  v5.0 describes 
multiple types  of infusion reactions:  
1. Allergic reactions  
2. Anaphylaxis 
3. Cytokine release syndrome  
Patient s who  experience Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions  should not be rechallenged  with  
ALKS  4230.

Infusion-type reactions associated with the use of pembrolizumab should be managed in 
accor dance with the prescribing information for pembrolizumab ( Keytruda USPI ). 
8.3.6. Vital Signs  and Weight 
Vital signs (ie, weig ht, blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature) will be 
assessed at the time point (s) specified in  Table 4. Height will be measured at screening (Visit 1) 
only. Blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_229364] a seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes.  
8.3.7. Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at the time point (s) specified in  Table 4. For cycles 
that do not require a full physical exam per the study f low chart, the Investigator or qualified 
designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior  to study drug  
administration.  
8.3.8. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be conducted at the time point(s) specified in  Table 4.  
8.3.9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status

Accumulating evidence indicates that a minority of patient s treated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_229365] e of PD. Allowance to continue treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_229366] a 
transient tumor flare in the first few months after the start of immunotherapy but with subsequent 
disease resp onse. Patient s will be permitted to continue on treatment beyond initial RECIST 
v1.1- defined PD as long as they meet the following criteria:  
• Investigator- assessed clinical benefit and no rapid disease progression . 
• Patient  continues to meet relevant eligibility criteria, as determined by [CONTACT_229397] (or designee) in discussion with the Investigator. 
• Stable performance status . 
• Patient  is tolerating study treatment. 
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent 
serious complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases) . 
The decision to continue treatment beyond initial Investigator-assessed progression should be discussed with the ION and Alkermes  Medical Monitors (or designee) and documented in the 
study records. A follow-up scan should be performed at the next scheduled imaging evaluation 
6 weeks later to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size or continued PD. 
The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by [CONTACT_229398]. If 
the Investigator feels that the patient  continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_166862], then the patient  should remain on the study and continue to receive monitoring 
according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section  8.2), with consultation from the ION and 
Alkermes  Medical Monitors.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Definit
ions 
Evaluable for toxicity : All patient s will be evaluable for toxicity from the time  of consent.  
Evaluable for objective response: Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will 
be considered evaluable for response. These patie nts will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below. (NOTE: Patient s who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of C ycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response:  Patient s who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease. The respon se assessment will be  based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal 
progression of the lesions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease: For the purposes of this study, m easurable lesions are defined  according to 
RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_276052] be recorded in mm (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
NOTE: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable.  
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_14781] ( CT) scan (CT 
scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_109797] [ MRI ]), are considered as non- measurable.  
NOTE: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographicall y defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
 Page [ADDRESS_276053] diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement; in such  
circumstance, the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are t o be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions: All othe r lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or rare cases of unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations sho uld be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_229399](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged and are only assessable by [CONTACT_229400] . Methods allowable for disease 
evaluation ar e as follows: 
• Clinical examination : For skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. Clinical lesions 
will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, skin nodules and 
palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin 
nodules).  
• Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
• Conventional CT and MRI: A CT scan  may be used to measure the lesion if the CT 
slice thickness is [ADDRESS_276054] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations (eg,  for body scans).  For both scanning methods, 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease. The modality used at follow-up should be 
the same as was used at baseline, and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used, and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans sh ould be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
• Positron emission tomography ( PET)- CT: Combined PET-CT is not always of 
optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical 
 Page [ADDRESS_276055] (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion 
of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
Fluorodeoxyglucose (F DG)-PET: FDG -PET scanning is optional and may be used to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
1. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. 
2. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG- PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the 
positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the  date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing site 
of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
3. FDG -PET may be used to  upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]- specific medical literature for the indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
NOTE: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion mean s one that is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identifi ed by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154]. 
Cytolo gy and histology techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases 
(eg, residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign 
tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or SD is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or SD  (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and PD. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters.  
 Page 46 of 97  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ION -01-ALKS  4230  CONFIDENTIAL  
PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 
5 mm. (NOTE: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor  marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
NOTE: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient  to be considered in complete clinical response. 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persist ence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
PD: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or PI). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). The patient ’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  Best overall response is described 
in Table 8 for patients with measurable disease and in  Table 9 for patient s with non- measurable 
disease.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or PD is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that PD is objectively documented.  
Duration of SD : The duration of SD  is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria 
for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

8.3.12. Laboratory Correlative Studies 
Specimens will be collected for several planned correlative studies (summarized in Table 16)  at 
the time points specified in  Table 4. Many samples will be processed and stored, to be run in 
batches. When blood volume is limited , correlative studies  will be considered secondary t o tests 
needed to make clinical decisions. Also, testing  may be delayed or omitted if collecting the 
specimens may pose a danger to the patient , if samples cannot be processed or assayed , or if 
results are determined to be non -essential to achieving the objectives of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Correlative Studies With  Biopsies  
Collection of pretreatment tumor tissue (fresh biopsy via e xcisional , incisional, or core needle 
and large enough to show tissue architecture ) is mandatory; if collecting pretreatment tissue is 
not possible (eg , inaccessible or patient  safety concern), submission of archived specimen is 
possible upon agreement from the Sponsor. Obtaining a post-treatment (second) biopsy is 
mandatory in order to achieve protocol objectives and to study the TME post- treatment but may 
be by[CONTACT_229401]. Biopsy- based 
correlatives are considered exploratory. Prioritization of biopsy specimens will be made based on technical considerations that will be included in the Lab oratory Manual, total number of samples 
acquired, and feasibility of correlative study based on the above considerations.  
The pretreatment biopsy will be collected after all screening assessments have been performed 
and before the first dose of pembrolizumab and ALKS 4230 on Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1. The 
pretreatment specimen may be obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment 
on Day 1, provided study informed consent has been obtained or the biopsy was performed as part of routine patient care. The post- treatment (second) biopsy will be performed on the same or 
similar tumor site during the first cycle  of therapy at C1D12 or at any time from  C1D8 through

8.4.2. Prohibited Medications  and Supportive Care  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria ( Section  7.2) are not 
allowed during the ongoing study. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other 
medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study 
therapy or vaccination may be required. The Investigat or should discuss any questions about this 
with the ION and Alkermes  study team s. The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the Investigator and/or the patient’s primary physician. If a necessary supportive therapy or medication is a prohibited concomitant medication, as described in this 
section , then the patient  may continue in the study, coupled with appropriate monitoring by [CONTACT_229403]. 
Live vaccines are not recommended while on study. If the patient  has been on a stable dose of 
denosumab for at least 3 months, it is acceptable to continue denosumab or switch to zoledronic 
acid (Zometa
®), if possible. Study teams should verify with the local pharmacy that any 
concomitant medications given do not interact with the ALKS 4230 and pembrolizumab agents. 
All intercurrent medical conditions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according 
to acceptable community standards of medical care. All concomitant medications and treatments will be documented on the eCRF. 
Patient s are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_229371]:  
• Any other systemic antineoplastic therapy , including, but not limited to, cytotoxic  
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted agents, hormonal therapy (except luteinizing

Antipyretics are required throughout the ALKS 4230 treatment period. To reduce the potential for infusion-related fever or chills, premedication with an antipyretic agent (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  [NSAIDs]  and/or acetaminophen) is required at least [ADDRESS_276064], 
acetaminophen, meperidine, diphenhydramine, and/or other agents per the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
Because ALKS 4230 is a protein, there are no anticipated metabolic drug-drug interactions. 
Patient s who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_737], require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatm ents for clinical management should be removed from the study. Patients may receive 
other medications that the Investigator deems to be medically necessary.

9.1.2. Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle at a dose of 200 mg. Patient s will 
receive 1 dose of pembrolizumab Q3W  on an outpatient basis. Patient s will receive up to 1 year 
of pembrolizumab (17 cycles or 1 year  of treatment, whichever occurs later)  calculated from the 
date of first dose. There will be no option for retreatment with pembrolizumab alone following 
the completion of combination regimen  (a maximum of 17 cycles).  
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion Q3W. Sites should 
make eve ry effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. However, 
given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site,  a window of -5 minutes and

[IP_ADDRESS]. Events Considered Related to Pembrolizumab  
Adverse events associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic 
etiology. These AEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of 
treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug- related toxicities and severe or life-
threatening AEs. Refer to the Keytruda USPI [CONTACT_46140] r dose management of toxicities related to 
pembrolizumab.  
Pembrolizumab may be interrupted for situations other than treatment- related AEs, such as 
medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy. Patients should be 
placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption unless otherwise 
discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient ’s 
study record.

 Page [ADDRESS_276072] previously recei ved anti- PD-(L)[ADDRESS_276073] not achieved a CR . The primary objective will be assessed  for the 
following 2 groups:  
• Group 1: Patient s with SD , defined as ≥[ADDRESS_276074] v1.1 criteria, or 
patient s with PR with no further reduction in tumor size or response (ie, PR and not 
improving further) for ≥8 weeks on prior anti- PD-(L)1 therapy  
• Group 2: Patient s with PD with no prior response to anti- PD-(L)1 therapy after 
≥[ADDRESS_276075] response of SD or PR and after ≥8 weeks on anti- PD-(L)1 therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of new  or improved antitumor response ( hereafter 
referred to as objective improvement) after the addition of ALKS [ADDRESS_276076] not achieved a CR. 
Antitumor activity will be measured by [CONTACT_229405]. 
Antitumor response rate of subsets of patient s will be based on disease status (defined by [CONTACT_146212],  
SD, or PD based on RECIST v1.1, determined by [CONTACT_229406] ) at screening . 
An objective improvement for patient s within Group  1 (Cohorts 1 and 2) is defined as:  
• SD at screening that improves to PR or CR 
• PR at screening that improves to CR  
An objective improvement for patient s within Group 2 (Cohorts 3 and 4) is defined as : 
• PD at screening that improves to PR or CR 
Baseline scans must be completed  within 28 days before the start of treatment. Scans are to be 
completed according to the time points indi cated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4).  
Patient s whose response converts from PD or SD to PR or from PR to CR will have a 
confirmatory scan for tumor assessments 6 weeks after the response-defining scan. The reafter, 
timing of tumor assessments will depend on whether or not the patient  continues with study drug .

Pati
ents may receive study drug while waiting for confirmation of PD if they are clinically stable 
as defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Absence of signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) indicating 
disease progression  
• No decline in ECOG P erformance Status  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease  
• Absence of progressive tumor at  critical anatomical sites (eg , cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention  
11.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the DOR , PFS, TTP, rate of non-progression at 
6 months, and OS of patient s with advanced or recurrent HNSCC receiving pembrolizumab plus 
ALKS 4230 and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab plus ALKS 4230. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints in this study include: 
• DOR, PFS, TTP, rate of non-progression at 6 months, and OS  
• Antitumor response rate of subsets of patient s based on disease status (PR, SD, or 
PD) at screening  
• Antitumor activity as measured by [CONTACT_229405]  
11.3. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint s 
The exploratory objectives are:  
• To evaluate whether assessment of pretreatment biopsies from patient s who have 
failed to achieve a CR on therapy with anti -PD-(L)1 can identify a subset of patient s 
who are likely to respond to the addition of ALKS 4230 
• To evaluate whether a second biopsy, , can identify 
change
s in tumors predicting response or failure to the addition of ALKS 4230 
•

12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety will be assessed on the basis of:  
• Adverse events  
• Physical examination and ECG findings  
• Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature)  
• Clinical laboratory parameters  (ie, CBC with differential, complete serum chemis try, 
and urinalysis) 
12.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical investigation patient  who has 
been administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a 
causal relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory 
change that does not commonly occur in that patient and is considered clinically significant. 
Illnesses present prior to the patient  signing the informed consent form (ICF) are conside red to 
be preexisting conditions and are documented on the medi cal history eCRF. Preexisting 
conditions that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_737]. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and will be 
recorded as such on the eCRFs.  
Progressive disease is not considered an AE. Death due to PD is not considered an SAE (see 
Section  12.5.1) . Disease progression and outcome, as assessed by [CONTACT_737], will be 
recorded on the eCRF.  Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a patient  will be withdrawn from the study if a 
pregnancy occurs. As described in Section  8.4.1, the pregnancy, including a partner’s pregnancy, 
must be reported to Alkermes  in an expedited manner similar to an SAE ( Section  12.5) , and 
additional follow-up may be required.  
12.1.1. Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected nonserious and serious adverse events are also known as e vents of clinical interest 
(ECI) and must be reported within 24 hours to the ION Coordinating Center/Alkermes  within 
[ADDRESS_276077] be reported within 
24 hours to the ION Coordinating Center/ Alkermes  within 2 working days. 
  
 Page 73 of 97  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ION -01-ALKS  4230  CONFIDENTIAL  
The ECIs  for this study include: 
• An elevated aspartate aminotransferase or alanine ami notransferase laboratory  value 
that is ≥3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and an elevated total bilirubin laboratory 
value that is ≥2× ULN  and an alkaline phosphatase laboratory value that is <2× ULN , 
as determined by [CONTACT_13149]-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.  
NOTE: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of 
these criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional 
evaluation for an underlying etiology. 
12.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality, that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening . The patient  is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs . This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused  death  
• Requires inpatien t hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity (eg, a substantial disruption of 
a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Death secondary to PD is not considered an SAE.  Disease progression and outcome, as assessed 
by [CONTACT_737], will be recorded on the eCRF. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be imme diately life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182032], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the patient or patient  and may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above. 
Admission  to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_229373] t unit for a nonmedical reason (ie, social stay admission) 
during the study in the absence of untoward medical occurrence will not be considered as an 
SAE but will be captured as an AE.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment  of the relationship of study drug to each AE  will be reported on the appropriate 
source document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by [CONTACT_737] (or designated sub-
Investigator) according to his or her best clinical judgment. The criteria liste d in Table [ADDRESS_276078] be present to be indicative of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purpos es of 
the definitions listed in the table .

Abbreviation: AE=adverse event.  
12.3.1. Toxicity Management for Immune- related Adverse Events Associated with 
Pembrolizumab  
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly  after the first dose or several months after the 
last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than one body system 
simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce 
complications. Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be 
managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids, and/or other 
 Page 75 of 97  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ION -01-ALKS  4230  CONFIDENTIAL  
supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude 
other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, and skin biopsy 
may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or 
discontinue the ALKS 4230 + pembrolizumab combination regimen  and administer 
corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with 
pembrolizumab are provided in Table 14.

12.4. Monitoring and Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse event data collection will begin after a patient  signs the ICF and will continue until 
completion of the Safety Follow-up Visit for the main part of the study. Long- term collection of 
AE data is described in Table 5. Any AE or SAE having an onset after the Safety Follow -up 
Visit will not be collected or reported unless the Investiga tor feels that the event may be related 
to the study drug. 
The Week 3 AE review can be captured via telephone; no visit is required. 
Patient s will be instructed by [CONTACT_203871]. All 
volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on t he AE eCRFs.  
The Investigator will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the study drug(s) (see 
Section  12.3) , the intensity (severity) of the event, action t aken, and patient  outcome. For AEs 
not clearly related to either ALKS [ADDRESS_276080] conservative 
approach to treating the event should be used. 
 Page 81 of 97  

  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ION -01-ALKS  4230  CONFIDENTIAL  
The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (sever ity): 
• Mild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities  
• Severe:  Is incapacitating; results in inability to work or perform usual activities  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by [CONTACT_737] , or until the 
patient  is deemed by [CONTACT_16781]-up. 
Immune- mediated AEs  will be documented as such  using the immune -mediated AE eCRF . 
For clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the ALKS [ADDRESS_276081] be reported to Syneos Drug Safety immediately , within 
24 hours  of discovery, by [CONTACT_229408]:

If this relationship is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug, 
evidence to support this assessment must also be provided. 
The written report for pregnancies in female patients and in female partners of male patient s 
should be submitted on the Pregnancy Report Form provided for this purpose. 
12.5.1. Protocol -specific Exemptions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Any event that indicates disease progression will not be reported to Alkermes as described in this 
section, including death secondary to disease progression, unless there is evidence suggesting a 
causal relationship  between the drug and the event. If there is such a causal relationship, then the 
event will be submitted to the ION Coordinating Center/Alkermes within 24 hours.

The ION Coordinating Center/ Alkermes  will monitor aggregated efficacy endpoint events and 
safety data to ensure the safety of  the patient s in the study . Any serious suspected events  that, 
upon review, are not determined to be progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to 
the ION Coordinating Center/ Alkermes  within 24 hours. 
12.5.2. Reporting of Pregnancy Events 
Although pre gnancy and lactation are not considered AEs  under this protocol , it is the 
responsibility of Investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a patient  
(spontaneously reported to them) that occurs during the study. 
Pregnancies and l actations that occur from the time the patient  is enrolled (including pregnancies 
in the female partners of male patient s) through [ADDRESS_276082] be reported as SAEs (Important Medical Events). If the 
pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the ION Coordinating Center or Alkermes .

13.1. Sample Size Considerations 
This study plans to enroll  efficacy eval uable patients in Groups 1 and 2,  
In the long-term follow-up analysis of the KE YNOTE-012 trial of single agent pembrolizumab, 
which was conducted in 192 patients with HNSCC , the objective improvement rate was 18% 
(95% CI, 13% to 24%) ( Mehra et al, 2018 ). Among the subset of pa tients achieving a response, 
the median time to objective improvement was 2 m onths (range, 2 to 17 months).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13.2. General Statistical Methodology 
The statistical analysis methods are described be low. Additional details will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to be finalized before  database lock. 
In general, summary statistics (n, mean, sta ndard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for 
continuous variables, and number [%] of patients in each category for categorical variables) will 
be provided by [CONTACT_229409]. Time-to- event variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_5263]-
Meier plots, medians, and ranges. The data will be tabulated and analyzed with respect to patient 
enrollment and disposition, demographic and ba seline characteristics, prior and concomitant 
medications, efficacy, and safety measures.  
Source data for the summary tables and statistical  analyses will be presented as patient data

The Safety population, defined as all patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_276083] v1.1 and immune -related response 
criteria ( irRC ). For patients  with objectively measurable disease, response to therapy, DOR , PFS , 
and OS  will be calcu lated.  
13.4.1. Primary Efficacy  Endpoints  Analysis 
Primary effic acy analysis will be evaluated i n patient s in the Efficacy Evaluable population for 
each group separately and overall . The objective improvement rate (as defined in Section  11.1)  
after continued anti- PD-1 therapy with ALKS  4230 will be summarized by  [CONTACT_19313] (Group 1 and 
Group 2) separately and overall  with descriptive statistics.  The analysis of objective response 
rate using a n exact  binomial test will also be  conducted separately for each  group. 
The 95% CI  on the objective improvement rate will be reported. Similar approaches will also be 
applied to the overall population. 
13.4.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
Secondary efficacy analysis will be evaluated on  the Efficac y Evaluable patients.  
DOR and TTP will be calculated and summarized by [CONTACT_229380]. Patients with missing 
response data will be considered non-responders and excluded from the DOR analysis. PFS and 
OS curves will be plotted by [CONTACT_229381] -Meier approach. The median 
survival time (if applicable) and its 95% CI for PFS and OS will be reported. The PFS and OS 
rate at 6 and 12 months will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier  approach. 
The objective response rate will be summarized f or each of the 4 cohorts. 
The percentage change from baseline in target lesions will be summarized by [CONTACT_229380].

tests,  and ECG findings. Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA®) version 21 preferred terms and system organ classes.  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs)  are defined as any AE that begins on or after the first 
administration  of the study drug. Adverse event severity will be graded according to the CTCAE 
v5.[ADDRESS_276084] recent 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (Med DRA).  
All AEs will be listed. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized for each group and overall, 
by [CONTACT_926] , and by [CONTACT_229383] . The summary 
tables will include the number and percent age of patient s with T EAEs overall, by [CONTACT_70244], and by [CONTACT_229410].  Similar tables will be prepared for 
SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, as well as additional categories of AEs as defined in the SAP.  
Results of clinical labor atory tests will be summarized by [CONTACT_229411]. Tables showing the shift from baseline will also be presented. 
ECG findings will be listed.  
Concomitant medications will be categorized and presented using the Wor ld Health  Organization  
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (WHO -ATC) drug classification system.

14.1. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limited to, reviewing eCRFs for accuracy and 
completeness)  will be performed by [CONTACT_229412].  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
By [CONTACT_12142], the Investigator agrees that, within local regulatory restrictions and 
institu tional and ethical considerations, authorized representatives of Alkermes, a regulatory 
authority, or an institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) may visit 
the site to perform audits or inspections, including the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug 
accountability records, patient  charts and source documents, and other records relative to study 
conduct. The purpose of an Alkermes audit or inspection is to systematically and independently 
examine study -related activities and documents (eg, laboratory reports, X- rays, workbooks, 
patients’ medical records) to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data recorded, analyzed and accurately reported, according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH), and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_182118] a regulatory agency 
regarding an inspection. 
14.3. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The Investigator must obtain IRB/IEC approval for the investigation. Initial and subsequent  
IRB/IEC approvals , as well as all materials approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC for this study, including 
the patient  consent form and recruitment materials, must be maintained by [CONTACT_229413]. 
 Page [ADDRESS_276086] be based on source documents or approved to be 
the original data (ie, data directly reported on the eCRF). All eCRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_229414]. 
The Alkermes Monitor or designated representative will review all source records on -site and 
compare them to the data collected on the eCRF.   
15.2. Confidentiality of Data  
By [CONTACT_12570], the I nvestigator affirms to Alkermes that he or she will maintain in 
confidence information furnished to him or her by [CONTACT_182120]. Please refer to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA) for details.

16. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
16.1. Ethics Review  
The clinical site’s IRB/IEC must meet all relevant regulatory requiremen ts. The study protocol 
and ICF will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC prior to enrolling patient s into the study; written 
approval from the committee must be received by [CONTACT_229415]. The protocol must be reapproved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC upon receipt of amendments 
and annually, as local regulatory requirements require.  
The Investigator is responsible for submitting all protocol changes and SAE reports to the 
IRB/IEC according to local procedures. At a minimum, all SAEs requiring an investigational 
new drug safety report must be immediately reported.  
All relevant correspondence from the IRB/IEC will  be forwarded by [CONTACT_12566] a timely fashion. 
16.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will b e conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Guideline E6, and all 
applicable local regulatory requirements. Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and 
scientific quality standard used for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies 
involving the participation of human patient s. Alkermes is committed to complying with this 
standard to provide assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study patient s will be 
protected, consistent with the principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
16.3. Written Informed Consent  
The Investigator (or authorized designee) at each center will ensure that the patient  (or the 
patient ’s legal representative) is given full and adequate oral and written information about the 
nature, purpose, and potential risks and benefits of the study. Each prospective patient  will 
receive an IRB-approved  ICF that summarizes the pertinent study information and will be given 
ample time to read the form and ask questions about the study. All info rmation is to be provided 
in a language understandable to the patient  and must not include any language that waives the 
patient ’s legal rights. Prospective patient s must also be informed of their right to withdraw 
consent without prejudice at any time during the study. If the patient  chooses to participate, he or 
she must sign the ICF before any study- specific procedures are conducted.  
All patient s will be informed of their rights to privacy and will be made aware that the study data 
will be submitted to A lkermes,  ION, the IRB, the contract research organization ( CRO ), if 
applicable, and to regulatory authorities for review and evaluation for the duration of the study 
and until the project has been approved for marketing or is withdrawn from investigation. They will also be informed that the Study Monitor may inspect their medical records to verify the 
accuracy and completeness of the study records and results.  
Significant changes to the protocol or product safety information may require a revision of the ICF, which must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201], and then signed by [CONTACT_229416].  
 Page [ADDRESS_276087] maintain 
the original signed ICF in the patient ’s source documents. A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to the patient .

17. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_182035]; please refer to the CSA for further details. 
17.1. Data Capture  
As stated in Section  15.1,  this study will use eCRFs for capturing data. All entries, corrections, 
and alterations will be made by [CONTACT_12556]. All data entrie s will be verified for accuracy and correctness by [CONTACT_12557]. The electronic 
data capture (EDC) system maintains a full audit trail.  
A copy of all laboratory reports will remain with the source documents at the study site. All electronic source data collected outside of the eCRF, such as e- diaries  or centrally  reviewed 
patient  data will be transferred directly to the EDC or to Alkermes for incorporation into the final 
datasets. All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically sign ificant or not 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_737]. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and will be recorded as such on the eCRFs.   
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA version 21. Concomitant medications will be categorized us ing the WHO -ATC drug classification system.  
17.2. Inspection of Records  
Alkermes or its representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow 
the Monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, patient  charts or electronic medical records and source documents, and other records relative to 
study conduct. 
17.3. Retention of Records 
Retention and storage of al l essential clinical study documents shall be governed by [CONTACT_229417]’s CSA and in accordance with ICH guidelines/local regulatory requirements as follows: 
Essential documents should be retained until at least [ADDRESS_276088]. These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_203890]. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the I nvestigator/institution as to when 
these docu ments no longer need to be retained. 
Patient s’ medical files should be retained in accordance with the applicable legislation and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution, or private

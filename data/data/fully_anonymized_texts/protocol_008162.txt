Since this is a preliminary exploratory study, there are no specific hypotheses to be tested. 3.0 Background 3.1 Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI) as the leading cause of death and acquired disability in children, with an estimated 700,000 childhood TBI cases every year in the [LOCATION_002].1-4 Defined as a disruption in the normal function of a child’s brain that can be caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head, or a penetrating head injury, childhood TBIs often result in significant impairment in cognitive functions,1 particularly in executive functions (EFs) due to the

First, implementation of broad-spectrum EF training programs is both costly for families and resource-demanding for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].[ADDRESS_1164943] children’s long-term rehabilitation outcomes by [CONTACT_838634], especially for follow-up sessions after discharge. Fourth, partially due to the lack of variety and richness, existing EF interventions are often limited in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_838619].9 3.2 Describe any relevant preliminary data. The NCH Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit admits an average of 30 children with TBI (ICD-9 codes: 803, 850, 851, 854; no deaths, no asphyxia) annually. A five-year review of records shows that 80% (24 children/year) or more are eligible to participate in the proposed K99 study. Open-end feedback from patients and families at NCH suggested broad interest in participating in the study. Our target 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Virtual Reality-based Rehabilitation for Children with Traumatic Brain Injuries 
 Page 4 of 23 HRP-503  v.12.10.18 sample size (N=30) is reasonable for an 18-month recruitment period. Recruitment will be monitored during the study. Additionally, we have recruited two pediatric patients with TBI from the NCH rehabilitation unit who pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-tested the VICT program and the pre- and post-intervention measures. Both patients and their family and clinicians expressed high enthusiasm and satisfaction with the intervention. 3.3 Provide the scientific or scholarly background for, rationale for, and significance of the research based on the existing literature and how will it add to existing knowledge. Virtual reality (VR) offers an exciting alternative EF rehabilitation strategy for three reasons. First, VR technology has the capability to offer a multitude of activities for training children with TBI in core EFs8 within a versatile virtual environment. Such an enriched, immersive environment has already been shown effective in promoting structural and functional recovery of the human brain.[ADDRESS_1164944] VR-based EF training to exert two positive effects on children’s rehabilitation22: (1) improved adherence. VR-based EF training was found especially appealing to pediatric patients in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], possibly due to the youth population’s increasing exposure to electronic games in recent years; (2) potentially better skill transfer to real life. Although research suggests mixed results of computerized training for cognitive skills in general, we expect VR training to translate trained skills into daily EF skills and overall QoL in pediatric TBI patients because (1) EFs are domain-general cognitive skills that can be gained in one setting and transferred to another;23 (2) studies using representative national samples of children have supported EF as domain-general skills and documented positive relations between EFs and real-life outcomes,24 and (3) Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_838620] (although this preliminary result should be interpreted with caution given that the changes could reflect other factors, such as natural recovery). The overall goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a VR-based interactive cognitive training (VICT) program in children 7-17 years with complicated mild  to

Finally, findings from this project are expected to inform future development of a comprehensive VR-based cognitive rehabilitation program to help children with TBI achieve a healthy and productive life post-injury.

The primary study endpoint is the protocol feasibility (defined as protocol completion rate and subjective VR experience ratings) and safety (see section 4.2) of the VICT program. The second study endpoint is the preliminary efficacy of the VICT program, defined as the changes in NIH Toolbox Composite Scores before and after the intervention. 4.2 Describe any primary or secondary safety endpoints. The primary safety endpoint is the number of adverse events. The secondary endpoint is the scores on participants’ simulator sickness and exertion. 5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent 5.1  Description:  The hardware of the VICT program consists of a fully-immersive High Tech Computer (HTC) VIVETM VR viewer (OLED display with 2160×1200 resolution, 90Hz refresh rate, and 110 degrees of field of view) powered by a high-performance laptop (Dell AlienwareTM 17), a pair of surround sound headphones reworked to integrate with the VR viewer, and a wireless one-hand controller for the child to interact with the virtual environment using gestures. Furthermore, to avoid the burden of the equipment’s weight on a child’s head, we created a special mechanical arm to suspend the VR viewer in front of a child’s eyes with adjustable headphone positions. With the system securely fixed on a wheeled workstation, a child can operate the program by [CONTACT_838635]/wheelchair in his/her own patient room. To ensure the hygiene, each child will use a new facial pad for the viewer and a pair of new earphone covers. All parts of the equipment will be sanitized with germicidal wipes after each use.   For the software, the Windows 10-based VICT program invites children to rescue an animated character named “Lubdub” from a castle. The program consists of three challenging and child-friendly tasks that correspond to the three core EFs. During the game, children need to (1) direct a group of sentinels away from the castle gates (VR Task #1, adapted from the Spatial Stroop Task to train Inhibitory 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Virtual Reality-based Rehabilitation for Children with Traumatic Brain Injuries 
 Page 8 of 23 HRP-503  v.12.10.18 Control), (2) successfully open a series of castle gates by [CONTACT_838636]/backward order (VR Task #2, adapted from the Visual Working Memory Task to train Working Memory), and finally (3) rescue Lubdub inside the castle by [CONTACT_838637] (VR Task #3, adapted from the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task to train Cognitive Flexibility). A tutorial mode preceding the training lets children learn how to interact with VR. In the training mode, children will complete each task starting at the easiest level and gradually moving to more difficult levels as easier levels are mastered. Each training session consists of 10-30 trials per task, taking about 15 minutes in total. Children will receive visual/audio feedback to learn and optimize their performance.  6.0 Procedures Involved* The procedure involved for the study is described in detail below:  1) Baseline assessment. All approximately 30 children will complete the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery tests, CPT 3, Virtual Reality Assessment, and the TBI-QOL Short Form prior to the randomization sequence. Both the assessor and the child will be unaware of group assignment at this point. Additionally, data regarding baseline measurement including proportion of planned baseline measures that are completed and the duration of each assessment will be documented.   2) Intervention. Following the baseline assessment, the approximately 30 children will be randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: intervention group (VICT training) or control group (a comparable VR game without cognitive training). The random allocation sequence will be generated using a SAS-based randomization program with 1:[ADDRESS_1164947] been discharged, this arrangement has unique advantages over a fixed length of training in that: a) it provides consistency with standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_838623], ensuring intervention to meet children’s medical needs; and b) it ensures consistent timing and sufficient retention rates for future assessment.  Additionally, AEs and SAEs will be monitored in real-time throughout the intervention. Quantitative user feedback such as sickness, fatigue, and time estimates will be measured at the end of both the first and the last VR session. The 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Virtual Reality-based Rehabilitation for Children with Traumatic Brain Injuries 
 Page [ADDRESS_1164948] VR session on children’s perceived VR experience, benefits, and challenges.   3) Post-intervention assessment. At completion of intervention, all children will again complete the NIH toolbox Cognition Battery tests, the Conners CPT 3, the Virtual Reality Assessment, and the TBI-QOL Short Form with trained staff blinded to the intervention assignment. Data regarding post-intervention measurement including proportion of planned post-intervention measures that are completed and duration of each assessment will also be documented.   4) Follow-up assessment. All children will complete a follow-up assessment within approximately 6 months after intervention completion. Clinically, this gives the child and family a long enough time to identify cognitive and behavioral problems. Research staff blinded to group assignment will administer the NIH Toolbox tests, the Conners CPT 3, the Virtual Reality Assessment, and the TBI-QOL Short Form to children at this visit. Children will complete the child-PedsQL Generic Core Scales and their parents or legal guardians/representatives will complete the BRIEF2, CBCL-APS, and parent-PedsQL. Data regarding follow-up measurement including proportion of planned follow-up measures that are completed and duration of each assessment will be documented. Data regarding recruitment including number of children screened per month; number of children enrolled per month; proportion of eligible children who enroll, and treatment-specific retention rates will be documented throughout the study and aggregated at this stage.  7.0 Data and Specimen Banking* 7.[ADDRESS_1164949] the data to be stored or associated with each specimen. 7.3 Describe the procedures to release data or specimens, including: the process to request a release, approvals required for release, who can obtain data or specimens, and the data to be provided with specimens. 8.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects* 8.1 Describe whether results (study results or individual subject results, such as results of investigational diagnostic tests, genetic tests, or incidental findings) will be shared with subjects or others (e.g., the subject’s primary care physicians) and if so, describe how the results will be shared. Individual subject results will not be shared with subjects or others. Study results in aggregated forms may be published in peer-reviewed

The assessment visits last approximately [ADDRESS_1164951] of the intervention, we do not set an upper limit of the intervention length, which could depend on patient’s preference and patient’s length of stay (if inpatient). We expect the total duration of subject’s participation to last up to six months (depending on how far out the subject’s follow-up appointment is scheduled upon completion of intervention). • The duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects. o Approximately 24 months  • The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study (complete primary analyses) o August 31, 2021 10.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria* 10.[ADDRESS_1164952]. Staff will ensure children are awake, alert, and able to sign the assent form (if ≥ 9 years) and demonstrate understanding of the study before being approached for consent. In addition, a trauma registry request will be performed monthly to identify TBI patients discharged within the last 3 months. These patients, if eligible, will be mailed a study invitation, followed by [CONTACT_838638]. Additional recruitment of discharged patients will be performed at follow up appointments using study flyers. Patients may also self-refer from the public domain through postings on sites such as clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and via IRB approved recruitment emails.

Inclusion criteria are as follows: 1) diagnosed with TBI (ICD-9 codes 803, 850, 851, or 854) and between 7 to 17 years old (inclusive) when admitted; 2) lowest post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)=13-15 combined with trauma-related abnormalities on neuroimaging or a depressed skull fracture (complicated mild TBI, CDC/NIH definition), GCS=9-12 (moderate TBI, CDC/NIH definition), and GCS=3-8 (severe TBI, CDC/NIH definition); 3) fluent in English-based communication; and 4) Physicians note closest to time of enrollment does not include information on agitation; or if under observation for agitation, currently score <28 on the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS), indicating mild to no agitation. To minimize the possibility of confounding by [CONTACT_838639], the following exclusion criteria are set, as consistent with existing literature: 1) severe physical/visual/cognitive comorbidities secondary to TBI that prevent proper utilization of a VR-based game and valid administration of the study measures; 2) premorbid neurological disorder or neurodevelopmental issues prior to injury that prevent proper utilization of a VR-based game and valid administration of the study measures; and 3) patients who are restricted from using electronic gaming devices. 10.3 Indicate specifically whether you will include or exclude each of the following special populations: (You may not include members of the above populations as subjects in your research unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.) • Adults unable to consent: No • Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers): Yes, this study will include children and adolescents 7-17 years old • Pregnant women: No • Prisoners: No 11.0 Vulnerable Populations* 11.[ADDRESS_1164954] their rights and welfare. Using electronic medical records and working with medical colleagues located in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], trained research staff will identify potential participants admitted to NCH with a complicated mild, moderate, or severe TBI. Once identified as eligible to participate, research staff will approach legal guardians and eligible children on

 Page [ADDRESS_1164955]. Staff will ensure children are awake, alert, and able to sign the assent form (if ≥ 9 years) and demonstrate understanding of the study before being approached for consent.   In addition, a trauma registry request will be performed monthly to identify TBI patients discharged within the last 3 months. These patients, if eligible, will be mailed a study invitation, followed by [CONTACT_838638]. Additional recruitment of discharged patients will be performed at follow up appointments using study flyers. Patients may also self-refer from the public domain through postings on sites such as clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and through IRB approved recruitment emails. Discharged patients will be offered the opportunity to return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838624].   Consent and assent will be obtained at an in-person meeting. Children will only be approached if the subject is interested in learning more about this research after initial study introduction. The researchers will ensure that the subjects understand that participation is voluntary and will not affect any treatment he/she may receive in the current or future visits.    Link information between study data and patient identification information will be kept separately from the study data and stored on a secure server in a password protected file on a password protected computer located in the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838625]. 12.0 Local Number of Subjects 12.1 Indicate the total number of subjects to be accrued locally. The study will recruit approximately 30 children with complicated mild, moderate, or severe TBI at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 13.[ADDRESS_1164956] 2020, researchers from NCH Center for Injury Research and Policy will work with colleagues throughout various departments/units across the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Inpatient Rehab Unit, Neurosurgery Inpatient Unit, etc.) to identify and approach potential participants admitted to NCH. Other potential participants already discharged will be identified through trauma registry data and mailed invitation letters followed by [CONTACT_838638]. Additional recruitment of discharged patients will be performed at follow up appointments using study flyers. Patients may also self-refer from the 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Virtual Reality-based Rehabilitation for Children with Traumatic Brain Injuries 
 Page 13 of 23 HRP-503  v.12.10.18 public domain through postings on sites such as clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and through IRB approved recruitment emails. These participants will also be sent the study letter and receive an introduction phone call if they are interested. Once participants have been identified as appropriate for the VR intervention, the research associates will explain and consent the legal guardian and assent the patient if they are [ADDRESS_1164957] any treatment he/she (or their child) may receive in the current or future visits. The legal guardian will give consent for this research, and his/her child will give assent if age >=9 years. 13.2 Describe the source of subjects. All inpatient and outpatient departments/units at NCH with patients with TBI, including but not limited to Inpatient Rehab Unit, Neurosurgery Inpatient Unit, Outpatient Rehab Unit, Neurosurgery Outpatient Unit. Patients may also be identified through trauma registry data. Participants may also self-refer from the public domain through postings on sites such as clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and through IRB approved recruitment emails. 13.3 Describe the methods that will be used to identify potential subjects. Researchers from NCH Center for Injury Research and Policy will work with colleagues throughout various departments/units across the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Inpatient Rehab Unit, Neurosurgery Inpatient Unit, etc.) to identify and approach potential participants admitted to NCH. Other potential participants already discharged will be identified through trauma registry data and mailed invitation letters followed by [CONTACT_838638]. Additional recruitment of discharged patients will be performed at follow up appointments using study flyers. Patients may also self-refer from the public domain through postings on sites such as clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and through IRB approved recruitment emails. 13.4 Describe materials that will be used to recruit subjects.

Phone, SMS, and email reminders will also be sent prior to the scheduled appointments. 13.5 Describe the amount and timing of any payments to subjects. Children will be paid $30 for completing Visit 1 (pre-intervention assessment), $40 for completing intervention/training and Visit 2 (post-intervention assessment), and $50 for completing Visit 3 (follow-up assessment). Parents will be paid $50 for completing Visit 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Virtual Reality-based Rehabilitation for Children with Traumatic Brain Injuries 
 Page 14 of 23 HRP-503  v.12.10.18 3 (follow-up assessment). All incentives will be paid through Greenphire ClinCards. Patients who come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_838626] a parking pass free of charge. Patients/parents will sign receipts for both receiving the ClinCard and the parking pass (if applicable). 14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*  The research is expected to pose minimal safety/toxicity concerns to subjects. If a subject verbally or behaviorally indicated motion sickness, VR side effects, or other discomfort, he/she will be provided with the option to withdrawn from the study upon request. Medical care will be provided at the direction of the attending physicians/nurses.  If more than 20% of subjects report SAEs due to the study procedures, the researchers will stop the study protocol, re-evaluate and revise the protocol, re-submit it for IRB approval, before resuming participant recruitment 15.0 Risks to Subjects* We believe that there is minimal risk for being in this study. It is possible that the subject might feel motion sickness using the virtual reality goggle. They might also experience other virtual reality side effects, which can include but are not limited to, blurry vision, eye strain, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, or nausea. The subject has the right to terminate using the virtual reality goggle any time during the study if there is any discomfort arising from using the virtual reality goggle. The risk of motion sickness will be minimized by [CONTACT_838640]. Although we will take every precaution including secure data storage on password-protected computers and REDCap, there is a small chance of loss of confidentiality of study information. The risks related to patient confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_40397] a separate link file for patient study ID and the MRN. The study ID will be used on the questionnaires. Patients' medical data will be reviewed and abstracted by [CONTACT_367198]. All data will be stored on a secure server at NCH. The Patient ID-Participant ID link file will be stored in a separate location on the server from other study data for an additional layer of security and confidentiality. 16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects* There are no known direct physical, psychological or social benefits immediately for the subject, although it is possible that the subject might have fun playing the virtual reality games and he/she might experience improved cognitive rehabilitation with use of the virtual reality tools. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Virtual Reality-based Rehabilitation for Children with Traumatic Brain Injuries 
 Page 15 of 23 HRP-503  v.12.10.18 In general, we anticipate that this study will provide critical data to improve rehabilitation methods available for pediatric TBI patients, and potentially help future patients to further improve TBI rehabilitation. 17.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality 17.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures or power analysis. To examine the research paradigm (Aim 1), we will compute average number of children screened and enrolled per month, proportion of eligible children who enroll, treatment-specific retention rates, proportion of children who adhere to assigned condition, proportion of planned measures that are completed, and average duration of completing each measurement. To examine the feasibility and safety of the VICT program (Aim 2), the total number of AEs/SAEs, mean simulator sickness scores, and mean Borg exertion scores will be computed and compared between the intervention and control group using independent samples t-tests. Additionally, open-end feedback from children, parents, and clinicians on optimizing the VR games and best practices in protocol implementation will be synthesized and submitted to the VR development team for improvement. Finally, to explore the preliminary efficacy of the VICT program (Aim 2), difference scores from baseline to post-intervention and baseline to follow-up of the composite NIH Toolbox score, TBI-QOL, and Conners CPT 3 will be compared between the intervention group and the control group using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for baseline scores. BRIEF2, CBCL-APS, and PedsQL (parent/child) scores at follow-up will be compared between the two groups using ANCOVA controlling for baseline scores. Cohen’s d for core EFs changes will be computed as the preliminary intervention effect size. Finally, dosage effect will be evaluated within regression analyses, with dosage ([ADDRESS_1164958] training for intervention group) as the primary predictor and post-intervention NIH Toolbox scores as the outcome variable. 17.2 Describe the steps that will be taken to secure the data (e.g., training, authorization of access, password protection, encryption, physical controls, certificates of confidentiality, and separation of identifiers and data) during storage, use, and transmission. All data will be independently entered into a computerized database by [CONTACT_838641]. All data files will be maintained in the central electronic database system, REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), which is securely stored at the Research Institute at NCH. Each participant will be assigned a unique Study ID number. The master file that links the participants’ names to their Study IDs will be maintained only in a password 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Virtual Reality-based Rehabilitation for Children with Traumatic Brain Injuries

The data to be collected include: Age, gender, race, injury severity scores, including Glasgow Coma Scale score and Rancho Scale level, gaming performance in the virtual program, and standard neuropsychological testing results. Demographic and medical variables listed above will be collected via patients' medical records. We will also include the amount of time spent in each rehab therapy using the Rehabilitation Provision of Services flow sheet in EPIC. Performance in games will be automatically recorded by [CONTACT_838643]. Cognitive variables will be collected via standard neuropsychological tests. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet will be created for use by [CONTACT_838644], and also of patients who meet exclusion criteria and are not recruited. The spreadsheet will include the following variables: MRN, patient name, gender, age, guardian name(s), telephone number(s), email address(es), recruited (Y/N), study ID number, study group (Intervention or Control), dates of VR therapy, times of VR therapy, and reason for exclusion (for patients that are not recruited). The rationale behind the eligibility spreadsheet is to track how many pediatric TBI patients are treated, and of those, how many are willing to participate in our study.

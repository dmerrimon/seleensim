2.0 PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
Title of Clinical Study: A Phase IV, Multi -Center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-
Controlled, Parallel -Design Study to Determine the Safety and 
Efficacy of VI -0521 in Obese Adolescents  
Sponsor:  VIVUS, Inc. (VIVUS)  
Phase of Development:  4 
Indication:  Weight management  in obese adolescents  
Study Rationale:  Obesity remains a major problem in pediatrics. National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data indicate that 18.5% of children and adolescents age 2 to 19 years and 20.6% of adolescents age 12 to 19 years met the definition of obesity in 2015-2016. Obesity in childhood or adolescence increases the risk of adult obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
VI-0521 (marketed as Qsymia
® in the [LOCATION_002]), a fixed 
dose combination of immediate- release (IR) phentermine 
(PHEN) and extended- release (ER) topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (TPM), was 
approved in July [ADDRESS_339280] to a reduced-
calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in overweight and obese adults. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_277894] 
2 years, typi[INVESTIGATOR_277895] 1–3 mg/kg/day and titrating as needed to 5 –9 mg/kg/day. Adequate and well-
controlled studies of phentermine have not been conducted in children. 
Based on a previously completed PK study of obese adoles cents 
(study OB-402), PK parameters in obese adolescent  subjects 
were consistent with those observed in previous Phase 1 to 3 studies conducted in adult obese subjects. 
This study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of 
VI-0521, accompanied by a lifestyle modification program, in 
obese adolescents.  
Study Design:  In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -design study, approximately 200 subjects 
will be enrolled at approximately 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002].  
Subjects will  be randomly assigned in a 1:1:2 ratio to placebo, 
N=50; mid-dose (PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg), N= 50; or top -
dose (PHEN/TPM 15 mg/92 mg ), N=100 of VI -0521, to be 
taken orally once daily in the morning. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (12-14 vs 15-16 years old) and gender. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, followed by a 56- week treatment period.  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Subjects will be instructed to follow a mild hypocaloric diet 
modification program representing a 500- calorie/day d eficit and 
to implement a family -based lifestyle modification program  for 
adolescents, as tolerated, throughout the study period. The 
lifestyle program will include physical activity, behavior change, and family support. The same lifestyle modification pro gram, 
specific to this population, will be implemented across all sites. Study drug doses will be titrated according to the following schema.

the study will be encouraged to remain on study (off study drug) 
for continued follow-up by [CONTACT_277919] -related procedures performed,  and to return at the 
56-week time point for measurements and evaluations. For those who choose to completely withdraw from the study at any point, the end of study (Week 56) procedures should be completed. 
Study Objectives:  The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
VI-0521 (PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg and PHEN/TPM 
15 mg/92 mg doses) for the treatment of obe sity in adolescents. 
The secondary objective is to characterize changes in obesity -
related risk factors.  
Duration of Treatment: The treatment period will be 56 weeks.

Study drug will be packaged into 2 types of kits; titration kits 
(blister cards) for use during the first [ADDRESS_339285] 4 weeks following up- titration for subjects randomized to 
the top-dose (W eeks 13-16), and treatment kits (bottles), for use 
once subjects have been titrated to their assigned dosage.  
Regimen/Administration: Each capsule of study drug will be taken orally in the morning, with or without food, and with water.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:  The primary endpoint is the mean percent change in BMI from baseline to end of study (Week 56) 
Second Efficacy Endpoints:  The secondary endpoints are: 
• Percent of subjects achieving a reduction ≥ 5%, ≥  10% 
and ≥ 15% of baseline BMI at Week 56; 
• Change from baseline in waist circumference at Week 56; 
• Change from baseline in fasting insulin and Whole Body 
Insulin Sensitivity Index (Matsuda) at Week 56; 
• Change from baseline in triglycerides and HDL- C at 
Week 56; 
• Change from baseline in blood pressure at Week 56. 
Exploratory Endpoints: Additional exploratory analyses will be conducted to evaluate 
effects of treatment on IWQOL -Kids questionnaire scores, 
changes in various glycemic and lipid markers, and change in BMI Z-score. 
Safety Evaluations and Oversight:  Safety monitoring and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_277920]/serious adverse events, physical exams, vitals, 
cognitive function tests using the CANTAB, responses to PHQ -
9, C-SSRS, bone age (X -ray of the hand and wrist), DXA in a 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
subset (approximately 25 subjects each on the placebo and mid-
dose, and 50 subjects on the top-dose), and periodic monitoring 
of laboratory test results . 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to evaluate accumulating trial data on a periodic basis and to assess the ongoing safety of the study.  
Statistical Methods : Analysis Populations: 
Randomized: This population will be comprised of all subjects 
who were initially randomized.  This population will be used for 
summaries of subject disposition and baseline subject 
characteristics.  
Intent-to-treat (ITT)/Safety: This population will be comprised 
of all subjects who were initially randomized and received at 
least one dose of study drug. This will be the primary population for all summar ies of subject disposition and baseline 
characteristics, efficacy analyses, and safety analyses for purposes of regulatory submissions. 
Comparisons in the primary endpoint of change from the 
baseline BMI between treatment  groups will be assessed using a 
mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) with 
factors of treatment, visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], baseline BMI value, age stratification, and gender stratification. Appropriate contrast will be applied for treatment comparisons at Week 56. The [ADDRESS_339286] are 1) top -dose vs. 
placebo; 2) mid-dose vs. placebo; and 3) top-dose vs. mid-dose. 
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to examine the impact of missing data on the robustness of statistic al conclusions.  
In previous studies  in adults, PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/[ADDRESS_339287] size, with enrollment of 200 subjects ( 100 randomized to the top-dose , 50 
randomized to the mid -dose, and 50 randomized to the placebo), 
the present study will have greater than 90 % power to detect a 
significant difference in BMI reduction between the top-dose 
and the placebo, and approximately 80% power to detect a significant difference between the mid-dose group and the 
placebo. The above power calculation assumes very conservative differences between the active doses and placebo and a worst 
case 30% dropout rate.

4.0 BACKGROUND  
Obesity remains a major problem in pediatrics. National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES ) data indicate that 18.5% of children and adolescents age 2 to 19 years and 
20.6% of adolescents age [ADDRESS_339290] (orlistat) to treat adolescent obesity. Additional pharmacotherapy options are needed in order to address pediatric obesity. 
VI-0521 (marketed as Qsymia
® in the [LOCATION_002]), a fixed dose combination of immediate-
release (IR) p hentermine (PHEN) and extended- release (ER) topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (TPM), was approved in 
July 2012 by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) as an adjunct to a reduced- calorie diet 
and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in overweight and obese adults. 
Mean weight loss of > 10% was achieved after one year of treatment in obese adults randomized to top-dose (PHEN/TPM 15  mg/92 mg) and > 8% in those randomized to mid- dose (PHEN/TPM 
7.5 mg/46 mg) of VI-0521. Weight loss was sustained over two years. In addition to weight loss, 
VI-0521 also resulted in significant reductions in blood pressure, improved glycemic parameters, 
increased HDL -C, and reduced triglycerides.
5 The doses employed in this combination represent 
a fraction of those commonly prescribed as single agents for other indications. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_277894] 2 years, typi[INVESTIGATOR_277899] 1–3 mg/kg/day and titrating as needed to 5–9 mg/kg/day.[ADDRESS_339291] not been conducted in children. The top-dose of VI -
0521 contains roughly ½ of the maximum phentermine dose currently approved for use in adults. 
The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of topi[INVESTIGATOR_277900]-[ADDRESS_339292] been fully investigated in the adult population. The major route of elimination of phentermine and its metabolites is through the urine. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_214398] (approximately 70% of an administered dose). Previous population PK analyses demonstrated that creatinine clearance and body weight were the most important components 
describing the PK of phentermine and topi[INVESTIGATOR_277901]-0521, that the PK parameters of phentermine and topi[INVESTIGATOR_277902], and that no relationship was observed between PK parameters and age, gender, or body mass inde x (BMI) for either drug.  
By [CONTACT_277921], their kidneys are fully developed and there is little variation in kidney function compared to adults. 
Based on the PK study of obese adolescents (s tudy OB-402), plasma concentrations in obese 
adolescents were consistent with those observed in previous Phase 1 to 3 studies conducted in 
adult obese subjects.  
For phentermine , geometric means of individual posterior Bayes PK parameters (apparent 
clearance [ CL/F] and apparent volume of distribution [ Vc/F]) in obese adolescent subjects were 
within 10% of those previously assessed in obese adult subjects enrolled in Phase 2 and Phase 3 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
studies, and arithmetic means of area under the curve ( AUC) and C max in obese adolescent 
subjects were within 10% of arithmetic means previously obtained based on rich concentration-
time profiles of phentermine under steady- state in obese adults. Medians of T max in adolescent 
subjects were within 11% of medians of T max observed  in obese adults.  
For topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] , geometric means of individual posterior Bayes CL/F were within 30% of those 
previously assessed in obese adult subjects enrolled in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, with higher CL/F values in the adolescent population. Geometr ic means of posterior Bayes Vc/F of TPM in 
obese adults and obese adolescents were similar. The higher CL/F values in adolescents are consistent with lower serum creatinine values in this population, but did not result in marked differences in exposure, as arithmetic means of AUC and C
max of topi[INVESTIGATOR_277903] 12% of 
arithmetic means previously obtained based on rich concentration- time profiles of topi[INVESTIGATOR_277904]- state in obese adults. Medians of T max in adolescent subjects were within 2% of 
medians of T max observed in obese adults. 
This study is being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of VI -0521, accompanied by a 
lifestyle modificatio n program, in obese adolescents. 
5.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VI-0521 for the treatment of 
obesity in adolescents. The secondary objective is to characterize changes in obesity -related risk 
factors. 
6.0 STUDY DESIGN  
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel-design study, 
approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Subjects will  be randomly assigned in a 1:1:2 ratio to placebo, N= 50 ; mid-dose (PHEN/TPM 
7.5 mg/46 mg), N= 50; or top -dose (PHEN/TPM 15  mg/92 mg), N =100, of VI -0521, to be taken 
orally once daily in the morning. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (12-14 vs 15-16 years old) and gender. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, followed by a 56-week treatment period. 
Subjects will be instructed to follow a mild hypocaloric diet modification program representing a 
500-calorie/day deficit and to implement a  family-based lifestyle modification program  for 
adolescents, as tolerated, throughout the study period. The lifestyle program will include physical activity, behavior change, and family support. The same lifestyle modification program, specific to this po pulation, will be implemented across all sites. Study drug will be titrated as 
described in Section 8.4.1. 
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the assigned dos e may be treated at a reduced dose level or 
may take a drug holiday as defined in Section 8.4.4. In addition, for growth monitoring, investigators will monitor rates of weigh t loss in treated subjects. For subjects with baseline BMI 
95-98
th percentile, reduce study drug dosage when BMI is < 85th percentile or when weight loss 
exceeds an average of 2 lbs (0.9 kg) per week. For subjects with baseline BMI ≥ 99th percentile, 
reduce study drug when weight loss exceeds an average of 2 lbs (0.9 kg)/week. 
All subjects will return at approximately 4 -week intervals for study assessments.  All female 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
subjects will undergo a pregnancy test at each visit.  Subjects who discontinue study drug during 
the study will be encouraged to remain on study (off study drug) for continued follow-up by 
[CONTACT_277919]-related procedures performed, and to return at the 56-week time p oint for measurements and evaluations. For those who choose to completely 
withdraw from the study at any point, the end of study (Week 56) procedures should be 
completed.

6.3 Exploratory Endpoints: 
Additional exploratory analyses will be conducted to evaluate effects of treatment on Impact of 
Weight on Quality of Life- Kids (IWQOL-Kids) questionnaire scores, changes in various 
glycemic and lipid markers, and change in BMI Z- score. 
6.4 Safety Endpoints  
Safety will be assessed by  [INVESTIGATOR_42600] a dverse events  (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs); vital 
signs, laboratory parameters (screening, periodically during the study and end of study); electrocard iograms; physical examinations ; cognitive  function tests using the Cambridge 
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB) . All subjects will be screened for the 
presence and severity of depression using the PHQ -9: Modified for Teens ( Appendix 4
) and for 
suicidal/ideation using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS) (Appendix 5: 
Sample Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ) and follow up assessments will be done at each 
visit after treatment has been initiated. Bone age (X-ray of the hand and wrist) will be evaluated 
at baseline and end of study or early termination. Effect on bone mineral density and bone mineral content , as evaluated by [CONTACT_11342] -energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (D XA) will b e performed 
at baseline, end of study or early termination, at selected sites.

7.[ADDRESS_339299] Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to withdraw from the clinical trial or discontinue treatment at any time for any reason. 
The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue this trial at any time (see Section  13.0 on clinical 
trial discontinuation criteria).  
Subject participation in this clinical trial may be discontinued for any of the following reasons: 
• Occurrence of any medical condition or circumst ance that exposes the subject to 
substantial risk and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to the requirements of the protocol; 
• Any serious adverse event (SAE), clinically significant adverse event (AE), severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illne ss, or other medical condition that indicates to 
the Investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the subject;  
• Subject's (or a parent’s or legal guardian ’s) decision to withdraw; 
• Requires other medical treatment that is excluded  by [CONTACT_760] ( see Section 8.5); 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
• Subject failure to comply with protocol requirements or study related procedures; or  
• Termination of the clinical trial by [CONTACT_456], FDA, or other regulatory authorities. 
Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
Subjects discontinued from treatment should be encouraged to remain in the trial off- treatment 
and to continue study visits at the scheduled intervals.  Subjects who withdraw completely from 
the trial at any point should complete the end of study (Visit 16, Week 56) procedures. The date 
of last dose should be recorded. Every effort should be made to document subject outcome. For subjects who elect to withd raw 
from the trial without continuing study visits, the investigator should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the 
subject return for a final visit (Section 9.1.4) and follow -up with the subject regarding any 
unresolved adverse events.  
At about the 56-week time point, withdrawn subjects who have not continued stu dy visits should 
be asked to return to the site to obtain weight and height measurements at a minimum and, if 
possible, all the other tests and procedures ( except physical examination and ECG)  required for 
end of study visit. 
If a subject withdraws from the trial and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations will be performed and no additional data will be collected. 
The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of 
consent. 
8.0 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
8.1 Study Treatment  
Eligible subjects will receive 56 weeks of treatment with either VI-0521, or matching placebo for 
daily use. 
8.2 Allocation to Treatment 
Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the performance of any study- related 
procedures. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:2 ratio to placebo, mid-dose 
(PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg) or top-dose (PHEN/TPM 15 mg/92 mg) of VI -0521. Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_25890] (12-14 vs 15-16 years old) , and will be implemented using an 
Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS). The sponsor, the subjects, and the study site will be 
blinded as to subject randomization. 
When a subje ct qualifies for randomization, site personnel will log into the IWRS to obtain a 
specific titration blister card  or bottle number to dispense to the study subject. The subject will 
return the study drug at every clinic visit for drug accountability  and will be dispensed with a 
new blister card/bottle for the next treatment period.  
8.[ADDRESS_339300] not be unblinded during the study unless it is considered absolutely necessary 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
by [CONTACT_277923]. Under 
such conditions, i nvestigators will  first contact [CONTACT_277924] a 
subject and if unblinding is deemed medically necessary the identity of the study treatment may 
be obtained via the IWRS . Any subject whose treatment assignment has been unblinded must be 
withdrawn from the study. 
Investigators are also  required to ensure that any potential SAEs are reported according to the 
requirements outlined in Section 11.1.5 and provide a written report to VIVUS or designee 
within 7 days to document the reason for unblinding. 
8.4 Drug Supply  
Clinical supplies will be manufactured for VIVUS by  [CONTACT_277925] (cGMP) . All clinical supplies will be 
labeled with information required by [CONTACT_2091]. 
8.4.1 Formulation and Packaging  
Sufficient quantities of VI-0521, phentermine and topi[INVESTIGATOR_277907] a designee at the study site. All clinical 
supplies will be labeled with information required by [CONTACT_277926]/or international regulations. Study drug will be packaged into 2 types of kits; titration kits (blister cards) for use during the first 4 weeks of study treatment and the titration period during study Weeks 13 -16, and treatment 
kits (bottles), for use once subjects have been titrated to their assigned dose . 
Each titration kit contains [ADDRESS_339301] will be labeled with the week number (1 through 4) and will contain capsul es with the dose specified for that

8.4.[ADDRESS_339303] be taken in a 
specific order (i.e. Week 1 before Week 2, and Week 3 before Week 4). 
When dispensing study drug bottles , investigators should ensure that subjects understand that 
each bottle contains a 4-week supply of study drug, and that the capsules must be taken for the treatment period that the bottle is dispensed for. Instruction should also be provided that each bottle contains extra capsules that should only be taken should the next study visit be scheduled beyond [ADDRESS_339304] subjects to return  all 
study drug (blister card and the bottle, even if empty) to the site at each study visit. 
8.4.4 Dose Reduction and/or Interruption During Trial Participation 
Dose reduction is an option for subjects who experience adverse events that are sufficiently 
severe to cause the subject to consider discontinuation or to cause the investigator concern about 
the subject’s ability to continue in the study. 
It should be recognized that caloric restriction resulting in rapid weight loss (independent of any 
specific drug mechanisms) carries the potential to negatively affect growth. Due to the potent ial 
of the study drug to cause significant weight loss which may affect growth in adolescents, investigators should actively monitor the subject’s rate of weight loss and growth (using height and weight), and implement a down-titration of study drug should rates of weight loss in a given subject exceed rates that are deemed safe. For subjects with baseline BMI 95 -98
th percentile, 
reduce study drug dosage when BMI is < 85th percentile or when weight loss exceeds an average 
of 2 lbs (0.9 kg) per week. For subjects with baseline BMI ≥ 99th percentile, reduce study drug 
when weight loss exceeds an average of 2 lbs (0.9  kg)/week. 
Dose reduction is implemented through the IWRS, and will be done without breaking the blind. Subjects assigned to the mid-dose may be reduced down to the low-dose and those assigned to the top-dose may be reduced down to the mid-dose, and if necessary, the low-dose in a blinded manner. Dose reduction is not an option for subjects who experience intolerable adverse events related to study medication during the first week of titration (W eek 1) during the initial 
randomization; these subjects will be withdrawn from treatment.  
When dose reduction is not appropriate or when dose interruption may be required due to events unrelated to study trea tment, subjects may temporarily discontinue from treatment (up to 7 days) 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
on one or more occasions. Dose interruptions longer than [ADDRESS_339305] is dosed with study medication should be recorded on the case 
report form (CRF).  
If the subject remains in the trial off -treatment, all study procedures should be continued for the 
duration of subject participation and they should be encouraged to return at the 56- week time point for measurements and evaluations. For those who choose to completely withdraw from the study at any point, the end of study (Week 56) procedures should be completed. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_339306] compliance with study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_277928]. Subjects whose actual capsule consumption differs from their expected capsule consumption by [CONTACT_726] 20% should be queried by [CONTACT_277929], and site personnel should plan any corrective action as necessary. Subjects who remain noncompliant with study drug dosing despi[INVESTIGATOR_277908]. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_339307] be stored in its packaging at controlled room temperature , 15 to 
25°C (59 to 77°F) with excursion to 30°C (86°F) , in a dry, secure area.  Access to drug storage 
areas should be limited to the investigator and designated staff involved with the study. All used and unused drug must be maintained at the study site and made available for audits by [CONTACT_277930].  
It should be noted that phentermine, one component of the VI -[ADDRESS_339308] maintain records documenting the amount, condition, and date of delivery 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
of all study drug received from the sponsor. In addition, all drug dispensed to study subjects 
during the course of the study must be recorded on the appropriate accountability forms. Subjects must be instructed to return all empty containers and all unused medication in its original packaging, and sites must make an accounting of drug use by [CONTACT_6992]. No study drug, used or unused, may be discarded. All used and unused drug must be returned to the sponsor or designated representative upon completion of the study. 
8.[ADDRESS_339309] be discontinue d from the  study: 
• Anticonvulsants used for treatment of seizure disorder, including barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], GABA analogues, hydantoins, phenyltriazines, succinimides, and other agents (valproic acid and its derivatives, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_277897], zonisamide, and felbamate);  
• Tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, lithium, levodopa, and dopamine receptor agonists; 
• Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; 
• Insulin, sulfonylureas ( SFUs), GLP-1 agonists, SGLT -1 inhibitors , and SGLT-2 
inhibitors; 
• Chronic systemic steroids (i.e. glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids) other than oral contraceptives;  
• Treatment for hyperactivity disorder; or  
• OTC, prescription medications, herbal agents and dietary supplements used with the intention to lose body weight. 
8.5.2 Other Restricted Medications  
Subjects using hormone replacement therapy (estrogen, thyroid, or other) or allowed antidepressants must be on doses that have been stable for at least [ADDRESS_339310] 1 month prior to screening, and the frequency of use does not exceed twice a week.  
Subjects m ay not initiate any other organized weight loss program during their participation in 
this study. 
8.5.3 Documentation of Concomitant Medication Use  
All concomitant medications, including OTC products and nutritional/herbal supplements, must be listed on the appropriate CRF at study entry. Any changes in concomitant medication use during the course of the study must also be noted on the appropriate CRF. 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
8.[ADDRESS_339311] be discontinued from the trial.  Subjects whose blood glucose cannot be 
adequately controlled with the concomitant treatments allowed in this trial should be maintained in the study but discontinued from treatment, and referred back to their primary healthcare provider for more intensive treatment (see Section 7.3). 
During treatment, subjects whose fasting blood glucose is less than 72 mg/dL on [ADDRESS_339312] their antidiabetic therapy reevaluated.  
8.7 Treatment of Elevated Blood Pressure 
For subjects whose blood pressure requires management, antihypertensive therapy should be 
initiated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). If these medications are already present, calcium channel blockers,  beta-blockers, or 
thiazide diuretics may be added. 
Subjects whose blood pressure exceeds 140/[ADDRESS_339313] 
undergone dose increases or the addition of antihypertensive medications over each of 3 visits, should be discontinued from study drug and referred back to their primary healthcare provider for more intensive management. Subjects may continue attending study visits off study drug, and if blood pressure control is re-established without requiring excluded medications, subjects may be restarted on study drug. 
Subjects whose blood pressure drops below 110/[ADDRESS_339314] their antihypertensive medications reevaluated.  
8.8 Treatment of Hypothyroidism  
Individuals who experience rapid weight loss sometimes develop signs and/or symptoms of hypothyroidism with or without elevation of TSH. Subjects who develop symptoms of hypothyroidism need not be discontinued from study drug. These subjects should be assessed clinically and with appropriate laboratory testing (TSH, free T3, free T4).  Subjects found to be 
hypothyroid may be considered for thyroid replacement therapy, as appropriate.

9.[ADDRESS_339316] will begin when written informed consent is provided and will continue until Week 56 or early termination is completed.  Sites should link the scheduling of 
visits to the baseline/randomization visit (Visit 2, Day 0). Visit windows are provided to allow 
subject and site scheduling convenience. However, every effort should be made to ensure that visits occur within these windows so that the overall treatment duration  is 56 weeks for subjects 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
who complete all visits.  In certain instances, adverse event information may be required for 
events occurring after the study period (Section 11.3). 
10.[ADDRESS_339317] weights should be obtained, whenever possible, under the same conditions (no shoes, clothing of similar weight) that were employed at the first (Screening) weigh-in. Subjects should be encouraged to complete their weigh -in visits in the morning.

Ensure that the subject is relaxed. Ensure that the tape is snug but does not indent or compress 
the skin, and make the measurement (in centimeters) at the end of a normal expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
10.3 Height and BMI  
Height measurements (cm) and BMI will be determined by [CONTACT_277934]  (see BMI Chart 
in Appendix 2 ). Height measurements should be made using a calibrated stadiometer without 
shoes, socks, or hats. At each study visit, [ADDRESS_339319] daily, if used, following the equipment’s 
manufacturer instructions and/or site SOP . 
If a subject does not meet the BMI criterion for inclusion into the study ( see CDC Clinical 
Growth Chart8 in Appendix 3 ), no further screening procedures should be undertaken. 
10.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], temperature) will be assessed at each study visit.  Subjects should be seated comfortably for at 
least 10 minutes prior to assessing vital signs.  Heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_277909] (heartbeats or breaths) for a period of 30 seconds and multiplying these values by 2 to obtain the rates per minute. A calibrated cuff should be employed for blood pressure measurements. Site staff should ensure at the Screening visit that the cuff size used is appropriate for the patient’s arm circumference.  Overweight and obese 
subjects often require a larger cuff than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_277910]. The same cuff should be used for the same subject across multiple visits when blood pressure is performed. T he same person should perform all assessments for a given subject.

Puberty maturation will be assessed using the Tanner Staging (also known as the Sexual Maturity Rating (SMR), a gender specific [ADDRESS_339321]. 
10.6 Electrocardiograms  
Twelve-lead ECG studies will be performed at baseline, and end of study or early termination 
visits. ECGs will be evaluated for clinically significant abnormalities th at would prevent entry 
into the study, and for arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, or other clinically relevant changes between randomization and each of the subsequent evaluations. Parameters including heart rate, R-R, P-R, QT intervals, and QRS duration will be recorded.  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
10.[ADDRESS_339322] 
X-ray data will be standardized as described in a separate document. X -rays will be read at a 
central facility and the reader will be blinded. 
10.8 DXA (Sub Study)  
A bone health sub-study will be conducted at selected sites in approximately 100 subjects (25 each on placebo and mid-dose, and 50 on top-dose) to assess the effect of Qsymia 
administration on bone health using Dual X -ray Absorptiometry (DXA). DXA scans of the 
posterior- anterior (PA) spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (lumbar), and total body less head (TBLH) will be performed at 
baseline and at the end of study or e arly termination. Equipment and procedures used to obtain 
DXA data will be standardized as described in a separate document. Sites involved in DXA measurement will be trained on these procedures prior to performing scans on study subjects. Scans will be read at a central facility and the reader will be blinded.  
The following enrollment criteria will apply:  
1) Both male and female will be eligible to participate;  
2) Subjects with a history of any non- traumatic fracture will not be eligible;  
3) Subjects with juvenile osteoporosis at baseline will not be eligible; and  
4) Subjects must meet manufacturer equipment specifications with regard to height and weight limitations.

The OGTT will use a 75  g oral glucose load; blood samples will be obtained at baseline and at 
[ADDRESS_339325] glucose load for evaluation of both glucose and insulin levels. 
10.11 CANTAB (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) 
Cognitive function will be assessed using selected tests from the CANTAB including paired 
associates learning, pattern recognition memory, and spatial span. The C ANTAB will be 
assessed at screening  (familiarization session only), baseline, Week 16 (Visit 6), and end of 
study or early termination . 
10.[ADDRESS_339326] of Weight on Quality of Life- Kids (IWQOL -Kids) questionnaire ( Appendix 6 ) is a 
27-item, self-administered instrument that will be completed at baseline, and end of study or 
early termination . 
The IWQOL -Kids is validated for use in adolescents aged [ADDRESS_339327] of excess weight on quality of life domains including physical 
mobility and comfort  (Physical Comfort), how an individual feels about themselves and their 
body (Body E steem), how an individual is treated in their social environment (Social L ife), and 
the individual’s perception of what family members may think and feel about them (Family 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Relations).[ADDRESS_339328]’s answers to this questionnaire reflect their perceptions and attitudes at the time the questionnaire is completed, and that missing answers cannot be queried at a later date.  It is critical, therefore, that site personnel review questionnaires 
for completeness at the time they are initially filled out, and that any missing answers are completed before the subject leaves the office.  
10.13 PHQ-9: Modified for Teens 
The Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ -9: Modified for Teens ) (Appendix 4 ) is 
a 9-item, self-administered instrument for the asse ssment of depression in adolescents.  
Because this instrument is intended to be completed directly by [CONTACT_4866], it is important that site personnel remain neutral and do not influence subject answers on this questionnaire in any way. Should subjects ask questions to site personnel regarding the meaning of specific items, site personnel should not interpret items for subjects, rather, they should repeat items back to subjects as they are worded on the instrument. Because this questionnaire assesses the subject’s level of depression over a specific time frame (the past 2 weeks), answers not completed by [CONTACT_277935] a given visit cannot be queried or filled in at a later date. Site personnel, therefore, must carefully review questionnaires for completeness before subjects leave the clinic, and assure that questionnaires are properly completed.  
The PHQ-9 questionnaire is being used to screen for and to assess the severity of any depression 
in study subjects. This questionnaire will be completed at every visit . Answers to the 
questionnaire may reveal evidence of significant depression, including the possibility of suicidal thoughts or plans. It is the responsibility of the investigator to evaluate subjects’ responses to these questionnaires carefully, and to perform any additional evaluation and management that is indicated, including referral to a mental health professional if necessary. The evaluation by [CONTACT_277936]-[ADDRESS_339329] presenting with a PHQ -9 score of 15 or 
more should be treated and may require referral to a qualified mental health care professional.  
10.14 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale is an 11- item clinician -administered assessment of 
both suicidal behavior (6 items) and suicidal ideation (5 items).10 Each of the items comprising 
this scale corresponds to a specific level, or severity of ideation or behavior, and is answered on a yes/no basis. This assessment will be administered to all subjects at screening in order to confirm the absence of suicidal behavior or ideation with at least some intent to act on it, and to document the pre-study status of all subjects included in the treatment program. Subsequently, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
C-SSRS evaluations may be done at the investigator’s discretions to evaluate and aid in 
diagnosis of reported or suspected events of suicidality. All C- SSRS assessments must be 
administered by a trained staff member. If any test reveals suicidal behavior or ideation with some intent to act on it, then test results must be confirmed by a physician investigator prior to discharging the subject from the study visit (s ee Appendix 5
). 
11.[ADDRESS_339330] also assess whether adverse events meet the criteria for classification as serious adverse events requiring immediate notification to VIVUS  or its designated 
representative.  
11.1.1 Severity Assessment  
Investigators will assess the severity of all adverse events using the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of each adverse event.  For 
purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
• MILD: Does not interfere with the subject’s usual function; 
• MODERATE:  Interferes to some extent with the subject’s usual function;  or 
• SEVERE:  Interferes significantly with the subject’s usual function.  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe event 
is not necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes 
significantly with subject’s daily function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for SAEs listed in Section 11.1.5. 
11.1.2 Causality Assessment  
Investigators are required to provide an assessment of causality for all adverse events (serious and non-serious) observed during this study. This assessment  will provide a determination of 
whether, in the investigator’s judgment, there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event. For this assessment, investigators must categorize the causality as either “related” or “not related” . For an adverse 
event to be considered “related” to the study treatment, there should be evidence that the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of study treatment, or that the 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
event follows a known response pattern to the drug . Causality would be further confirmed by 
[CONTACT_277937][INVESTIGATOR_277912]. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_339331] finding should be reported as an adverse event are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms;  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; or 
• Test result is considered by [CONTACT_277938] a clinically significant 
finding. 
11.1.4 Mood or Depression Related Events 
All subjects will be screened for the presence and severity of depression at screening using a 
validated survey instrument (PHQ -9) designed for assessment of depression in a primary care 
setting. The PHQ -9 is a self -administered, nine-item depression module based directly on the 
diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in DSM-V- TR. This questionnaire may be used 
at the investigator’s discretion at other times during the study to aid in diagnosis and evaluation 
of reported or suspected events of depression. 
Suicidality will also be assessed at each study visit using the C -SSRS (see Appendix 5 ). The C-
SSRS may also be used at the investigator’s discretion at unscheduled visits  during the study to 
aid in evaluation and diagnosis of reported or suspected events of suicidality. Should this 
additional assessment indicate the presence any suicidal behavior, or suicidal ideation with any intent to act on it, study treatment will be stopped, and the investigator must provide appropriate referral to a mental health professional for additional assessment and management.  Any such 
event must be reported to the Medical Monitor and to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_339332] diagnostic 
criteria and terminology. 
11.1.5 Serious Adverse Events or Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions  
As defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 312.32), an adverse event or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening adverse event (Note: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject in immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse 
event or suspected adverse event that, had it occurred in more severe form, might have 
caused death.  The determination of whether an adverse event is life -threatening can be 
based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_109873] .); 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; or  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
If either the sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be 
considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_102673]. 
11.1.6 Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277913]. Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility meets these criteria.  
Outpatient ambulatory surgical procedures (same-day surgeries) and routine emergency room treatment do not qualify as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Additionally, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149327] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_277914]. Examples include, but are not limited 
to any of the following: 
• Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the development 
of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the pre-existing condition (e.g., for work up of persistent pre- treatment abnormality);  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical examination);  
• Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (e.g., for 
elective cosmetic surgery); or  
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event. Fo r example, an 
acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the adverse event. 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
11.[ADDRESS_339333] no n-leading question, 
such as “Have you experienced anything new or different since your previous study visit?” 
Certain adverse events require prompt and specific action by [CONTACT_277939]. 
11.[ADDRESS_339334] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information.  
This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previ ously reported 
SAE. 
In the event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 1 business day after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.  
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to VIVUS  or 
designee in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_277940]-up 
information in an expedited fashion. This information may be more detailed than that captured on the adverse event CRF . In general, this will include a description of the SAE in sufficient 
detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications and illnesses, must  be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of 
available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to VIVUS  or its designee. 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
11.4.[ADDRESS_339335] immediately discontinue study treatment and report the pregnancy to VIVUS or designee within 1 business day of learning of the pregnancy. 
The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination 
(i.e., elective pregnancy termination) and then notify VIVUS or designee of the outcome. The investigator will provide this information as a follow -up to the initial pregnancy report.  
For reported pregnancies that result in a live birth, the status of the newborn should be assessed at the time of birth. The status of an aborted fetus sh ould be assessed by [CONTACT_4692], 
unless pre-abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly. 
If pregnancy outcomes meet the criteria for classification as SAEs (i.e.,  stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. 
Similarly, any pregnancy outcomes that are considered to be adverse events should be reported as such on the appropriate CRF. However, pregnancy in itself need not be reported as an adverse event if th ere is no associated adverse outcome.  
For reporting purposes, ectopic pregnancies should be reported as SAEs, but because the fetus is not potentially viable, they need not be reported as a pregnancy. 
12.0 STATISTICAL PLAN 
12.1 Statistical Analysis  
Detailed methodol ogy for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this clinical 
trial will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoints definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. Additional statistical analyses other than those described in this section may be performed if deemed appropriate and included in the plan. The SAP will be finalized and s igned prior to the finalization of the 
database. 
12.2 Sample Size Determination  
In previous studies in adults, VI -0521 mid-dose ( PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg) resulted in a 
placebo-subtracted BMI reduction of 2.[ADDRESS_339336] errors below what was observed before. If we enroll 200 subjects (50 placebo, 50 mid-dose, and 100 top -dose), we will have at least 90% power to detect a statistically 
significant difference between  the top-dose ( PHEN/TPM 15  mg/92 mg) and the placebo because 
we could assume that the top-dose will have a highe r effect size than the mid-dose. This 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
calculation assumes that there will be an approximately 30% dropout rate. This sample size will 
also provide approximately 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference between the mid-dose and placebo. 
12.3 Analysis Populations 
Three different analysis populations will be used for analysis of data from this study, as described below: 
• Randomized: This population will be comprised of all subjects who were initially randomized. This population will be used for summaries of subject disposition and baseline subject characteristics.  
• Intent-to-treat (ITT)/Safety: This population will be comprised of all subjects who were 
initially randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. This will be the primary 
population for all summaries of subject disposition and baseline characteristics, efficacy analyses, and safety analyses for purposes of regulatory submissions.  
• Modified Intent- to Treat (m -ITT): This population will be comprised of all randomized 
study subjects who receive study treatment and return for at least one post-randomization assessment of height and weight. This population will be used for the analysis of all efficacy variables for all other purposes, including but not limited to publications, presentations, and robustness of sensitivity of analyses.  
12.4 Subgroups  
BMI change will be tabulated by [CONTACT_65634]. Additionally, further exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints may include evaluation by [CONTACT_277941]/or other subgroups dee med medically and/or scientifically important.  
12.5 Statistical Methods  
12.5.1 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is the mean % change in BMI from baseline to end of study 
(Week 56). 
Comparisons in the primary endpoint of change from the baseline BMI between treatment 
groups be assessed for the ITT population using a mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) with factors of treatment, visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], baseline BMI value, age stratification, and gender stratification.  Appropriate contrast will be applied for treatment 
comparisons at Week 56. The pairwise comparisons of interest are top -dose vs. placebo, and 
mid-dose vs. placebo, and top-dose vs. mid-dose. The primary null hypothesis will be that there 
is no treatment difference between any VI -[ADDRESS_339337] will be used for the comparisons at Week 56. The family- wise type 1 error for the comparisons will be c ontrolled by 
[CONTACT_3493]’s protected least significant difference ( LSD) method at the 0.05 significance level:  
placebo, mid-dose, and top-dose will be first compared for overall difference in the percent 
change from baseline in BMI.  Once the overall difference is significant at the 0.05 significance 
level, the above 3 pairwise comparisons will be conducted using Fisher’s LSD method at the 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
0.[ADDRESS_339338] sensitivity analysis is using a multiple imputation method based on the monotonic missing pattern under the assumption of missing at random (MAR). The intermittent missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) procedure. 
The second sensitivity analysis is also using multiple imputation, however, under the assumption 
of missing not at random (MNAR) to explore the validity of MAR using pattern-mixture model: 
1) For subjects who discontinue study participation prior to Week [ADDRESS_339339] the primary endpoint measurement in the follow up visit using a regression method. The intermittent missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation MCMC pro cedure. an ANCOVA 
model using a similar mixed procedure (without the repeated measures) as the primary 
analysis will be applied to these multiple-imputed % change in BMI at Week [ADDRESS_339340] ratification factors. 
The results of ANCOVA analysis on the multiple imputed datasets will be combined and summarized.  
2) Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_208412]: Subjects from the treatment arm who drop out the study will have their unobserved efficacy data imputed by [CONTACT_277942] (MAR) with the resulting imputed values further worsened by [CONTACT_277943] δ. Subjects who drop out the study from the control arm will be assumed to exhibit the same evolution of the disease as the completers in control arms and their values will be imputed by [CONTACT_277944] (MAR) above without the addition of δ. Sensitivity analysis may be performed for a range of δ to find a “tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]” value of δ at which study conclusions start to change. When δ=0 the missing data are assumed to be MAR. When δ > 0, the missing data are assumed to be MNAR. 
The third sensitivity analysis is the last observation carried forward (LOCF). For those subjects who discontinue study participation prior to Week 56, the last observed weight and height will be 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
used to derive the change in BMI . 
Similar analyses will be performed for the primary endpoint for the m -ITT population. 
12.5.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints  
If both the mid- and top-doses are shown to be statistically significantly better than placebo for 
the primary endpoint using the Fisher’s LSD procedure, then the secondary endpoints will be 
tested in a stepwise way to preserve the familywise type 1 errors.  Details of the stepwise testing 
procedure for secondary efficacy endpoints will be described in a prospective SAP. 
Percent of subjects achieving a reduction ≥ 5% from baseline in BMI at Week [ADDRESS_339341] and baseline BMI value as a covariate at the 0.05 significance level . The adjusted odds 
ratios between the top-dose and placebo and between the mid -dose and placebo will be 
calculated together with their 95% confidence intervals.  The p-values for the comparisons will 
also be generated.  
The percent of subjects achieving a r eduction ≥ 10% and ≥ 15% from baseline in BMI at 
Week 56 will be analyzed similarly.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints that are continuous variables will be analyzed by a similar MMRM model as for the primary endpoint where the baseline BMI value will be replaced by [CONTACT_277945] a covariate. 
The above analyses will be conducted for both the ITT and m -ITT populations. 
12.6 Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be done for the ITT population. Safety data will be summarized for all 
treatment groups. 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_277946] (each study visit); laboratory 
parameters (screening, periodically during the study and end of study); electrocardiograms; 
physical examinations (screening, end of study); PHQ-9: Modified for Teens (see Appendix 4 ), 
C-SSRS, and vital signs , at each study visit ). Descriptive statistics will be generated for the 
questionnaire data.  
12.6.[ADDRESS_339342] X- ray will be evaluated.  Differences 
between treatment groups will be evaluated using methods similar to those used to evaluate other continuous variables.  
12.6.3 Analysis of DXA  
In the subset of subjects treated at sites where DXA scans are being done, mean changes from 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
baseline to Week 56 in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC)- Z scores 
will be evaluated.  The mean change in BMD and BMC will be summarized descriptively as a 
continuous variable . 
12.6.[ADDRESS_339343] of multiplicative factors for each laboratory 
parameter will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  The frequency and percentage of 
subjects with laboratory results above or below the normal range and threshold limits at each scheduled assessment or any time during the treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
12.6.6 Vital Signs and Other Safety Evaluations  
Mean blood pressures , heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , rate and temperature, obtained at each visit, will be 
summarized and plotted by [CONTACT_1570]. Medications, other than study medication, taken during the study will be considered as concomitant medications. They will be summarized by [CONTACT_277947], using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.  
12.7 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned. 
12.8 Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) with multidisciplinary representation will be established to evaluate accumulating trial data on a periodic basis and to assess the ongoing safety of the study for the subjects enrolled and to be enrolled. As a result, following each data review, the DMC will make a recommendation to the sponsor regarding continuation, revision, 
or termination of the study. Details related to DMC responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in the DMC charte r, which will be finalized by [CONTACT_277948].

Data generated by [CONTACT_277949], by [CONTACT_277950] a designate acting on behalf of the sponsor, by [CONTACT_277951], and by [CONTACT_277952].  At a subject’s request, medical information may be given to their 
personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for their welfare. 
Subject medical information obtained during the course of this study is confidential and 
disclosure to third parties other than those noted above is prohibited.

that the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP ) are being follo wed. The monitors may 
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow VIVUS monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory 
authorities direct access to source documents to perfo rm this verification.  
The study site and study-related documents may be subject to review by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, and/or to 
quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_277953], and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_277954].  
It is important that the investigator (s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
16.[ADDRESS_339347] /Independent Ethics Committee  
Regulations require that an IRB/IEC oversee all investigational drug clinical trials . This board or 
committee, the makeup of which must conform to local and regional regulations, will approve all aspects of the trial, including the protocol, advertising and written informed consent form (ICF) 
to be used prior to initiation of the trial. It is the responsibility of the investigator to have 
prospective approval of the clinical trial protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the investigator f ile. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
approvals should be forwarded to VIVUS  or its designee. 
Amendments to the protocol must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_277955]/IEC prior 
to implementation. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to 
IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immed iate hazards to 
the subjects.  In that event, the investigator  must notify the IRB/IEC and VIVUS  in writing within 
5 working days after the implementation. 
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_1683] /IEC advised of the progress of the study and 
of any changes made to the protocol as deemed appropriate. 
16.[ADDRESS_339348] of the Clinical Trial 
The clinical trial will be performed in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmoniz ation Good Clinical Practice (ICH  GCP) guidelines, and applicable local regulatory 
requirements and laws.  
16.[ADDRESS_339349] Information and Consent /Assent 
The informed consent form and any changes to the informed consent form during the course of 
the trial must be agreed to by [CONTACT_277955]/IEC and must be in compli ance with ICH 
GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. 
The investigator or designee(s)  must ensure that each clinical study subject is fully informed 
about the nature and objectives of the clinical trial and possible risks associated wit h 
participation.  The investigator or designee(s) will obtain written informed consent from each 
subject before any trial- specific activity is performed.  The informed consent form used in this 
clinical trial, and any changes made during the course of the trial , must be prospectively 
approved by [CONTACT_28150]/IEC and VIVUS  before use.  The original signed copy of the informed 
consent form must be maintained by [CONTACT_277956] a 
representative of VIVUS , their representatives, auditors, the IRB/IEC and/or regulatory agencies.  
A copy of the signed informed consent form will be given to the subject. 
Parental consent and/or subject assent will be obtained according to IRB/IEC guidelines.  
17.[ADDRESS_339350] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
17.1 Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
As used in this proto col, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an 
electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this clinical trial. A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property of VIVUS and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of VIVUS or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from VIVUS.  
It is the investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all CRFs. 
CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_198429]. These signatures serve to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true. At all times, the investigator 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory 
data entered on the CRFs.  Subject source documents are the physician's subject records 
maintained at the study site. In most cases, the source documents will be the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the 
physician's chart.  In cases where the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54602]'s chart, 
the information collected on the CRFs must match those charts.  
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, VIVUS and the 
investigator must prospectively document which items will be recorded in the source documents and for which items the CRF will stand as the source document. A CRF is requi red and should 
be completed for each randomized subject. The completed original CRFs are the sole property of VIVUS and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of VIVUS or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from VIVUS. 
17.[ADDRESS_339351] Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or VIVUS , the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. 
The records should be retained by [CONTACT_95348], local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer. 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, VIVUS  should 
be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such 
as another investigator, another institution, or to VIVUS. The investigator must obtain VIVUS ’ 
written permission from VIVUS before disposing of any records prior to completion of the 
required/st ipulated retention period. 
18.0 PUBLICATION PLAN 
Publication of study results is addressed  in the Clinical Trial Agreement  with each site.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  Lifetime 
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. 
Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If 
there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If 
person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered 
an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so 
no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they  thought that what they did could be 
lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life? 
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself  
(like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious 
Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self -
injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609]. Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this 
becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward 
self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they 
pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is 
grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet 
started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  Since Last Visit  
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. 
Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If 
there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual 
suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or 
harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an 
accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they  thought that 
what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life? 
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to 
relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious 
Behavior without suicidal intent)

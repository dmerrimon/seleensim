 Consent  Date of Issue 6/5/2018  Alzheimer’s Prevention Through Exercise (APEx)  ClinicalTrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
CONSENT FORM Alzheimer’s Prevention through Exercise (the APEx study) Funded by: [CONTACT_56758] (NIH) and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals  Why am I being invited to take part in a research study? You are being asked to join a research study examining the role of aerobic exercise in brain health, metabolism and aging. You are being asked to take part in this study because you have enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Center (ADC) Registry, where a Florbetapir PET Scan was performed and showed amyloid deposits in your brain. This study involves a one year exercise program.  No medication or treatment will be administered. This research study will take place at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC).  What should I know about a research study? You do not have to participate in this research study, and you may change your mind at any time. Participating in research is different from getting standard medical care. The main purpose of research is to create new knowledge for the benefit of future patients and society in general. Research studies may or may not benefit the people who participate.    This consent form explains what you have to do if you are in the study. It also describes the possible risks and benefits.  Please read the form carefully and ask as many questions as you need to, before deciding about this research.    You can ask questions now or anytime during the study. The researchers will tell you if they receive any new information that might cause you to change your mind about participating.  You may be asked to sign a new consent form if this occurs.  If you have participated in studies with the ADC previously, we may use information from those studies to determine your eligibility for this study. When appropriate, we may also use data previously collected by [CONTACT_56759].  Furthermore, data collected by [CONTACT_56760].  Why is this research being done? Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder which causes memory and thinking problems. In most people with symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, a protein called amyloid beta collects and forms deposits in the brain. The precise role of these deposits in causing Alzheimer’s disease continues to be debated but many scientists believe that over time amyloid deposits may cause the death of nerve cells that result in memory and thinking problems.  The brain deposits of amyloid appear to occur years, perhaps decades, prior to the first symptoms of memory loss become apparent.  Studies are ongoing to define more precisely what it means to have amyloid in the brain but early evidence suggests having amyloid in the brain may increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_6237]’s disease.  On the other hand, it is clear that many individuals with amyloid in the brain never develop memory and thinking problems and other factors such as your genes and lifestyle influence whether you develop the disease.   By [CONTACT_56761], researchers hope to learn about the possible benefits of exercise in controlling or reducing the amount of amyloid present in the brain, reducing changes in 
Page [ADDRESS_61969]? We expect that you will be in this research study for about 13 months.  How many people will be studied? About 100 people will be in the study.  What will I be asked to do? If you are found to be eligible and decide to participate, your participation will involve clinical evaluations to assess your memory and thinking skills, quality of life, laboratory blood testing, MRI and PET scans of the brain, and physical fitness testing. These evaluations may take up to [ADDRESS_61970] 90 days. After you successfully complete these evaluations, you will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to either an aerobic exercise intervention group or a control group. You will have a 70% chance of being placed in the Aerobic Exercise Group and a 30% chance of being placed in the Control Group.  If you are assigned to the exercise group, you will be provided a membership to the local YMCA or another exercise facility that has been approved by [CONTACT_56762].  You will exercise at your exercise facility 3-[ADDRESS_61971] and procedure listed above:  Medical History and Current Medications: You will be asked about your medical history, such as surgeries, medical illnesses or reactions, or medications and supplements you are taking. Every time you are contact[CONTACT_56763].    Cognitive and Health Assessments: These tests will take approximately [ADDRESS_61972]: This will take about 20 minutes to complete. Approximately 4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn from a vein in your arm for routine laboratory tests. You will be asked to not eat or drink, except water for 8 hours before coming to the clinic for these tests.   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain: The entire MRI will last about [ADDRESS_61973] up to 2 hours.  During this procedure, you will be asked to lie still in a magnetic resonance imaging machine (MRI) while a pi[INVESTIGATOR_56749]. A special ring will be placed around your head to provide better images and your head and shoulders will be placed in a tunnel. The researchers will make you as comfortable as possible with padding and 

Page 4 of 12  blankets. As the MRI examination is performed, you will hear loud knocking noises coming from the MRI scanner and you may feel warm. This is all normal for an MRI examination. You will be provided ear protection including earplugs and/or earmuffs.  After pi[INVESTIGATOR_56750], you may be asked to perform tasks while an MRI scan is performed. The tasks are simple and require watching or responding to images you see on a screen in front of you.   Physical Function and Fitness Level Assessments: These following 3 assessments will be completed in one visit, which will take approximately 2 hours to complete  • Physical Function Tests: You will have several standardized tests to measure your ability to perform physical activities such as rising from a chair, walking, lifting a book, measuring your hand grip strength and climbing up and down stairs. You will be asked questions about your independence in performing activities of daily living such as dressing, washing, feeding and questions about your physical activities.   • Aerobic Fitness Level Assessment: You will also be asked to walk on a treadmill to assess your body’s response to exercise. This is similar to a stress test, except you will breathe through a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. The mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_56751] a tube to a computer to measure the air you breathe in and out. Your heart rhythm will be monitored by [CONTACT_56764].  Your blood pressure will be assessed every [ADDRESS_61974] if you do not meet the minimum criteria.  • Body Composition Assessment: Your body composition will be assessed using a DEXA scan.  This scan will determine your current levels of body fat, lean tissue and bone density. You will be asked to lie very still during the scan.  PET Scan: The entire procedure will take approximately 1 ½ to 2 hours to complete. A PET scan is an imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image or pi[INVESTIGATOR_56752]. You had a PET scan as part of the screening for this study. If your PET scan occurred more than 90 days prior to deciding to participate in this study, we will ask you to complete another one as part of your baseline evaluations. During this scan your vitals will be monitored. You will be asked to sit or lie down while a small catheter (plastic tubing with a needle on the end) is inserted into a vein in your arm. Florbetapir, a dye that will attach to amyloid in the brain, will be injected through this catheter.   About 50 minutes after the Florbetapir injection, you will be placed comfortably in the PET scanner. You will stay in the PET scanner for about 20 minutes while pi[INVESTIGATOR_56753]. During this time you will be asked to hold your head as still as possible.    
Page 5 of 12  Phone Checks: Periodically, you will be asked in person or by [CONTACT_56765], injuries or medication changes.  You will receive calls from the study staff at week approximately 6, 12, 18, 32, 39, and 46 weeks during your participation in the study. We will also ask you about how well you are keepi[INVESTIGATOR_56754]: exercise or control.  Exercise Group Assignment  Upon successful completion of baseline evaluations, you will be randomly assigned  (like a flip of a coin) to either an aerobic exercise group or a control group. You will have a 70% chance of being placed in the Aerobic Exercise Group and a 30% chance of being placed in the Control Group.  Control Group: If you are assigned to the control group you will be provided educational materials on exercise and healthy lifestyle, but you will not be provided support or guidance with an exercise program.    Exercise Program: If you are assigned to the exercise group you will be asked to exercise 3-5 days per week for 52 weeks at a facility approved by [CONTACT_6268].  You will receive a membership and be supervised by a certified personal trainer.  Prior to starting your program, you will be asked to attend an orientation session at your facility which will be conducted by [CONTACT_56766]. You will be required to follow the study’s exercise program and not do other types of exercise while you are in the study.  Exercise will consist of walking on a treadmill or using other aerobic exercise equipment. During week [ADDRESS_61975] 6 weeks of the program. During weeks 7 – 52, you will only be required to have direct supervision by [CONTACT_56767], as long as you are tolerating the program without difficulty, and there are no safety concerns. You will make appointments for the supervised sessions directly with the personal trainer assigned to you.    You will have your own exercise log or chart that will stay at your approved exercise facility. You will record your exercise in the log. Your trainer will assist you with this task until you can do it on your own.   In the event that you will not be able to exercise at your facility due to travel plans, family obligations, etc, you will need to continue your exercise regimen on your own. We will 
Page [ADDRESS_61976] being in this study could be bad for me? You may experience one or more of the following risks by [CONTACT_55825]. In addition, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this study.  Cognitive and Quality of Life Assessment Risks:  There is a risk of feeling uncomfortable or embarrassed by [CONTACT_56768]. If you feel uncomfortable you may skip a question or stop participating all together.  Fasting Laboratory Blood Test Risks:  The risks of drawing blood from a vein may include discomfort, bruising, swelling of the vein, soreness, pain, and, rarely, infection, fainting or bleeding. This will be minimized by [CONTACT_56769].  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Risks:  MRI scanning is not generally associated with any health risks.  However the MRI uses a magnet to create an image and we are using a closed MRI unit. If you have metal or any foreign object in your body, the MRI magnet may cause it to displace, which can cause bodily injury. To minimize this risk, you will be prescreened by [CONTACT_56770]. This is further minimized by [CONTACT_56771].  You may find the narrow space in the closed MRI frightening or uncomfortable, especially if you have known anxiety or claustrophobia (fear of tight spaces).  To help lessen this, the MRI unit has a mirror so that you can see outside of the scanner.  Also, the MRI unit

Physical Function, Fitness Level Assessment and Exercise Program Risks: Exercise testing is commonly performed on individuals with heart disease and these studies can be used to provide an estimate of the test’s risk in healthy older adults. The risk of exercise testing in healthy older adults appears to be low. If you have a recent history (in the past two years) of heart disease (for example, heart attack, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure) you may be excluded from the study. The fitness level assessment is intended to evaluate your maximal exercise ability, so you will be asked to exercise to the point of fatigue. You may experience shortness of breath, dizziness, muscle fatigue, sweating, fatigue, muscle soreness, injury to tendons, ligaments, joints, bone or muscle during the testing. You may experience muscle soreness for up to [ADDRESS_61978] include unpredictable changes in blood pressure or heart rhythm, heart attack and death. To minimize potential risks during the exercise assessment, the researchers and a clinician will review your medical history and a resting electrocardiograph (ECG).  If you experience heart rhythm or ECG changes during exercise testing, we may ask you to be evaluated by a cardiologist to obtain clearance for exercise.  The adhesive patches on your chest, arms, and legs used for ECG monitoring may cause redness, rash, itching, or blisters.  If you have had a stress test in the past, we will ask you to sign a medical release of information form so that we can obtain those records, for our review, prior to testing. If you experience chest discomfort, dizziness or any other problems, the test will be discontinued immediately.   Body Composition (DEXA) Assessment Risks: You will be exposed to a low level of radiation during the DEXA scan. This radiation exposure is not needed for your medical care. You are exposed to background radiation every day from the sun and the earth. The amount of radiation you receive during a DEXA scan is less than the amount you receive in 2 months from  the earth and sun. The risk from this radiation exposure is very low. The DEXA scan machine uses a laser to align to your body. Although the laser is not normally hazardous to eyesight, you will be asked to close your eyes. 
Page 8 of 12   PET/CT Scan: You will be exposed to radiation from a PET/CT scan. This radiation exposure is not needed for your medical care. The amount of radiation you receive during the PET/CT scan is about the same amount that you receive in about 5-[ADDRESS_61979] common side effects seen with the use of Florbetapir are headache, injection site reactions, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, back pain, anxiety/claustrophobia, insomnia, hypertension, and neck pain.   Possibility of Unknown Risks There may be other side effects or risks that are not yet known.     NEW INFORMATION You will be told about anything new that might change your decision to be in this study. You may be asked to sign a new consent form if this occurs.

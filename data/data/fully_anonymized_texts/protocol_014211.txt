The Indego exoskeleton was approved for use by [CONTACT_839877] [ADDRESS_1167288] 
injury  (SCI)  at levels T4 and below for rehabilitation  use, and for T7 and below for personal use in the home and 
community. Shepherd Center was  instrumental in leading the multi -site clinical trials that led to the Indego FDA 
approval for persons with SCI . 
 
Shepherd Center , in collaboration with Vanderbilt Univer sity and Parker Hannifin Corporation , has also led the 
clinical research efforts for use of Indego for persons with hemiparesis resulting from cerebrovascular accident 
(CVA)  since 2012.

STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 
Primary Objective :  
 
• To demonstrate  that the Indego® device is  safe to use as a gait training intervention for persons with 
hemiplegia due to CVA.  
 
Results of this multi -site study to include 40 subjects will be submitted to the FDA as part of a 510K Parker 
Hannifin submission to seek FDA approval for Indego use with persons following stroke.  
 
 
Hypothesis:  
 
• Indego  can be safely used  as a gait training intervention for persons with hemiplegia due to CVA for 
persons with mild, moderate or severe stroke.  
• Indego can be safely used as a gait training intervention for persons with hemiplegia due to CVA for 
persons with acute (less than 2months), sub - acute (2 -6 months) and chronic (greater than 6 months) 
onset.  
• Following six Indego sessions, persons with hemiplegia due to CVA may show improvements in mobility 
when compa ring pre- training measurements to post -training measurements .

Forty s ubjects in tot al will be enrolled across nine clinical sites: Shepherd Center  (GA) , Cedar Sinai Medical 
Center (CA), Rusk Rehabilitation (NY), Sheltering Arms (VA), St Charles Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (NY) , Craig Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (CO), 
Kessler Foundation (NJ), Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, IL)  and TIRR Memorial 
Hermann (TX). Subjects will be seen three times per week for two weeks.  
 
Up to five subjects are expect ed to be enrolled at Shepherd Center.  
 
 Session Content  Session Duration  
Session [ADDRESS_1167290] be made to 
reschedule within the same week. The maximum amount of time the protocol may be interrupted or extended (due 
to illness, weather, other) is two weeks. The number of study visits remains the same . 
 
Shepherd C enter will be provided wi th an Indego® kit  for the duration of the trial. This kit will include small 
(short), medium and large (tall) hardware components, all necessary padding options , and 2 hand held IPod touch 
operator controllers. Parker wil l provide “on call” engineering support.   
 
Enrollment for PHIND_CVA01 will be on a rol ling basi s so that each site  can enroll any number of subjects until 
the total subject numb er across sites reaches forty . Should a subject not complete all study session s, an additional 
subject will be added to replace the person who did not complete the study. Data for persons who did not 
complete all sessions for the study will be analyzed separately.  
 
Subjects may be enrolled from inpatient, day program, outpatient, p ost rehabilitation programs , or from  home.  
Researchers will not attempt to have an equal representation among “programs” of when the subject was enrolled . 
However, the sponsor will attempt to have a mix of acute, sub acute and chronic conditions .  
 
In add ition, enrol lment will be monitored based on severity of motor involvement using the Fugl -Meyer Motor 
Assessment (FMA) .  The maximum FMA score is 100 (Upper Extremity maximum score = 66 and Lower 
Extremity maximum score =34). The FMA will be scored by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_839870].  
 
• Mild = FMA Total Motor Score greater than 79  
• Moderate = FMA Total Motor Score 56 -79 
• Severe = FMA Total Motor Score 36 -55 
• *Very Severe = FMA Total Motor Score 0 -35. 
(Duncan, Goldstein, Horner, Landsman, Samsa and Matchar 1994)  
 
*Sponsor does not anticipate enrolling persons in the Very Severe FMA Category ; subjects must be able to 
walk 14 meters or 46 feet with the assistance of one to two persons  to qualify for study participation .

RATIONALE  
The following is paraphras ed from S.A. Murray’s dissertation “Development and assessment of a control 
approach for a lower -limb exoskeleton for use in gait rehabilitation post stroke.” Vanderbilt University, 2016 :1 
 
CVA is one of the leading causes of chronic disability in the United Stated .  There are an estimated 6.6 million 
people having survived a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and an estimated 610,[ADDRESS_1167296] -incident CVAs 
occurring each year  in the [LOCATION_002] [1]. Restoration of gait functionality is often  a high priority during  
rehabilitation in patients with lower -limb hemiparesis [2, 3] .  This has thereby  [CONTACT_839882] -assisted gait -training devices in recent years.  
  
While  results vary i n the highly -heterogeneous population of stroke patients, a recent meta -analysis found that  
electromechanically -assisted rehabilitation devices may improve the likelihood that a patient will recover the 
ability to walk  independently [4]. Many control appro aches have been proposed and described for the control of 
these robotic  devices [5 -15]. These control strategies can be roughly categorized as either a “trajectory -based 
controlled ” or “non-trajectory -based  controlled”  type. Trajectory -based controllers  dictate the spatiotemporal 
nature of joint movement ; non-trajectory based controllers do not. Examples of the latter include force tunnels 
around the desired trajectory [8, 12, 14], teach -and-replay impedance based control strategies to generate subject -
specific trajectories [16], and model -based strategies to target specific portions of the gait cycle [9, 17].   
 
The following is paraphrased from S.A. Murray et. al 201 9, currently in preparation for publication1 
 
A trajectory control approach can offer fu nctional advantages relative to a non -trajectory control approach, such 
as the ability to consistently reproduce healthy gait kinematics, provide full movement assistance, and provide

 Confidential   Page 8 of 11 early therapy to subjects who may otherwise be non -ambulatory.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] t hese potential advantages, researchers 
hypothesize that  a trajectory -based control approach  may allow patients to assume a passive  role within the 
device, since the device is,  in essence , provid ing full coordination and effort associated with movement.  It is 
well-known that increased patient  participation  results in improved outcomes [18, 19], and therefore recovery is 
more likely if the machine promotes active rather than passive patient participa tion.  
 
Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_839873] a trajecto ry-based controller, researchers  hypothesize that a non -trajectory -based 
control approach would place increased responsibility for coordination and movement on the patient, and would 
therefore require greater engagement, and thus presumably result in improved functional outcomes.   
 
Use o f Indego for the  proposed  study is a non -trajectory based contro ller approach. Use of the Indego controller 
for persons with stroke has been safely utilized in the following studies, previously approved  by [CONTACT_839883]:  
 
• Projec t #510:  i -Step Long -Leg Orthosis  (3 subjects with CVA enrolled . Study  has been closed ) 
• Project #660:  Engineering Assessment of the Indego® Software Controllers – Parker #ENG1  (8 subjects 
with CVA currently enrolled . Study remains active ) 
 
In previous Shepherd RRC approved studies , gait parameters were controlled and  manipulated by [CONTACT_839884] a  tethered cord from the Indego device to a laptop computer. For the  proposed study, 
the gait parameters will be manipulated by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_839874].  
 
To date there have been no serious adverse events of falls using the Indego with persons with. No sites  other than 
Shepherd Center  have completed research  using the Therapy Mode controller that was designed for persons with 
stroke and other neurological disorders.  
 
The proposed study will allow a greater number of subjects and participating sites to evaluate the safety of the 
Therapy Mode  Indego  controller  and assist in data collection for potential approval through the Parker 510 K 
submission by [CONTACT_839885] a gait training tool for persons with hemiplegia due to stroke.

Ipod touch controller:  
1. Joint Neutrals , 
2. Gravity Compensation  
3. Stance Support  
4. Swing Support  
5. Feedback .  
 
Each of these 5 main categories  is adjustable for the right and /or left sides of the body.  
  
                                                 
 
Joint Neutrals : Pressing the “Reset Neutrals” buttons will cause Indego to capture the current position of each 
joint and treat this stored angle as the joint’s neutral position (i.e. Indego will treat the  stored position as though it 
were zero degrees of flexion or extension at each joint). This permits Indego to automatically calibrate itself to 
adjust for slight misalignment between the user and the Indego, or to adjust for users who walk with joint angles 
that differ from the  anticipated.  
 
Gravity Compensation:  Reduc es the weight of the user’s leg (i.e. making the user’s limb seem lighter during 
gait). The percentage of the user’s limb weight to be accounted for may be varied independently for each leg by 
[CONTACT_839886]. The amount of compensation is 
represented on a scale of 0 to 100 percent in 10 percent increments. Changing the support level adjusts the support 
for both upper - and lower leg compensation.  
 
Stance Support:  Stabilizes the stance limb by [CONTACT_839887].

 Confidential   Page 10 of 11 Swing Support:  Provide s an additional push at the hip or knee joints when gravity compensation is insufficient to 
achieve the desired joint excursion during swing. Flexion assistance becomes active as soon as the Indego detects 
that the user is attempting to take a step, and rem ains active until either the duration of the flexion assistance 
passes, or the user begins to extend the knee. Extension assistance is provided once the knee begins to extend, and 
lasts until the knee achieves adequate extension or until heel strike is det ected.  
 
Feedback:  Provide s audio feedback in order to signal to the user and clinician that the user achieved a desired 
step length. When heel strike is detected, Indego calculates the length of the step. If the step met or exceeded the 
goal step length th e iPod will produce an audible chime.  
 
The Indego  Dashboard  provide s objective information during and following each therapy session , 
including : the current state, the number of steps taken, total session time, walking time, battery level, power 
limiting level, stride length, step symmetry, and gait speed during a session.

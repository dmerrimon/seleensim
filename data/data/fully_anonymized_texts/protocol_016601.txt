CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 88 Correlative/Exploratory:  
• Correlative markers include baseline and on -treatment serum levels of 
chemokines, cytokines, antibodies to tumor antigens, and other immune 
mediators (e.g. sIL2R  and CTACK for PTCL; CD30 , IL-31 and IL -32 for 
CTCL) as deemed relevant by [CONTACT_456].  
Study  Design 
and Procedure  This is a multi -center, open label, non -randomized, two -part Phase I/II study of 
Tenalisib  in combination with Romidepsin  in adult p atients with 
relapsed/ refractory TCL . The first part is a n open label, 3+3 design, Phase I dose 
escala tion for MTD  determination. The second part is a Phase II, dose expansion 
to delineate the safety and anti -tumor activity of the combination at the 
MTD/optimal dose.  
 
In dose escalation, a minimum of 2 and maximum 1 8 patients will be enrolled in 
three dose levels unless additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ 
optimal dose. In dose expansion, up to 24 TCL patients will be enrolled (Group 
1 = 12 PTCL patients and Group 2  = 12 CTCL patients).  
 
The study will end when all ongoing subjects have reach ed their third tumor 
assessment on Cycle 8/Day 1 (C8D1) or have discontinued from the study for 
any reason, whichever is earlier. At the end of the study, all ongoing patients 
with no evident disease progression will be given the opportunity to enroll in a n 
open -label compassionate use study protocol and will be followed up.  
 
PHASE I (DOSE ESCALATION):  
Sequential dose escalation will begin with Cohort 1. A minimum of three patients 
will be enrolled at each dose level. Dose levels will be increased in successive 
increments according to the dose escalation cohorts mentioned in the table below . 
Escalation to the next cohort will occur if no patient w ithin a three -patient cohort 
or one in six patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). De -escalation 
to different lower doses in case DLT criteria is met, will be done as per the 
discretion of Safety Review Committee (SRC). The highest doses of th e 
combination (Tenalisib at 800 mg BID plus Romidepsin IV 14 mg/m2) will be 
considered as optimal in case there is no DLT  at this dose level.  
Dose escalation scheme:  
Cohort  N Tenalisib1 Romidepsin2 
Cohort 1  3-6 Tab. 400 mg PO twice a day  IV 12 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Cohort 2  3-6 Tab. 600 mg PO twice a day  IV 12 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Cohort 3  3-6 Tab. 800 mg PO twice a day  IV 14 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Note: Alternate dose levels/dosing schedules may be considered by [CONTACT_799242].  
1In case the dose (e.g. 8 00 mg BID ) is leading to DLT of the combination , the dose of 
Tenalisib will be reduced to lower do se (e.g. 6 00 mg BID ) and will be evaluated for 
safety in a separate cohort .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 88 2In case the dose (e.g. 14 mg/m2) is leading to DLT of the combination, the dose of 
Romidepsin will be reduced to lower dose (e.g.12 mg/m2) and if required further to 10 
mg/m2 and will be evaluated for safety in a separate cohort.  
 
DLT assessment: The data of at least 3 patients will be required for DLT 
assessment. DLT assessment period will be 28-days  (inclusive) (will begin on 
C1D1 and end on C2D1) , unless extend ed by [CONTACT_7195]. In the first 
cycle, p atients must have been treated with at least [ADDRESS_1102352] dose  escalation at the 
discretion of investigator  after discussion with medical monitor .

Estimated 
Study 
Participation  Dose Escalation :  Approximately 10 months for accrual and follow up  
Dose Expansion :  Approximately 18 month s for accrual plus patient follow up.  
Assessment of 
Response   Initial disease assessment will be performed at screening.  The r esponse  to 
treatment will be done at C3D1 (± 7 days), C5D1 (± 7 days), C8D1 (± 7 days) 
and/ or at the EOT and or as clinically indicated (if clinical progression is 
suspected or for confirmation of complete response/disease progression). The 
following assessment s will be done.  
 
PTCL :  
The re sponse assessment will be done using CT scan as per the Lugano 
classification. PET -CT will be preferred for FDG -avid lymphomas. PET -CT will 
be performed at C3D1 (± 7 days) and to confirm the CR. Bone marrow biopsy 
will be performed to confirm complete resp onse.  
 
CTCL:  
Response assessment in CTCL will be done as per the modified  Severity 
Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) .  Additionally, CT scan will be done in 
the CTCL  patients with lymph node and visceral involvement. CTCL patients 
with subcutaneous lesions which cannot be measured by [CONTACT_799246] -CT avid lesions. Bone marrow biopsy will be 
performed in patients with B 2 blood involvement. In these patients, Sezary cell

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 88 Tenalisib  tablets will be self -administered orally twice daily one hour before a 
major meal (e.g. breakfast and dinner). Patients should not consume food duri ng 
this one -hour period. On the day of  Romidepsin therapy , the morning dose of 
Tenalisib  will be given in clinic one hour prior to Romidepsin infusion . 
 
Romidepsin :  
Romidepsin will be administered intravenously (IV) over a 4 -hour period on 
days 1, 8 and 15 in a 28-day cycle.  
Statistical 
Analysis  
 Part 1:  In Dose Escalation, three patients per cohort are considered appropriate 
for the assessment of overall safety and tolerability and for providing adequate 
confidence for dose escalation. No formal sample size and power analysis is 
done. Accordingly, total 2-18 patients will be enrolled in 3 escalating cohorts 
unless additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ optimal dose.  Optimal 
dose will be determined by [CONTACT_12217].  
Part 2:   Total 24 patients with relapsed/refractory TCL will be enrolled in two 
groups (12 patients in each group).   
 
The SRC may modify the sample  size due to unforeseen clinical situations.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 88 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Tenalisib ( RP6530 ) 
The phosphoinositide -3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes involved in various cellular 
functions, including cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intrace llular 
trafficking and immunity .[1-3] Tenalisib  is a highly specific and orally available dual PI3K 
δ/γ inhibitor with nano -molar inhibitory potency and several fold selectivity over α and β 
PI3K isoforms. The specificity of Tenalisib  towards PI3K δ and γ is evidenced by >1000 
and >[ADDRESS_1102383] both PI3K δ/γ isoforms in enzyme, cell, and blood -
based assays. Additionally, the compound inhibited antigen -induced superoxide or cytokine 
release from primary human neutrophils or monocytes at nano -molar concentration 
indicating a potential in modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Studies using 
immortalized B and T lymphoma cell lines demonstrated the anti -proliferative effect of 
Tenalisib  coupled with induction of apoptosis and a concomitant inhibition of the 
downstream biomarker, pAKT. Similarly, cytokine induced  pAKT was inhibited in 
malignant primary CTCL cells isolated from patient donors. Tenalisib  induced apoptosis of 
patient derived primary CTCL cells  following 48 hr incubation .  
 
In vivo efficacy of Tenalisib  was confirmed in a subcutaneous mouse MOLT -4 xen ograft 
model representative of human T -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Oral administration of 
50 mg/kg/BID over an 18 -day period resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth .[4] In 
28-days toxicity stud ies in rat  and dog , once daily oral administration of Tenalisib  was well 
tolerated. Target organ effects were observed in thyroid and liver.  The no -observed -adverse -
effect level (NOAEL) was 20  mg/kg/day in rat and 10 mg/kg/day in dog.  
 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed background information on 
Tenalisib .[5] 
 
1.1.2 Summary of Clinical Evaluation  
To date, Tenalisib  has been evaluated in four clinical trials:  
1. A Phase I Dose Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of RP6530, a dual 
PI3K δ/γ inhibitor, in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies 
(European study: Protocol Numbe r RP6530 -1301) Status: Completed   
2. A Phase I/Ib, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of RP6530, a dual 
PI3K δ/γ inhibitor, in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory T -cell Lymphoma (US study: 
Protocol number RP6530 -1401). Status: Recruitmen t completed. Study Ongoing  
3. An open label, randomized, single dose, crossover study to evaluate food effects on 
relative bioavailability of RP6530 administered in fasting and fed conditions in healthy 
volunteers (Food effect study, Protocol no: RP6530 -1501) . Status: Completed  
4. An Open label, Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RP6530, a novel 
PI3K δ/γ dual inhibitor given in combination with an anti -PD-1 therapy, Pembrolizumab 
in adult patients with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgki n’s lymphoma (cHL). Status: 
Ongoing and currently recruiting.  
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                       Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.  
Amendment 1, 30 November 2018  
Original Version : [ADDRESS_1102384] 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 88 • Safety:  
In RP6530 -1401 study, a total of 58 patients were treated at 200 mg BID (n=4), 400 mg BID 
(n=4), 800 mg BID (Fasting) (n=44) and 800 mg BID (Fed) (n=6) in both dose escalation 
and dose expansion cohorts. Tenalisib demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability profile 
up to 800 mg BID (fasting). Tenalisib 800 mg BID (Fasting) was considered as MTD dose 
in patients with T -cell lymphoma. Majority of AEs include transaminitis, skin rash. 
Treatment related Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1102385]/ALT elevation (n=12), rash (n=4), 
hypophosphatemia (n=2), neutropenia (n=1), INR Increase (n=1), sepsis (n=1), pyrexia 
(n=1), diplopia secondary to neuropathy (n=1), drug reaction (n=1), and bacteremia (n=1). 
Treatme nt related SAE reported were pyrexia (n=1), raised INR (n=1), sepsis (n=1), diplopia 
secondary to neuropathy (n=1), drug reaction (n=1) and bacteremia (n=1).  
  
• Pharmacokinetics:  
In RP6530 -1401 study,  at the 200 mg dose, AUC 0-t and C max were 3713.94 h*ng/mL and 
1463.57 ng/mL at C1D1 respectively; corresponding levels at C2D1 were 3985.52 h*ng/mL 
and 1781.24 ng/mL. Similarly, at the 800 mg dose (fed), AUC 0-t and C max were [ZIP_CODE].17 
h*ng/mL and 2988.66 ng/mL at C1D1 respectively; correspond ing levels at C2D1 were 
[ZIP_CODE].21 h*ng/mL and 3234.50 ng/mL. At the 800 mg dose (fasting), AUC 0-t and C max were 
[ZIP_CODE].67 h*ng/mL and 4174.71 ng/mL at C1D1 respectively; corresponding levels at C2D1 
were [ZIP_CODE].24 h*ng/mL and 3395.28 ng/mL.  Based on C max and AUC, dose proportionality 
was observed up to the 800 mg dose. Upon increasing doses, no changes in T max were 
observed and while changes in T 1/2 were observed, steady state PK parameters of Tenalisib 
as determined on C2D1 revealed no accumulation.  
 
• Efficacy:  
In RP6530 -[ADDRESS_1102386] two cycles of Tenalisib showed an ORR of 46% (16/35 patients) out of which 3 (9%) 
were CR and 13 (37%) were PR.   Eleven patients showed stable di sease (31%). Indication 
specific analysis showed an ORR of 47% (7/15, 3 CR, 4 PR) in PTCL and 45% (9/20, 9 PR) 
in CTCL. Effect of RP6530 on associated correlative markers in PTCL (sIL -2R and CD30) 
and CTCL (IL -31, IL -32α, and CTACK) patients that were eith er a CR, PR, or SD on C3D1 
showed decreased plasma concentrations of markers with the reductions being most 
pronounced for CD30 (57%) and IL -31 (33%) in the respective patient populations.[6] 
 
1.2 Romidepsin  
Romidepsin  is a histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor and was approved by [CONTACT_799248] a nd PTCL in [ADDRESS_1102387] one prior systemic therapy. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_799215] 131 
patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL showed an ORR of 26 % (CR rate of 15  %), 
progression free survival (P FS): 4 months and DoR  of 13 months.[7] Similarly, Romidepsin 
was evaluated in 2 multicenter, single -arm clinical studies in patients with CTCL. 
Cumulative, response rate (ORR) in 167 patients was 35 % (CR rate of 6%) and DoR of 13 
months.[ 7]

T-cell lymphomas (TCL) comprise a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies arising 
from mature T -cells. Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL)  constitut e 10–12 % of non -
Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) in Western countries but are relatively common in Eastern 
Asian, cons tituting about 20  % of mature NHL .[8] There is no consensus regarding optimal 
treatment for PTCL, especially in relapsed or refractory cases, which have very poor 
prognosis. High -dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_182481] 
(ASCT) has been accepted as a salvage treatment for eligible patients, although the evidence 
is unclear.[9] Moreover, the overall prognosis remains dismal in patients unsuitable for 
ASCT.   
 
Cutaneous T -cell lymphomas (CTCLs)  represent a group of rare, clinically and 
pathologically heterogeneous diseases. The incidence of CTCL has been increasing and is 
currently 6.[ADDRESS_1102389] incidence rates being reported among 
males and African -Americans. Mycosis  fungoides (MF) is the most common primary CTCL 
variant and is closely related to a rare leukemic variant, Sézary syndrome (SS). Skin-directed 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as psoralen plus ultraviolet A in combination with retinoids or interferon, are 
used in the early  stage disease and generally produce good, long -term responses. Patients 
with advanced -stage disease require a multidisciplinary approach that includes combinations 
of skin -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], biologic -response modifiers and systemic chemotherapeutic 
agent s. Although patients with early stages of disease have an excellent prognosis, ∼25% 
develop progressive disease.[10-12] The prognosis for patients presenting with advanced -stage 
disease is poor.[10, 11, 13, 14] 
 
Over recent years, several single -agent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_799216]/refractory PTCL . Pralatrexate, romidepsin, and belinostat are all approved broadly 
for PTCL with ORR ’s in phase II studies of 29, 25, and 26  %, respectively. Brentuximab 
vedotin is also approved in relapsed ALCL with an ORR of 86  % in a small phase II trial.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_26607], there are hurdles to overcome in managing patients with PTCL as 
respons es with these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_799217] (all approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_799218] <30%). Given the aggressive nature of PTCL, which has a poor prognosis, 
this patient population represents an unmet medical need.  
 
CTCL patients are respo nsive to treatment in the early stages; patients have a long duration 
of survival but are rarely cured of the disease. For refractory early -stage and advanced -stage 
disease (IIB -IV), a multidisciplinary approach is used that include bexarotene, interferon α, 
extracorporeal photopheresis, histone deacetylase inhibitors  (vorinostat and romidepsin) , 
and antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_799219], systemic chemotherapy, and allogeneic 
transp lantation. Though, these agents, alone or in combinations, are associated with high 
response rates, unfortunately response is often of limited duration (frequently measured in 
months) and especially in advanced cases, characterized by [CONTACT_799249],  probably 
due to treatment resistance.  Therefore, the prognosis for patients presenting with advanced -
stage disease generally poor[10, 11, 13, 14]. Hence , novel therapeutic agents, either alone or in 
combination, are  needed  to achieve better disease control in these patients .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 88 1.3.2 Rationale for Combination of Tenalisib  and Romidepsin     
Modification of histones by [CONTACT_799250] a key role in epi[INVESTIGATOR_799220] (HDAC) and 
histone acetyltransferases (HAT). HDAC inhibitors induce cancer cell cycle arrest,  
differentiation and cell death, reduce angiogenesis and modulate immune response.  
 
Recently it is recognized that TCL may be a disease characterized by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_799221] , partly explain ed by [CONTACT_799251] (HDAC) 
inhibitors . Early phase clinical studies have demonstrated that combination therapy with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_799222] T 
cell lymphoma have enhanced clinical benefit for this group of diseases. Therefore, HD AC 
inhibitors have been increasingly used as a platform to which other novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_799223].  
 
Pre-clinical experiments  demonstrated the synergistic anti -tumor  activity achieved by 
[CONTACT_799252]3K  inhibitor with H DAC inhibitor  in B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary 
NHL/ CLL cells. These experiments  indicate d that interference with PI3K signalling 
dramatically increases H DAC inhibitor -mediated apoptosis in malignant haematopoietic  
cells - this might be through either AKT -dependent or AKT -independent mechanisms. 
Moreover, the dramatic increase in HD AC inhibitor -related apoptosis observed in PI3K  
inhibitor -treated cells appears to be related to the disruption of the ERK signalling 
pathway.[15]  
 
Synergistic potential of the combination of Tenalisib and  Romidepsin in attenuating T -cell 
lymphoma cell proliferation was determined using HuT -78, HuT -102, MOLT -4, and Jurkat . 
Cells were incubated with desired concentrations of DMSO (Vehicle), Tenalisib ( RP6530 ), 
or a combination of Tenalisib ( RP6530 ) and Romid epsin for [ADDRESS_1102391] was determined by [CONTACT_799253] >[ADDRESS_1102392] evide nt in the CTCL cell lines, Hut -78 and HuT -102.

In the clinic al setting , individually, both Tenalisib and Romidepsin has show n good response 
rate of > 25 % (ORR) and dura ble response for >4 months in TCL patients in 
relapsed/refractory setting. It is therefore hypothesized that a Tenalisib /Romidepsin 
combination has the potentia l to synergize and improve depth and durability of responses in 
these patients.  
 
1.3.3 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The safety and tolerability of Tenalisib has been established at 800 mg BID in an ongoing 
study in patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma. Given the fact that both 
Romidepsin and Tenalisib have non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_95611], half of the opti mal dose 
of Tenalisib (400 mg BID) and one dose below the approved dose of Romidepsin (12 mg/m2) 
are considered reasonable as starting dose s of the combination  from safety point of view . In 
line with the approved prescribing information, Romidepsin will be  administered at Day 1, 
[ADDRESS_1102394] benefit from t reatment during 
participation, as clinical trials are designed to provide information about the safety and 
effectiveness of an investigational medicine. Additional details regarding specific benefits

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 88 2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objectives  
• To characterize safety, tolerability and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
of Tenalisib in combination with Romidepsin in patients with R/R T-cell lymphoma.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To assess the preliminary anti -tumor activity of various dose levels of Tenalisib  in 
combination with Romidepsin as determined by [CONTACT_799254] R esponse Rate (ORR)  
and Duration of Response (DoR).   
• To characterize the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tenalisib  and Romidepsin when given in 
combination.  
 
2.3 Exploratory Objectives  
• To correlate clinical efficacy with markers that include but are not limited to qu antitative 
and qualitative measurements of malignant cells, cytokines, and chemokines in 
blood/serum.  
 
 
3 TRIAL DESIGN  
3.1 Trial End Points  
3.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
•  Safety:  
Adverse Event (AE), Grade 3/ 4 AEs, Serious and fatal Adverse Event (SAE), graded 
using NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. 
 
3.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
•  Efficacy:  
1. Objective R esponse Rate (ORR) , defined as sum of CR and PR rates, assessed 
according to the Lugano Classificati on for initial evaluation, staging, and response 
assessment of Hodgkin/non -Hodgkin lymphoma  in PTCL patients; and according to the 
modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) in CTCL patients.     
2. Duration of Response (DoR), calculated as time from the initial response to 
documented disease progression.  
 
•  Pharmacokinetics:  
PK Parameters [AUC (0-∞), AUC (0- t), C max, tmax, Kel, and t ½] of Tenalisib and 
Romidepsin.  
 
3.1.3 Correlative/ Exploratory End Points  
Correlative markers include baseline and on -treatment serum levels of chemokines, 
cytokines, antibodies to tumor antigens, and other immune mediators (e.g. sIL2R and 
CTACK for PTCL; CD30, IL -31 and IL -32 for CTCL) as deemed relevant by [CONTACT_456].  
 
3.2 Design of Trial 
This is a multi -center, open label, non -randomized, two -part Phase I/II study of Tenalisib  in 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                       Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 88 combination with Romidepsin in adult patients with relapsed/refractory TCL . The first part 
is an open -label, 3+3 dose es calation, Phase I study for MTD determination. The second part 
is a Phase II, dose expansion to delineate the safety and anti -tumor activity of the 
combination at the MTD/optimal dose.  
 
In dose escalation, a minimum of 2 and maximum 1 8 patients will be enrolled in three dose 
levels unless additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ optimal dose. In dose 
expansion, up to 24 TCL patients will be enrolled (Group 1= 12 PTCL patients  and Group 
2= 12 CTCL patients ).  
 
The study will end  when all ongoing subjects have reached their third tumor assessment on 
Cycle 8/Day 1 (C8D1) or have discontinued from the study for any reason, whichever is 
earlier. At the end of the study, all ongoing patients with no evident disease progression will 
be given the opportunity to enroll in an open -label compassionate use study protocol and 
will be followed up.  
 
3.2.1 Phase I : Dose Escalation  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Escalation Cohorts  
Sequential dose escalation will begin with Cohort 1. A minimum of three patients will be 
enrolled at each dose level. Dose levels will be increased in successive increments according 
to the dose escalation  cohorts mentioned in Table 1 . Escalation to the next cohort will occur 
if no patient within a three -patient coho rt or one in six patients experiences a dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT). De-escalation to different lower doses in case of DLT criteria met will be 
done as per the discretion of the Safety Review Committee (SRC). The highest doses of the 
combination (Tenalisi b at 800 mg BID plus Romidepsin IV 14 mg/m2) will be considered as  
optimal in case there is no DLT at this dose level .

Cohort 3  3-6 Tab. 800 mg PO twice a day  IV 14 mg/m2 on Day 1, 8 and 15  
Note: Alternate dose levels/dosing schedules may be considered by [CONTACT_799255] .  
1In case the dose (e.g. 800 mg BID) is leading to DLT of the combination , the dose of Tenalisib will be 
reduced to lower dose (e.g. 600 mg BID) and will be evaluated for safety in a separate cohort.  
2In case the dose (e.g. 14 mg/m2) is leading to DLT of the combination , the dose of Romidepsin will be reduced 
to lower dose (e. g.12 mg/m2) and if required further to 10 mg/m2 and will be evaluated for safety in a separate 
cohort.  
 
Notes:  
• For dose escalation decision, safety data of the first 28 -days follow up  and PK data of 
C1D1  and C1D 8 is essential.  
• The dose escalation may occur if no patient within a three -patient cohort experiences a 
DLT as defined in Section  7.6 If one of three patients within a 3 -patient cohort experiences

patients within a dose level experiences a DLT, dose escalation will continue. If two or 
more of six pa tients within a dose level experience a DLT, that dose level will be defined 
as exceeding MTD, no further dose escalation will occur. The previous dose level will be 
considered the MTD or de -escalation to lower dose  level will be done as per the discretion  
of the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Once the MTD/optimal dose of the combination 
is established; the same doses will be expanded to further elucidate safety and efficacy. 
Multiple expansion cohorts will be opened at different dose levels, if deemed nece ssary.  
• If two of the first 3 patients in a cohort experience a DLT, that dose level will be defined 
as exceeding MTD, no further dose escalation will occur. The previous dose level will be 
considered the MTD and will be expanded to further elucidate safet y and to evaluate 
efficacy.  
• The actual number of dose cohorts explored will depend upon the MTD and the safety 
profile observed d uring the conduct of the trial.  Intermediate dose levels and dosing 
schedules may be explored if deemed appropriate.  
• An optimal  dose of combination is defined as the threshold dose s of individual drugs  at 
which Tenalisib/Romidepsin  combination shows clinical activ ity/efficac y (shows 
complete response or partial response) in the disease population and is at or below the 
maximum tolerated dose.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intra -subject Dose Escalation  
During dose escalation, individual patients may be considered for treatment at a dose level 
of Tenalisib /Romidepsin  higher than the dose to which they are initially assigned at 
investigator’s discret ion after discussion with Medical Monitor.  For a patient to be treated at 
a higher dose level of Tenalisib /Romidepsin , the patient must not have experienced a DLT 
at the assigned dose and tolerated the lower dose for at least one cycle of therapy. The patient 
must have undergone a disease evaluation and been found appropriate to continue on study. 
(e.g. A patient on Tena lisib [ADDRESS_1102398] one cycle of 
therap y. Similar is the case for Romidepsin )  
 
The new higher dose must be a dose that has completed evaluation and has not exceeded the 
MTD. T he dose escalation can occur at the start of a new cycle. At the discretion of 
investigator, dose escalation may be don e in patient who received lower doses (de -
escalation) due to safety reasons.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Alternative Dosing Cohorts  
Depending on nature and timing of the toxicities , pharmacokinetic data of 
Tenalisib/Romidepsin , alternative dosing regimens and schedules may be examin ed. If in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984] , observed toxicities (DLTs and/or non -dose limiting adverse events 
of concern) are likely to have resulted from a continuous exposure to the study drug or 
cumulative effect, alternative dosing regimens or sc hedules ma y be explored. The SRC  will 
determine an alternative schedule, based on PK data, nature and timing of toxicities, and the 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                       Rhizen Pharmaceuticals S.A.

Guideline for Administration of Romidepsin:  
• Method of administration: Romidepsin  will be administered as an intravenous infusion 
in outpatient basis/ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].  
• Pre-medications:   
o Nausea and vomiting are common following treatment with Romidepsin , therefore 
prophylactic antiemetics  are recommended for all patients.  Advise patie nts to 
report these symptoms so that appropriate treatment can be instituted the earliest.  Due 
to potential for CYP3A4 interaction, administration of a neurokinin -1 receptor 
inhibitor antiemetics (e.g. aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) is not permitted.  
o Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden are at the risk of tumor 
lysis syndrome, therefore these patients are advised to maintain high fluid intake  for 
at least 72 hours after each dose.  
• Serum potassium and magnesium should be ≤ ULN before Ro midepsin treatment.  
• Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1, Day [ADDRESS_1102407] management.  
• All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
• Romidepsin should be infused over 4 hours.  Sites should make every effort to target 
infusion timing to be as close to 4 hours as possible. However, given the variability of 
infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted.  
• Romidepsin must be stored as per presc ribing information. . 
• Prescribing information should be referred for specific instructions for Romidepsin  
reconstitution, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration.

3.4.5 Precautions and Risks Associated with Investigational Products  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tenalisib  
Monitoring of liver enzymes and levels of TSH, T3, and T4  in subjects receiving Tenalisib  
is recommended  based on target organ toxicity . Patients will be monitored for  increased 
ALT/AST,  skin rash, neutropenia as these are reported with Tenalisib . In additi on, enteritis 
(colitis), pneumonia /pneumonitis as these events are reported with other PI3K inhibitors .  
 
Tenalisib  elicit s no photo instability upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiations. However, 
in absence of in  vitro data, possibility of photo -toxici ty with Tenalisib  cannot be ruled out.  
 
Tenalisib  shows inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme. Therefore, concomitant administration of 
Tenalisib  with predominant CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. calcium channel blockers, warfarin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], macrolide antibiotics, lovastatin, simvastatin, terfenadine) may reduce 
clearance of these drugs increasing the risk of adverse events. Similarly, as Tenalisib  is 
inhibited by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and CYP2C9, there is possibility of drug interaction wit h inhibitors 
or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. If concomitant treatment of these drugs are clinically 
warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised.  Strong inhibitor or inducers should 
be avoided as directed in Section on prohibited medication . Please  refer to the recent 
Investigator Brochure for additional safety information .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Romidepsin  
The following adverse events have been reported in patients receiving Romidepsin : 
o Myelosuppression: Romidepsin can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia 
and lymphopenia), and anemia; monitor blood counts during treatment with  
Romidepsin ; interrupt and/or modify the dose as necessary.  
o Fatal and serious infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and viral rea ctivation, 
including Epstein Barr and Hepatitis B viruses, have been reported in clinical trials with 
Romidepsin .  These can occur during treatment and within [ADDRESS_1102409] lymphocyte antigens and in 
patients with disease involvement of the bone marrow.  
o Several treatment -emergent morphological changes in ECGs (including T -wave and ST -
segment changes) hav e been reported in clinical studies.  The clinical significance of

o Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported to occur in 1% of patients with tumor 
stage CTCL and 2% of patients with Stage III/IV PTCL.  Patients with advanced st age 
disease and/or high tumor burden are at greater risk, should be closely monitored, and

Initial disease assessment by [CONTACT_566171] (baseline scan) must be performed within 28 
days prior to C1D1. The site investigator /designee  must review radiological images to 
confirm the subject has measurable disease as defined in the inclusion criteria. D isease 
assessments or scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use 
as the screening scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within [ADDRESS_1102448] dose of trial treatment.  
 
• PTCL and CTCL patients wi th lymph node/visceral involvement:  
Computed tomography (CT) scan (chest/abdomen/pelvis/neck as appropriate) will be 
performed at screening for disease assessment. PET -CT is preferred for FDG -avid 
lymphomas. Other radiological evaluations (e.g. X -ray/MRI/ USG) will be performed if 
warranted.   
 
• CTCL patients with skin and blood involvement:  
CT scan will be performed at screening for disease assessment.  
o In patients with clinically early  disease (maximum/current T 1-2N0M0B0-1), repeat scans 
should not be per formed except in cases of an objective response (OR) in the skin . 
o In those patients  with more advanced disease at baseline (TNMB > T 1-2N0M0B0-1), CT 
scan should be performed at the time of PR and CR in the skin; any time there is a  
question of new or PD in the lymph nodes or viscera; and at end of study.

7.1 Adverse Events  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_799231] (see Section  7.1.2 ).  It is Sponsor 
responsibility to report relevant SAEs to the applicable regulatory body.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1102475] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavourable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a n investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product.    
 
7.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
All adverse events of any patient during the course of the trial will be reported in the case report 
form, and the investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_799232] (i.e., whether the event is rel ated or unrelated  to trial drug administration).  If 
the adverse event is serious, it should be reported immediately t o Sponsor. Other untoward events 
occurring in the framework of a clinical trial are also to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur 
prior to assignment of trial treatment that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run -in). 
 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to Tenalisib /Romidepsin , spanning from the

likely to improve because of the underlying disease. In this case, the investigators must record his 
or her reas oning for this decision in the patient’s medical recor d and as a comment on the eCRF. 
After 30 days of completion of protocol -specific treatment or discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, or 
deaths assessed by [CONTACT_799261]. 
 
7.2 Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Causality Assessment  
Causality is assessing the relationship of the trial treatment to the adverse event. For this study, the 
causality assessment will be categorized as related and not related.  
 
• Related:  All tox icities should be considered to be related to Tenalisib /Romidepsin  unless there 
is a clear alternative explanation.    
• Not related:   If there is no temporal association, or another etiology has been identified as the 
cause, or the trial treatment cannot be implicated based upon the current information.

Original version : [ADDRESS_1102478] 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 88 7.3 Serious Adverse Events  
7.3.1 Definitions of Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of serious adverse events (SAEs) are given below. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_799233].  
 
An SAE or reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is 
immediately life -threaten ing, requires at least a 24 -hour in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76260], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
 
The definition of SAE also include s any important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment 
should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such 
as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the previous definition.  These should also usually be con sidered serious. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an e mergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Progression of malignancy (including fatal 
outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_799262] (for example, as per Lugano 
classification 2014), should not be reported as a serious adverse event.   
 
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although i f any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Outpatient or same -day surgery units  
• Observation or short -stay in unit or short stay to facilitate PK blood draws  
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64341]  
• Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respi[INVESTIGATOR_799234] a pre -planned surgical or medical procedure (one which is  
planned prior to entry in the trial  or planne d in advance and not related to the study procedure/ 
drug), does not require reporting as a serious adverse event to the Sponsor.  
 
7.3.2 SAE Reporting by [CONTACT_799263] “serious” and “severe” adverse events, as the terms are  not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea which persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  O n the other hand, a stroke which 
results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, b ut would be 
considered an SAE. Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording 
AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the S AE Report Form.  
 
Adverse events classified by [CONTACT_799264] s ponsor in order to comply with regulatory requirements.  Serious adverse events may

regardless of causality, within [ADDRESS_1102480] be 
reported to the Sponsor as SAEs on the SAE Report and followed until resolution (with autopsy 
report if applicable).  
 
Deaths and other SAEs occurring > [ADDRESS_1102481] trial treatment that are deemed related 
to Tenalisib /Romidepsin  must be reported as SAEs on the SAE Report within [ADDRESS_1102482] 
knowledge o f the event by [CONTACT_14209] (with an autopsy report if 
available).  Deaths occurring > [ADDRESS_1102483] trial treatment and not attributed to trial 
treatment (e.g.,  disease progression) need not be reported as SAEs,  but simply captured on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
 
The SAE Report Form should be sent to the sponsor/sponsor representative via fax or e -mail within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The detailed SAE reporting process will be reviewed 
with sites during the site initiation visit as well as provided on the SAE report itself. Transmission 
of the SAE report should be confirmed by [CONTACT_14210]. Follow -up 
information for SAEs and information on non -serious AEs that become serious sh ould also be 
reported to Sponsor as soon as it is available; these reports should be submitted using the SAE 
Report Form.   
 
Investigators must report SAEs and follow -up information to their responsible IRB/IEC  according 
to the policies of the responsible IRB/IEC . 
 
7.3.3 Sponsor ’s SAE Reporting Requirements  
Sponsor/Sponsor representative  is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to t he competent 
authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance 
with ICH guidelines, FDA regulations, and/or local regulatory requirements.  
 
Sponsor/sponsor representative is responsible for reporting unexpec ted fatal or life -threatening 
events associated with the use of the trial drugs to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities 
via telephone or fax within 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.   
 
The Sponsor will report all related, unex pected SAEs, including non -death/non -life-threatening 
related unexpected SAEs associated with the use of the trial medications to the FDA by a written 
safety report within 15 calendar days of notification. Reporting to the IRB/IEC  will be done 
according to  institutional policy.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1102484] medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or SAEs on 
the SAE Report Forms and AE eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. All AEs, including 
those that meet SAE rep orting criteria, should be recorded on the AE eCRF; AEs that meet the

Original version : [ADDRESS_1102485] 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 88 definition of an SAE should additionally be reported following the procedures noted in above 
sections.  
 
7.4.1 Diagnosis vs. Signs and  Symptoms  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_432644], the AEs constitute components 
of a recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter cas e, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time 
of reporting, each individual e vent should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the 
relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF). If a diagnosis is subsequently established, 
it should be reported as follow -up information is available. If a diagnosis is determined subsequen t 
to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect 
the diagnosis.  
 
7.4.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
time points. Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the 
AE eCRF, irrespective of severity. ( E.g. If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in 
severity, it should be recorded once with highest grade of severity on a SAE Report Form and/or 
AE eCRF).   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent events  should be recorded separately on an SAE Report Form 
and/or AE  eCRF.  
 
7.4.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Any grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities or any clinically significant grade 1 or 2 hematology or 
biochemistry laboratory value(s) should be recorded as an AE. Isolated laboratory abnormality 
without clinical significance should not be captured as AE if confirmed by [CONTACT_093]. If an 
abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign 
or symptom should be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should 
be considered addit ional information that must be collected on the relevant eCRF. If the laboratory 
abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE 
Report Form or AE eCRF.  
 
7.4.4 Deaths  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specif ied AE reporting period that are attributed by [CONTACT_206855] “Trial Discontinuation” eCRF  
and should not be reported as a SAE . All other on- trial deaths, regardless of attribution, will be 
recorded on an SAE Report and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor.  
 
When recording a serious adverse event with an outcome of death, the event or condition that 
caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should  be recorded as the single medical concept on the 
SAE report and Adverse Event page  of the eCRF. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be 
ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Death NOS” on the CRF Adverse Event page.

Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] >24 hours or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_799235]. There 
are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_799236] s that do not require reporting as an SAE when there is no 
occurrence of an AE. (See  section 7.3 )  
 
7.4.6 Pre-existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the trial.  Such cond itions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF. A pre -existing medical condition should 
be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens 
during the trial. When recording such events on an SAE  Report Form and/or AE  eCRF, it is 
important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_799265]. 
 
7.4.7 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/ Congenital Anomalies  
Pregnancy, abortion, birth defects, and congenital anomalies are events of special interest.  Please 
refer to pregnancy Section  7.5.[ADDRESS_1102487] developed after the inclusion  of the patient into 
the study.  They do not include new lesions of the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the 
new lesions itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease 
progression.  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_1102488], and will need to be reported expeditiously.  
 
7.5.1 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth defects/ Congenital anomalies  
Female patients who are not of child -bearing potential (see  Appendix B ) and female patients of 
child -bearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test within 72  hours prior to  C1D1 are 
eligible for the study. F emale patients of child -bearing potential (see  Appendix B )), and all male 
partners must consent to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the study 
period and for [ADDRESS_1102489] that they may be 
pregnant (a missed or late menstrual period should be reported to the treating investigator).

If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant pr ior to administration of trial drug(s), 
the trial drug(s) must be withheld until the result of t he pregnancy test is confirmed.  If a pregnancy 
is confirmed, the patient must not receive any trial drug(s), and must be discontinued from the trial. 
The outcom e of the pregnancy will be monitored as outlined in Appendix B . 
 
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant after the patient has been receiving trial 
drug(s), the trial drug(s) must immediately be withheld until th e result of t he pregnancy test is 
confirmed. If a pregnancy is confirmed, the trial drug(s) must be immediately and permanently 
stopped, the patient must be discontinued from the trial, and the investigator must notify the 
Medical Monitor and Sponsor Repre sentative as soon as possible. If a patient becomes pregnant 
while enrolled in the trial, a Pregnancy Form should be completed and faxed to the Sponsor.  The 
outcome of the pregnancy will be monitored as outlined in Appendix B . 
    
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always  meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously descri bed process for SAE reporting. A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to reflect 
the outcome of the pregnancy.  
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_1102491] that is 
considered both excessive and medically important. For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be 
defined as any dose exceeding the proposed dose of Tenalisi b (e.g. > [ADDRESS_1102492] coho rt) and/or 
prescribed dose for Romidepsin .   
 
Symptomatic and non -symptomatic overdose must be reported in the CRF.  Any accidental or 
intentional overdose with the trial treatment that is symptomatic, even if not fulfilling a  seriousness 
criterion, is to be reported to the Sponsor immediately as an AE . All symptomatic overdose, 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion, is to be reported as an SAE as per the SAE reporting procedure.  
For patients who experience overdose, treatment sho uld consist of supportive  therapy.  A decision 
to interrupt treatment or dose reduction to be taken depending on the symptoms.  
 
7.6  Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
All toxicities should be considered to be related to either Tenalisib / Romidepsin  combination or 
to either Tenalisib  or Romidepsin  individually unless there is a clear alternative explanation.  
Toxicity will be considered dose -limiting if it occurs during the first cycle (2 8 days) treatment 
and is considered related to the combination . Toxicity will be assessed utilizing the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0. Dose -
limiting toxicities are defined as the following:  
 
7.6.1 Hematological DLTs  
• Grade 4 neutropenia that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 3 within 14 days with supportive treatment 
(e.g. growth factors) OR Grade ≥3 Febrile neutropenia (ANC <1000/µL with fever >38.5ºC 
[101ºF] that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 14 days with supportive  treatment.

7.6.2 Non-Hematological DLTs  
• Grade ≥3 non -hematologic toxicity  that could not be controlled or prevented by [CONTACT_799266] s with exception of:  
• Grade ≥3 ALT/AST elevation that resolves to ≤ Grade 2 within 14 days;  
• Grade ≥3 diarrhea that improves ≤ Grade 2 within 48 hours or Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1102494] not received optimal treatment with anti -diarrhoeal drug s.  
• Grade ≥[ADDRESS_1102495] therapeutic dose of

• Single epi[INVESTIGATOR_119988] ≥3 infusion reaction.  
• Grade 3 nausea, Grade 3 asthenia  or Grade 2 alopecia .  
• Treatment delay of ≥14 days due to unresolved toxicity.  
Adverse events meeting the above def initions but unrelated to study drug  will not be considered 
DLTs. In some instances  (e.g. in case of pre -existent Grade 2 toxicity) , an event may fall within 
the protocol definition of a DLT but will not be considered a DLT (i.e., not clinically 
meaningful/significant or relevant to the combination). In such cases, the SRC will thoroughly 
review the event, supporting data, and the reasons for not considering the event a DLT will be 
clearly documented with supporting rationale. Conversely, other ev ents which do not meet the 
definition of a DLT but are concerning to the SRC may be considered as DLTs.  
 
7.6.[ADDRESS_1102496] met the 
minimum safety e valuation requirements of the study, and/or who have experienced a DLT. The 
data of at least 3 patients will be required for DLT assessment.  
• DLT assessment period will be 2 8-days (inclusive) (will begin on C1D1 and end on C2D1), 
unless extended by [CONTACT_7195].  
• Patients must have been treated with at least [ADDRESS_1102497] a DLT.  
• Patients experienc ing DLT after initiating combination will be considered evaluable 
regardless of the number of doses received  (Please note Romidepsin alone will be 
administered on  Day 1, therefore patient will not be considered for MTD assessment if  
patient develop s DLT on these days) .  
If a patient withdraw s from the study during Cycle 1 due to any reason other than DLT (e.g. 
disease progression or consent withdrawal) and does not  meet the minimum requirements for 
inclusion in the MTD -determining population described above  will be replaced.   
 
7.6.4 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
The MTD is the highest dose of the combination at which 0 of 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients  
experience a DLT during 1  cycle (2 8 days) of therapy. If 2 or more patients in a dosing group 
experience a DLT, the MTD has been exceeded.

Note:  If cytopenia events are deemed related to the underl ying disease rather than either 
Tenalisib  or Romidepsin , dose reduction will be done as per the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients who experience either a DLT or an adverse event meeting DLT criteria (that occurs after 
the DLT assessment window) will be allowed to delay dosing in order to recover from the toxicity. 
Patients may resume Tenalisib , provided that the toxicity has  resolved to Grade ≤2 or baseline. If 
study drug is delayed >2 weeks due to drug toxicity , treatment initiation should be discussed and 
agreed with the Medical Monitor . 
 
Dose reductions will be permanent.  A dose re -escalation are not permitted for patients  who 
previously had a dose reduction. Holidays from study drug are discouraged. Any patient in whom 
similar toxicity recurs at the reduced dose should be discontinued from further Tenalisib  treatment. 
Note: In e xception al case, a patient may be allowed fol lowing a careful assessment of benefit and 
risk by [CONTACT_799267].  
 
7.7.1 Criteria for Re-Starting Tenalisib  after Drug toxicity  
Treatment continu ation in the study is at the discretion of the treating Investigator. In the absence 
of unacceptable toxicities or disease progression, patients may continue treatment with Tenalisib  
as long as:  
• Absolute neutrophil count has returned to baseline, or >750/µL.  Platelet count is >50,000/µL.  
• Recovered from grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicity to grade 2 or baseline (excluding 
alopecia). Treatment may be delayed for up to 2 weeks to recover from toxicity.  
• No clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression.  
• If treatment is  delayed > [ADDRESS_1102499] .  
• In case the investigator determines the events to be related to Romidepsin , Tenalisib  can be 
continued depending on toxicity at discretion  of investigator.  
• Similarly, i n case the investigator determines the events to be related to  Tenalisib , 
Romidepsin  can be continued depending on toxicity at discretion  of investigator.  
• In case the event is possibly related to Romidepsin  as well as Tenalisib , the most conservative 
approach  of dose modification should be used.

7.7.3 Romidepsin  Dose Modifications  
If toxicity, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is attributable to Romidepsin, the guideline for 
Romidepsin dose modification should be followed. Final discretion is with the treating investigator 
in regards to aggressive dose reductions, as well as the n umber of dose reductions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hematologic Toxicity  
• Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia: Treatment with romidepsin should be delayed 
until the specific cytopenia returns to ANC ≥1.5×109/L and platelet count ≥75×109/L or 
baseline, then therapy may be restarted at same dose . 
• Grade 4 febrile (≥ 38.5ºC) neutropenia or thrombocytopenia that requires platelet transfusion: 
Treatment with romidepsin should be delayed until the specific cytopenia returns to ≤ Grade 1 
or baseline, and then the dose should be pe rmanently reduced to 10 mg/m2 or lower dose . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-Hematologic Toxicities  
Nonhematologic toxicities except alopecia  
• Grade 2 or 3 toxicity: Treatment with romidepsin should be delayed until toxicity returns to ≤ 
Grade 1 or baseline, then therapy may be restarted at same dose. If Grade 3 toxicity recurs, 
treatment with romidepsin should be delayed until toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline and 
the dose should be permanently reduced to 10 mg/m2 or lower.  
• Grade 4 toxicity: Treatment with romidepsin sh ould be delayed until toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 
1 or baseline, then the dose should be permanently reduced to 10 mg/m2 or lower dose.  
• Romidepsin should be discontinued if Grade 3 or 4 toxicities recur after dose reduction.  
 
 
8 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
8.1 Specification of the Efficacy Parameters  
Evaluable for objective response:  Patients who have had a pre -treatment baseline efficacy 
evaluation and at least one post -treatment efficacy evaluation will be considered evaluable for 
response. “Investig ator assessed response”  will be used in the study. These patients will have 
their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
 
Disease parameters:  
• Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured 
in at least two dimensions with conventional techniques (PET/CT, MRI, x -ray) or a s >1.[ADDRESS_1102511] scan. All tumor measurements should be recorded in centimeters.   
 
• Non-measur able disease (evaluable disease):  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including 
small lesions, (<[ADDRESS_1102512] scan) are considered non -measurable disease. Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangiti s, and cystic 
lesions are all non -measurable.  
  
• Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 6 lesions total, representative of all 
involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. 
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                         Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA  
Amendment 1: 30 November 2018  
Original version : [ADDRESS_1102513] 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 88 Target lesions s hould be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest SPD 
diameter), and the highest SUV avidity (high SUV lesions may be prioritized even if not the 
largest lesions, and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_799268]). A baseline sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. The baseline sum of the diameters will be use d as reference to further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
• Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the [ADDRESS_1102514] objective r esponse: The best objective response is the best response recorded 
from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence .  
 
8.2 Response Evaluations and Measurements  
In all patients (PTCL and CTCL), the response will be assessed approximately at [ADDRESS_1102515] two assessments [(e.g. C3D1 (± 7 days), C5D1 (± 7 days) ] and then at C8D1 (± 7 da ys) 
and/ or at the EOT  or as clinically indicated (if clinical progression is suspected).  
 
• PTCL  
PTCL patients will be evaluated according to Lugano classification Cheson 2014 )[16] (Appendix C) 
using the CT scan. PET -CT will be preferred for FDG -avid lymphomas.  The modality chosen 
should be the same through out the duration of the study. In addition, PET-CT will be performed  at 
C3D1 (± 7 days) and to confirm C R. If PET and CT scan at Screening are negative for disease 
involvement in the neck, subsequent CT scans may not include neck. If PET and CT scans at 
Screening are positive for disease involvement of the neck, subsequent CT scans must include neck. 
Disease as sessments and imaging should not be delayed for delays in cycle starts.   Disease 
assessments and imaging should be continued until documented disease progression, the start of 
new anti -cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the study , whichever occurs 
first.  
 
Each participating site will be responsible for radiological review and confirmation of response as 
per standard efficacy guidelines. The frequency outlined is the minimum required for study 
participation. Patients who progress according to the corresponding criteria will receive no further 
treatment. Patients who respond to the treatment (i.e., CR, PR or SD) may remain on trial. All 
disease specific assessments are to be completed as applicable to disease type.  
 
• CTCL:  
CTCL pat ients will be evaluated as per modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT)  
(Appendix F ). [17]  Additionally, CT scan will be done  in the CTCL  patients with lymph node and 
viscera l involvement . CTCL patients with subcutaneous lesions which cannot be measured by 
[CONTACT_799269] -CT avid lesions.  Bone marrow biopsy will be 
performed in patients with B2 blood involvement.  In these patients, Sezary cell count will be 
quantified by [CONTACT_799247]/bone marrow.  
Protocol No.  RP6530+Romidepsin -1805                                                         Rhizen Pharmaceuticals SA

9 STATISTICAL METHOD AND CONSIDERATIONS   
This section describes the statistical methods to be used to analyze efficacy and safety. These 
methods may be revised and updated due to reasons such as regulatory requirements or need for 
further clarifications. The final analysis plan will be documented in a formal statistical analysis 
plan (SAP) that must be finalized before databas e lock. The SAP will include details on how 
variables will be derived, how missing data will be handled, and how data will be presented as well 
as the details on statistical methods to be used for safety and efficacy analyses. The final clinical 
study repo rt will discuss deviations from the SAP, if any.

at the overall 5% level of significance.  The primary efficacy endpoint for the P hase II trial will be 
evaluated at a one -sided 5% level.  No adjustment for Type I error rate will be required because 
the study has only one primary endpoint with one comparison.  P -values will be rounded to three 
decimal places.  If a p -value is less tha n 0.001 it will be reported as “<0.001”.  
 
Continuous data will be described using the following descriptive statistics: n, mean, median, 
minimum and maximum. Data will be displayed in all listings sorted by [CONTACT_16303], group and patient 
number.  When count data are presented, the percentage will be suppressed when the count is zero 
in order to draw attention to the non -zero counts.  A row denoted “Missing” will be included in 
count tabulations where necessary to account for dropouts and m issing values.  Unless otherwise 
specified, the denominator for percentages will be the number of patients with a non -missing 
assessment in a given treatment group within the analysis population of interest.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using  SAS 9.1 or higher.  
 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size  
Part 1:  In Dose Escalation, three patients per cohort are considered appropriate for the assessment 
of overall safety and tolerability and for providing adequate confidence for dose escalation. No 
formal sa mple size and power analysis is done. Accordingly, total 2 -18 patients will be enrolled in 
3 escalating cohorts unless additional dose levels are required to reach MTD/ optimal dose. Optimal 
dose will be determined by [CONTACT_12217].  
 
Part 2:  Total 24 patients with relapsed/refractory TCL will be enrolled in two groups (12 patients 
in each group). Twelve patients per group is considered appropriate for assessment of preliminary 
anti-tumor activity of the combination.  However, t he SRC may modify the sample size du e to 
unforeseen clinical situations.  
 
9.3 Study Population  
The following 3 analysis populations are planned for this study:

9.4.1 Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.  
 
9.4.2 Safety Analyses  
The safety endpoints will include:  
• Incidence of DLTs   
• Incidence of AEs and related AEs  
• Incidence of grade 3  and grade 4 AEs   
• Incidence of SAEs  and death  
• Laboratory values  
• ECG/vital signs  
The safety endpoints will be listed and/or summarized by [CONTACT_42376]. No inferential statistical 
analyses will be performed.  
 
The analyses of safety will be based on the frequency of adverse events and their severity for 
patients in each portion who received at least one dose of study treatment. Worst toxicity grades 
per patient will be tabulated for select adverse events and laboratory measurements by [CONTACT_206866] v 5.0. 
 
9.4.3 Efficacy analyses  
The efficacy endpoints  will include:  
• ORR: The percentages of CR, CR+PR, and CR+PR+SD as well as Conversion Rate for Group 
2 will be presented, as will the median duration of response. The 95% confidence intervals of 
these percentages may also be presented.    
• DOR : DOR is define d as time from the initial response to documented disease progression . This 
variable will be analyzed via Kaplan -Meier  methodology.  
Additional analyses may also be performed as appropriate.  
These analyses will be performed from time to time for presentatio n/publication purposes.  
 
9.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The PK parameters (e.g. AUC (0-∞), AUC (0- t), Cmax, tmax, λz, and t ½) will be assessed by [CONTACT_799270]; and Romidepsin  plasma concentrations during the dose escalation 
phase of the study. These variables will be summarized by n, mean  (both arithmetic and geometric 
if applicable) , standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum by [CONTACT_2715].

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 88 Appendix B: Contraceptive Guidelines and Pregnancy  
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are defined as Follows  
Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 
months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age 
appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous a menorrhea with 
serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without 
hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6492] u p hormone level assessment 
is she considered not of child bearing potential.  
Contraceptive Guidelines for Women of Child -Bearing Potential  
Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highl y effective contraception during the study and for 5 T1/2 (48 hrs) plus 
an additional 4 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056] . The highly effective contraception is defined as 
either:  
1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of  the subject. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
2. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or 
tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_96036].  
3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the  
absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male 
partner should be the sole partner for that patient.  
4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):  
a. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  
b. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or   
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.  
The following are unacceptable  forms of contraception for women of childbearing potential:  
• Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as Tenalisib  
may potentially decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.  
• IUD progesterone T  
• Female condom  
• Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
• Fertility awareness  
• Withdrawal  
• Cervical shield  
 
Women of child -bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test ≤ 72 
hours prior to initiating treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 88 * A score of [ADDRESS_1102548] treatment, especially if at the  time of an 
interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider 
a score of 3 as inadequate responses  (to avoid under treatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest 
dominant n odes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes 
should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and 
retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions incl ude those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI 
involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. Non measured lesions: Any disease not selected as 
measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considere d not measured. These sites include 
any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the 
requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is  any 
site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural 
effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be 
confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_232394]. In Waldeyer's ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, bone marrow), 
FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response, but should be no higher 
than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activa tion as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid 
growth factors).  
† PET 5PS: 1, no uptake above background; 2, uptake ≤ mediastinum; 3, uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver; 4, 
uptake moderately > liver; 5, uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions; X, new areas of uptake unlikely 
to be related to lymphoma.

Complete physical examination including  
• Determination of type(s) of skin lesions  
o If only patch/plaque disease or erythroderma, then estimate percentage of body surface area involved 
and note any ulceration of lesions  
o If tumors are present, determine total number of lesions, aggregate volume, largest size lesion, and 
regions of the body involved  
• Identification of any palpable lymph node, especially those >1.[ADDRESS_1102550] diameter or firm, 
irregular, clustered, or fixed  
• Identification of any organomegaly  
 
Skin biopsy  
• Most indurated area if only one biopsy  
• Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_206821]: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, 
and a B -cell marker such as CD20. CD30 may also be indicated in cases where lymphomatoid 
papulosis, anaplastic lymphoma, or l arge-cell transformation is considered.  
• Evaluation for clonality of TCR gene rearrangement  
 
Blood tests  
• CBC with manual differential, liver function tests, LDH, comprehensive chemistries  
• TCR gene rearrangement and relatedness to any clone in skin  
• Analysis for abnormal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_5640] Sézary cell count with determination absolute number 
of Sézary cells and/or flow cytometry (including CD4+/CD7 - or CD4+/CD26 -) 
 
Radiologic tests  
• In patients with T1N0B0stage disease who are otherwise healthy and without c omplaints directed to a 
specific organ system, and in selected patients with T2N0B0disease  
• with limited skin involvement, radiologic studies may be limited to a chest X -ray or ultrasound of the 
peripheral nodal groups to corroborate absence of adenopathy  
• In all patients with other than presumed stage IA disease, or selected patients with limited T2  disease 
and the absence of adenopathy or blood involvement, CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
alone±FDG -PET scan are recommended to further eval uate any potential lymphadenopathy, visceral 
involvement, or abnormal laboratory tests. In patients unable to safely undergo CT scans, MRI may 
be substituted.  
 
Lymph node biopsy  
• Excisional biopsy is indicated in those patients with a node that is either ≥ 1.5 cm in diameter and/or 
is firm, irregular, clustered, or fixed  
• Site of biopsy  
o Preference is given to the largest lymph node draining an involved area of the skin or if FDG -PET 
scan data are available, the node with highest standardized uptake value (SUV ). 
o If there is no additional imaging information and multiple nodes are enlarged and otherwise equal in 
size or consistency, the order of preference is cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas.  
• Analysis: pathologic assessment by [CONTACT_13425], flow cytome try, and TCR gene rearrangement.

Stage I  
Either of the following means the disease is stage I:  
• The lymphoma is in only 1 lymph node area or lymphoid organ such as the thymus 
(I). 
• The cancer is found only in 1 area of a single organ outside of the lymph system 
(IE). 
 
Stage II  
Either of the following means the disease is stage II: 
• The lymphoma is in 2 or more groups of lymph nodes on the same side of (above 
or below) the diaphragm (the thin band of muscle that separates the chest and 
abdomen). For example, this might include nodes in the underarm and neck area 
but not the combin ation of underarm and groin nodes (II).  
• The lymphoma extends from a single group of lymph node(s) into a nearby [CONTACT_90628] 
(IIE). It may also affect other groups of lymph nodes on the same side of the 
diaphragm.  
 
Stage III  
Either of the following means the dise ase is stage III:  
• The lymphoma is found in lymph node areas on both sides of (above and below) 
the diaphragm.  
• The cancer may also have spread into an area or organ next to the lymph nodes 
(IIIE), into the spleen (IIIS), or both (IIISE).  
 
Stage IV  
Either of  the following means the disease is stage IV:  
• The lymphoma has spread outside of the lymph system into an organ that is not 
right next to an involved node.  
• The lymphoma has spread to the bone marrow, liver, brain or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or the 
pleura (thin lining of the lungs).  
Other modifiers may also be used to describe the lymphoma stage:

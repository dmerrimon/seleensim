2  INTRODUCTION  
 
OVERVIEW  
In January 2023, The Policy & Research Group (PRG) submitted its Analysis Plan for the 
evaluation of the Momentary Affect Regulation Safer Sex Intervention  (MARSSI) to Mathematica. 
In May 2023, Mathematica provided feedback to PRG on the plan.  
 
In an effort to provide detail to other reviewers of this Analysis Plan (who may have similar 
questions ), we include  brief responses to key questions raised by [CONTACT_78306].  
 
Reporting plan. In light of the number of research questions specified below, we want to be clear  
on how we intend to report findings from this evaluation. Our first priority will be to report results 
relevant to the three  primary research questions using our benchmark analytic approach . This may 
include additional analyses , as needed , to clarify any analytical complications that invariably arise 
in the analysis of the impacts of complex social programs . We have noted some potential 
complexities in this Analysis Plan. Although it is not a requirement for an RCT with low attrition, 
we will include baseline  equivalence statistics for each of the analytic samples used to produce 
findings for the three primary research questions . We may opt to include findings from secondary 
and exploratory research questions  if we find that they  elucidate  or supplement  the primary 
research  findings .  
 
We have asked an array of secondary and exploratory questions that aim to investigate hypothetical 
relationships that undergird MARSSI’s theory of change. These questions have been designated as 
subordinate  because are not reviewable by [CONTACT_78307] , because they are ancillary  in 
the theory of change, or because they are not  yet understood as confirmatory in the eyes of the 
program’s developers. We investigate these questions to test hypothesized relationships and 
develop our theoretical understanding of how MARSSI works. Findings to  these questions are 
necessarily of interest to the developers of MARSSI , but may also be generally informative to the 
field in terms of how a complex intervention like MARSSI influences behavior change. We will 
report results with interpretation  to the program developers for future development and theory 
refinement.  We may also  choose to disseminate exploratory results more broadly in the form of 
peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, or possibly shorter briefs.  
 
Modification to benchmark analytic approach.  After receiving written feedback from and 
discussing options for a  benchmark analytic approach  with peer reviewers , we have decided  to 
estimate impacts using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regression  for each of our three primary 
outcome s. We will use  count models  as sensitivity tests  to test the robustness of those estimates . 
Any substantive differences between benchmark and sensitivity estimates  will be reported in the 
results section of our impact manuscript.   
 
Correction in the description of blocking variables . In reviewing our analysis plan, we noticed 
that we had mischaracterized  how we intended to construct variables to account for the 
stratification of random assignment procedures in our analytic models . Prior to random allocation, 
participants were stratified sequentially into separate pools  by: [CONTACT_78308] (51 possible options with the inclusion of Washington, 
DC) and the study coordinator who enrolled them into the study (5 options). Operationally, this has 
created separate randomization list s for each state -coordinator combination , for a  maximum 
3  potential set of  255 separate randomization blocks  (51 states * 5 coordinators ). In revising  this plan, 
we have clarified that the dummy blocking variables we intend to include in our analytic models 
reflect this randomization structure.  
 
Rationale for assessing motivation as a short-term outcome. In our list of secondary research 
questions, we indicate that we will assess three outcomes - motivation to use prescription birth 
control,  motivation  to use condoms, and motivation to abstain from sex – at just one time point 
(three  months post -intervention). Our rationale for limiting this assessment to the single time point  
is based on two factors. First, in conversations  with the intervention developer  on the MARSSI 
theory of change , we discussed  how motivation is a behavioral antecedent that likely takes time to 
be realized and isn’t expected  to shift  immediately after receiving an intervention. MARSSI aims to 
first build an individual’s confidence that they can use contraceptives and communicate effectively 
with their sexual partners. Once this confidence has been built,  they may feel more motivated (over 
time) to use contraceptives and/or abstain from risky sex.  
 
Second , we were concerned about both the b urden of response on the participant  and cognizant of 
limiting items to only those most critical to assess at specific time points.  
 
Defining participation threshold for Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) analyses. The 
CACE analyses we intend to conduct (and which are describe d below) are exploratory in nature; 
our intent is not for them to be used as our benchmark approach. Given this, we plan to assess the 
impact of varying levels of  MARSSI  participation  (dosage)  on outcomes of interest  to better 
understand the potential dose -response relationship and do not specify a set threshold for 
participation .  
  
[ADDRESS_85419]  and Program  Implementation  Evaluation  Analysis  Plan  for [LOCATION_011] 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] – June [ADDRESS_85420] Regulation Safer Sex Intervention (MARSSI). Our 
classification of primary and secondary research questions aligns with  categorization rules 
provided in the Instructions For TPP20 Tier [ADDRESS_85421] set of short -term behavioral outcomes as primary, which the program 
devel oper (in consultation with the research team) believes are most important for understanding 
the efficacy of MARSSI to achieve its goal of reducing unplanned pregnancy and STIs in the 
target  population.  Secondary  research  questions  cover  the broader  array  of outcomes  measured  in 
the Participant Questionnaire, as well as alternative analytic methods, that are designed to  
explore the impact of the program on other theoretically important behaviors and antecedents 
within the full sample and subgroups of interest.  
 
a. Primary  research  questions2 
1. What  is the short -term impact  (three  months  post-intervention)  of the offer  to participate 
in MARSSI (treatment) relative to the offer to participate in the control condition on 
participants' reported frequency of having vaginal sex without condoms in the past 30 
days?  
2. What  is the short -term impact  (three  months  post-intervention)  of the offer  to participate 
in MARSSI (treatment) relative to the offer to participate in the control condition on 
participants' reported current use of effective non -barrier contraception?  
3. What  is the short -term impact  (three  months  post-intervention)  of the offer  to participate 
in MARSSI (treatment) relative to the offer to participate in the control condition on 
participants' reported number of sexual partners in the past 3 months?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_85422] study research questions (p3), in order to reduce opportunities for Type I errors and simplify reporting,  
researchers  should  designate  as primary,  research  questions  that are “focused  on the outcomes  most  important  to gauging a program’s 
effectiveness in improving adolescent reproductive health.” Findings for primary research questions are the basis for assessi ng program 
efficacy and “will be used to guide interpretation and conclusions about the effectiveness of the pr ogram being tested.” By [CONTACT_22242], 
“secondary research questions examine impacts on other outcomes (aside from those examined as primary research  questions)  that 
might be  influenced  by [CONTACT_78309].” Guidance (p4)  suggests  that secondary  
outcomes  are not considered  “critical”  to evaluating  effectiveness  but are none  the less important  to key interested parties (e.g., grantee 
or researchers).  
[ADDRESS_85423] sexual  
and reproductive  health  (SRH)  behaviors  targeted  by [CONTACT_78310]. Primary outcomes have been pre -specified in our design summary and the study’s clinicaltrials.gov 
registration ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . 
[ADDRESS_85424]  of MARSSI  on the full analytic  sample  for specified  outcomes  using  an intent - 
to-treat (ITT) framework. The second group of questions will explore the impact of 
MARSSI on specified subgroups, again using an ITT framework. The third group of 
questions will explore the impact of MARSSI using a complier average causal effect 
(CACE) analytic approach.  
 
Outcomes that are starred (*) indicate those for which the construction of the measure 
will result in the formation of an endogenous subgroup because inclusion in the group 
will be defined  by a participant’s  response  to items  at follow -up time points.  We intend 
to use principal stratification analysis to estimate program effects for these measures.

to treatment relative to a similar group of assigned to control?  
 
2. Impact  Study  Design  
This section  provides  a brief  description  of the study  design  and the process  for creating 
intervention and comparison groups.  
 
The BEhavior And Mindfulness Health (BEAM) study is an individual randomized controlled 
trial in which evaluators randomly assign eligible, consenting participants to intervention or 
comparison conditions at a one -to-one ratio. Random assignment occurs after participants’ 
consent and before the provision of any programming or collection of baseline data. 
Following submission of the baseline questionnaire, participants are implicitly informed of 
assignment through  the discussion  of next steps.  Participants  are enrolled  on a rolling  basis  
and randomized by [CONTACT_78316].4 See the Random assignment process 
section below for further details.  
 
The treatment condition, MARSSI, is a motivational interviewing -based intervention 
designed specifically for adolescent and young adult (AYA) biologic females with depressive 
symptoms and  sexual  risk behavior.  It aims  to enhance  motivation  to change  risky  behaviors,  
provide  skills to address depression’s effects on behavior, and prompt and reinforce health -
related affect regulation, cognitive behavioral skill use, and behavior change in daily life. 
MARSSI has three components: 1) a manualized counseling session with a 
sexual/reproductive health (SRH) counselor; 2) a mobile health application (mHealth app); 
and 3) a booster counseling session with the SRH counselor.  
 
The main counseling session lasts ~[ADDRESS_85427] a bachelor’s 
degree  and one  to two years of  experience  working with young people  in SRH  and/or  mental 
health settings. Counselors receive approximately 24 hours of training in the intervention 
through self -study (assigned readings, videos), live sessions with trainers (brief didactic 
 
[ADDRESS_85428] likely seek reproductive health care, regardless of which type of health center.  
8  presentations, discussions,  role plays),  and practice  (with  other  counselors  using  assigned  
participant  scenarios,  and with a mock patient followed by [CONTACT_78317]/de -brief and coaching 
session with trainers).  
 
Participants download the mHealth app onto their personal smartphone during the main 
session; the app is intended to be used four times a day for four weeks. There are three app -
prompted reports and one scheduled report per day. The reports ask the partici pant to report 
their affective states and SRH risk precursors (e.g., self -efficacy to use condoms, to use 
contraceptives, and to refuse sex, desire for sex and reasons). When the participant reports 
poor affect, low contraceptive  or condom  self-efficacy,  pregnancy  desire,  or desire  for sex to 
regulate  affect,  they receive  automated personalized messages prompting healthy behaviors 
and cognitive  behavioral skill use. Intended dosage is approximately two minutes per day.  
 
The booster session is designed to last ~[ADDRESS_85429]  the participant  goal,  and learn  a new skill 
(affirmations).  
 
As originally  developed,  the main  counseling  session  was intended  to be delivered  in 
person, while  the booster  session  was designed  to be delivered  either  in person  or by [CONTACT_78318]. However, in response  to the  COVID -[ADDRESS_85430] cancer; it contains no sexual health content. 
Participants receive a link to the podcast via email and self -administer the intervention on their 
own personal devices.  
 
The study is being conducted virtually and recruiting participants throughout the United 
States. To support recruitment, the study team has partnered with several Planned Parenthood 
(PP) affiliates. Individuals have  the potential to learn about the  study through both active  and 
passive recruitment methods. Active recruitment methods include having PP staff at affiliate 
health centers mention the study to patients and sending text messages and patient portal 
messages directly to patients in PP affiliate heal th systems which have partnered with the 
study. Passive recruitment  methods  include  hanging  posters  and distributing  handbills  at 
affiliate  health  centers and posting information on the PP website notices and study -specific 
or -affiliated social media accounts. All study advertisements contain a QR code and/or link 
to the online self -screener.  
 
When an individual takes the online self -screener, they are automatically notified whether 
they are eligible for the study. If they are eligible, they are routed to a page where they enter 
and submit their contact [CONTACT_3031]. When they submit their contac t information, it is 
immediately  available  to all SRH  counselors  at select  PP affiliates  who are working  on the 
study (study coordinators). Study coordinators self -assign themselves to an eligible individual 
and then use the contact [CONTACT_78319].  
[ADDRESS_85431]  meet  all of the following  criteria:  1) 
biologically able to become pregnant; 2) 16 -21 years of age;5 3) fluent in English; 4) own a 
smartphone; 5)  have the technical capacity to participate; 6) not currently pregnant; 7) not 
trying to become pregnant;  8) not have  given  birth  during  the six months  preceding  eligibility  
screening;  9) not be married or engaged to be married at the time of eligibility screening; 10) 
report having penile - vaginal sex in the past 3 months; 11) report having penile -vaginal sex at 
least once a week, on average; 12) score at least 8 on the PHQ -8 depression screen ing tool;6 
13) self -report visiting a reproductive health provider in the past two years;7 14) report having 
done at least one of the following during the 3 months preceding eligibility screening: a) not 
used a condom every time they had sexual intercourse; b) used condoms, a diaphragm, 
cervical cap, spermicide, sponge, fertility awareness, or withdrawal as a primary form of birth 
control; c) had sexual intercourse with more than one person; d) had sexual intercourse within 
two hours after using drugs or alcohol;  or e) been  treated  for a sexually  transmitted  
infection/disease;  15) consent  to participate in the study; and 16) not identified as fraudulent.8  
The intent -to-treat sample  (ITT)  is comprised  of eligible  individuals  who are enrolled  into 
the study during the enrollment period (June 2021 to April 2023).  
 
a. Random  assignment  process  
i. Unit  of randomization:  Random  assignment  occurs  at the individual  participant  level.  
 
ii. Random assignment procedure:  The Policy & Research Group (PRG) is 
responsible for  all aspects of  random assignment. Random assignment blocks of  
varying sizes assign participants  to treatment  or control  condition  at an equal  (i.e., 1:1) 
assignment  ratio.  PRG produced this allocation list with an existing algorithm 
available in Stata (random allocation command, ralloc ) and did so separately for each 
of the potential [ADDRESS_85432] of unique study IDs for every U.S. state. 
They assign a number (based on the state where the individual would seek 
 
[ADDRESS_85433] two years  with a reproductive  health  provider.  All of these  changes 
were made in an effort to recruit more participants.  
8 Review  of potential  fraudulence  is done  automatically  using  a feature  called  RelevantID  ®, which  is integrated  in the Qualtrics  online 
survey software that the study team uses for data collection. This was added as an eligibility criterion in December 2022, wh en we 
expanded recruitment to individuals who visited any type of reproductive  health provider, in an  effort to  ensure that only truly eligible 
individuals are enrolled into the study.  
9 Blocking  is done  at both the coordinator - and state -level.  Coordinator -level blocking  is used  for administrative  purposes.  State -level 
blocking is used to account for regional differences in the availability of SRH services and population characteristics.

the questionnaire through an online  data collection  platform.  An individual  is 
considered  enrolled  in the study  and part of the ITT sample when they have been given 
a study ID number and completed the baseline questionnaire. Random assignment 
occurs when the unique study ID number is  entered into a field in a web -based 
Randomization Generator . It is at this point that the ID number is associated with an 
assignment condit ion (treatment or control) in the random allocation sequence. At each 
baseline administration (after eligibility is confirmed),  the study  coordinator  types  in 
the ID number  that was next on the list (going in ascending numerical order) into the 
study ID field of the Randomization Generator ; the application then provides a 
message to the study coordinator that indicates the condition associated with that ID. 
While the participant completes the baseline questionnaire, the study coordinator 
records the partici pant’s ID number and allocation into the study’s electronic Consent 
and Enrollment Form . 
 
Study participants are not explicitly informed of which condition (treatment or 
control) they are assigned; however, following their submission of the baseline 
questionnaire, a study coordinator implicitly informs the participant of assignment 
through the discussion of  next steps  (e.g.,  treatment  participants  are provided  with the 
MARSSI  main  counseling session, control participants are provided with information 
for how they can listen to the podcast epi[INVESTIGATOR_78282] a month to complete the first follow -up questionnaire, to be administered 
one month post -baseline). With regards to messaging, the treatment and control 
interventions are never discussed as such; instead, study coordinators are trained to 
acknowledge that participants are randomly assigned to a particular intervention: a 
health program involving one -on-one video sessions with the study coordinator; or a 
health program that involves listening to a [ADDRESS_85434], and that participant  IDs are 
assigned in sequential order as intended.  
 
iii. Probability  of assignment  to treatment  group : The probability  of assignment  to 
the treatment group is intended to be equal to the probability of assignment to the 
control condition; that is, p (assignment to treatment) =.5.  
 
iv. Potential for crossover/contamination: To mitigate potential for both crossover10 
and contamination11, PRG study coordinators are trained in detailed study procedures;

[ADDRESS_85447]  Analysis  
This section lays out plans for cleaning data and handling missing data, constructing outcomes, 
defining  the analytic  sample,  assessing  baseline  equivalence,  addressing  potential  crossover  and 
contamination, and finally the analytic models for estimating program impacts and planned 
sensitivity analyses.  
 
a. Data  cleaning  
Prior to analysis, PRG staff will systematically screen or review the analytic data (baseline and 
outcome) to identify invalid, outlying, missing, and unreliable observations.16 In our benchmark 
approach, new variables are created in which data that are deemed unusable (i.e., invalid) are 
coded as missing and flagged according to missing data type; all other data are retained, 
unchanged.  Missing data that are not invalid will be updated through logical editing when  
possible,  and all missing  covariate  data will be updated  using  dummy  variable  adjustments. 
Details  of our data cleaning  steps  and rationale  for our missing  data approach  are outlined  below. 
In addition,  we will assess  the robustness  of these  analytic  decisions  with sensitivity  analyses  and 
report on any substantive inconsistencies, as detailed in the Sensitivity analyses section.  
 
i. Item -Level Procedures. Data cleaning begins with a thorough review of all 
questionnaire items. The goal of item -level procedures is to prepare data for analytic 
variable  construction.  To this end, we ensure  data are as complete  as possible  and that all 
recorded values are valid.  
 
a. Identify and flag invalid responses : The first step in the data screening process  
is to inspect the data for instances in which responses are invalid because they are 
outside of a pre -determined range of plausible or acceptable values. Each 
questionnaire type (e.g., baseline, follow -up) has a codebook, prepared by a PRG 
staff person, th at contains variable names, pre -specified and valid variable values 
or ranges of values, and when applicable, value labels.[ADDRESS_85448] performs diagnostics in Stata to ensure that values 
for all variables used in analysis are valid (i.e., data are within ranges specified in 
the codebook).  A data analyst inspects the data using two commands in Stata. 
First,  the analyst  uses the command  sum variable_name,  which  provides  summary 
statistics (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for all numeric 
variables. The analyst checks that the minimum and maximum values are valid. If  
this command reveals there are values out of range, the analyst then inspe cts the 
 
16 With regards to the potential for inconsistent responses, during instrument construction, the study team considered what type s of 
questions  may lead to inconsistencies  – both internal  (within  the same  instrument)  and over-time (across  instrument)  inconsistencies. To 
avoid  internal  inconsistencies in our  primary outcomes, we built  skip patterns into  the online  questionnaire. If participants indicate they 
have  not recently had a  particular type of sex,  they are  skipped  out of more  specific questions related  to that type  of sex. If they state  they 
have  not recently  had any sexual  partners,  they are then skipped  out of a question  asking  about  the types  of sexual  partners they have had. 
In addition, participants are precluded  from indicating they had a particular  type of sex without a  condom more  times than they said they 
had that type of sex. Furthermore, given the eligibility criteria for this study require participants to be recently sexually  active, there was 
not a need to ask questions about whether participants have ever had certain types of sex; as a result, there are no items in the instrument 
that offer the potential for over -time inconsistencies to exist.  
17 Regardless as to whether data are nominal, ordinal, or continuous, all response options are coded in Stata as numeric values;  
values are labeled according to corresponding category names when data are nominal or ordinal. As an example, the variable ge nder 
is a nominal variable; however, each response option (female, male, transgender female; transgender male; non - 
binary/gendergueer,  unsure/questioning,  other)  is coded  as a pre-specified,  unique  numeric  value  (1-5). The only acceptable  values 
for this variable then are 1 -7; any other values are out of range.  
 
23  data using  the command, tab variable_name,  missing , which  provides  a frequency 
table of all values (including missing values) so the analyst can identify and flag 
all values that are out of  range  as invalid and recode  these  values to missing (code 
as “.k”).  Data  that are recoded  to missing  are treated  according  to our missing  data 
approach. Briefly, our benchmark approach is to impute missing  baseline data 
and include in analysis; we exclude observations with missing outcome data from 
analysis.  
 
b. Assess missingness: The second step in the data screening process is to assess 
missingness.  In this step, a research  analyst  reviews  and reports  the prevalence  of 
unit and item missingness (which results from nonresponse) for both treatment 
and control samples.  
 
c. Conduct logical data edits: The third step is to determine if logical edits are 
possible for any variables that may have missing values due to skip patterns and 
nonresponse  and logically  edit where  that may be the case.[ADDRESS_85449] true (or plausible) values or potentially a result o f measurement error. The only 
variables for which we inspect outliers are those used in the construction of our outcome 
variables (frequency of having vaginal sex, frequency of having vaginal sex without 
condoms, frequency of having vaginal sex without bei ng protected by [CONTACT_78337], frequency of using emergency contraception after vaginal sex, 
frequency  of having  vaginal  sex using  both a condom  and prescription  birth  control  at the 
same time, frequency of having oral sex, freque ncy of having anal sex, frequency of 
having anal sex without condoms, frequency of  using drugs or  alcohol before  any type  of 
sex, and number of sexual partners) because they have no upper limit (all other variables 
used in analysis are either categorical or have predicated upper and lower bounds). Our 
approach is to identify and flag influential observations in our data.  
 
Our benchmark analytic approach is to include data flagged as outliers in analysis, 
because we  do not know for  certain whether  the values are  true or invalid. However, we 
also run sensitivity  analyses  that exclude  these  data and report  substantive  differences  in 
the results section of the report.  
 
iii. Instrument level procedures. Once analytic variables have been constructed and 
reviewed,  we review  entire  cases  to determine  if they are reliable  and conduct  dummy 
variable adjustment on our baseline analytic variables.  
 
18 PRG’s  general  approach  to logically  editing  a specific  variable  is to use as few other  variables  as possible.  Variables  that are missing due 
to a skip pattern are updated to their logical value of zero. For variables in which an item should have been answered but was not, we 
use only the variable that directly preceded it to update its value.  
[ADDRESS_85450] step of the data review again (identify and flag invalid responses). 
Although this has already been done at the item -level, this additional check allows a better understanding of variable construction.  
 
24   
a. Identify  and flag unreliable  cases:  The final step in the data screening  process  is 
to identify and flag entire cases (i.e., entire questionnaires) that are unreliable. By 
[CONTACT_78338], we mean that we have sufficient reason to believe that the  
respondent’s answers are not honest representations of their behaviors, 
knowledge,  and beliefs.  Cases  are flagged  as unreliable  if the participant  indicates 
they have not been honest in responding to the questionnaire or if project staff 
indicate in project logs specific issues encountered during data collection that are 
cause for treating a case as unreliable. Honesty during questionnaire 
administra tion is assessed from the following item on the Participant 
Questionnaire . 
 
• Have  you been  as honest  as possible  in responding  to all of the questions 
in this questionnaire?  
 
Persons who indicate No, none of the time are flagged as unreliable. In addition, 
cases may be flagged as unreliable if project log notes indicate a notable issue 
during data collection (e.g., participant determined to be fraudulent). Each 
suspected  unreliable  case is reviewed  by [CONTACT_78339] a senior  analyst  for a 
final determination of reliability. Data for cases that are deemed unreliable are 
included in the  benchmark analyses. However, sensitivity analyses that exclude 
the unreliable data will be conducted and results will be reported in an appendix 
of the report.  
 
b. Adjustment of baseline data: In the final step of the data cleaning process, we 
determine if any individuals who are in the randomized sample (for each 
outcome) are missing baseline covariates or the baseline measure of the outcome 
variable. If this is the case, our proposed benchmark  approach is to use dummy 
variable adjustment procedures, i.e., we code missing data to either zero or the 
mean of non -missing observations (for dichotomous and count/continuous 
variables,  respectively).  We construct  dummy  indicators  to identify  missing  cases 
imputed to the constant/mean value and we adjust estimates by [CONTACT_78340].  
 
iv. Missing data approach: Assuming that our study design and procedures are sound, 
missing  data pose perhaps  the greatest  threat  to the internal  validity  of our RCT  study  and 
the ITT framework (Puma et al. 2009; Moher et al., 2010).[ADDRESS_85451] remain  
equal in expectation at the  point of  analysis. When the  analytic  sample  is diminished by 
[CONTACT_78341] -response, non -random differences (i.e., self -selecting) between the 
treatment and comparison groups may be introduced into the sample and estimates of 
program  impacts  may become  biased.  Although  there  is no consensus  on how to resolve

[ADDRESS_85452] been published in education (Puma et al., 2009).  
 
Our six -step decision process for addressing this problem, as detailed below, is informed 
by [CONTACT_78342]. These steps (which are incorporated into our data cleaning procedures) 
articulate how we will deal with missing outcome and baseline/covariate data (variables 
outlined  in the Model  specification  and covariates  section,  necessary  for the estimation  of 
impacts). The benchmark approach that we have selected aims to mitigate the 
introduction of bias into our impact estimates and maximize the use of availa ble data by 
[CONTACT_78343]/covariate data. To test the robustness of this approach, and to 
verify these findings, we will report comparative findings using sensitivity analyses that 
also employ an alternative method which includes no adjustment  (as outlined in step 6).  
 
a. Using data cleaning procedures outlined in the Data cleaning section, identify 
outlying,  unreliable,  and invalid  data in any analytic  (i.e., outcome,  baseline,  or 
covariate) variables. Recode invalid data as missing, and flag outlier and 
unreliable data for sensitivity analys es.21  
 
b. Report  prevalence  of unit and item missingness  (which  result  from  nonresponse 
and invalid data ) for both treatment and control samples.[ADDRESS_85453] 
missing  values  (due to nonresponse)  and logically  update  missing  values  where 
this is the case. We will not logically impute where the missing values are 
previously invalid.  
 
d. Determine if any individuals who are in the randomized sample (for each 
outcome)  do not have  outcome  data at the  follow -up time  point. If  this is the  case, 
our proposed benchmark approach is to use case  deletion, as we  feel it is the  most 
straightforward  and prudent  approach  for missing  follow -up data recommended  in 
Puma et al. (2009). These cases will be deleted from the analytic sample and 
attrition statistics will be reported.  
 
e. Determine if any individuals who are in the analytic sample (for each outcome) 
are missing  baseline  covariates  or the baseline  measure  of the outcome  variable.  If 
this is the case, our proposed benchmark approach is to use dummy variable 
adjustment procedures, as we feel it is the most straightforward and prudent 
approach  for missing  baseline/covariate  data recommended  in Puma  et al. (2009).  
 
f. Conduct sensitivity analyses by [CONTACT_78344] (i.e., use case -wise deletion for all cases with missing 
baseline  and outcome  data).  In an appendix,  we will report  our benchmark  results 
next to the sensitivity analysis results to verify findings.  
 
 
 
21 We will code missing responses with a unique missing code that identifies or flags these missing values according to the reas on they 
are missing (i.e., nonresponse, invalid, inconsistent). See the Data cleaning section for details on how missing data are coded.  
[ADDRESS_85454] impacts participants’ reported: 1) frequency of 
having vaginal sex without a condom (in past 30 days); 2) current use of effective non -barrier 
contraception; and 3) number of sexual partners (in past 3 months), at short -term follow -up 
(three months post -intervention period). Below, we describe the specific operationalization of 
these three outcome measures.  
 
Frequency  of having  vaginal  sex without  condoms  (in past 30 days)  
We operationalize condom  use as a risk outcome; that  is, we measure  the frequency  with which 
participants  engage  in the risk behavior  of having  vaginal  sex without  a condom,  rather  than the 
frequency with which they engage in the safe sex practice of using condoms. Constructing the 
variable in this way allows us to examine the self -reported sexual behaviors of the full analytic 
sample of participants, regardless as to whether or not they are recently sexually active.  
 
Specifically, the frequency of having vaginal sex without condoms is constructed as a count 
measure - the total number of times a respondent reports not using a condom during vaginal sex 
in the past 30 days.  As constructed,  the measure  of risk is cumulative.23 A score  of 0 indicates  no 
risk (i.e., the  individual has not engaged in vaginal sex without a  condom either  because  they are 
sexually active and always use condoms or they are not sexually active); higher values indicate 
more discrete instances of risk. Data used to assess the impact of the treatment (MARSSI) on 
condom use during vaginal sex are obtained from the follow ing item on the Participant 
Questionnaire, which is administered to both the treatment and control groups at baseline, short - 
term follow -up (three months post -interventio n period), and long -term follow -up (six months 
post-intervention period).  
 
• In the past [ADDRESS_85455]  you had vaginal  sex without using  a condom?  
 
Persons  who indicate  that they have  not had vaginal  sex in the past [ADDRESS_85456] on frequency of having vaginal sex without  condoms  if the frequency  (number  of times)  
of vaginal  sex without  condoms  reported  by [CONTACT_78345]-intervention period is smaller than the frequency reported by [CONTACT_78346].  
 
Current  use of effective  non-barrier  contraception  
Use of effective non -barrier contraception is constructed as a dichotomous variable – 
 
[ADDRESS_85457] vaginal sex without a condom as a count instead of proportionate measure because we believe it p rovides 
a clearer depi[INVESTIGATOR_78287]’s magnitude of risk. For  example, if we operationalized risk as a  proportionate  measure, an individual 
who reports having vaginal sex two times in the past [ADDRESS_85458] 30 days, with 25 instances when a condom wasn’t used (50% risk). Operationalizing 
risk as a cumulative measure allows us to take into account the frequency with which an individual is having sex. 
24 The Participant  Questionnaire  contains  sexual  behavior  questions  that use a 30-day recall  period.  Research  has consistently  found 
that memory  of behaviors/events  decreases  over time and accuracy  of recall  is negatively  associated  with length  of recall  period  
(Clarke et al. 2008; Schwarz and Oyserman 2001), especially for more frequent behaviors. Since participants must have reporte d 
engagement in recent vaginal sex and some  sexual risk to  be eligible, we assume for  this group sexual activity is more  common. As 
such, we use  items with  a 30-day recall  period  to construct our  measures of  sexual  behaviors as we believe  these  should  elicit more 
accurate responses than a potentially more traditional, but longer recall period (e.g., three -month).  
 
 
[ADDRESS_85459] of the 
treatment (MARSSI) on contraceptive use are obtained from the following i tem on the 
Participant Questionnaire , which is administered to both the treatment and control groups at 
baseline,  short -term follow -up (three  months  post-intervention  period),  and long-term follow -up 
(six months post -intervention period).  
 
• Please  indicate  which  method of  prescription  birth  control you  are currently  using.  
o Oral  contraceptives  (for example,  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) 
o The patch  (for example,  Ortho  Evra)  
o The shot/injection  (for example,  Depo -Provera)  
o The ring (for example,  NuvaRing)  
o The implant  (for example,  Implanon  or Nexplanon)  
o IUD (for example,  ParaGard,  Skyla,  Mirena,  Kyleena,  Liletta)  
o None  of the  above  
 
Persons  who indicate  that they are currently  using  any of the listed  methods  are considered  to be 
currently using effective non -barrier  contraception and are coded as 1. Persons who select None 
are considered to not be currently using effective non -barrier contraception and are coded as 0.  
 
MARSSI will be considered to have a positive impact on non -barrier contraceptive use if, as 
compared to participants who are assigned to the control group, a larger proportion of 
participants who are offered MARSSI report using effective non -barrier contra ception at the 
three -month  post-intervention  period  and the difference  between  groups  is statically  significant.  
 
Number  of sexual partners  
Number of sexual partners is constructed as a count variable – the number of sexual partners the 
participant reports that they have had in the past three months.[ADDRESS_85460] 
of the treatment (MARSSI) on number of sexual partners are obtained from the following item 
on the Participan t Questionnaire,  which  is administered  to both the treatment  and control  groups 
at baseline, short -term follow -up (three months post -intervention period), and long -term follow - 
up (six months post -intervention period).  
 
• How  many  sexual partners  have  you had in  the past 3 months?  
 
Persons  who indicate  that they have  not had any sexual  partners  in the past three  months  are 
coded as having zero sexual partners.  
 
MARSSI  will be considered  to have  a positive  impact  on number  of sexual  partners  in the past 
three months if the number of sexual partners reported by [CONTACT_78347] -month post -intervention follow -up is smaller than the number of sexual partners 
reported by [CONTACT_78348].  
 
25 We elected to use a three -month  recall period for this outcome measure as it measures a behavior that is likely to occur with less 
frequency than individual acts of sex, and thus represents a quantity that would be easier to recall over  a longer period of time.

becoming pregnant?  
o Very important  
o Somewhat  important  
o A little important  
o Not important  
• If you found  out today  that you were  pregnant,  how would  you feel?  
o Very upset  
o A little upset  
o A little pleased  
o Very pleased  
Respondents are coded as being unambivalent (=0) about wanting to prevent a 
pregnancy  if they indicate  that it is Very important  for them  to avoid  pregnancy  and 
that they would be Very upset or A little upset by a pregnancy.  
 
Respondents  are coded  as being  unambivalent  (n=0)  about  wanting  a pregnancy 
if they indicated that it was N ot important for them to avoid pregnancy and that 
they would be V ery pleased or A little pleased about discovering a pregnancy.  
 
All other respondents are coded as ambivalent (n=1). This group includes 
respondents  who provide  inconsistent  or conflicting  responses  to the two items 
(e.g., V ery important to avoid pregnancy yet V ery pleased if a pregnancy 
occurred), those who give midscale responses for both  
items  (e.g.,  Somewhat  important  to avoid  pregnancy  and A little pleased  if a 
pregnancy were discovered).[ADDRESS_85477]-intervention (one

 c. Analytic  sample(s)  
The study sample is comprised of individuals who have met the study eligibility criteria (see 
Section 2. Impact Study Design for a detailed description of these criteria), chosen to enroll into 
the study, and been randomized into the treatment (MARSSI) or control condition (podcast 
group ). The act of randomization constitutes the offer to participate and is the point at which the 
individual becomes a participant in the study. The analytic sample for our primary research 
questions will be all participants wh o were randomized into either the treatment or control 
conditions and who have reported the necessary outcome data to construct the primary outcome 
measure of interest. We will impute missing baseline data for any participants in this group who 
are missing  either  baseline  covariate  data and/or  baseline  outcome  data.  Missing  data procedures 
are outlined in Data cleaning, subsection iv above.  
 
d. Assessment  of baseline  equivalence  
Baseline equivalence will be reported for all baseline measures of each outcome variable as well 
as relevant demographic and sexual behavioral measures.  We first list and describe  the measures 
we will use  to examine  the equivalence  of our treatment and control groups at baseline. After  we 
identify the measures, we provide details on the diagnostic methods that we will use to assess 
any baseline  differences  that may exist  between  the treatment  and control  groups  in the measures 
outlined below.  
 
Demographic  Measures  
Baseline equivalence will be assessed for four demographic variables. Age is constructed from 
data gathered by [CONTACT_78351] . Race, gender, and 
ethnicity  are constructed  using  participant  self-responses  to questions  in the baseline  Participant 
Questionnaire . For the race variables, categorical responses to a single question are used to 
create multiple dichotomous variables . We provide details on variable coding below; details on 
variable construction can be found in Table 4.

28 Age at screening  is calculated  using  the individual’s  reported  date of birth.  
29 At baseline, participants are asked “What is your gender?” and provided with a list of the following response options: Female; Male; Transgender female; 
Transgender male; Non -binary/genderqueer; Unsure/questioning; I do not identify as any of these (Would  you like to indicate  how you identify  yourself?) . 
A dummy  variable  is generated  using  the data reported  for this item,  where 1= participants who self -identified as female at baseline and 0= participants 
who self -identified as one of the other categories at baseline.  
30 At baseline, participants are asked “What is your race/ethnicity?” and are provided with a list of the following response opt ions: American 
Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian; Black or African American; Hispanic or Latino/a; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; White; or Some 
other race/ethnicity (please specify) . Participants can select more than one category and they can also specify  some  other  race/ethnicity.  
This item is used  to create  one dummy  variable  (White). For  this dummy  variable,  individuals  are coded as 1 if they self -identified only as 
“White” and 0 if otherwise.  
 
39  Baseline  Outcome  Measures  
In addition to the demographic variables, we will assess baseline equivalency of 
baseline measures  of the outcome  measures.  We provide  details  on variable  
coding  below;  details  on variable construction can be found in Table 2.  
 
• Frequency of having vaginal sex without condoms in the past 30 days at 
baseline (continuous;  values  range  0 to k, where  0= has had vaginal  sex 
without  condoms  [ADDRESS_85507] 30 days and k= number of times having 
vaginal sex without condoms in past 30 days)  
• Current  use of effective  non-barrier  contraception  at baseline  (dichotomous;  
values  of 0 or 1, where 0= not currently using effective non -barrier 
contraception and 1= currently using effective non -barrier contraception)  
• Number  of sexual  partners  in the past 3 months  at baseline  (continuous;  
values  range  0 to k, where 0= has [ADDRESS_85508] 3 months and k= 
number of sexual partners in past 3 months)  
 
Balance  Assessment  Methods  
We propose to assess baseline equivalence of the treatment and control groups 
according to a multi -step procedure.  Baseline  equivalence  statistics  will be 
produced  for each analytic  sample.31 Only participants who provide sufficient 
baseline and primary outcome data (i.e., non -missing) will be included in the test 
for baseline equivalence of the analytic sample for the specified outcome; thus, 
the analytic sample used for each research questio n may vary slightly because of 
the exclusion of non -responders.32 As required by [CONTACT_941] “Identifying Programs that 
Impact Teen Pregnancy, Sexually Transmitted Infections, and Associated Sexual 
Risk Behaviors” review protocol version 6.0, we will report the standardized 
mean difference of each baseline variable for the trea tment and control groups.[ADDRESS_85509] term by [CONTACT_941] s econd. The steps for establishing baseline equivalence using 
standardized mean difference are outlined below:

by [CONTACT_78352], subsection iv .

Infections,  and Associated Sexual Risk Behaviors: Review Protocol, Version 6.0.  
 
[ADDRESS_85511], we generate a model -based estimate of the difference 
between treatment and comparison groups on the baseline  measures 
identified above. Separate models will be run for each of the baseline 
variables. The empi[INVESTIGATOR_78292]  (using  Stata).  
If the measure  is dichotomous,  we propose  to use a linear  probability 
model to estimate the predicted probability of group membership. The 
model is a  reduced -form  variation  of the model  that we use to estimate  
program  impact  (as detailed in the Model specification and covariates 
section, below).34  
𝑌𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑇 +∑(𝛽𝑛𝐷𝑛)+ 𝜀 
where:  
𝑌𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒  – is the baseline measure of the variable that we use to establish 
baseline equivalency. This variable is included as a covariate in the 
benchmark analytic model (see Table 4 for details on variable coding). 
Separate models will be estimated for each base line measure specified 
above.  
𝛽0 – The intercept term, which represents the adjusted mean value of the 
baseline equivalency measure for participants in the control sample, with 
all other variables in the model held constant at zero.  
𝛽1 – This represents the adjusted (but not standardized) mean difference 
in the baseline equivalency variable between treatment and control 
participants.  
T - A dummy treatment indicator variable whose value equals 1 if the 
participant is randomized into the treatment group and zero otherwise.  
D – An n -1 vector of blocking  variables (i.e., subgroups within which 
random assignment occurred) , where n represents the full enumeration of 
all state by [CONTACT_78353] s were  randomly 
assigned to a condition.  For each of these n coordinator -by-state blocks , 
we include in the baseline equivalence  model a dummy  indicator  variable  
that will identify  whether a  study participant was randomized within that 
block  (1) or not (0).  
𝜀− The residual or random variation that remains for each observation 
after the structural components of the model are estimated. It is the 
difference between the observed and the predicted values at the 
individual level.  
 
step 2. Report  the adjusted  means  of the differences  in the baseline  
variable  of interest for the treatment and control groups.  
 
step 3 (continuous  variables  only).  If the baseline  measure  is continuous,  
we propose  to use  the following  formula  to calculate  the pooled  within -
group  standard  deviation  of the outcome measure:  
 
34 It is a reduced -form because  individual -level,  demographic  covariates are  omitted.  It is a  variation  because  the 
dependent  variable is the baseline equivalence variable, not the outcome measure.  
 
41  𝑆𝑝=√(𝑛𝑡−1)𝑆𝑡2+(𝑛𝑐−1)𝑆𝑐2
(𝑛𝑡+ 𝑛𝑐−2) 
 
where: n t and n c are the sample sizes, and S t and S c are the participant -
level standard deviations for the baseline measures for the analytic 
treatment and comparison groups, respectively.  We will produce  separate  
calculations  of the pooled  standardized  deviation for each variable used to 
establish baseline equivalence (as noted above).  
 
step 4. Produce  the standardized  difference  of means.  If the pre-intervention  
measure  is continuous, we will use the formula for Hedges’ g to compute the 
standardized difference of means for the treatment and comparison  groups : 
 
𝑔= 𝛽1
𝑆𝑝 
where:  𝛽1 is the adjusted mean difference in the variable selected to 
establish baseline equivalence  for the treatment  and comparison  groups  
(calculated  in Step 1), and Sp is the pooled standard deviation (produced in 
Step 3).  
 
For dichotomous baseline variables we will use the Cox index, which yields effect size 
values  similar  to the values  of Hedges’  g that one would  obtain  if group  means,  standard 
deviations, and sample sizes were available, assuming the dichotomous outcome 
measure is based on any underlying normal distribution. Following this guidance, we 
propose to use the Cox index to estimate baseline equivalence for dichotomous baselin e 
covariates. The formula is as follows:  
 
𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑥= [𝑙𝑛(𝑝𝑡
1−𝑝𝑡)−𝑙𝑛(𝑝𝑐
1−𝑝𝑐)]
1.65⁄ 
 
where: 𝑝𝑡 and 𝑝𝑐 represent the probability of occurrence of the event (or 
characteristic) within the treatment and comparison groups, respectively.  
 
e. Benchmark  analytic  approach  for primary  research  questions  
As detailed in our primary research questions, this study investigates whether offering 
MARSSI to participants impacts their reported frequency of having vaginal sex without 
condoms, use of effective non -barrier contraception, and number of sexual partners. We 
do this within the intent to treat (ITT) framework, w hich does not measure the effect of 
the participant’s exposure to the treatment itself but rather the effect of the offer of the 
treatment relative to the offer of receiving the control condition. This framework 
maintains the integrity of the experimental structure by [CONTACT_78354] (except those  who attrite)  in the  analytic  sample, thereby  [CONTACT_78355].  Bias can be 
insinuated, however, through self -selection if any participant who is randomized fails to 
provide outcome data.  
42   
i. Estimation  approach  
The primary research questions under investigation in this study are whether 
offering MARSSI  to participants impacts their: 1) reported frequency of having 
vaginal sex without condoms , 2) use of effective non -barrier contraception, and 3) 
reported number of sexual partners (see Table 2 for  variable constructions ).  
We propose to estimate these impacts using a regression -based approach that will 
model intervention  effects as a function of assignment to MARSSI  (i.e., treatment), 
relevant baseline covariates, a baseline measure of the outcome variable, and the 
combined  state and coordinator -level ( dummy blocking) indicators (see Table 4 for  
variable constructions) .[ADDRESS_85512] of the treatment, 
we propose a model -based approach because it will increase the precision of those 
estimates and purge any small differences associated with baseline imbalance. The 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_78293] (using Stata).  We 
present the empi[INVESTIGATOR_78294]:  
 
𝑌𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑇 + 𝛽2 𝑌𝑃𝑟𝑒+ ∑(𝛽𝑃𝑋𝑃) + ∑(𝛽𝑛𝐷𝑛)+∑(𝛽𝑝𝑀𝑝)+ 𝜀 
 
where:  
𝑌𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 - The outcome of interest, either: 1) times  having vaginal sex without 
condoms in the past 30 days (continuous; values range 0 to k, where 0= has had 
sex without condoms [ADDRESS_85513] 30 days, and k= number of times having 
vaginal sex without condoms in past 30 days); 2) number of sexual partners in 
the past 3 months (continuous; values range 0 to k, where 0= has [ADDRESS_85514] 3 months, and k= number of sexual partners in past 3 months) ; 
or 3) current use of effective non -barrier contraception (dichotomous; where 1= 
currently using eff ective non -barrier contraception and 0= not currently using 
effective non -barrier contraception)  reported by [CONTACT_3445] i three months post -
intervention  (see Table 2 for full details on the variable construction).  
𝛽0 – The intercept term, which represents, depending on the outcome measure 
of interest in the analysis, the outcome for the average control participant with 
all other variables in the model held constant at zero.  
𝛽1 – This is the parameter estimate of substantive interest. 𝛽1 represents, 
depending on the outcome measure of interest in the analysis, either: 1) the 
 
[ADDRESS_85515] hypothesis testing 
statistics (t -test). With that said, we propose a regression -based model that includes covariates, because randomization should ensure 
covariates are uncorrelated with the treatment variab le (i.e., they should not affect the estimate of the treatment effect), and the inclusion of 
covariates may improve the precision/efficiency of the estimate of the treatment effect. See: Angrist, J. D., & Pi[INVESTIGATOR_78295], J. ( 2009). Mostly

between  the proportion of  treatment participants who self -report using effective 
non-barrier contraception and control participants who self -report using 
effective non -barrier contraception  three months post -intervention .  
𝑇 –A dummy treatment indicator variable whose value equals 1 if the participant 
is randomized into the treatment group and 0 otherwise.  
𝑌𝑃𝑟𝑒– The baseline measure of the outcome variable of interest reported by 
[CONTACT_3445] i at baseline (see Table 2 for full details on the variable 
construction); variable will be re -centered at the grand mean for analysis.  
𝑋 – A p vector of baseline (i.e., measured prior to receiving intervention or 
exogenous to treatment) participant -level covariates to account for the variation 
in outcomes associated with these groups. These covariates, listed in detail in 
Table 4, will include:  
a) Age – self-reported age (based on date of birth) at screening (continuous; 
range 16 -21); variable will be re -centered at the grand mean for analysis.  
b) Gender – gender of participants as self -reported at baseline (coded as 1 if 
female and coded as 0  if otherwise); variable will be re -centered at the 
grand mean for analysis.  
c) Race – race of participant as self -reported at baseline (coded as 1 if 
participant self -identified as only White and 0 if otherwise); variable will 
be re -centered at the grand mean for analysis.  
d) Ethnicity – Hispanic/Latino(a) ethnicity of participant as self -reported at 
baseline (coded as 1 if identify as Hispanic/Latino(a) and 0 if do not 
identify as Hispanic/Latino(a)) ; variable will be re -centered at the grand 
mean for analysis.  
D – An n -1 vector of blocking  variables (i.e., subgroups within which random 
assignment occurred), where n represents the full enumeration of all state -by-
coordinator blocks from which participants were randomly assigned to 
condition.  For each of these n coordinator -by-state blocks, we include in the 
analytic  model a dummy  indicator variable that will identify whether a study 
participant was randomized within that block (1) or not (0).  The v ariable s will be 
re-centered at the grand mean for analysis.  
𝑀 – A p vector of missing baseline data indicator variables representing each  of 
the p  baseline covariate s that had missing observations (coded as 1 if the 
observation for that variable is missing and 0 if it is non -missing).  
 
Using a vector of dummy variables  (LSDV)  in a regression to account for a blocked 
randomization scheme is a conventional choice for a situation where each block has 
the same probability of assignment.[ADDRESS_85518] 
(1998) and others have pointed out, however, scenarios exist where the strategy may 
fail to identify the estimand of interest for a variety of reasons. Of particular interest 
 
36 Gerber, A. S., & Green, D. P. (2012). Field Experiments: Design, Analysis and Interpretation. W.W. Norton & & Company.  
44  here is that the dummy -blocking scheme may exclude blocks/cases from  the full 
randomized sample. Regardless of what the nominal randomization probabilities 
may be, one feature of the blocking model is that  it will assign zero weight to any 
block partition where the actualized probability of treatment equals 0 or 1 . That is, 
study assignment blocks that contain only a single participant (who is then assigned 
to either treatment or control) are functionally excluded from the treatment effect 
estimate.  
 
If this is pervasive enough in the analytic sample – where multiple cells exist with 
just a single participant – impact estimates may fail to  identify  the treatment effect 
for the fullest possible ITT sample . In this case we will alter our benchmark 
approach and substitute the LSDV procedure  with an almost -equivalent inverse -
probability -of-treatment -weighted (IPTW) regression , which should mitigate th e 
exclusion problem , while still weighting cells accordingly . This estimation approach 
is almost equivalent to the LSDV blocking procedure  except that it is functionally 
saturated with respect to the treatment and dummy variables (but not covariates) , 
and it can be constructed to broaden the analytic sample to include cells where only 
a single case was randomized and (calculated) probability of treatment i s 0 or 1 .37 
When we use a normalized  IPTW and  estimate the propensity score with the linear 
probability model he single -case blocks are given reduced but not zero weight.  
 
If we use the IPTW regression as the benchmark approach, we will weight each 
observation by [CONTACT_78356]. For the treatment group, the weights will be  1
𝑒(𝑥); for the control group, 
weights will be 1
1−𝑒(𝑥). Where e(x) is the propensity score estimated by [CONTACT_78357]:  
 
𝑒(𝑥)= 𝛼0+∑(𝛽𝑛𝐷𝑛)+ 𝜀 
 
 
Prior to estimation we will  normalize weights  such that the sum of all weights will  
be equal to 1.  
 
We will report model -estimated effects and the results of significance tests in the 
findings section of the final impact report. Statistical significance will be based on 
test statistics produced by [CONTACT_78358] 𝛽1 using a two -tailed test, with p 
< .05.  
 
ii. Adjustment  for baseline  differences  
 
As described in the Estimation approach subsection above, we will include 
covariates for  the identified  demographic  characteristics  and a baseline  measure  of 
the outcome  of interest in each our benchmark models to increase the precision of 
our estimates and account for any small baseline differences between the treatment

using  a condom?  
 
The resulting  variable  is continuous  with values  that range  from [ADDRESS_85521] 
30 days, and k indicates the number of times the person has engaged in vaginal sex 
without a condom (risk behavior)  in the past 30 days.  
 
Note: All respondents who have baseline data and have provided a response to 
either this question or have indicated they have not had vaginal sex in the past [ADDRESS_85522] 30 days are coded as having vaginal sex without a condom 
zero times.  
Current  use of 
effective non - 
barrier 
contraception  The protective  outcome  is operationalized  as a dichotomous  variable  indicating  
whether  a person reports currently using effective non-barrier contraception or not.

o IUD (for example,  ParaGard,  Skyla,  Mirena,  Kyleena,  Liletta)  
o None of  the above  
 
A person  who selects  Oral contraceptives,  patch,  shot/injection,  ring, implant,  or IUD 
is given  a value of 1 for the measure. A person who selects None is given a value of 
0 for the measure.  
 
The resulting  variable  is dichotomous  with values  0 or 1, where  0 indicates  a person  
who does not currently use effective non -barrier contraception and 1 indicates a 
person who does currently use effective non -barrier contraception.

Blocking  covariates  
Study coordinator  
by [CONTACT_78360]  A set of n -1 dummy variables, where n refers to the full set of  study  coordinator  
by [CONTACT_78361] s are randomly assigned to  the treatment or 
control condition. Participants are enrolled within one of 255 possible blocks 
defined by (1) the research coordinator who enrolled  the participant  into the study  
and (2) the state (or District of Columbia) where the participant indicated they 
would be most likely to seek reproductive health care.  To clarify, each of the 5 
research coordinators assign participants within one of their own 51 separate 
(state -and DC -based) random allocation lists, for a total potential 255 random 
allocation blocks.  
 
Data  for the measure  are obtained  from the Enrollment  Log database

f. Analytic  approach  for secondary  research  questions  
For the secondary  research  questions  listed  under  the subsection  Analysis  of secondary  
outcomes in full sample using ITT approach in the Impact Study Research Questions 
section, we will use the same analytic approach as described above under the 
Benchmark analytic approach for primary research questions subsection. For the 
secondary research questions listed under the subsection Analysis of primary and 
secondary outcomes in subgroups using ITT approach , models will also include a 
measure for the subgroup of interest and an interaction term for the subgroup and 
treatment to assess differences in subgroup impacts. For the secondary research 
questions listed under the subsect ion CACE analysis of primary and secondary 
outcomes , we will use CACE analysis. For this, we will assess the effect of MARSSI 
when individuals participate in (comply with) the program using two analytic methods 
derived from the principal stratification framework that estimate impact conditioned on 
endogeno us (post -randomization) compliance: principal score weighting and two -stage 
least squares regression.[ADDRESS_85526] method  we will use to estimate  the CACE  is a balancing  procedure,  
based  on propensity score methods, which can be used in settings where 
principal stratum membership (compliance) is observable under one treatment 
condition. The use of propensity  scores  is a common  technique  to balance  
treatment  and comparison  groups  in nonexperimental  studies;  however,  
 
38 Frangakis,  C. E., & Rubin,  D. B. (2002).  Principal  stratification  in causal  inference.  Biometrics,  58(1),  21–29. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.[ADDRESS_85527]  also been  used to address noncompliance in 
RCTs as well.39  
 
Within the context of a randomized trial using a 1:[ADDRESS_85528] complied if the program had 
been offered to them. Whereas the conventional use of propensity scores aims 
to model treatment group membership (where  treatment  group membership  is 
the same  as intervention  receipt),  the aim here is to use propensity  scores  to 
model  treatment  receipt  (compliance)  in the treatment  group and subsequently 
predict probability of principal stratum membership among members of the 
control group.  
 
In accordance with Hill et al. (2002), to distinguish this latter prediction step 
for the control group, we refer to their probability of principal stratum 
membership as the principal score.40 The core assumption in propensity score 
methods is that of  conditional ignorable treatment assignment, or the assertion 
that treatment assignment  is independent of the potential outcomes, given a 
set of observed covariates (Rosenbaum  & Rubin,  1983).  When  we use a 
probability  score  to balance  treatment  and control groups to estimate CACE in 
an RCT, this assumption now applies to principal stratum membership 
(compliance). In other words, principal stratum membership is independent  of 
the potential  outcomes  given  the observed  set of covariates  (Jo & Stuart, 2009).  
 
We will follow the steps outlined in Stuart & Jo (2015) to estimate the CACE 
using principal score weights. Briefly, these will include: 1) using the same 
baseline covariates used in the benchmark analysis to predict compliance 
among the treatment group; 2 ) predicting the  probability of  compliance 
(principal score)  among members of the  control  group;  3) creating  analytic  
weights  reflecting  the probability  of compliance; and 4) estimating CACE by 
[CONTACT_78362].  Consistent  with 
the ITT analysis,  we will use an appropriate  regression  model (OLS for 
continuous/scale measures, logit for dichotomous, count for frequency) for 
each outcome. We will include the following covariates in each model: age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, randomization blocks, and the baseline measure of the 
outcome.

estimates  participation, given  treatment  assignment  and subsequently  
estimates  the outcome, given participation; this is known as Two -Stage Least 
Squares (TSLS) regression.41 Instrumental variable analysis is a common 
technique in evaluation to estimate the CACE in randomized trials.42  
 
We will estimate the CACE with the ivregress 2sls command in Stata 16.1 
(StataCorp, 2019).The  first stage  model  predicts  compliance  (full participation)  
using  the instrument (treatment assignment). The second stage predicts the 
outcome, given participation.  
 
This simultaneous  estimation  framework  allows  the user to calculate  accurate  
standard errors that account for the uncertainty in the first stage model (Stuart 
et al.,2008).  
 
The benefit of the TSLS model is that it allows for the inclusion of baseline 
covariates that predict both participation and the outcome, which can help 
further reduce the amount of error in the estimation and possibly reduce bias 
due to exclusion restrict ion violations.43 As with the benchmark  approach  and 
principal  score  method  approach,  we will include the following covariates in 
both stages: age, gender, race, ethnicity, a baseline measure of the outcome of 
interest, and a series of dummy variables representing the randomization 
blocks.  
 
g. Sensitivity  analyses  
We will conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness and validity of our 
benchmark approaches outlined above. These include: 1) estimating program effects 
using OLS regression without  baseline covariates  and blocking variables ; 2) 
implementing  alternative  models  to test for bias; 3) excluding  baseline  covariates; 4) not 
imputing or adjusting for missing data; 5) excluding unreliable data; 6) excluding 
outliers; 7) condensing data collection windows to exclude late responders; and 8) using 
alternative model specifications to estimate program effects.

p.10). We will report any substantive differences in the results section of the final 
manuscript and analytic  findings  for both approaches  will be presented  alongside  
each other  in an appendix .  
 
iii. Without baseline covariates. Our benchmark approach is to include baseline 
covariates in our model to improve the precision of our estimates. To test this, we 
will conduct sensitivity analyses  that involve  running  identical  empi[INVESTIGATOR_78298].  We will report any substantive differences 
in the results section of the final manuscript and analytic findings for both 
approaches will be presented alongside each other in an appendix.  
 
iv. Without adjusted baseline data. As outlined in the Missing data approach section, 
our benchmark approach is to adjust baseline data as published guidance suggests 
that this may produce unbiased impact estimates and maximize the use of available 
data. We will test this by [CONTACT_78364] l 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_78299]. As outlined in the Assessment of 
baseline equivalence section, we will also produce diagnostic estimates of baseline 
equivalency on the b aseline outcome variables according  to our benchmark  
approach.  We will report  any substantive  differences  identified  in these analyses in 
the results section of the final manuscript and analytic findings for both approaches 
will be presented alongside each other in an appendix.  
 
v. With out unreliable data. As discussed in the Data cleaning section, data for cases 
that are deemed unreliable are flagged, but still included in  benchmark analyses. We 
will also conduct  sensitivity  analyses  that involve  running  identical  empi[INVESTIGATOR_78300] . We will report any substantive differences in the

be presented alongside each other in an appendix.  
 
vi. Without outliers . As discussed in the Data cleaning section, extreme data values are 
investigated and flagged as outliers. Our benchmark analytic approach is to include 
data flagged  as outliers  (i.e., extreme  values  that are not considered  invalid)  in 
analysis.  We will also conduct sensitivity analyses that exclude these data. We will 
report any substantive differences in the results section of the final manuscript and 
analytic findings for both approaches will be presented alongside each other in an 
append ix. 
 
vii. Condensed data collection windows . Our benchmark approach is to include follow -
up data from  all participants  who completed  a questionnaire  during  their open  data 
collection  window, regardless of the time point in that window when it was 
completed. Data collection windows are broad to minimize attrition from the analytic 
sample. To examine whether or not this influences our results – and, in particular, 
whether or not study pa rticipants who respond later report different outcomes from 
those who respond earlier – we will conduct an analysis that examines the difference, 
if any, in response time between treatment and control participants and compares 
impact estimates for analytic  samples without late responders. Late responders will 
be defined as those participants who complete their long -term questionnaire more 
than one month after the initiation of the three -month data collection window. We 
will report any substantive differences in the results section of the final manuscript 
and analytic findings for both approaches will be presented alongside each other in 
an appendix.  
viii. Statistical modeling. We have proposed  using OLS regression as the benchmark 
statistical method for producing impact estimates . We will conduct analyses to test 
robustness of this choice and to  assess whether there are substantive differences in 
the point estimates of interest produced by [CONTACT_78365].45 
Specifically, f or each research question, we will compare OLS estimates with those 
derived from models that may fit the distribution of the data better . For the two count 
outcomes (frequency of having vaginal sex without condoms and number of sexual 
partners), t he treatment effect will be estimated with an appropriate count model 
(using Stata); for the dichotomous outcome, the effect will be estimated using a logit 
model.[ADDRESS_85533] estimates with a 
Bayesian  interpretation based on posterior probabilities of program effectiveness. To do 
 
45 To account for potential violations of model assumptions (e.g., heteroskedasticity, overdispersion), we will use robust stand ard 
errors in all analyses.   
46 For count models, we will assess model fit using diagnostic model -fit methods, including the Stata command countfit, AIC and BIC 
model fit statistics, and by [CONTACT_78366]. See Hilbe, J. M. ( 2014).

53  this, we will rely upon the BAyesSian Interpretation of Estimates (BASIE) framework.47 
The prior distributions for our Bayesian estimate will be informed by [CONTACT_78367] -analysis 
of teen pregnancy prevention intervention  program  effects  conducted  by [CONTACT_78368].48 
We will calculate  the precision -weighted average  of the traditional  estimate  (i.e., 
shrunken  estimate)  based  on this prior  evidence  using  the BASIE probability tool 
provided by [CONTACT_78369]. The shrunken estimates will be treated as sensitivity analyses to 
our traditional estimates. We will report the shrunken estimates alongside the  estimates  
derived  from  our impact  study  data and interpret  them  using  posterior  probabilities.

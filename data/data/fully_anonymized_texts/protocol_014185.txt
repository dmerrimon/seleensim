Post-surgery pain management is critical for ensuring timely patient recovery and minimizing complications. Part of the multimodal approach to managing severe acute pain in the days following surgeries is the use of nerve blocks. The relatively short-lived effect of commonly used local anesthetics recently prompted the development and subsequent approval of a liposomal formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel; Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, New Jersey). It has demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], with a slower release into blood stream of up to 96 hours after administration, following a single dose wound infiltration at the end of various surgeries (summarized in (1)). Studies using other modes of administration reported similar results (2, 3).  Thoracic surgeries pose an exceptional challenge as they are one of the most painful surgeries and poor pain-management contributes to reduced quality of life and severely delayed recovery (4, 5). The anesthesiology protocol within the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program at medical centers across the world aim to increase patient comfort after surgery while reducing complications and use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. As a common part of this protocol, intercostal nerve blocks with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195611]-thoracotomy pain and studies show that it may be just as or more effective than bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195612], decreasing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_195613] (6-8).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_195614], the pharmacokinetics of a single dose injection of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195615]. The aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195616]-thoracotomy pain management. Further, the information gleaned from this study will allow for the optimal use of additional local anesthetics, particularly those administered intravenously, for the purpose of obtaining maximal pain relief while minimizing the occurrence of local anesthetic toxicity.

If this study involves qualitative research clearly state your research hypothesis or question.   This section should not include information already included in other sections such as background information or information from the procedures section.   The intent of this prospective study is to evaluate the serum concentrations of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195617] a surgeon administered, single dose injection at the intercostal nerves, at the start of thoracotomies. The primary end points will be to assess the time to peak serum concentration/s of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Tmax) and peak serum concentration/s (Cmax) after a single-dose injection in the intercostal nerves. We will also determine pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) and time apparent terminal elimination half-life (T1/2). In doing so, we will obtain serum bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195618]. Additionally, we will monitor pain levels in the patients through the 96-hour period after intercostal nerve block injection.

The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the time to peak serum concentration/s of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Tmax) as well as maximal serum concentration/s (Cmax). Additional end-points will include the assessment of area under serum concentration-time curve (AUC) and observed terminal elimination half-life of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (T1/2). These parameters will allow us to generate a pharmacokinetic profile of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195620]. This study will only have one group and a sample size of [ADDRESS_232135] complete pharmacokinetic data and to minimize blood draws.   3.  Provide a justification for the sample size used in this protocol.   Include the anticipated accrual rate, the accrual goal for the study, including accrual goals by [CONTACT_195631], adjustments for drop-outs etc. and study duration. Answer/Response:  The data to aid in the determination of sample size calculation are inadequate. However, published studies investigating the pharmacokinetics of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195621] a small number of patients. The most relevant and similar to our study is the data published by [CONTACT_195632]. As such, our determination of sample size is based on this previous report. Viscusi et al. assessed the pharmacokinetics of 266mg liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195622] (3). Here, the total subject number was 7 and the confidence intervals for Tmax were very large: 8 – 48 hours with the median being 24 hours. We believe that a sample size of 15 subjects for our study would be sufficient to obtain better confidence intervals for our Tmax target. We anticipate that the drop-out rate will be 25% and as such, will aim to consent [ADDRESS_232136] for 3 months.

Answer/Response: N/A   Study Procedures-Biomedical Research  1.  What will be done in this protocol?    INSTRUCTIONS:  This should include everything that will be done as part of this protocol. Do not repeat information that is included in other sections such as Background or Hypothesis sections.  This section should include an indication of which research interventions if any offer a prospect for direct benefit and which interventions (invasive measurements, collection of blood, tissue, data, surveys, etc.) are being done solely to answer a research question 
Pharmacokinetics of Single-Dose Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195610]:  HSR Submission Number: [ZIP_CODE] Version Date: 11/14/17 Page Number: 9 of 10 and generate generalizable knowledge. If the interventions done solely for research purposes are associated with greater than minimal risk they need to be justified. Describe and justify any control and experimental arm and include method, dose, and duration of drug administration. Reference any claim of clinical equipoise if applicable.    If you are obtaining specimens or data, provide information regarding the type of specimen/data, amount of specimen needed and how the specimen/data will be obtained and what analysis will be done with the specimen/data.  Special note for studies with waiver of consent/waiver of documentation of consent:  Include a statement regarding how subjects will be recruited. For other studies this information is captured in Recruitment does not need to be duplicated in this section. In this study, patients who are undergoing thoracotomies will be consented separately from the surgery itself. Patients will be consented for the study on the day of the surgery in the Surgical Admission Suites (SAS), prior to being taken to the OR. The study participants will be given a standard (266 mg/20ml) single dose injection of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_195623]. Immediately prior to the injection of the local anesthetic, [ADDRESS_232137], a venipuncture will be performed.  Blood samples will be analyzed for the following pharmacokinetic parameters: area under the serum concentration-time infinity (AUC), maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax), time to attain Cmax (Tmax), and apparent terminal elimination half-life (T1/2). At the same time of blood samples, pain scores will be recorded on a standard ten-point pain scale. These pain scores will be omitted if the patient is under general anesthesia.    2. If this protocol involves study treatment, explain how a subject will be transitioned from study treatment when they have completed their participation in the study.   Example:  If the subject will be taking an investigational drug, will they need to be put back on an approved drug when they have completed the study?  If yes, explain how this will be accomplished and who will cover the cost.  If the subject has a device implanted will it be removed?  Again- who will cover the cost of the removal?   Instructions: Answer NA if this study does not involve a study treatment.   Answer/Response:  N/A

(e.g. study team will administer study drug/ study interventions, study drug inventory of dispensed and returned drug, diary etc.) The blood draws will first be done by [CONTACT_195633]-surgery care team. A member of the study team will be present at all blood draws.  2.  Describe criteria for when a subject is considered to be non-compliant with study procedures.   (e.g. subject returns more than 20% of the study drug, subject misses 20% of study visits) Answer/Response: Subject declines to complete all of the blood draws.

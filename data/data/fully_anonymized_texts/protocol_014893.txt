1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  Connect -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of 
Patients and Caregivers during Transitions from Skilled 
Nursing Facilities to Home  
Study Description:  The proposed study will test the efficacy of Connect -Home, a 
transitional care intervention, targeting seriously ill Skilled 
Nursing Facility (SNF) patients who discharge to home and 
their primary caregivers. The study will be set in six North 
Carolina SNFs and in the patient’s home (during intervention 
periods only).  Using a stepped -wedge cluster -randomized 
trial design, six SNFs will be randomly allocated to st andard 
discharge planning (control period) vs. the Connect -Home 
intervention (intervention period) over six sequential time -
periods.   
  
Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_624102]. After informed consent, 
baseline enrollment surveys will be collected for patients and 
caregivers.  Additionally, a medical record review for data 
related to continued health outcomes will be conducted for 
patients. Telephone questionnaires will be used to survey 
patients and care givers at 7, 30, and 60 days after patients 
return home.    
Objectives:  Primary Objective:    
1.1: To assess patient preparedness for discharge seven days 
after discharge from a skilled nursing facility.  
 
1.2: To assess caretaker preparedness for the careg iving role 
seven days after discharge from a skilled nursing facility.   
  
Secondary Objectives:

Description of Study 
Intervention: Connect -Home is a two -step  transitional care intervention: 1) 
SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan or Care and 
prepare the patient and caregiver to manage the patient's 
illness at home; and 2) within [ADDRESS_830919] -Home Activation RN visits the p atient's home and 
helps the patient and caregiver implement the written 
Transition Plan of Care.  Both intervention steps focus on 6 
key care needs to optimize patient and caregiver outcomes: 
1) home safety and level of assistance; 2) advance care 
planning; 3) symptom management; 4) medication 
reconciliation; 5) function and activity; and 6) coordination of 
follow -up medical care.  
Study Duration:  This study will be ongoing for four years.  
Participant Duration:  Participants will be recruited during  the SNF stay, when

2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are medically complex with incurable chronic conditions, 
dependence on caregivers for activities of daily living, and have a recent acute illness, such as septicemia 
and hip and femur procedures.1-3  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_624070] (>50% in 90 days),3 SNF patients and their caregivers do not receive transitional 
care that prepares them to manage the patient’s serious illnesses at home.   No efficacy studies of 
transitional care have targeted this population, or measured whether interventions resulted in improved 
patient and caregiver outcomes.[ADDRESS_830941] -Home will generate a new model of transitional care not dependent on research staff for 
delivery, thereby [CONTACT_624104].  
  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
Annually, 1.7 -1.8 million older adults undergo epi[INVESTIGATOR_624071] 
a “short stay” in a nursing home, where they use the Medicare SNF benefit for rehabilitation, medical 
and nursing care.  1-3 SNF patients are seriously ill: 56 -62% are ≥80 years old; 100% have recent acute 
illness (e.g., hip fracture, heart failure, genitourinary and pulmonary infections with & without sepsis); 
28-34% are treated in intensive care during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408];  and 29 -43% have ≥[ADDRESS_830942] underlying 
incurable chronic conditions:   29-35% are cognitively impaired;  46% have Charlson Comorbidity scores 
≥2, 28% have scores ≥3;  and nearly all experience multi- morbidity,  for example, 82% of those with heart 
failure have 5 co -occurring chronic conditions.2,8-10 SNF patients also are functionally impaired and frail 
with an average of three or more geriatric syndromes (e.g., depressive symptoms, poor sleep, 
unplanned weight loss) and depend on caregivers for 3 -6 activities of daily living.6,8,11,12 Complicating 
these challenges, 25% of SNF patients live alone and 20 -25% are co -insured with Medicaid.  After 
returning home, former SNF patients are at high risk for falls  and functional impairment; in a recent 
study, 61% showed little or no functional improvement one year after SNF discharge.13-15 
  
SNF patients are also at an exceptionally high risk for return to acute care, continued functional decline, 
and death.  In a preliminary analysis of 55,000 SNF patient transitions to home, >5 0% of patients 
returned to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79638] 90 days of discharge or died: 25.9% used ED services, 20.1% were re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], and 8.1% died within 90 days of returning home.3 Moreover, lacking advance directives and 
goals of care, 33% of discharged SNF patients who died within the next month, died in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624072] -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_830943] -Home Protocol v 2.0 13Jul2020  11 than at home.16 Thus, SNF patients are a seriously ill and functionally impaired population, supported by 
[CONTACT_624105].  
  
These seriously ill patients, as they draw closer to the end-of-life, also experience multiple transitions 
between healthcare providers and settings.17-19 Much evidence demonstrates that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based 
transitional care improves patients’ preparedness for discharge and decreases the rate of re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 30 days of discharge.20-22 However, in a systematic review of SNF -based 
transitional care,  no randomized clinical trials were identified and only a limited set of observational 
studies of transitional care were found.4 In the set of observational stud ies, there were substantial 
limitations, including intervention designs lacking caregiver support, advance care planning, and home 
follow -up after SNF discharge and serious methodological flaws (non -experimental designs with small 
samples and no reliable m easurement of intermediate and 30 or 60 day patient - and care -giver 
outcomes).4  Lacking transitional care, SNF patients (and their caregivers) are not prepared to manage 
the patient's serious illness at home, and are at high risk for new acute medical eve nts, diminished 
quality of life and other poor health outcomes.23-[ADDRESS_830944] 
care needed for seriously ill patients to bridge the vulnerable period following SNF discharge.28-32 
  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIA L RISKS  
  
Physical Risks:  
  
Patients and caregivers in control periods will receive discharge planning in the SNF, and those in 
intervention periods will receive transitional care in the SNF and in the patient’s home.   Discharge 
planning and transitional care activities involve verbal assessments, conversation, education, and 
planning.   There is a possibility that participants could be fatigued from participation in the data 
collection activities.   For example, while participating in a care -planning meeting, a patient might feel 
fatigued or need to take a break.    
  
If any partic ipant has a physical injury, the study team will help them seek immediate medical attention. 
If a SNF patient or caregiver expresses fatigue during data collection, the data collection session will be 
terminated immediately, and a follow -up appointment sch eduled.  
Connect -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_830945] -Home Protocol v 2.0 13Jul2020  12   
  
Psychological Risks:  
  
Emotional distress related to learning more about medical and functional challenges and plans for care 
at home is a potential psychological risk. During the control and intervention periods, staff in the SNF 
and in the ho me health agency will engage patients and caregivers in conversations to plan strategies 
for managing the patient’s serious illness at home.   Also, during enrollment and data collection 
activities, staff will assess the patients’ quality of life, functional mobility, falls at home, days at home 
without acute care use and caregivers’ burden and distress related to the caregiving role. Staff will also 
review the patient’s advance directives.   These study -related activities may also involve a chance for 
emotio nal distress.  
  
The study team will refer distressed patients and caregivers to their attending or primary care physicians 
for support with emotional distress.   
  
Social Risks:  
  
During enrollment and data collection activities, study staff will collect data from participants about 
their health, function and quality of life; if others observed patients or caregivers participating in these 
activities, there is a chance that it could embarrass or distress patients or caregivers.   
  
In intervention and control periods, the study team  will recruit and collect baseline data for participants 
in a private room.   When necessary, this data may also be obtained virtually when research personnel 
are not able to encounter face to face interactions with study participants.  When these occasions arise, 
all virtual interactions will be conducted at a time when the patient is alone and not able to be 
overheard.  Study team will conduct these in private settings as well ensuring that no questions an d/or 
responses will be overheard.  During telephone calls to collect outcome data, the identity of patients will 
be confirmed.   All research staff will be trained by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_624073].   The research team members will remind participants that participation in the 
study is voluntary, and that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any tim e if they are not 
comfortable.   The team will assure patients and caregivers that withdrawal from the study will not have 
an impact on their medical care.   
  
Risk of Loss of Confidentiality:   
  
During enrollment and data collection activities, staff will o btain health information about patients and 
caregivers.   Thus, a potential risk to SNF patients and caregivers is loss of confidentiality.    
  
All research study personnel will be trained in IRB and HIPAA guidelines to maintain the security and 
confidentia lity of the data.   During the consenting process, the study team will explain the 
Connect -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_830946] confidentiality, 
including (a) using study codes on data documents and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a separate document that links the 
study code to subjects’ identifying information locked in a separate loca tion and restrict access to this 
document to certain members of the study team; (b) de- identification of data to remove the possibility 
that data could be connected to individuals that consented to participate in the study; (c) encrypting 
identifiable data ; and (d) securely storing data documents within locked locations.   All identifying 
information will be destroyed at the earliest possible time following completion of the study.   In 
addition, data will be reported in aggregate form, without identifying in formation by [CONTACT_624106].   Publications arising from the study will not contain personal information.   All SNF patients or 
caregiver participants will continue to receive routine medical care from their health care providers 
throughout the study.   
  
  
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIA L BENEFITS  
  
The major potential benefit of this study is new knowledge about ways to improve outcomes for 
seriously ill SNF patients and/or their caregivers. The intervention patients will receive valuable 
information, training and plans about their diagnosis, indicators of emerging medical problems, 
medications, treatments, advance care directives, follow- up appointments and studies, home care 
services, questions to ask their community physicians, strategies to avoid falls at home, self -care at 
home in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic  (when applicable) , and discrepancies in their home 
medications that should be addressed with community or SNF physicians.   Their family caregivers will 
also receive this information and training as well as training to support the patient and strategies to 
relieve stress and hardship related to the caregiver role.   Participants in the control periods in the SNFs 
will receive usual discharge planning.   
  
As a result of the research, we will know whether and to what degree the intervention, compared to 
usual care, increased the capacity of SNF patients to achieve health care goals at home after SNF 
discharge and caregivers to avoid burden and distress related to the caregiving role.   If the intervention 
is successful, this study will provide an evidence -based practice rationale for intervention with seriously 
ill SNF patients or their caregivers.  It will also provide new knowledge related to care of adults with 
serious illness in the context of the COVID -[ADDRESS_830947] -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions

Connect -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_830959] -Home is a stepped -wedge cluster randomized trial (SW -CRT) to test the Connect- Home 
intervention against standard discharge planning (control), using both patients discharged to home 
(N=360) and their caregivers (N=360) in 6 SNFs.44  In this design, SNFs will be randomly allocated to one 
of six sequences of time -periods defined by [CONTACT_624108] a SNF begins the control condition and, 
after a two -month staff training period, the time -period (or "step") that begins the Connect -Home 
protocol condition (Figure 2). [ADDRESS_830960] care in a uni- directional crossover design at the cluster (SNF) level; a patient 
and their caregiver receives either standard discharge planning or Connect -Home consistent with the 
treatment condition of th e SNF at the time of the patient's enrollment.   
 
Randomization  will be conducted for all sites simultaneously by a study statistician blinded to SNF identity. 
The randomized allocation sequence of the SNF will determine the beginning and end dates for thre e 
phases of patient and caregiver enrollment: (1) standard care, (2) the pre -implementation phase when 
staff are trained and neither patients nor caregivers are enrolled, and (3) the implementation phase when 
newly enrolled patients and their caregivers re ceive Connect- Home.  
 
  
Patients and caregivers will be enrolled on a rolling basis at the rate of 4 -5 dyads per month anytime 
during the control or intervention period. There will be three phases of patient and caregiver 
enrollment: (1) standard of care (indicated by [CONTACT_624109] 2), (2) the pre -implementation phase 
when staff are trained and neit her patients nor caregivers are enrolled (indicated by [CONTACT_624110] 2), and (3) the implementation phase when newly enrolled patients and their caregivers receive 
the Connect -Home intervention (indicated by [CONTACT_624111] 2).  
  
 
  
The pri mary objectives will be assessed [ADDRESS_830961] -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_830962] -Home Protocol v 2.0 13Jul2020  20 4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIO NALE FOR STUDY DESIG N 
The study  will utilize a SW -CRT, as it retains statistical power to evaluate efficacy of the intervention on 
the primary outcome in a relatively small number of SNFs.  Observing SNF's under standard practice 
followed by [CONTACT_624112] -Home intervention is also  consistent with the actual practice of implementing 
organizational change in SNFs and  provides opportunities for evaluating implementation 
procedures.   Cluster randomization at the nursing home level reduces risk of contamination between 
control and Conne ct-Home participants (Figure 2).   
4.3 END OF STUDY DEF INITION  
The end of study will be when the study team completes the final enrolled participant's 60- day 
assessments, and all data (including the final home health care chart reviews) have been collected from 
all study subjects.   If a subject is withdrawn from the study due to an early termination caused by 
[CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_059], SNF re -admission and/or death; end of study for these patients will occur on day of early 
termination.

Subjects who discontinue following consent (i.e., post in -person questionnaires at recruitment) but prior 
to receiving the Connect -Home intervention or control will be considered screen failures. No additional 
data will be collected from the time of screen failure, but data collected prior to screen failure and 
reason for screen failure will be kept.  
5.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETEN TION  
Recruitment:  
  
The study team will obtain a limited waiver of HIPAA authorization to allow pre -screening for patient 
eligibility. The team will consult at least weekly with the Minimum Data Set Nurse, social worker, or 
other personnel involved in coordinating clinical care for newly admitted patients in  each SNF by [CONTACT_648], 
email, or in -person to identify patients that are expected to be discharged from the SNF to home, and 
subsequently screen the medical records of all patients expected to discharge from the SNF to home.   
  
After identifying potentially e ligible patients, the study team will recruit SNF patients and their 
caregivers in -person (or, when risk mitigation related to COVID -[ADDRESS_830968], we will 
recruit virtually , using an iPad and connection via ZOOM) within 10 days of their admission and  will 
review the patient's medical record to confirm eligibility. For patients with cognitive impairment, the 
team will recruit the patient's legally authorized representative to respond to survey questions as the 
patient's proxy.   
  
Recruitment will be conducted in the SNFs through in -person interactions  (or, when risk mitigation 
related to COVID -[ADDRESS_830969] , we will recruit virtually , using an iPad and connection 
via ZOOM) . If necessary, recruitment can also be conducted by [CONTACT_624113]. All participants 
will provide written informed consent ( or, when risk mitigation related to COVID -[ADDRESS_830970] , we will obtain consent verbally using an iPad an d connection via ZOOM)  for study participation .  
When written consent is not feasible, we  will obtain witnessed verbal consent with the assistance of 
nursing home personnel via the iPad and Zoom connection). L egally authorized representatives will give 
consent for patients with cognitive impairment.  Consent and HIPAA Authorization could also be 
obtained verbally in the situation that a participant is unable to physically sign these documents.   
  
  
Retention: 
  
During recruitment, study personnel will give  the patient and caregiver a study flyer providing the study 
team's contact [CONTACT_3031], a schedule of planned follow -up calls, and information regarding 
compensation for completing data collection. When study personnel is unable to provide these study 
flyers directly to the patient, the study team will provide flyers to NH staff to announce the study and 
the possibility that a study team member will speak with potential study participants in -person or

Randomization  
  
Randomization will be conducted for all 6 sites simultaneo usly by a study statistician blinded to SNF 
identity. The randomized allocation sequence of the SNF will determine the beginning and end dates for 
three phases of patient and caregiver enrollment: (1) standard of care, (2) the pre -implementation 
phase when  staff are trained and neither patients nor caregivers are enrolled, and (3) the 
implementation phase when newly enrolled patients and their caregivers receive the Connect- Home 
intervention.   
  
 
Blinding  
  
Professional data collectors from the Carolina Survey Research Lab (CSRL) will collect data from patients 
and caregivers at 7, 30, and [ADDRESS_830982] -discharge. These data collectors will be blinded to both the 
study hypothesis and to treatment group assignment.   
 
6.3 STUDY INTERVENTI ON COMPLIAN CE 
The NIH Behavior Change Consortium’s “Treatment Fidelity Protocols” will be used to ensure fidelity to 
the intervention.46 Fidelity  will be assessed in five domains as described below.  
  
Design: The researchers will use standardized tools (e.g., Connect- Home Toolkit, the EHR template and 
staff training protocols) to deliver the intervention.  
  
Training: T o prevent contamination between SNFs  during the intervention  phase, the researcher will 
train staff in individual SNFs and Connect -Home Activation RNs i n individual home health care offices. A 
detailed training protocol will be used, specifying the researcher roles, content, participants, and time 
required for training activities.  
  
Delivery:  A researcher will observe staff training activities on a random  schedule to assess fidelity of the 
trainer to the staff training protocols. The research team will develop plans to address deviations from 
the training protocol. A Training Contact [CONTACT_624114], in which researchers will record staff 
participation in training activities. Staff members will be assigned identification numbers for tracking 
participation.  
  
Receipt of Treatment: Researchers will administer post -tests to all participating staff after the staff 
training session; additional one -to-one r e-training will be provided as needed for those who score 
Connect -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_830983] -Home Protocol v 2.0 13Jul2020  28 <100%. Researchers will also use return demonstration of home visit procedures with Connect -Home 
Activation RNs, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -training as needed until nurses demonstrate a high level of ability.  
  
Enactment of Skills: The study team will audit medical records for intervention patients to assess fidelity 
to the study protocol.  Protocol elements to be assessed will include the following: a) completing the 
Transition Plan of Care; b) convening care p lan meetings; c) reviewing advance directives in the SNF; d) 
scheduling follow -up medical appointments; e) transmitting records to follow -up clinicians; g) 
completing home visits within 24 hours after dis -charge; h) reconciling medications in the patient’s  
home; i) completing the home safety evaluation; and j) communicating patient status to the on -coming 
home health nurse. As part of enactment monitoring, the Connect -Home Activation RN will keep a log 
describing medication discrepancies and the patients re ferred for a rehabilitation therapy after 
discharge home. Further, the researcher will host at least one [ADDRESS_830984] -Home Activation RN. Finally, a researcher will observe 10% of staff as they deliver 
Connect -Home and, using a standard checklist, the researcher will provide feedback about enactment of 
the Connect -Home protocols. If  in-person observations ar e not possible  (owing to risk mitigation related 
to COVID -19), we will monitor enactment fidelity  via Zoom -based observations of care plan meetings 
and/ or day of discharge teaching sessions. SNFs failing to achieve 70% of operationalized fidelity steps 
will undergo re -training.

DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTIO N 
The study will adhere to the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:  
1. The intervention is associated with adverse effects that significantly impact the risk -benefit ratio  
2. Study recruitment or retention becomes futile  
3. Any new information becomes available during the trial that necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]  
4. Other situations occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISC ONTINUATION/WITHDRAW AL FROM THE STUDY  
Subjects have the right to discontinue their participation in the Connect -Home study for any reason 
without penalty. The Investigator also may discontinue subjects from the study if he feels as if it is in the 
best interest of the subject, or if the subject is noncompliant.   
  
Due to the inclusion criteria requiring patient and caregiver participation, if either the patient or the 
caregiver withdraws or is discontinued from the study, the other subj ect will automatically be 
withdrawn.   
  
The study team will cease data collection for an individual as soon as the subject withdraws from the 
study. The study team will retain data collected while the subject was participating in the Connect -Home 
trial.  
  
If a patient enrolled in the study does not transfer from the SNF to home (i.e., they die in the SNF or are 
transferred from the SNF to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624081] -term care), their data will not be analyzed, and the 
patient and the caregiver will be withdrawn .  
  
If a patient is discharged from the SNF to home, and then dies prior to all data being collected, the data 
that was collected prior to the subject's death will be retained and included in analysis.  If a patient has a 
reported death after discharge, o nly the data collected prior to the date of death will be used for data 
collection.  
 
If a patient is discharged from the SNF to home, and then has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or re -admission to a 
SNF; the patient will be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_624115] m as they are now non -compliant for 
data collection.  The data that was collected prior to the event will be retained and included in analysis.

• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
when the event does not fit the other outcomes but, based upon appropriate medical judgement, may 
jeopardize the subject's health and may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes.  
8.2.3 CLASSIFICATION  OF AN ADVERSE EVENT

9.1 STATISTICAL HYPO THESES  
Specific aims of this research study include:  
1. Evaluate the efficacy of Connect -Home to improve SNF patient and caregiver preparedness for care at 
home.  
a. Hypothesis 1a: Compared to patients enrolled in control periods, Connect -Home patients will 
experience greater preparedness for discharge (primary outcome, measured with the CTM -15), 
assessed 7 days after discharge home  
b. Hypothesis 1b: Compared to caregivers of patients enrolled in control periods, Connect -Home 
caregivers will experience greater preparedness  for caregiving (primary outcome, measured with 
the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale), assessed [ADDRESS_831012] -Home to improve SNF patient and caregiver outcomes after discharge 
home.  
a. Hypothesis 2a: Compared  to patients enrolled in control periods, Connect -Home patients will 
experience better quality of life and function (secondary outcomes), and fewer falls requiring 
medical assistance (exploratory), measured 30 and 60 days after discharge home  
b. Hypothesis 2b: Compared to caregivers from control periods, Connect -Home caregivers will 
experience less burden and caregiver distress (secondary outcomes), measured [ADDRESS_831013] -Home to prevent acute care use up to 60 days after SNF discharge.  
a. Hypothesis 3a: Compared to patients enrolled in control periods, Connect -Home patients will 
have fewer days of acute care use (composite of emergency department and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399]) 
(secondary outcome) and more hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624087] (exploratory), measured 30 and 60 days after 
discharge home  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETE RMINATION  
Computer simulations were used to calculate statistical power for comparing control (standard 
discharge procedures) and intervention (Connect -Home) conditions fo r primary outcomes and  selected 
secondary outcomes. For each scenario,   1000 simulated datasets were generated with outcomes 
clustered within SNFs for the stepped -wedge design in Figure 2 and the respective linear mixed models 
(Log CTM -15, Preparedness for Caregiving Scale, MQo L-R, Life Space Assessment, Zarit Caregiver Burden 
scale) and MZIP random intercept model (Days of acute care use). Based on preliminary data for Aim 1, 
we assumed that the group difference in log CTM -15 scores was θ=0.15. We also assumed that 
responses fr om patients within the same SNF in the same period would have an intra -cluster correlation 
of 0.10 (ICC W).  We assumed that responses from patients or caregivers in the same site but from 
different periods would have an intra- cluster correlation of 0.05 (I CCB); together with the total variance 
of the outcome (SD2), these values determine   and in the linear mixed models of Aims 1 and 2. Under 
these assumptions and accounting for 23% dropouts, [ADDRESS_831014] -discharge will provide 
89% power to d etect an increase of 0.15 in the mean log CTM -15 score (equivalent to a 16% increase in 
Connect -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_831015] -Home Protocol v 2.0 13Jul2020  39 the mean CTM -15 score) among intervention patients relative to control patients, using a two -sided test 
at the 5% significance level. Power for Caregiver Preparedness is similarly determined.   Power for 
secondary outcomes at [ADDRESS_831016] -discharge assumes a 30% dropout rate. For the control group in 
Aim 3, we assumed a prevalence of 22% of patients having at least one day of acute care use and, 
among those patients, a tr uncated -at-zero mean of 4.0 days. These assumptions imply that the overall 
mean number of acute care use days is 0.881 and the excess zero probability is 0.776. For the 
intervention group, we assumed an overall mean acute care use days of 1.8 and excess ze ro probability 
0.685. Thus, assuming 30% dropout and (optimistically) zero intraclass correlation within SNFs, the MZIP 
model for independent outcomes has 82% power (not shown); however, the MZIP model with empi[INVESTIGATOR_624088] 71% power. If there is positive 
intraclass correlation, power will be lower. However, for days of acute -care use within 60 days of 
discharge, power is higher than for 30 days due to higher prevalence and mean number of days of ac ute 
care use.  
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
An intent to treat analysis will be used in which all patients/caregivers are included in the analysis 
according to their treatment allocation at enrollment, regardless of whether they receive the full 
interventi on. 
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANAL YSES  
9.4.1 GENERAL APPROA CH 
  
Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables. If patients or caregivers with missing covariates are 
few (< 5%), unconditional mean imputations will be used to impute missing values for continuous 
covariates and unconditional mode imputation for ca tegorical covariates. If 5% -15% of patients or 
caregivers have missing covariates, conditional mean imputation will be used. If missing covariate data 
exceed 15%, multiple imputation will be used.  Missing outcomes will not be imputed. For continuous 
variab les that are highly skewed, the statistical team will log -transform the data for analysis. All 
statistical tests will be two -tailed with 0.05 significance levels. Also, descriptive statistics will be used to 
describe intervention fidelity (receipt, deliver y and enactment). Finally, in the absence of strong 
temporal effects, balance in covariates is expected between control and intervention patients; 
supplemental analyses will involve assessing the impact of the covariates (i.e., insurance provider, SNF 
length of stay, race, gender, and others determined with bivariate analyses) on outcomes in the 
statistical models for aims [ADDRESS_831017] -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_831018] -Home Protocol v 2.0 13Jul2020  40 random effects models within the counterfactual framework: 1) for the mediator (nu mber of days of 
home health care use) as a function of treatment condition and covariates and 2) for the outcome as a 
function of treatment condition, mediator, and covariates. Outputs include indirect and direct effects of 
the intervention.  
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFI CACY ENDPOINT(S)  
  
In the models for patient preparedness for discharge (CTM -15 score), data will be included that was 
provided by [CONTACT_624119] (for patients that are not able to answer survey questions). We 
will use hier archical linear models (HLM) to compare observations between intervention and usual care 
periods for CTM -[ADDRESS_831019] -discharge. Linear mixed models or HLM allow for different 
numbers of patients per site, while accounting for correlated res ponses between patients within the 
same SNF. Let Y ijk denote the CTM -15 score for patient k in SNF i and period (enrollment month) j; (i = 1, 
6; j = 1, …, 22). The basic HLM is, where is an intercept term, is a random effect for SNF, accounts for a 
potenti al linear temporal trend,  is a random effect for period j nested within SNF i, is an indicator for 
the treatment condition (i.e., [ADDRESS_831020]- Home; [ADDRESS_831021] discharge procedures), θ is the treatment 
effect, and  is an error term. Furthermore, we ass ume a variance components structure such that all 
random effects are independent with, and where subscripts “c”, “p” and “e” denote cluster (i.e., SNF), 
period and error variance components, respectively. The correlation structure induced by [CONTACT_624120] -SNF correlation of outcomes from two patients enrolled in the same month 
(ICC W) to be different from the within -SNF correlation of outcomes from patients enrolled in different 
months (ICC B). Specifically, by [CONTACT_624121], the intraclass correlations are ICC W =, and ICC B 
=.  For CTM -15, the basic HLM model will be amended by [CONTACT_624122]: CTM -15 score source (patient or caregiver), patient age, gender and race. Due to skew ness 
of the CTM -[ADDRESS_831022] this outcome will be log -
transformed prior to analysis. The group difference in log CTM -15 scores (intervention vs. control) across 
the study periods will be estimated along wit h a 95% confidence interval. A sensitivity analysis will be 
conducted to assess whether the effect of Connect- Home depends on the number of months that an 
SNF has been operating under the Connect -Home protocol. This is achieved by [CONTACT_624123]- Home are estimated when the Connect- Home protocol has been 
implemented for ≤ 3 months versus > [ADDRESS_831023]-
Home is sustained three months following its initial implementation in th e staff training period. A similar 
linear mixed model will be applied for the Preparedness for Caregiving outcome, except that respondent 
source is not included.   
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF TH E SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S) 
  
In Aim 2, linear mixed models will be used that  are extensions of those in the Aim 1 analysis for the 
analysis of quality of life (MQoL -R), patient function (Life Space Assessment), patient falls (exploratory 
outcome), caregiver burden (Zarit scale) and distress (Distress Thermometer). The statistical team will 
augment the basic HLM in the Aim [ADDRESS_831024] -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_831025]- Home intervention and its 95% 
confidence at each time point. In hypothesis 2b, separate Poisson mixed models will be used with log 
link for each post -discharge time point in t he assessment of the intervention effect on falls with a similar 
structure for fixed and random effects as described in the Aim [ADDRESS_831026] -
discharge at these two time points. We will esti mate the incident rate ratio and its 95% confidence 
interval.  
  
The main outcome for Aim 2.3, the number of cumulative days of acute care use, (i.e., days due to re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37205]), will be modeled using separate marginalized zero -
inflated Poisson (MZIP) models with log link. The statistical team will test and estimate the overall effect 
of Connect -Home relative to standard discharge procedures through exponentiation of the treatment 
regression coefficient for the overall m ean as an incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence 
interval, basing these on empi[INVESTIGATOR_624089]. MZIP was chosen over the standard ZIP model because although a large number of zero co unts 
(event outcomes) are anticipated, the overall exposure effect of Connect- Home is of interest, and not its 
effect on an unobserved subpopulation (i.e., latent class). Separate time point -specific generalized linear 
mixed models (GLMM) with logit link   will be used for the binary outcome of whether a resident visited 
the ED within [ADDRESS_831027]. Data about 
caregivers will be collected in person or by [CONTACT_648] .

10.1.[ADDRESS_831034] -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions 
from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home  Version 2.[ADDRESS_831035] POLICY  
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Policy on Conflicts of Interest and Commitment includes 
a rebuttable presumption that an inve stigator may not conduct human subjects’ research that is related 
to a financial interest of the investigator (or immediate family) except in compelling circumstances. 
Compelling circumstances are those facts that convince the reviewer that a covered indiv idual who has a 
financial interest should be permitted to conduct human subjects’ research, taking into account the 
following factors:  
• The nature of the research,   
• The nature and magnitude of the financial interest   
• How closely the financial interest is re lated to the research  
• The extent to which the interest may be affected by [CONTACT_53775]   
• The degree of risk to the human subjects involved that is inherent in the research protocol   
• The extent to which the investigator is uniquely qualified to perform a res earch study with important 
public benefit   
• The extent to which the interest is amenable to effective oversight and management.   
The applicable UNC -Chapel Hill COI Chair and/or Committee takes into these criteria into account when 
reviewing any disclosed co nflict of interest in the context of the human study.  
• The COI Chair or Committee considers the following factors into their review: How the research is 
supported or financed,  
• The nature and extent of the conflict,   
• The role and responsibilities of the conf licted individual in the design, conduct, and reporting of the 
research, and   
• The ability of the conflicted individual to influence the outcome of the research.  
The IRB has final authority to determine whether the research, the COI, and the related managem ent 
plan, if any, allow the research to be approved.

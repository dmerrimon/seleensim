5.3.4  Overview of the investigational protocol  
The investigational protocol describes a study  designed to compare ultra -high resolution 
transrectal micro -ultrasound ( micro -US), and multi -parametric MRI (mpMRI).  These modalities 
are both used clinically to identify targets for prostate biopsy, however little data is available to compare their sens itivity.  While mpMRI is used clinically to identify targets for biopsy, it is not 
used for real -time biopsy guidance due to challenges performing the biopsy procedure within the 
MRI gantry.  Instead, targets identified on mpMRI are sampled during transrec tal ultrasound 
guided biopsy as part of the prostate biopsy procedure, often using software assisted fusion 
products.  For this investigation, the biopsy procedure will be guided by [CONTACT_542873] -US 
(current standard of care at Urology San Antonio), an d will include systematic (standard, random, 
extended sextant) plus image -guided prostate biopsies among men with clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_542845].  The FusionVu software -assisted fusion 
feature will be used to sample mpMRI targets .   
 This investigation furthers two cohort studies which demonstrate similar or superior sensitivity for 
micro -US over mpMRI from two centers in Europe.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Qualified Gels  
Exact Imaging  follows Health Canada and FDA’s recommendations for the use of sterile gels for 
invasive procedures that pass a device through tissue (i.e., in biopsy procedures).  
 
ExactVu  is designed to introduce no increased risk when compared to conventional ultrasound, 
and as such, Exact Imaging  accepts Urology San Antonio  may have approved institutional 
protocols that call for the use of non -sterile gel for transrectal biopsy procedures.   
 Where non -sterile ultrasound gel is used, investigators must take steps to ensure that the 
product being used is not contaminated, and the container must be sealed appropriately when not 
in use.  Gels whose packaging indicates that they are to be used for external procedures only 
must not be used.  Where non -sterile ultras ound gel is used, Exact Imaging  recommends the use 
of single -dose gels.

micro -US uses high frequencies (2 9 MHz) to improve resolution of prostate ultrasound images , 
and provides a protocol for assessing risk in these images known as PRI-MUS
TM (Prostate Risk 
Identification using Micro-Ultrasound)7. Using this technology, the predecessor  of ExactVu  was 
recently demonstrated by a team at Johns Hopkins  Medical to have improved ability to image 
cancerous foci over conventional -ultrasound , and to have potential improved efficacy in 
identifying higher grade tumors3.  More recent studies have extended these findings, by [CONTACT_542881] -US to conventional -ultrasound4 and preliminary

to compare the differences between Ultra High Resolution (UHR) and Low Resolution (LR) 
transrectal ultrasound in their ability to detect cancerous foci in 20 patients.  
 
Patients were imaged pre -operatively with both micro -US and LR -TRUS. Areas of altered 
echogenicity ≥ 5mm on sagittal views were identified by a radiologist with an expertise in 
ultrasound blinded to pathology results. Actual areas of prostate cancer ≥5mm i dentified at 
sagittally-sectioned RP specimen were correlated to abnormal foci on both imaging modalities. 
Sensitivity and specificity analysis were performed for each imaging modality. A total of 56 
cancerous foci were pathologically identified. micro -US was superior to LR -TRUS in the 
identification of these foci (p = 0.01).

conventional ultrasound (p=0.02).  mpMRI lesions were retrospec tively visible under micro -US, 
making it easier to perform accurate targeted biopsy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Previous clinical experience: Reports in the literature from cohort 
studies  
Cohort studies are available from two European centers demonstrating promising detection rates 
and sensitivity relative to mpMRI.  Astobieta et al.1 reported on 41 consecutive subjects biopsied 
using the ExactVu micro -ultrasound system with available mpMRI studies for comparison and 
targeted biopsy.  mpMRI correctly predicted 28/41 subjects with clinically significant prostate cancer (68% sensitivity)  while micro -ultrasound predicted 40/41 (98% sensitivity).  This 
improvement in sensitivity was significant with p<0.001.  
 Similarly, Lughezzani et al

mpMRI was similar at 85%.

5.7 Objectives and Hypothesis  
5.7.1  Objectives  
Primary Outcome: Comparison of subject -level detection rate of clinically significant cancer 
(csPCa, defined as ISUP 2 or higher) between micro -ultrasound targeted biopsy  and mpMRI 
targeted biopsy .  
 
Secondary (unpowered) Outcomes:   
• Compare lesion size and shape between mpMRI and micro -ultrasound (follow -up with 
detailed whole -mount pathology when available)  
• Compare detailed pathological findings (cribiform structure, density of cancer, subtype of 
cancer) with imaging findings in both modalities  
• Identify percentage of micro -ultrasound lesions (with positive biopsy result) that ca n be 
identified retrospectively using mpMRI (requires retrospective re -reading of mpMRI 
sequences given list of micro -ultrasound targets)  
• Identify percentage of mpMRI lesions (with positive biopsy result) that can be identified 
retrospectively using micro -ultrasound (requires retrospective re -reading of micro -
ultrasound sweeps given list of mpMRI targets)  
5.7.2  Hypothesis  
Primary Hypothesis : Micro -ultrasound provides non -inferior (10% margin) sensitivity to detect 
csPCa using targeted samples compared to mpMRI.  
 
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- [ADDRESS_708520] routine care (i.e., prostate biopsy) per standard indications, 
using transrectal ultrasound guidance. Micro -US can reliably image the perip heral zone of the 
prostate.  This is done in a transr ectal approach, as is conventional ultrasound .  
5.8.1  General  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Type of clinical investigation  
The investigation  is a study where all subjects have  an indication for prostate biopsy.  This will 
allow the most general assessment of the study’s main objective which is comparing the imaging 
quality of micro -US with mpMRI .  Each subject will act as their own control in order to make the 
resulting images a s comparable as possible.  This multiple -imaging design also reduces the 
number of subjects needed without substantially increasing risk, subject discomfort, or procedure 
time.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Avoiding bias  
The mpMRI report will be blinded from Operator [ADDRESS_708521] full knowledge of the mpMRI report and images, but will not observe the micro -
ultrasound targeting portion of the pro cedure or see the resulting target locations.  Separate 
operators will complete the two phases of the procedure to avoid bias from the micro -ultrasound 
targets interfering with biopsy site selection for mpMRI targets.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Endpoints  
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in each 
subject .  The per -subject presence of cancer will be determined based on a positive biopsy from 
any sample, targeted or systematic.  Patient -level sensitivity for a given imaging modality will be 
determined through systematic biopsy results plus targeted samples taken using only that 
modality. In this way we approximate clinical reality of using a given modality for systematic plus 
targeted biopsy.  
 
Secondary endpoint s 
Sensitivity of targeted -only samples for each modality will also be calculated  in order to 
determine the effectiveness of a targeted only biopsy technique in each case.  Presence of cancer 
per-target will also be assessed, along with detailed pathological findings, and targeting modality 
identifying the lesion.  Size and shape of lesions will also be recorded from recorded images.  
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- [ADDRESS_708522] Imaging , Inc. CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 38 [IP_ADDRESS]  Variables  
The sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve for accurate identification of clinically 
significant prostate cancer for each modality will be determined, along with the corresponding 
credible intervals . Summary statistics will be provided for all modalities.  
 Biopsy results may fall into 4 categories based on pathology review:  
 
1. Clinically significant cancer (GS > 6 )  
2. Clinically insignificant cancer (GS = 6 ) 
3. Cancer precursors (HGPIN, Atypia)  
4. Benign (including findings of Prostatitis)  
 
Distribution of findings for all categories, and comparison of these distributions between 
modalities will also be reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessing variables 
The analysis to be performed on data collected during the investigation will be done on software customized and validated by [CONTACT_542879].  This software will be maintained as per Exact 
Imaging’s internal operating procedures .  The software will not be ‘calibrated’ other than if there 
are instances where the software does not perform as required against unusual or exceptional data. 
 
A third -party statistician will be contracted to independently confirm all results.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Replacing subjects  
Case data for all enrolled study subjects will be included in the analyses.  Because a subject’s 
involvement ends following his biopsy procedure, and because it is not expected that a subject 
will drop -out after his biopsy procedure, the  need to replace subjects is expected to be unlikely.  
 
If a subject needs to be replaced, he will be consented as per processes described for all study 
subjects.  
5.8.2  Medical  devices and comparators  
The ExactVu micro -ultrasound system with high -frequency EV29L transducer will be used.  The 
FusionVu software package will be used for software assistance during mpMRI -US fusion.  This 
device, including all software and hardware components are cleared by [CONTACT_542884].  
5.8.3  Subjects  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inclusion criteria for subject selection 
Subjects will be recruited to participate in the investigation as follows:

1. Men with anorectal abnormalities preventing TRUS -guided prostate biopsy  
2. Men who are unable to provide their own informed consent  
3. Prostate volume on MRI > 100cc  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Criteria and procedures for subjec t withdrawal or discontinuation  
Subjects may withdraw fr om the investigation at any time with no effect on their future care.   
 
If a subject wishes to stop participating in the investigation, they are to do so by [CONTACT_542885] [INVESTIGATOR_542854].  
 If a subject withdraws from the investigation prior to having his biopsy procedure performed, the 
biopsy procedure  will be performed as per the normal standard of care.  There will be no further 
follow -up with this subject in the context of this investigation.  
 Data considerations for this case are provided in section 5.9. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Point of enrolment

[IP_ADDRESS]  Site Visits  
Further to the description of Exact Imaging ’s role as the Study Monitor for the investigation, Exact 
Imaging will ensure the quality of data related to the investigation by:  
• on-site visit s to Urology San Antonio  at the beginning and end of the study  
• thorough review of CRF data to identify and follow -up on missing data, inconsistent data, 
data outliers, and potential CIP deviations that may be indicative of systemic or significant 
errors in data collection and reporting  
• 100% verification of all data  
 
An on-site visit at the beginning of the investigation  will include the following activities:  
1. Review of supplies required for the investigation  
a. Check that there continues to be an adequate supply of sterile transducer sheaths  
and needle guides  
 An on-site visit at the beginning of the investigation  will include the following activities:  
1. Review issues with investigators  
a. Study Monitor will d iscuss and investigate any performance issues and device 
deficiencies and resolved as required .  These issues will be documented and signed 
by [CONTACT_39613], including details about steps taken to resolve issues  
b. Review any changes to the investigative team and update details in the CIP as required  
c. Provide training where changes to the investigative team require s it 
 
2. Review subject e nrolment  
 
3. Review study data  
a. Review data collected on CRF  
b. Check CRF for completeness and accuracy.  Ensure CRFs are filled out properly  
c. Check ExactVu  for images.  There must be one image saved on the system to  
correspond to each biopsy core . 
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- [ADDRESS_708530] information about the 
location of the prostate where biopsy samples were taken, to provide  a summary of findings from 
the pathology report entered locally, along with other notes from investigators.  
 Source data will be recorded on case report forms (CRFs) as follows:  
• For each of the 12 systematic biopsy sample s, investigators  will indicate the PRI-MUS 
score  for micro -US.  (For every biopsy sample, an image of the biopsy location will be 
saved on ExactVu  as well .) 
• For each additional targeted biopsy sample, investigator will indicate the location and the 
PRI-MUS score  for micro -US.  (For every b iopsy sample, an image of the biopsy location 
will be saved on ExactVu.) 
• Pathology report will be entered on the CRF and a copy attached to the CRF.  This is 
checked for accuracy by [CONTACT_079] . 
• mpMRI report will be entered on the CRF and a copy attached to the CRF.  This is checked 
for accuracy by [CONTACT_079].  
 
Note that the PRI -MUS protocol used here is derived from Ghai et al.
7.  This protocol for assessing 
risk in the micro -US images is investigational and has not been evaluated by [CONTACT_1622].   
  
Along with the data accuracy checks listed above, Exact Imaging  will also check data prior to and 
during analysis  as follows:  
• Check pathology reports against what is entered on the CRF  
• Logic checks on data, and follow -up on unusual data.  (For example, if there is a case in 
which biopsy samples from targeted needles don't indicate cancer and sample s from 
systematic  needles do show cancer, an investigation would follow.)  
 
Analysis of data is described in the subsections of section 5.9. 
 
The case report form to be used in this investigation is controlled as per Exact Imaging ’s standard 
operating procedures .

It is the responsibility of the Study Coordinator (or designate) to de-identify subjects, and provide 
the resulting subject identifier to those involved with the analysis of the case data.   This subject 
identifier will be recorded on CRFs, on ExactVu , and on pathology records.  Lists of subjects' 
names and identifying info rmation will be maintained separately from case report forms , and will 
be accessible to the Study Coordinator (or Urology San Antonio  designate) . 
 
Similar de -identification will be applied to any DICOM imaging files that may exist for a subject

The primary endpoint is the relative detection rate (sensitivity) between mpMRI and micro -
ultrasound for significant prostate cancer at a subject level.  Power is based on the sensitivity of 
the test.  Prevalence is assumed to be 60%. 
H0: Sensitivity of micro -ultrasound/Sensitivity of mpMRI ≤ δ = 0.76 
H1: Sensitivity of micro -ultrasound/Sensitivity of mpMRI > δ = 0.76 
where δ was based on results of comparing mpMRI to TRUS as noted below.  
Specificity wi ll be similarly tested.  That is:  
H0: Specificity of micro -ultrasound/ Specificity of mpMRI ≤ δ = 0.67 
H1: Specificity of micro -ultrasound/ Specificity of mpMRI > δ = 0.[ADDRESS_708533] ratio of 
0.52 (95% CI: 0.45- 0.60) using McNemar’s test. In order to preserve the effect of mpMRI versus 
TRUS as seen in this study, the non -inferiority margin for the test ratio of 0. 76 (24%) was chosen 
as being equal to 50% of the effect from  the point estimate of 0.52  to a ratio of unity (equal 
sensitivity).  Then, the lower bound of the test ratio must not exceed 0. [ADDRESS_708534] 50% of the effect of mpMRI

ratio.  
CIP and Study Protocol for EVU-2018- [ADDRESS_708535] ratio of 2.34 (2. 08–
2.68).  In the prostate biopsy procedure, since sampling is required regardless of imaging 
outcome (systematic sampling), specificity is less important.  Still, we would like to preserve a 
reasonable specificity similar to mpMRI, therefore we select a non -inferiority margin of 0.67, or 
not more than 50% worse than the existing difference between mpMRI and TRUS  (2.34*1.5 ratio 
to TRUS, 1/1.5=0.67 ratio to mpMRI) .

sensitivity, then 120 subjects would be required to provide 80% p ower to reject the null 
hypothesis, assuming 80% agreement between the methods.

prostate biopsy is indicated regardless of the assigned imaging modality.  
 
5.9.5  Pass/fail criteria  
The primary outcome of the study will fail if micro -ultrasound targeted biopsy fails to identify 
cancer in significantly more subjects than mpMRI  targeted biopsy .  This will be quantified by 
[CONTACT_542888] -sided 95% confidence interval bound  of the ratio of the two 
sensitivities , which must not be less than 76%. 
5.9.[ADDRESS_708538] Imaging  shall promptly inform the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_542855](s) for this.  
 If the investigation is terminated early, no follow -up with subjects is required, since the standard

This will allow data to be collected about the number of patients that withdrew from the 
investigation prior to the biopsy procedure, and the number that withdrew after the procedure.  
 The same process will be applied to any circumstance of incomplete or incorrect data, with an

5.20  Critical Literature Review  
(Literature reviewed June 2 6 2018) 
 
Introduction  
The current standard of care for detection and monitoring of prostate cancer is the transrectal 
ultrasound -guided biopsy (TRUS)12. This procedure is typi[INVESTIGATOR_542859] a standard low -
resolution ultrasound system (LR -TRUS), which does not reliably image cancerous lesions within 
the prostate.  62%  of the time, no abnormalities are found using LR -TRUS imaging even in men 
with biopsy -confirmed prostate cancer3. This large percentage of lesions which are not visible 
during traditional LR -TRUS procedures require most protocols to use the modality only to 
visualize the prostate and guide systematic 12 -core biopsies, although biopsies are targeted when 
a lesion is visible.  Current research suggests that a large number of cancers are missed due to 
this mostly non -targeted, systematic approach13,14. Improving visualization of cancerous lesions 
during biopsy would improve detection rates, reduce the need for repeat biopsy, and potentially allow active surveillance pr otocols to follow tumors visually, rather than with periodic biopsy.  
 Ultra-high resolution TRUS ( micro -US) utilizes higher frequencies (21MHz) tha n LR-TRUS in order 
to improve the resolution of prostate images.  This has been demonstrated to improve sensitivity 
to detect cance r during the biopsy procedure
1–4,7,8.  A recent study by [CONTACT_542895] -TRUS in the ability to image cancerous foci, particularly for higher grade 
tumors3.  These results have been supported by [CONTACT_542896] a screening population, 
leading to the development of the PRI -MUS risk identifi cation protocol7.  This study will attempt to 
further these results by [CONTACT_1541] a blinded comparison of micro -US and mpMR I in men 
undergoing prostate biopsy .  The ability to visualize the cancerous foci in these subjects would be 
of significant value to increase confidence in the event of a negative biopsy result and help guide 
selection of therapy in the event of insignificant or localized disease .

Critical evaluation of literature  
Device description  
The micro -US device is the next generation of the one  used d uring our group’s previous study2.  
This new commercial version of the device has received marketing clearance in the [LOCATION_002] 
from the FDA.  The intended use of the device is to visualize the prostate in order to guide the 
TRUS biopsy.  Other than th e higher resolution, this is equivalent to a standard ultrasound device 
of the type commonly used to guide TRUS procedures and that represents the current standard of care.   
 
The micro -US device provides a high -resolution image of the prostate, with a fie ld of view that 
includes the entire prostate (subject to the size constraints in the screening  exclusion criteria).  
More detail on the device itself and safety tests conducted in order to comply with IEC medical 
device standards is identified in this CIP.  
 
Analysis of selected literature  
There is significant literature demonstrating the use of high -frequency ultrasound for in vivo 
visualization of both healthy and cancerous tissue.  Much of this literature is in the form of pre -
clinical animal models
5, but the device was also used in a previous clinical trial at Johns Hopkins 
University2.  This previous clinical trial from our group demonstrated improved visualization of 
cancerous foci by [CONTACT_84798] -US compared to LR -TRUS with superiority in both sensitivity and  
specificity when compared to pathological findings on radical prostatectomy2.  This work has been 
published in a highly regarded international peer -reviewed journal. Another clinical trial has 
recently completed , run by [CONTACT_27156] ( WIRB Protocol 20131849) .  Data from the first half of this 
trial was used to develop the PRI -MUS risk identification protocol7.  This large, randomized clinical 
trial was designed to demonstrate improved cancer detection rates in men without a known 
history of prostate cancer (a screening population of 2000 men). The results of this trial are now 
available, and suggest significan tly improved sensitivity over conventional ultrasound.[ADDRESS_708556], all other studies were pre -1990 
and are considered less relevant due to substantial improvements in imaging technology.  These 
studies vary considerably in the aggressiveness of their targ eting, with Barish et al.
15 
demonstrating a se nsitivity of 40% (specificity 80%, N=544) and Nelson et al.16 a sensitivity of 
only 26% (specificity 89%, N=137).  Weighted average sensitivity and specificity are 37.2% and 
81.8% respectively.  This sensitivity value  is very close to that found during our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]3 
against the more accurate radical prostatectomy (RP)  reference (37.7%), however the specificity 
value in that study was much lower (65.4%).  This may be due to the low N=25 of that study, or the greater accuracy of the RP reference.  If micro -US provides a more accurate biopsy reference 
(closer to RP), we m ay expect a specificity between 81.8% and 65.4%.   The PROMIS trial
[ADDRESS_708557] prostate cancer.  This value is reported as 48%, which demonstrates the value o f 
the additional systematic biopsy cores due to the poor sensitivity of targeted only sampling using 
this modality. This higher value will be used to define the non- inferiority threshold, in order to be 
as rigorous as possible.  
 
The PROMIS trial17,[ADDRESS_708558] quality evidence of prevalence in this population, using 
template mappi[INVESTIGATOR_542860] 308/572 subjects (54%).   
This is a reasonable value given other meta -analyses demonstrating detection rates from 24% -
87% in the literature19–21. 
 Sensitivity of mpMRI has varied widely in the literature as demonstrated by [CONTACT_542897] -
analyses
19,21,22, showing detection rates ranging from 24% -87%.  The PROMIS trial17 found a 
sensitivity of 88% for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer, but did not perform targeted 
biops y.  Therefore, this value could be seen as a maximum possible when perfect targeting and 
histopathology is assumed.  In cases with targeted biopsy, such as the PRECISION trial23, mpMRI 
detected significant cancer in 38% of the arm vs. 26% in th e systematic biopsy arm.  Assuming a 
similar 54% incidence this amounts to sensitivities of 70% and 48% respectively which compare 
well with our own feasibility cohorts demonstrating sensitivities of 56 -85% for mpMRI1,2,[ADDRESS_708559] sensitivities of 83% (N=60)2, 98% (N=79)1, and 61% (N=286)4 for a 
weighted average of 71%.  While this average is biased towards the earlier data from the 
randomized trial, this study was conducted on an early version of the device with little training on 
the PRI -MUS ris k identification protocol, therefore we expect this to underestimate the true 
sensitivity of the micro -US modality.  
 Given an incidence of approximately 50% with sensitivities of mpMRI and Micro -US of 
approximately 66% and 75% respectively, 108 subjects a re required to provide 80% confidence 
of achieving non -inferiority within 20%.  This non -inferiority bound was chosen to maintain at 
least 50% of the benefit of mpMRI over conventional systematic biopsy providing a sensitivity of 
approximately 48%.  
 
Evalua tion of hazards, risks and safety measures  
The risks associated with the TRUS biopsy procedure are well captured in the literature, and 
represent the normal standard -of-care for subjects with the inclusion criteria of this study
6,24– 27.  
Data from our previous study , and preliminary data from our ongoing clinical trial,  suggest that 
these risks are not significantly altered due to the micro -US probe3.  Risk minimization will follow 
the same standard -of-care procedures as LR -TRUS, including antibiotic prophylaxis and 
management of bleeding risk6,24– 27. 
Risks associated with study data collection will be managed by [CONTACT_39613], as described in this CIP.  
 Statistical and weighting methods  
All clinical studies were weighted based on enrollment numbers, unless otherwise stated or 
specifically excluded for differences in protocol or enrollment. Care was taken to identify studies with patients drawn from the same population which would not be i ndependent.  
 
Conclusions  
micro -US is a promising modality for visualizing cancer in TRUS -guided biopsy procedures. A 
multiple -imaging case series  allows for direct comparison between modalities  and maintains 
standard -of-care for all patients with little or no additional risk.  Enrolment numbers are 
reasonable and  consistent with other human studies in this area.

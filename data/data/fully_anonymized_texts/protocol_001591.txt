Protocol Version Date: January 27, 2021   
2) Objectives  
The objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_775240] a new, first of its kind, FDA 510k-cleared  positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanner, called EXPLORER. Built 
by [CONTACT_775251] (UIH)1 in collaboration with investigators at UC 
Davis, EXPLORER has the potential to significantly alter the practice of PET/CT2,3. 
This initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_775241]:       
Objective 1: To obtain preliminary data on (a) delayed, (b) low-dose and (c) 
total body dynamic acquisitions on  the EXPLORER PET/CT scanner. 
Objective 2: (d) To obtain preliminary data regarding possible impacts on 
18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG ) PET image quantification related to use of 
intravenous iodinated contrast agent with the EXPLORER PET/CT scanner. 
3) Background  
The 194 cm long EXPLORER total-body PET scanner is the world’s first 
device to offer the ability to tomographically image all parts of the body simultaneously. It has the potential for a signal sensitivity gain of ~ 40-fold 
compared to existing commercially available devices for total-body applications. 
Spatial resolution is also comparable to or better than all other commercially 
available clinical devices available today.
2-4 Answering the basic questions that this 
new equipment poses constitutes an important advancement for both clinical and 
academic settings. 
(A) The distribution of radiotracer activity depends on post-injection imaging time 
for both anatomical structure and pathologic processes. Different anatomic 
structures and different pathologic abnormalities are characterized by [CONTACT_775252]-
activity curves.[ADDRESS_1064872] commonly-used PET 
radiotracer 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG ) concentration in tissues over a twelve-
hour period.    In addition, for precise characterization of FDG clearance through 
the urinary system we will assess radiotracer activity in urine collected from 
PROTOCOL TITLE: [ 1341792] EXPLORER PET/CT: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_775238] 9   01/27/[ADDRESS_1064873] 25 years8. 
(B) EXPLORER PET/CT allows for the possibility of very low-dose imaging. [ADDRESS_1064874] information on the 
statistical quality of low-dose scans with EXPLORER and this information is essential for power calculations for future studies. 
(C) EXPLORER  whole body PET/CT  is the only scanner in the world capable of 
acquiring total body dynamic images. Acquisition of dynamic images will allow 
new applications such as organ perfusion imaging.
7 Available PET/CT scanners can 
obtain perfusion images only on a portion of the body as large as their axial field of 
view, generally anywhere between 15-30 cm. EXPLORER can cover the total body 
and provide useful perfusion data in addition to early FDG biodistribution data and 
other functional parameters. We seek to obtain preliminary data regarding perfusion 
and early biodistribution images; this will be vitally important for the design of 
future studies. 
(D) Intravenous iodinated contrast is commonly used in routine CT to increase the 
visualization of both anatomic and pathologic processes. Physically, the presence of 
iodine atoms increases  the attenuation coefficient for CT radiation of the tissues in 
which it distributes by [CONTACT_775253]-section for photoelectric interactions. 
Applying attenuation correction algorithm s for PET using contrast CT images has 
the potential to overcorrect the PET emission signal (which is much less susceptible 
to photoelectric interactions), introducing possibly significant errors in the final 
uptake quantification. While several studies have demonstrated that there is no 
statistically significant increase in uptake values upon injection of iodinated contrast 
when normal anatomic structures are assessed, at the present time, there is no study validating the use of contrast enhanced CT for attenuation correction purposes on 
the EXPLORER PET/CT scanner. We seek to obtain preliminary data to understand 
the impact of  intravenous iodinated contrast agent on quantification of PET images.

7) Procedures Involved  
Subject recruitment: 
Up to 15 subjects per arm (please see below) will be recruited by [CONTACT_3553] a 
flyer posted in specific areas: the Division of Nuclear Medicine (Davis Tower, 
Ambulatory Care Center (ACC)), the UC Davis Explorer Molecular Imaging Center 
located at [ADDRESS_1064878]. Ramsey Badawi (ACC Suite 0505), the Radiology Academic office 
(ACC, Suite 3100), and the research laboratories of [CONTACT_256582] and [CONTACT_775263] (Main campus, GBSF). In addition, flyers will be posted in other academic 
offices at ACC including cardiology, ophthalmology, ort hopedics, etc. 
Additionally, the study will be announced on the EXPLORER website: https://explorer.ucdavis.edu/
  
Study procedures: 
At the time of the consenting and screening visit, a  study-specific 
Inclusion/Exclusion source document will be used to determinate eligibility for this 
study after obtaining informed consent. The consenting and screening visit will 
occur at either the ACC Building Suite 3100, in the Main Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_775244]  ([ADDRESS_1064879], 
Sacramento) not earlier than [ADDRESS_1064880] can be enrolled in only one Arm; the 
participant can choose which Arm of the study he or she wants to be enrolled in 
until the recruitment for the specific Arm is completed.  For participants enrolled in 
Arm 3, if recent (within 1 month)10 serum creatinine and/or GFR results are not 
available, an order will be placed for participants to go to a UC Davis Health lab for 
this testing, at no charge to them prior to the imaging visit. For the subject for whom 
the screening requires renal function tests, the doctor will receive notification of test results through the EMR system directly from the UC Davis Health lab. The doctor 
will review the results (in the subjects to whom any of th ese tests apply) and will  
report on the screening form the results and will state eligibility of the subject for 
the study. 
Participants will be asked to fast for 6 hours prior to arriving at the 
EXPLORER Molecular Imaging Center ([ADDRESS_1064881], Sacramento) on the 
day of their PET imaging study visit. A technologist will screen the participants  to 
evaluate their readiness for PET scanning  using the standard UC Davis Radiology 
approved form. A urine pregnancy test will be administered to all women of child-
bearing potential, at no charge. Blood glucose level will be tested using the standard 
PROTOCOL TITLE: [ 1341792] EXPLORER PET/CT: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_775238] 9   01/27/[ADDRESS_1064882] operating procedures, at no charge. Following this, 
an intravenous (IV) line will be placed in the forearm by [CONTACT_115308]/CT 
technologist or study physician and the participant will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_775245].  From the time of injection with FDG we will collect urine from all subjects until the scan visit at EXPLORER is complete.  Subjects will be asked to 
urinate into a portable unisex urinal.  After the total amount of excreted FDG is 
assessed and recorded, we will dispose of the urine sample. We will also ask all subjects if they had a bowel movement from the time they are injected with FDG until they complete their scan(s). 
Arm 1 (N=15; delayed imaging acquisition): 
For Study Arm 1, 10 +/ -2 mCi of 
18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) will be hand 
injected through the IV and a 60- minute dynamic scan will begin on EXPLORER. 
The IV line will be removed after dynamic acquisition. The dynamic scan will be 
preceded  by [CONTACT_775254]-dose (estimated dose of 1.298 mSv) CT scan.  This CT scan 
will provide information for attenuation correction for the PET data. At [ADDRESS_1064883] (estimated dose of 7.44 
mSv) will be obtained both for anatomic localization and for attenuation correction purposes. Prior to each of the later time-points (3-, 6-, 9- and 12-hours), an ultra 
low-dose (estimated dose of 1.298 mSv) CT scan will be acquired. This scan will 
be for attenuation correction purposes only. Following the 12-hour scan, the participant’s study visit will be completed. Participants will be monitored for 
adverse reactions related to prolonged fasting (e.g. hypoglycemia) between 
scanning sessions. In addition, low carbohydrate snacks will be available following the 3-hour scan. 
 
Arm 2 (N=15; low FDG dose imaging):  
For Study Arm 2, 0.5 +/- 0.1 mCi of 
18F-FDG (1/20th of the standard dose)  
will be hand injected through the IV and a 60-minute dynamic scan will begin on 
EXPLORER. The dynamic scan will be preceded by [CONTACT_377483]-low- dose CT scan   
(estimated dose of 1.298 mSv) for attenuation correction. The standard 20-minute 
EXPLORER scan obtained at [ADDRESS_1064884] 
(estimated dose of 7.44 mSv) for attenuation and co-localization. The  standard 20-
PROTOCOL TITLE: [ 1341792] EXPLORER PET/CT: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_775238] 9   01/27/[ADDRESS_1064885] scan (estimated dose of 1.298 mSv) for attenuation correction only. 
 
Arm 3 (N=15; comparison PET images reconstructed using CT-based 
attenuation correction acquired with and without iodinated contrast enhancement ):  
For Study Arm 3, 10 +/-[ADDRESS_1064886] scan (estimated dose of 1.298 mSv) will be acquired for 
attenuation correction purposes only. At [ADDRESS_1064887] (estimated dose of 7.44 mSv) will be acquired vertex to toes.  
Iodinated  contrast (150 cc of iodine Omnipaque 350) will then be intravenously 
injected (through the same IV placed to inject FDG) at 3 ml/sec while the patient 
remains still on the scanner and a second low- dose CT will be acquired. Finally, a 
20-minute PET acquisi tion will be performed. The IV line will be removed after 
completion of the study.  
Patients on all arms All patients will undergo a brain MRI scan (without contrast), within  90 days 
of the PET/CT visits.  The rationale for the MRI study is to provide a detailed 
anatomical map, which is not obtainable by [CONTACT_4654].
[ADDRESS_1064888] spin echo sequences will be 
obtained.  The PET/CT images created for this study are for research and are not meant to 
evaluate subject health, as they would be if they were part of a clinical (non-
research) visit to the doctor or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The images will not receive any routine 
clinical review by [CONTACT_115310]/CT scans. This means that some 
findings may be overlooked or misinterpreted.  However, if the PET/CT 
technologists do notice findings that cause concern, they will notify the Study Radiologist.   Additionally, if a member of the research team notices any findings 
that cause concern while conducting image review for study purposes, they will 
notify the Study Radiologist. The Study Radiologist will conduct a brief review of 
part of the study images for quality purposes.   If the Study Radiologist thinks a 
clinical problem is present, one of the IRB-approved study physicians will discuss 
these possible problems with the subject within 8 weeks or immediately upon 
recognition of any critical finding that requires immediate and/or urgent intervention as described in the Department of Radiology Critical Findings policy 
(full dataset of images are sometimes not available for review in less than 3 days).  
Upon written request, we will provide the subject with a copy of a subset of their 
CT images to take to the physician of their choosing. A subset of PET images may 
also be shared with the subject unless the images from the study are clinically 
PROTOCOL TITLE: [ 1341792] EXPLORER PET/CT: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_775238] 9   01/27/[ADDRESS_1064889] intellectual property (e.g. 
proprietary radiotracers). We will send a standard letter to the designated licensed 
medical provider identified by [CONTACT_115311] a copy of the subject’s 
radiology report.  The standard letter will state that (i) the subject’s images were 
acquired exclusively for a research study and incidental findings that may be 
related to a medical condition were observed by a UC Davis radiologist; (ii) the images did not receive any dedicated routine clinical review and findings may 
have been overlooked or misinterpreted; (iii) the subject’s physician can contact 
[CONTACT_775255]’s findings. In addition, [CONTACT_115341] or a designee will contact [CONTACT_775256]-up, if any, they received. 
They  will also ask questions related to subject’s history of cancer, history of respi[INVESTIGATOR_23697], and cigarette smoking history.  
 
If there are findings on any of the scans that can deem the subject as not meeting 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g. metastatic disease, marked claustrophobia 
leading to incomplete scans. etc), this event will be reported and the subject will 
be excluded from the study. An additional participant will be added to meet the 
recruitment target of that specific arm. 
   
 
Participants will be compensated with gift cards at a rate of $25 (upon enrollment 
and radiotracer injection), plus an additional $25 for each hour of participation as 
follows:  
• Arm 1:  up to 13 hours + Brain MRI scan: 1 hour ($25); total of $375 
• Arm 2: up to 4 hours + Brain MRI scan: 1 hour ($25); total of $ 150 
• Arm 3: up to 2 hours + Brain MRI scan: 1 hour ($25) + $50 for 
creatinine testing ; total of $ 150 
 
There is no compensation associated with initial consenting and screening visit 
and also with the optional visit(s) intended to discuss scan findings with study 
doctors.

Study Schema:  
 
   
Data analysis plan:  
Image reconstruction and analysis: Data from EXPLORER (all the three study 
arms) will be acquired in listmode. Data will be reconstructed using manufacturer’s 
recommendations. Image quality, quantitative comparisons and preliminary 
biodistribution data collection will be performed by [CONTACT_115314] 
(ROIs) drawn in different organs and tissue types where pi[INVESTIGATOR_775246].  
Statistical considerations: 
Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_115290] a first-of-its kind scanner, no formal power 
analysis is presented.  
Exploratory data analysis will be conducted to examine the distribution of the data.  
Graphical methods including box-plots and histograms will be employed to 
examine the distributions of the measures. For all continuous variables , descriptive 
statistics, including means, ranges, and standard deviations will be computed. 
Ninety-five percent confidence intervals will be computed for means and 
proportions to obtain interval estimates of all measurements across image. For 
categorical data, frequency, proportions, and percentages will be calculated. 
8) Data and/or Specimen Management and Confidentiality  
At the time of data acquisition, identifiable information will be entered in the 
UC Davis system database. Electronic image files, radiation dose reports and 
pertinent medical information will be stored on the EXPLORER research cluster at 

PROTOCOL TITLE: [ 1341792] EXPLORER PET/CT: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_775238] 9   01/27/[ADDRESS_1064890] (UC Davis facility), on dedicated encrypted password-protected 
hard disks and workstations at UC Davis,  which project  staff may access ; in 
addition, electronic image files, radiation dose reports and pertinent medical information will be stored on the UC Davis radiology department PACS system, 
Radimetrics dose reporting system and Electronic Medical Record. These files will contain the patient identifiers. When this data is transferred for analysis to any other 
computer/device, it will be anonymized. W e will assign participants a unique 
subject/code number that will be used to identify them in our database. Our data will 
be in the form of anonymized images and coded medical records reported in an 
Excel spreadsheet and images in electronic format. The Excel spreadsheet and the 
images containing the subjects coded medical records will be stored in a encrypted 
password-protected device. We will keep the code key containing subject 
names/medical record numbers and corresponding subject code numbers in a 
secured location separate from the data. Only study team will have access to the data. Requests to use the data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], if approved, PI [INVESTIGATOR_775247]-identified data. Quality control will include regular data verification and protocol compliance checks by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_115292]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_775248]. 
 
9)  Data and/or Specimen Banking  
All the imaging data will be banked indefinitely for future use. Data will be 
saved on the EXPLORER research cluster at [ADDRESS_1064891] and/or on 
dedicated encrypted password-protected hard disks and workstations at UC Davis 
with access limited to authorized personnel. in addition, electronic image files, 
radiation dose reports and pertinent medical information will be stored on the UC Davis radiology department PACS system  and Electronic Medical Record. A 
radiation dose report will be generated. This will be part of the banked data and will 
contain Protected Health Information. It will be sent to Radimetric s system, which 
is a mandated tracking system for lifetime radiation dose. 
Future use of banked data may include improved image analysis, use as a 
normal atlas/comparator, and use for other research purposes.  
In addition, investigators from other entities may contact [CONTACT_775257]. Anonymous data may be shared with other entities if 
appropriate data use agreements are in place  (e.g., DTA and UC reliance) and if 
approved by [CONTACT_775258].  
Biological specimens (blood sample) are used only for screening purposes. 
Urine samples will be used for screening purposes and to assess radiotracer activity 
PROTOCOL TITLE: [ 1341792] EXPLORER PET/CT: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_775238] 9   01/27/2021 
Page 12 of 15   during scanning.  After the results are recorded the biological specimens will be 
discarded. 
10) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of S ubjects  
Throughout the study, study personnel will consult with the UC Davis Health 
Radiation Safety Officer and the local IRB regarding the monitoring and reporting 
of adverse events and follow their recommendations. Protocol changes involving the radiation dose will first receive approvals from Radiation Use Committee prior  
to submitting a modification request to the IRB. 
Participants will be informed about the study risks including risks related to 
iodine contrast media administration (Arm 3 only)  during the initial consenting and 
screening visit. In case a contrast reaction occurs, it  will be handled per departmental 
standard operating procedure.  
 Protocol changes will not be implemented prior to UC Davis IRB approval 
unless necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the research subjects.  
If any  incidental finding will be detected, they will be managed as described 
above in section “Procedures Involved” of this protocol. 
Data safety monitoring 
After acquisition of data, we will assign participants a unique subject/code 
number that we will use to identify them in the database used for processing, 
analysis, or publications. Our coded data will be in the form of elements of medical records recorded in an Excel spreadsheet saved in a encrypted password-protected 
device. Electronic image files, which may contain PHI, will be stored on the 
EXPLORER research cluster at [ADDRESS_1064892] and/or on dedicated 
encrypted password-protected hard disks and workstations at UC Davis. In addition, 
electronic image files, radiation dose reports and pertinent medical information will 
be stored on the UC Davis radiology department PACS system the Radimetrics dose 
reporting system and the Electronic Medical Record. Quality control will include 
regular data verification and protocol compliance checks by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_260541]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_775249]. 
 
Breach of confidentiality 
Confidentiality will be protected through periodic assessment, as new study 
materials and communication methods among project staff develop. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_102915]: [ 1341792] EXPLORER PET/CT: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_775238] 9   01/27/[ADDRESS_1064893] Reportable New 
Information form. 
11) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study without their consent if: 
• they do not follow the study rules or they  no longer meet the requirements to be in 
the study; or 
• the study is stopped by [CONTACT_115328]. 
• the investigators feel it is in the participants best interest to discontinue 
participation. Such circumstances may include unanticipated discomfort  and/or 
fatigue from laying on the scanner table, and feelings of claustrophobia from being inside the scanner bore.  
 
12) Risks to Subjects  
 
Risks to subjects may include: 
• Discomfort and/or fatigue from laying on the scanner table  
• Claustrophobic symptoms  
• Bruis ing and/or infection at the IV site  
• Radiation Risks:  This study involves a radiation exposure that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_775250]. The amount of  radiation 
exposure received in this study is below the levels that are thought to result in a significant risk of harmful effects.  
• It is possible that EXPLORER PET/CT may  detect  false p ositive findings 
that may require further follow -up (clinical, imaging or surgical) with all 
the risks associated with these follow- up procedures. These risks range 
from minor risks to severe risks including death and permanent diasabilities.  
• Hypoglycemia from prolonged fasting.  
Iodine contrast administration related risks ( only for Arm 3):   
 
Minor/Common risks: 
• Bruising and/or infection at IV site

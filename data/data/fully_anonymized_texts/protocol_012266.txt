Background, Rationale and Context  
Football has one of the highest rates of concussion among youth team sports.1,2 Although 
concussions are common in football, subconcussive head impacts, or repetitive head impacts without signs 
and symptoms of concussion, are a rising concern.3–[ADDRESS_1221200] begun to study characteristics of 
subconcussive head impacts.9–[ADDRESS_1221201] exposure (i.e., the frequency and 
magnitude of hits) resulting from participation in football (as well as other contact [CONTACT_874512]) may 
result in long term sequelae.3–8,12– [ADDRESS_1221202] exposure on the brain after a single season.15–[ADDRESS_1221203] failed 
to demonstrate a strong and consistent relationship between participation in football and cognitive change 
after a single season.33–[ADDRESS_1221204] and collision 
sports and later -life neurodegeneration or neurocognitive deficits is also not well -understood.3,4,39 –[ADDRESS_1221205] sensors to 
understand exposure and clinical implications of those impacts as to identify solutions to mitigate head 
impacts in sport.  
Youth football organizations often organize players into levels of play by [CONTACT_654], or by [CONTACT_874513]. 
Changes in body size (height and weight) and physical performance (speed, power, endurance) occur in 
parallel with adolescent participation in youth football, but can occur at different rates.45–47 It is thought 
that older athletes are faster, stronger and may play more aggressively than their younger counterparts.45,48 –
[ADDRESS_1221206] 
magnitude is often summarized by [CONTACT_874514]. A recent study of youth hockey players found that less aggressive players had significantly 
lower rotational accelerati ons than more aggressive players during practice.52 Lastly, underreporting of 
concussions has historically been a challenge.53,54 Improving knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs may 
improve reporting and perspectives related to concussion,55,56 and may also influence norms associated 
with high risk behaviors on -field. In this study, we will evaluate the feasibility and appropriateness of 
targeting individual -level determinants (e.g. knowledge, attitudes, beliefs) to reduce head impact exposure 
in youth football.  
The first study evaluating head impact exposure in youth football demonstrated that most high-
level impacts (> 80g) occur during practices, not games.57 This result led to rule changes implemented by 
[CONTACT_874515] (~9 -11% of youth football participants in the US), limiting how much contact (i.e., 
full-speed drills or scrimmages) a team has and eliminating full speed head -on blocking and tackling 
drills.[ADDRESS_1221207] in practices resulted in 37- 46% fewer head 
impacts in a season in a youth football team that implemented these rule changes versus two teams that did not;
59 however, this result has not been tested in other youth teams. Broglio et al. observed an average of 
42% fewer impacts per player following a statewide restriction on full -contact [CONTACT_874516].[ADDRESS_1221208] exposure – contact [CONTACT_874517], a finding later substantiated by 
[CONTACT_874518].[ADDRESS_1221209] exposure is associated with level of play (i.e., youth, high school); 
Protocol version: 
Template updated 9.24.[ADDRESS_1221210] exposure,64–68 and a 
recent study showed that incorporating targeted drills into a team’s practice resulted in improved tackling 
technique and reduced head impact exposure.[ADDRESS_1221211] not been applied to youth 
sports.70–[ADDRESS_1221212], create better communication, and improve health 
outcomes through action- oriented efforts.72,77,78 Community- level interventions address access to 
resources, the built (i.e., structure) and social (i.e., relationships within the community) environment, and 
cultural norms of a community.[ADDRESS_1221213] making successful interventions a lasting “legacy”.[ADDRESS_1221214] been documented.3–8,17,20,22– 24,28,32,81,[ADDRESS_1221215] and concussion risk; however, these rules are not informed by [CONTACT_874519]. 
Additionally, the most effective targets for reducing head impact exposure and concussion risk and how 
best to implement change in this setting is unknown. The objective  of this study is to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_874473]- based intervention to reduce head impact exposure in youth football practices using a 
community -engaged approach . We will seek to address the following specific aims:  
 
Aim 1:  Determine the awareness and receptivity to creating a safer practice structure to reduce head 
impact exposure in youth football among key stakeholders.  
Aim 2:  Develop an evidence- based intervention to reduce head impact exposure in youth football 
practices, using a community-engaged approach.  
Aim 3:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test the evidence- based practice structure to reduce head impact exposure and mitigate 
changes in clinical outcomes in youth football. 
 
We hypothesize  that (a) determinants at the individual (athlete), interpersonal (team & coach), and 
community levels (built & social environment) of the social ecological model
[ADDRESS_1221216] exposure in youth football practices, and (b) an evidence- based strategy to 
reduce head impact exposure in practices may be developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_874474] a community-engaged 
approach. (c) The reduction in exposure will be associated with a lower rate of change in pre- to post -season 
clinical outcome measures and cognitive function scores.

Methods and Measures  
 
Design  
Two local youth football teams at the middle school level (ages 1 1-14) will be recruited to 
participate in this study. Informed consent and signed assent forms will be obtained from 
parents/legal guardians of participating youth football players. All interested football players on 
the 2 teams will be enrolled; of those e nrolled, 15-20 per team (n=30-40 total) will be randomly 
selected for instrumentation with head impact sensors using a random numbers table. Head impact 
sensors embedded in a custom mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874475]- field video data for a season. These data will be used to inform guided 
discussions with stakeholders (parents, coaches, league officials). Using an audit and feedback approach (sharing biomechanical data with the stakeholders), we will facilitate semi -structured 
focus groups with the coaches (n=8) and parents (n=10) of the participating teams, and key informant interviews with league officials (n=8), to assess the awareness and receptiv ity to creating 
a safer practice structure. Participants will be asked to complete a series of cognitive, 
vestibular/ocular motor, and postural stability tasks pre - and post- season.  
 An anonymous survey concerning knowledge, attitudes, and practices as well as the perceived 
needs, perceived benefits, capacity, and barriers to implementing efforts to improve head impact 
safety will be created and sent to coaches, parents, and league officials (n=153). Data will be combined with published literature to inform the development of an evidence -based intervention 
using a community-engaged approach. At the end of year 3, two youth football teams at the middle school level will be recruited to pi[INVESTIGATOR_874476]. The football 
coaches of each team will be prospectively recruited and enrolled. Informed consent will be 
obtained from adults (coaches and parents/legal guardians of youth athletes) and parents/legal guardians of all participating youth athletes will sign assent forms. Again, all interested athletes on 
these teams will be enrolled; of those enroll ed, 15-20 per team (n=30-40 total) will be randomly 
selected for instrumentation with head impact sensors using a random numbers table. Athletes will also complete the series of cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, and postural stability tasks pre - and 
post-season. On-field activity, skills, and behaviors will be monitored with head impact sensor s 
and on- field video data to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention at reducing head impact 
exposure and the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of the intervention.  The results will be 
disseminated to the youth football league at the end of t he study.  
 
Setting  
Biomechanical data collection will occur during  yout h football practices and games. Stakeholder 
meetings and key informant interviews will be conducted at the local elementary school, community centers, and Biotech Place in Winston Salem, NC. Clinical outcome data collection and 
data analysis will be conduc ted at the WFU Center for Injury Biomechanics, a research lab located 
at Biotech Place. Additionally, we plan to recruit individuals across the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_874477] 2024 data collection. 
 
Subjects selection criteria  
• Inclusion Criteria  
Mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874478]:  
All athletes participating on the prospective teams will be eligible for the stud y, including those 
with braces longer than 6 months.  
 
Protocol version: 
Template updated 9.24.14 4 Focus Groups, Key Informant Interviews:  
All parents with athletes participating on the prospective teams and coaches of the prospective 
teams will be eligible for participation in the study.  All league officials of the governing 
organization will be eligible for participation in the study.  
 Surveys:  
All parents, coaches, and league officials of the governing youth football organization will be 
eligible for participation in the survey portion of the study.  
 
• Exclusion Criteria  
Mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874478]:  
Athletes will be excluded from participation if they have had braces less than [ADDRESS_1221217] dental appliances that may impede the fit of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_527057] (e.g., Herbst Appliance).   
 
• Sample Size  
Study Sample - Athletes : Each year of  the study, w e will identify two middle school (ages 1 1-
14) football teams for this study. All interested athletes on these teams will be invited to voluntarily participate in biomechanical data collection; of those enrolled, [ADDRESS_1221218] sensors. Informed consent will be 
obtained from parents/legal guardians of all athletes; participating athletes will sign assent 
forms. The number of athletes (N=30- 40 each year, N= 105-130 total) was chosen based on our 
earlier studies, which reported significant differences in exposures among football conditions 
with sample sizes of 9
85, 4086 and 3087. We aim to accrue sufficient information to assess 
relationships (e.g. between measures of exposures) and describe variability among exposure 
levels among conditions and athletes. N=30 provides >80% power to detect correlations of 
r>=0. 50, i.e. associations of sufficient strength to inform design of the intervention (Aim 3). It 
also provides sufficient precision for estimating standard deviations: 90% confidence intervals 
will range from 0.83 to 1.28 SD units. Additionally, a Fall 2022 football cohort (N=14) from 
Head Kinematics in Sports Study ( IRB00049715) will be included in biomechanics data 
collection and analysis. In Fall 2024, we plan to enroll (n=55) athletes across two of six 
partic ipating teams to participate in parallel biomechanical and video data collection to evaluate 
the frequency and severity of head impacts experienced throughout the season. 
 
Study Sample - Stakeholders:  Coaches and parents of the participating teams will be recruited 
to participate in separate focus groups —two for coaches and two for parents. League officials 
will be prospectively recruited to participate in key informant interviews. Informed consent 
will be obtained from stakeholders. Each team has one head coach and three to five assistant 
coaches and approximately 20 athletes. The number of parents (n= 40) and coaches (n= 35) 
enrolled in the focus group portion of this study w as selected based on the estimated number 
of athletes (and thus number of parents) and coaches involved with each football team. We expect to recruit 25% of the parents and 100% of the coaches participating on each team. Only one parent per family will be asked to participate to increase the number of families able to 
participate in discussions. We expect to enroll one -third (n=8) of league officials to participate 
in key informant interviews.  
 
Study Sample - Surveys:  An anonymous survey (7- 10 minutes) will be created and sent via 
email listserv to coaches, parents, and league officials of the local youth football league at the start of the fall football season T here are ~ 150 football coaches of 51 football teams 
participating in one of 12 organizations, with ~ 800 families, and 24 league officials. To obtain 
a representative sample, we will seek a sample size of N=25 coaches (16.7%), N=120 parents 
(15%), and N= 8 league officials (33%).

Interventions and Interactions  
 
Biomechanics Data Collection:  
We will conduct biomechanical data collection from athletes participating on local youth football 
teams. A  custom mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874479]. The custom 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874480], which is a commonly used biocompatible material used to 
make dental retainers. An accelerometer, gyroscope, inductive chargi ng coil, processor, and 
batteries are embedded in the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. The mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874481] a soft mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874482]. Data from 
accelerometer and gyroscopes are stored in the device and downloaded after a data collection event. Each athlete will be custom fit to a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874483] (TRIOS, Copenhagen, 
Denmark) of the upper dentition by a trained dental technician. The scan obtains a high- resolution 
3-D model used for printing using a Carbon M1 3D printer with Continuous Light Interphase 
Production. The dental scan is a resolution three- dimensional pi[INVESTIGATOR_874484] 2D pi[INVESTIGATOR_874485].  The scan takes approximately [ADDRESS_1221219] or by a dental technician / hygienist 
overseen by a dentist. The 3 -D printed model is used to create the custom mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874486]. 
 
The mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874487]. The mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874488]. The distribution and colle ction of the sensor system with mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874489]. The mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874490] a sanitary 
manner such that  contamination between athlete mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874491].  
 The custom mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874492]. These devices are observational devices. The risks of wearing the 
instrumented mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874493] (3.7V, 30mAh) and 
all electronics and battery will be encapsulated in medical -grade acrylic as a moisture and dielectric 
barrier. Collaborating researchers at Wake Forest and Virginia Tech have performed pi[INVESTIGATOR_874494] (IRB) with this device and none of the athletes have reported adverse events from wearing the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874495].  
 The mouthguard form of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874496] -grade acylic and elastomer polymer 
mouthguard material (ethylene vinyl acetate). The acrylic and mouthguard material are held together with a form of super glue (ethyl cyanoacrylate). These type of m aterials have been used in 
dental applications and preliminary evidence suggests that they are safe for intraoral use [or for use 
within the mouth].   
 
The Prevent mouthguard is made of USP Class VI (m edical grade) or FDA food grade 
thermoplastic mouthguard material (polyurethane and ethylene vinyl acetate ). The iMG complies 
with CE requirements and FCC regulations for wireless communication. These type of materials 
have been used in dental applications and preliminary evidence suggests that they are safe for intraoral use [or for use within the mouth].   
 
Another team we will follow  in the Fall 2024 season will wear a helmet sensor. The sensor measures 
the motion of his/her head when your child has been hit. The CUE Sport Sensor is a helmet or headband wearable sensing technology designed to collect key data on the hea d-impacts our 
athletes sustain. When paired with the  Athlete Intelligence system, they  analyze on -field head -

purpose of this study. Videotapes, audiotapes, and/or photographs will be used for presentation purposes and/or for visualization of a specific impact or play to guide focus group discussions.  The 
context of the events leading up to and the events following an impact may be relevant to the 
study. In any use of this photograph/videotape/audiotape, the subjects name [CONTACT_874543]. 
To protect individ uals further, individual’s impacts will not be discussed during focus group 
meetings but rather summary statistics represented a collection of events measured by [CONTACT_874520][INVESTIGATOR_6928]. During the consent process, the athletes and parents will be made clear that the 
biomechanical data and matched video collected in this study will be used to guide focus group discussions.  
 Stakeholder Survey:  
An anonymous survey will be sent via email listserv to coaches, parents, and league officials of the 
local youth football league at the start of the fall football season. Survey questions will be derived 
from previously published surveys and guided by [CONTACT_874521] a published health behavior model. 
Where appropriate, responses will be made optional. A cover letter will state that completion of the survey indicates consent to participate. Parents will only complete the survey once, even if they 
have multiple children participating in football. League officials and coaches will also be asked to 
complete an additional survey (Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC)). An 
anonymous survey will be sent via email listserv to coaches of local youth football leagues and high schools. Survey questions will be derived from previously published surveys.  Data collection will be open one month prior to and during the  first month of the football season. We will work 
with the league to reach as many respond ents as possible. To encourage participation, those who 
complete the survey within the first month of the season will be entered into a raffle to win one of 
three $50 gift cards.  Email address will be stored separate from the survey response only for the 
purpose of notifyi ng of the raffle result in order to maintain anonymity of survey responses.  
 
Focus Groups:  
During the football season, coaches (n=8, 4 from each team) and parents (n=10, 5 from each team) 
of the enrolled teams will be invited to participate in separate 60 -minute focus groups (two for 
coaches, two for parents) monthly (Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov), using  an audit and feedback approach. 
At the first (Aug) and last meeting (Nov), coaches and parents will complete the stakeholder survey (Appendix 2). Coaches will also complete a 10 -question survey assessing how often the coaches 
include specific drills in th eir practice structure and the perceived frequency and magnitude of hits 
experienced in five common youth football drills: Install, Oklahoma, One -on-One, Open Field 
Tackling, and Position Skill Work. Sample questions include: “On a scale of [ADDRESS_1221221] 
hit an athlete may receive in a game?” At each focus group meeting, printed weekly practice and game reports will be handed out to each participant. During the first 20 minutes, a summary 
presentation of the practice and game reports, including video examples of drills conducted in the 
prior month and the associated biomechanical data measured from the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_874497] a PowerPoint presentation. Thirty minutes will be reserved 
for a semi -structured group interview to discuss what was seen in the video and implications of the 
data on practice structure in youth football and coaching. Trained focus group l eaders will lead 
Protocol version: 
Template updated 9.24.14 7 discussion guided by a series of questions and prompts. As the season progresses, questions and 
prompts may be added to the focus group guide as new topi[INVESTIGATOR_874498]. League officials (n=8) will be recruited to participate in pre -season (Aug) 
and post -season (Nov) key informant interviews following the same format as the focus groups. 
Study staff will take notes and collect audio recordings of the discussions. During the last 10 
minutes of each focus group meeting and key informant interview, the stakeholders will complete an 8- item scale on the a cceptability and feasibility of creating a safer practice structure using the 
validated Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) and Feasibility of Intervention Measure 
(FIM).
88 This survey will be repeated at each meeting to determine changes in perceived feasibility 
and acceptability over time.  
 
In Fall 2024, Coaches (n=24) and parents (n=30) will be invited to participate in separate, team -
specific 60 -minute focus groups (six for coaches, six for parents) at pre -season and post -season 
timepoints to assess domains of the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model 
(PRISM)89 implementation framework, including organizational needs, capacity, and readiness to 
adopt the intervention program. We will augment PRISM with the Interactive Systems Framework (ISF)
90 community factor domain to additionally understand how the community may influence 
capacity and readiness. Trained focus group leaders will lead discussion guided by a series of 
questions and prompts. Organizational leaders (n=12) will be recruited to participate in a key 
informant interview following the same format as the focus groups. Study staff will take notes and 
collect audio recordings of the discussions. The questions and prompts will remain the same across 
the two meetings to measure changes in p erspectives over the course of the season; however, 
questions and prompts may be added to the second discussion as new topi[INVESTIGATOR_874499]/interviews. During the last 5 minutes of each focus group 
meeting and inte rview, the stakeholders will complete an 8 -item scale on the acceptability and 
feasibility of the intervention program using the validated AIM and FIM surveys.  
 
Identifying Adaptations. W e will convene our community stakeholder team (n=12) to participate 
in monthly meetings (January – March  2025) to review intervention outcomes and assess program 
fit and necessary adaptations to address organizational capacity and readiness to adopt the 
intervention program. Guided by [CONTACT_874522][INVESTIGATOR_139484], the intervention program will 
be refined acco rdingly, while maintaining essential elements of the intervention program. The 
stakeholder team consists of youth and high school football coaches, league and school administrators, parents, an athletic trainer, and a director of player development for a local university. We have successful relationships with and support from our community stakeholder 
team. During the development phase, we had >90% engagement attendance in meetings; 75% of 
the original stakeholder team has remained engaged through the evaluation phase of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_48266]. We will add additional stakeholders from the Charlotte metropolitan region to strengthen the diversity and expertise within our team. A written summary will be provided after each meeting documenting discussion a nd progress.   
 Within the focus groups and league official interviews, stakeholders will be aware of other 
stakeholders included in group discussions; however, their identity within the youth football league will remain anonymous. Participants will be informed before the focus group and interviews if the session will be audio  or video recorded as well as what will be done with the recordings. Audio or 
video recordings will only be used for data analysis. Because of the nature of focus groups, confidentiality cannot be guaranteed; however, the research team will provide procedures to 
maintain confidentiality and will inform participants not to repeat what is said in the focus groups.   
 
Stakeholder Engagement:  
Protocol version: 
Template updated 9.24.14 8 Stakeholders will be identified (n=12) and gathered for a presentation of the research findings and 
round table discussion of needs, concerns, and implications of research findings using a community 
engaged approach. Possible local stakeholders (n=8) include league officials, coaches, athletes, and 
parents, representing different levels of interest and influence. To increase generalizability, four 
stakeholders external to the local football league will be identified, including two high school 
football coach es and two Forsyth County school administrators. Stakeholder involvement will be 
voluntary and informed consent will be provided prior to the stakeholder discussions. Stakeholders 
will be aware of other stakeholders included in group discussions; however, their identity within 
the youth football league will remain anonymous.  
 
Together with the stakeholders, [CONTACT_729594]  will conduct monthly stakeholder meetings to develop 
an intervention focused on reducing head impact exposure in practice. During the first meeting, 
stakeholders will be gathered for a presentation of research findings, including identified high- risk 
activities and skills and results from focus groups, interviews, and surveys, and discussion of needs, concerns, and implications of the research using a community -engaged approach. We will conduct 
Intervention Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_874500], develop, refine, and 
select a strategy to test for reducing head impact exposure in practices.
91 This will include 
specifying an action- oriented objective and clearly defining which determinants and level(s) of the 
social -ecological model will be targeted. Together, we will brainstorm possible methods to achieve 
the defined objectives. The research team will evaluate the level of evidence to support the proposed 
methods and work with the stakeholders group to translate proposed methods into strategies. 
Strategies will be developed and compi[INVESTIGATOR_874501](s) of the social ecologica l 
model and program objectives. The strategy selected for pi[INVESTIGATOR_874502], alignment with needs of the community, 
feasibility, acceptability, availability of resources (i.e., coaching staff, tackling dummies), and 
amount of evidence to support the strategy. Acceptability will be a priority when selecting the 
strategy as guided by [CONTACT_874523], which will be used to 
develop the implementation plan.[ADDRESS_1221222] priority in the 
development and testing of the intervention.   
We will work with the stakeholders to develop an implementation plan. The implementation plan will define characteristics of the intervention, timeline and degrees of involvement, resources and 
training materials, and a specific action plan. The Conceptual  Model of Implementation Research 
will guide selection of the strategy/practice structure and development of the implementation 
plan.
92 In this model, effective implementation is a function of the organization’s readiness for 
change; resources available for implementation (i.e., training and technical support); support from 
the organization’s leadership; presence of a champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]; extent to which the practice structure fits the needs of those affected and involved in youth football practices; and extent to which 
stakeholders perceive the practice structure reflects their values. We will continually solicit input 
and feedback from stakeholders  on the objectives, guidelines, resources, and evaluation criteria for 
the practice structure and strategies for effective implementation. Essential elements of 
implementation will be defined
93 (e.g., minutes per practice spent on specified activities, number 
of practices per week the coach followed the practice structure).  
 
An additional 10 adult stakeholders in the youth football community will be engaged via interviews 
to provide feedback on the intervention program for future program development.  
 
 
Protocol version: 
Template updated 9.24.14 9  
Intervention:  
Before the fall football season (June -July), we will recruit coaches and athletes teams at the middle 
school level to pi[INVESTIGATOR_874503]- field activity 
with head impact sensors to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of the practice 
structure.  Coaches of the teams enrolled in the intervention will be trained according to guidelines 
established in the intervention development  by a trained football advisor (e.g., a former college 
footba ll player), who will be a resource throughout the season. During the season (Aug-Nov), 
trained research staff will attend all practices and games to collect biomechanical data and video 
during each session. Implementation process (i.e., feasibility and pot ential utility of the 
implementation strategy) will be monitored. Stakeholders will be gathered intermittently (at most 
monthly) to provide feedback on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, including 
suggestions to improve uptake of the practi ce structure, if needed, and to identify implementation 
process strengths.  
 Fifteen athletes recruited from each intervention team will be assigned an instrumented mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] . 
All data will be screened to remove impacts that did not occur from a head impact. Video will be reviewed to characterize on -field activity and paired with the head impact sensor data and to 
determine the extent to which the intervention was implemented. Coaches will complete the 8- item 
scale assessing the acceptability and feasibility of creating a safer practice structure using the AIM 
and FIM (Appendix 2) at the start and end of the season.
88 Stakeholders will complete the surveys 
at each monthly stakeholder meeting . 
 
Intervention Summary: 
The intervention will seek to reduce head impacts in youth football by (1) improving the knowledge 
and skills of youth football coaches in effective practice planning and use of safe practice drills and 
(2) changing attitudes and beliefs towards contact [CONTACT_874524]. The activities of the intervention are aligned with constructs of Social Cognitive Theory
94 and Diffusion of Innovation95 and are as 
follows:  
1. A pre-season educational clinic  will be provided to youth football coaches. The 
educational clinic will include a panel discussion of high school football coaches around the topic of practice planning, presentations from medical and research 
professionals on head impact biomechanics and  related sports medicine topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (e.g., 
concussion signs and symptoms, cardiovascular emergencies, heat precautions), and 
demonstrations of safe practice drills.  
2.  Coaches will be asked to follow guided practice plans that follow the 
[NO_PRINTED_FORM] National Federation for High Schools (NFHS)[ADDRESS_1221223]: Air, Bags, Cont rol, 
Thud/Bump, and Live contact. Three practice plans will be created that designate a full contact [CONTACT_14603], moderate contact [CONTACT_14603] (no drills in the Live category), and limited 
contact [CONTACT_14603] (no drills in the Live category). 
3. Coaches will be provided a reference booklet  with drill explanations, guidance on 
practice planning and drill selection, and frequently asked questions. The drills for the reference booklet will be gathered from local high school football coaches with 
knowledge of the NCHSAA handbook and safe practi ces in football.  
4. The intervention coaches will be paired with high school football coach/coaching staff who will serve as a trained football advisor  and peer mentor. The intervention coaches 
will be asked to meet with their peer mentor weekly throughout the season to provide 
guidance on practice planning throughout the season.

surveys will be repeated at each meeting to determine changes in perceived acceptability and 
feasibility over time.  
 
Neurocognitive Assessments:  
Enrolled athletes may complete a series of clinical outcome assessments pre- and post -season, 
including measures of neurocognition, postural control, and vestibular/ocular motor symptoms. The parent and child versions of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) 
Monitoring Form
99,100 and Revised Child Anxiety & Depression Scale (RCADS)[ADDRESS_1221225] -study assessments to monitor behavior and mood changes. The elements 
of the clinical outcome assessments are described below:  
 
ImPACT:    
For this study, the web- based version of the ImPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion 
Assessment and Cognitive Testing) will be given to athletes after diagnosis of a concussion.  Administration of the test will be monitored by a member of the study staff member trained in the application of the ImPACT test.  The ImPACT test takes 
approximately 20 minutes to complete.    
NIH Toolbox:   
The NIH Toolbox is a multidimensional set of brief measures assessing cognitive, 
emotional, motor and sensory function from ages [ADDRESS_1221226] set 
of measures that can be used as a “common currency” across diverse study designs, 
including repeated measures designs, such as the present study.  Specifically, we will use 
the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery which is administered on an iPAD.  The cognition battery consists of tests to assess Executive Function, Attention, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_17120], 
Language, Processing Speed and Working Memory.  Administering this battery will yield 
summary scores (i.e., Cognitive Function Composite Score and Crystallized Cognition Composite Score), as well as individual measure scores.   
 Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT):  
The RAVLT assesses verbal learning ability and memory; in this study, only learning ability is evaluated (4 minutes).  A series of 15 words is presented to the participant 3 times via audio recording for standardization, and answers are recorded.   
 
Stationary Postural Control/Force Plate:   
Consistent with the methodology outlined by [CONTACT_874525]., participants will 
complete two 30 -second trials (one with eyes opened, one with eyes closed).
102 Five 
measurements will be calculated at each time point (pre- and post -season): anterior -
Protocol version: 
Template updated 9.24.[ADDRESS_1221227], path length, maximum path velocity, and center of 
pressure area.  
 
Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS):  
The participant will be asked to complete a series of rapid head movements to assess five 
domains: smooth pursuit, saccades, near point convergence, vestibular ocular reflex, and visual motion sensitivity. Symptom provocation will be assessed by a trained member of 
the study team. Near point convergence will be averaged across three trials.  
 
Conners’ Continuous Performance Test (CPT) Third Edition (CPT- 3):  
Participants will complete a 14 -minute computer -based assessment that evaluates selective, 
sustained and divided attention, as well as impulsivity and vigilance. 
 
Triggers for Testing:   
Triggers refer to the standards an athletic trainer or coach will use to determine whether or not an 
impacted player s hould receive further testing. The triggers for testing will be the standard already 
used by [CONTACT_874526]. If a concussion is suspected, 
the athletic trainers typi[INVESTIGATOR_874504] [ADDRESS_1221228]-Injury Testing:   
Post-injury testing is any testing that is administered after a player has been diagnosed by a team 
physician or athletic trainer to have a concussion. The records for Post -Injury Testing will only be 
provided and used for research analysis AFTER a concussion has been diagnosed, pending signed 
authorization by [CONTACT_874527]. No additional or different testing will be done because of a player’s participation in the study. 
 
Post-injury testing will include baseline cognitive, postural control,  and vestibular/ocular motor 
testing  within 24-48 hours after concussion diagnosis.  
 
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
• Primary Outcomes:  
o Number of head impacts, impact rate  
o Mean and 95th percentile number of impacts, linear acceleration, rotational acceleration by 
[CONTACT_413972], activity, skill and behavior 
o Pre- to Post -Season change scores for:  
 ImPACT  
 NIH Toolbox 
 RAVLT  
 Postural Control 
 VOMS  
 Conners’ CPT 
• Secondary Outcomes:  
o Implementation facilitators and barriers  
o Intervention fidelity  
o Adaptation of the intervention 
 
Protocol version: 
Template updated 9.24.[ADDRESS_1221229] data 
will be transformed to the head center of gravity using Matlab (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) and 
quantified for each session (i.e., practice or game) and practice drill category (i.e., conditioning, tackling) 
and across drill types (i.e., Oklahoma, one -on-one) in terms of mean number of impacts and impact rate 
and mean and 95th percentile head acceleration.  
 Descriptive statistics will be computed from survey responses using SAS. Field notes and recordings from 
focus meetings will be reviewed by [CONTACT_874528], issues, and concepts and a thematic framework will be created surrounding the awareness and 
receptivity of the stakeholders to create a safer practice structure.
103 Data will be indexed, charted, and 
mapped using a schematic diagram to guide interpretation of the results. Survey questions and responses 
will be grouped according to the thematic framework. Perceived feasibility (FIM), acceptability (AIM), and 
stakehold er survey constructs measured at the initial meeting (Aug) will be compared to the final meeting 
(Nov).   
We will use established qualitative methods
104,[ADDRESS_1221230] 
rates and percentiles (i.e., 50th, 95th) computed from the distribution of accelerations will be compared 
between unexposed (year 2, published iTAKL and BRP study data61,106– 108) and exposed seasons of data 
collection. Mixed -effects models (in SAS) will be used to assess differences in head impact exposure in 
practices and games before (year 2 , published iTAKL and BRP study data61,106– 108) and after the 
intervention, adjusting for confounding factors, including team. We will examine the consistency of 
intervention effects on exposure outcomes between teams and among players over time, with the goal of learning how to refine and tailor the intervention to increase adherence and potential effectiveness. Because 
this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will lack sufficient power to fully test the effectiveness of the intervention; however, we will gather essential information for a future R01-supported randomized control trial.  
 
All clinical assessment scores will be compared to same age peers at testing time (via published normative values) to control for developmental changes that may occur during the study period. Scores will be 
normalized (i.e. z -scores) to facilitate comparis ons among cognitive tests. Kinematic metrics (i.e., total 
impacts, 95
th percentile accelerations and rotational velocity, RWE) will be time -varying covariates in 
generalized linear and mixed effects models. The modeling framework, with its random effects structure, 
will allow for assessment of clinical outcome  differences pre - to post -season over time between the 
intervention athletes and controls. We will also describe whether associations may vary according to 
athletes’ characteristics.  
 
Protocol version: 
Template updated 9.24.14 13 Descriptive data and inferential statistics related to implementation facilitators and barriers (i.e., feasibility, 
acceptability), fidelity (i.e., extent to which the intervention was implemented as prescribed), and adaptation 
(i.e., changes) of the inter vention will be analyzed. These data will be abstracted from standardized forms 
collected during on- field observations, video- analysis of practices and games, and brief surveys and field 
notes from stakeholder feedback meetings .[ADDRESS_1221231] in participating in the study. All interested athletes on th ese teams 
will be allowed to participate; of those enrolled, [ADDRESS_1221232] udy using similar 
recruitment strategies as the controls. Informed consent will be obtained from adults (coaches, parents, and 
league officials) and parents/legal guardians of all youth athletes and participating athletes will sign consent 
and assent forms.  
 To maintain a robust cohort of subjects, we will enroll all interested subjects from each team for possible 
participation in the study and randomly choose 15 per team for study at the start of the season. Participation 
will be monitored weekly; if an athlete has attended 50% or less of the practices or games within a [ADDRESS_1221233] who enrolled prior to the start of the season will be randomly chosen for biomechanical data 
collection and given a sensor. We anticipate a possible attrition rate of 15%  based on experience from our 
existing R01s. To ensure that sufficient participants are included, we will work closely with the local youth 
football league to identify and engage additional teams, if needed. 
 
To reward all subjects for attending appointments to complete baseline, post- injury, and post -season 
evaluation procedures during the contact [CONTACT_874529], a gift card will be awarded, at all appointments, for the subject’s additional travel and time to attend the procedures.  See the table below for gift card

Informed Consent  
 
Signed informed consent will be obtained from each subject.  [CONTACT_729594] and trained study personnel will 
work with the league executive board to arrange meetings for coaches, parents, and players to describe the 
study and provide opportunities to answer questions. She and trained study personnel will also attend pre-
season conditioning sessions to meet with parents, coaches, and athletes not present at the meetings. Those 
not present at the meetings or pre -season conditioning sessions will be sought out individually by [CONTACT_874531]. 
 
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject by [CONTACT_874532]. The informed consent form will 
be presented in individual meetings to eac h prospective participant in detail. Players, parents, and coaches 
will be encouraged to ask questions and will be given the opportunity to have all questions answered. The 
prospective participants will be told their participation is completely voluntary a nd they will not be 
pressured into participation. During the consent process, the study staff will work to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. It is estimated that the individual consent process will take 
approximately [ADDRESS_1221235] of the team to avoid the potential 
for peer pressure.

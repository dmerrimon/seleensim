Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
In foot and ankle surgery, the prevention of postoperative hematoma in a confined 
space in the wound has a crucial impact on periop erative outcomes.  Th ere has been 
growing emphasis on the role of antifibrinolytics to minimize bleeding and the 
formation of postoperative hematoma .  Approximately 20% of all foot and ankle 
fractures are open. Excellent operative field without measurable bleeding remain 
prerequisite of most orthopedic procedures. Increase blood loss can increase the risk 
of infection, hematoma formation and wound complications. Presence of blood in 
synovium not only has direct corrosive effects but also causes increased in tra 
capsular pressure leading to capsular fibrosis culminating as ankyloses.  
                
Traditionally, t ourniquets are employed to optimize surgical field visualization 
thereby [CONTACT_219718]. There are 
several unwanted effects that can arise from  use of tourniquet like neurapr axia,  
vascular injury,  post operative swelling etc. Hence there is a growing interest in 
achieving the same operative goals  without the use of tourniquet.  
 
Antifibrinolytics can be utilized  to achieve a blood sparing effect. Its efficacy in 
reducing intra operative and post operative blood loss is well documented in cardiac 
surgery,  joint replacement surgery , and spin e surgery. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic 
antifibrinolytic drug tha t competitively blocks the lysine -binding sites of 
plasminogen, plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator, thereby [CONTACT_219719]:  EFFICACY OF TRANEXAMIC ACID IN FOOT AND ANKLE

IV administration  lasts 8-[ADDRESS_264000] 
incorporated TXA into multiple elective surgeries as a means of reducing blood loss 
and transfusion requirements.  
 
Effectiveness o f Tranexamic acid  (TXA) in postoperative outcomes is unknown in 
foot and ankle surgeries. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of 
intraoperative doses of intravenous TXA in reducing post operative bleeding and 
hematoma formation  after foot and  ankle surgeries.  
 
 
1)Objectives  
Research Question : Does intraoperative administration  of intravenous TXA reduc e 
postoperative bleeding and hematoma formation after foot and ankle surgeries ? 
Primary outcome: The incidence of wound complications classified  as dehiscence, 
hematoma, necrosis and infection.  Wound healing time and length of stay will be 
evaluated.  The first follow up at surgeon’s office will be included.  
Secondary outcome:  The amount of intra operative and post operative blood loss 
during th e first [ADDRESS_264001] -
operative complete blood count (CBC), duration of surgery and intra operative fluid 
resuscitation will be recorded. Intraoperative and post operative narcotic 
consumption.  
 
2)Background  
See above.  Effectiveness of Tranexamic acid ( TXA) is u nknown in foot and ankle 
surgeries. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of intravenous TXA in 
reducing post operative blood  loss during foot and ankle surgeries.

4)Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research  
For n=200 , the feasibility of recruitment i s manageable. Recruitment will be done 
through a coordination of the operating schedule and the surgeon’s office.  Patients 
prese nting for preoperative visits at  the surgeon ’s office or the preoperative joint 
clinic will be approached. The surgeon will als o provide study information 
(protocol, consent, general information) to patients in the surgeon’s office.  After 
confirmation on the operating schedule, patients will be provided detailed 
instructions the day before surgery and the final consent will be obtained  at the 
surgeon’s  office or joint clinic for  patients at Mount Sinai West hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . On the day 
of the surgery, the subject will meet the research team in the holding area.  The team 
will finalize participation and ask the subject about the signed con sent forms and 
answer any additional questions.   The staff members on this protocol are all 
employees of Mount Sinai and will either be a resident or attending physicians that 
are included on  the IRB protocol. There are three  primary members of the resear ch 
personnel:  
     a)Yan Lai, MD, MPH – Roles for [CONTACT_116070] in this study include serving as primary 
investigator responsible for study design and planning, data collection, subject 
recruitment, manuscript writing and preparation, data analysis, safety monit oring, 
and responding to adverse events and/or complications. He is certified in PPHS/IRB 
protocols, all Citi/IRB required training in human subject protection, and has prior 
clinical research experience. He is also a board certified anesthesiologist and 
assistant professor of anesthesiology with the Icahn School of Medicine and the 
Mount Sinai Health System.

There a re institutional processes to ensure that all persons assisting with the protocol 
will be  well informed.  The research personnel will conduct regular meetings and 
department email updates to review the results and safety data of the study.   The 
research pe rsonnel will initiate the formation of a safety monitoring board for 
adverse effects, complications, or complaints from patient subjects.  
 
  5) Study  Design  
Prospective triple blinded randomized control trial . The surgeon will also provide 
study informatio n (protocol, consent, general information) to patients in the 
surgeon’s office.   Recruitment will be done through a coordination of the operating 
schedule and the surgeon’s office.  Patients presenting for preoperative visits at the 
surgeon’s office or th e preoperative joint clinic will be approached. On the day of 
the surgery, the subject will meet the research team in the holding area.  The team 
will finalize participation and ask the subject about the signed consent forms and

j) Withdrawal of Subjects  
 Patients may withdraw from the study at any given time by [CONTACT_116063]. Data will not be collected on patients who wish to 
withdraw. Patient s do not need to withdraw consent in writing.  
 
6) Risks to Subjects  
If patients are injured or made sick from taking part in this research study, medical 
care will be provided. Generally, this care will be billed to the patient or their 
insurance in the ordinary manner and the patient will be responsible for all treatment 
costs not covered insurance, including ded uctibles, co -payments and coinsurance.   
This does not prevent the patient from seeking payment for injury related to 
malpractice or negligence. Contact [CONTACT_219723].  
 
As with any medication, there is a possibility of an allergic re action. Although rare, 
possible co mplications include  hypersensitivity reaction, bleeding or local site

outcome.   
 
9)Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Patients will be appropriately educated about the research study. Any questions or 
concerns they have will be adequately addressed and patients will have th e option to 
decline participation. Patients will be given as much time as they need to review the 
consent form. The study personnel will be approaching the subjects. Privacy will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_116065].  
The identities of human subjects whose data is bei ng studied  will be de -identified as 
per HIPAA Privacy Rule.  
 
10)Economic Impact on Subjects  
Patients will not incur any additional cost for participating in the study. The

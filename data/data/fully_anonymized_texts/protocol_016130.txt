 Protocol Body  
1.0 Objectives  
Primary endpoint : 
To establish the safety of this treatment by [CONTACT_346556] -related mortality 
(TRM) within 30 days.  
 
Secondary endpoints : 
To estimate the relapse -free survival (RFS). 
To estimate the overall survival (OS).  
To quantify duration of infused allogeneic UCB -derived NK cells in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
2.0 Background  
High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem -cell transplant (ASCT) is an 
established treatment for relapsed B lymphomas. The antitumor effect of ASCT results 
from the cytotoxic effect of HDC. Although ASCT is clearly safe (TRM <5%), tumor 
relapse constitutes a major cause of treatment failure. For example, the recent Coral 
trial in modern diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients who relapse after 1st 
line therapy with R -CHOP shows that up to 80% of patients who subsequently respond 
to salvage therapy and are thus become candidates to ASCT will still relapse after 
transp lant.[1] Ways to improve ASCT results include the improvement of the efficacy of 
the HDC regimen, as well as the combination of HDC with immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_346539].  
 
Natural  killer (NK) cells are part of the innate  immune  system  and have  been  implicated 
in tumor immunity and defense.[2] Importantly, NK cells do not require prior exposure 
or sensitization to kill a  specific  target.  While the exact mechanism of NK  cells 
anti-tumor immunity remains unclear, a complex interplay between activat ing and 
inhibitory receptors determines cytotoxicity against a specific target.[3] This includes 
possible disinhibition of the killer immunoglobulin like receptor due to absence of HLA 
class I molecules on target cells ("missing self hypothesis"), as well as death  
receptor -induced apoptosis via Fas ligand and TNF -related apoptosis -inducing ligand 
(TRAIL).[4]  
 
Robust NK reconstitution has been associated with improved outcomes for non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma after AHSCT.[5, 6, 7]. Unfortunately, autologous NK cells  from patients with 
lymphoma appear to be dysfunctional, due to, among other causes, an unfavorable 
balance between activating and inhibitory receptors.[8, 9] While immunomodulatory 
drugs, such as lenalidomide, or cytokines, such as IL -12, may augment NK c ell function 
after ASCT,[10] clinical experience has shown that this is not sufficient to prevent 
disease progression. Therefore, successful NK immunotherapy activity against 
lymphoma probably requires an allogeneic source. Because of these limitations of 
autologous NK cell function, we have been interested in the application of allogeneic NK 
cells as an adoptive cellular therapy to treat patients receiving an ASCT.  
 
The clinical safety of peripheral blood -derived allogeneic NK cell infusions has been  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 4 of 26 
 demonstrated.[11, 12] This requires collection of peripheral blood from a normal donor 
to generate NK cells, which can be logistically cumbersome.  To minimize obstacles to 
collection we have been interested in NK cells derived from cryopreserved umbilical 
cord blood (CB), a known source of hematopoietic progenitor cells and an “off -the-shelf” 
product. Our group has previously published a good manufa cturing production  
(GMP) -grade method of NK cell expansion from thawed CB mononuclear cells based 
on artificial antigen -presenting cells (Fig. 1). This method yields a >1000 -fold expansion 
of NK cells with in vitro and in vivo antitumor  activity.[13]  
 
 
Fig. 1. GMP -compliant method of expansion of CB NK cells.  
 
Using this technology, our colleague Nina Shah conducted the first study of CB -NK cells 
for patients with myeloma receiving high -dose melphalan and autologous HSCT 
(MDACC 2011 -0379).[14] In that tr ial CB -NK cells in doses up to 1e8 cells/kg could be 
reliably produced for clinical use and were well tolerated in the setting of high  
dose -melphalan and ASCT for myeloma. In that trial lenalidomide at [ADDRESS_430504] different B lymphoma cell lines, which is enhanced  

  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 5 of 26 
 in the presence of lenalidomide.[15] Those preclinical results and our clinical experience 
in myeloma have prompted us to further study of this novel cellular therapy in patients  
with B -cell lymphoma receiving an ASCT.

prescribing lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days).  
 
If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the sa me 
day. If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.  
 
Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide should be instructed 
to seek emergency medical care if needed and contact [CONTACT_58131].  
 
Reduced Dose BEAM : In patients who are >65 or with substantial comorbidities, a 
reduced dose of BEAM (with each dose of cytarabine and etoposide decreased to 100 
mg/m2) can be used, at the discretion of the patient's transplant physician. (See 
Appendices E. and F.)  
In patients  whose lymphomas are CD20 -negative, the use of rituximab will be omitted.

permitted by [CONTACT_346561]) from D -4 to D+7, then only if positive for donor NK 
cells, weekl y up to around D+30 (+/ - 3 days). After D+30 and until D+100 is not 
mandatory, only if positive for donor NK cells and if the patient comes for routine follow 
up. 
 
2. GvHD assessment:  
After the NK infusion (D -5) at each visit or as clinically indicated. When symptoms of 
GvHD are suspected a biopsy must be done prior to initiating treatment.  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 10 of 26 
  
3. Disease assessments around D+30, D+100, and  D+180:  
These evaluations follow our standard practice. If clinically indicated these studies 
may be done at othe r time points which can replace the nearest planned timepoint.  
 
 History and physical  exam.  
 Lab work: CBC, differential, platelets, SGPT, calcium, glucose, uric acid, 
magnesium, serum bilirubin, BUN and creatinine, serum protein, albumin, 
alkaline phosphata se, electrolytes,  urinalysis.  
 PET study if it was positive pretransplant. If it was negative, CT scans of the 
neck, chest abdomen and  pelvis.  
 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_346542].  
 
4. The following lab tests are to be performed as frequently as clinically indicated: CBC, 
differential, platelets, SGPT, calcium, glucose, uric acid, magnesium, serum bilirubin, 
BUN and creatinine, serum protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, electrolytes, 
urinalysis.  
 
5. Antitumor responses will be evalua ted according to the Lugano Revised Criteria for 
Response Assessment (see Appendix  G.).[16]  
 
6. Pregnancy  Testing : 
Pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential. A female of childbearing potential 
(FCBP) is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or 
bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 
consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive 
months).  
 
For FCBP, pregnancy tests must occur within 10 - 14 days and again within 24 hours 
prior to prescribing lenalidomide. (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and at Day  
+28 (+/ - 2 days) post the last dose (D -2) of lenalidomide.  
 
7. Correlative Studies  (Optional):  
To determine persistence of donor -deriv ed CB -NK cells in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_346543] D -4, D0 (before infusion of PBPC), D+7 and weekly thereafter, 
until negative results are obtained.  
 
We will employ our institution’s standard DNA microsatellite chimerism assay to detect 
donor CB -NK cells.[17] Briefly, PCR -based microsatellite polymorphism analysis will be 
performed using capi[INVESTIGATOR_257362] (CE -PCR) on DNA from the pre -transplant, 
CB donor and post -transplant PB samples. DNA from sorted T -lymphocytes (T -cells), 
myel oid cell (M -cells) and/or NK -cells will also be used in addition to the total DNA, as 
applicable. A total of 8 microsatellite regions (D6S264, D3S1282, D18S62, D3S1300, 
DM1, AR, D11S987 and D9S171) will be assessed in each specimen to identify the 
most  distinct or discriminating  (informative)  marker/s  between  CB donor  versus  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_346544]. The area under the curve for the informative marker will be used to calculate  the 
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 11 of 26 
 percent engraftment using the formula: % engraftment = 100 x 
[Donor/(Dono r+Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841])] DNA in post -transplant sample. The lower limit of detection 
for this assay has been established to be at 1%.  
 
In parallel, we will perform multiparameter flow cytometry to analyze the source (patient 
or CB) and the phenotype of circulating NK  cells. PB MNCs will be subjected to  
ficoll-separation. Thereafter, cells will be stained for the following: CD56, CD3, CD16, 
PAN KIR, NKG2D, NKG2A, NKp30, NK p44, NKp46, NKG2C. When possible,  
chimerism will be determined by [CONTACT_346562]-conjugated 
antibodies against HLA groups Bw4 or Bw6.  
8.0 Reporting Requirements  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_346545].  
 
Adverse events and protocol specific data will be entered into REDCap/CORe. 
REDCap/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form for this protocol. 
Concomitant medications will captured in participant s' medical records.  
 
Severity of the adverse events (AEs)  
The severity of the adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria v4.03 (CTCAE) from Day -5 (the start of NK cell infusion) up to 
D+30 (+3 days if necessary). Even ts not included in the CTCAE chart will be scored as 
follows:  
 
General grading:  
Grade 1: Mild: discomfort present with no disruption of daily activity, no treatment 
required beyond prophylaxis.  
Grade 2: Moderate: discomfort present with some disruption of daily activity, require 
treatment.  
Grade 3: Severe: discomfort that interrupts normal daily activity, not responding to first 
line treatment.  
Grade 4: Life Threatening: discomfort that represents immediate risk of death  
 
Causality Assessment  
The investigat ional component of the treatment plan of this study is the  infusion of ex -
vivo expanded CB NK cells when administrated with lenalidomide, high -dose 
chemotherapy with BEAM and autologous stem cell transplantation.  
 
Therefore, events known to be caused by [CONTACT_3433] e NK cell infusion and its direct 
consequences will be assessed as definitely related  when assessing the ca usality. 
When the relationship of the adverse event cannot be rule out between the NK cell 
infusion and the treatment plan, the event will be scored as probably or possible related.  
 
Events known to be related to drugs used as part of the treatment plan as well as to  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 12 of 26 
 drugs used as supportive treatment will be scored as unrelated  to the NK cells infusion.  
 
Causality will be determined as per the guidelines above and based on the expected 
toxicities listed below.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_346546].

 Low blood pressure due to dehydration requiring fluid  replacement.  
 Fluid overload leading to cardiac  dysfunction.  
 GI related: nausea, vomi ting, diarrhea,  mucositis.  
 Organ dysfunction: cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, CNS and/ or  renal.  
 Stem Cell Transplant Syndromes: Cytokine Storm, TTP, hemorrhagic

Adverse events data collection  
 
REDCap/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form (eCRF) for this protocol.  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 13 of 26 
 An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical 
condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related 
to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only 
considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug.  
 
Adverse events will be entered into the eCRF from day -5 to day +30.   The collection of 
adverse events will reflect the onset and resolution date and maximum grade. If a patient is 
taken  off study  while  an event  is still ongoing,  this will be followed  until resolution  unless  another 
therapy is initiated.  Intermittent events should be labeled as such and followed until resolution. 
Subjects who are removed from study due to an adverse event will continue to be followed until 
resolution of the event, evidence emerges that the event is stable and will not pro gress, or until 
death.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy and otherwise meet 
the criteria  for a reportable  adverse  event  as defined  above.  They  are to be captured  under  the 
signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with  them.  
 
Those adverse events that are suspected unexpected severe adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) 
should be reported to FDA in an expedited fashion as detailed  in 21CFR312.32. Adverse events 
will be reported in aggregate as part of the IND’s annual report.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_346547].  
 
Adverse events will be documented based on all available evidence, including the 
flowsheet in the electronic patient medical record.  
 
Concurrent medication  
As stated in the treatment plan, pa tients treated on this protocol will require supportive 
care treatment (concurrent medication). These medications are considered standard of 
care and have no scientific contributions to the protocol, therefore no data will be 
captured on the various medica tions needed or their sides effects.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
 Death  
 A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, h ad it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused  death.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  conduct 
normal life  functions.  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 14 of 26 
  A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, th ey may jeopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR  312.32).  
 
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious 
adverse events . Any important medical event can and should be reported as an  SAE 
if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND  Office.  
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures 
outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional 
Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Serious Unanticipated Adverse 
Events for Drugs and Devic es”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, 
expected  or unexpected,  must  be reported  to the IND Office,  regardless  of attribution 
(within 5 working days of knowledge of the  event).  
 All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study 
drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND  Office.  
 Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for  
safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC  IRB. 
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_430513] returned to baseline, progression of the event 
has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the  event.  
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_430514] be reported to the IND Office. This may 
include the development of a secondary  malignancy.  
 
 Patients who withdraw consent due to toxicities will be evaluable and considered 
treatment failu res. 
 
Reporting to FDA:  
 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR  312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_346548], Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional  
  
[ADDRESS_430515] to be infused, these results 
won’t be available at time of release; therefore this testing is not considered part of the 
release criteria. As a rapid microbial test, we perform a gr am stain and endotoxin test  as 
release criteria of the final fresh CB -NK product.  
 
The expected acceptable results for the Mycoplasma and Sterility are the following: 
Additional Monitoring Tests : 
Test Specifications  
Sterility  No Growth at 14 days  
Mycoplasma (PCR)  Negative  
 
In the event the [ADDRESS_430516] has been infused, the Laboratory Director, Laboratory 
Medical Director, Laboratory Quality Assurance Unit, Principle Investigator, and the 
Investigational New Drug (IND) Office Sponsor will be notified. The Quality Assurance 
Unit will conduct an investigation to determine if any corrective and/or preventative 
actions are required. The investigation and pr oposed corrections for a failure of lot 
release sterility testing will include: identification of the microorganism(s) and  
anti-microbial agent sensitivity testing; evaluation of the current procedure for collecting 
and processing the product to determine the step at which contamination could be 
introduced; development of changes in procedures that will assist in preventing sterility 
lapses in the future; and implementation of appropriate testing to ensure that such 
changes to procedures produce a sterile p roduct.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_346549] (FDA, IRB) of deviations and adverse events. Additionally, we will report the 
sterility failure, results of investigation of the cause and any correcti ve actions, in an 
information amendment submitted to the IND in a timely manner, within [ADDRESS_430517], 
disease progression, or day +[ADDRESS_430518].

 10.0 Statistical Considerations  
This is a phase II trial of high dose chemotherapy (Rituximab +BEAM + Lenalidomide) 
as a pr eparative regimen + umbilical cord blood derived NK cells + autologous stem cell 
transplant (autosct) for treatment of lymphoma that requires a stem cell transplant. A 
maximum of 40 patients will be treated, with an expected accrual rate of 2 patients per 
month. The primary outcome for safety monitoring is transplant related mortality within 
30 days, TRM30. A TRM30 probability of .10 will be considered unacceptably high. The 
method of Thall and Sung will be used for safety monitoring [18]. Assuming that pE = 
Pr(TRM30 with the experimental regimen) follows a non -informative beta (.10, .90) prior, 
and assuming standard probability pS ~ beta(100,900), the trial will be stopped early if 
Pr(pS < pE | data) > .50. Applying this rule continuously, the trial will be  stopped early if 
[# TRM30] / [# patients evaluated] is greater than or equal to 1/7, 2/17, 3/27, 4/37 or 
5/39.  
 
Pr(TRM30) will be estimated using a 95% credible interval assuming a beta(.50, .50 ) 
prior.  
 
This rule has the following operating characterist ics.

Secondary Outcomes. Relapse -free survival (RFS) time, overall survival (OS) time,  NK 
cell persistence, with NK cells measured weekly for 14 weeks will be recorded. RFS will 
be defined as the time from transplant to either progression/relapse or death, whichever 
occurs first, or last contact. OS will be defined as the time from transplant to death or 
last contact.  
 
Data Analyses . Unadjusted RFS and OS will be estimated by  [CONTACT_346564] [19]. A Bayesian hierarchical regression model [20] will be fit to the 
longitudinal NK cell data to assess its patterns over time and association with patient  
  
[ADDRESS_430519] 
experienced recurrences during Rituximab therapy and should be moni tored during and 
immediately after the infusion.  
 
Rituximab rapi[INVESTIGATOR_346551]20+ cells. Tumor lysis 
syndrome  has been  reported  to occur  within  [ADDRESS_430520] Rituximab  infusion 
in patients with high numbers of  circulating malignant lymphocytes. Patients with high 
tumor burden (ie, bulky lesions) may also be at risk.  Patients at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_346552].  
 
After treatmen t for and resolution of tumor lysis syndrome, subsequent Rituximab 
therapy has been administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for this 
syndrome in a limited number of cases.  
 
Warnings and precautions:  
 
Bowel obstruction/perforation: Abdominal p ain, bowel obstruction, and perforation have 
been reported (rarely fatal), with an average onset of symptoms of ~6 days (range: 1 -77 
days); complaints of abdominal pain or repeated vomiting should be evaluated,  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 18 of 26 
 especially if early in the tre atment course.  
 
• Hepatitis B virus reactivation: [U.S. Boxed Warning]: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
reactivation may occur with use and may result in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, 
and death. Screen all patients for HBV infection by [CONTACT_27911] B surface 
antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti -HBc) prior to therapy initiation; 
monitor patients for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV during and for 
several months after treatment. Discontinue rituximab (and concomitant medic ations) if 
viral hepatitis develops and initiate appropriate antiviral therapy. Reactivation has 
occurred in patients who are HBsAg positive as well as in those who are HBsAg 
negative  but are anti-HBc positive;  HBV reactivation  has also been  observed  in patients 
who had previously resolved HBV infection. HBV reactivation has been reported up to 
24 months after therapy discontinuation. Use cautiously in patients who show evidence 
of prior HBV infection (eg, HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or H BsAG 
negative but anti -HBc positive); consult with appropriate clinicians regarding monitoring 
and consideration of antiviral therapy before and/or during rituximab treatment. The 
safety of resuming rituximab treatment following HBV reactivation is not kno wn; discuss 
reinitiation of therapy in patients with resolved HBV reactivation with physicians 
experienced in HBV  management.  
 
• Infections: Use is not recommended if severe active infection is present; serious and 
potentially  fatal bacterial,  fungal,  and either  new or reactivated  viral infections  may occur 
during treatment and after completing rituximab. Infections have been observed in 
patients with prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia, defined as  hypogammaglobulinemia  
>11 months after rituximab exposure; moni tor immunoglobulin levels as necessary. 
Associated new or reactivated viral infections have included cytomegalovirus, herpes 
simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B and  
C. Discontinue rituximab (and concomita nt chemotherapy) in patients who develop viral 
hepatitis and initiate antiviral therapy. Discontinue rituximab in patients who develop 
other serious infections and initiate appropriate anti -infective treatment.  
 
• Infusion reactions: [U.S. Boxed Warning]: Se vere (occasionally fatal) infusion -related 
reactions have been reported, usually with the first infusion; fatalities have been 
reported within 24 hours of infusion; monitor closely during infusion; discontinue for 
severe reactions and provide medical inter vention for grades 3 or 4 infusion reactions. 
Reactions usually occur within 30 -120 minutes and may include hypotension, 
angioedema, bronchospasm, hypoxia, urticaria, and in more severe cases pulmonary 
infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myoc ardial infarction, ventricular 
fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and/or anaphylaxis. Risk factors associated with fatal 
outcomes include chronic lymphocytic leukemia, female gender, mantle cell lymphoma, 
or pulmonary infiltrates. Closely monitor patients wi th a history of prior cardiopulmonary 
reactions or with pre -existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions and patients with high 
numbers of circulating malignant cells (>25,000/mm3). Prior to infusion, premedicate 
patients with acetaminophen and an antihistamin e (and methylprednisolone for patients 
with RA). Discontinue infusion for severe reactions and serious or life -threatening 
cardiac arrhythmias. Perform cardiac monitoring during and after the infusion in  patients  
  
[ADDRESS_430521] a history of arrhythmia or 
angina. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions (eg, bronchodilators, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, corticosteroids) should be available for immediate use; 
treatment is symptomati c. Mild -to-moderate infusion -related reactions (eg, chills, fever, 
rigors) occur frequently and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_346553]. Infusion may be resumed at a 50% infusion rate reduction upon resolution of 
symptoms. Due to  the potential for hypotension, consider withholding antihypertensives 
12 hours prior to treatment.  
 
• Mucocutaneous reactions: [U.S. Boxed Warning]: Severe and sometimes fatal 
mucocutaneous reactions (lichenoid dermatitis, paraneoplastic  pemphigus,  
Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_346554]) 
have been reported; onset has been variable but has occurred as early as the first day 
of exposure. Discontinue in patients experiencing severe mucocutaneous skin 
reactions; the s afety of re -exposure following mucocutaneous reactions has not been 
evaluated.  
 
• Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: [U.S. Boxed Warning]: Progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to JC virus infection has been reported with 
rituximab use; may be fatal. Cases were reported in patients with hematologic 
malignancies receiving rituximab either with combination chemotherapy, or with 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Cases were also reported in patients receiving 
rituximab for autoimmune d iseases who had received concurrent or prior 
immunosuppressant therapy. Onset may be delayed, although most cases were 
diagnosed within [ADDRESS_430522] rituximab dose. A retrospective analysis of 
patients (n=57) diagnosed with PML following rituximab  therapy, found a median of 16 
months (following rituximab initiation), 5.5 months (following last rituximab dose), and 6 
rituximab doses preceded PML diagnosis. Clinical findings included 
confusion/disorientation, motor weakness/hemiparesis, altered visio n/speech, and poor 
motor coordination with symptoms progressing over weeks to months (Carson, 2009). 
Promptly  evaluate  any patient  presenting  with neurological  changes;  consider  neurology 
consultation, brain MRI and lumbar puncture for suspected PML. Disco ntinue rituximab 
in patients who develop PML; consider reduction/discontinuation of concurrent 
chemotherapy or  immunosuppressants.  
 
11.2 Etoposide  
Etoposide (VP -16) is a semisynthetic podophyllotoxin derivative with antineoplastic 
activity.  
 
Pharmaceutical data: VP-16 is supplied as 100 mg/5cc ampules.  
 
Solution preparation: The contents of the vial are diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride 
for injection, USP. The final concentration of the admixture must be 0.2 mg/mL - 0.4 
mg/mL. Solutions prepar ed above 0.4 mg/mL may contain precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047].  
 
Route of administration: Slow IV infusion.  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 20 of 26 
  
Known side -effects: Myelosuppression, primarily granulocytopenia is the dose -limiting 
toxicity. Other side effects include gastrointestinal toxicity com prising of nausea, emesis 
and mucositis. At high doses reversible hepatotoxicy is seen. Acute side effects include 
occasional bronchospasm and hypotension. These can be avoided by [CONTACT_346565].  
 
Hypersensitivity reaction: May cause anaph ylactic -like reactions manifested by [CONTACT_346566], 
fever, tachycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and hypotension. In addition, facial/tongue 
swelling, coughing, chest tightness, cyanosis, laryngospasm, diaphoresis, hypertension, 
back pain, loss of consciousness, an d flushing have also been reported less commonly. 
Incidence is primarily associated with intravenous administration (up to 2%) compared 
to oral administration (<1%). Infusion should be interrupted and medications for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis should be available for immediate use. High drug 
concentration and rate of infusion, as well as presence of polysorbate [ADDRESS_430523] been suggested as contributing 
factors to the development of hypersensitivity  reactions. Etoposide intravenous 
formulations may contain polysorbate 80 and/or benzyl alcohol, while etoposide 
phosphate (the water soluble prodrug of etoposide) intravenous formulation does not 
contain either vehicle. Case reports have suggested that et oposide phosphate has  been 
used successfully in patients with previous hypersensitivity reactions to  etoposide.  
 
• Secondary malignancies: Secondary acute leukemias have been reported with 
etoposide,  either  as monotherapy  or in combination  with other  chemotherapy  agents.  
 
Pharmacokinetics: The main site of metabolism is in the liver. Major metabolites of 
etoposide are hydroxy acids and cistactone which appear in the plasma and urine. The 
half-life of the drug is 4 to 11 hours.  
 
Mechanism of action: Two different dose dependent responses are seen. At high 
concentrations (10 ug/ml) lysis of cells entering mitosis is seen. At low concentrations 
(0.3 to 10 ug/ml) cells are inhibited from entering prophase. The predominant 
macromolecular affect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks 
by [CONTACT_346567].  
 
11.3.  Cytarabine  
Cytarabine is a synthetic antimetabolite antineoplastic agent.  
 
Dosing information: Usual induction dose for ANLL  (acute non -lymphocytic leukemia) 
has been 100 to 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 to 7 days (in combination with other cytoxic 
agents).  
Pharmacokinetics: Following IV administration, cytarabine is widely distributed to 
areas including the CNS and tears; the drug is orally active. Cytarabine is metabolized 
in the liver to an inactive metaolite; both cytarabine and its metabolite are excreted in 
the urine. The elimination half -life is between 1 and 3hours.  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 21 of 26 
 Side Effects: The major toxic effect of cytarabine is myelosuppression resulting in 
megaloblastic changes in erythropoiesis and reticulocytopenia. Other adverse effects 
include neuropathies, GI distress, hepatic toxicity, and hypersensitivity.  
 
Clinical Applications: Cytarabine is useful in various neoplastic disorders including 
myelocyticleukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, and non lymphocytic.  
 
11.4.  Melphalan  
Melphalan is an alkylating agent with cell cycle nonspecific cytotoxic effects on tumor 
cells.  
 
Dosing Information: The usual dose for condit ioning in stem cell transplantation is 
100-200 mg/m2intravenously.  
 
Pharmacokinetics: Orally administered melphalan demonstrates considerable variation 
in bio availability, does not undergo active metabolism, and is primarily eliminated in the 
feces. Howev er, compromised renal function may significantly impact melphalan 
excretion.  
 
Side Effects:  
 
(>10%) Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, oral mucosa ulcer 
Hematologic & oncologic: Anemia, bone marrow depression, leukopenia (nadir: 14 to 21 
days ; recovery: 28 to 35 days), metastases (ꞏ20%; cumulative dose and duration 
dependent; includes acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative syndrome, carcinoma), 
thrombocytopenia (nadir: 14 to 21 days; recovery: 28 to 35  days)  
(1% to 10%) Hypersensitivity: H ypersensitivity reaction (IV: 2%; includes 
bronchospasm, dyspnea, edema, hypotension, pruritus, skin rash, tachycardia, 
urticaria)  
Frequency not defined:  
Cardiovascular: Cardiotoxicity (angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, 
myocardial infarction; with high -dose therapy), hepatic veno -occlusive disease (hepatic 
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome; SOS; high -dose IV melphalan), vasculitis  
Central nervous system: Brain disease, flushing sensation, seizure (with high -dose 
therapy), tingling sen sation  
Dermatologic: Allergic skin reaction, alopecia, maculopapular rash, pruritus 
Endocrine & metabolic: Amenorrhea, SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic 
hormone secretion)  
Gastrointestinal: Mucositis (with high -dose therapy), paralytic ileus (w ith high -dose 
therapy), stomatitis  
Genitourinary: Hemorrhagic cystitis, inhibition of testicular function, nephrotoxicity (with 
high-dose therapy), ovarian function suppression, sterility  
Hematologic & oncologic: Agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure (irrev ersible), hemolytic 
anemia, hemorrhage (with high -dose therapy)  
Hepatic: Hepatitis, increased serum transaminases, jaundice 
Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis (rare), hypersensitivity reaction  
  
2015 -0751  Version 12, 05 May 2020  Page 22 of 26 
 Infection: Infection, sepsis  
Local: Injection site re action (injection site necrosis, ulceration) 
Neuromuscular & skeletal: Myelopathy (radiation)  
Renal: Increased blood urea nitrogen  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis  
 
Clinical Applications: Melphalan has a broad spectrum of antitumor  activity, but its 
main use in the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and non -resectable.  
 
11.5.  Carmustine  
Carmustine is a nitrosourea derivative alkylating agent.  
 
Dosing Information: As a single agent 150 to 200 mg/m2 IV.  
 
Pharmacokinetics: Carmustine is highly lipid soluble and readily crosses into the CSF. 
The drug is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_346555] 15 
minutes; some metabolites are known to be active. About 60 to 70% of a dose is 
eliminated in the urine.  
 
Side Ef fects : Delayed and cumulative myelosuppression is the most frequent and 
profound toxicity of Carmustine. Thrombocytopenia is usually more serious than 
leukopenia; however, both may be dose -limiting. Other adverse effects include 
pulmonary fibrosis, nausea and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity.  
 
Clinical Applications: Carmustine is used alone or in combination with other 
appropriate therapeutic measures in the treatment of various neoplastic conditions such 
as Hodgkin's disease, brain tumors, mult iple myeloma, and non -Hodgkin's lymphoma.  
 
11.6.  Lenalidomide

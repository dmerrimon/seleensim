Methodology:  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -design study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of TVB -2640 compared with matching placebo in  subjects with NASH  who are  
aged ≥18 years  at Screening. Histological eligibility will be determined during the Screening period or 
prior to Screening but within 180 days of the Screening visit in 1 of 2 ways:  
• If an ‘eligible’ and adequate (this refers to the quality and quantity of remaining tissue) 
liver histology specimen, in the judgement of the central pathologist, exists from the time 
period within [ADDRESS_1065315]’s Screening visit , the subject may participat e so 
long as other eligibility criteria are satisfied.  
• If no liver histology specimen exists from the period within [ADDRESS_1065316] undergo liver biopsy during the Screening period.  
Approximately 162 unique subjects  with liver fibrosis stage F2 -F3 will be enrolled and randomized to 
achieve a 2:1 ratio with approximately 1 08 subjects on TVB -2640 50  mg and 54 subjects on placebo . 
Dynamic allocation is used for the randomization, stratified by 3 factors: T2DM status ( yes or no), 
region (North America  or not North America), and amount of fibrosis (F2 or F3) .  
Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 90 days before randomization  (randomization is 
within 3 days of Baseline [Day 1]) . Subjects who are determined to be eligible for the study based on 
Screening assessments are to be randomized  into the study within 3 days  before Baseline ( ie, Day [ADDRESS_1065317] day of study drug administration ). Subjects who are randomized are considered to be enrolled 
in the study.   
Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  [ADDRESS_1065318] is unable to complete the end of treatment MRI -PDFF and/or liver biopsy within 
the protocol -specified window (Week 52 +/ - one week), extended dosing is permitted to maintain 
continuous dosing up to the time both assessments are compl eted, to a maximum total of [ADDRESS_1065319] dose (+/ - one week).  
In the instance of a dose hold due to an AE or SAE, the decision to resume study drug will require 
consultation with the Investigator, the CRO’s Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor’s Chief Medical 
Officer.  
Improvement of NAS and improvement of fibrosis score  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_775656] 52 liver histology specimens. Subjects will also undergo MRI -PDFF  prior to the start of 
treatment , at Week 26,  and at Week 52  or Early Termination . Other efficacy and pharmacodynamic 
(PD) assessments include FibroSca n with CAP , and measurement of liver aminotransferase s, lipid 
parameters, and other noninvasive biomarkers of NASH and liver fibrosis  throughout the study .  
During the study, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_18651], 12 -lead electrocardiogram s (ECG s), physical 
examination s including eye examination s, and clinical laboratory testing. Subjects will be evaluated 
for AEs and concomitant medication use throughout the study.   
 
 
  
An in dependent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be established by [CONTACT_775657] a 
systematic manner to safeguard the safety of study subjects. The IDMC will be tasked with making 
recommendations to the Sponsor  to continue, amend, or stop the study based on these assessments.  
A single secondary endpoint efficacy interim analysis (IA) is planned when approximately 60 subjects 
with MRI -PDFF value of ≥8% liver fat at Baseline have complete d Week 26 or an Early Termination 
visit after Week 22. The purpose of the proposed interim analysis is to examine the TVB -2640 benefit 
over placebo based on a Week 26 secondary efficacy endpoint consisting of “ proportion of MRI -PDFF 
≥30% responders at Week 26, where an MRI -PDFF ≥30% responder is defined as a subject with ≥8% 
liver fat content at B aseline who achieves a percent change (reduction) from Baseline in MRI -PDFF 
≥30% .” 
Interim safety summaries will accompany the interim analys is of the secondary efficacy endpoint.  
Number of Subject s (planned):  
Approximately 162 unique subjects  with liver fibrosis stage F2 -F3 will be enrolled and randomized to 
achieve  a 2:1 ratio to receive TVB-2640 50 mg or placebo  (approximately 108 for TVB -2540 50 mg 
and approximately 54 subjects for placebo) PO QD for 52 weeks .

Statistical Methods:  
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint:  The primary efficacy endpoint  is the proportion of 
subjects experiencing either a histological improvement at Week 52 in NAS  (ie, ≥2 points 
improvement in NAS with ≥1 point improvement in ballooning or inflammation ) and without 
worsening of fibrosis (by [CONTACT_775653] ), OR resolution of steatohepatitis and no 
worsening of liver fibrosis  (by [CONTACT_775653]) . The treatment groups will be compared 
based on the primary efficacy endpoint using a one-sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test 
stratified by  [CONTACT_775667] T2DM status (yes or no), region (North America  or not 
North America ), and amount of fibrosis  (F2 or F3) at the 0.05 significance level (where a higher 
responder proportion is a better outcome) and will be based on the Intention -to-Treat (ITT) population . 
The response Clopper -Pearson 90% and 95% confidence interval s (CI) will be derived for each 
treatment group.  
A sensitivity analysis employing a logistic regression will be used to examine the robustness of the 
CMH results (see details described in the statistical section, below) .  
A subject who discontinues treatment prior to Week 4 2, does not provide a histological assessment on 
or after Week  42, or who otherwise has missing data will be considered a non -responder.  
Further sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will employ multiple imputations for 
binary data . Pertinent details are included in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). 
Analysis of the secondary efficacy  and pharmacodynamics  endpoints : The analysis of the 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on the ITT population. The imputation mechanism used in 
the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will also be adopted where applicable.  
The analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints of a categorical nature will be analyzed in a manner 
similar to the primary efficacy endpoint.  
For the continuous secondary endpoints  such as change from Baseline and percent change from 
Baseline, the Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be used to compare the treatment groups . For the continuous 
secondary endpoints, an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model will also be used with change from 
Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  17 of 97 
Protocol SB2640 -CLIN -007 
 
Version 4.0 Baseline ( and percent change from Baseline) as the dependent variable ; treatment group, T2DM status 
(yes or no), region (North America  or not North America) , and amount of fibrosis  (F2 or F3) as 
factors ; and Baseline as a covariate. L east-square s means and their differences will be estimated from 
the ANCOVA model and their corresponding 95% CI will be derived. Inferential statistics will be 
presented for both the ANCOVA model and the Wilcoxon test. For the continuous secondary 
endpoints with suffi cient postbaseline frequency of measurements, a mixed model repeated measure 
(MMRM) model will also be employed.  
Analysis of PK parameters:  Planned PK parameters will be calculated for each subject with serial PK 
samples employing the standard linear trapezoidal convention using all available drug concentration 
measurements. Specifically, the following TVB -2640  PK parameters will be estimated (via 
noncompartmental methods):  time to maximum concentration ( Tmax), maximum concentration ( Cmax), 
area under the concentration -time curve from time of dosing to the last measured concentration ( AUC 0-
last), area under the concen tration -time curve from time of dosing extrapolated to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), and 
plasma elimination half -life ( t1/2). Standard descriptive statistics (mean, median, n, standard deviation, 
minimum, maximum, coefficient of variation) will be used to summarize the stated PK parameters 
along with the corresponding 90% CI whenever appropriate. All subject -level concentrations will be 
provided in a listing and the stated summary statistics presented in a tabular format. Graphical 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_775633].  Sparse PK sample 
results will be analyzed using a population PK model.  
Definition of analysis populations:  
• Intention -to-Treat (ITT) population: Comprises all randomized subjects; this population will serve 
as the basis for all efficacy analyses. Subjects’ data will be analyzed according to their 
randomized treatment assignment . 
• Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT): Comprises all subjects in the ITT population  who have 
completed at least 4 2 weeks of treatment  and ha ve an evaluable posttreatment histological 
assessment . 
• Interim Analys is Modified Intention -to-Treat (IAmITT): Comprises a subset of subjects in the ITT 
population with 8% >/= MRI -PDFF at screening or at baseline with at least [ADDRESS_1065329] dose of study drug.  
• The Safety analysis set: Comprises all subjects who are randomized and received at least 1 dose 
(partial or complete) of study drug.  
• PK Population: Comprises all subjects in the ITT population with available PK measurements.  
Power considerations and sample size determination : The study estimated total sample size is 
approximately 162 randomized subjects (108 on TVB -2640 and 54 on placebo ). The sample size was 
derived using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, and the estimated power to detect 
a difference in the primary efficacy response of 20% (TVB -2640 40% and placebo  20% at Week 52) 
was at least 80% (one -sided test at the 0.05 significance level). A 2 -to-1 randomization allocation was 
assumed (TVB -2640 to placebo ). An anticipated dropout rate of 18.5% was also applied to estimate 
the final sample size (N=162) . 
Safety Analyses  
Safety data will be evaluated for the Safety population on the basis of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECGs, weight , and physical examination s. 
Changes from Baseline in key clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, physical examinations, 
and weight will be summarized by [CONTACT_775668]. TEAE 
incidence rates will be summarized using frequency and percentage for each treatment group  and in 
total. TEAEs through [ADDRESS_1065330] dose of study treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_775669]  18 of 97 
Protocol SB2640 -CLIN -007 
 
Version 4.0 (current version ) system organ class , and preferred term. AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_422870] ( NCI CTCAE ) (current version)  
grade , and by [CONTACT_2235] (attribution to study treatment, related/ not related to investigational medicinal 
product). All safety data will be presented in data listings . 
Interim Analysis  
A single (secondary endpoint) efficacy interim analysis is planned when approximately 60 subjects 
with an MRI -PDFF value of ≥8% liver fat at Baseline  have completed Week 26 or an Early 
Termination visit after Week 22.  The purpose of the proposed interim analys is is to examine the TVB -
2640 benefit over placebo based on a Week 26 secondary efficacy endpoint consisting of “proportion 
of MRI -PDFF ≥30% responders,  where an MRI -PDFF ≥30% responder is defined as a subject with 
≥8% liver fat content at Baseline who  achieves a percent change (reduction) from Baseline in MRI -
PDFF ≥30% ”. An interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint is not feasible since the primary 
endpoint is only evaluated at Week 52, and not Week 26. Therefore, a statistical penalty is not 
envisaged in conjunction with the Week 26 interim analysis of the above -stated secondary endpoint.   
Interim safety summaries will accompany the interim analys is of the secondary efficacy endpoint.   
Planned study committees:  An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be established 
by [CONTACT_775670] a systematic manner to safeguard the safety of study subjects. The interim analysis will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_775671] a 
more complete examination of the totality of the data.

 Version 4.0  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease  
Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme in the de novo  lipogenesis (DNL) pathway and 
catalyzes the biosynthesis of palmitate from  acetyl -coenzyme A (CoA) and malonyl -CoA  
substrates , which can then undergo further modifications  into other fatty acids and complex 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] . Because FAS N catalyzes the last step in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, it is believed 
to be a determinant of the maximal liver capacity to synthesize fatty acids by [CONTACT_278323] 
(Postic,  2008 ). 
Dysregulation of FASN activity is found in a number of different disease states , including cancer 
(Buckley, 2017 ) and metabolic diseases  (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes  mellitus [T2DM] ) 
(Menendez,  2009 ).  
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges from simple steatosis to the more progressive  
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) characterized by [CONTACT_775677], chronic 
inflammation, and  resultant  fibrosis  formation . Patients with NASH are at increased risk of death 
due to advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as 
cardiovascular disease . Risk factors of developi[INVESTIGATOR_775637]  T2DM (Cusi, 2016 ), obesity , 
and metabolic  syndrome , all characterized by [CONTACT_775678] 
(Grundy, 2005 ). This imbalance may lead  to dysregulated metabolic pathways and inflammatory 
responses that drive further changes leading to liver damage and comorbid conditions . NASH is 
the most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_775638] (US)  
(Younossi, 2020 ). 
Normal responses to ingesting  carbohydrate in meals include a transient increase in hepatic 
DNL, a FASN -dependent pathway, followed by a return to baseline levels upon fasting. I n 
patients  with NAFLD , however, hepatic DNL is increased (Donnelly , 2005 ; Lambert , 2014 ), and 
FASN gene expression has been shown to be elevated in liver histology specimens from patients 
with NAFLD (Kohjima, 2007 ; Mitsuyoshi, 2009 ), contributing to elevated liver stores of 
triglycerides and saturated fatty acid species, which in turn may contribute to liver inflammation  
(Wei, 2006 ), tissue damage, and fibrosis  formation . 
There are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment of NASH  in the US, Europe,  or China . 
Inhibiting lipogenesis, with a FASN inhibitor for example, may be a viable clinical strategy to 
address NASH. Pharmacological inhibition of FASN with TVB -3664 , a chemical surrogate of 
TVB -2640 , improved hepatic steatosis, inflammation , and fibrosis in a diet-induced mouse 
model of NASH  (Duke , 2017 ). Moreover, s tudies in patients with NASH have shown that 
inhibition of DNL with the acetyl -CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor s firsocostat  (Stiede, 2017 ) 
and PF -[ADDRESS_1065349] 
consequence of ACC inhibition  (Sanyal, 2017 ; Kim, 2018 ). Further studies are needed, however, 
to evaluate the full spectrum of treatment effects elicited by [CONTACT_775679].

 Version 4.0  5.2. TVB -2640  
Sagimet Biosciences has developed an oral  (PO) , once -daily (QD) FASN inhibitor, TVB -2640. 
This drug has been evaluated in >300 humans to date , including patients with NASH, patients 
with solid tumors , and healthy adults, some of whom had characteristics of the metabolic 
syndrome. The safety, pharmacokinetic ( PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD)  parameters of 
TVB -[ADDRESS_1065350] been enrolled in the US and 
China in Study  CLIN -005 (FASCINATE -1). In the US, subjects received 25  mg TVB -2640, 
50 mg TVB -2640, or placebo PO, QD for approximately 12 weeks. A total of 6 8 subjects were 
treated with TVB -2640. O verall, 62  (63%) subject s experienced at least 1  treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE ), all of which were assessed by [CONTACT_57746], with the exception 
of [ADDRESS_1065351] infection and Grad e 2 increased appetite at 25  mg and 
Grade 2 dyspnea at 50  mg, all of which resolved without dose adjustment.  No on -treatment 
serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in either TVB -[ADDRESS_1065352] s were headache ([ADDRESS_1065353] s; 9%) and 
peripheral edema, rash, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] ([ADDRESS_1065354] s each; 6%) . Two (3%) 
subject s discontinued TVB -2640 due to a TEAE : [ADDRESS_1065355] due to mild eye allergy (after 1 day of 
dosing) and the other due to mild conjunctivitis; both of these events occurred in the 25 -mg dose 
group . 
Among  the 30 subjects  enrolled  in China , 21 were  treated with TVB -2640 50 mg  and 9 were 
treated with  placebo  for 12  weeks . Seventeen  (81.0%)  patients experienced at least [ADDRESS_1065356] common TEAEs among 
TVB -2640 -treated patients were  dry eye (8  patients), skin exfoliation  (7 patients),  and palmar -
plantar  erythrodysest hesia  syndrome  (PPE)  and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]  (each 3 
patients).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TVB -2640 reduced hepatic DNL  in subjects with features of metabolic syndrome ( Syed -Abdul, 
2020 ). Reduction of DNL was dose  dependent . The lowest dose tested, [ADDRESS_1065357] use 2 forms of birth control, one being a barrier 
method (ie, condoms, diaphragm, nonhormonal intrauterine device [ IUD]) throughout the study 
and for at least 3 months after the final study d rug dose. Hormonal contraception (stable 
≥3 months) and hormonal IUDs are permitted if used with a secondary barrier birth control 
method ( e.g., condoms).

 Version 4.0  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -design study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of TVB -2640 compared with matching placebo in subjects with 
NASH  who are aged ≥18 years  at Screening . Histological eligibility will be  determined during 
the Screening period or prior to Screening but within 180 days  of the Screening visit  in 1 of 2 
ways:   
• If an ‘eligible’ and adequate (this refers to the quality and quantity of remaining tissue) 
liver histology specimen, in the judgement of the central pathologist, exists from the time 
period within [ADDRESS_1065362]’s Screening visit , the subject may participat e so 
long as other eligibility criteria are satisfied.  
• If no liver histology specimen exists from the period within [ADDRESS_1065363] undergo liver biopsy during the Screening period.  
Approximately 162 unique subjects  with liver fibrosis  stage F2 -F3 will be enrolled and 
randomized to achieve a 2:[ADDRESS_1065364] s on TVB -2640 50 mg  and 
54 subjec ts on placebo . Dynamic allocation is used for the randomization, stratified by 3 factors: 
T2DM status ( yes or no), region (North America  or not North America) , and amount of fibrosis  
(F2 or F3).  
Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 90 days before randomization  
(randomization is within 3 days of Baseline [Day 1]) . Subjects who are determined to be eligible 
for the study based on Screening assessments are to be randomized into the study within 3 days 
before Baseline  (ie, Day 1, the first day of study drug administration). Subjects who are 
randomized are considered to be enrolled in the  study.  
Subjects will receive TVB -[ADDRESS_1065365] is unable to complete the end of treatment MRI -PDFF and/or liver biopsy 
within the protocol -specified window (Week 52 +/ - one week ), extended dosing is permitted to 
maintain continuous dosing up to the time both assessments are completed, to a maximum total 
of [ADDRESS_1065366] dose (+/ - one week).  
In the instance of a dose hold due to an AE or SAE, the decision to resume study drug will 
require consultation with the Investigator, the CRO’s Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor’s Chief 
Medical Officer.  
Improvement of NAS and improvement of fibrosis score will be evaluated by [CONTACT_775687] [ADDRESS_1065367] has completed less than 22 weeks of study treatment.  Other efficacy and PD assessments 
include FibroScan  with CAP, and measurement of liver aminotransferases, lipid parameters, and 
other noninvasive biomarkers of NASH and liver fibrosis  throughout the study .  
During the study, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_18651], 12-lead ECG s, physical examination s 
including eye examination s, and clinical laboratory testing. Subjects will be evaluated for AEs 
and concomitant medication use throughout the study.  
 
 
. 
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be established by [CONTACT_775657] a 
systematic manner to safeguard the safety of study subjects. The IDMC will be tasked with 
making recommendations to the Sponsor  to continue, amend, or stop the study based on these 
assessments.  
A secondary endpoint efficacy interim analysis (IA) is planned when approximately  60 subjects 
with a n MRI -PDFF value of ≥8% liver fat at Baseline have complete d Week 26 or an Early 
Termination visit after Week 22 . The purpose of the proposed interim analysis is to examine the 
TVB -2640 benefit over placebo  based on a Week 26 secondary efficacy endpoint consisting of 
“proportion of MRI -PDFF ≥30% responders at Week 26, where an MRI -PDFF ≥30% responder 
is defined as a subject with ≥8% liver fat content at Baseline who achieves a percent change 
(reduction) from Baseline in MRI -PDFF ≥30% .”  
Interim summaries of safety and selected biomarker data will accompany the interim efficacy 
analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoint.   
The study design is summarized in Error! Reference source not found. , and the Schedule of 
Assessments is provided in Figure  1: Study Design

7.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_775639]:   
• ≥[ADDRESS_1065368] experiences a Grade 5 TEAE (ie, TEAE with a fatal outcome)  
• ≥2 subjects experience the same Grade 4 TEAE  
In such cases, the Sponsor ’s Chief Medical Officer and the clinical research organization’s 
(CRO ’s) Medical Monitor will review blinded data to determine if the IDMC need s to be 
convened to  review the unblinded data to determine the relationship of the TEAE(s) to TVB -
2640 . The IDMC  will make a recommendation to the Sponsor  regarding whether to continue, 
amend, or stop the study.  
7.3. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Dose modification will be allowed for subjects  who experience an on -target AE considered to be 
treatment related that would otherwise lead to study or treatment discontinuation. Th e decision to 
reduce the dose of study drug will require consultation with the Investigator, the CRO’s Medical 
Monitor,  and the Sponsor ’s Chief Medical Officer . To preserve the study blind, the total number 
of combined tablets of study drug and matching placebo will remain the same. The subject’s 
study drug assignment  will NOT be unblinded.  Dose modification is not allowed for subjects 
who have any of the TEAEs described in Section 8.3 that require permanent discontinuation . 
Additional details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Dose interruptions may also be allowed  (see also  Appendix  A and Section 8.3).  
In the instance of a dose hold due to an AE or SAE, the decision to resume study drug will 
require consultation with the Investigator, the CRO’s Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor’s Chief 
Medical Officer.  
7.4. Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC will be established to provide independent review and assessment of study data and to 
monitor the overall study conduct in a systematic manner in order to safeguard the safety of 
study subjects. The IDMC will be tasked with making recommendations to the Sponsor  to 
continue, amend, or stop the study based on these assessments.

The US  Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and other applicable regulatory authorities require 
accounting of all investigational drug received by [CONTACT_180443] . Records of drug disposition 
required include the date received by [CONTACT_16018], date administered, quantity administered, and 
the subject  to whom study drug was administered . The Investigator is responsible for the 
accountability of all used and unused study drug containers and unused study drug .  
Study drug (and placebo) will be provided to the investigational site. Site personnel will 
acknowledge receipt of the study drug using interactive response technology ( IRT) to confirm 
the shipment condition and content. If a damaged shipment is received and/or a temperature 
excursion has been incurred , site personnel  will notify the Sponsor/CRO and follow the 
guidelines according to the current version of the study’s Pharmacy Manual.  
The designated personnel will maintain accurate records of the study drug  throughout the clinical 
study, including the inventory delivered to the study center, the use by [CONTACT_6992], the 
reconciliation of all delivered  study drug , and the return of unused study drug as specified in the 
current version of the Pharmacy Manual.

 Version 4.0  The study monitor should check the study supplies at each study center at any time during the 
study. It is the responsibility of the study monitor to ensure that the Investigator (or designee) has 
correctly documented the amount of the study drug received, dispensed, and returned on the 
dispensing log that will be provided  to site staff . Details will be provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
A full drug accountability log will be maintained at the study center at all times. The study 
monitor will arrange collection of any unused study drug. The study monitor will also perform an 
inventory of study drug at the close -out visit to the study cente r. All discrepancies must be 
accounted for and documented.  
9.5. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
All subjects will receive study drug PO QD for 52 weeks or until the final on -study investigation 
(MRI -PDFF  and/or liver biopsy) . The first dose of study drug should be taken at the study site 
under supervision of study staff.  
In the event a subject is unable to complete the end of treatment MRI -PDFF and/or liver biopsy 
within the protocol -specified window (Week 52 +/ - one week), extended dosing is permitted to 
maintain continuous dosing up to the time both assessments are compl eted, to a maximum total 
of [ADDRESS_1065384] dose (+/ - one week).  
In the instance of a dose hold due to an AE or SAE, the decision to resume study drug will 
require consultation with the Investigator, the CRO’s Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor’s Chief 
Medical Officer.  
Each QD dose of study drug is to be taken at the same time of day in the evening with or without 
food, with each dose separated by [CONTACT_3450] 24 hours (±4  hours).  
Subjects will receive one of the following each day, based on their blinded treatment assignment:  
• Placebo:  one placebo tablet matching the 50 -mg TVB -2640 tablet and one placebo tablet 
matching the 25 -mg TVB -2640 tablet  
• TVB -2640 50 mg:  one [ADDRESS_1065385] 
will continue to receive 2 tablets QD as follows  to preserve the study blind  (see the Pharmacy 
Manual for additional details ):  
• Dose adjustment from TVB -2640 50 mg to TVB -2640  25 mg:  one 25 -mg TVB -2640 
tablet and one placebo tablet matching the 50 -mg TVB -2640 tablet  
• Dose adjustment for those randomized to  placebo:  there will be no change in the size 
or number of placebo tablets . To maintain the blind, the subject  will be provided with 
new study drug bottles

Table  2). Returned study drug should not be redispensed.  
All subjects, Investigators, the Sponsor, and the CRO will be blinded to the treatment assignment 
of each individual subject. Members of the IDMC and the IDMC’s independent statistician will 
be unblinded to treatment assignment as needed. In addition, specific vendors wh ose role in 
study conduct requires them to be unblinded ( e.g., personnel operationally associated with the 
IWRS) may also be unblinded.  
Subjects will be randomized to achieve a 2:[ADDRESS_1065386] s on placebo. Dynamic allocation will be  used 
for the randomization, stratified by 3 factors: T2DM status ( yes or no), region (North America  or 
not North America), and amount of fibrosis (F2 or F3).   

Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  [ADDRESS_1065387]’s safety or well -being, the  Investigator may request a code from the 
CRO in order to break the randomization code for the subject via the IWRS, by [CONTACT_775690].  The unblinding and its cause will also be documented on the eCRF.

11.1.2.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies  
All imaging studies will be interpreted centrally by a trained image analyst. The analyst will be 
blinded to the subject’s treatment group allocation and will not have access to the subject’s 
clinical and biochemical data. The results of the central imaging interpretation will be used in the 
analysis of imaging data.  
For incidental findings, a radiology assessment of images will also be performed by [CONTACT_775696]. Personnel interpreting 
imaging will also be blinded to the subject’s treatment group allocation, and clinical and 
biochemical data. The assessment will be reported to the Investigator at the referring site, who 
will review and file the assessment in the subject´s source documents. The subjects will be 
invited for follow up if there are clinically significant incidental findings, and findings will be 
evaluated as potential AEs. The incidental finding will not be part of the central imaging . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Proton -density Liver Fat Fraction by [CONTACT_775697] -PDFF is a noninvasive, quantitative, and accurate measure of liver fat content to assess 
treatment response in early -phase NASH studie s (Caussy 2018 ). Subjects who are randomized 
will have repeat liver fat content measurements performed  in accordance with the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Figure  1: Study Design

Table  2). Scans may be repeated if an inconclusive result occurs ( e.g., if there is excessive 
subject movement during the scan).  MRI -PDFF will not be performed at selected sites. MRI -
PDFF is optional if it presents a logistical or physical hardship to the subject. In addition, MRI -
PDFF is not required at Early Termination if a subject has completed less than [ADDRESS_1065400] for 3 hours before a FibroS can is performed ; however, normal 
volumes of water are allowed.  
FibroScan is a specialized ultrasound of the liver, which measures stiffness  by [CONTACT_434710] , a surrogate of liver fibrosis , in units of kPa. Normal results  for FibroScan are 
generally considered to be lower than  6 or 7 kPa. The degree of liver stiffness and with it , 
fibrosis, will be assessed using FibroScan .  
Vibration -controlled transient elastography with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)  is a 
technology based on the principle of the ultrasonic attenuation of transient elastography 
depending on the viscosity (fat content ) of the liver and the distance of propagation of the 
ultrasonic signals into the liver, providing a useful method for the quantitative detection of liver 
fat content . CAP is measured by a FibroScan device in decibels per meter (dB/m) and reflects the 
decrease in the amplitude of ultrasound signal in the liver. Therefore, a higher CAP is reflective 

Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  66 of 97 
Protocol SB2640 -CLIN -007 
 
 Version 4.0  of a higher degree of steatosis  (Zenovia, 2021 ). A CAP score will be calculated at each time a 
FibroScan is performed unless the enrolling site does not have the capability to measure CAP . 
A FAST score will also be calculated each time FibroScan , CAP , and AST are performed. The 
FAST score is a FibroScan -based composite score that combines the results of the FibroScan 
liver stiffness  measurement , CAP , and AST  (Newsome, 2020 ). 
11.1.4.  Digital Pathology  
Digital pathology  is a novel technology using imaging techniques to objectively and 
quantitatively assess liver tissue biopsy samples. Th ese optical imaging modalit ies can be used  to 
accurately stage fibrosis in biopsy specimens , as well as to analyze other histological 
components of NASH .  
11.1.5.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details regarding clinical efficacy/pharmacodynamic 
laboratory sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Lipid and Metabolic Panel, Glyc osylated Hemoglobin, and Lipoprotein Particle 
Size 
A fasting blood sample for lipid and metabolic panels as well as HbA1c is to be collected. 
Subjects are to fast overnight for at least 9 hours prior to collection of the fasting sample (water 
is permissible).  
The following parameters are to be determined:  
• Lipid Panel : LDL -C, vLDL (very low density lipoprotein cholesterol) , high density 
lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL -C), non –HDL -C, total cholesterol, triglycerides , 
apolipoprotein B (ApoB ), and lipoprotein (a) ( Lp[a]) particles . 
• Metabolic Panel : Insulin and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA ). Homeostatic model 
assessment insulin resistance (HOMA -IR) and adipose tissue insulin resistance index 
(adipo -IR) are to be calculated from fasting insulin, fasting glucose  (see Section  12.1.5 ), 
and fasting NEFA, as applicable . An analysis of bile acid will also be performed at 
Baseline, Week 26, Week 52, and/or at Early Termination.

11.1.9.  Metabolic and Microbiome Substud y 
A metabolic and microbiome substudy will be performed at a subset of sites.  
Stool samples will be collected  from participating subjects  and used for exploratory analyses of 
gut microbiome composition during the study. Those s ubjects will also complete the Hep Vita 
Nutritional Survey. This nutritional survey tool uses scientifically validated dietary analysis 
software that provides the equivalent of 90 days of nutrition tracking in a survey that requires 
approximately 30 minutes  to complete ( HepVita web site, 2021 ). 
Provision of stool samples and completion of the nutritional survey for the metabolic and 
microbiome substudy is voluntary.  
11.2. Other Assessments  
11.2.1.  Genomics  
A blood sample for genomics pertaining to NASH will be collected at Baseline , or at any other 
time after the subject  signs the separate consent for this sample, at all sites unless forbidden by 
[CONTACT_427] . Subjects will be asked to provide separate written informed consent for the 
collection of such samples.  Genomic a nalysis will investigate  only the presence of SNPs 
associated with NASH, T2D M, or related diseases. Broad genome analysis  will not be 
performed. The laboratory platform to be used will  depend  upon advances in the genomic 
signature [CONTACT_775713] . 
Provision of blood samples for genomic analysis  is voluntary .

erythema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, asterixis) also are to be assessed.  
During Screening , the physical examination is to include measurement of height (cm).  
Symptom -directed physical examinations, including assessment of focused liver signs ( e.g., 
jaundice, spi[INVESTIGATOR_278310], palmar erythema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, asterixis ), skin, and 
extremities, will be conducted  to address any complaints or concerns verbalized by [CONTACT_775698].  
If hand -foot symptoms/signs present during the study, or previous hand/foot symptoms/signs 
increase in severity  to a Grade [ADDRESS_1065403] consult should be considered for 
further evaluation and treatment recommendations.  
Any abnormal physical examination finding  which, in the Investigator’s judgement, is  of clinical 
significance, is to be documented as an AE. 
Medical photographic images may be requested to document certain AEs such as hand -foot 
symptoms/signs or hair thinning. Complete anonymity is impossible, but the minimum possible 
area of the body should be photographed. Eyes should only be included when absolutely 
essential. Recognizable tattoos and birthmarks should be avoided in the frame. Identifiable

12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including abnormal laboratory findi ngs), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product.   
AEs also include the following:  
• Complications that occur as a result of a protocol -mandated procedure ( e.g., 
venipuncture, biopsy) . 
• Any pre -existing condition that increases in severity, or changes in nature during the 
study or as a consequence of the study treatment . 
• Complications and termination of pregnancy (see Section  12.2.6  for additional 
information) . 
• Any symptom  (e.g., myalgia,  fever ), physical  examination  finding , or clinical  syndrome  
(e.g., coryzal  illness ) that occurs  as a result  of infection  and/or  following  COVID -19 
vaccination  and is believed  by [CONTACT_775703].  (Further  details  for EDC  update  are contained  within  the EDC  completion  
guidelines.)  
Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  75 of 97 
Protocol SB2640 -CLIN -007 
 
 Version 4.0  An unexpected AE is any event for which the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
information in the current Investigator’s Brochure.  
All A Es that occur from Screening  (i.e., after the informed consent form [ ICF] is signed) through  
[ADDRESS_1065406] dose of study drug , whether or not they are related to the study drug, are to 
be reported in the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study 
period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered A Es if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected manner during the study ( e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
Additional exclusions to SAE reporting include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
Elective procedures  that are planned at the time of signing the informed consent .

 Version 4.0  12.2.2.  Adverse Event Assessment  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Intensity  
The intensity of each AE is to be assessed by [CONTACT_278341] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  (see 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_5x7.pdf ). If the AE is not included in the NCI CTCAE, then the Investigator is to  
determine the intensity of the AE according to the following criteria:  
Mild (Grade 1):  AE that disappears or is easily tolerated on continuation of study 
drug.  
Moderate (Grade 2):  AE sufficiently discomforting to cause interference with usual 
work activities.  
Severe (Grade  3): AE that is incapacitating, with inability to work or perform daily 
activities.  
Life-Threatening (Grade 4):  AE that is potentially  life-threatening.1 
Death (Grade 5):  Death related to AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to Study Drug  
The causal relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by [CONTACT_278342], as follows:  
Definitely related : This category applies when, after careful medical consideration, 
there is almost no consideration of other causation.  
Probably related : There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the 
AE and study drug administration. The AE is unlikely to be 
caused by a concurrent and/or underlying illness, other drugs, or 
procedures. If applicable, the AE follows a clinically consist ent 
resolution pattern upon withdrawal of study drug.  
Possibly related : There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the 
AE and study drug administration, but the AE could also have 
been caused by [CONTACT_775704]/or underlying illness, other 
drugs, or procedures. Information regarding study drug 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. “Possible” should be used 
when study drug administration is one of several biologically 
plausible causes of the AE.  
 
1. If a life -threatening (Grade  4) adverse event is immediately  life-threatening, the event is, by 
[CONTACT_108], serious and is to be reported as described in Section  12.2.4 . 
Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  77 of 97 
Protocol SB2640 -CLIN -007 
 
 Version 4.0  Unlikely related : The AE is most likely due to a non -study drug -related cause. 
However, association with the study drug cannot be completely 
ruled out.  
Unrelated : Another cause of the AE is most plausible , and a clinically 
plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the 
AE and study drug administration and/or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible.  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and study drug is determined to be “possible”, 
“probable”, or “definite”, the event will be considered to be treatment -related for the purposes of 
expedited regulatory reporting and safety analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Seriousness  
AEs that meet the criteria specified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  are to be considered serious.  
12.2.3.  Recording Adverse Events  
Each subject must be carefully monitored for the development of any A Es. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non -leading questions ( e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and from 
signs and symptoms detected during each physical examination, observations on the part of study 
personnel, and spontaneous reports from subjects.  
All A Es (serious and non -serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures will be documented in the subject’s source docume nts and recorded in the 
eCRF. Any clinically relevant (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) deterioration in laboratory 
assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded in the subject’s 
source documents and in the eCRF.  
Information about A Es will be collected from Screening  (i.e., after the ICF is signed) through 
[ADDRESS_1065408] medical 
terminology when possible . Also , when possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event . For each AE, the Investigator  
will evaluate and report the onset date, resolution date, intensity, causality, action taken, serious 
outcome (if applicable), and whether or  not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study .  
12.2.4.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and u nrelated) occurring from Screening  through [ADDRESS_1065409] report all SAEs within 24  hours of discovery via the EDC system, which 
will trigger email notifications to the Syneos Health , Medical Monitor/Safety team. In the event 
the EDC system is not available, then SAE reports must be emailed : 
 
 

Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  [ADDRESS_1065410] to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator 
suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported.  
12.2.7.  Overdose  of TVB -2640  
Signs and symptoms of an overdose should be reported as AEs. Overdoses will not be considered 
SAEs unless the outcome of the overdose meets seriousness criteria (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
12.2.8.  Protocol Deviations Due to an Emergency or Adverse Event  
Departures from the protocol will be determined as allowable on a case -by-case basis and only in 
the event of an emergency . The Investigator  or other physician in attendance in such an 
emergency must contact [CONTACT_278343].  
The CRO’s Medical Monitor, in conjunction with the Investigator , will decide whether the 
subject  should continue to participate in the study . All protocol deviations and reasons for such 
deviations must be documented in the  subject’s source records.

 Version 4.0  13. STATISTIC AL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1. Statistical General Considerations  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -design study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of TVB -2640 compared with matching placebo in subjects with 
NASH.  
For “c hange from Baseline ” and “percent change from Baseline” calculations, “ Baseline” refers 
to the last measurement obtained prior to the first administration of study drug. Study Day [ADDRESS_1065411] day of study treatment ( TVB -2640 50 mg  or placebo ). Demographic data (including age, 
race, ethnicity, sex, height, and weight), medical history, prior treatments, pretreatment clinical 
characteristics , and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_37821] .  
Descriptive statistics will be displayed by [CONTACT_775705] F2 -F3, for all subjects with liver fibrosis stage F1 -F3, and for all subjects, as appropriate, to 
provide an overview of the study results. As appropriate, d escriptive statistics will also be 
displayed by [CONTACT_775706] . For categorical parameters, the number 
and percentage of subjects in each category will be presented in data summaries. The 
denominators for percentages will be based on the number of subjects (n) appropriate for 
analysis. Continuous variables will genera lly be summarized based on  the following: n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and standard error of the mean. Categorical 
data will be summarized using frequency tabulations (number and percentage of subjects).  
Demographics and Baseline characteristics (medical histories, physical examinations, and 
concomitant medications) will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous 
variables and frequency distributions for discrete variables. Study subjects wh o discontinue the 
study along with reasons for discontinuation will be summarized and listed. Confidence intervals 
with be at the 90% and 95% level s. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS v9.4 . 
13.2. Efficacy Analysis  
13.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects experiencing either a histological 
improvement at Week 52 in NAS (i.e., ≥2-point  improvement  in NAS with 1 -point improvement 
in ballooning or inflammation) and without worsening of fibrosis score  (by [CONTACT_775660]) , OR resolution of steatohepatitis and no worsening of liver fibrosis (by [CONTACT_775648] ). Resolution of steatohepatitis is defined as absence of fatty liver disease or 
isolated or simple steatosis without steatohepatitis and a NAS of [ADDRESS_1065412] a posttreatment biopsy.  
The principal analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be based on the Intention -to-Treat 
(ITT) analysis set  (Section  13.4.2 ). The treatment groups will be compared based on the primary 
efficacy endpoint using a one-sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test  stratified by [CONTACT_775707] T2DM status (yes or no), region (North America  or not North 
Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  81 of 97 
Protocol SB2640 -CLIN -007 
 
 Version 4.0  America ), and amount of fibrosis  (F2 or F3) at the 0.05 significance level  (where a higher 
responder proportion is a better outcome ). A Clopper -Pearson 90% and 95% CI will be derived , 
and the odds ratio (with its 90% and 95% CI , using the control group  as a reference group ) will 
be produced to assess the treatment effect magnitude.  
Evaluation of t he robustness of the principal analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint  will be 
carried out using a logistic regression with response  as a dependent variable ; treatment group , 
randomization stratification factor s (T2DM status [yes or no], region [North America  or not 
North America ], and amount of fibrosis  [F2 or F3]) as independent factors ; and age as a baseline 
covariate . Other b aseline covariates and other adjustment factors will be prespecified in the 
statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be repeated for 
the modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT ) population (Section 13.4.2 ) to ascertain any changes in 
the conclusion of the principal analysis findings.  
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint  will be performed to assess whether the 
treatment effect is concordant among subgroups. The planned subgroup analyses are based on 
age category (<40 years, 40 to <65 years, and ≥65 years)  and race ( White, Black, Asian, and 
other).  
A subject who discontinues treatment prior to Week 4 2, does not provide a histological 
assessment on or after Week 4 2, or who otherwise has missing data will be considered a non -
responder.  
Further sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will employ multiple imputations for 
binary data. Pertinent details are included in the SAP.  
13.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are:

13.3. Safety Analysis  
Safety data will be evaluated for the Safety population (Section 13.4.2 ) on the basis of TEAEs, 
clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECGs, weight , and physical examinations. Changes 
from Baseline in key clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, physical examinations, and

defined as an AE that was not present prior to treatment with study drug but appeared following 
treatment or was present at treatment initiation but worsened during treatment. All AEs will be 
coded by [CONTACT_775708] (MedDRA ; 
current version ) and NCI  CTCAE (current version ) grading.  
TEAE incidence rates will be summarized using frequency and percentage for each treatment 
group  and in total. TEAEs through [ADDRESS_1065414] dose of study treatment will be

be summarized by [CONTACT_775709] (attribution to study treatment, 
related/not related to investigational medicinal product). Grades [ADDRESS_1065415] compliance and tolerability ratings will be summarized 
descriptively for each treatment group .  
All safety data will be presented in data listings.  
13.4. Statistical and Analytical Methods  
13.4.1  Hypothesis Testing  
The study primary hypothesis is the (statistical) one-sided superiority of a TVB -2640 50 -mg 
dose over placebo based on the primary efficacy endpoint  at the 0.05 significance level , where a 
higher responder proportion is a better outcome . The statistical analysis (one -sided) test (CMH) 
of the primary hypothesis is declared if p<0.05.  
Mathematically, the null and alternative hypothes es for the primary efficacy endpoint are stated 
as: 
Ho: p T ≤ pp 
Ha: p T > pp 
Here, pT is the proportion of responders in the TVB -[ADDRESS_1065416].  
13.4.2  Analysis Sets  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intent ion-to-Treat Population  
The principal analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on the 
Intention -to-Treat (ITT)  population , which comprises all randomized subjects ; this population 
will serve as the basis for all efficacy analyses.  Subjects ’ data  will be analyzed according to the ir 
randomized treatment assignment.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Modified Intention -to-Treat Population s 
Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT): Comprises all subjects in the ITT population who have 
completed at least [ADDRESS_1065417] an evaluable posttreatment histological 
assessment.  Interim Analys es Modified Intention -to-Treat Population  
Modified Intention -to-treat (IAmITT): Comprises a subset of subjects in the ITT population  with 
8% >/= MRI -PDFF at screening or at baseline  with at least [ADDRESS_1065418] dose of 
study drug.

 Version 4.0  [IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Population  
The Safety population will consist of all randomized  subjects  who receive d at least 1 dose 
(partial or complete) of study drug. This population will be used for all summaries of subject  
accountability, demographic and baseline data, and safety information, including AE incidence, 
clinical laboratory data , ECG data, and vital  signs data . Subjects ’ data  will be summarized 
according to the treatment they received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic Population  
The PK population will comprise all ITT subjects with available PK measurements.  
13.5. Power Considerations and Sample Size Determination  
The study is powered to test the one -sided (statistical) superiority hypothesis stipulating that a 
TVB -2640 50 -mg dose provides better benefi t than placebo  based on the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The study estimated total sample size is approximately 162 randomized subjects (10 8 
on TVB -2640 and 54 on placebo ). The sample size was derived using the normal approximation 
to the binomial distribution, and the estimated power to detect a difference in the primary 
efficacy response of 20% (TVB -2640 40% and placeb o 20% at Week 52) was at least 80% (one -
sided test at the 0.05 significance level). A 2 -to-1 randomization allocation was assumed (TVB -
2640 to placebo ), and an anticipated dropout rate of 18.5% was also applied to estimate the final 
total sample size (N=162).  
13.6. Interim Analysis  
A single (secondary endpoint) efficacy interim analys is is planned when approximately 60 
subjects with an MRI -PDFF value of ≥8% liver fat at Baseline  have completed Week 26 or an 
Early Termination visit after Week  22. The purpose of the proposed interim analys is is to 
examine the TVB -2640 benefit over placebo based on a Week 26 secondary efficacy endpoint 
consisting of “proportion of MRI -PDFF ≥30% responders,  where an MRI -PDFF ≥30% 
responder is defined as a subject with ≥8% liver fat content at Baseline who achi eves a percent 
change (reduction) from Baseline in MRI -PDFF ≥30%.”  
Interim safety summaries will accompany the interim analyses of the secondary efficacy 
endpoint.   
An interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint  is not feasible since the primary endpoint is 
only evaluated at Week 52, and not Week 26 . Therefore, a statistical penalty is not envisaged in 
conjunction with the Week 26 interim analysis of the above -stated secondary endpoint. Interim 
summaries of safety and selected biomarker data will accompany the interim efficacy analysis of 
the secondary efficacy endpoint.  
13.7. Planned Study Committees  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be established by [CONTACT_775657] a 
systematic manner to safeguard the safety of study subjects. Periodic meetings will occur as 
outlined in the IDMC charter. An interim analysis, which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_31849], will be 
performed when approximately  60 subjects with an MRI -PDFF value  of ≥8% liver fat  at 
Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  [ADDRESS_1065419]

protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sagimet Biosciences  or its representatives . 
This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Sagimet Biosciences  
and the Investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sagimet Biosciences  or designee will have regular contacts 
with the  study center , for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s) . 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable . 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol that  data are being 
accurately recorded in the  source documents and eCRFs , and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed . 
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the subject ’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant to 
the study . This will require direct access to all original records for each subject  (e.g., 
clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to  Sagimet Biosciences.  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs h ave been properly documented in the e CRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to  the Sponsor or designee,  and those SAEs that met criteria 
for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB/IEC . 
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
15.2. Case Report Form Completion  
The Sponsor or designee will provide the study centers with eCRFs for each subject.  
eCRFs will be completed for each study subject. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure 
the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s eCRF. Source 
documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subje ct’s participation in the study 
and should document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, and subject status.  
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a subject is seen for an 
Sagimet Biosciences  Confidential  [ADDRESS_1065422] electronically sign and date the Investigator’s Statement at the end of the 
eCRF to endorse the recorded data.  
15.3. Computerized Systems/Medical Records as Source Data  
All study data recorded on source documents are to be transcribed into the eCRFs.  
Clinical data will be entered by [CONTACT_240488]. Data on 
eCRFs transmitted via the web -based data system must correspond to and be supported by [CONTACT_190394].   
All study forms and records transmitted to the Sponsor must only include coded identifiers such 
that directly identifying personal information is not transmitted. The primary method of data 
transmittal is via the secure, internet -based EDC system maintaine d by [CONTACT_144175]. Access to 
the EDC system is available only to authorized users via the study’s internet website, where a 
user unique assigned username [CONTACT_190448].  
Any changes made to data after collection will be made through use of the EDC system.  
eCRFs will be considered complete when all missing and/or incorrect data have been resolved.  
15.4. Source Documents  
Source documents are considered to be ‘all information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_163503], observations, data, or other activities in a clinical study 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study ’. The Investigator will provide direct 
access to source documents and/or source data in the facilitation of trial -related monitoring, 
audits, review by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC , and regulatory inspections.  
The Investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial 
records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects. Source data 
should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate,  and complete. Changes to 
source data should be traceable, not obscure the original entry, and be explained where 
necessary.  
15.5. Retention of Records  
The Investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirement(s) . Study records and source documents must be preserved for at least 15 years after 
the completion or discontinuation of/withdrawal from the study, and at least [ADDRESS_1065423] or according to applicable regulatory requirement(s) .  
If the Investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], custody must 
be transferred to a person willing to accept that responsibility . The Sponsor must be notified 
immediately by [CONTACT_16062] e -mail and the notification confirmed  in writing if a custodial 
change occurs.

 Version 4.0  15.6. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Sagimet Biosciences or designee, a regulatory authority, or 
IRB/IEC  may visit the study center to perform audits or inspections, including source data 
verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently 
examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these act ivities were 
conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, 
ICH GCP, and any applicable regulatory requirement s. 
The Investigator  should contact  [CONTACT_775710] a

 Version 4.0  APPENDIX  A. ALGORITHM FOR EVALUATING SUBJECTS  FOR 
POTENTIAL DRUG -INDUCED LIVER INJURY  
During the  study , aminotransferase elevations are to be managed as follows : 
1. Isolated aminotransferase elevation ( i.e., total bilirubin - normal):  
ALT or AST  Event during the study  Action  
Baseline  ALT and AST within 
normal range  Increase ≥5 × ULN  Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, 
bilirubin ) and PT/INR within 
[ADDRESS_1065432]  as 
per “close observation” 
definition* in the DILI guidance.  ALT or AST above normal 
range at Baseline  Increase ≥3 × Baseline result, 
but no liver related symptoms  
(e.g., anorexia, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain , 
pruritus, cholestasis ) 
ALT or AST above normal 
range at Baseline  Increase ≥3x Baseline  result, and  
subject  experiences liver - related 
symptoms ( e.g., anorexia, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain , pruritus, 
cholestasis ) Interrupt study drug  for at least 
15 days . Initiate potential DILI 
evaluation for alternative 
etiologies , and repeat liver 
profile and PT/INR within [ADDRESS_1065433]  under “close 
observation” as defined in the 
DILI guidance.  
Abbreviations: ALP  = alkaline phosphatase: ALT  = alanine aminotransferase; AST  = aspartate 
aminotransferase: DILI  = drug-induced liver injury; GGT  = gamma -glutamyltransferase; 
INR = international normalized ratio; PT  = prothrombin time;  ULN  = upper limit of normal.   
*Close observation as defined in the FDA DILI guidance (i.e., laboratory testing and physical examination 
2 to 3 times per week. Study drug is to be restarted only if a firm alternative etiology is “identified” and 
the liver tests return to ‘ baseline’ levels ). 
 
Note the following:  
The ‘baseline’ result for any laboratory parameter is the average of the Screening visit result, the 
Day 1 visit result and any unscheduled visit that occurred during the Screening period.’  
Study drug interruption refers to cessation of study drug intake, but with the possibility that 
intake may re -start at a later date if certain requirements described in this appendix  are 
confirmed.  
Conversely, study drug discontinuation refers to cessation of study drug intake and without the 
possibility that intake may restart at a later date. However, such a subject  should remain in the 
study, continue to undergo ‘close observation’ where required, and other scheduled study 
assessments.  
If a subject  sustains a liver test elevation but remains eligible to continue study drug intake in 
parallel with ‘close observation’, and ‘close observation’ is not possible then study drug intake 
should be interrupted until it is possible for the subject  to undergo further assessment.

Protocol SB2640 -CLIN -007 
 
 Version 4.0  Close observation as defined in the FDA DILI guidance i.e., laboratory testing and physical 
examination 2  to 3 times per week. Study drug is to be restarted only if a firm alternative 
etiology is “identified” and the liver tests return to ‘baseline ’ levels . 
 
2. Elevation of aminotransferase and total bilirubin or cholestatic liver test markers:  
Analyte  Event during the study  Action  
TB + AST or ALT  ↑ TB >2 mg/dL  
and 
↑ ALT or ALT ≥3 × Baseline or 
5 × ULN (whichever comes 
first)  Interrupt study drug  for at least 
15 days.  
Initiate potential DILI evaluation 
for alternative etiologies.  
Repeat liver profile and PT/INR 
within [ADDRESS_1065434]  under 
“close observation” as defined in 
the DILI guidance.  
Study drug can be re -started only 
if a firm competing etiology is 
identified and the liver tests 
return to Baseline levels.  TB, ALP, or GGT  ↑ TB >2 mg/dL  
and 
ALP or GGT ↑ >2 × ULN  
TB OR INR + symptoms 
(regardless of any magnitude 
AST/ALT elevation)  Elevation ↑ TB >2 mg/dL  
OR 
INR ≥1.5  
and  
Indicators of immunological 
reaction ( i.e., rash or >5% 
eosinophilia), or appearance of 
liver-related symptoms, e.g., 
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain , pruritus, 
cholestasis.   Permanently d iscontinue study 
drug.  
Initiate potential DILI evaluation 
for alternative etiologies.  
Repeat liver profile and PT/INR 
within [ADDRESS_1065435]  under 
“close observation” as defined in 
the DILI guidance . 
Abbreviations: ALP  = alkaline phosphatase: ALT  = alanine aminotransferase; AST  = aspartate 
aminotransferase: DILI  = drug-induced liver injury; GGT  = gamma -glutamyltransferase; 
INR = international normalized ratio; PT = prothrombin time; TB  = total bilirubin; ULN  = upper limit of 
normal.  
 
Note the following:  
If a subject lives in a remote area, they can be tested using a local (‘non -central’ ) laboratory, with 
the results communicated to the Investigator promptly.  
For subjects with Gilbert’s syndrome, a doubling of direct bilirubin concentration instead of total 
bilirubin concentration should be used for close monitoring and TVB -[ADDRESS_1065436] 
be followed until the clinical and laboratory abnormalities stabilize or normalize:  
• In the presence of total bilirubin elevation (>2 × ULN or >1.5 × Baseline level); with 
any degree of aminotransferase elevation; AND if there is appearance of symptoms 
i.e., fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, 
and/or eosinophilia (>5%).  
• If any total bilirubin, ALT, or AST elevation above the subject ’s Baseline result 
recurs following rechallenge with study drug.

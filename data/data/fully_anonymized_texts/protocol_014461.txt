Amendment 01 10-SEP -2018
Original Protocol 22-JUN -2017
Amendment 0110-SEP-2018
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
Following scientific advice from regulatory  agencies , a much faster study  recruitment 
time than expected and a much lower than expected subject dropout rate, [COMPANY_004] have 
reassessed the rationale for the planned interim analy sisand sample size r e-estimation , 
which was planned for the s tudy. The primary  aim of this amendment is to remove the 
current requirement to perform the interim analy sisand an y subsequent need to include 
further subjects that followed that.
Also, the Benefit/Risk Assessment section has been amended to align with the updated 
EU-RMP .
Some other text changes to clarify  protocol have been made as well as typographical 
corrections throughout.

91. SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: An open label, randomised, parallel group clinical study  to evaluate the 
effect of the Connected Inhaler Sy stem (CI S) on adherence to Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA 
therap y, in asthmatic subjects with poor control
Short Title: A clinical study  to evaluate the effect of the Connected Inhaler Sy stem (CI S) 
on adherence to maintenance therap y in poorl y controlled asthmatic patients
Rationale: This study  will be the first to evaluate the effect of the CIS on adherence to 
maintenance therap y (Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA ) in uncontro lled asthmatic patients (A sthma 
Control Test [A CT]<20at the screening vi sit and ACT <20 at a subsequent 
randomisation visit following run in)
The study  has been designed to assess how the CIS impacts adherence, of asthmatic 
patients, to maintenance therap y, when both the subject and the healthcare professional 
(HCP )receive da ta from the sensor on the patient’s Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA maintenance 
therap y. 
In addition, the five treatment arms of the stud y will allow evaluation of different 
elements of the CIS including, having additional data provided from a sensor on rescue 
medica tion and also the effect of the patient alone seeing an y data with no data shared to 
the HCP, or  both the patient and HCP, seeing the data from the sensors Furthermore, this 
study  will provide preliminary  data evaluating the effect of the CIS on patient o utcomes, 
including rescue medication use , patient reported outcomes and change in asthma control 
as assessed b y the Asthma Control Test (ACT) .

173. INTRODUCTION
[COMPANY_004] has, in co llaboration with Propeller Health, developed a sensor which clips on to the 
ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) , herein referred to as ELLIPTA . The sensor will 
measure when the ELLIPTA mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_616631] , via an application (app) on a smart phone to the patient . This will inform 
a patient if/when a dose of Relvar /Breo has been actuated from the ELLIPTA . Other 
information, including: asthma management strategies, tracking of s ymptoms, asthma 
triggers, medi cation reminders and daily asthma forecasts involving weather and air 
quality  data ,will also be provided via the app. Information from a second sensor on a 
patient’s rescue medication metered dose inhaler (MDI) c ould also provide feedback, via 
the app, to the patient on their salbutamol (albuterol) MDI use. The data from both 
Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA and salbutamol MDI can also be shared, via an online dashboard, 
with the patient’s Health Care Professional ( HCP ), see Figure 1and Prope ller Sy stem 
Site Manual (PSSM) . The sensors, app, dashboard and systems to provide data are
subsequently  described as the Connected Inhaler Sy stem (CI S).
Figure [ADDRESS_817536] of the CI S on adherence to maintenance 
therap y (Relvar/Breo E LLIPTA ) in uncontrolled asthmatic patient s (Asthma Control Test 
[ACT ]<20at the screening visi t and ACT <20 at a subsequent randomisation visit after 
run-in).The run -in exists to ensure a stable level of control prior to entry  into the study , 
given the possible change in treatment andis described in detail in Section 5.1.
The study  has been designed to assess how the CIS impacts adherence of asthmatic 
patients to maintenance therap y,when both the subject and the HCP receive data on 
adherence from thesensor on the patient’s Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA maintenance therapy . 
In addition ,thefive treatment arms of the stud y will allow evaluation of different 
elements of the CIS . These include; having additional data provided from a sensor on

[ADDRESS_817537] and patient reported outcomes (PROs) .
3.2. Background
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory  disease of the airway s that results in hy perreactivity  
and clinically  relevant epi[INVESTIGATOR_228768], chest tightness and cou ghing. Although 
asthmatic sy mptoms can normally  be controlled, by  [CONTACT_3148], it remains a serious 
condition that is associated with a number of different impacts and co-morbidities such 
as; fatigue, activity  impairment , psy chological problems (anxiety , dep ression and stress), 
lung infections and delays in growth (paediatrics). 
The underl ying path ophysiology  of asthma includes epi[INVESTIGATOR_616632], smooth muscle 
contr action, bronchial hyperreactivity and airway inflammation [Koterba , 2012 ]. 
Depending on the asthmatic patient, these s ymptoms can become worse during the 
evening and/or with exercise [ Martinez , 2007 ]. Asthma is believed to affect the lives of 
approximately  [ADDRESS_817538] [ GINA,2017]. Also, a s asthma is an inflammatory  condition that is 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_616633], patients can exhibit symptomatic adherence to maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
[Anarella , 2004 ]. 
Inadequate control of asthma sy mptoms continues to be a serious problem, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_616634], adherence rates remain less 
than optimum [Anarella ,2004 , Foster ,2014 ]. The significance of adherence to treatment 
regimens in the management of asthma is becoming ever more evident. Avariet y of 
studies have indicated that poor adherence to maintenance therap y is intimately 
associated with reduced quali ty of life and, increased ;asthma sy mptoms, oral steroid 
usage, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_616635]  [Patel , 2013; Williams , 2011, Normansell ,2017]. 
Furthermore, reduced adherence to ma intenance therapy  can lead to an overuse of rescue 
medication, which has been linked to poorer health status [ Patel ,2013]. 
Due to the chronic nat ure of the disease ,lowadherence rates are recognised as oneof the 
maincontributing factors to reduced control among stasthmatic patients. Therefore, the 
requirement for routine and habitual use of maintenance therap y is paramount. 
Currently , determination of inherent adherence rates are questionable due to their largel y
subjective (patient diaries), unreliable (prescription refills) and imprecise (dosage 
counters) data acquisition methodologies . Each of these methods can misrepresent what 
is occurring in the real world. Furthermore, clinicians’ estimations of adherence rates can
be inaccurate, patient self -reported adherence rates are notoriousl y overestimated and 
some electronic dose counters can also beproblematic due to dose dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [ Bae,2009 ; 
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
19Zeller , 2008 ]. Because of these uncertainties, there is an abundance of research being 
undertaken in the area of inhaler sensors for adherence. Novel solutions to some of the 
aforementioned problems are currentl y in development, such as; actuation switches ( e.g.
Smarti nhaler and Propeller Health MDI sensor ) for time stampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], heated thermistors 
(MDI log) for inhalation detection, microphones (INCA Device) for detecting peak 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_616636], accelerometers (Amiko and MDI Log) for time 
stampi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] t echnique feedback, and light transmitters (SmartTrack and SmartTouch) 
for detection of canister depression and time stampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Dosing regimens (once daily  vs. twice daily ) have also unsurprisingl y been found to have 
an effect on adherence to maintenance th erapy.  Fewer doses required on a daily  basis as 
part of maintenance therapy , has been shown to increase adherence rates aswell as 
creating amore routine and habitual dosing times [ Coleman , 2012 ]. 
It has bee n shown that the addition of a sensor which has the ability  to feedback 
information is associated with increased adherence rates in paediatric patients of between 
30 and 50% [ Chan , 2016 ; Foster , 2014 ]. Unfortunately , the population (paediatrics) and 
the inherent variability  of the data make interpretation and extrapolation to other 
populations problematic. However, a20-30% increase in adherence rates when using 
inhaled corticosteroids has been shown to lead to clinically  relevant effects ,such as, a 
reduction in exacerbations [ Williams ,2011 ].Whilst many  studies have used sensors to 
measure adherence, relatively  few studies have assessed the influence of sensors on 
adherence rates and even less information exists to demonstrate the link between 
adherence and clinicall y relevant outcomes or patient reported quality  of life.
Adherence rate measurements should be unobtrusive, ob jective and accurate, in order to 
correctly  identify  innate patient adherence rates [ Chan , 2015 ]. Accordingly, Propeller 
Health ,in collaboration with [COMPANY_004] ,has developed a sensor, which can clip onto any  
ELLIPT A DPI [INVESTIGATOR_616637] . The sensor can be detached and transferred to subsequent inhalers by  
[CONTACT_50246] . Propeller Health alread y produces a sensor that clips on to the top of a 
rescue MDI and records time and date of actuation. The data, from both of these sensors
can then be fed back to the patient or patient and their HealthCare Professional (HCP)
through the use of an a pp or dashboard . Patient/HCP interaction with the data through the 
app/dashboard may  enable greater engagement between the patie ntand their HCP 
regarding their asthma . The app associated with the Propell er Health sensor also provides 
information on asthma management strategies, tracking of s ymptoms, asthma triggers, 
medica tion reminders and daily  asthma forecasts involving weather and air quality  data, 
in order to improve a patients ’understanding of ,and relationship with ,their asthma.
It is believed that engaging apatient’s interest in their asthma could improve their 
adherenc e to their maintenance therap y and ultimately  improves their asthma outcomes 
as much of the research supports the importance of adherence rates to asthma control
[Sapir , 2017 ]. Therefore, if through the use of the CI S, a patien t can engage with their 
asthma , this may improve adherence andultimately  improve their level of asthma control. 
Furthermore, from a nHCP perspective, having accurate adherence data would make 
discussions with their patients more objective and informed when considering appropriate 
asthma management strategies .

For Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA , the following risks and the corresponding mitigation 
strateg ies,as applicable to asthma patie nts,were taken from the summary  of safet y 
concerns in the European Union –Risk Management Plan (EU -RMP Version 10 ). For 
Relvar/Breo the rationale for the risk assessment was derived from the 2014 -2016 
Investigator Brochures, from an integrated anal ysis of key  Relvar/Breo studies.

Pneumonia in patients 
withasthmaIn an integrated analysi s of 11 
studies in asthma (7034 patients), 
the incidence of pneumonia 
(adjusted for exposure, due to low 
numbers and limited number of 
patients on placebo) seen with 
FF/VI 100/25 microgram strength 
(9.6/1000 patient years) was similar 
to placebo (8.0/1000 patient years). 
The incidence was slightly higher
for FF/VI 200/25 microgram 
(18.4/1000 patient years). No risk 
factors were identified.
In HZA115150 (SLS Asthma) the 
number of subjects who 
experienced a Pneumonia SAESI 
was low. In total, 23 subjects (1%)
randomised to initiate treatment 
with FF/VI arm experienced 
24Pneumonia SAESIs, and 
16subjects (<1%) randomised to
continue usual care experienced 
18Pneumonia SAESIs.
The incidence rate of subjects 
experiencing a Pneumonia SAESI 
per [ADDRESS_817539] -years at risk by

The inciden ce ratio for Pneumonia

therefore, being randomised to

Serious cardiovascular 
eventsIn an analysis performed on the [ADDRESS_817541] been 
reported in patients exposed to 
FF/VI. Seven events in FF/VI 
100/25 and one event in FF/VI 
200/25. This represents an 
incidence less than 1% in the 
asthmatic patients exposed to 
FF/VI. a
The events reported include atrial 
fibrillation, acute coronary 
syndrome, coronary artery disease, 
hypertension, myocardial ischemia, 
tachyarrhythmia and tachycardia.
Therefore, fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol should be used 
with caution in patients with severe

predisposed to low levels of serum 
potassium.Subject s with existing serious

from the study.
Investigators are made aware of 
the potential class effects of 
LABAs and are advised to 
exercise caution for subjects with 
existing serious cardiovascular 
disease (Section 6.3 [Warnings

Decreased bone mineral 
density and associated 
fracturesRisk of fracture has been 
associated with oral cor ticosteroids. 
It is unclear if inhaled 
corticosteroids carry the same risk. 
Currently the risk of reduced bone 
mineral density has not been 
observed in the asthma population 
[Jones , 2002 ]. In addition specific
assessments in adolescents with 
asthma have not demonstrated an Subject s will be informed about 
the risk of decreased bone

ICS. Preclinical studies showed FF 
at high dose compara ble to other 
high dose corticosteroids. In study 
HZA106839 (FF/VI, FF and FP in 
subject s with asthma), formal 
ophthalmic assessments were 
conducted (including lens opacities 
classification system [ LOCS ]III 
evaluations for ocular opacities) 
throughout the study. This study 
showed no apparent effects on lens 
opacification, compared to 
baseline. During studies in both 
subject s with asthma and COPD, 
no associated affect on ocular 
disorders was observed.Subject s will be informed about 
the risk of corticosteroi d

Benefit Assessment .
As a re sult of switching from other prescribed ICS/L ABA combination products and 
being randomised to a treatment arm in the study , subjects may  switch from an inhaled 
therap y that is taken twice daily , to a once daily  therapy  (Relvar/Breo) t he patients in this 
study may  have better adherence and sopossibl y better asthma control .There is also a 
potential benefit from use of the CIS. This has the potential to increase their adherence
through interaction with the data ou tputs and engagement with their asthma . Data with 
marketed products suggests that adherence improves with less frequent 
administration /simplification of therap y and therefore it is expected that a once -daily 
treatment could improve adherence , which may  lead to improvements in disease control 
and redu ctions in healthcare resource utilisation costs [Foster , 2014 , Price ,2010, Toy,
2011 ].
3.3.2. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) has ass essed this study  for any  potential risks that a subject may  
experience. The investigational product (IP) FF/VI will be used as is detailed in the 
prescribing information and has an acceptable safety  profile for clinical use and there are 
no significant ass ociated risks. This conclusion is supported by  [CONTACT_424357] y 
performed clinical studies with the products in healthy  volunteers and subjects with 
Asthma and COPD and post -marketing experience (see local label).
There is a small risk of destabi lising asthma when switch ingto Relvar/ Breo. Patients will 
be provided with rescue medication and will be educated to recognise s ymptoms of 
asthma worsening and instructed to contact [CONTACT_616670].
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this
study , the potential risks identified , associated with FF/VI are justified by  [CONTACT_616671].

therap y.
The procedures to be performed at each visit are shown in Section 2.The study  and visits 
are described here.
At all visits will require subjects to withhold a daily  dose of mainten ance therapy  and 
rescue medication for 6 hours ;as some assessments will require th is restriction for 
validity  of the assessment (PEF and FeNO) and also so correct use can be demonstrated 
with that day s Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA dose at any required visit .
The treatment period for the study  is [ADDRESS_817554] could be on the study  for approximately  7, 8 or 9 months in total
Screening Visit (V 1)
Subjects who have provided their informed consent will be screened at Visit 1 (V1 ) for 
inclusion on the study . Subject s who meet all the inclusion c riteria, including an ACT of 
<20, will en ter the flexible run-inperiod. Screening and starting the flexible run-incan 
occur at the same visit, howe ver for logistical reasons the flexible run-incan start at a 
separate visit, which must be within [ADDRESS_817555] ’s 
inclusion on the study . Should a subject not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, they  
will be registered a s a screen failure.
Flexible Run -in
Following inclusion at screening all subjects will receive Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA DPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_616639] y and salbutamol MDI  rescue medication and be instructed to take 
these as prescribed. 
Instruction on correct use of th e Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA DPI  [INVESTIGATOR_616640], particularly  in the case of subject s previously  using other devices, and/or using 
medication requiring twice -daily dosing.
Both the Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA and salbutamol MDI medication used by  [CONTACT_616672] s 
included on the study  will have a sensor fitted and switched on at the clinic visit . 
However, during this run-inperiod, there will be no information provided to the subject s 
or HCPs on their adherence to Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA oron their use of salbutamol MDI . 
Subjects will also be instructed in fitting the sensors onto both the ELLIPTA and MDI.

study  treatment and have not withdrawn consent are encouraged to continue in the study  
and complete all remaining protocol specified clinic visits .  If a subject is withdrawn then
they should complete the assessment sas per Section 2. Reasons for withdrawal are 
provided in Section 8.2.
5.2. Number of Subject s
Approximately  [ADDRESS_817565] completed the study  if he/she has completed the last 
scheduled procedure shown in Section 2,including the follow up visit.
The end of the stud y is defined as the date that the last subject completes the last 
scheduled procedure shown in the Section 2.
5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study  Design
This study  will be an open label study , as it is not possible to blind the treatment arms to 
which sensors (maintenance or rescue) are providing feedback to the patient via the app, 
and also, w hether or not the patients’ HCP has access to this data via the dashboard.
A true control arm (no sensors on ELLIPTA or MDI) cannot be incorporated into the 
design.  A ll subject s need to have a sensor on their maintenance and rescue medication in 
order to consistentl y measure their adherence to maintenance and level of rescue 
medication use ; as other methods of measuring adherence and rescue medication use
(paper or electronic diaries and prescription refills) have inherent problems . Therefore, 
arm [ADDRESS_817566] possible match to normal current practise.
Any asthmatic patient who is currentl y uncontrolled (ACT<20) on their current
ICS/LABA medication may  be recruited and will ,as need ed,switch to Relvar/Breo 
ELLIPTA , if not alread y prescribed that . Due to this possible change in maintenance 
medication, a flexible run -in period has be en incorporated into the stud y design, to enable 
assessment of an y impact associated with the change of drug/dosing frequency ,or simply  
being on the study ,before being randomised to treatment on the study .
The [ADDRESS_817567] of data being 
provided from both maintenance and rescue med ications on adherence .
5.5. Dose Justification
Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA and Salbutamol MDI  will be prescribed as per label. The dosage 
of Relvar/Breo prescribed to a subject at the beginning of the stud y will depen don the 
dosage of the ir current ICS/L ABA treatment and therefore, whether they  will receive 
either 100/25 mcg or 200/25 mcg Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA .Changing between doses is 
permitted during the study treatment period if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093].

study  care of the subject’s medical condition, whether or not [COMPANY_004] is providing specific 
post-study  treatment.
Medic ations initiated after completion of the assessments at V10 or the EWvisit will not 
be recorded in the eCRF unless taken to treat an AE or asthma exacerbation. subject s who 
have completed the EWvisit are allowed to use any  medications prescribed by  [CONTACT_616678].
8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA
Subjects that permanently  stop study  treatment (any aspect of the CIS) areencouraged to 
remain in the study . Subject s have the right to discontinue study  treatment before the end 
of the study . A subject may also be asked to discontinue study  treatment at the 
investigator’s discretion.
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817581] s who withdraw from study  treatment prematurely  (for any  reason) should, where 
possible, continue to be followed -up as per protocol until the completion o f the Safet y 
Follow -up assessments. If patients want to discontinue use of the CIS but will continue 
taking the Relvar/B reoELLIPTA DPI [INVESTIGATOR_616647] -on sensor for ELLIPTA .If this is not 
possible, the I nvestigator must encourage the subject to participate in as much of the 
study  as they  are willing (or able) to. For those subjects who do not want to use the 
sensor during the study , their health outcome information will be c ollected along with 
any additional adherence data. Likewise, subjects who change their dose of Relvar/Breo 
(FF/VI) at the discretion of the investigator during the study  will be given the option to 
remain on the stud y, all information will continue to be c ollected for the duration of the 
study .However, subjects who permanently  discontinue from Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA 
should be withdrawn from the study .
A subject may be withdrawn from stud y treatment at any time. A reason for premature 
discontinuation of study  treatment must be captured in the eCRF.
8.1. Discontinuation of Study  Treatment
8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_616648] .  If however, the subject has a routine

8.3. Lost to Follow Up
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly  fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_56821]. 
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study  visit:
The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_147234]/or 
should continue in the study .
Before a subject is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must 
make every  effort to regain contac t with the subject (where possible, [ADDRESS_817583] ’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_225961] ’s medical record.
Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary  reason of lost to follow -up. 
9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summari sed in Section 2. 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed 
Immediate safety  concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately  upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discontinue study  
treatment.
Adherence to the stu dy design requirements, including those specified in the Section 2, is 
essential and required for study  conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
subject s meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all subject s screened and to confirm eligibility  or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable. 
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817584] ’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the inform ed consent form ( ICF)may be utilized 
for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified 
criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the Section 2.
9.1. Efficacy  Assessments
9.1.1. Primary ,Secondary  and Other A dherence Measures
The Primary , Secondary  and Other adherence endpoint ( adherence to maintenance 
medication ) data is collected by  [CONTACT_616680] -on Sensor for ELLIPTA and records the time 
and date when the ELLIPTA cover is opened and closed. 
The sensor will be attached to subjects ELLIPTA Relvar/Breo treatment from start of 
run-inuntil V10. Refer ences and material for fitting the sensor s, downloading the app 
and other aspects of using the CIS are included in the SRM.
9.1.2. Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS]. Asthma Control Test
This assessment is described in Section 9.1.3. 1and will be collecte d electronically  atthe

electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) device.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rescue Medic ation Use
Rescue Medication use endpoint data is collected by  [CONTACT_616681]. 
The sensor will be attached to the subject’s salbutamol MDI  treatment from start of run-
inuntil V10. Details for fitting the sensor and other aspects of using the CIS are included 
in the SRM.
9.1.3. Questionnaires and Interviews
It ispreferred that the questionnaires are administered at the same time of day  at each 
visit and that this time of day  is the same as when they  were originall y administered (as is 
feasible/appropriate), in order to avoid potential bias due to the time of day when 
responding. The subjects should not be told the results of any diagnostic tests prior to 
completing the questionnaires and the questionnaires should be completed before an y 
procedures are performed on the subject to avoid influencing the subject’s res ponse. 
Adequate time in a quiet, comfortable location must be allowed to complete all items on 
the questionnaires and if necessary , the subject must be encouraged to complete any
questio nnaires or missing items fully .Full guidance for obtaining good quali ty data from 
patient -completed questionnaires is included in the SRM .

questionnaires can be found in the SRM.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Asthma Control Test (A CT)
The ACT is a validated self -administered questionnaire utilising [ADDRESS_817585] 4 weeks on a 5 -point categorical scale (1 to 5) with a range
of [ADDRESS_817586]’s asthma is unlikely to be well controlled. A score of [ADDRESS_817587]’s asthma is likely  to be well controlled. The total score is 
calculated as the sum of the scores from all 5 questions [Nathan , 2004]. The minimally  
important difference (M ID) for ACT is 3 [ Schatz , 2009].
Subjects will complete the ACT at times shown in the Section 2using the electronic 
version on the ePRO device at the clinical site .
The ACT has been developed as a measure of su bjects’ asthma control that can be 
quickly  and easil y completed in clinical practice and by [CONTACT_756]. The questions are 
designed to be self -completed by  [CONTACT_423] . 
Please refer to the SRM for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Asthma Sy mptom Utility  Index (A SUI)
The ASU I is a 10 -item self -administered questionnaire with 4 questions on asthma 
symptoms (Cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, awakening at night) and 1 question about 
the side effects of asthma medications [Revicki , 1998] .  For each s ymptom, there are 2 
dimensions; frequency  and severit y.  The questionnaire is based on a 2 -week patient 
recall of s ymptoms with response options of 0 to 4 for frequency  (not at all, 1 to 3 day s, 4 
to 7 day s, and 8 to 14 day s)and severity (not applicable, mild, moderate and severe).
ASUI  will be completed on an ePRO device at the clinical study  site and at the times

[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient A ctivation Measure (PA M)
Patient Activation Measure will be used to assess the knowledge, skills and confidence a 
person has in managing their own health and health care. The questionnaire will be 
completed at the times shown in the Section 2.
The PAM contains a series of 13 statements designed to assess the extent of a patient’s 
activation. These statements are about beliefs, confidence in the man agement of health -
related tasks and self -assessed knowledge. Patients are asked to rate the degree to which 
they agree or disagree with each statement. These answers are combined to provide a 
single score of between 0 and 100, which represents the patients ’concept of themselves 
as an active manager of their health and health care. There is no specified timeframe on 
which responses should be based, the questionnaire is suitable to be used to measure 
changes in activation over time and can be performed befor e and after an intervention

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication A dherence Report Scale for A sthma (MA RS-A),10-item 
questionnaire
Reported adherence to medication will be assessed with the Medication Adherence 
Report Scale for Asthma (MARS -A) questionnaire at times shown in the Schedule of 
Activities (SoA) .
The MARS -A is a 10 -item questionnaire where medication use is rated on a 5 -point 
Likert scale (1 indicating ‘alway s’ to 5 indicating ‘never’). It has been validated as a self -
reported mea sure of adherence with I CS for patients with asthma ,and includes generic 
(“I use it regularl y ever y day”) and lung condition -specific questions about medication 
use (“I onl y use it when I feel breathless”) [Cohen , 2009]. The MARS -A hasno specified 
timeframe on which responses should be based but generall y refer to the present moment .
MARS -A will be completed on an ePRO device at the clinical study  site and at the times 
detailed in the Section 2.
Please r efer to the SRM for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Beliefs in Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ).
The BMQ questionnaire consists of the BMQ Specific, which measures perceptions of 
specific medicines, and the BMQ General, which measures more general beliefs about 
medicines. Al l items are rated on a 5 -point L ikert scale [Horne , 2002].
The BMQ General comprises a General Benefit scale, General Harm scale and a General 
Overuse scale assessing beliefs about pharmaceuticals as a class of treatm ent. The 
General Harm scale assesses beliefs about the intrinsic nature of medicines and the 
degree to which they  are perceived as harmful and should be avoided if possible. The 
General Overuse scale represents beliefs about the use of medicines and whethe r they  are 
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L

48overprescribed b y clinicians.  The BMQ Specific (Asthma) comprises two scales: one 
assessing patients' beliefs about the necessity  of preventer medication for maintaining 
present and future health (Necessity  scale), and the other assessing their concerns about 
the potential adverse consequences of using it (Concerns scale). Four items were added 
for use in patients with asthma .
BMQ will be completed on an ePRO device at the clinical study  site and at the times 
detailed in the Section 2.
Please refer to the SRM for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exit Questionnaire
All subjects will complete a questionnaire at the end of the final study  visit (V10) to 
assess the CI S.  This questionnaire is designed to understand thesubje ct’spercepti ons of 
the CI S. It i s self -completed on the ePRO device by [CONTACT_1766] .It includes questions 
relating to the concepts below:   
Overall s atisfaction with CIS
Parts of the CISthat were most /least helpful
Level of engagement with the CI S
Challenges/difficul ties with using CI S 
Subject perception of the impact of the CI S on asthma  
Subject perception of future use of a similar sy stem
Impact of CIS on ph ysician interaction
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exit Interviews
Exit interviews will be conducted for subjects at selected sites at thevisit after they  have
completed their course of study  medicatio n(V11) . Exit interviews are qualitative 
interviews conducted with study  subjects to capture a subject ’sexperience on changes in 
asthma and perceptions of the CI S.
Interview questions are des igned to fully  assess a subject’s experience in a structured 
format b y a trained interviewer. Subject feedback will audio -taped for subsequent 
transcription and qualitative anal ysis. 
These exit interview swill be conducted b y external vendors after subjec ts have 
completed V11 . For logistical reasons, this phone call need not occur at the cl inical site 
and can be com pleted within 14 day s of V11 .The anal ysis and report of the exit 
interview will be managed by  a separate RAP.

499.2. Serious Adverse E vents (SA E),Non-Serious A dverse Events 
that leads to withdrawal and Non Serious A dverse Drug 
Reactions (A DR)
The Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of a , non -serious adverse events tha t leads to withdrawal, 
non-serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) or SAE. The definition of an ADR is any  
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product, for which there is a reasonable possibility  
that the untoward occurrence is causally related tothe medicinal product. ADRs are a 
subset of AEs for a given medicinal product.
Potential SAEs and associated non serious ADRs may  be identified from a subject’s 
primary  HCP repo rt or a subject ’s health records .The HCP will have the ultimate 
responsibility  for determining causality  and seriousness.
In some countries extra safet y information may be requested as required b y local 
Regulatory  Agencies and information providing detail of these extra safet y events and 
how these should be reported are included inAppendi x 7.
In this stud y, only information regarding non -serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) , 
AEs leading to withdrawal and serious adverse events (SAE s) will be detected, 
documented and reported. However, the definition of an AE is critical for the definition 
of non -serious ADRs and SAEs.
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix [ADDRESS_817589] to discontinue the study (see 
Section 8.1).
9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency  for Collecting A E, ADRand SA E 
Information
Any SAEs assessed as related to study  participation (e.g., protocol -mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a [COMPANY_004] 
product will be rec orded from the time a subject consents to participate in the 
study  up to and including any  follow -up contact. 
AEs leading to withdrawals and ADRs will be collected from the start of Study  
Treatment until the follow -up contact [CONTACT_616683] i n SoA Section 2
Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study  treatment but after 
obtaining informed consent may  be recorded on the Medical History /Current 
Medical Conditions section of the eCRF.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 
hours , as indicated in Appendix 3The investigator will submit any  updated SAE 
data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
50Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study 
subjects. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y 
time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event to be reasonabl y related to the study  treatment or study  participation, the 
investigator must promptly  notify  the sponsor.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs 
and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in 
Appendix 3.
9.2.2. Method of Detecting AEs, ADRs and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE
occurrence .
The Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of a non -serious adverse drug reaction (ADR), AE 
(leading to withdrawal) or SAE.
Potential SAEs , AE (leading to withdrawal) and asso ciated non serious ADRs may  be 
identified from patient’smedical r ecord s.  The Investigator will have the ultimate 
responsibility  for determining causality  and seriousness.
In this stud y, only information regarding non -serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs ), AE 
leading to withdrawal and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be detected, documented 
and reported. 
9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es, ADRs and SA Es
After the initial AE that led to withdrawal /non-serious ADR/ SAE report, the investigator 
is required to proactivel y follow each subject at subse quent visits/contacts. All SAEs , will 
be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the subject is 
lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures 
is given in Appendix 3.
9.2.4. Regulatory  Reporting Requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subject s 
and the safety  of a study  treatment under clinical investigation are met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  
authority  and other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatm ent 
under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply  with country -specific 
regulatory  requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, 
Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and 
investigators.
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
51Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory  requirements and 
sponsor policy  and forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safe ty report describing a SAE or 
other specific safet y information e.g., summary  or listing of SAE) from the 
sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and 
will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirement s.
In some countries extra safet y information may be requested as required b y local 
Regulatory  Agencies and information for this and how these should be reported are 
included in Appendi x 7.
9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events
For an y cardiovascular events as detailed in Appendix 3and all deaths, whether or not 
they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF 
will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regard ing 
cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. 
The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV Medical 
Dictionary  of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA )terms. The CV information should be 
recorde d in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a 
CV Event data query  prompting its completion. 
The Death CRF is provided immediately  after the occurrence or outcome of death is 
reported. Initial and follow -up reports re garding death must be completed within one 
week of when the death is reported.
9.2.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not 
Qualify ing as SA Es
The following disease related events (DREs) are common in subject s with asthma and 
can be serious/l ife threatening:
[IP_ADDRESS]. Asthma Exacerbations
For the purposes of this study , severe asthma exacerbations will be collected and 
recorded on the asthma exacerbation eCRF page from the start of treatment until follow 
up/or the EWvisit for those subjects that withdr aw from participation in the study .
A severe asthma exacerbation is defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the 
use/additional use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) ,or 
antibiotics an dinpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or emerge ncy department visit due to asthma that 
required s ystemic corticosteroids or antibiotics . Further clarification will be present in the

learning of the pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4.
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous ab ortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE.
9.2.8. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions)
Procedures for Documenting Medical Device Incidents are provided in Appendix 6.
9.3. Treatment of Overdose
For this study , any  dose of Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA greater than the prescribed dose within 
a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose.
[COMPANY_004] is not recommending specific treatment guidelines for overdose and toxicity  
management. The invest igator is advised to refer to the relevant document(s) for detailed 
information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other 
significant data pertaining to the stud y drug being used in this study . Such documents

11. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS
11.1. Hypothesis
The main purpose of the study  is to compare the effect of 6 months use with the CI S on 
adhere nce to ELLIPTA maintenance therapy  with adherence to ELLIPTA maintenance 
therap y without CI S use (sensor alone), in subjects with poorly  controlled asthma.  This 
study  aims to demonstrate the superiorit yof the CIS on adherence to Relvar/ Breo
ELLIPTA with an app compared to Relvar /BreoELLIPTA (with sensor alone ).  The 
primary  endpoint is mean percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken (daily  adherence) between 
Months [ADDRESS_817596] 
three months of the s tudy period (between months 4 to 6).  
The test for the primary  treatment comparison will be a test between Arm 1 versus Arm 
5.  This will be based on a two -sided h ypothesis testing approach: the null hypothesis is 
the difference between Arm [ADDRESS_817597] 
of the primary  endpoint are written below :
H0: Ti –Tj = 0
(where i = Arm 1 and j = Arm 5) The null h ypothesis: tha t the difference in response 
between Arm 1 and Arm 5 is zero.
Ha: Ti –Tj 0
The alternative hy pothesis: that the difference is not zero.
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817598] f or the primary  endpoint are the individual comparisons of
Arms 2, 3 and 4 with Arm 5 i n order to obtain estimated mean treatment difference sand 
95% confidence interval s. This will be a descriptive comparison to inform on the relative 
benefits of the individual aspects of the CIS and no formal inference is planned.
The effect on adherence t o maintenance therap y between arms with HCP and no HCP 
interaction, and arms with rescue medication use feedback versus none, will be also 
assessed.
The comparisons of interest for the other secondary  and safet y endpoints are as stated 
above for the primar y endpoint. Arms 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be individually  compared to Arm 
5, as relevant to the endpoint, in order to obtain estimated mean treatment differences and 
95% confidence interval s. This will be a descriptive comparison and no formal inference 
is plan ned.
11.2. Sample Size Determination
11.2.1. Sample Size A ssumptions
The fixed sample size calculation is based on the primary  endpoint, percentage of 
ELLIPTA doses taken (daily  adherence) between Months 4 and 6 as determined by  [CONTACT_616684] 90% power to detect a n absolute difference of 
15% in the primary  comparison.  The treatment difference is based on the limited 
published data [ Charles ,2007, van Boven ,2016].  This assu mes a conservative standard 
deviation of 28% (based o n a previous stud y [Charles ,2007 ]) and significance declared at 
the two -sided 5% level. 
Approximately  [ADDRESS_817599] 380 subjects 
(i.e. 76 subjects per arm) with available data over the last three months of the treatment 
period, in anticipation of a 12% drop -out within the first three months.  Subjects will be 
randomised to one of five treatment arms with a ratio of 1:1 :1:1:1.
Using the above assumptions the smallest observed effect predicted to result in a 
statistically  significant difference between treatment groups is 9% (minimum detectable 
difference) .
11.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity
Due to limited historical data within GS K, an external part y was hired to conduct a 
literature review. Based on results from the literature review onl y one paper in an 
asthmatic adult population provided adherence rates and variability  estimates that could 
be used as assumptions for power calcul ations [Charles ,2007 ]. 
The study  presented sample size assumptions for the treatment difference in mean dail y 
% adherence of 10% and a standard deviation of the data of 18% [s1]. The reported raw 
means (standard de viation) of mean daily  % adherence were 88% (16%) and 66% (27%) 
in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Due to uncertainty  in data variability  
a wide range of values were explored. Table 2below presents the power ac hieved with

Total PopulationThe Total Populat ion will comprise all subjects screened and for 
whom a record exists on the study database and will be used for the 
tabulation and listing of reasons for withdrawal before 
randomisation.
Intent -to-treatThe Intent –to–Treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who 
have been randomised and exposed to at least one dose of 
treatment. The ITT population will be used for all endpoint analyses 
and Outcomes will be reported according to the randomi sed 
treatment allocation. 
11.4. Statistical A nalyses
Where poss ible, data from subject s who withdraw prematurely  from the study  treatment 
or the study  will be included in any  relevant anal yses. Specific details for inclusion will 
be detailed in the Reporting and Anal ysis Plan ( RAP ).
The covariates to be considered in the efficacy  analy ses include age, sex, region and the 
baseline value s, if relevant. Other covariates, if appropriate, may  be considered. Specific 
details will be provided in the RAP.

[PHONE_12758].4.1. Adherence A nalyses
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Primary The pr imary analysis will estimate the treatment effect of [ADDRESS_817601] and HCP (Arm 1 vs Arm 5)for the primary endpoint percentage of ELLIPTA 
doses taken (daily adherence) between the beginning of Month 4 and the end of 
Month 6 as determined by [CONTACT_616685] .  The analysis will be performed 
on the ITT population.
The analysis will be per formed on the percentage adherence between Months 4 
and6 measure dusing an Analysis of Covariance ( ANCOVA )model allowing for 
effects due to randomised treatment, baseline adherence, duration (days) in run -in, 
region, sex, and age (years).   Baseline adher ence will be the percentage ELLIPTA 
doses taken (daily adherence) during the last [ADDRESS_817602] not taken t heir treatment within 
the 24 hour time period/window , where there is no evidence of a medical device 
incident having occurred.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study will have their post -withdrawal 
daily adherence data imputed using data from the control arm using a n appropriate 
method of imputation, such as the jump to refe rence method .  This method of 
assessing the primary endpoint corresponds to a de -facto treatment policy 
estimand which reflects the anticipated behaviour that subjects will con tinue to take 
an asthma combination therapy without the CIS intervention.  
Missing data due to a medical device incident such as device failure, technical 
failure of the e -sensor, ordata transmission failure will be assumed to be missing 
at random (MAR). For each subject the percentage adherence measure will be 
calculated under the assumption that any missing data is MAR, from the proportion 
of the number of days a subject is adherent divided by [CONTACT_616686] 3 months treatment period .
The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment difference for 
the primary treatment comparison of Arm 1 versus Arm 5 will be presented 
together with a 95% confidence interval for the difference and corresponding p -
value.
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) of the 
primary endpoint will be provided.
Where possible, adherence data collected from subjects who withdraw prematurely 
from study treatment will be included in the analysis.
Sensitivi tyanalys es of the primar y adherence endpoint will be performed on the 
ITT population and an assessment of the i mpact of the missing data will be carried 
out using multiple imputation methods under different assumptions for missing data
for withdrawn subje cts.  Details will be provided in the RAP.

2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
[PHONE_12763].3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
AE Definition
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject , temporally  
associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the 
study  treatment.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing 
disease).
Exac erbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be rep orted as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
"Lack of efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
report ed as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy  
assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy  will be reported as AE or SAE if they  fulfil the definition of an AE 
or SAE. 
The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they  fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, "lack of 
efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action " constitutes an AE or SAE.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_99479] ’s condition.
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
72The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject ’s 
condition.
Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy , appendectom y): th e condition that leads 
to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
Definition of SA E
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/sy mptoms of the disease under study , 
death due to progression of disease).
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
subject was at ris k of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22770], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually  involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_294504]/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or outpatient 
setting. Complications that oc cur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a complication 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23919], the event is serious. When in 
doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be 
considered serious.
Hospit alization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal 
life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may  interfere with or prevent every day life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
73e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_616657]. These events should usually  be considered 
serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
Definition of Cardiovascular Events
Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition:
Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the 
following AEs and SAEs:
Myocardial infarction/unstable angina
Congestive heart failure
Arrh ythmias
Valvulopathy
Pulmonary  hypertension
Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack
Peripheral arterial thromboembolism
Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism
Revasc ularization
Recording A E and SA E
AE and SAE Recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related 
to the event.
The investig ator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238] ’s medical 
records to [COMPANY_004] in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_004] /AE/SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_216562]  
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817616] number, will be 
redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_333205] .
The investigator will attempt to estab lish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assess ment of intensity  for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_423] , causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An e vent that causes sufficiently  discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for ratin g the 
intensity  of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes 
as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Caus ality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A "reasonable possibility " of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationsh ip, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relations hip of the event to study  treatment administration 
will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the inves tigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report t o [COMPANY_004] . However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_004] .
The investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 
informa tion and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality  assessment.
2016N307903_01 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817617] of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  [CONTACT_31859]/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory  tests or investigation s, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
If a subject dies during participation in the study  or during a recognized follow -up period, 
the investigator will provide [COMPANY_004] with a cop y of any  post -mortem findings including 
histopathology
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information.
Reporting of SA E to [COMPANY_004]
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004] viaElectronic Data Collection Tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting SAE to [COMPANY_004] will be the electronic data collection 
tool.
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the 
paper SAE data collection tool (see nex t section).
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes 
available.

Pregnancy  Information
Definitions
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below)
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
1.Premenarchal
2.Premenopausal female with ONE of the following:
Documented h ysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of subject ’s
medical records, medical examination, or medical history  interview.
3.Postmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in 
the postmenopau sal range may  be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy  
(HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient. 
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish 
to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT 
to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status b efore stud y enrollment.
Contraception Guidance
Female subject s
Female subject s of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to use a 
highl y effective method of contraception consistently and correctly  as described in Table 
3.

Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation b
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)
bilateral tubal occlusion
Vasectomized partner 
(A vasectomized part ner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. )
Sexual abst inence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in re lation to the duration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject .)
NOTES: 
a. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subject s inclinical studies. 
b. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of 
the contraceptive method. In this case two highly effective methods of contraception sho uld be utilized during the 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_817620]
Additional pregnancy  testing should be performed duri ng the treatment period as 
decribed in the SOA  and a time (>5 day s) corresponding to time needed to eliminate 
study  treatment after the last dose of study  treatment and as required locall y

79Pregnancy  testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cy cle is missed or when 
pregnancy  is otherwise suspected 
Pregnancy  testing, with a sensitivity  of [5, 10, 25] mIU/mL will be performed using the 
test kit provided locally  or by [CONTACT_616693] n
Female Subject s who become pregnant
Investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any  female subject , who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study . 
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and subm itted to [COMPANY_004] within [ADDRESS_817621] 's pregnancy . 
Subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . The investigator 
will collect follow up information on subject and neonate, which will be forwarded to 
[COMPANY_004] Generally , follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks bey ond the 
estimated delivery  date.  
Any termination of pregnancy  will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. 
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such.  
Any SAE occurring as a resu lt of a post -study  pregnancy  which is considered reasonabl y 
related to the stud y treatment by [CONTACT_093], will be reported to [COMPANY_004] as described in 
Appendix 3. While the investigator is not obligated to actively  seek this informat ion in 
former stud y subject s, he or she may  learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating  
will discontinue study  treatment or be withdrawn from the study

Definition and Documentation of Medical Device Incidents
Definition s of a Medical Device Incident
The detection and documentation procedures described in this protocol apply  to all [COMPANY_004] 
medical devices provided for use in the stud y (see Section 7.3for the list of [COMPANY_004] medical 
devices). 
Medical Device Incident Definition
A medical device incident is any  malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or 
performance of a device as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for 
use which, directly  or indire ctly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a 
subject /user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health.
Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of 
such a result might have b een due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention 
of health care personnel.
It is sufficient that:
An incident associated with a device happened and
The incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious 
deterior ation in health.
A serious deterioration in state of health can include an y of the following:
Life-threatening illness
Permanent impairment of body  function or permanent damage to bod y structure
Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to p revent one of the 
above 
Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality  or birth defects
Examples of incidents
A subject , user, caregiver, or healthcare professional is injured as a result of a medical 
device failure or its misuse.
A subject ’sstudy  treatment is interrupted or compromised by  a medical device failure.
A misdiagnosis due to medical device failure leads to inappropriate treatment.
A subject ’shealth deteriorates due to medical device failure.

For incidents ful filling the definition of an AE or an SAE, the appropriate AE/SAE CRF 
page will be completed as described in Appendix 3
The form will be completed as thoroughl y as possible and signed b y the investigator 
before transmittal to the [COMPANY_004] .
It is very  important that the investigator provides his/her assessment of causality  
(relationship to the medical device provided b y [COMPANY_004]) at the time of the initial report and 
describes an y corrective or remedial actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident.
A remedial action is an y action other than routine maintenance or servicing of a medical 
device where such action is necessary  to prevent recurrence of an incident. This includes 
any amendment to the device design to prevent recurrence.

[PHONE_12767].7. Appendi x 7: Country -specific requirements
13.7.1. Additional Adverse Event (A E) Reporting : Country -specific 
requirements for Canadian investigators:
The purpose of this information is  to comply  with Health Canada guidelines. They  state 
that all events associated with la ck of efficacy  of marketed investigational products must 
be documented and reported.
Health Canada requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to expeditiously  report domestic 
cases of unusual failure in efficacy  (UFIE) for new drugs to the Marketed Health 
Produ cts Directorate (MHPD) within [ADDRESS_817623] notification. This regulation applies 
to marketed drugs, and used as directed per the Canadian prescribing information, 
including those drugs used in Phase IV (non CTA filed) clinical trials.  
Adverse event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have to have a causal re lationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfav ourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding) 
symptom or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  associated with the use of a 
Medicinal Product. For a marketed Medicinal Product, this can also include failure to 
produce expected b enefits (i.e. lack of efficacy , with or without an adverse event), 
In order for [COMPANY_004] to comply  this Canadian regulatory  requirement, Canadian investigators 
are required to collect, record and report lack of efficacy events as perTable 4.

Protocol Title: An open label, randomised, parallel group clinical study  to evaluate the 
effect of the Connected Inhaler Sy stem (CI S) on adherence to Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA 
therap y, in asthmatic subjects with poor control
Short Title: A clinical study  to evaluate the effect of the Connected Inhaler Sy stem (CI S) 
on adherence to maintenance therap y in poorl y controlled asthmatic patients
Rationale: This s tudy will be the first to evaluate the effect of the CIS on adherence to 
maintenance therap y (Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA ) in uncontro lled asthmatic patients (A sthma 
Control Test [A CT]<20at the screening visit and ACT <20 at a subsequent 
randomisation visit foll owing run in)
The study  has been designed to assess how the CIS impacts adherence, of asthmatic 
patients, to maintenance therap y, when both the subject and the healthcare professional 
(HCP )receive data from the sensor on the patient’s Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA maintenance 
therap y. 
In addition, the five treatment arms of the stud y will allow evaluation of different 
elements of the CIS including, having additional data provided from a sensor on rescue 
medication and also the effect of the patient alone seeing an ydata with no data shared to 
the HCP, or  both the patient and HCP, seeing the data from the sensors Furthermore, this 
study  will provide preliminary  data evaluating the effect of the CIS on patient outcomes, 
including rescue medication use , patient report ed outcomes and change in asthma control 
as as assessed b y the Asthma Control Test (ACT) .

Approximately  [ADDRESS_817639] data available for the primary  anal ysis;an es timated 
total of [ADDRESS_817640], once 50% of the planned number 
of subject s have completed Visit 10. An adjustment of the sample size, for arms 1 and 5, 
is conditional on the primary  endpoint anal ysis results observed.   However, no more than 
a further 42 subjects will be randomised in to each of arms 1 and 5 to provide a n 
anticipated maximum of approximately  114 (76+38) subjects in each of those 2 arms and 
so an estimated total number of 456 subjects in all arms.
Treatment Groups and Duration:
All randomised subjects will receive Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA, at the dose allocated at the 
run in.
All subjects will have sensors attached to both their Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA and 
salbutamol Metered Do se Inhaler ( MDI ). It is the ty pe of data provided by  [CONTACT_150894] S  
(either Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA alone or Relvar/Breo ELLIPTAand salbutamol MDI) , as 
well as who sees that data, (subject alone or subject and HCP ), that defines the treatment 
arms.

143. INTRODUCTION
[COMPANY_004] has, in col laboration with Propeller Health, developed a sensor which clips on to the 
ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) , herein referred to as ELLIPTA . The sensor will 
measure when the ELLIPTA mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_616631], via an application (app) on a smart phone to the patient . This will inform 
a patient if/when a dose of Relvar /Breo has been actuated from the ELLIPTA . Other 
information, including: asthma management strategies, tracking of s ymptoms, asthma 
triggers, medi cation reminders and daily asthma forecasts involving weather and air 
quality  data ,will also be provided via the app. Information from a second sensor on a  
patient’s rescue medication metered dose inhaler (MDI) c ould also provide feedback, via 
the app, t o the patient on their salbutamol (albuterol) MDI use. The data from both 
Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA and salbutamol MDI can also be shared, via an online dashboard, 
with the patient’s Health Care Professional ( HCP ), see Figure 1and Prop eller Sy stem 
Site Manual (PSSM) . The sensors, app, dashboard and systems to provide data are
subsequently  described as the Connected Inhaler Sy stem (CI S).
Figure [ADDRESS_817650] of the CI S on adherence to maintenance 
therap y (Relvar/Breo E LLIPTA ) in uncontrolled asthmatic patient s (Asthma Control Test

run-in).The run -in exists to ensure a stable level of control prior to entry  into the study , 
given the possible change in treatment andis described in detail in Section 5.1.
The study  has been designed to assess how the CIS impacts adherenc eof asthmatic 
patients to maintenance therap y,when both the subject and the HCP receive data on 
adherence from thesensor on the patient’s Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA maintenance therapy . 
In addition ,thefive treatment arms of the stud y will allow evaluation o f different 
elements of the CIS . These include; having additional data provided from a sensor on

[ADDRESS_817651] and patient reported outcomes (PROs) .
3.2. Background
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory  disease of the airway s that results in hy perreactivity  
and clinically  relevant epi[INVESTIGATOR_228768], chest tightness and c oughing. Although 
asthmatic sy mptoms can normally  be controlled, by  [CONTACT_3148], it remains a serious 
condition that is associated with a number of different impacts and co-morbidities such 
as; fatigue, activity  impairment , psy chological problems (anxiety , depression and stress), 
lung infections and delays in growth (paediatrics). 
The underl ying path ophysiology  of asthma includes epi[INVESTIGATOR_616632], smooth muscle 
contr action, bronchial hyperreactivity and airway inflammation [Koterba , 2012 ]. 
Depending on the asthmatic patient, these s ymptoms can become worse during the 
evening and/or with exercise [ Martinez , 2007 ]. Asthma is believed to affect the lives of 
approximately  [ADDRESS_817652] [ GINA,2017]. Also, a s asthma is an inflammatory  condition that is 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_616633], patients can exhibit symptomatic adherence to maintenance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
[Anarella , 2004 ]. 
Inadequate control of asthma sy mptoms continues to be a serious problem, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_616634], adherence rates remain less 
than optimum [Anarella ,2004 , Foster ,2014 ]. The significance of adherence to treatment 
regimens in the management of asthma is becoming ever more evident. Avariet y of 
studies have indicated that poor adherence to maintenance therap y is intimately 
associated with reduced qua lity of life and, increased ;asthma sy mptoms, oral steroid 
usage, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_616635]  [Patel , 2013; Williams , 2011, Normansell ,2017]. 
Furthermore, reduced adherence to maintenance therap y can lead to an overuse of rescue 
medication, which has been linked to poorer health status [ Patel ,2013]. 
Due to the chronic nat ure of the disease ,lowadherence rates are recognised as oneof the 
main contributing factors to reduced control among stasthmatic patients. Therefore, the 
requirement for routine and habitual use of maintenance therap y is paramount. 
Currently , determination of inherent adherence rates are questionable due to their largel y 
subjective (patient diaries), unreliable (prescription refills) and imprecise (dosage 
counters) data acquisition methodologies . Each of these methods can misrepresent what 
is occurring in the real world. Furthermore, clinicians’ estimations of adherence rates can
be inaccurate, patient self -reported adherence rates are notoriousl y overestimated and 
some electronic dose counters can also beproblematic due to dose dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [ Bae,2009 ; 
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
16Zeller , 2008 ]. Because of these uncertainties, there is an abundance of research being 
undertaken in the area of inhaler sensors for adherence. Novel solutions to some of the 
aforementioned problems are currentl y in development, such as; actuation switches ( e.g.
Smart inhaler and Propeller Health MDI sensor ) for time stampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], heated thermistors 
(MDI log) for inhalation detection, microphones (INCA Device) for detecting peak 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_616636], accelerometers (Amiko and MDI Log) for time 
stampi[INVESTIGATOR_616660], and light transmitters (SmartTrack and SmartTouch) 
for detection of canister depression and time stampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Dosing regimens (once daily  vs. twice daily ) have also unsurprisingl y been found to have 
an effect on adherence to maintenance t herap y.  Fewer doses required on a daily  basis as 
part of maintenance therapy , has been shown to increase adherence rates aswell as 
creating amore routine and habitual dosing times [ Coleman , 2012 ]. 
It has be en shown that the addition of a sensor which has the ability  to feedback 
information is associated with increased adherence rates in paediatric patients of between 
30 and 50% [ Chan , 2016 ; Foster , 2014 ]. Unfortunately , the population (paediatrics) and 
the inherent variability  of the data make interpretation and extrapolation to other 
populations problematic. However, a20-30% increase in adherence rates when using 
inhaled corticosteroids has been shown to lead to clinically  relevant effects ,such as, a 
reduction in exacerbations [ Williams ,2011 ].Whilst many  studies have used sensors to 
measure adherence, relatively  few studies have assessed the influence of sensors on 
adherence rates and even less information exists to demonstrate the link between 
adherence and clinicall y relevant outcomes or patient reported quality  of life.
Adherence rate measurements should be unobtrusive, o bjective and accurate, in order to 
correctly  identify  innate patient adherence rates [ Chan , 2015 ]. Accordingly, Propeller 
Health ,in collaboration with [COMPANY_004] ,has developed a sensor, which can clip onto any  
ELLIP TA DPI [INVESTIGATOR_616637] . The sensor can be detached and transferred to subsequent inhalers by  
[CONTACT_50246] . Propeller Health alread y produces a sensor that clips on to the top of a 
rescue MDI and records time and date of actuation. The data, from both of these sensors
can then be fed back to the patient or patient and their HealthCare Professional (HCP)
through the use of an a pp or dashboard . Patient/HCP interaction with the data through the 
app/dashboard may  enable greater engagement between the patie ntand their HCP 
regarding their asthma . The app associated with the Propellor Health sensor also provides 
information on asthma management strategies, tracking of s ymptoms, asthma triggers, 
medic ation reminders and daily  asthma forecasts involving weather and air quality  data, 
in order to improve a patients ’understanding of ,and relationship with ,their asthma.
It is believed that engaging apatient’s interest in their asthma could improve their 
adherenc e to their maintenance therap y and ultimately  improves their asthma outcomes 
as much of the research supports the importance of adherence rates to asthma control
[Sapir , 2017 ]. Therefore, if through the use of the CI S, a patie nt can engage with their 
asthma , this may improve adherence andultimately  improve their level of asthma control. 
Furthermore, from a nHCP perspective, having accurate adherence data would make 
discussions with their patients more objective and informed when considering appropriate 
asthma management strategies .

3.3.1. Risk assessment for Relvar/Breo 100/25mcg and 200/25mcg
For Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA , the following risks and the corresponding mitigation 
strateg ies,as applicable to asthma pati ents,were taken from the summary  of safet y 
concerns in the European Union –Risk Management Plan (EU -RMP). For Relvar/Breo 
the rationale for the risk assessment was derived from the 2014 -2016 Investigator 
Brochures, from an integrated analy sis of key  Relv ar/Breo studies.
Potential Risk of 
Clinical SignificanceSummary of Data/Rationale for 
RiskMitigation Strategy
Investigational Product (IP) (fluticasone furoate [ FF]/vilant erol [VI]])
Pneumonia in patients 
withasthmaThe incidence (adjusted for 
exposu re) seen with FF/VI 100/25 
microgram strength (9.6/1000 
patient years) was similar to 
placebo (8.0/1000 patient years). 
The incidence was slightly higher 
for FF/VI 200/25 microgram 
(18.4/1000 patient years). No risk 
factors were identified.The risk of pne umonia in asthma 
patients is consistent with the risk 
of other ICS. Subjects are not at 
an increased risk in this study, 
since they enter the study on an 
existing ICS treatment. Subject s 
are alerted to the potential risk of 
pneumonia in the informed 
consen t. 
Subject s with a concurrent 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_616638].
Asthma related 
intubations and deathsThis is a class effect of Long -Acting 
Beta2 -Agonist (LABA )in asthma. 
This has not been observed for 
FF/VI .
A Food And Drug Administratio n 
(FDA)meta -analysis of LABA vs. 
no LABA (60,954 patients in 110 
trials) by [CONTACT_424356] a composite 
endpoint of asthma -related deaths, 
intubations, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] 
(asthma composite index) showed 
a statistically significant difference 
among age grou ps.  The composite 
event incidence difference for all 
ages was 6.3 events per 1000 
patient -years (95% CI: 2.2 -10.3) 
with LABAs compared with no 
LABA use. Among the 15,192 
patients with concurrent ICS use, 
the incidence difference was 0.4 
events per 1000 pa tient-years (95% Subject s with a history of life -
threatening asthma are excluded 
from the study.

18CI: -3.8 to 4.6).  The authors noted 
a trend of greater excess risk with 
LABA among the younger age 
groups [ McMahon , 2011 ].
Three large studies (two in adults, 
one in children) with ICS/LABA 
compounds  have shown no 
increased risk of serious asthma 
related events compared with ICS 
alone ( Stempel , 2016a ; Stempel et 
al, 2016 b, Peters et al, 2016 ).
Serious cardiovascular 
eventsIn an analysis performed on the [ADDRESS_817653] been 
reported in patients exposed to 
FF/VI. Seven event s in FF/VI 
100/25 and one event in FF/VI 
200/25. This represents an 
incidence less than 1% in the 
asthmatic patients exposed to 
FF/VI. a
The events reported include atrial 
fibrillation, acute coronary 
syndrome, coronary artery disease, 
hypertension, myocar dial ischemia, 
tachyarrhythmia and tachycardia.
Therefore fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol should be used 
with caution in patients with severe 
cardiovascular disease or heart 
rhythm abnormalities, 
thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected 
hypokalaemia or patients 
predispo sed to low levels of serum 
potassium.Subject s with existing serious 
cardiovascular disease , 
thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected 
hypokalaemia or patients 
predisposed to low levels of 
serum potassium are excluded 
from the study.
Investigators are made aware of 
the potential class effects of 
LABAs and are advised to 
exercise caution for subjects with 
existing serious cardiovascular 
disease (Section 6.3 [Warnings 
and Precautions] of the IB) .
Hypersensitivity No FF/VI drug related 
hypersensitivity was noted in 
clinica l trials.
Spontaneous reports of 
hypersensitivity reactions have 
been reported in post -marketing 
data for FF/VI. A possible causal 
association cannot be ruled out Subject s will be informed about 
the risk of hypersensitivity in the 
informed consent. They will be 
advised to seek medical 
treatment if any signs of 
hypersensitivity occur.

Decreased bone mineral 
density and associated 
fracturesRisk of fracture has been 
associated with oral corticosteroids. 
It is unclear if inhaled 
corticosteroids carry the same risk. 
Currently the risk of reduced bone 
mineral density has not been 
observed in the asthma population 
[Jones , 2002 ]. In addition specific 
assessments in adolescents with 
asthma have not demonstrated an 
effect on bone mineral density, 
when controlled for growth [ König , 
1993 ;Turpeinen ,2010] .
In an analysis performed on the 11 
key studies in subjects with asthma 
bone fractures were reported by 
<1% (7034 patients) of subjects 
who received FF/VI 100/[ADDRESS_817655] s will already be 
prescribed ICS/LABA treatments 
for their asthma. Therefore, it is 
unlikely that such an effect will 
occur.
Adrenal Suppression This is considered a class effect of 
ICS. Preclinica l studies showed 
that FF effects are comparable with 
other corticosteroids. No studies 
have shown a clinically relevant 
effect of FF/VI on the hypothalamic -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_335979] (HPA) at the 
100/25 strength. This includes a 
formal HPA study (HZA106851), 
using 24 -hour serum cortisol 
measurements, and multiple 
studies with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and 
asthma subjects which monitored 
urinary cortisol.Subject s will be informed about 
the risk of adrenal suppression in 
the informed consent. 
Investigators are made aware of 
the potential for this class effect 
in Section 6.3 (Warnings and 
Precautions) of the Investigators 
Brochure ( IB). If systematic 
symptom sappear, investigators 
should implement an appropriate 
treatment while observing the 
subject’s’ asthma symptom s.
All subject s will already be 
prescribed ICS/LABA treatments 
for their asthma. Therefore, it is 
unlikely that such an effect will be 
experienced.
Corticosteroid

All subject s will already be 
prescribed ICS/LABA treatments 
for their asthma. Therefore, it is 
unlikely that such an effect will be

As a result of switching from other prescribed ICS/L ABA combination products and 
being randomised to a treatment arm in the study , subjects may  switch from an inhaled 
therap y that is taken twice daily , to a once daily therapy  (Relvar/Breo) t he patients in this 
study  may  have better adherence and sopossibl y better asthma control .There is also a 
potential benefit from use of the CIS. This has the potential to increase their adherence
through interaction with the data o uputs and engagement with their asthma . Data with 
marketed products suggests that adherence improves with less frequent 
administration /simplification of therap y and therefore it is expected that a once -daily 
treatment could improve adherence , which may  lead to improvements in disease control 
and reductions in healthcare resource utilisation costs [Foster , 2014 , Price ,2010, Toy,
2011 ].

213.3.2. Overall Benefit:R isk Conclusion
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) has assessed this study  for any  potential risks that a subject may  
experience. The investigational product (IP) FF/VI will be used as is detailed in the 
prescribing information and has an acceptable safety  profile for c linical use and there are 
no significant associated risks. This conclusion is supported by  [CONTACT_424357] y 
performed clinical studies with the products in healthy  volunteers and subjects with 
Asthma and COPD and post -marketing experience (see loc al label).
There is a small risk of destabilising asthma when switch ingto Relvar/ Breo. Patients will 
be provided with rescue medication and will be educated to recognise s ymptoms of 
asthma worsening and instructed to contact [CONTACT_616670].

2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
26This is an open -label, randomised, multi -centre , parallel group study  consisting of 5 
treatment arms , in asthmatic patients currently  on a fixed dose I CS/LABA maintenance 
therap y.
The procedures to be performed at each visit are shown in Section 2.The study  and visits 
are described here.
At all visits will require subjects to withhold a daily  dose of mainten ance therapy  and 
rescue medication for 6 hours ;as some asses sments will require ths restriction for 
validity  of the assessment (PEF and FeNO) and also so correct use can be demonstrated 
with that day s Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA dose at any required visit .
The treatment period for the study  is [ADDRESS_817665] could be on the study  for approximately  7, 8 or 9 months in total
Screening Visit (V 1)
Subjects who have provided their informed consent will be screened at Visit 1 (V1 ) for 
inclusion on the study . Subject s who meet all th e inclusion c riteria, including an ACT of 
<20, will en ter the flexible run-inperiod. Screening and starting the flexible run-incan 
occur at the same visit, however for logistical reasons the flexible run-incan start at a 
separate visit, which must be within [ADDRESS_817666] ’s 
inclusion on the study . Should a subject not meet the the inclusion/exclusion criteria, they  
will be registered as a screen failure.
Flexible Run -in
Following inclusion at screening all subjects will rec eive Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA DPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_616639] y and salbutamol MDI  rescue medication and be instructed to take 
these as prescribed. 
Instruction on correct use of the Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA DPI  [INVESTIGATOR_616640], particularly  in the case of subject s previously  using other devices, and/or using 
medication requiring twice -daily dosing.
Both the Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA and salbutamol MDI medication used by  [CONTACT_386124] s 
included on the study  will have a sensor fitted and switched on at the clinic vi sit. 
However, during this run-inperiod, there will be no information provided to the subject s 
or HCPs on their adherence to Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA oron their use of salbutamol MDI . 
Subjects will also be instructed in fitting the sensors onto both the ELLIPT A and MDI.
The run -in period canlast for1,[ADDRESS_817667] at end of 
each month of the run-inperiod .
Conditional Visit s2, 3 and 4 (V2, V3 and V4 )
At the end of each month of theflexible run -in period, ACT will be re-assessed at the 
clinical centre . If at the first month lyvisit of the flexible run-inthe subject ’s ACT is<20
(uncontrolled) then the subject will be randomised to study  treatment and subsequent run-

Randomization/treatment: Conditional Visits 2, 3 and 4 (V2, V3 and V4 )
Subjects who meet the randomisation inclusion criteria will be randomised to one of five 
CIS treatment arm sat this visit (V2, V3 or V4). All treatment arms continue with
Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA (ICS/L ABA) maintenance therapy  and Salbutamol MDI  rescue 
therap yasinthe run-inperiod and both inhalers continue having a sensor fitted. The 
treatment arms are defined by [CONTACT_616673] , from Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA 
(maintenance) orRelvar/Breo ELLIPTA (maintenance)  and salbutamol MDI ( rescue ), is 
fed ba ck to the subject or subject andHCP ,or not at all . The 5 treatments arms are as

1.Data on Maintenance use supplied to Subject (app) and HCP (dashboard)
2.Data on Maintenance use supplied to Subject (app)
3.Data on Maintenance and Rescue use supplied to Subject (a pp) and HCP (dashboard)
4.Data on Maintenance and Rescue use supplied to Subject (app)
5.No data supplied to Subject or HCP
Following randomisation ,subjects in arms 1, 2, [ADDRESS_817670] and register the sensors 
via Bluetooth to their smart phone and to the app . Subjects in arm 5 who receive no data 
will be provided with a home hub so that their data will be uploaded during study , though 
they and their HCP will not see that data. Technical and operational details around 
registering sensors, connecting sensors to smart phone or a home hub and other details of 
app connectivity  and function will be provided /referenced in the Study  Reference M anual
(SRM ).
Visit 5(V5)
Following randomisation ,subject s will be asked to return to the site ,after one month ,at

conditional visits, initiated by  [CONTACT_82275] ,will be recorded in the eCRF andin the subject’ s 
medical record , including if no action was taken .If the HCP reviews the data at a time 
other than for the conditional visit and schedules a visit for the subject, this will be 
recorded in the eCRF as an unscheduled visit . Furthermore, subjects in all arm s will be 
educated to recognise s ymptoms of asthma worsening and instructed to contact [CONTACT_616674]. These events will also be recorded in the eCRF as unscheduled visits.
Visit 10 (V10)
All Subjects will return to site for final study  assessments at the end of the 6 month 
treatment period.
Visit 11 (V 11Follow Up )
A follow -up visit will take place one week ( 2 days) after V10 and ma y be conducted as 
either a clinical visit or a phone call for final safety  check.   
A subject will be considered to ha ve completed the study  when they  have completed all 
phases of the stud y including screening, flexible run -in, the randomized treatment phase, 
and safet y follow -up.
Dispensing Visits
All Subject s will be asked to return to the pharmacy or an independent nur se/designee at 
the study  centre if a pharmacy  is not available for these dispensing visits. They  will need 
to bring theirused Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA and/or salbutamol MDI and clip -on sensors in 
order to pi[INVESTIGATOR_616641]/Breo ELLIPTA and/or salbutamo l MDI as required
during the course of the study . During these dispensing visits, the sensor will be attached 
to the new devices and switched on at the site . There will be no assessments performed, 
these visits are onl y for dispensing of stud y drug , as we ll as to ensur ethat subjects are 
able to transfer and pair the sensors. Subjects should return the previous Relvar/Breo 
ELLIPTA and an y salbutamol MDI that need replacing at these visits.
As a minimum ,the following will need to be captured : the date of v isit, medication
dispensed to the subject and also medication returned by  [CONTACT_423], including remaining 
doses on the ELLIPTA dose counter .This data should be recorded for entry into the 
eCRF.

29Early  Withdrawal Visit (EW)
Subjects who have permanently  discontinued study  treatment and have not withdrawn 
consent are encouraged to continue in the study  and complete all remaining protocol 
specified clinic visits  If a subject is withdrawn thenthey should complete the 
assessment sas per Section 2. Reasons for withdrawal are provided in Section 8.2.
5.2. Number of Subject s
Approximately  [ADDRESS_817676] ,once 50% of the planned number 
of subject s have completed V10. An adjustment of the sample size , for arms 1 and 5 ,is 
condition al on the primary  endpoint anal ysis results observed .However ,no more than a 
further 42subjects will be randomised in to each of arms 1 and 5 to provide a maximum 
ofapproximately 114(76+38) subjects with data available for the primary  analy sis in
each ofthose [ADDRESS_817677] completed the study  if he/she has completed the last 
scheduled procedure shown in Section 2,including the follow up visit.
The end of the stud y is defined as the date that the last subject completes the last 
scheduled procedure shown in the Section 2.
5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study  Design
This study  will be an open label study , as it is not possible to blind the treatment arms to 
which sensors (maintenance or rescue) are providing feedback to the patient via the app, 
and also, whether or not the patients’ HCP has access to this data via the dashboard.
A true con trol arm (no sensors on ELLIPTA or MDI) cannot be incorporated into the 
design.  A ll subject s need to have a sensor on their maintenance and rescue medication in 
order to consistentl y measure their adherence to maintenance and level of rescue 
medication us e; as other methods of measuring adherence and rescue medication use
(paper or electronic diaries and prescription refills) have inherent problems . Therefore, 
arm [ADDRESS_817678] possible match to normal current practise.
Any asthmatic patient who is currentl y uncontrolled (ACT<20) on their current
ICS/LABA medication may  be recruited and will ,as need ed,switch to Relvar/Breo 
ELLIPTA , if not alread y prescribed that . Due to this possible change in maintenance 
medication, a flexible run -in period has been incorporated into the study  design, to enable 
assessment of an y impact associated with the change of drug/dosing frequency ,or simply  
being on the study ,before being randomised to treatment on the study .
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817679] once 50% 
of the planned number of evaluable subject s have completed. Further information on this 
process isprovided in S ection 11.
5.5. Dose Justification
Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA and Salbutamol MDI  will be prescribed as per label. The dosage 
of Relvar/Breo prescribed to a subject at the beginning of the stud y will depen don the 
dosage of the ir current ICS/L ABA treatment and therefore, whether they  will receive 
either 100/25 mcg or 200/25 mcg Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA .Changing between doses is 
permitted during the study treatment period if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093].

information and/or consul tthe study  Medical Monitor if in doub t.
7.11. Treatment after the End of the Study
There is no plan to continue to provide treatment following the end of the study .  The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post -
study  care of the subject’s medical condit ion, whether or not [COMPANY_004] is providing specific 
post-study  treatment.
Medications initiated after completion of the assessments at V10 or the EWvisit will not 
be recorded in the eCRF unless taken to treat an AE or asthma exacerbation. subject s who 
have comp leted the EWvisit are allowed to use any  medications prescribed by  [CONTACT_616678].
8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA
Subjects that permanently stop study treatment are encouraged to remain in the study . 
Subject s have the right to discon tinue study  treatment before the end of the study . A 
subject may also be asked to discontinue study  treatment at the investigator’s discretion.
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817694] s who withdraw from study  treatment prematurely  (for any  reason) should, where 
possible, continue to be f ollowed -up as per protocol until the completion of the Safet y 
Follow -up assessments. If patients want to discontinue use of the CIS but will continue 
taking the Relvar/B reoELLIPTA DPI [INVESTIGATOR_616661] -on sensor for ELLIPTA . If this is not 
possible, the I nvestigator must encourage the subject to participate in as much of the 
study  as they  are willing (or able) to. Likewise ,subjects who change their dose of 
Relvar/Breo (FF/VI) at the discretion of the investigator during the study will be given 
the option to remain on the study .For those subjects who do not want to use the sensor
during the stud y, their health outcome information will be collected along with any  
additional adhe rence data. For those subjects who change dose, all information will 
continue to be collected for the duration of the study .
A subject may be withdrawn from stud y treatment at any time. A reason for premature 
discontinuation of study  treatment must be capt ured in the eCRF.
8.1. Discontinuation of Study  Treatment
8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_616648] .  If however the subject has a routine

sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such a 
withdrawal of consent.
Refer to the Section 2for data to be collected at the time of EWfrom the study
8.3. Lost to Follow Up
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly  fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y the study  site. 
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study  visit:
The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_616697]/or 
should continue in the study .
Before a subject is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must 
make every  effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155] (where possible, [ADDRESS_817696] ’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_225961] ’s medical record.
Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary  reason of lost to follow -up. 
9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summari sed in the Section 2. 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed 
Immediate safety  concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately  upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discontinue study  
treatment.
Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the Section 2, is 
essential and required for study  conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
subje cts meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all subject s screened and to confirm eligibility  or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable. 
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817697] ’s routine clinical management ( e.g., blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the inform ed consent form ( ICF)may be utilized 
for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified 
criteria and was performed within the time fr ame defined in the Section 2.
9.1. Efficacy  Assessments
9.1.1. Primary ,Secondary  and Other A dherence Measures
The Primary , Secondary  and Other adherence endpoint ( adherence to maintenance 
medication ) data is collected by  [CONTACT_616680] -on Senso r for ELLIPTA and records the time 
and date when the ELLIPTA cover is opened and closed.

in the SRM.
9.1.3. Question naires and Interviews
It is preferred that the questionnaires are administered at the same time of day  at each 
visit and that this time of day  is the same as when they  were originall y administered (as is 
feasible/appropriate), in order to avoid potential b ias due to the time of day when 
responding. The subjects should not be told the results of any diagnostic tests prior to 
completing the questionnaires and the questionnaires should be completed before an y 
procedures are performed on the subject to avoid in fluencing the subject’s response. 
Adequate time in a quiet, comfortable location must be allowed to complete all items on 
the questionnaires and if necessary , the subject must be encouraged to complete any
questio nnaires or missing items fully.Full guidan ce for obtaining good quality  data from 
patient -completed questionnaires is included in the SRM .
All the questionnaires will be completed on an ePRO device at the clinical study  site and

designed to be self -completed by  [CONTACT_423] . 
Please refer to the SRM for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Asthma Sy mptom Ut ility Index (A SUI)
The ASUI is a 10 -item self -administered questionnaire with 4 questions on asthma 
symptoms (Cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, awakening at night) and 1 question about 
the side effects of asthma medications [Revicki ,1998] .  For each s ymptom, there are 2 
dimensions; frequency  and severit y.  The questionnaire is based on a 2 -week patient 
recall of s ymptoms with response options of 0 to 4 for frequency  (not at all, 1 to 3 day s, 4 
to 7 day s, and 8 to 14 day s)and severity  (not applicable, mild, moderate and severe).

[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient A ctivation Measure (PA M)
Patient Activation Measure will be used to assess the knowledge, skills and confidence a 
person has in managing their own healt h and health care. The questionnaire will be 
completed at the times shown in the Section 2.
The PAM contains a series of 13 statements designed to assess the extent of a patient’s 
activation. These statements are about beliefs, confidence in the management of health -
related tasks and self -assessed knowledge. Patients are asked to rate the degree to which 
they agree or disagree with each statement. These answers are combined to provide a 
single score of between 0 and 100, which r epresents the patients ’concept of themselves 
as an active manager of their health and health care. There is no specified timeframe on 
which responses should be based, the questionnaire is suitable to be used to measure 
changes in activation over time and can be performed before and after an intervention
[Hibbard , 2004].
PAM will be completed by  [CONTACT_616682] 2.
Please refer to the SRM for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication A dherence Report Scale for A sthma (MA RS-A),10-item 
questionnaire
Reported adherence to medication will be assessed with the Medication Adherence 
Report Scale for Asthma (MARS -A) questionnaire at times shown in the Schedule of 
Activities (S oA).
The MARS -A is a 10 -item questionnaire where medication use is rated on a 5 -point 
Likert scale (1 indicating ‘alway s’ to 5 indicating ‘never’). It has been validated as a self -
reported measure of adherence with I CS for patients with asthma ,and includes generic 
(“I use it regularl y ever y day”) and lung condition -specific questions about medication 
use (“I onl y use it when I feel breathless”) [Cohen , 2009]. The MARS -A hasno 
specified timeframe on which responses should be based but generall y refer to the present 
moment .MARS -A will be completed on an ePRO device at the clinical study site and at 
the times detailed in the Section 2.
Please refer to the SRM for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Beliefs in Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ).
The BMQ questionnaire consists of the BMQ Specific, which measures perceptions of 
specific medicines, and the BMQ General, which measures more general beli efs about 
medicines. All items are rated on a 5 -point L ikert scale [Horne , 2002].
The BMQ General comprises a General Harm scale and a General Overuse scale 
assessing beliefs about pharmaceuticals as a class of treatm ent. The General Harm scale 
assesses beliefs about the intrinsic nature of medicines and the degree to which they  are 
perceived as harmful and should be avoided if possible. The General Overuse scale 
represents beliefs about the use of medicines and whethe r they  are overprescribed by  
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
45clinicians.  The BMQ Specific (Asthma) comprises two scales: one assessing patients' 
beliefs about the necessity  of preventer medication for maintaining present and future 
health (Necessity  scale), and the other assessing their concerns about the potential 
adverse consequences of using it (Concerns scale). Four items were added for use in 
patients with asthma .
BMQ will be completed on an ePRO device at the clinical study  site and at the times 
detailed in the Section 2.
Please refer to the SRM for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exit Questionnaire
All subjects will complete a questionnaire at the end of the final study  visit (V10) to

the CI S. It i s self -completed on the ePRO device by [CONTACT_1766] .It includes questions 
relating to the concepts below:   
Overall s atisfaction with CIS
Parts of the CISthat were most /least helpful
Level of engagement with the CI S
Challenges/difficul ties with using CI S 
Subject perception of the impact of the CI S on asthma  
Subject perception of future use of a similar sy stem
Impact of CIS on ph ysician interaction
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exit Interviews
Exit interviews will be conducted for subjects at selected sites at thevisit after they  have
completed their course of study  medicatio n(V11) . Exit interviews are qualitative 
interviews conducted with study  subjects to capture a subject sexperience on changes in 
asthma and perceptions of the CI S.
Interview questions are desi gned to fully  assess a subject’s experience in a structured 
format b y a trained interviewer. Subject feedback will audio -taped for subsequent 
transcription and qualitative anal ysis.

469.2. Serious Adverse E vents (SA E),Non-Serious A dverse Events 
that leads to withdrawal and Non Serious A dverse Drug 
Reactions (A DR)
The  Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of a , non -serious adverse events that leads to 
withdrawal, non -serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) or SAE. The definition of an ADR 
is any  untoward medical o ccurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the untoward occurrence is causally related tothe medicinal product. 
ADRs are a subset of AEs for a given medicinal product.
Potential SAEs and associated non serious ADRs may  be identified from a subject’s 
primary  HCP report or a subjects health records .The HCP will have the ultimate 
responsibility  for determining causality  and seriousness.
In some countries extra safet y information may be requested as required b y local 
Regulatory  Agencies and information providing detail of these extra safet y events and 
how these should be reported are included in Appendix 8.
In this s tudy, only  information regarding non -serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) , 
AEs leading to withdrawal and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be detected, 
documented and reported. However, the definition of an AE is critical for the definition 
of non -serio us ADRs and SAEs.
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found i n Appendix [ADDRESS_817702] to discontinue the study (see 
Section 8.1).
9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency  for Collecting A E, ADRand SA E 
Information
Any SAEs assessed as related to study  participation (e.g., protocol -mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a [COMPANY_004] 
product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the 
study  up to and including any  follow -up contact. 
AEs leading to withdrawals and ADRs will be collected from the start of Study  
Treatment until the follow -up contact [CONTACT_616699] 2
Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study  treatment but after 
obtaining informed consent may  be recorded on the Medical History /Current 
Medical Conditions section of the eCRF.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 
hours, as indicated in Appendix 4The investigator will submit any  updated SAE 
data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
47Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study 
subjects. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, includin g a death, at an y 
time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event to be reasonabl y related to the study  treatment or study  participation, the 
investigator must promptly  notify  the sponsor.
The method of recording, ev aluating, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs 
and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in 
Appendix 4.
9.2.2. Method of Detecting A es, ADRs and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detectin g AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE
occurrence .
The Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definitio n of a non -serious adverse drug reaction (ADR), AE 
(leading to withdrawal) or SAE.
Potential SAEs , AE (leading to withdrawal) and associated non serious ADRs may  be 
identified from patientsmedical r ecord s.  The Investigator will have the ultimate 
responsi bility  for determining causality  and seriousness.  .
In this stud y, only information regarding non -serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) , AE 
leading to withdrawal and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be detected, documented 
and reported. 
9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es, ADRs and SA Es
After the initial AE that led to withdrawal /non-serious ADR/ SAE report, the investigator 
is required to proactivel y follow each subject at subse quent visits/contacts. All SAEs , will 
be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, oth erwise explained, or the subject is 
lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures 
is given in Appendix 4.
9.2.4. Regulatory  Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of subject s 
and the safety  of a study  treatment under clinical investigation are met. 
The sponsor h as a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  
authority  and other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment 
under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply  with country -specific 
regulatory  requirements relating to safe ty reporting to the regulatory  authority , 
Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and 
investigators.
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
48Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local r egulatory  requirements and 
sponsor policy  and forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or 
other specific safet y information e.g., summary  or listing of SAE) from the 
sponsor will r eview and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and 
will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
In some countries extra safet y information may be requested as required b y local 
Regulatory  Agencies and information for this and how these should be reported are 
included in Appendix 8.
9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events
For an y cardiovascular events as detailed in Appendix 4and all deaths, whether or not 
they are considered SA Es, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF 
will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding 
cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. 
The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV Medical 
Dictionary  of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA )terms. The CV information should be 
recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a 
CV Event data query  prompting its c ompletion. 
The Death CRF is provided immediately  after the occurrence or outcome of death is 
reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one 
week of when the death is reported.
9.2.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not 
Qualify ing as SA Es
The following disease related events (DREs) are common in subject s with asthma and 
can be serious/life threatening:
[IP_ADDRESS]. Asthma Exacerbations
For the purposes of this study , severe asthma exacerbations will be collected and
recorded on the asthma exacerbation eCRF page from the start of treatment until follow 
up/or the EWvisit for those subjects that withdraw from participation in the study .
A severe asthma exacerbation is defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the 
use/additional use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) ,or 
antibiotics, an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or emergency  department visit due to asthma that 
required s ystemic corticosteroids or antibiotics . Further clarification will be present in the

If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator should inform GS Kwithin 2 weeks of 
learning of the p regnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5.
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE.
9.2.8. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions)
Procedures for Documenting Medical Device Incidents are provided in Appendix 7.
9.3. Treatment of Overdose
For this study , any  dose of Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA greater than the prescribed dose within 
a 24-hour time peri od will be considered an overdose.
[COMPANY_004] is not recommending specific treatment guidelines for overdose and toxicity  
management. The investigator is advised to refer to the relevant document(s) for detailed 
information regarding warnings, precautions, contra indications, adverse events, and other 
significant data pertaining to the stud y drug being used in this study . Such documents 
may include, but not be limited to, the IB or equivalent document provided by  [CONTACT_23983].
In the event of an overdose, the HCP/treating physician should:
1.Contact [CONTACT_27465] .
2.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in 
the CRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by  [CONTACT_616700] n with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject .

institutio n’s local laboratory require a change in subject management or are considered 
clinically  significant b y the investigator ( e.g., SAE or AE), then the results must be 
recorded in the eCRF.
9.5. Biomarkers
9.5.1. FeNO in breath
FeNO will be measured using a handheld ele ctronic device. Measurements will be 
obtained in accordance with the American Thoracic Society  (ATS )/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_355632]  (ERS) Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline 
Measurement of Exhaled L ower Respi[INVESTIGATOR_616662] O xide and Nasal Nitric Oxide 
[Silkoff , 2005] . All sites will use standardized equipment provided by  a central vendor. 
For each observation, at least 2 measurements will be obtained to establish 
reproducibility  (up to 8 measurements can be performed). FeNO measurements will be 
interpreted in accordance with the Official ATS Clinical Practice Guideline: 
Interpretation of Exhaled Nitric Oxide L evels (FeNO) for Clinical Applications [Dweik , 
2011] . FeNO observations must be completed before PEF assessments. Subject s should 
not use their rescue medication for at least [ADDRESS_817706] s should also withhold Breo/Relvar ELLIPTA for (1 
dosing interval ) appr oximat ely 24 hours  prior to FeNO assessment.
9.6. Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_105177] (PEF)
At visits where PEF is to be taken the subjects should withhold Salbutamol for 6 hrs 
before the visit and Relvar/Breo ELLIPTA for approximately  [ADDRESS_817707] ’s, or the prescribing phy sician . Prescriptions fo r a subjects asthma maintenance 
therap y(ICS or ICS/LABA combinations) for the [ADDRESS_817708] exploratory  health care resource utilization

11. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS
11.1. Hypothesis
The main purpose of the study  is to compare the effect of 6 months use with the CI S on 
adherence to ELLIPTA maintenance therapy  with adherence to ELLIPTA maintenance 
therap y without CI S use (sensor alone), in subjects with poorly  controlled asthma.  This 
study  aims to demonstrate the superiorit yof the CIS on adherence to Relvar/ Breo
ELLIPTA with an app compared to Relvar /BreoELLIPTA (with sensor alone ).  The 
primary  endpoint is mean percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken (daily  adherence) between 
Months [ADDRESS_817709] 
three months of the stud y period (between months 4 to 6).  
The test for the primary  treatment comparison will be a test between Arm 1 versus Ar m 
5.  This will be based on a two -sided h ypothesis testing approach: the null hypothesis is 
the difference between Arm [ADDRESS_817710] 
of the primary  endpoint are written below :
H0: Ti –Tj = 0
(where i = Arm 1 and j = Arm 5) The null h ypothesis: that the difference in response 
between Arm 1 and Arm 5 is zero.
Ha: Ti –Tj 0
The alternative hy pothesis: that the differen ce is not zero.
Other comparisons of interest f or the primary  endpoint are the individual comparisons of
Arms 2, 3 and 4 with Arm 5 in order to obtain estimated mean treatment difference sand 
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
[PHONE_12770]% confidence interval s. This will be a descriptive comparison to inform on the relative 
benefits of the individual aspects of the CIS and no formal inference is planned.
The effect on adherence to maintenance therap y between arms with HCP and no HCP 
interaction, and arms with rescue medication use feedback versus non e, will be also 
assessed.
The comparisons of interest for the other secondary  and safety  endpoints are as stated 
above for the primary  endpoint. Arms 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be individually  compared to Arm 
5, as relevant to the endpoint, in order to obtain  e stimated mean treatment differences 
and 95% confidence interval s. This will be a descriptive comparison and no formal 
inference is planned.
11.2. Sample Size Determination
11.2.1. Sample Size A ssumptions
The fixed sample size calculation is based on the primary  endpoint , percentage of 
ELLIPTA doses taken (daily  adherence) between Months 4 and 6 as determined by  [CONTACT_616701]  90% power to detect a n absolute difference 
of 15% in the primary  comparison.  The treatment difference is based on t he limited 
published data [ Charles ,2007, van Boven ,2016].  This assumes a conservative standard 
deviation of 28% (based o n a previous stud y [Charles ,2007 ]) and significance declared at 
the two -sided 5% level. 
Approximately  [ADDRESS_817711] 380 subjects 
(i.e. 76 subjects per arm) with available data over the last three months of the treatment 
period, in anti cipation of a 12% drop -out within the first three months.  Subjects will be 
randomised to one of five treatment arms with a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1.
Using the above assumptions the smallest observed effect predicted to result in a 
statistically  significant diff erence between treatment groups is 9% (minimum detectable 
difference) .
11.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity
Due to limited historical data within [COMPANY_004], an external part y was hired to conduct a 
literature review. Based on results from the literature review onl y one pape r in an 
asthmatic adult population provided adherence rates and variability  estimates that could 
be used as assumptions for power calculations [Charles ,2007 ]. 
The study  presented sample size assumptions for the tre atment difference in mean dail y 
% adherence of 10% and a standard deviation of the data of 18% [s1]. The reported raw 
means (standard deviation) of mean daily  % adherence were 88% (16%) and 66% (27%) 
in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Du e to uncertainty  in data variability  
a wide range of values were explored. Table 2below presents the power achieved with the 
proposed sample size of [ADDRESS_817712] Deviation (%) Power for Primary 
Comparison
[ADDRESS_817713] and variability  estimates seen at a 
planned interim anal ysis[Mehta , 2011 ] . The proposal is as follows:
Start with a fixed sample size calculation based on the primary  endpoint.
Independent statistician p erform sa planned unbli nded interim anal ysis to 
examine data based on 50% of subject son each arm having completed the 6 
months treatment period.
Based on the interim results (i.e.: treatment effect, data variabilit y and 
conditional power) ma intain or increase the sample size in order to obtain the 
desired power of 90%.
The conditional power based on the interim results will assess as to where it falls within 
certain regions established prior to the trial starting.  Should the conditional powe r be in 
the favourable or unfavourable range the sample size will not be adjusted and will remain 
at the fixed size for all treatment arms. Conditional power falling into the promising zone 
will h ave a sample size increase applied totreatment arm 1 and 5 only. However ,no 
more than a further 42 subjects will be randomised in to each of the treatment arms 1 and 
5 to provide a maximum of approximately 114 (76+38) subjects with data available for 
the primary  analy sis in each of those 2 arms such that a total number of 456 subjects in 
all arms are expected .
The regions and their implications on sample size are detailed below:
Favourable conditional power at interim (CPi[INVESTIGATOR_616664]) ≥ 90%
Promising CP min ≤ CPi[INVESTIGATOR_616664] < 90%
Unfavourable CPi[INVESTIGATOR_616664] < CP min
Full de tails of the adaptive method for sample size specified above will be given in the 
reporting and anal ysis plan (RAP).

[PHONE_12771].3. Populations for A nalyses
For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined:
Population Description
Enrolled All subject s who sign the ICF
Total PopulationThe Total Population will comprise all subjects screened and for 
whom a record exists on the study database and will be used for the 
tabulation and listing of reasons for withdrawal before 
randomisation.
Intent -to-treatThe Intent –to–Treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who 
have been randomised and exposed to at least one dose of 
treatment. The ITT population will be used for all endpoint analyses  
and Outcomes will be reported according to the randomi sed 
treatment allocation. 
11.4. Statistical A nalyses
Where possible, data from subject s who withdraw prematurely  from the study  treatment 
or the study  will be included in any  relevant anal yses. Specific details for inclusion will 
be detailed in the Reporting and Anal ysis  Plan ( RAP ).
The covariates to be considered in the efficacy  analy ses include age, sex, region and the 
baseline value s, if relevant. Other covariates, if appropriate, may  be considered. Specific 
details will be provided in the RAP.
11.4.1. Adherence A nalyses
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Primary The primary analysis will estimate the treatment effect of [ADDRESS_817714] and HCP (Arm 1 vs Arm 5) for the primary endpoint percentage of ELLIPTA 
doses taken (daily adherence) between the beginning of Month 4 and the end of 
Month 6 as determined by [CONTACT_616685] .  The analysis will be perf ormed 
on the ITT population.
The analysis will be performed on the percentage adherence between Months 4 
and6 measure using an Analysis of Covariance ( ANCOVA )model allowing for 
effects due to randomised treatment, baseline adherence, duration (days) in run-in, 
region, sex, and age (years).   Baseline adherence will be the percentage ELLIPTA 
doses taken (daily adherence) during the last [ADDRESS_817715] not taken their treatment within 
the 24 hour time period/window , where there is no evidence of a medical device 
incident having occurred.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from study will have their post -withdr awal 
daily adherence data imputed using data from the control arm using a n appropriate 
method of imputation, such as the jump to refe rence method .  This method of 
assessing the primary endpoint corresponds to a de -facto treatment policy 
estimand which refl ects the anticipated behaviour that subjects will continue to take 
an asthma combination therapy without the CIS intervention.  
Missing data due to a medical device incident such as device failure, technical 
failure of the e -sensor, ordata transmission f ailure will be assumed to be missing 
at random (MAR). For each subject the percentage adherence measure will be 
calculated under the assumption that any missing data is MAR, from the proportion 
of the number of days a subject is adherent divided by [CONTACT_616702] 3 months treatment period .
The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment difference for 
the primary treatment comparison of Arm 1 versus Arm 5 will be presented 
together with a 95% confidence inter val for the difference and corresponding p -
value.
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) of the 
primary endpoint will be provided.
Where possible, adherence data collected from subjects who withdraw prematurely 
from study t reatment will be included in the analysis.
Sensitivity analys es of the primar y adherence endpoint will be performed on the 
ITT population and an assessment of the i mpact of the missing data will be carried 
out using multiple imputation methods under diffe rent assumptions for missing data
for withdrawn subjects.   Details will be provided in the RAP.
Secondary The following secondary analyses will estimate the treatment effect of 6 months 
use of the  ELLIPTA maintenance therapy with CIS forthe following as pects of the 
CIS:
Maintenance data only supplied to subjects versus no data supplied to the 
subject (Arm 2 vs Arm 5)
Rescue and Maintenance data supplied to subject and HCP versus no data 
supplied to the subject and HCP (Arm 3 vs Arm 5)
Rescue and Maintena nce data only supplied to subject versus no data 
supplied to the subject (Arm 4 vs Arm 5)
for the following secondary endpoint s:
Percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken (daily adherence) between the 
beginning of Month 4 and the end of Month 6 as determined by t he 
maintenance sensor , 
Percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken (daily adherence) between the 
beginning of Month 1 and the end of Month 3
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
57Percentage of ELLIPTA doses taken (daily adherence) between the 
beginning of Month [ADDRESS_817716], baseline adherence, duration (days) in run -in, region, 
sex, and age (years).  Baseline adherence will be the percentage ELLIPTA doses 
taken (daily adherence) duri ng the last [ADDRESS_817717] not taken their treatment within 
the 24 hour time period/window, where there is no evidence of device or 
technical/transmission failure.  
Where possible, adherence data collected from subjects who withdraw prematurely 
from study treatment will be included in the analysis.   Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from study will be handl ed as per the primary endpoint analysis.   
The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment difference for 
the treatment comparisons of Arm 2 versus Arm 5, Arm 3 versus Arm 5 and Arm 4 
versus Arm 5 will be presented together with the 95% confidence interval for the 
differences and corresponding p -values.
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) of the 
secondary endpoint will be provided.
If a subject has changed dose during the study, sensitivity analyses on t he 
secondary endpoint(s) regarding ACT will be performed where these subjects are 
removed from the analysed population. Further details will be provided in the RAP.
Exploratory Will be described in the RAP.
11.4.2. Safety  Analyses
All safet y anal yses will be pe rformed on the ITT Population. 
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Safety SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal and non -serious ADRs will be collected.
Safety endpoints will include:
Incidence and type of serious adverse events
Incidence and type of adve rse drug reactions
Incidence and type of non-serious adverse events leading to study 
withdraw al
Incidence of subjects experiencing a severe exace rbation
The incidence of any given adverse event (SAE or ADR) for each treatment 
group is defined as the propo rtion of subjects in that group who have experienced 
at least one such adverse event during the study period.
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
58The number and percentage of subjects with SAEs, non-serious ADRs and AEs 
leading to study withdrawal will be summarised by [CONTACT_11702]. 
Thenumber and percentage of subjects experiencing  severe exacerbation sover 
treatment period and the follow -up period will be summarised for each treatment 
group alongside the primary causes of the exacerbation.
11.4.3. Other A nalyses
All other exploratory  endpo ints, except for qualitative data from exit interviews and 
questionnaires ,will be detailed in the RAP.
Analy sis of the qualitative data from exit interviews will be anal yzed following a separate
qualitative anal ysis plan and presented in a separate Clinic al Study  Report ( CSR ).
11.4.4. Interim A nalyses
An interim anal ysis will be conducted when 50% of subjects complete [ADDRESS_817718] a sample size re -estimation (refer to Section 11.2.3 for details) . 
At this interim an alysis the adherence data will be reviewed b y an independent statistics 
and programming group independent of the stud y team. In order to minimise the 
introduction of an y operational bias, good operating procedures will be built into an 
interim analy sis cha rter which will detail who will access the data, rules for altering the 
sample size and the procedure to be followed when recommending the sample size 
alteration.  The unblinded interim analy sis will be conducted by  [CONTACT_616703] g roup independent of the stud y team and reviewed b y an independent 
interim analy sis review committee who will notify  of the sample size outcome after 50%
of subjects have completed the [ADDRESS_817719] access to unblinded data 
within a restricted and firewalled area to ensure the study  team remain blind. 
Only  the primary  endpoint will be analy sed at this stage to determine the conditional 
power of having success at the end of the trial gi ven the interim results.
Further details of the internal statistics and programmer group role, data to be reviewed, 
committee membership, criteria, decisions and communication plan will be outlined 
clearl y in the charter.
Recruitment will continue while th e interim anal ysis is being conducted.

[PHONE_12774].4. Appendix 4: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
AE Definition
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject , temporally  
associated with the use of a study treatment , whether or not considered related to the 
study  treatment.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from bas eline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing 
disease).
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in fre quency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug inter action.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harmin g 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
"Lack of efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy  
assessments. However, the si gns, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy  will be reported as AE or SAE if they  fulfil the definition of an AE 
or SAE. 
The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be 
reported as AE or SA E if they  fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, "lack of 
efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action " constitutes an AE or SAE.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other ab normal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_99479] ’s condition.
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
70The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject ’s 
condition.
Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads 
to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occur rence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
Definition of SA E
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/sy mptoms of the disease under study , 
death due to progression of disease).
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, a t any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might h ave caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22770], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually  involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l or emergency  ward for observation and/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or outpatient 
setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a complication 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23919], the event is serious. When in 
doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be 
considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline i s not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal 
life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medic al 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may  interfere with or prevent every day life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
207040
71e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in deat h or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_616667]. These events should usually  be considered 
serious.
Examples of such events include inva sive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
Definition of Cardiovascular Events
Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition:
Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the 
following AEs and SAEs:
Myocardial infarction/unstable angina
Congestive heart failure
Arrh ythmias
Valvulopathy
Pulmona ry hypertension
Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack
Peripheral arterial thromboembolism
Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism
Revascularization
Recording A E and SA E
AE and SAE Recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the respon sibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related 
to the event.
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
It is notacceptable for the i nvestigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238] ’s medical 
records to [COMPANY_004] in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_004] /AE/SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_216562]  
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817729] number, will be 
redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_333205] .
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whene ver possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the follow ing categories: 
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_423] , causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently  discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for rating the 
intensity  of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes 
as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A "reasonable possibility " of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study  treatment administration 
will be considered and investigated.
The inve stigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] . However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_004] .
The investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality  assessment.
2016N307903_00 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_817730] of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or a s requested by  [CONTACT_31859]/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
If a subject dies during participation in the study  or during a recognized follow -up period, 
the investigator will provide [COMPANY_004] with a cop y of any  post -mortem findings including 
histopathology
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information.
Reporting of SA E to [COMPANY_004]
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_004] via Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting SAE to [COMPANY_004] will be the ele ctronic data collection 
tool.
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the 
paper SAE data collection tool (see next section).
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes 
available.
The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the 
eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the 
relationship of each SAE to I P/study  participation (causalit y) within [ADDRESS_817731] or receives updated data on a 
previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, 
then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the

Pregnancy  Information
Definitions
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WO CBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below)
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
1.Premenarchal
2.Premenopausal female with ONE of the following:
Document ed hysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of subject ’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history  interview.
3.Postmenopausal female
A po stmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in 
the postmenopausal range may  be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contracepti on or hormonal replacement therapy  
(HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient. 
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they  wish 
to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT 
to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.
Contraception Guidance
Female subject s
Female subject s of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to use a

Vasectomized partner 
(A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexua l partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. )
Sexual abstinence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refrainin g from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject .)
NOTES: 
a. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subject s inclinical studies. 
b. Hormonal contraception may be suscepti ble to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of 
the contraceptive method. In this case two highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_817733]

Female Subject s who become pregnant
Investigator will collect pr egnancy  information on any  female subject , who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study . 
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to [COMPANY_004] within [ADDRESS_817734] 's pregnancy . 
Subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . The investigator 
will collect follow up information on subject and neonate, which will be forwarded to 
[COMPANY_004] Generally , follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks bey ond the 
estimated delivery  date.  
Any termination of pregnancy  will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. 
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy  will be reported as an AE or SAE. 
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such.  
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study  pregnancy  which is considered reasonabl y 
related to the stud y treatment by t he investigator, will be reported to [COMPANY_004] as described in 
Appendix 4. While the investigator is not obligated to actively  seek this information in 
former stud y subject s, he or she may  learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and 
Reporting
Definition and Documentation of Medical Device Incidents
Definitions of a Medical Device Incident
The detection and documentation procedures described in this protocol apply  to all [COMPANY_004] 
medical devices provided for use in the stud y (see Section 7.3for the list of [COMPANY_004] medical 
devices). 
Medical Device Incident Definition
A medical device incident is any  malfuncti on or deterioration in the characteristics and/or 
performance of a device as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for 
use which, directly  or indirectly , might lead to or might have led to the death of a 
subject /user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health.
Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of 
such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention 
of health care personne l.
It is sufficient that:
An incident associated with a device happened and
The incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious 
deterioration in health.
A serious deterioration in state of health can include an y of the foll owing:
Life-threatening illness
Permanent impairment of body  function or permanent damage to bod y structure
Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
above 
Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality  or birth defects
Examples of incidents
A subject , user, caregiver, or healthcare professional is injured as a result of a medical 
device failure or its misuse.
A subject ’sstudy  treatment is interrupted or compromised by  a medical device failure.
A misdiagno sisdue to medical device failure leads to inappropriate treatment.
A subject ’shealth deteriorates due to medical device failure.

and on the appropriate form.
For incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE or an SAE, the appropriate AE/SAE CRF 
page will be comp leted as described in Appendix 4
The form will be completed as thoroughl y as possible and signed b y the investigator 
before transmittal to the [COMPANY_004] .
It is very  important that the investigator provides his/her assessment of causality  
(relationship to the medical device provided b y [COMPANY_004]) at the time of the initial report and 
describes an y corrective or remedial actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident.
A remedial action is an y action other than routine maintenance or servicing o f a medical 
device where such action is necessary  to prevent recurrence of an incident. This includes 
any amendment to the device design to prevent recurrence.

13.8.1. Additional Adverse Event (A E) Reporting : Country -specific 
requirements for Canadian investigators:
The purpose of this information is  to comply  with Health Canada guidelines. They  state 
that all events associated with lack of efficacy  of marketed investigational products must 
be documented and reported.
Health Canada requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to expeditiously  report domestic 
cases of unusual failure in efficacy  (UFIE) for new drugs to the Marketed Health 
Products Directorate (MHPD) within [ADDRESS_817736] notification. This regulation applies 
tomarketed drugs, and used as directed per the Canadian prescribing information, 
including those drugs used in Phase IV (non CTA filed) clinical trials.  
Adverse event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject adm inistered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have to have a causal re lationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding) 
symptom or disease (new or exac erbated) temporally  associated with the use of a 
Medicinal Product. For a marketed Medicinal Product, this can also include failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy , with or without an adverse event), 
In order for [COMPANY_004] to comply  this Canadian regulatory  requirement, Canadian investigators 
are required to collect, record and report lack of efficacy events as perTable 4.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia for 
Gulf War Illness  
 
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
 
Prepared: 12/09/2020  
 
Study Protocol  
 
I. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that telephone delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for 
insomnia (CBTi) will reduce insomnia and non-sleep Gulf War Illness (GWI) symptoms 
in Gulf War veterans with GWI. Specifically:  
1. Effect sizes will suggest that 8 -weeks of telephone CBTi  improves measures of 
insomnia severity, subjective sleep quality, and sleep diary measures of total 
sleep time, sleep onset latency (i.e., the time it takes to fall asleep), and sleep 
efficiency.  
2. Effect sizes will suggest that 8 -weeks of telephone CBTi  improves measures of 
non-sleep GWI symptoms, as assessed by [CONTACT_941] “symptom” portion of the Kansas 
Gulf War Military H istory and Health Questionnaire, and measures of fatigue, 
pain, cognitive dysfunction, and depression and anxiety.  
3. In subjects randomized to the treatment arm of the trial, post -CBTi improvements 
in measures of insomnia and GWI symptoms will be maintained at the 6 -month 
follow -up. 
II. Aims:  
1. Estimate effect size of telephone -delivered CBTi  on insomnia and sleep quality in 
veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI) and insomnia (i.e., have Insomnia Severity 
Index (ISI) scores  > 14). 
2. Estimate effect size of telepho ne-delivered CBTi  on GWI symptoms in veterans 
with GWI and ISI scores  > 14. 
3. Examine maintenance of telephone -delivered CBTi  effects at 6 -month follow -up. 
 
III. Study Design: The project will test the efficacy of telephone -delivered CBTi  for sleep 
and non -sleep symptoms associated with GWI by [CONTACT_746] a randomized, parallel -
group   trial with GW Veterans who meet both the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) case d efinition for Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI)4, the Kansas 
case definition for Gulf War Illness (GWI)5, and who have insomnia, operationalized as 
having ISI scores  > 14. 
  
The study's goal is to randomize 80 eligible participan ts to get 64 participants who 
complete the trial. Half of the participants will be randomly assigned to receive 
telephone CBTi  (TX). The other half will be randomized to a Monitor Only (MO) control 
group. Participants randomized to the TX group will receiv e [ADDRESS_682013]. Participants randomized to the MO group will be 
monitored for 8 weeks (i.e., they will be advised to continue doing whatever they were 
doing to manage their GWI and insomnia symptoms witho ut change dosage or 
frequency of treatment).  
  
Prior to randomization, all subjects will be monitored for 1 week with sleep diary. Sleep 
diary data will also be acquired continuously throughout the 8 study -weeks in both 
groups. Outcomes will be assessed in  all study participants at baseline (i.e., before 
randomization), mid - and post -treatment. In subjects randomized to TX, outcomes will 
be assessed once more, [ADDRESS_682014] Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) 
scores > 12, and/or who screen positive for obstructive sleep apn ea, and/or who do not 
meet the criteria for Kansas Gulf War Illness because of an exclusionary medical 
condition (e.g., seizures or heart disease).  
 
IV. Procedures:  
A. Subject Evaluations:  
1. Screening for Inclusion:  Once subjects have initiated contact, they will 
be given more information about the study by [CONTACT_525465]. An 
initial pre -screen will be performed over the telephone by a study staff 
member after subjects have given their verbal consent to determine 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
2. Clinical Screening:  If subjects pass the initial pre -screening for 
inclusion, they will participate in a clinical screening interview with an 
experienced clinical interviewer under the supervision of a licensed clinical 
psychologist. The clinical interview er will be kept blind to treatment 
assignment. The following instruments will be used in the clinical 
screening interview:  
a. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -V (SCID -515) will be used to 
assess DSM -V diagnostic criteria for Axis I disorders.  
b. Clinici an Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS56) will be administered to all 
study participants to assess posttraumatic stress disorder (P TSD) 
status at baseline.  
c. Addiction Severity Index -Lite (ASI -Lite) questionnaire will be used to 
obtaining data on the participant's history of  alcohol consumption  and 
substance use.  
d. Ohio State University Traumatic Brain Injury Identification Method 
(OSU TB I-ID69) This is a standardized procedure to elicit the lifetime 
history of TBI for an individual. The instrument is based on CDC; 
National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (2003) case 
definitions and recommendations for TBI surveillance  
e. Subjects will be screened with the Berlin Questionnaire to assess the 
likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) . 
f. Subjects will be screened with restless legs syndrome screening 
questionnaire (RLSSQ)75 to assess the likelihoo d of restless legs 
syndrome (RLS). An RLSSQ score  > 7,75 identifies patients with RLS 
with 97.9% sensitivity and 96.2% specificity, will be dropped from the 
study.  
If data from the clinical evaluation suggests that a subject is eligible for the study, the 
subject will be asked to keep a sleep diary for one week. Following that, the subject will 
be randomized to the C BT-I (TX) group or the Monitor Only (MO) group  
  
B. STUDY ASSESSMENTS:  The following assessments wil  be performed at 
baseline (i.e., before randomization), mid - and post -treatment in all participants. 
For participants randomized to TX, the assessments will be performed again 6 -
months after treatment.  
1) The  Insomnia Severity Index (ISI76) is a [ADDRESS_682015] month. The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, 
sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep 
dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, 
noticeability of sleep problems by [CONTACT_2312], and distress caused by [CONTACT_525466]. A 5 -point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no 
problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 
28.76 
  
2) The  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI77) is a self -report measure 
that provides a subje ctive assessment of sleep quality, sleep latency, 
sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sedative -
hypnotics, and daytime energy.  
  
3) The symptom portion of the  Kansas Gulf War Military History and 
Health Questionnaire ,7 which includes 32 questions about fatigue/sleep 
problems, somatic pain, skin abnormalities, gastrointestinal symptoms, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_525451], and neurologic/cognitive/mood symptoms, based 
on the Kansas and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
GWI case definition, will be used to assess Gulf War Illness (GWI) 
symptoms. To assess  current  GWI symptoms, we ask participants about 
the absence, presence, and severity of the symptoms over the past  [ADDRESS_682016] 6 -months.   A GWI Symptom 
Severity  score  will be derived by [CONTACT_525467] 30 of the GWI 
symptom questions. A higher score will ind icate more symptoms and 
symptoms of greater severity.  
  
4) The  Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)  is a 9 -item questionnaire reflecting 
the consequences of fatigue. It gives a single score (range 0 –7, high 
scores represent high levels of fatigue). A score of 4 ha s been described 
as the cutoff for clinical fatigue.78 
  
5) The  Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)79 is a 17 -item self -rating scale 
assessing demographic data, use of medications, as well as sensory, and 
reactive components of pain. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_525452], location (identified with a 
body map as a measure of pain distribution), chronicity, degree of relief 
due to therapy, and reactive pain (e.g., depression, suffering, and 
perceived availability of relief).  
  
6) The  Multiple Abilities Self -Report Questionnaire (MASQ)80 is a 38 -
item self -report measure of cognitive  function compared to same age 
peers across 5 domains (i.e., verbal memory, attention, language, visual 
memory, visuo -perceptual ability)  
  
7) The  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)81 will be used to 
assess  anxiety and depressive  symptoms.  
  
8) The  PCL-5,82 a 20-item self -report measure that assesses the 20 DSM -
5 symptoms of PTSD, will be used to monitor PTSD symptom change in 
subjects with PTSD.  
  
9) Sleep Diary:  All subjects will fill out an online (or paper) sleep diary for 
[ADDRESS_682017] to monitor adherence, treatment 
progress, and to inform interventions or sleep r estriction titration. Sleep 
diaries are daily self -monitoring forms that allow the self -recording of 
various sleep -related measures such as time in bed (TIB), total sleep time 
(TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep onset latency (SOL, the time 
it take s to fall asleep). Participant will also be asked to log the nature and 
dose of all medications in their sleep diaries. This information will be used 
to examine whether there are group differences in baseline rates of 
medication use, mean weekly rates of u se during treatment, or change in 
rates of use throughout the study.  
  
10) Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_525453].  
  
11) Morningness -Eveningness Scale  will be used to help case 
formulation  and to individualize administration of CBTi.  
  
All of the self -report assessments and sleep diary data will be obtained online via the 
Qualtrics survey tool. If participants do not have access to a personal computer and/or 
would prefer to fill out the sel f-report assessments and sleep diary via pencil -and-paper, 
they will be allowed to do so and will be provided a stamped envelope with which to mail 
the assessments and sleep diary back to us.  
  
We will  template and write brief notes about the CBT i treatment in the VA’s 
computerized patient record system ( CPRS ) as is expected with treatment studies.  
 
Subjects randomized to the MO group will be offered the opportunity to receive CBTi, by 
[CONTACT_756], upon completion of all study procedures.   However, we will allow these 
subjects more flexibility in the duration of CBTi.   In practice, there is no “magic nu mber” 
of sessions. Some patients get better quickly, and some take longer.   Therefore we 
would like to allow subjects randomized to the MO group who elect to receive CBTi by 
[CONTACT_525468] r 6-[ADDRESS_682018] already been in the study 8 weeks prior 
to starting CBTi filing out sleep diaries and other study questionnaires.  
  
Some subjects find that, after a few sessions, CBTi is not for them.   In practice, we find 
that these are the subjects who become non -compliant with the therapy (e.g., do not 
follow the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]'s recommendations and prescriptions).   Therefore, we will allow 
subjects originally randomized to the MO group who elect to receive CBTi after the 
study but are non -compliant with CBTi the opportunity to stop therapy if both they and 
the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_525454].  
  
We will request participants refrain from having elective surgery, sta rting, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and/or changing their medication or medication dose within 1 month of starting CBTi 
and during CBTi.   We will also ask participants refrain from missing more than 2 CBTi 
sessions.

protocol.  
 
VII. Statistical Analysis:  
• Linear mixed models with random effects for subjects will be used to analyze all 
available data for the intent -to-treat an alysis.   Because sex will be used as a 
stratification variable in the randomization procedure, it will not be included as a 
covariate the analyses.  
• Treatment effects will be estimated from post -treatment group differences using 
mixed models adjusting for b aseline scores on each outcome.  Standardized 
effect sizes will be calculated by [CONTACT_525469].

much,  if any, caffeine,  alcohol  and/or  medications  you took as well as how 
fatigued  you felt that day. Each  morning  you will record  your estimated  sleep 
time and the number  of times  you woke  up during  the night.  The sleep  diary 
will take approximately  5 minutes  total to complete  each  day. 
o You will be asked  to complete  some  self-report  questionnaires  about  your 
health,  mood,  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_525459],  and GWI symptoms.  These  questionnaires 
will take about 50 minutes to complete. You will be asked to mail the 
questionnaires  back  to usin  a pre-addressed,  pre-stamped  envelope.  
• You will be randomly  assigned  (i.e., randomized)  to one of two groups.  One group 
will undergo  CBTi by  [CONTACT_525471]  a week  for [ADDRESS_682026]  a 50-50 chance  of 
being  in either  group  (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a coin).  You will not be able to choose  the group 
to which you are  assigned.  
What will happen if I am assigned to the CBTi group?  
• Participants  in the CBTi  group  will undergo  8 weekly  CBTi  sessions  with a sleep 
coach (i.e., Masters or Doctoral level mental health professional). Each  session 
will last approximately 30 – 90 minutes.  
• During the CBTi sessions the sleep coach will give you information about the 
science  of sleep  as well as instructions  and strategies  that may help you resolve 
your problems  of falling  and staying  asleep  and/or  improve  the quality  of your 
sleep.  
• During  the 8 weeks  of CBTi  you will continue  to fill out the Sleep  Diary  each 
evening  and morning.  
• On week  4 of CBTi  and after completing  CBTi,  you will be asked  to fill out some 
more self-report questionnaires (on paper to be mailed back to us in a pre - 
stamped, self -addressed  envelope).  
• Six months  after finishing  CBTi,  you will again  be asked  to keep  a Sleep  Diary  for 
1 week  and to fill out some  self-report  questionnaires  (to be mailed  back  to us in a 
pre-stamped, self -addressed  envelope).  
 
What will happen if I am assigned to the Usual Activities group?  
• The purpose  of the Usual  Activities  group  is to allow  us to compare  the effects  of 
those  of receiving  CBTi  by [CONTACT_525472]. 
For this reason,  participants  in the Usual  Activities  group  will be asked  to maintain 
their normal  daily  routine  for 8 weeks  and to fill out a Sleep  Diary  during  this time 
• On week  4, you will be asked  to fill out some  self-report  questionnaires  (which  you 
will mail back  to us in a pre-stamped,  self-addressed  envelope).

• On week 9, you will again be asked to fill out some self -report questionnaires 
(which  you will mail back  to us in a pre-stamped,  self-addressed  envelope).  After 
we receive  your self-report questionnaires,  you will be offered  the opportunity  to 
begin  8 weeks  of telephone  delivered  CBTi,  described  above.  
 
What will happen after the 8 weeks of CBTi or Usual Activities?  
• You will be asked  to complete  some  self-report  questionnaires  about  your health, 
mood,  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_525459],  and GWI symptoms  (which  you will mail back  to us in a 
pre-stamped, pre -addressed  envelope).  
• If you were  assigned  to the CBTi  group,6  months  later you will be asked  to keep  a 
Sleep  Diary  for one week  and to complete  some  self -report  questionnaires  about 
your health, mood, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_47677], and GWI symptoms (which you will mail 
back to us in a pre -stamped, pre -addressed  envelope).  
• If you were  assigned  to the Usual  Activities  group,  you will have  the option  to 
begin  8-weeks  of CBTi  with our sleep  coach  at no cost to you.  
 
Where will the study take place?  
• Although  the study  staff (e.g.,  recruiter,  clinical  interviewer,  and sleep  coach)  are 
located  at the San Francisco  VA Medical center,  all the study  procedures  will be 
conducted  over the telephone  or by [CONTACT_2319].  Therefore,  you do not have  to come  to 
San Francisco  to participate.  You can participate  from  nearly  anywhere  (such  as 
your home).  
• The self-report  questionnaires  can be completed  anywhere,  and you will be asked 
mail it back to us in a pre -stamped, pre -addressed envelope.  
 
How long will I be in this study?  
• All participants  will be in the study  for at least  10 weeks.  This includes:  
o 1 week  of monitoring  sleep  habits  by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_007]  a sleep  diary  and filling  out 
some self -report questionnaires before  randomization  
o 8 weeks  of telephone  delivered  CBTi  or 8 weeks  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a sleep  diary 
and doing  your usual  activities.  
o 1 week  of monitoring  sleep  habits  with a sleep  diary  and filling  out some 
self-report questionnaires.  
• Participants  assigned  to the CBTi  group  will be asked  to repeat  the post-treatment 
assessments 6 months after finishing CBTi to help us determine the long-term 
effects  of telephone  delivered  CBTi.  
• Participants  assigned  to the Usual  Activities  group  will have  the opportunity  to 
undergo  [ADDRESS_682028]-study  assessments

Can I continue with other treatments while I am in the study?  
• Yes, you may continue  any other  treatments you  are receiving  for GWI during  the 
study.  However,  you will be asked  to provide  information  about  any changes  in 
these  other  treatments  that take place  during  this study.  
 
Are there any risks with being in the study?  
• You may experience  some  discomforts  while  participating  in the study:  During  the 
course  of CBTi,  some  fatigue  and/or  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008],  and/or  memory  and concentration 
difficulties may occur, although they are usually limited to the first 1 -2 weeks of 
treatment. If the side effects become too bothersome or are uncontrollable, you 
are free to discontinue  CBTi  and withdraw  from the study  or the study  researcher 
may recommend  that you withdraw  from the study.  
• Everyone  taking  part in the study  will be watched  carefully  for any side effects. 
However,  there  may be side effects  that the doctors/sleep  coaches  do not know 
about.  Therefore,  you should  talk to your sleep  coach  about  any side effects  or 
discomforts  you experience  while  taking  part in the study.  The researchers  will let 
you know if they learn anything that might make you change your mind about 
participating in the  study.  
• To ensure  that you have  access  to immediate  attention  over the course  of the study,  
all study participants will be provided with the telephone numbers of the study 
researchers.  
• The clinical  interview  and/or  self-report  questionnaires  may be distressing  to some 
participants. You are free to decline to answer any questions or to stop the 
interviews  at any time.  The interviewer  will be available  to immediately  assist  with 
any problems  that arise  in the interview  and will make  a referral  if required.  
• The clinical  interviews  will be audio  taped  for quality  control  purposes.  The audio

    Feasibility and acceptability of a physical activity behavior change intervention  for Parkinson’s disease  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Study Protocol  November 15, [ADDRESS_1104350] in the study and then contact[CONTACT_800300]. Potential participants who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were also contact[CONTACT_800301]. The NRL PD registry contained contact [CONTACT_800302]-related studies at NRL. Finally, the study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Clinical Trials Registration [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) which led to it being posted on the Michael J Fox (MJF) Trial Finder. Participants were not excluded based on gender, class, or race.  This study took place in the Neurorehabilitation Research Lab (NRL) at Teachers College, Columbia University. Participants were included if they were: 1) between the ages of 18 and 85 years of age; 2) had a neurologist confirmed clinical diagnosis for Parkinson’s disease H&Y stage I or II 1; 3) able to ambulate indoor and outdoor without assistance or the use of an assistive device; 4) successful completion of the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q)2 safety screen or medical clearance from their general practitioner. The age group was limited, given the research questions to be addressed.  The incidence and prevalence of PD are 1.5–2 times greater in males than in females,3 thus we anticipated there would be a greater enrolment of men than women Participants were excluded if they (1) had a musculoskeletal injury that would prevent them from participating in an exercise program; (2) had another neurological disease or disorder such as stroke; or (3) if they were already engaging in aerobic exercise for at least [ADDRESS_1104351] cohort design was selected. The selected cohort is adults with early stage PD (H&Y I-II). An open cohort was selected to present less obstacles for attaining the desired sample size for the study. The design was prospective, which allowed the investigators to obtain baseline exposure data in real time and then follow the participants to measure the occurrence of the health outcome.4 In addition, there was a retrospective element to the design: the inclusion of post-intervention questionnaires designed to assess retrospective acceptability of the intervention.  Procedures Participants were consented to be screened over the phone and then screened for eligibility using the inclusion/exclusion criteria and PAR-Q. Participants were then scheduled individually to come to the NRL for their baseline assessments. Informed consent, baseline assessments and ActiGraph administration were carried out at week [ADDRESS_1104352] one-to-one session occurred on week 1, and subsequent sessions followed on week 2, 3, 6, 10, and 14. On the alternate weeks when there were no sessions, the participants were contact[CONTACT_800303]-ins. At week 15, the follow-up assessments and another ActiGraph were administered by [CONTACT_17033],. At week 16 the ActiGraph was returned via mail. See figure below for study schema diagram.

Intervention. The Pre-Active PD intervention underpi[INVESTIGATOR_800288] (see figure II for Logic Model).  The intervention was delivered by [CONTACT_63522] a licensed occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800289], PA coaching, and MI. For the intervention sessions, participants had the option of doing them in person at NRL or remotely via a secured web-based server, Zoom. One week following baseline measures, participants received their first of six one-to-one sessions that occurred over the following 14 weeks (week 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, and 14). The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800290]-in with the participant via phone or email to provide additional support and feedback on the weeks when the participant did not have one-to-one sessions (week 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13).  At the first session, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800291] – Exercise 2 (URICA-E2)5–[ADDRESS_1104353] used the MI techniques (described in chapter one) in alignment with the SDT in in order to facilitate progression through the TTM stages for PA behavior change. 8–[ADDRESS_1104354] asked the participant if they wanted to use the Fitbit (Charge 2 model) to monitor their PA. If the participant said yes, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800292] a pre-charged Fitbit device with charger. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800293], create a Fitbit account, sync the device to their smart phone, and explained how to use it. Before concluding, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800294].  After the participant left, their Fitbit account was set up with Fitabase program a web-based platform that integrates FitBit data from users (Small Steps Lab, Inc; San Diego, CA, [LOCATION_003]). During the intervention, participants' PA behaviors were monitored remotely through the Fitabase platform, whereby [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_800295]’ PA levels, and heart rate zones throughout the day. For each of the remaining five sessions, the goals were revisited, the Fitbit data was reviewed, and discussion ensued regarding participants’ successes or struggles, and themes from the Pre-Active PD workbook.   Assessments Demographic data and assessments were collected to illustrate the participant characteristics at baseline. Feasibility was assessed at follow-up in regards to the domains of acceptability and implementation (see table 1). Additional outcomes measures were administered at baseline and follow-up to assess effect estimates in the areas of self-efficacy, motivation, PA levels, and self-perception of performance and satisfaction (see table 2).   Participant Characteristics. At baseline, demographic data were recorded for each participant including age, gender, H&Y score, height, weight, date of diagnoses or onset of symptoms, and most affected side. In addition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)11 was administered at baseline. The MoCA is a 30-point cognitive screening instrument. A score of less than or equal to 26 is indicative of cognitive impairment.12 The MoCA was used to assess presence and severity of cognitive impairment. The University of Rhode Island continuous measure (URICA-E2)[ADDRESS_1104355] session to assess the participants’ readiness to change 
with regard to exercise behavior, based on the TTM stages of behavior change. The URICA-E2 is a 24-item, 5-point Likert-sale, questionnaire. Each item has a statement that reflects an intention toward exercise, with responses ranging from one “strongly disagree” to five “strongly agree”. Internal consistency of this questionnaire was 0.80 to 0.93. 6   Feasibility. Feasibility was assessed in regards to acceptability and implementation fidelity. Table 1 includes a summary of the feasibility measures, variable names, and the corresponding feasibility domain.  Table 1. Feasibility measures Feasibility Domain Outcome Measures Variable Name [CONTACT_800315]  ≥ 75% of sessions 1, 2 & [ADDRESS_1104356] follow-up Acceptability > 75% of participants retained at follow-up Retention Post follow-up Acceptability Fitbit Wear-time, or written logs PA log During intervention Acceptability Theoretical framework of acceptability questionnaire TFAQ 1x Follow-up Acceptability Perceived Autonomy Support Healthcare Climate Questionnaire (Williams, Freedman, & Deci, 1998) PAS-HCCQ 1x Follow-up Implementation Rating Tool to Assess Fidelity of Intervention Delivery [ADDRESS_1104357] follow-up  Adherence and Retention. Adherence was defined as the participant’s commitment to the Pre-Active PD program through continued participation. Participation in the one-to-one coaching sessions along with the Fitbit data provided insight to the level of adherence. An adherence rate of ≥ 75% of the participants completing session 1-3 and a retention rate of > 75% retained at follow-up were deemed appropriate to suggest feasibility of this intervention. This threshold for adherence was set relative to the number of visits required to discuss all content of the workbook, as modeled in the Engage-HD study.15  In addition, PA logs (i.e. Fitbit wear-time or written log) were also selected as it is recognized as a valid and acceptable method for measuring adherence. [ADDRESS_1104358] four days or more in over half the weeks during the intervention for any one of the components.    TFA Questionnaire (TFAQ). Informed by [CONTACT_800304] (TFA),17 the TFA Questionnaire (TFAQ) was designed to inductively evaluate the retrospective acceptability of the Pre-Active PD intervention for patients with early stage PD by [CONTACT_800305]. The TFAQ was not tested for reliability or validity. The TFAQ was designed to gather the participants’ thoughts and feedback regarding the intervention delivery and workbook post-intervention, and was administered once at the 15-week assessment. The TFAQ part I included 25-items, where participants were asked to rate each statement on a Likert scale from 1 
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with higher numbers indicating greater acceptability. Part I quantitatively measured 4 of the 7 theoretical constructs from the TFA: (1) affective attitude (how the participant feels about the intervention; items 1-4), (2) intervention coherence (the extent to which the participant understands the intervention and how it works; items 5-10), (3) perceived effectiveness (the extent to which the intervention is perceived as likely to achieve its purpose; items 11-18), and (4) self-efficacy (the participant’s confidence that they can perform the behaviors required to participate in the intervention; items 19-25). Specific questions for each TFA domain were constructed with respect to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (items 1-3, 10, and 15-17), workbook (items 4-8 and 11), and intervention as a whole (items 9, and 12-14). Acceptability was indicated by a total score higher than [ADDRESS_1104359], workbook, and overall impression. Part II of the TFAQ was optional and included open-ended questions to gather qualitative data from the participant’s experience and feedback for the Pre-Active PD intervention. Acceptability was indicated by a total score higher than 75 from the sum of items 1-25 on the TFAQ-part I.  Perceived Autonomy Support Health Care Climate Questionnaire (PAS-HCCQ). The PAS-HCCQ is a 15 item questionnaire18 designed to assess constructs encompassed within SDT as it applies to health-care behavior.19. The PAS-HCCQ items were marked by a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .96).[ADDRESS_1104360] was perceived to be autonomy supportive. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Scores were calculated by [CONTACT_800306]. As per instructions, before averaging the item scores, the score of item [ADDRESS_1104361] be “reversed” by [CONTACT_800307] 8. For example, the score of 3, when reversed would become 5. Higher average scores represent a higher level of perceived autonomy support.[ADDRESS_1104362] promoted the components of SDT (autonomy, relatedness, competence, and general impression). Four items were rated on a 0-[ADDRESS_1104363], who was not involved in the intervention delivery or the administration of the other assessments, was instructed on how to use the measure. The assessor viewed and rated 12 sessions (one from each participant), that had been previously recorded via Zoom. In addition to the ratings, the assessor identified quotes from the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_800296], relatedness, and competence.     
Efficacy outcome measures. Efficacy of the intervention was assessed in regards to effect estimates comparing pre and post intervention for physical activity, self-efficacy, motivation and self-performance of performance and satisfaction on goals. In addition to measures of feasibility and acceptability, there were two primary efficacy outcomes: 1) change from baseline in moderate vigorous physical activity using Actigraph, and 2) change from baseline in the relative autonomy index (RAI) of the behavioral regulation in exercise questionnaire (BREQ-2).  Table [ADDRESS_1104364] intervention Self-efficacy The Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale 22 Norman-SES 2x, Baseline and follow-up Motivation The Behavioral Regulation In Exercise Questionnaire 23 BREQ-2 2x, Baseline and follow-up Self-perception of Performance & Satisfaction Modified Canadian Occupational Performance Measure [ADDRESS_1104365] session   Physical Activity Levels. The Brunel-PAQ is a 10-item questionnaire that measures both pre-planned and un-planned lifestyle PA 21 The Brunel-PAQ was designed to provide an online behavioral assessment to be used in conjunction with a 12-week personalized fitness program delivered through the internet, and was found to be a valid and reliable instrument. 25. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for criterion validity of the behavioral intention items was α = .9325. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) estimates for the Brunel-PAQ subscales were α = .90 for Planned PA α = .90, and α = .68 for Unplanned PA. 25  The BRUNEL-PAQ defined planned PA for participants as: “any activity that is scheduled into your daily routine, which may enhance your health, fitness, or wellbeing.”.25 Examples were provided, including brisk walking, gardening, cycling, team games, etc. Responses to each item in the PA subscale were provided on a five-point categorical Likert-type scale (continuous closed numerical scale). For example, answer options for question one included: (1) never, (2) 1–2 times, (3) 3–4 times, (4) 5–6 times, (5) 7 or more times. Participants were asked to base their responses on what a typi[INVESTIGATOR_800297]. The 
planned PA subscale includes six items that were designed to measure the intensity, frequency, and duration of the identified activity. The unplanned PA subscale did not assess frequency because of its highly transient nature making it difficult to obtain validity.  The ActiGraph™ GT9X quantitatively measured PA levels (step count, MVPA levels, and sedentary behavior) to assess change before and after the intervention. Actigraphy is a non-invasive way of monitoring human rest/activity cycles and has been used to study PA levels and patterns in PwPD who have mild to moderate severity. 26–28 The ActiGraph™ GT9X is a reliable assessment of steps for PwPD or altered gait in both clinical and research evaluations. 29 The ActiGraph™ is an inertial measurement unit (IMU) which includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors to capture position and rotation, and wear time sensor. Participants were instructed to wear the ActiGraph™ secured on their hip by [CONTACT_800308]-on waist band on their hip for [ADDRESS_1104366] times when the ActiGraph™ was removed and put it back on. Participants were instructed to not wear the device in water, such as when bathing or during water sports.  Self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was measured by [CONTACT_800309]-Efficacy Scale (Norman-SES).[ADDRESS_1104367] that measures an individual’s self-efficacy to participate in exercise when numerous barriers are present, including both social and physical barriers. The measure employs a 5-point Likert scale for confidence, from 1 “not at all confident” to 5 “completely confident”, in the areas of negative affect (α = .853), excuse making (α = .829), must exercise alone (α = .869), inconvenient to exercise (α = .773), resistance from others (α = .853), and bad weather (α = .837). A score less than or equal to 54 indicated low self-efficacy (18 items x Likert score of 3 “neutral”), a score between 54 and 72 (18 items x Likert score of 4 “confident”), and a score between 72 and 90 (18 items x Likert score of 5 “completely confident”) indicates high self-efficacy.  Motivation. The Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-2) measures the stages of self-determination continuum with respect to motivation to exercise.23 It is a 19-item questionnaire, with a 5 point Likert scale from 0 “not true for me” to 4 “very true for me” for statements regarding PA engagement. For example, “I don’t see why I should have to exercise” (amotivation), “I exercise because other people say I should” (extrinsic), “I feel guilty when I don’t exercise” (introjected), “I value the benefits of exercise” (identified) and “I exercise because it is fun” (intrinsic). Acceptable internal consistency was previously demonstrated for the 5 subcategories: amotivation (items 5, 9, 12 & 19), external regulation α = .81 (items 1, 6, 11 & 16),, introjected regulation α = .79 (items 2, 7 & 13),, identified regulation α = .78 (items 3, 8, 14 & 17), and intrinsic motivation α = .93 (items 4, 10, 15 & 18). 30 A composite score of intrinsic motivation and identified regulation subscales represented autonomous motivation (α = .90). 30 A composite score of introjected regulation and external regulation represented controlled motivation (α = .78). 30 The BREQ-2 was scored by [CONTACT_800310]. Self-perception of Performance & Satisfaction. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)[ADDRESS_1104368] change in participant’s self-perception of occupational performance, in regards to performance and satisfaction, over time using two 10-point ordinal scales, with [ADDRESS_1104369] to: (1) 
identify problem areas in occupational performance; (2) provide a rating of the client’s priorities in occupational performance; (3) evaluate performance and satisfaction relative to those problem areas; (4) provide the basis for goal setting; and (5) measure changes in client’s perception of his/her occupational performance over the course of the intervention.  The COPM has demonstrated strong content and concurrent validity31 as well as test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation [ICC] .63 for performance, ICC .84 for satisfaction).[ADDRESS_1104370] to PwPD, it is assumed to be valid for PwPD and recommended by [CONTACT_800311]/National Parkinson Foundation (NPF) in their Guidelines for Occupational Therapy in Parkinson’s Disease Rehabilitation. [ADDRESS_1104371] session. The mCOPM total scores were calculated by [CONTACT_800312] (scores range from 1-10), then dividing by [CONTACT_800313] (3 or 4), to give the average score. This was done for both performance and satisfaction ratings separately. The average score was calculated for both the first and final session. The post-pretest change score was calculated by [CONTACT_800314]. To date, research suggests that a change of 2 or more points represents a clinically important change.37,38    Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics summarized the participant characteristics and the results of the outcome measures. IBM’s Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 26; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, [LOCATION_003]) was used for inferential statistical analyses. Feasibility was evaluated in terms of acceptability and implementation. Percentages were reported for adherence and retention rates. Descriptive statistics were reported for the TFAQ-part I; the Perceived Autonomy Support Healthcare Climate Questionnaire (PAS-HCCQ)18; and fidelity rating tool14.  Percentage of participants who selected Fitbit as their primary PA log was reported. Descriptive statistics were calculated for Fitbit data with regards to total percentage of time worn and daily step counts for the first and last 7 days. Data from the FitBit devices were synced with Fitabase program to provide sync events, wear time, number of steps per day, and moderate-vigorous activity. The data were downloaded into a .csv file for all participants for the duration of their intervention (16 weeks).  Aggregate data were then calculated to provide mean and SD for all metrics Descriptive statistics were calculated for the outcome measures for baseline and follow-up: PA levels (Brunel-PAQ and ActiGraph™), exercise self-efficacy (Norman-SES), motivation to exercise (BREQ-2), and self-perception of performance & satisfaction of goals (mCOPM). The mean difference between the baseline and follow-up was then calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d39, with d = 0.[ADDRESS_1104372] size, d =  0.[ADDRESS_1104373] size, and d = 0.[ADDRESS_1104374] size. 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for participants in the different stages of exercise behavior change (URICA-E2) with regards to their changes in exercise self-efficacy (Norman-SES) and planned PA (Brunel-PAQ). Descriptive statistics were also calculated for changes in kinds of PAs enjoyed (Brunel-PAQ) from baseline to follow-up. ActiGraph™ findings were calculated with regards to percentage of time spent in sedentary activity, percentage of time in MVPA, and daily step count.  The accelerometry data were preprocessed as accelerometer data files (AGD files) using ActiLife software (ActiLife v6.13.2; Pensacola, FL, 2016) and then converted to CSV files with 60-second epochs. Participants with less than 4 days (and a minimum of 1 weekend day) of 10 hours per day of wear time were excluded from the results. Based on the results of earlier studies, 60 minutes of consecutive zero counts were classified as non-wear time. Non-wear time was excluded from calculations for each individual. Correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the relationship between: post-pretest change scores of planned PA and self-efficacy; baseline self-efficacy scores and follow-up planned-PA times; and post-pretest change scores of planned PA and unplanned PA and BREQ-2 measures of amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, and intrinsic regulation.

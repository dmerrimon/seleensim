 The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects in the MITT population who do 
not have major protocol deviations considered to affect the  primary efficacy variable DRSS, 
have completed a minimum of [ADDRESS_498831] 70% compliant. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variables will be conducted using the PP 
population.  
Sample Size  
Estimates for sample size calculations are derived from published data from the analysis of the effect of ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and aflibercept (Eylea®) intravitreal administration 
regimens on DR severity score in the RISE/RIDE studies and VIVID/VISTA studies, 
respectively, in which 28-46% of subjects improved by ≥ 2 steps after 12 months of 
treatment.    
With 45 evalua ble subjects per treatment group, the study has > 85% power (based on 
Fisher’s Exact Test and a 2 -sided alpha =0.05 ) to demonstrate a statistically significant 
improvement in p roportion  of subjects improving by ≥ 2 steps on the ETDRS severity scale, 
assuming underlying rates for active and placebo of 30% and 5%, respectively. Assuming 
10% drop- out/non -evaluable rate, a sample size of 50 subjects per treatment arm 
(approximately 150 total) has been selected.  
Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_396555]. Summaries will be presented for both the MITT and PP populations.  The primary hypotheses to be tested is that AKB -[ADDRESS_498832] as measured by [CONTACT_396556] 12 months.  The primary hypotheses will be 
tested in the MITT population using a Fisher’s  Exact Test with a 2 -sided 5% significance 
level. To adjust for multiplicity, a pre -specified testing order will be used. AKB -[ADDRESS_498833] of the study, multiple layers of planned safety 
monitoring will be conducted. These include weekly masked reviews by [CONTACT_396557], monthly masked reviews by [CONTACT_396558] (CSRT ), and 
quarterly masked reviews by [CONTACT_396559] s are detailed in 
a separate document  (AKB -9778 Safety Surveillance Plan).

Page [ADDRESS_498840] 8.3% of the adult population, 382 million people worldwide, and 
this number is expected to rise to 592 million people by 2035 ( Guariguata et al ., 2014) . Diabetic 
retinopathy (DR) is a frequent complication of diabetes that may result in blindness. The 
incidence of DR increases with duration of diabetes. The prevalence of DR in the diabetic population is approximately 33%, with approximately 10% having vision threatening conditions of macular edema or proliferative retinopathy ( Yau et al ., 2012). By 20 years after disease 
diagnosis, nearly 100% of type 1 diabetics and 60% of type [ADDRESS_498841] ( Fong et al ., 
2004a,b). In the Wisconsin Epi[INVESTIGATOR_396529], the 25- year cumulative rate of 
retinopathy progression in Type 1 diabetics was 83%, with 43% of this population progressing to proliferative retinopathy (Klein et al., 2008) and 29% progressing to macular edema (Klein et al., 
2009). Based on these data, it is clear that diabetic retinopathy will increase as a public health problem, with both aging of the US population and increasing prevalence of diabetes over time.  
The severity of DR has been standardized using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS ) grading of standard 7-field fundus photographs. There is extensive evidence to show 
that as DR severity increases, the likelihood of development of macular edema or high- risk 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) increases ( Davis et al ., 1998; Klein et al ., 2001). Thus, 
early detection and treatment of DR would dramatically reduce both visual disability associated with diabetes as well as the impact of this visual loss on health economics.  
In pi[INVESTIGATOR_396530]- VEGF  (vascular endothelial growth factor) effects on diabetic 
macular edema ( DME ), it was observed that treatment also had beneficial effects on DR. After 1 
year of treatment with Eylea ®, 33.5% of subjects treated monthly and 28.4% of subjects treated 
bi-monthly improved by ≥ 2 steps on the ETDRS severity scale, compared to 10.9% in the laser treatment group ( Korobelnik et al., 2014).  Similarly, in the RISE and RIDE trials with 
Lucentis®, 46.9% of subjects treated with 0.3 mg monthly and 46.8% of subjects treated with 
0.5 mg monthly for 2 years had a ≥ [ADDRESS_498842], compared to 6.8% of subjects treated with sham injections ( Ip et al ., 2012
). There was also a decrease in the percent of subjects 
who worsened by ≥ 2 steps after 2 years of treatment (2.5%, 2.0%, and 12.4% in the 0.3 mg 
Lucentis, 0.5 mg Lucentis, and sham groups, respectively). On the basis of these data, Lucentis 
and Eylea have been approved  for the treatment of DR  in patients with DME . However, t he 
efficacy of anti -VEGF therapy for the treatment of DR in patients without center -involved DME 
is unproven. Two trials have recently been initiated to test the efficacy of Eylea in this 
population (the PANORAMA study - [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] sponsored by [CONTACT_112608]; and Protocol W - 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] sponsored by [CONTACT_377432].net). However, it is important to note that eyes with non-
proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) and no DME have little visual dysfunction and thus 
the burden of multiple binocular intravitreal anti- VEGF injections may be unacceptable in this 
population. The objective of the present study is to examine the efficacy of AKB -[ADDRESS_498843]. AKB -9778 is a small molecule Tie2 (tyrosine kinase with 
immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 2) activator that works through inhibition of VE -
PTP (vascular endothelial-protein tyrosine phosphatase), otherwise known as HPTPβ (human protein tyrosine phosphatase β), enhancing Tie2 activation and signaling.  Tie2 is a receptor

Tie2/angiopoietin pathway has been identified as a key modulator of endothelial function and vascular stability (Augustin et al., 2009; Milner et al., 2009; Brindle et al., 2006; Fiedler et al., 
2006; Peters et al., 2004).  Members of the angiopoietin family are ligands for Tie2; angiopoietin 
1 (Ang1) is an agonist and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) functions as a context dependent antagonist.  The bulk of evidence indicates that Ang1/Tie2 signaling promotes normal vascular integrity.  Conversely, in settings where Ang2 is upregulated, as in patients with diabetic retinopathy, Tie2 signaling is blunted and the vasculature is destabilized promoting vascular leak and enabling pathologic angiogenesis.   
VE-PTP is an endothelial tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates Tie2, further reducing Tie2 
signaling.  Inhibition of VE -PTP with AKB -9778 overrides Ang2 and restores Tie2 signaling. 
Importantly, AKB-9778- mediated Tie2 activation results in activation of the PI3 
kinase/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway, a critical pathway in maintaining 
endothelial function and vascular integrity. Thus, AKB-9778 promotes vascular stability through enhanced Tie2 activation resulting in improved endothelial function, reduced vascular lea k and 
inflammation, and resistance to pathologic angiogenesis.  
In multiple preclinical vascular disease models, vascular stabilizing effects of AKB -9778 
resulted in decreased vascular leak and/or suppression of pathologic neovascularization.  In 
models of retinopathy, AKB-9778 dramatically reduced VEGF- driven retinal edema and 
neovascularization and prevented retinal detachment ( Shen et al ., 2014).  The vascular stabilizing 
properties of AKB-[ADDRESS_498845] been performed with AKB-9778, evaluating 
respectively 1 month and 3 months of treatment ( Campochiaro et al ., 2015, 2016). AKB -9778 
was well tolerated in these studies with no safety issues identified. The completed TIME -2 Proof 
of Concept study ( Campochiaro, 2016) has shown that SC dosing of AKB-9778 15 mg twice 
daily ( BID) may be of value in the treatment of DME when used in conjunction with Standard of 
Care anti -VEGF therapy and that AKB-[ADDRESS_498846] and no center -involved macular edema.

 4.2 Summary of Nonclinical Experience  
Please see the AKB -9778 Investigator Brochure for additional discussion and information for 
the following section. 
A comprehensive nonclinical program has been conducted with AKB-9778 including evaluation 
in multiple retinopathy models, safety pharmacology studies, pharmacokinetic ( PK) and 
metabolism studies, toxicology studies in rats , dogs, and monkeys, embryo- fetal development 
studies in rats and rabbits, and genotoxicity studies.  The nonclinical program conducted to  date 
supports evaluation of the intended 15 mg QD and BID AKB-9778 hydroxypropyl- beta-
cyclodextrin ( HPβCD) dose formulation regimens  for a duration of 12 months in the current 
clinical study .  Please see the AKB -9778 Investigator Brochure for additional information.  
AKB -9778 has excellent SC bioavailability and demonstrates linear, dose-dependent inc reases in 
exposure following SC administration in rats, dogs and monkeys.  
In the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) nonclinical safety studies, AKB-9778 formulated as a 
solution in 10% HPβCD demonstrated an excellent safety profile and was well tolerated by [CONTACT_344598], dogs, and monkeys. The primary target tissues for AKB-9778 were identified as injection sites  and l iver in rat, dog and monkey; skin/subcutis (vascular) in dog and 
monkey; and gastrointestinal ( GI; vascular) in dog.  
In the 6-month rat study elevations in AST and ALT were correlated with microscopic observations of scattered, individual, minimally necrotic hepatocytes. Similar findings were observed in the shorter duration (28- and 91-day) rat studies. In dogs, adverse liver findings have only been observed in the 28-day toxicity study, at the high dose, and included one incidence of mild randomly distributed foci of mild necrosis, associated with centrilobular vacuolation; non-adverse findings included hepatocellular degeneration also associated with centrilobular vacuolation, and one incidence of mild, randomly distributed microgranulomas in the liver. 
In the dog 9-month study, reversible, non-adverse and minimal panlobular hypertrophy of the 
liver was observed in all dose groups without any associated changes in liver transaminases.  In 
the 28-day monkey study there was no test article- related mortality and no definitive test article -
related mortality in the 273 -day monkey study. In the 273-day study, one of the 16 monkeys at 
22.5 mg/kg (33 -fold the clinical exposure at 15 mg BID) was sacrificed on Day [ADDRESS_498847] different processes and/or 
pathogenesis for the liver effects in each species.  For guidance on assessment and monitoring of 
potential liver findings refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
In rat, dog, and monkey, injection sites had findings related to the subcutaneous injection procedure (repeated injection of a limited number of injection sites on animals) with exacerbation by [CONTACT_396560] -9778.  SC injections of AKB-9778 as a solution in these 
nonclinical studies were generally well tolerated by [CONTACT_116434], dogs and monkeys with only sporadic or transient observation of injection si te redness, thickening, or  scabbing. These findings were 
correlated histopathologically with focal SC hemorrhage, inflammation, fibrosis, and necrosis that were observed to largely recover. In early clinical trials with the AKB -9778 HPβCD

 formulation , few adverse effects at the injection site were reported for injection volumes of less 
than 1 mL and mild to moderate transient pain was reported for injection volumes of 1 mL or 
greater.  
In the 9-month dog toxicity study, broadly distributed dermal- localized n odules were observed 
on all dogs at 15 and 30 mg/kg/day and one nodule was observed on one male dog at 6 mg/kg/day. The majority of nodules were identified microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_396531], characterized as ectatic, blood -filled vessels with varying de grees of thrombosis that was 
occasionally associated with papi[INVESTIGATOR_396532]; and  one nodule in a high dose dog 
identified as benign hemangioma. The nodules ranged in size between [ADDRESS_498848]- localized 
minimal to mild angiectasis was observed  by [CONTACT_396561] 
(at exposures 6 - to 24-fold the human exposure at 15 mg BID) and not present in the vehicle 
control group. The vascular findings were not associated with any clinical observ ations, serum 
chemistry, or other microscopic changes. In the rat 6 -month study, minimal focal angiectasis was 
observed by [CONTACT_396562]- dose rat (at higher 
AUC exposure than exposures assessed in dog) and was considered incidental .  There were no 
skin nodules or GI-related findings in rat. In the [ADDRESS_498849] been observed in 
clinical studies with AKB -9778. For guidance on assessment and monitoring of potential 
vascular effects refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
A consistent finding in both rat and dog was a non-adverse decrease in blood pressure. In normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), blood pressure was decreased (the decrease in systolic pressure was greater than the decrease in diastolic pressure [systolic > diastolic]) with a compensatory increase in heart rate. Similarly, in the dog cardiovascular (CV) study, blood pressure was decreased (systolic > diastolic) with a compensatory increase in heart rate. Changes in blood pressure in both species were transient (4-6 hours), correlated with the drug plasma profile, and appeared to plateau with increasing dose, consistent with a pharmacological effect. As mentioned previously, activation of Tie2 results in endothelial nitric ox ide synthase (eNOS ) activation, which generates the potent vasodilator, 
nitric oxide ( NO). AKB -9778 activates Tie2 and eNOS in cultured vascular endothelial cells, 
which supports a pharmacologic basis for vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.  
Another consistent finding in dog was a non- adverse increase in cholesterol and triglycerides  
without microscopic correlate . These changes resolved during the recovery period and were not 
associated with microscopic changes . In early clinical trials with AKB -9778, no clinically 
meaningful changes in clinical chemistry (including total cholesterol and triglycerides) have 
been observed.

 4.3 Summary of AKB-9778 Clinical Experience 
Please see the AKB -9778 Investigator Brochure for additional discussion and information for 
the following section. 
To date, AKB-9778 has been evaluated in six  completed early phase studies: a Phase 1a single 
ascending dose ( SAD) study ( AKB -9778- CI-2001) in healthy male volunteers, a Phase 1  
pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic crossover single dose study of an extended release 
suspension formulation ( AKB -9778- CI-3001), a 1-month Phase 1b multiple ascending dose 
(MAD) study in subjects with DME (AKB -9778- CI-2002 ), a 3-month Phase 2a POC study in 
subjects with DME (AKB -9778- CI-2003), a Phase 1  pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic 
crossover single dose study evaluating extended release solution and suspension formulations 
(AKB -9778- CI-3002); and a Phase 1 repeat -dose, PK/tolerability study evaluating exte nded 
release solution formulations ( AKB -9778- CI-3003 ). AKB -9778 is also being evaluated in two 
ongoing studies : a single -center, 3 -month Phase 2a POC study in subjects with retinal vein 
occlusion ( RVO) ( AKB -9778- CI-4001) and a Phase 1 ADME study (AKB-9778- CI-3004).  
The initial Phase 1a study, (Study AKB-9778- CI-2001) was a double-masked, placebo 
controlled, SAD study conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 6 single ascending subcutaneous doses of AKB-9778 including one administered as a divided dose in healthy male volunteers. Six cohorts of eight subjects each were randomized to receive either AKB -9778 or placebo (6:2). AKB-9778 doses evaluated over 
a single day of dosing were 5, 10.5, 20, 40, or 80 mg administered as a single dose, or 120 mg [(administered as 2 doses, 60 mg each, separated by 12 hours (i.e. 60 mg BID)]. Exposure following single ascending doses of AKB-9778 was dose proportional with no evidence of accumulation when administered as 2 doses separated by 12 hours (60 mg BID). Absorption and elimination were rapid (T
max ~ 15 -30 minutes and T 1/2 ~ 1-2 hours). Single doses of AKB-9778 
through 40 mg were generally well tolerated. At doses of 60, 80, and 120 mg (60 mg BID), an increase in the type and frequency of systemic AEs consistent with the exaggerated vasodilatory pharmacology of AKB- [ADDRESS_498850]-dose. At doses ≥ 60 mg, orthostatic symptomology observed during a 
3-5 minute standing blood pressure (BP) assessment improved upon return of subjects to supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], and resolved by 1-[ADDRESS_498851]-dose without treatment other than oral fluids. There were no severe or serious adverse events (SAEs) and no clinically significant changes or trends in safety laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, vital signs (except orthostatic 
BP), or physical exams in AKB -9778 or placebo treated subjects. 
Study AKB -9778- CI-2002, a Phase 1b, open-label, MAD cohort study, was conducted to assess 
the safety, tolerability, pi[INVESTIGATOR_396533], PK and pharmacodynamic ( PD) effects of 28 -day repeat 
subcutaneous doses of AKB-9778 in subjects with DME. Four dose cohorts were administered 5, 
15, 22.5 and 30 mg AKB -9778 BID, respectively. Twenty- six subjects in total were enrolled. 
Consistent with plasma exposure profiles in the healthy volunteer study, exposure in DME subjects increased with increasing dose levels of AKB -9778 with no evidence of significant 
accumulation. Absorption and eliminati on were rapid with an elimination half -life of 
approximately 1 hour. All AKB- 9778 doses were generally well tolerated. There were no SAEs. 
Adverse events, consistent with the exaggerated vasodilatory pharmacology of AKB-9778, emerged at AKB -9778 doses of 22.5 and 30 mg BID and included dizziness, headache, and 
presyncope/syncope. These events were transient, usually occurred within the first hour after

 dosing, and generally resolved within 5 minutes to one hour after onset. There were no clinically 
meaningf ul abnormalities or changes from baseline in safety laboratory tests (chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis), ECG parameters, vital signs or physical exams. In the 22.[ADDRESS_498852] decreases in resting systolic BP (with corresponding modest increases in heart rate (HR)) were observed following dosing (30 mg >22.5 mg). These effects were largely asymptomatic and transient, and the timing of the effects correlated with the rapid AKB-[ADDRESS_498853] that AKB-9778 exhibited biologic activity.  
AKB -9778- CI-2003 was a Phase 2 proof of concept ( POC ) study which further explored the 
efficac y of AKB -9778 in DME when administered for 3 months. In this trial, AKB-9778 was 
evaluated as monotherapy (subcutaneous administration of 15 mg BID), and in combination with ranibizumab intravitreal (IVT) injection. A ranibizumab active control group was a lso evaluated. 
AKB -9778 was well tolerated in subjects when administered BID either as monotherapy or as 
combination therapy with monthly ranibizumab IVT injection. There were no meaningful imbalances among treatment groups in either ocular or non- ocular treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), and no deaths or treatment- related SAEs were reported. Transient effects on 
baseline BP and HR following Day 1 dosing were observed, but the effects were not of clinical concern, and after 3 months (end of treatment), there were no differences in BP and HR between treatment groups. Hematology and blood chemistry did not yield clinically meaningful results for any treatment group, and clinically significant changes in physical examination, slit- lamp 
biomicroscopy parameters, intraocular pressure evaluations, and indirect dilated ophthalmoscopy evaluations were few and distributed similarly among treatment groups. When used in combination with ranibizumab, AKB- 9778 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
in the reduction of central subfield thickness ( CST) that also was statistically significantly 
greater than the improvement seen in the use of ranibizumab alone. Analysis of diabetic retinopathy severity score (DRSS) showed evidence that AKB -[ADDRESS_498854] on DRSS similar to ranibizumab ( Campochiaro et al., 2016).  
The previously described studies utilized an AKB-9778 formulation prepared using HPβCD as a solubilizing agent. A recently completed Phase 1 SAD study, AKB-9778- CI-3002, evaluated the 
safety, tolerability and bioavailability of an AKB-9778 solution formulation utilizing 1.5% benzyl alcohol (BA) as a solubiliz ing agent relative to AKB -9778 in 12.5% HPβCD.   
Study AKB -9778- CI-3002, conducted in healthy subjects, evaluated the single-dose PK, 
hemodynamic effects (BP and HR), and the safety and tolerability of two dose levels (15 and 30 mg) of AKB -9778 containing 1.5% BA relative to 15 mg AKB-9778 containing 12.5% HPβCD. 
All formulations and doses evaluated in the study were safe and well tolerated. Similar to the results of the previous clinical studies, all formulations and doses of AKB-[ADDRESS_498855] hour after dosing.  
Study AKB -9778- CI-3003, conducted in healthy subjects, evaluated 7-day BID subcutaneous 
administration of three different formulations of AKB-9778. In this study a 1.5% BA formu lation was used to test 15 mg and 30 mg doses of AKB-9778, a 3.0% BA formulation was 
used to test 30 mg, 45 mg, and 60 mg AB-9778 doses, and a 12.5% HPβCD formulation was used to test 15 mg AKB-9778. Placebo injections of 1.5% BA and 3.0% BA were also tested. All

 doses were given subcutaneously BID for 7 days (volume 0.75 ml). The trial was randomized 
and double-masked.  The 15 mg AKB-9778 in 12.5% HPβCD formulation was well tolerated both systemically and locally.  The AKB-9778 in BA formulations, while be ing well tolerated 
systemically, demonstrated injection site reactions (mild to moderate in intensity) in at least 2 subjects in each of the treatment arms.  Injection site reactions were also observed in the 3% BA vehicle arm.  Therefore, the current stud y will evaluate the AKB -[ADDRESS_498856] in the absence of center -involved DME when administered QD 
or BID for 12 months (48 weeks).

 associated with centrilobular vacuolation; non- adverse findings included hepatocellular 
degeneration also ass ociated with centrilobular vacuolation, and one incidence of mild, randomly 
distributed microgranulomas in the liver . In the dog chronic 9-month study, reversible, non-
adverse and minimal panlobular hypertrophy of the liver was observed in all dose groups without 
any associated changes in liver transaminases. In the monkey chronic 9-month study, one of the 
16 monkeys at 22.5 mg/kg (33-fold the clinical exposure at 15 mg BID) was sacrificed on Day 109 with cholestatic liver injury and associated anemia which  developed over a minimum of 
several weeks. In prior AKB -9778 clinical trials, in subjects treated for 3 months with AKB-
9778 15mg BID, 0/113 had transaminase (ALT or AST) elevation >5X upper limit of normal (ULN) at any monthly assessment timepoint; 1/113  subjects (1/16 RVO patients; 0/97 DME 
patients) had a single occurrence of asymptomatic ALT elevation >3X but < 5X ULN at the end of treatment. This subject had an ALP slightly above ULN at pre-treatment and 2.05X ULN at the end of treatment, with all oth er labs (including AST, bilirubin and total protein) normal 
throughout the study. ALT and ALP levels were normal on repeat assessment 4 weeks later.  The rate of LFT findings observed to date in patients treated with AKB-9778 is in the range reported for p lacebo groups in clinical trials (Llanos et al, 2010), particularly given the absence of any 
cases associated with elevated bilirubin levels.   
In the subchronic (28-day) dog and monkey studies, decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed at the h igh doses with no microscopic correlate and were considered possibly 
associated with effects at the injection sites.   However, in the chronic rat, dog and monkey 
studies, except for the single monkey described above with cholestatic liver injury and associated 
anemia, decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were not observed. Non -adverse increases in 
cholesterol and triglycerides were observed in dogs in all pi[INVESTIGATOR_396534]. These changes resolved within the recovery per iods.  No significant 
hematologic or plasma lipid abnormalities were observed in the 9 -month monkey study. In all 
clinical trials with AKB -9778 to date, no clinically meaningful changes in hematological 
parameters (including hemoglobin and hematocrit) or plasma lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (including total cholesterol and triglycerides) have been observed.   
Dermal  nodules, characterized microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_396535] (dilated, blood filled vessels),  
have been observed in the chronic 9-month dog toxicity stud y and with a single incidence in one 
high-dose monkey in the chronic 9-month monkey study; however, no unusual dermal findings 
have been observed in human clinical studies of durations of up to [ADDRESS_498859]  after the 9 -month dosing 
period. These changes were asymptomatic (i.e. there was no bleeding, loss of appetite, or other 
observable clinical abnormalities of the GI tract)  at exposures up to 24-fold above the human 
clinical exposure.   
The current clinical study employs robust safety monitoring to assess for potential adverse effects.  Safety assessments in the current study include body system assessments , vital sign 
monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments (including blood chemistry, hematology, fecal occult blood testing, and urinalysis), vision and ocular assessments.   
On an ongoing basis throughout the conduct of the study, a variety of planned safety monitoring 
reviews of available study data will be conducted (as detailed in Section 6.4 Oversight of Safety 
and in the AKB -9778 Safety Surveillance Plan ).  These include weekly reviews conducted by [CONTACT_396563]. AKB -9778- CI-5001   18September2017

6 STUDY DESIGN  
6.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled, multi- center study, to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of 12 months (48 weeks) of subcutaneous AKB-[ADDRESS_498864]. Exploratory evaluations include 
pharmacokinetic assessments, as well as exploratory efficacy assessments ( OCT -A, UWF 
imaging  and non- invasive ERG) at a subset of sites . Blood samples will be retained for 
biomarker and genetic analysis.    
 
Subjects wi ll participate in the study for approximately 56 weeks  (Screening period up to 4 
weeks , Baseline and Treatment periods for 4 8 weeks , and Follow-up period for 4 weeks ). 
The study will be conducted at approximately 50 investigative sites.   
Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1  to either AKB -9778 15mg QD, AKB -9778 15mg BID, or 
placebo treatment groups .  Fifty  (50) subjects are planned per group.  The treatment groups are 
as follows:  
• Active Group: SC AKB -9778 15 mg (QD); To maintain masking, subjects will receive 
BID dosing with masked study medication a dministered as one dose of active and one 
dose of matching placebo  
• Active Group: SC AKB -9778 15 mg ( BID)  
• Placebo Group: SC Phosphate-B uffered -Saline (P BS) (BID)  
Subjects will self -administer study medication as SC injections in the abdomen (preferably) 
around the same time every morning and evening, if possible (See Section 8.3.5).  The 
Investigator, all study -site personnel, Central Image Reading Center  personnel, and subjects will 
be masked to treatment assignment during the entirety of the study.  
For safety monitoring throughout the conduct of the study, o cular image data (fundus 
photographs, including red free images, fluorescein angiography, and OCT) for both the study 
and fellow eye will be read locally by [CONTACT_737].   
All ocular image data will be transmitted to a Central Image Reading Center.  Modified 7- Field 
or 4-Wide Field color fundus photos will be graded for ETDRS DRSS by [CONTACT_396565].  The Central Image Reading center will confirm study eye eligibility based on 
ocular imaging criteria.  The Central Image Reading Center  will provide the Screening DRSS 
value to investigative sites which will be used for randomization stratification based on Screening photos (See Section 8.3.2).  Ocular images analyzed at the Central Image Reading

Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_396566]  (levels 43, 47 and 53 
equally distributed between the treatment groups). The number of study eyes with moderate 
severity of DR (level 43) will be limited to 50 .   
Spot UACR  and eGFR  will be assessed as exploratory assessments to evaluate for any potential 
effects on renal function . UACR will be evaluated at Baseline, Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12 
(EOT) . eGFR will be evaluated at Screening, Baseline , Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12 (EOT). 
Plasma samples will be collected at specified times on Day 1  and Month 6 visit for PK 
assessments.  These samples will be analyzed for AKB -9778 using validated bioanalytical 
methods. A blood sample will be retained for exploratory genetic analysis that may provide insight into the 
role of the VE -PTP/ Tie2 pathway in diabetic retinopathy and an individual subject's response to 
AKB -9778 treatment. Similarly, blood samples collected at baseline and Month 12 End of 
Treatment (EOT) will be retained for exploratory analysis of b iomarkers in plasma associated 
with VE -PTP inhibition and Tie2 activation.  Once results of the study are known, the Sponsor 
will determine the value of conducting the genetic and biomarker assessments.  
Subjects will be seen at the investigative site ever y 4 weeks while participating in the study.  At 
each monthly visit, subjects will undergo blood pressure and heart rate monitoring and visual acuity assessments. Subjects will also be questioned about any symptoms since their prior visit, and any adverse events and changes or additions to concomitant medications will be documented. Subjects will undergo blood sampling for clinical laboratory assessments (monthly for chemistry and every other month for hematology assessments). Fecal occult blood will be evaluated at  Screening , Month 6, Month 9, and Month 12 (EOT). Subjects will collect their stool 
specimens at home and ship directly to the central clinical laboratory for testing; Investigative 
sites will distribute instructions and supplies for specimen collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Every three 
months, subjects will also undergo a battery of comprehensive ocular assessments at the investigative site including slit lamp biomicroscopy, IOP, dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy, SD-
OCT, fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (at Months 6 and 12 only). Exploratory efficacy assessments (OCT -A, UWF imaging and non-invasive ERG) will also be included at a 
subset of sites.    
In addition to the assessments at the study site visits, at Screening and every three months during 
the treatment period , subjects will be visited at their homes by a home healthcare nurse, who will 
conduct body system assessments  and review status of specimen collection f or fecal occult blood 
testing (on relevant visits) . The home health care nurse will also conduct the [ADDRESS_498866]. The home healthcare nurse visits are 
anticipa ted to provide an additional measure of safety oversight.

 9.2.1 Clinical Evaluations  
The following clinical evaluations will be conducted during the course of the study.   
• Medical /ophthalmic  history and demographics :  Relevant medical history (with particular 
emphasis on previous medical conditions that may lead to exclusion) and significant 
ongoing medical conditions or diseases should be documented. Ophthalmic history should include treatment history for DR/DME. 
• Body System Assessments:  Body systems to be evaluated include general appearance, 
HEENT (head, ears, eyes, nose and throat), cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdomen/gastrointestinal (including query of any changes in bowel habit frequency, consistency, or color), musculoskeletal, and skin (including query of any skin abnormalities noted as well as direct observation of skin of head, neck, chest, abdomen, back and extremities) . Subjects will be instructed that if they note any abnormalities 
between visits they should contact [CONTACT_396578] .  
• Height  (at Screening  only), weight , and temperature  
• 12-Lead ECG :  A standard 12- lead ECG will be obtained after the subject has been 
resting comfortably in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_73414] [ADDRESS_498902] be recorded with a paper speed of 
25 mm/sec and printed as a paper copy.   The Investigator (or a qualified observer) will 
interpret the ECG and record the results including the following parameters: heart rate, PR interval, QT interval, QRS interval, and QTcF (corrected). 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal E CGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads are placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a machine -
read QTcF value is prolonged, repeat measuremen ts may not be necessary if a qualified 
physician’s interpretation determines that the QTcF values are in the acceptable range.  
All abnormal rhythms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_396579].  The Inve stigator should utilize medical judgment 
in the reporting of AEs and SAEs as well as determination of additional cardiac work-up.  A printed record of the tracing(s) of the clinically significant rhythm(s) will be made and retained with other source documents. An ECG will be performed at the Screening, Month 6, and Month 12 (EOT) visits. 
• Vital Signs: Vital signs include blood pressure and heart rate.  Vital sign assessments 
should be taken prior to blood draws when possible. The subject should be seated, with legs uncrossed and feet resting comfortably on the floor, for at least 5 minutes prior to measuring blood pressure and heart rate. 
• ETDRS Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA):   Visual acuity of both eyes will be 
assessed using the ETDRS protocol at 4 me ters.   
• Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy:  Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will include examination of the 
cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris/pupil, lens, and eyelid of both eyes.  Findings

 will be graded as normal, abnormal  not clinical ly significant, or abnormal clinically 
significant.     
• Intraocular Pressure (IOP):  IOP will be assessed with either applanation tonometry or 
tonopen; the method should be consistent throughout the study. 
• Dilated Indirect Ophthalmoscopy: Dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy will be performed to 
assess the vitreous, macula, optic nerve, and peripheral retina of both eyes.  Findings will 
be graded as normal, abnormal not clinical ly significant, or abnormal clinically 
significant.     
• SD OCT : Spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD OCT ) will be utilized to 
assess retinal  characteristics of both eyes. The OCT instrument type used throughout the 
study must be consistent for an individual subject. OCT imaging data will be transmitted to a central reading center for independent analysis. De tailed instructions for imaging and 
data transfers will be provided in the study- specific imaging manual. 
• Fundus Photography : Modified 7-Field or 4- Wide Field color fundus photographs 
(including red free images) of both eyes will be taken to evaluate retinal anatomy.  Photographs will be transferred to a central reading center.  Detailed instructions for imaging and data transfers will be provided in the study- specific imaging manual.  
o For sites participating in the UWF imaging sub -study, in  addition  to Modified 7-
Field or 4- Wide Field color fundus photographs, UWF color fundus photographs 
should be taken using the Optos P200Tx or Optos [LOCATION_004] system. Parameters 
obtained are detailed further in this section under “UWF imaging”.  
• Fluorescein Angiograph y (FA) : Retinal vasculature of both eyes will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_228628] (FA).  FA images will be transferred to a central reading center.  Detailed instructions for imaging and data transfers will be provided in the study -specific 
imaging  manual . 
o For sites participating in the UWF imaging sub -study, in  lieu of standard FA, 
UWF FA images should be taken using the Optos P200Tx or Optos [LOCATION_004] 
system. Parameters obtained are detailed further in this section under “UWF 
Imaging”.  
• Adverse Event Assessments:  Beginning with informed consent and through final 
protocol required  visit, the Investigator and study personnel will review each subject’s 
laboratory and clinical evaluation findings and query the subject directly regarding AEs (see Section 
10).  If a home healthcare nurse identifies any potential AEs during a home 
visit, the nurse will communicate directly to the study site and the Investigator will be responsible for determination of AEs and any necessary follow-up with the subject. Subjects must be followed for AEs until the final required protocol visit or until all drug-related toxicities and serious adverse events have resolved (or  are considered 
chronic/stable), whichever is later.   
• Concomitant Medication Recording:  All medications, both prescription and non-
prescription, and including vitamins, herbals, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8593], inhaled, and intranasal, taken within 30 days prior to the start of study medication and through the Month 12 EOT visit

Page [ADDRESS_498903] started or discontinued any medication since their previous study visit.  This includes single use or PRN (as needed) medication use.  All medications and treatments, including vitamin supplements, over-the-counter medications, and oral herbal preparations must be recorded in the CRFs.   
• Exploratory Efficacy Sub-Study Evaluations (to be conducted at a subset of sites):  
o OCT -A – OCT -angiography should be obtained from both eyes using a SD OCT  
machine according to instructions provided by [CONTACT_3455]  
o ERG – Flicker ERGs will be obtained from both eyes using the RETeval system 
(LKC Technologies, Gait hersburg MD). Responses will be obtained from 
electrodes placed on the skin under light- adapted conditions. Parameters obtained 
will include flicker ERG amplitude, ERG peak latency, and pupi[INVESTIGATOR_396541] 3 different flicker intensities . RETeval  score will also be derived from 
these data (Maa et al, 2015).   
o UWF imaging  – UWF FA and UWF color fundus photographs will be obtained 
using the Optos P200Tx or Optos [LOCATION_004] instrument following procedures specified in the study specific imaging manual.  As described previously, UWF 
FA will be performed in  lieu of standard FA, but UWF photographs will be 
obtained in  addition  to standard Modified 7-Field or 4- Wide Field  color fundus 
photographs. UWF fundus photographs are only obtained on visits when UWF 
FA is performed (e.g. Screening, Month 6, and Month 12 (EOT). Parameters 
obtained from UWF FA include area of peripheral non-perfusion, area of peripheral leakage. Parameters measured in UWF color fundus photographs 
include peripheral microaneurysms, vitreous hemorrhage, venous beading, intra -
retinal microvascular abnormalities ( IRMA ) and neovascularization elsewhere 
(NVE) .  
9.2.2 Laboratory Evaluations :  
All samples collected (with the exception of urine pregnancy tests) will be sent to a central 
clinical labor atory.   
If to be conducted at the same time points, blood sampling should occur after vital sign assessments and ECGs have been conducted.  
Samples for clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, fecal occult blood testing, 
and urinalysis assays) and Screening serum pregnancy tests will be analyzed at the central 
laboratory.  The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory results for clinical significance.  
The central laboratory is also responsible for distribution of PK samples t o the respective PK 
laboratory for analysis.  Once the results of the study are known, the Sponsor will determine if biomarker and genetic analyses will be conducted and will direct the central clinical laboratory 
on distribution of samples for biomarker and genetic analyses to the appropriate laboratories .

10 ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1  Adverse Events (AEs) 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or trial subject 
administered a drug or biologic (medicinal product) or using a medical device; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage.  
AEs include the following: 
• All suspected adverse medication reactions. 
• All reactions from medication overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity.  
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a preexisting illness (see paragraph below on Preexisting Conditions). 
• Injury or accidents.  Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury 
or accident (e.g., a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness), the 
accident (e.g., fall secondary to dizziness), and any adverse outcome (e.g., hip fracture secondary to the fall) should be reported as three separate adverse events.   
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] 
test).  
• Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation 
(beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are associated with an already 
reported clinical event.  Laboratory abnormalities associated with a clinical event (e.g., elevated liver enzymes in a subj ect with jaundice) should be described under Comments 
on the report of the clinical event (e.g., jaundice) rather than listed as a separate adverse event.  
Procedures  – Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, 
should not be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event and the resulting appendectomy noted under Comments.

Page 55 of 72 
 Preexisting Conditions  – In this trial, a preexisting condition (i.e., a disorder present before the 
adverse event reporting period) should not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_245926].  
Abnormal Test Findings – All laboratory test results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737].  The 
Investigator will utilize his/her judgment in determining if out of range laboratory values are 
clinically significant and should denote this using the abbreviation “CS” on the laboratory report 
for source documentation.  Laboratory tests that are labeled as clinically significant should be reported as AEs, either separately or as part of a description of a symptomatic AE.  If there are significant changes in a laboratory report from a previous visit that are determined to be clinically significant, these should also be reported as AEs.  Any abnormal laboratory value which requires treatment or further diagnostic testing and/or results in discontinuation from study 
should be reported as AEs. 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Each adverse event is to be classified by [CONTACT_28135].  An adverse event  that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as serious: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (see paragraph below on Life- threatening)  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (see 
parag raph below on Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (see paragraph below on Disability)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important adverse events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
The term serious also includes any other event that the Investigator or Sponsor judges to be 
serious or which is defined as serious by [CONTACT_396583].  If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an AE or SAE, the information is to  be treated as an SAE.  
Life-threatening – Any AE that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred.  A life-threatening event does not include an event that might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death as it actually occurred.  For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening, even though drug- induced hepatitis of a more severe 
natur e can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] – Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225938] a 
minimum of 24 hours.  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g., elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a

 total knee replacement due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not 
worsened during the course of the study). 
Disability  – Defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
10.1.3  Severity 
The Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the 
maximum intensity of the adverse event.  For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows: 
MILD:  Does not interfere with subject's usual function  
MODERATE:  Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function  
SEVERE:   Interferes significantly with subject's usual function  
Note the distinction between the gravity and the intensity of an adverse event.  Severe is a measure of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious  reaction.  For example, a 
headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious events listed above. 
10.[ADDRESS_498916] event that occurs subsequent to the AE reporting period 
that the Investigator assesses as possibly or probably related to the study medication should also be reported as an AE.  
10.3.2  Reporting AEs  
NONSERIOUS AEs are to be reported on the adverse event case report forms.

Amendment #5 Integrated    
 
 
Aerpio  — Company Confidential  
Page 57 of 72 
 10.3.3  Reporting SAEs  
Serious adverse events should be reported on both the clinical trial adverse event CRF and 
the Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
Note:   Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  
For example, the same AE term s hould be used on both forms. 
Any SAE, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
after the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE by [CONTACT_396584].  Compliance with this time requirement is  essential so that the Sponsor may comply with its 
regulatory obligations. 
The initial SAE report should be completed as fully as possible but should contain, at a minimum:  
• A description of the event and the reason why the event is categorized as serious 
• Subject identification number 
• Investigator’s name [CONTACT_396592] 
• Name [CONTACT_225983] (not applicable for double-masked studies) 
• Causality assessment  
Follow-Up information relating to an SAE must be reported to the clinica l safety contact [CONTACT_391797] [ADDRESS_498917] should be observed and monitored carefully until the condition resolves or stabilizes. 
All deaths are t o be thoroughly investigated and reported.  Autopsy reports are to be obtained, if 
possible. The Sponsor and/or its designee are responsible for reporting SAEs to all applicable regulatory 
agencies and the central ethics committees within the required timeline.  
The Investigator is responsible for submitting required safety information to their local I RB. This 
information includes but is not limited to any safety alert letter received from the Sponsor and any SAEs occurring at their site.  
10.3.4  Relationship to Study Medication  
The causal relationship of the AE to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_29548].  The following definitions will be used in assessment. 
Probably Related :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration.  It follows a known response pattern to the study drug.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs. 
Possibly Related :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.

Page 58 of 72 
 Unrelated :  The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
product or the AE is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, other 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the subject. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_498918]’s participation in the trial ends (i.e., until a final report is completed for that subject).  
In addition, all serious adverse events and those nonserious events assessed by [CONTACT_391799]'s participation in the trial is over.  Such events should be followed until they resolve or unt il the Investigator assesses them as “chronic” or “stable.”

the pregnancy and will follo w the neonate up to 1 month of birth. 
Within 24 hours of awareness, Investigator sites will notify the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or CRO designee of abnormal pregnancy outcomes.  Normal outcomes may be reported within 5 
days of awareness .  Reporting of outcome will be provided on the Pregnancy Reporting Form. 
In addition to reporting the outcome on the Pregnancy Reporting Form, if the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth , neonatal death within one month of birth, or congenital anomaly [including that in an 
aborted fetus]), the Investigator should also follow the procedures for reporting a SAE within 24 hours of awareness.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes follows: 
• Note that “spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
• All neonatal deaths that occur within one month of birth should be reported, without 
regard to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after one month that the 
Investigator assesses as possibly or probably related to the in utero exposure to the study 
medication should also be reported. 
• In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at time of birth.

necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source documents are contained in the subject’s chart at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_225945]'s office.  In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  
12.[ADDRESS_498934] Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed Informed Consent Forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE forms, source documents, detailed records of drug disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant corr espondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone 
calls reports).  The records should be retained by [CONTACT_391803] (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever time period is longer. 
If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (e.g., retirement, relocation), the Sponsor should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to the Sponsor, such as another Investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.  The Investigator must obtain Sponsor’s written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.

require deviation from protocol-specified procedures, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor or designee (and IRB, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. 
The site should document all protocol deviations in the subject’s source documents.  In the event 
of a significant deviation, the site should notify the Sponsor or its designee (and IRB, as required) immediately.  Significant deviations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study assessments.  
14 TRIAL DISCONTINUATION/INVESTIGAT IVE SITE TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects, but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons.  After such a decision, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_27936] a time period specified by [CONTACT_391807].   
The study may also be put on hold or discontinued by [CONTACT_396588]. 
14.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study 
The following criteria may result in either temporary suspension or early termination of the 
study:  
• New information regarding the safety or efficacy of the study medication that indicates a change i n the known risk/benefit profile for the compound, such that the risk/benefit is no 
longer acceptable for subjects participating in the study.  
• Significant violation of GCP that compromises the ability to achieve the primary study 
objectives or compromises subject safety.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial for other valid administrative reasons. 
14.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Investigational Sites 
A study site may be terminated prematurely or suspended if the site (including the Investigator) 
is found to be in significant violation of GCP, protocol, contractual agreement, or is unable to ensure adequate performance of the study or guarantee safety of participating subjects.  
14.3 Procedures for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study or 
Investigational Site(s)  
In the event that the Sponsor elects to terminate or suspend the study or the participation of an 
Investigational site, a study -specific procedure for early termination or suspension will be 
provided by [CONTACT_1034]; the procedure will be followed by [CONTACT_391808].

Page 71 of 72 18.2  Appendix B: Criteria for Treatment of PDR or DME in the Study Eye or 
Qualified Fellow Eye During the Study 
Standardizing the criteria to treat PDR or DME during this study will allow for enhanced 
evaluation of the effect of AKB-[ADDRESS_498948] 
been adapted from the DRCR.net Protocol W (http://drcrnet.jaeb.org/Studies.aspx?RecID=340 ).  
If a study eye or qualified fellow eye treated for PDR or DME, study medication may be 
discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator and subject . If a non-qualified fellow eye 
requires treatment for PDR or DME, the subject will remain in the study.  
o Criteria for treatment of PDR or DME in the study eye or qualified fellow eye and 
allowed treatments are presented below. Non- qualified  fellow eyes may be treated 
at the discretion of the Investigator.  
o Refer to Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_498949] 
one of the following is present: 
1. Neovascularization of the angle or neovascular glaucoma  
2. Neovascularization of the disc (NVD) greater than standard photograph 10A (1/4 to 1/3 disc area)  
3. Any NVD with pre-retinal or vitreous hemorrhage  
4. Neovascularization elsewhere ( NVE ) greater than ½ disc area with pre-retinal or vitreous 
hemorrhage 
5. Vitreous hemorrhage (VH) requiring treatment that is presumed to be from PDR  
6. If none of the above is met, Reading Center confirmation of neovascularization within the 
7-field fundus photo area should be obtained prior to initiating treatment whenever possible 
Treatment of neovascularization outside of the 7-field fundus photo area without the presence of pre-retinal or vitreous hemorrhage is discouraged ( If the 
Investigator believes treatment for peripheral neovascularization is necessary, the 
sponsor should be informed prior to initiation).  
Treatment for PDR can include:  
1. Anti-VEGF IVT  
2. PRP / sector Laser photocoagulation 
3. Vitrectomy  
 Treatment for DME in the study eye or qualified fellow eye should not be given unless t here is 
center -involved DME on clinical exam with ≥ 10% increase in CST from baseline and : 
1. ≥ 10 letter loss of BC VA at a single visit or 
2. 5 to 9 letter loss of BC VA at 2 consecutive visits

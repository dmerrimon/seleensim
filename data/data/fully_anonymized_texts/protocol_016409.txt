 20 1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE   
 
Psoriasis is a chronic, disfiguring,  immune -mediated skin disease, with  recent estimates 
of the global prevalence in adults rang ing from 0.51% to 11.43%.[ADDRESS_50500] ing approximately 80% to 85% of psoriasis patients , and 
appears as  sharply demarcated, red  lesions  of variable size usually covered with 
silver/white scales .  Lesions are  typi[INVESTIGATOR_47728]. The s everity of plaque 
psoriasis is moderate- to-severe in an estimated 18% of patients in the U.S.  sufferi ng from 
plaque psoriasis.[ADDRESS_50501] greatly enhanced the  treatment options of 
subjects with moderate- to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for 
phototherapy or systemic therapy.  Currently approved biolog ics  include tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) antagonist agents, i.e.,  etanercept (Enbrel®), infliximab (Remicade®), and 
adalimumab (Humira®), the interleukin [IL] -[ADDRESS_50502] ustekinumab 
(Stelara®), IL-[ADDRESS_50503] agents, i.e., secukinumab (Cosentyx®), brodalumab (Siliq®) 
ixekizumab (Taltz®), and IL -23 antagonists guselkumab (Tremfya®) and tildrakizumab 
(Ilumya®). 
The physical effects of psoriasis are accompanied by a significant and potentially lasting 
impact on the emot ional and psychosocial well -being of patient s, and may lead to 
substantial burden in terms of disability or psychosocial stigmatization.3,4  Significant  loss 
of productivity and adverse effects on mental well -being  result in negative effects not only 
on individuals but also on society.5,6  A recent systematic literature review revealed that 
psoriasis patients suffer from the same deterioration in health- related quality of life as 
patients with other major medical diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular 
diseases .7   
Tildrakizumab , a humanized monoclonal antibody which selectively binds to the p19 
subunit of IL -23, was recently approved in the U.S. for patients with moderate- to-severe 
plaque psoriasis.

 21 “Quality of life” refers to the general well -being of individuals and their ability to enjoy 
normal life activities, encompassing satisfaction with physical and psychological health, 
social and sexual relationships, and employment.  It is important to assess patient -
reported quality of life outcomes in addition to physician- assessed physical parameters 
to truly characterize and assess the burden of  psoriasis and response to treatment from 
the patient’s point of view.  This study  seeks to assess the longer -term impact of 
tildrakizumab on improvements in HRQoL using multiple assessment scales,  as well as 
assessment of psoriasis symptom control and long- term efficacy and safety, under real 
world conditions . 
Detailed information regarding the safety and tolerability of tildrakizumab can be found in the Investigator's Brochure and package labeling.  
 
2. OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective is to demonstrate improvement from baseline in patient quality of 
life (QOL) after 28 and 52 weeks of treatment with tildrakizumab, under real world 
conditions,  as measured by [CONTACT_47737] -Being scale (PGWB).  
Secondary objectives include assessment of patient quality of life  as measured by [CONTACT_47738] (DLQI) , work productivity and activity impairment, 
psoriasis symptom control, patient satisfaction, long -term efficacy and safety .   
3. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_50504] is ineligible to enter the study if he/she meets one or more of the following 
criteria:  
1. Subject is pregnant, lactating, or is planning to become pregnant during the study.  
2. Subject is younger than [ADDRESS_50505](s). A subject must be discontinued from study medication if ei ther of the 
following occur : 
• A serious adverse event, drug reaction or complication, or an unacceptable adverse event  whether attributed to study medication or 
not, that precludes continuation of treatment with study medication. This includes 
the development of allergic reactions or the development of other potentially 
serious  drug reactions to medication required by [CONTACT_760].  
 
• Pregnancy: A subject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue study medication immediat ely. 
In the event that a subject will not receive subsequent treatment (ie, due to safety 
concerns or refusal),  subject will be encouraged to participate in follow -up visits so that 
safety responses can be monitored.   However,  subject may withdraw from th e study  at

 40 8.7. Psychological General Well -Being Index (PGWB)  
The PGWB is a self -administered validated psychometric instrument that measures a 
person's emotional well -being.12 It is specifically designed to be suitable for assessing 
psychological well being in the general medical population as opposed to a psychiatric 
population. The 22 questions of the PGWB   
is graded on a Likert scale, which is commonly used in psychometric questionnaires where the answers range from strongly agree to strongly disagree with gradations in between. Total scores range from 0 to 110, with higher scores indicating better 
psychological well being. This instrument has been validated and used in many countries on large samples of the general population and on various subsets of medical patients.   
 
8.8. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
The DLQI is a self -administered and user -friendly validated questionnaire used to 
measure the health- related quality of life of adult patients suffering from a skin disease.13 
It consists of  questions concerning patients’ perception of the impact of skin diseases on different aspects of their health related quality of life over the last week. It has been validated for adult dermatology patients aged 16 years and older.   
  
 
 
  
  
 higher scores mean 
greater impairment of patient’s QoL.    
 
8.9. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale  (WP
 AI-PSO ) 
The WPAI is a validated, subject- reported quantitative assessment of the amount of 
absenteeism, presenteeism and daily activity impairment attributable to general health or a specific health problem.
14 The WPAI has been validated to specifically quantify work 
impairments for numerous diseases and the WPAI:PSO was created specifically for 
administering to patients with psoriasis.[ADDRESS_50510] a minimum sensitivity of 
25mIU of β -hCG/mL of urine.   Please see Schedule of Study Events for all subsequent 
UPTs.  The investigator will report the UPT results on the CRFs, in the subject’s medical 
records and in any independent records maintained at the study site. Subjects with a  
positive pregnancy test at Visit [ADDRESS_50511] article  will not be allowed 
to enter the study (screen failure).  Subjects with a positive pregnancy  test any time after 
the first dose of test article  will not receive further test art icle; however subjects should 
continue with non- treatment follow -up visits.  All pregnancies should be immediately 
reported to the medical monitor and followed through to resolution (i.e., delivery, 
miscarriage, or abortion).  The report should be submitted within the 24 hours of knowledge.  
9.2. Laboratory Safety Tests  
Laboratory tests for hematology, blood chemistry, and virology/HIV   
Blood samples for laboratory  tests are to be taken prior to first administration of test 
article  and should be performed according to standard laboratory procedures.  Followup 
labs for chemistry, blood count and virology beyond screening can be  done at the clinical 
judgment of the investigator.

If a subject is a screen failure at  Visit 1, complete the Screen Failure CRF.  
11. SAFETY  
11.1.  Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event ( AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or  not considered drug related.  An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the drug without any judgment of causality.  
Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study and a medical history should be taken at screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any changes in the health of subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unless an event occurred as a result of a study -related procedure and is unanticipated; where in such cases, the event 
should be recorded as an adverse event and reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as an “una nticipated problem” in accordance with local procedures. Other changes 
in subject health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the test article and therefore AE data should be collected from the date of the first dose of test arti cle. These data are considered treatment -emergent AEs.  
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the Sponsor  in identifying any untoward 
medical occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]:  
1) protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3) recognition of dose- related test article toxicity;  
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  Tildrakizumab- asmn 
Edition 1.3  
 
SUN Pharmaceuticals Global FZE   CONFIDENTIAL  
 45 4) appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.  
AEs may be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination 
of a subject. The investigator will instruct the subject to report any adverse events that may occur during the study. At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non-directive fashion, about any change in the subject’s overall condition since the previous visit. If known, the investigator should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or 
disorder, rather than its individual symptoms.  
All AEs  must be completely recorded on the AE CRF and include the following:  
• Date of onset  
• Location of the event – specify whether within affected region  
• The Severity  of the event. Record the maximum intensity taking into account the 
possible range of the intensity of the event, using the following definitions:  
  
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  Tildrakizumab- asmn 
Edition 1.[ADDRESS_50512]’s normal functioning; remedial therapy may have been given.  
Moderate  The adverse event was sufficiently intense to produce some impairment of functioning; 
remedial therapy may have been given.  
Severe  The adverse event produced a significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation; therapy was needed.  
 
• Categorize the Relat ionship to Study Treatment  of the AE, as defined below:  
RELATIONSHIP  
Not  
Related:  Concomitant illness, caused by [CONTACT_47745], procedure, accident or event with 
no reasonable association with treatment.  
Unlikely : An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal association sequence from 
administration of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects.  
Possibly: An event that  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test article; follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article;  
but may  have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_47746], or by [CONTACT_22714] . 
Probably : An event that  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
test article ; follows a known or expected response pattern to the test  article; is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_47732]; cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612] ’s clinical state  
or other drugs, procedures or other causes . 
Definite: An event that  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
test article ; follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article ; is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_47732],  and 
reappearance of the event  on repeat exposure (rechallenge) . 
 
• Determine the Action Taken with Study Treatment  due to the AE using the 
definitions below:  
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  Tildrakizumab- asmn 
Edition 1.[ADDRESS_50513] article, or 
those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the study should receive follow -up as appropriate. If possible, report the outcome of any AE that 
caused permanent discontinuation or that was present at the end of the study particularly if the AE is considered by [CONTACT_47747] -related (i.e., definitely, probably, 
or possibly related to test article).  
 
• Determine if the event is considered Serious  based on the definitions in Section 
11.2. 
• Record whether the event caused Study Discontinuation.  
 
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. For the purposes of prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur 
as part of its pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
poss ibility that the drug caused the event.  
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

Edition 1.3  
 
SUN Pharmaceuticals Global FZE   CONFIDENTIAL  
 49 11.2.  Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
An assessment of the seriousness and c ausality of the event will be made by  [CONTACT_1275] , the medical monitor  and the Sponsor’s pharmacovigilance (PV) department .  
The investigator  is to complete a special form provided by [CONTACT_47748] a 
SAE; expeditious handling is required to comply with regulatory requirements .  SAEs will 
also be recorded on the AE CRF.    
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence which  at any dose  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (s) that may not be immediately life- threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical judgement,  
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also be considered serious.   
Events NOT considered to be serious adverse events are:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28217], which was elective or pre- planned, of a pre-
existing condition that did not worsen, and  
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not f ulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
 
The investigator should take appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures to minimize the risk to the subject.  Where appropriate, the investigator should take diagnostic measures to collect evidence for clarification of the relationship between the SAE and the investigational product.  
Adverse events classified as “serious” by [CONTACT_47749]. All serious AEs, whether related or unrelated to test article, must be 
immedi ately reported no later than 24 hours of receipt by [CONTACT_47750] , the Sponsor’s PV department via email  
and, in the event that the Medical Monitor  is unavailable, to the Project Manager 
listed on the first p age of the protocol. Written notification of all SAEs should be sent 

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  Tildrakizumab- asmn 
Edition 1.3  
 
SUN Pharmaceuticals Global FZE   CONFIDENTIAL  
 50 to the Medical Monitor/Project Manager and the Sponsor’s PV department by [CONTACT_47751]. These include those SAEs listed in the protocol or 
investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Should the 
investigator become aware of a SAE (regardless of  its relationship to test article) that 
occurs within [ADDRESS_50514] be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to the Sponsor , if available.  
As required, the Sponsor will notify participating investigators of all suspected adverse 
reactions that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an IND safety report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” according to the criteria listed in 21 CFR Section 312.32. These are:  
i) Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions,  
ii) Findings from other studies including epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled analyses or other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the test articles,  
iii) Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the test articles, or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure, and  
iv) Clinically important increases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected 
adverse reactions.  
Upon receiving such notices,  the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates by [CONTACT_428].   
 
The IRB may require the investigator to report serious adverse events that are possibly 
related to the study drug or all serious adverse events regardless of relatedness. The IRB requirements should be reviewed carefully. The investigator is responsible to notify the 
IRB of specific adverse event information as specified in the IRB approval.  
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  Tildrakizumab- asmn 
Edition 1.[ADDRESS_50515] 
review the following information about study participation for women:  
o Informed consent requirements  
o Contraceptives in current use  
o Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
o Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy in this clinical study . 
All female subjects of child -bearing potential must agree to use a highly  effective form of 
birth control (See Section 4) during the course of the study in a manner such that risk of 
failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, all female subjects of child -bearing 
potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study  
participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. Following 
review of this information and appropriate subject  counseling, the investigator or designee 
and the subject must sign the informed consent.   
If pregnancy is confirmed during screening, the subject must not receive test article  and 
must not be enrolled in the study. All females of childbearing potential enrolling into the study must have pregnancy testing prior to each administration of test art icle. The test 
article administration  must be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known.  
During the study, all female subjects should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_28265] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive further study therapy; 
however every effort should be made to retain the subject in the study  and complete all 
follow -up visits.  At a minimum, the subject must be followed for safety. 
The Investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor and IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study therapy, maintain careful source documentation and record the event on the appropriate CRF  and pregnancy surveillance form .  Protocol -required 
procedures  (except for administration of test article) for pregnant  subjects must be 
performed on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x -ray studies).  Other 
appropriate follow -up procedures including counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_47752], if appropriate.  In addition, the Investigator must report any follow -up information to the Medical Monitor and the IRB regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome on the pregnancy surveillance form provided.  Although pregnancy itself is not an adverse event, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs (or SAEs – if they fulfill the 
SAE criteria). Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic or spontaneous should be reported as a SAE. Infants should be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks or as required by [CONTACT_47753], whichever is longer.   Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  Tildrakizumab- asmn 
Edition 1.[ADDRESS_50516] article should be recorded as a SAE and details 
documented on the pregnancy surveillance form.  
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1.  General Considerations for Data Analysis  
The methodology presented below is a summary of the more detailed analysis plan that will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized before the database is locked.  Any changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified in the clinical study report.  
It is planned that the data from both centers that participate in this protocol will be combined so that an adequate number of subjects will be available for analysis.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS statistical software.  
12.2.  Sample Size Determination  
No formal sample size calculations were performed.  The sample size of [ADDRESS_50517] one dose of the study medication.  
   
12.4.  Statistical Methods  
All population characteristics and parameters will be described using summary statistics.  Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated for each continuous variable.  Estimates of the efficacy 
endpoints of interest will be calculated with  wherever 
possible.

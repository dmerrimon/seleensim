and tolerabilit y of xentuzumab and abemaciclib in patients with 
locally  advanced or metastatic solid tumours and in combination 
with endocrine therap y in patients with locally  advanced or 
metastatic hormone receptor -positive, HER2 -, breast cancer, 
followed b y expansion cohorts.
Lay Ti tle:This study  in patients with different t ypes of cancer (solid 
tumours) aims to find a safe dose of xentuzumab in combination 
with abemaciclib with or without hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The study  
also tests how effective these medicines are in patients with lung 
and breast cancer.

Objective(s): Dose finding cohorts A, B, C and D:
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended 
phase II dose (RP2D) of xentuzumab in combination with 
abemaciclib with or without hormonal therapy  (letrozole, anastrozole, 
fulvestrant).
Expansion cohorts E, F , D1 and D2:
To assess the 
anti-tumour activity  of xentuzumab in combination with 
abemaciclib in patients with non -small cell lung cancer (cohort E), to 
assess the anti -tumour activity  of the triplet combination xentuzumab, 
abemaciclib and fulvestrant in patients with locally  advanced/
metastatic, HR+ breast cancer who have progressed following prior 
aromatase inhibitor therapy  and prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment 
(cohort F ),and to assess anti-tumor activity of the triplet combination 
xentuzumab , abemaciclib and fulvestrant in patients with locally 
advanced/metastatic HR+ breast cancer visceral disease (Cohort D1) 
or non-visceral disease (Cohort D2) who have progressed following 
endocrine therap y.
Exploratory Objective:
To expand the understanding of the study  drug and the disease 
explorative biomarkers will be measured and analy sed. These 
analyses are h ypothesis generating.

For dose finding cohorts, inter -patient dose (de -)escalation is guided 
by a Bay esian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) with overdose 
control that will be fitted to binary  toxicity  outcomes. The estimate 
of parameters will be updated as data are accumulated using the 
BLRM. At the end of each dose finding, the toxicity  probabilit y at

d FU: All patients should have a follow -up visit 42 days (+7day s) after the permanent discontinu ation of the study  
drugs
1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any protocol specific screening assessment is performed 
2. In/Exclusion criteria must be checked at screening and ensured before study medication has been firstly administered.
3. Physic al exam: includes a thorough cardiopulmonary, abdominal and lymph node exam and an assessment of the mental 
and neurological status
4. Vital signs: includes respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse, temperature and blood pressure
5. 12-lead ECG: 12-Lead resting electrocardiogram s (ECG) are recorded locally and in triplicate. ECG will be performed 
at Screening, EOTV and FU visit.  ECG will be repeated at Visit 1/Day 1, and Visit 3/Day 15 of Course 1, 2, 3; and at 
Visit 1/Day 1 of Courses 6,9,12, etc. ECG should be performed prior to xentuzumab infusion.
6. Safety labs: includes haematology (CBC), coagulation, negative serum pregnancy test for women with childbearing 
potential and biochemistry . Urinalysis only at screening and EOTV . Fasting blood test is required for metabolic panels.
See Section 5.3.[ADDRESS_934008]. Unscheduled safety lab 
should be performed if clinically indicated and documented in the eCRF
7. For course 2 only
8. Archival tumour tissue collection: the most recent/appropriate archival tumour tissue must be collected prior to the start 
of trial treatment. Refer to Appendix 10.3 for tissue requirements
9. Blood soluble biomarkers: for detailed sampling time schedule, refer to Section 5.5 and Appendix 10.2.1
10. Pharmacokinetics: Course 1, Course 2 -12, 15, 18, EOTV and FU visits. For detailed PK sampling time schedule, refer to 
Section 5.4.1 and Appendix 10.2.1 for cohorts A, B, C and D
11. Pharmacogenomics and cfDNA. See Section 5.5 for more details on collection time points. Briefly, o ne blood sample to 
isolate genomic D NA will be obtained at C1V1 before treatment. 3 plasma samples will be collected to isolate circulating 
nucleic acids (e.g. cfDNA) from plasma: at C1V1 before treatment, at C3V1 and at the EOTV . 
12. For course 3 only
13. PGx Plasma: blood samples will be collecte d before treatment on C1V1, C1V3 (Day 15), C2V1, C3V1 and beyond, and 
at the EOTV. Samples will be used to evaluate exosomal RNA.
14. DNA banking: For details please refer to Section 5.5.1 .
15. Immunogenicity (ADA): On days when xentuzum abis dosed and EOTV and FU visit at time points specified in Flow 
Chart and Appendix 10.2.[ADDRESS_934009], abdomen and pelvis, and, if clinically indicated, any
other known or suspected sites of disease (e.g. breast, neck, brain etc.) accordingly to RECIST 1.1. After study entry, all 
lesions identified as target and non -target lesions during the screening should be followed up at all pre -specified imaging 
time points. The same radiographic procedure must be used throughout the study. Bone scans must be performed at 
screening (see Section 5.2 for more detail). 
Assessment will be performed at the following time points until progression/start of further treatment (tumour assessments 
after start of xentuzumab should be performed no more than 7 days prior to the scheduled tumour assessment date up to 
week 48 AND no more than 14 days prior to the scheduled tumour assessment date after week 48):
 At screening (within 28 days prior to starting of treatment)
 Every 8 weeks (±7days) : during week 8 ( 49-
63days after start of xentuzumab ), during week 16 ([ADDRESS_934010] art of xentuzumab ), during week 24 ( 161-1 75days after start of xentuzumab ), during week 32 (217-2 31
days after start of xentuzumab ), during week 40 (273-28 7days after start of xentuzumab ), during week 48 (329-
343days after start of xentuzumab )
 Every 12 weeks after week 48 (±7days) (e.g. during week 60 (406- 434days after start of xentuzumab ), during 
week 72 ( 490-518 days after start of xentuzumab ), etc.)
In the event of an interruption/delay to treatment, the tumour assessment schedule should not be chan ged. 
Except in case of discontinuation from treatment due to progression, tumour assessment at EOTV is not necessary if the 
previous evaluation was done within 4 weeks of EOTV
Unscheduled scan based on the investigator’s judgement is allowed and should al so be documented in eCRF 
17. Abemaciclib and xentuzumab should be dispensed through IRT. Patient’s screening, all drug dispensation visits and 
EOTV will be collected in the IRT system
18. Compliance check: on Day 1 of every course starting on course 2 and at EOTV

Assessment will be performed at the following time points until progression/start of further treatment (tumour assessments 
after start of xentuzumab should be performed no more than 7 days prior to the scheduled tumou r assessment date up to 
week 48 AND no more than 14 days prior to the scheduled tumour assessment date after week 48):
 At screening (within 28 days prior to starting of treatment)
 Every 8 weeks (±7days) : during week 8 ( 49-63days after start of xentuzumab )
, during week 16 (105 -119 days 
after start of xentuzumab ), during week 24 ( 161-1 75days after start of xentuzumab ), during week 32 (217-2 31
days after start of xentuzumab ), during week 40 (273-28 7days after start of xentuzumab ), during week 48 (329-
343 da ys after start of xentuzumab )
 Every 12 weeks after week 48 (±7days) (e.g. during week 60 (406- 434days after start of xentuzumab ), during 
week 72 ( 490-518 days after start of xentuzumab ), etc.)
In the event of an interruption/delay to treatment, the tumour assessment schedule should not be changed. 
Except in case of discontinuation from treatment due to progression, tumour assessment at EOTV is not necessary if the 
previous evaluation was done w ithin 4 weeks of EOTV
Unscheduled scan based on the investigator’s judgement is allowed and should also be documented in eCRF 
17. Abemaciclib, xentuzumab and fulvestrant (in certain countries) should be dispensed through IRT. Patient’s screening, all 
drug dis pensation visits and EOTV will be collected in the IRT system

circulating nucleic acids (e.g. cfDNA) from plasma: at Run-
in V1, atC1V1 before treatment, at C3V1 a ndat the EOTV . 
14. For course 3 only
15. PGx Plasma: Blood samples will be collected before treatment at run-in V1, on C1V1, C1V3 (Day 15), C2V1, C3V1 
onwards and at the EOTV. Samples will be used to evaluate exosomal RNA.
16. DNA banking: For details please refer to Section 5.5.1 .
17. Immunogenicity (ADA): On days when xentuzumab is dosed and EOTV and FU visit at time points specified in Flow 
Chart and Appendix 10.2.[ADDRESS_934041], abdomen and pelvis, and, if clinically indicated, any 
other known or suspected sites of disease (e.g. breast, neck, brain etc.) accordingly to RECIST 1.1. After study entry, all 
lesions identified as target and non -target lesions during the screenin g should be followed up at all prespecified imaging 
time points. The same radiographic procedure must be used throughout the study. Bone scans must be performed at

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Hormone receptor -positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC)
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. In 2012, there were approximately 
226,[ADDRESS_934070] cancer and 39,510 deaths from the disease among women in the 
[LOCATION_002] (Siegel et al. 2012 R12-2864). Wh ile early stage disease is curable, patients with 
metastatic breast cancer (mBC) have a median overall survival (OS) of only 2 to 3 years ( R16-
3983 ). The treatment for women diagnosed with hormone receptor positive (HR+) mBC 
includes endocrine therapy ( R16-3983 ). However, de novo or acquired resistance to endocrine 
therap y remains an important clinical problem. Many HR+ breast cancers demonstrate 
overexpression of cy clin D1 ( R16-3978), which interacts with cy clin-dependent kinases 4 and 
6 (hereafter CDK4/6) in an active protein complex that promotes cell proliferation. 
Consequently , CDK4/6 represents a potential therapeutic target for HR+ breast cancers, and 
CDK4/6 inhibitors need to be evaluated for their potential to improve clinical outcomes for 
women with HR+ mBC.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_103281], hormone -positive HR+ advanced or metastatic breast cancer still has 
a dismal prognosis with median progression- free survival (PFS) of less than a y ear; almost all 
patients will develop resistance to endocrine treatment and succumb to their disease eventually . 
Biochemical and genetic characterization of D -type cy clins, their cy clin D –dependent kinases 
(CDK4 and CDK6), and the polypeptide CDK4/6 inhibitor p16INK4A over two decades ago 
revealed how mammalian cells regulate entry  into the DNA synthetic (S) phase of the cell-
division cycle in a retinoblastoma protein (pRb)
–dependent manner. These investigations 
provided proof -
of-principle that CDK4/[ADDRESS_934071] s, might 
prove valuable in cancer therap y. The recent FDA approval of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib 
(Ibrance™), used with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and fulvestrant for breast cancer 
treatment, highlights long-sought success by [CONTACT_688641]. 
Moreover, the newest findings herald clinical trials targeting other cancers such as non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_688598]4/[ADDRESS_934072] 
validated these cell
-cycle kinases as anticancer drug targets, corroborating longstanding 
preclinical predictions (R16-2249; R16- 3979).
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide as well as the leading cause of cancer 
related deaths in both men and women. Non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for up 
to 85% of all lung cancers and of the se, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
account for 50% and 30% respectivel y. Most of these patients present with locally  advanced 
inoperable or metastatic disease, which makes their cancer incurable, and unfortunatel y almost 
all of these patients will die from their illness. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_688599], 
diagnostic procedures and therapeutic options, the overall outlook has not greatl y changed for 
the majority of patients with the overall [ADDRESS_934073] decade from 15.7% to 17.4% (P15-[ZIP_CODE] ). Smoking remains the major cause of 
NSCL C, although the identification of driver oncogenes in non -smoking patients represents a 
critical novel finding during the last decades that fundamentall y changed the management of

c09049566
-10 Trial Protocol Page 37of 177
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934074]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015this disease. The recognition that NSCLC is not a single disease entity  today  is a well-known 
reality  that has led to divide NSCL C into different sub-types, each one with specific algorithms 
of treatment, based on histological and molecular features (reviewed in P16-[ZIP_CODE] and P15-
[ZIP_CODE] ). 
Thus, the landscape of NSCL C therapi[INVESTIGATOR_688600] y over 
the last few years. The discovery  of oncogenic driver mutations has led to new ways in 
classify ing NSCL C as well as offered novel therapeutic targets for anticancer therap y. Targets 
such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK) gene rearrangements have successfully  been targeted with appropriate tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKI s). Other driver mutations such as ROS, MET, RET, BRAF have also been 
investigated with targeted agents with some success in the early phase clinical setting. Novel 
strategies in the field of immune -oncology  have also led to the development of inhibitors of 
cytotoxic T ly mphocy te antigen -4 (CTLA -4) and programmed death
-1 receptor (PD -1), which 
are important pathway s in allowing cancer cells to escape detecti on by [CONTACT_27639] 
(P15-[ZIP_CODE]).
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_374331], however, there remain man y patients that are refractory to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. nivolumab and pembrolizumab) or chemotherapy  and 
who do not be nefit from targeted agents against activating -mutations in the EGFR gene or 
the ALK translocation, such as afatinib or crizotinib, respectivel y. Clearly, therefore, novel 
agents against additional molecular targets are desperatel y needed. In this regard, the insulin 
growth factor -1 receptor (IGF -1R) is a heterodimeric transmembrane t yrosine kinase receptor 
that is a mediator of cellular proliferation and frequently  overexpressed in NSCL C.
CDK4/6 inhibitors (Abemaciclib)
During the cell cycle, the G1 restriction point controls entry  into S phase and is essential for 
maintaining control of cell division (R16-2249, R16- 3704 ). The cyclin-dependent kinases 
(CDKs), CDK4 and CDK6 (hereafter designated CDK4/6), participate in a complex with D-
type cyclins to initiate the transition through the G1 restriction point by [CONTACT_688642] (Rb) tumour suppressor protein. 
Alterations in this pathway  occur frequentl y in human cance rs, amongst others HR+ BC, 
NSCL C and Pancreatic Cancer , and involve 1) loss of CDK inhibitors by [CONTACT_688643][INVESTIGATOR_263574], 2) mutation/overexpression of either CDK4/6 or cyclin D, or 3) 
inactivation of Rb. These 
alterations render cells less depend ent on mitogenic signalling for 
proliferation. With the possible exception of those tumours with complete inactivation of Rb, 
which functions downstream of the CDK4/6- cyclinD complex , most cancers are potentially  
sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of CD K4/6. All of these cancers are potentially sensitive 
to pharmacologic inhibition of CDK4/6. From a therapeutic standpoint, the goal of inhibiting  
CDK4/6 with a small molecule inhibitor is to prevent cell cycle progression through the G1 
restriction point, thus arresting tumour growth in the cancers investigated in the present trial.
Targeting IGF in cancer ( xentuzumab )
The insulin -like growth factor (IGF) signalling system consists of ligands (insulin -like growth 
factors 1 and 2 (I GF-1, IGF-2), IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), and receptors (IGF -1R, IGF-
2R and insulin receptor IR)). Evidence that targeting IGF may be useful in cancer treatment 
was first recognized decades ago. Research in IGF signalling has shown that it controls key 
cellular activities, including proliferation, growth, and survival and is often deregulated in

cancer cells express insulin and IGF-[ADDRESS_934076], ovarian, liver cancer 
and sarcoma (R12-
4524, P15- [ZIP_CODE] , P15-[ZIP_CODE] ). Therefore, the IGF system is an attractive 
tempting target for anti -cancer drug development. 
Pharmacologic targeting strategies include inhibition of receptor function with anti-receptor 
antibodies or small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (R12-4524 , P15- [ZIP_CODE], P15-
[ZIP_CODE] ). Xentuzumab offers an alternative approach by [CONTACT_52999] a ligand specific antibody . 
Most cancers express IGF-1 receptors, but there is evidence that autocrine and/or paracrine 
expression of ligands, particularly  IGF
-2, is deranged in neoplasm (R10-5355). In addition, the 
IGF-2 gene is an imprinted gene; loss ofimprinting is one of several mechanisms leading to 
IGF-2 overexpression (R10-
5694). Further, IGF -[ADDRESS_934077] insulin -like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF -1/-2) with the 
potential of anti-neoplastic activity . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_688601]-IGF-1R agents, the therapeutic value of targeting the IGF/IGF -1R 
signalling system remains incompletely  tested, given that the development of certain promising 
agents (e.g., figitumumab, ganitumab, dalotuzumab, R1507) has been discontinued in some 
indications. Efficacy  signals generated by [CONTACT_688644].
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
For a more detailed description of the xentuzumab profile and abemaciclib profile please refer 
to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and for letrozole, anastrozole and fulvestrant to the 
SmPC or US PI .
Xentuzumab
Xentuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody  that binds with high affinity  to IGF-1 
and IGF-2, and potently  neutralizes the proliferative and pro-survival cellular signalling 
triggered b y both proteins. Mode of action differentiation to IGF -1 receptor (IGF -1R)targeted 
antibodies was demonstrated, in particular through inhibition of IGF-2 stimulated insulin 
receptor -A (IR-A) activation, an additional proliferative and pro-survival pathway  not inhibited 
by [CONTACT_14799]-1R targeted mAbs.
At the cut-off date of 18 January 2019, a total of about 494 patients were treated in the 
xentuzumab clinical program: Eight y-one (81) patients were treated in two xentuzumab Phase 
I dose-escalation trials, examining a weekl y and a three -weekl y dosing schedule. Dose 
escalation to 1800 mg weekl y or 3600 mg q3w did not identify  a maximum -tolerated dose. A 
relevant biological dose for xentuzumab monotherapy  in solid tumours was determined at 1000 
mg weekl y, used as the recommended dose for further Phase II trials (RP2D).
Moreover, in a phase Ib /  randomized phase II study  of xentuzumab in combination with 
everolimus and exemestane in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone -receptor positive

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934078]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015(HR+) breast cancer (Study  1280.4) , 24 patients were treated in the dose escalation part (Ib) of 
this trial.
The MTD of xentuzumab was 1000 mg/week in combination with exemestane 25 mg/day and 
everolimus 10 mg/day , which was also determined as the RP2D.
Lastl y, a complete dphase I b trial evaluates the safety  and anti- tumour activity of xentuzumab
in combination with afatinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with resistant to 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors. At the time of the data 
cut-off (18 January  2019 ), the safet y profile was as expected for monoth erapy  of afatinib. The
RP2D has been determined at 40 mg/day  afatinib and 1000 mg/week xentuzumab . 
No relevant hypergl ycaemia has been observed so far. Xentuzumab was well tolerated, with 
no relevant side effects reported. The type and pattern of adverse events (AEs) observed to date 
have generally  been of mild to moderate intensity (CTCAE Grades 1 or 
2) or consistent with 
the safet y profile of combination backbone treatment or consistent with the underl ying 
neoplastic conditions of patients enrolled on the study . The most frequently reported AEs for 
xentuzumab monotherapy  were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting .
Infusion- related reaction (I RR) is a listed side effect of xentuzumab treatment.
Promising early efficacy  signals in the dose 
escalation part of the [ADDRESS_934079] been 
observed with two confirmed antitumour responses (Partial Responses) according to RECI ST 
criteria in a patient with nasophary ngeal cancer and a patient with a peripheral primitive 
neuroectodermal tumour (PPNET) or Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, twelve confirmed disease 
stabilizations (SD) have been observed in heavil y pre -treated patients suffering from advanced 
or metastatic solid tumours. In the expansion cohorts at R2PD, no further objective responses 
have been observed.
At a planned interim analy sis of the randomized phase II part, based on the recommendation 
of data monitoring committee, recruitment of phase II part was stopped and xentuzumab 
treatment was disconti nued. According to latest analy sis, i
n the overall population, PFS did not 
improve with the addition of xentuzumab to everolimus plus exemestane . Nevertheless, a 
favorable signal was observed in the pre-specified subgroup of patients without visceral 
metas tasis ( report c22665932 -01).
In the aforementioned ongoing trial in HR+ metastatic breast cancer, the safet y profile of 
xentuzumab in combination with everolimus and exemestane is considered favourable and as 
expected, since the observed safet y profile of this triple combination is consistent with 
previously  reported data for the combination doublet everolimus and exemestane (Bolero -2 
trial) (Baselga et al. 2011: R12- 5635). The same applies for the combination with enzalutamide 
in CRPC, where the safety  profile of this doublet is consistent with previously  reported data 
for enzalutamide (Affirm and Prevail trials) ( R13-1229, R15 - 1307 ). 
Abema ciclib
Abemaciclib (LY2835219) is a small -molecule inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 that is 
structurally  distinct from other dual inhibitors (such as palbociclib and ribociclib) and notably 
exhibits greater selectivity  for CDK4 compared with CDK6. Consistent with its activity  against 
CDK4 and CDK6, abemaciclib inhibits Rbphosphorylation and leads to G [ADDRESS_934080] in RB-
proficient cell lines. In a  colorectal cancer xenograft model used to develop an integrated 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic model, abemaciclib can be dosed orally  on a continuous 
schedule to achieve sustained target inhibition and demonstrates not only  durable cell cycle

physical and pharmacokinetic (PK) propert ies, an acceptable toxicity  profile in nonclinical 
species, and antitumour activity  in multipl e mouse models of human cancer.
Tumour growth inhibition is observed in multiple other human cancer xenograft models, 
including those derived from non–small cell lung cancer (NSCL C), melanoma, glioblastoma, 
and mantle cell lymphoma. Abemaciclib distributes across the blood –brain barrier and 
prolongs survival in an intracranial glioblastoma xenograft model, suggesting potential 
efficacy  against primary  and metastati c tumours involving the central nervous system (R16-
3982 ). Importantl y, abemaciclib has demonstrated early evidence of activity  against HR+ mBC 
with a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 19.7% in therecent Monarch 1 study (R16-
5327 ). 
Abemaciclib has been approved by [CONTACT_688645]. The approval include combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial 
endocrine -based therap y for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2 − 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer (Monarch 3), in combination with fulvestrant for the 
treatment of women with HR+, HER2 − advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease 
progression following endocrine therapy .(Monarch 2), and as monotherapy  for the treatment 
of HR+, HER2− advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following 
endocrine therap y and prior chemotherap y in the metastatic setting (Monarch 1).
The approval of abemac iclib plus fulvestrant was based on 
Monarch [ADDRESS_934082] cancer. A total of 669 patients who had disease progression following 
endocrine therap y and h ad not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease we re randomized 
2:1 to either oral abemaciclib or placebo plus intramuscular fulvestrant injection. Treatment 
was continued in the absence of disease progression or unmanageable toxicity . The study  was 
positive for primary  endpoint investigator -assessed PFS. Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant 
significantl y
 improved PFS versus placebo plus fulvestrant (median 16.[ADDRESS_934083]

profile (Stud y JPBA and Monarch 1 trial; R16-3982, R16- 5327 ). In September 2017, 
abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant was approved by [CONTACT_688646]-positive, HER2- negative advanc ed or metastatic breast cancer with disease 
progression following endocrine therapy (R18-
2693). Oncogenic activation of the PI3K–
mTOR pathway , which is governed by [CONTACT_14799]1/IGF -1R, is also capable of stimulating cyclin D1–
CDK4/6 activity, due in part to the increased translation of the cyclin D1 mRNA transcript, 
and to the stabilization of the cyclin D1 protein (see R16-3979 ). This scenario prompts the 
implementation of triple combination studies involving the addition of a IGF/IGF -1R 
signalling inhibitor such as xentuzumab , to the established antihormonal plus CDK4/6 inhibitor 
regimens in the present trial. I t seems likely  that CDK4/[ADDRESS_934086] 
effective when used in combination with other agents that either reinforce the cytostatic activity 
of CDK4/[ADDRESS_934087] or cell 
death (R16-3979). In this regard, preclinical and clinical data indica te that aberrant regulation 
of the IGF sy stem is attributed to the pathogenesis of breast cancer and also contributes to the 
resistance to endocrine therap y (R16-3981 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_688602] C, these neoplasms basicall y 
remain intractable in the metastatic setting, with a median overall survival of less than 12 
months in patients with stage IV disease. Hence, new therapeutic approaches are urgently 
warranted in these areas of high unmet me dical need. The IGF/IGF -1R signalling network has 
also been implicated in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. Specifically, a large body of literature has 
highlighted the ability  of IGF/IGF -1R to mediate resistance to other treatment modalities in 
NSCL C, and conversel y has identified proteins capable of compensating for IGF -1R blockade 
(P15-
[ZIP_CODE]).
Early evaluations of ongoing clinical trials of anti-IGF/IGF -1R agents including xentuzumab
as a single agent, as well as in combination with everolimus and exemestane in HR+ BC ( P16-
[ZIP_CODE] ), have shown clinical benefit (objective tumour responses or disease stabilizations) in 
patients with advanced and otherwise incu rable cancers. 
The insulin -like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) signalling pathway  has been an active area of 
oncology  research for the last decade. IGF-1R is present on most cancer cells, and inhibition 
of this receptor slowed tumour growth and increase d the antitumour activity of chemotherap y, 
radiation, and biologic agents in xenograft models. In addition, activation of the IGF-1R 
pathway  has been postulated as a mechanism of signalling escape from other anticancer 
treatments including hormones and targeted agents, including CDK4/[ADDRESS_934088], a drug synergy  screen and network modelling in dedifferentiated liposarcoma 
recentl y identified CDK4 and IGF-1R as synergistic drug targets (R16-0845 ). Further 
experim ents confirmed that combined inhibition of CDK4 and IGF-1R cooperativel y 
suppresses the activation of proteins within the AKT pathway . These data suggest that dual

More recently , Heilman and co-workers found that concurrent targeting of CDK4/6 and IGF-
1R resulted in synergistic effects on proliferation of CDKN2A -mutant PaC cell lines in vitro 
and potent suppression of tumour growth in vivo, sugge sting that alterations in these pathways 
converge to promote the growth of CDKN2A -deleted PaC cells ( R16-0844). 
This study  therefore aims to determine the safet y, toxicity  and recommended phase II dose 
(RP2D) as well as potential early efficacy  signals for the further development of the 
combination therapy of xentuzumab and abemaciclib in a variety  of cancers with a high unmet 
medical need, especiall y NSCL C. In an attempt to further improve outcomes for patients with 
HR+ BC, the combination of abemaciclib, xentuzumab and hormonal therapy  (fulvestrant) is 
also investigated in this trial in expansion cohorts to determine the RP2D and efficacy  for that
triple combination. After the US FDA’s approval of abemaciclib in combination with 
fulvestrant and based on the above mentioned potential synergy  with supports the triple 
combination (xentuzumab, abemaciclib, and endocrine therap y), expansion cohorts in patients 
HR-positive, HER2- negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer will be a dded to this trial to 
evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of triple combination of xentuzumab, abemaciclib, and 
fulvestrant. Early efficacy  signal of addition of xentuzumab to new standard -of-care could be 
obtained in the expansion cohorts.
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
For each dose finding cohorts (A, B, C and D):
The primary objective of each dose finding cohort is to determine the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) / recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib 
with or without hormonal ther apy (letrozole, anastrozole, fulvestrant). Dose limiting toxicities 
(DLT) will be assessed during the first treatment cycle to assess the MTD/RP2D.
In case that no MTD is reached a RP2D dose will be determined taking into account safet y data 
and other ava ilable information. This will be agreed with the Steering Committee. 
For each expansion cohorts (E , F, D1 and D2):
The objective of the cohort Eisto assess the 
anti-tumour activity  of xentuzumab in combination 
with abemaciclib in patients with non- small cell lung cancer .
Cohort Fwill assess the anti-tumour activit y of the triplet combination xentuzumab / 
abemaciclib and fulvestrant in a single -arm expansion group of patients with locally  advanced 
/ metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR+) HER2-breast cancer who have progressed 
following prior therapy with an aromatase inhibitor and a different CDK4/6 inhibitor 
(excluding abemaciclib) . 
Theprimary  objective of cohort s
D1 and D2 is to assess the anti -tumour activity  of the triplet 
combination xentuzumab , abemaciclib and fulvestrant in patients with locally  advanced / 
metastatic HR+ breast cancer who have progressed on prior endocrine therapy . Cohort D1

2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSES SMENT
There is a high unmet medical need for patients with advanced or metastatic HR+ BCand
NSCL C, as described in Sections 1.1and 2.1.Both abemaciclib and xentuzumab have shown 
encouraging preliminary  anti- cancer activity  in early -phase clinical trials.
Therefore, and because this trial will enrol patients without curative therapeutic options, it is 
believed that patients with solid tumours, NSCLCor HR+ BC treated with xentuzumab plus 
abemaciclib with or without hormonal background therap y at standard doses will have better 
efficacy  (clinical benef it) compared to abemaciclib with or without hormonal background 
therap yalone.
Abemaciclib
Hematologic toxicities including neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, and thrombocy topenia 
have been observed in patients treated with abemaciclib, and causality  has been established. 
Patients will therefore be monitored closely
 for signs of infection, anaemia, and bleeding. 
Gastrointestinal toxicities including diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting have been observed in 
patients treated with abemaciclib, and causalit y has been established. Patients will therefore be 
monitored closely  for gastrointestinal side effects. Patients with these symptoms will be 
evaluated promptly , treated supportivel y, and monitored closel y for sequelae such as 
dehy dration. Because diarrhoea possib ly related to abemaciclib has been manageable with 
standard antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide, earl y treatment of diarrhoea is recommended 
in this trial.
Xentuzumab
As of 18 January  2019, xentuzumab was well tolerated in clinical trials, with no relevant 
specific side effects reported. The type and pattern of adverse events (AEs) observed to date 
have generally  been of mild to moderate intensity (CTCAE Grades 1 or 
2) or consistent with 
the safet y profile of combination backbone treatment or consisten t with the underl ying 
neoplastic conditions of patients enrolled on the study . The most frequently reported AEs for 
xentuzumab monotherapy were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting .
Infusion-related reaction (IRR) is a listed side effect of xentuzumab treatment. There have been 
3 serious IRRs reported. One event was Grade 3 or higher. All events recovered with 
management per protocol. Only  1 patient discontinued the study  due to an infusion-related 
reaction. Infusions of xentuzumab should be administered under close supervision of a 
medically  qualified staff member with availability  of resuscitation facilities. As mannitol is

this trial. 
Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury  (DILI) is under constant surveillance 
by [CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this trial requires timel y detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations in selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients’ 
safet y, see also Section 5.3 .6.1.
More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably  anticipated 
adverse events (AEs) of abemaciclib and xentuzumab may be found in the Investigators’ 
Brochures (IBs) (see current versions). Information on AEs expected to be related to the 
investigational product may be found in Section 
7 of the IBs. Information on serious adverse 
events (SAEs) expected in the study population independent of drug exposure and that will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_240209], periodically  during the course of the study , may be found 
in Sections 6 (Effects in Humans) of the IBs.
The sponsor, monitor, and investigators will perform this study  in compliance with the 
protocol, good clinical practice (GCP) and International Conference on Harmonis ation (ICH) 
guidelines, and applicable regulatory  requirements.
During the trial, investigators are advised to manage treatment -related side-effects proactively . 
Suggested supportive care measures for the management of treatment related AEs and 
instructio ns for dose reductions for individual patients are provided in Section 4.4
Regular and frequent assessment of clinical benefit throughout the trial will ensure that any 
patient not deriving clinical benefit will be withdrawn from the trial treatment. The safety  of 
all patients, dose selection and benefit/risk assessment are under frequent surveillance by a 
Steering Committee (SC) (refer to Section 3.1.1). The SC will carefully  assess the observed 
benefits and adverse events and give advice on potential treatment discontinuation.
Based on the good safet y profiles of xentuzumab and abemaciclib, as well as standard hormonal 
therap y with letrozole, anastrozole or fulvestrant, as single agents, it is expected that the 
combination treatment can be safel y initiated at the doses specified in Section 4.1.2.
As part of the trial, patients are required to provide blood samples and archival tumour tissue 
to anal yse candidate predictive biomarkers, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity . For blood 
samples, in some instances this is alread y becoming standard clinical practice at specialised 
oncology  centres, but for some patients this will be an additional procedure compared to routine 
clinical practice. Apart from that, there are no invasive procedures in addition to standard 
oncology  practice.
Based on the disease under study , the inclusion of women of childbearing potential, using 
contraception as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], in this study  is justified. To minimize the risk of 
unintentional exposure of an embry o or foetus to the investigational drug, men and women of 
childbearing potential must agree to the requirements for pregnancy  testing and contraceptive 
methods described in this protocol.

manageable for each compound. Safe doses will be established for each set of combination 
partners during the dose finding parts ofthe trial. It is expected that those combinations will 
improve the efficacy  of abemaciclib in NSCL C as well as abemaciclib in combination with 
hormonal therap y in HR+ BC (i.e. letrozole, anastrozole, fulvestrant) b y delay ing or reversing 
the resistance mechanisms to these drugs. Additionally , abemaciclib and xentuzumab have 
exhibited preliminary  activity  signal in cancers with a high unmet medical need for a new 
treatment armamentarium.
Based on the pharmacological mechanism and existing non-clinical and clinical data, there is 
currentl y no definitive evidence that xentuzumab, either as monotherap y or in combination 
with abemaciclib/endocrine therapy , will increase the occurrence or worse n the outcomes of a 
COVID -
[ADDRESS_934096] one prior endocrine based regimen, the benefit -risk 
assessment for xentuzumab remains positive also in the pr esence of a COVID -19 outbreak. 
The decision on whether to continue study  drugs if a patient develops COVID -19 will be left 
to the investigator’s benefit/risk assessment on a case -by-case basis. Based on laboratory  data 
and any adverse event that may occur, the clinical trial protocol include guidance for 
continuation, interruption, dose reduction, and discontinuation of study  drugs.
In conclusion, given the good tolerability  profile, non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_688603] y of abemaciclib and xentuzumab as well as the established 
hormonal therap y (letrozole, anastrozole, fulvestrant) in the aforementioned life-threatening 
cancers with 
high unmet medical need, the potential benefits expected from xentuzumab in 
combination with abemaciclib with or without hormonal background therapy  are anticipated to 
outweigh its risks.

and non-visceral disease. No new safet y signals were observed with the addition of xentuzumab 
to the everolimus and exemestane combination.
In consideration of these top line results of 1280
-0022, as of 19 October 2021, Boehringer 
Ingelheim recommended to immediately  discontinue xentuzumab treatment. Sites were also 
recommended to discontinue associated assessments, including central laborato ry sampling.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This trial is an open -label, non-randomised, phase Ib international, multicentre study  of the 
combination of xentuzumab and abemaciclib (doublet) with or without a background of 
hormonal therap y, such as 2.5 mg letrozole or 1 mg anastrozole or 500 mg fulvestrant (referred 
to as triplets) .
The study  consists of
-4 dose finding cohorts (A, B, C, D (dose finding) ) and 
-4expansion cohorts (E, F, D1 and D
2)
The different dose levels to be used at each cohort are described under Section 4.1.2.
The study  will be conducted, chronologicall y, in 3 parts: 
Part 1
Cohort A is a dose finding cohort in approximately  12 evaluable patients to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D 1) of the doublet 
xentuzumab and abemaciclib in solid tumours. Once the RP2D 1has been established Part 2 of 
this trial will commence. 
Part 2 (all cohorts in part 2 can be conducted in parallel)
Cohort B is a dose finding cohort in approximately  12 evaluable patients to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D 2) of the triplet 
xentuzumab and abemaciclib and letrozole in breast cancer. 
Cohort C is a dose finding cohort in approximately  12 evaluable patients to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D 3) of the triplet 
xentuzumab and abemaciclib and anastrozole in breast cancer. 
Cohort D(dose finding) is a triplet- dose finding investigation in approximately  12evaluable 
patients to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D 4) of the triplet xentuzumab and abemaciclib and fulvestrant in breast cancer. Once the 
RP2D 4has been established Part [ADDRESS_934099] cancer patients evaluable for response. Based on the 
subgroup findings from the previous study 1280.4 (see Section 1.2), cohort F will recruit 
patients without visceral disease.
Cohort D1 and Cohort D2 will be opened once the RP2D 4of Cohort D (dose finding) has been 
determined. At least 30 patients will be treated to evaluate anti-tumour activity , safet y, and 
pharmacokinetics of the triplet combination in Cohorts D1 and D2. Cohort D1 will recruit 
patients with visceral metastasis (at least one visceral metas tasis) andCohort D2 will recruit 
patients with non-visceral metastasis (absence of visceral metastasis). Visceral metastasis is

is not required for this investigation.

-10 Trial Protocol Page 50of 177
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934105]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015As no data on the optimal dose for the xentuzumab /abemaciclib combination therapy  exist so 
far, the study  will first determine the MTD 1/RP2D 1of the double drug regimen (in Part 1 cohort 
A) prior to further exploring its anti- tumour activity  in Part 2.
The dose escalation/de -escalation steps and the dose-level cohort sizes (in each dose finding 
cohort) will bedetermined based on the recommendation of the SC, guided by a Bayesian 
model with overdose control. A potential escalation with overdose control design will increase 
the flexibility  in terms of intermediate dose levels and number of patients in each dose-level 
cohort. This will increase the chance of treating patients at efficacious doses, while reducing 
the risk of overdosing. This design is not only  an efficient method for dose finding studies, but 
also for dose confirmation studies due to its flexibilit y to react to unforeseen toxicity  rates 
(R13-4802). This design is based on practical experience and is an efficient method due to its 
ability  to identify the dose with a desired toxicity  rate and its allocation of a greater pro portion 
of patients to doses at, or close to, that desired dose (R13-4802, R13- 4804, R13- 4805). The use 
of Bayesian models for Phase I studies has also been advocated by [CONTACT_688648] ( R07- 4856) and by  [CONTACT_1622] ( R16-2270 ).
In expansion cohorts , a single arm design is justified as the trial is exploratory  in its design to 
generate safety  and eff icacy  data. If a positive efficacy  signal is observed in this trial, a 
comparative trial may  be considered if deemed justified.
The primary endpoint of the expansion cohorts is Objective Response (OR) or PFS rate, which 
is a well -accepted endpoint for such studies. OR rate defined as the proportion of patients with 
tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period is used as primary 
endpoint for cohort E and F . PFS18 defined as the proportio n of patients who were absence of 
disease progression or death at 18thmonth is use as primary  endpoint for cohort s
D1 and D2. 
A good response of sufficient duration is reasonably  likely surrogate for clinical benefit in 
refractory  solid tumour indications or where there is no effective therap y.
PK assessments in the dose escalation cohorts (A, B, C, D(dose finding )) will be limited to the 
assessment of immunogenicity  (anti-drug antibodies ADA) together with a concomitant PK 
sample for xentuzumab . The basic PK properties of each of the components have been 
described alread y.
The potential development of ADAs (immunogenicity against xentuzumab) will be monitored
in all patients throughout the trial duration and beyo nd this (at 
EOTV and FUV). Regulatory 
guidelines recommend the monitoring of immunogenicity  before, during and beyond treatment. 
A concomitant PK sample is necessary  in order to assess whether an ADA sample result is 
conclusive or not and to monitor whether any effects of potential ADAs affect the drug 
concentration.
According to guidelines, combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_688607]. Therefore, PK investigations of the combination

exploratory  fashion. This approach ensures that a certain number of patients, treated at the same 
dose, can be evaluated. An intraindividual assessment of the PK of abemaciclib with and 
without xentuzumab treatment is planned for cohort E. These investigations are performed 
when the drug to be investigated is at stead y state. In order to reach stead y state levels with the

of the combination is planned to be performed at stead y state as well. Xentuzumab reaches 
steady  state after around 30d, therefore, the assessment of the combination treatment will be 
conducted in the second treatment cy cle (that is >[ADDRESS_934107] xentuzumab infusion). 
The exposure of xentuzumab will be evaluated descriptively  and only  a historical comparison 
to mono -treatment with xentuzumab will be done.
In cohort s D1 and D2no intraindividual comparison of abemaciclib is planned. Exposure to 
abemaciclib, fulvestrant and xentuzumab is to be evaluated descriptively and only compared 
across cohorts or to historical or literature data for fulvestrant .
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not. 
It is estimated that a total of about 148evaluable patients will be necessary to determine the 
MTD or the Recommended Phase 
II Dose, pharmacokinetics and efficacy  of xentuzumab and 
abemaciclib with or without background hormone treatment.
Part 1 of the trial will be conducted in about 3-6 sites in US, Europe and Japan. Parts 2 and 3 
of the trial will be conducted in about 40sites in US, Europe and Japan. If needed, sites from 
other regions may also participate. Each site is expected to enrol about one to five pa tients. If 
site(s) are unable to recruit patients, additional sites may  be opened and underperforming sites 
may be closed.

prior to enrolment as well as an explanation of the consequences of premature withdrawal. 
An individual patient is to be withdrawn from trial treatment if:
*The patient withdraws consent for trial treatment or trial participation, without the need to 
justify  the decision.
*The patient develops unequivocal disease progression, supported by  [CONTACT_688651].
*The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational product 
or other trial medication in the o pi[INVESTIGATOR_688611].
*The patient can no longer be treated with trial medication for other medical reasons (such 
as surgery , adverse events, other diseases, or pregnancy )
*The patient has repeatedly shown to be non -compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15566], the investigator and sponsor representative, is not willing or 
able to stick to the trial requirements in the future. (See Section 4.3 )
*The trial is terminated for any of the reasons listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ” Discontinuation of 
the trial by  [CONTACT_456]” .
Given the patient’s agreement, the patient will undergo the procedures for earl y treatment 
discontinuati on and follow up as outlined in the Flow Chart (FC) and Section 6.2.3 .
For all patients the reason for withdrawal (e.g. adverse events) must be recorded in the eCRF. 
These data will be included in the trial database and reported.

b.When all patients have discontinued xentuzumab treatment , if any patient on 
abemaciclib and fulvestrant is able to continue taking these approved medications off 
study , then, at the request of the Sponsor, the patient may end such treatment as part of 
the trial and discontinue study  participation (if both the Investigator and patient agree ).
c.After all patients end treatment with all study  drugs, the trial will be terminated.
3. Violation of GCP, the CTP, or the contract disturbing the appropriate conduct of the trial
The Investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).
3.3.5 Replacement of patients 
Patients may  be replaced for determination of the primary  endpoint (MTD) in cases of:
Patient’s withdrawal during the first cy cle of treatment for reasons other than DLT, e.g. 
patient no longer wishes to participate, or lost to follow up during first cy cle.
Patients who do not experi ence D LT, but miss more than one dose of xentuzumab during 
the first cy cle of treatment , except for dose interruption caused b y AE
Patients who do not experience DLT, but miss [ADDRESS_934142] cy cle of treatment ,
except for dose interruption caused by  
[CONTACT_117795].
Patients who miss one complete cy cle at an y time beyond the first cycle of treatment may 
be replaced after discussion between the sponsor and the investigator.
Patients who are non-evaluable with respect to DLT.
Patients with CTCAE grade ≥3 allergic reaction/hy persensitivity  to the study  drug(s) 
within the first cy cle may be replaced.
For cohorts E and F, where objective response or DC is the primary  endpoint: if patient 
doesn't have post -treatment radiological tumor assessment for reason other than 
worsening of underly ing disease
Patients that have been replaced might continue treatment in the trial should criteria in Section 
4.1.4. 2apply; however these patients will not be considered for analysis of the primary  
endpoint.

4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial
[IP_ADDRESS] Part 1 
A semi -mechanistic PK/PD model was developed describing the kinetics of the interaction 
between xentuzumab and the different PD biomarkers (i.e. IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP3). 
Simulations using this model indicate that a weekly  dosing of 1000 mg xentuzumab reduces 
free IGF-1 concentration by [CONTACT_726] 90% and in addition free IGF-2 by 64 % at trough 
steady -state relative to pre -treatment; this is considered a relevant biological effect.
Therefore, a weekly dose of 1000 mg xentuzumab is considered a suitable dos e.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934148]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015In dose finding cohort A, the starting dose of abemaciclib is 150 mg every 12 (±2) hours. 
Based on the recommended phase II dose in one dose finding stud y using combination of a 
targeted therap y agent with xentuzumab (please refer to the current versio n of the 
Investigator's Brochure, c01690707-08
), a dose level of 1000 mg with weekly  dose schedule 
is selected as the starting dose for this study . This dose combination has a prior probability  of 
overdosing below 25% (see Section 7.1). Planned dose levels for patients in cohort A are 
display ed in Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1 below.
Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1 Concomitant dosing schedule schemes of Cohort A
Dose level Xentuzumab (mg weekl y) Abemaciclib (mg/12h)
DL0 (starting dose) [ADDRESS_934149] dose levels planned as shown above will not be considered. 
Above dose levels may be modified and/or additional dose levels/administration regimens may 
be added based on safety  profile and other emerging data upon discussion and agreement 
between the sponsor and the SC.
Intra -patient dose escalation is not permitted . Successive dose-level cohorts of patients will 
receiv e doses of xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib until the MTD 1/RP2D 1is 
established or until the trial is terminated for other reasons (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The trial may 
be terminated at any time based on emerging safet y concerns without establishing the 
MTD 1/RP2D 1.
For any dose-level cohort, at least [ADDRESS_934150] one course (28 days) without experiencing a DLT, the Bayesian model 
will be updated with the newly  accumulated data. The SC will then determine the dose regimen 
for the next dose-level cohort, based on the available toxicity  information (including DLTs, 
AEs that are not DLTs, and AE information post -cycle 1), recommendations from the BL RM, 
and other data (e.g. anti-tumour activity , pharmacokinetics) if applicable. Details on the
Bayesian design are provided in Sections 7.1 and Appendix 10.6 .

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934151]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015The overdose risk will be calculated for each further dose combination, and patient enrolment 
into dose levels will be permitted to all dose combinations which fulfil the escalation with 
overdose control (EWOC) criterion. Based on the Bayesian model and the additional 
information as defined above, the SC will decide on the next dose level to be investigated. In 
the SC meeting, data for each patient in the current dose-level cohort will be described in detail, 
updated safet y data on other ongoing patients, including data in later courses, will be discussed 
as well.
The SC must reach a consensus on whether to de
-escalate, re-escalate and/or expand 
recruitment into particular cohorts, or to declare the MTD 1/RP2D 1. BI will prepare minutes 
from the SC meetings and circulate them to each Investigator.
To further assess the safet y (e.g. specific suspected treatment -related adverse events) of 
xentuz umab in combination with abemaciclib, one or several doses that are considered 
acceptabl y safe, i.e. shown to be lower than or equal to any potential MTD, may be explored 
to determine the RP2D 1. Nevertheless, a minimum of 6 evaluable patients need to be tr eated at 
the MTD 1/RP2D 1in the dose finding cohort A prior to starting part 2 (cohorts B, C, D and E) 
and any  dose declared as MTD 1/RP2D 1by [CONTACT_688652] (EWOC) criteria.
The SC may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_688612] A after the criterion for MTD 
(Section 7.1) is fulfilled. Further patients may be included to confirm the MTD 1/RP2D 1
estimate, i.e. to confirm that the EWOC criterion is still fulfilled prior to the start of part 2 
(cohorts B, C, D and E ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Part 2
The decision on dose escalation/de -escalation, MTD (or Biological Relevant Dose) and RP2D 
will be determined in discussion with at least BI Trial Clinical Monitor, BI project physician 
(TMM) and Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_688613]’ safety . This decision 
will be documented.
Dose finding cohorts B,
Cand D (dose finding) :
For each cohort, starting dose of xentuzumab and abemaciclib will be the RP2D 1determined 
in cohort A, even if RP2D 1equals the highest dose levels planned (see Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1). This 
is because the maximum dose of abemaciclib to be explored in triple combination cohorts is 
150mg b.i.d. In that case, the starting dose would then be 1000 mg weekly  xentuzumab plus 
150 mg / 12h abemaciclib.
In the three cohorts, patients will receive the dose of background hormonal therapy  as defined 
in Tables 4.1.1: 3 to 4.1.1: 5 (i.e. letrozole in cohort B , anastrozole in Cohort C and fulvestrant 
in cohort D ).
Dose escalation/de- escalation of xentuzumab and abemaciclib will be conducted as described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] for cohort A using a BLRM with a fixed dose of the background hormonal 
therap y.

For Cohort F and Cohorts D 1 and D2 patients will be treated at the RP2D 4of abemaciclib 
and xentuzumab and fulvestrant triplet as determined in Cohort D(dose finding) . 
4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
For the dose finding cohorts, the treatment slots are assigned by  [CONTACT_688653] (CM) 
in close communication (email/phone/fax) with the recruiting sites and I RT system and will be 
assigned on a competitive basis. After the BI Clinical Monitor has been notified by a site about 
a potential patient, theslot will be reserved to this site for a period of time (approximately  a 
week) until patient signs ICF, otherwise the slot will be opened up again for all recruiting sites. 
If more than one site notifies potential patients and there are no slots for all proposed 
candidates, BI Clinical Monitor will allocate the slot prioritizing by [CONTACT_688654], 
balanced number of patients per site and other parameters as applicable. 
Patients that meet the eligibility  criteria and who have given their written informed 
consent 
may not be entered into the study  depending on the cohort which is being explored at that 
particular time (for example, but not restricted to, the dose finding cohort A). This needs to be 
discussed and agreed with BI Trial Team.
Prior to inclusion of a new patient, once the slot has been confirmed, the investigator should 
also confirm the respective dose with the BI clinical monitor.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
The treatment medication assignment for xentu zumab and abemaciclib will be managed 
through IRT system. The treatment medication assignment for anastrozole, letrozole and 
fulvestrant will be managed through IRT s ystem in certain countries only . 
In addition, patient’s screening, run -in, all drug dispe nsation visits and EOTV will be collected 
in the I RT s ystem.
[IP_ADDRESS] Initial stud y drug assignment and administration
General information that applies in this study  regardless of IRT is described in below sections 
of individual study  drug. The medication kit as we ll as the treatment will be assigned with the 
support from I RT. 
Before entering patients at the next dose level of the dose finding cohorts, it will be ensured 
that all patients at the current ongoing dose level have completed at least one course of 
treatment.

Patients will start treatment with their assigned dose tier (see Section 4.1.2 ) or RP2D of 
xentuzumab from course [ADDRESS_934154] be avoided. The infusion time may be extended to over one 
hour and up to a maximum of three hours in cases of CTCAE grade ≥ [ADDRESS_934155] 
be recorded in the specific eCRF. The accuracy  of this information is crucial for the proper 
evaluation and appraisal of the pharmacokinetics –in the relevant cohorts –and other data.
Detailed information of dispensation, preparation, and handling of xentuzumab will be 
described in ISF.
Abemaciclib
Abemaciclib will be taken orall y every  12 (± 2) hours on days 1 through 28 of a 28 -day cycle 
for a total of 56 doses per cycle. During all cycles, abemaciclib should be taken at 
approximately  the same times each day . If a patient misses or vomits a dose, that dose should 
be omitted.
No more than 56 doses of abe maciclib should be dispensed for each 28 -day cycle.
Abemaciclib dose omissions will be evaluated on a case by [CONTACT_688655] a dose finding cohort or if the number 
of dose omissions make s the patient non evaluable regardless of the cohort. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Temporary  treatment interruption and dose reduction
DLT, or those AEs requiring dose adjustment as indicated on the label, should be managed b y 
treatment interruptions and subsequent dose reductions ofthe presumed causal study  drug(s) 
according to the schedule described in Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1.Please also refer to Section 4.4 for 
additional recommendations. 
In case of an intolerable adverse event which is suspected to be related to either xentuzumab 
or abemaciclib in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8925], the treatment can be interrupted with subsequent 
dose reduction for the suspected agent(s) according to Tables [IP_ADDRESS]: 1(xentuzumab) and 
[IP_ADDRESS]: 2 (abemaciclib). 
In the case of DLT with suspected overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_688614], or considered related to both xentuzumab and abemaciclib 
the dosing with both study  drugs should be held until the adequate resolution of AE (CTCAE 
grade ≤1). Treatment should then be resumed and/or dose reduced as shown inTable [IP_ADDRESS]: 
1for xentuzumab and in Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 2 for abemaciclib.
Recurrent in the context of dose interruptions and delays refers to the same event and severit y 
occurring within 8 weeks (as measured from the stop date of the first event). This does not

later).
Further to these recommendations, in Part 1, Cohort A, both xentuzumab and abemaciclib must 
be paused when a DLT occurs during the first treatment course.
The treatment should be paused until patient has recovered from the DLT tograde ≤ 1 or 
baseline. Baseline is defined as the CTCAE grade at the start of treatment. For patients who 
develop DLT, treatment may  be resumed at reduced dose according to dose reduction scheme 
of the patient’s starting dosage. If a patient has not recovered to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_934157] be permanently  discontinued. In the event that the patient is 
deriving obvious clinical benefit according to the investigator’s judgement, further treatment 
with study  drug(s) will be deci ded in agreement between the sponsor and the investigator.
If one or more of the study drugs is permanently discontinued, the patient can remain on either 
abemaciclib or xentuzumab or endocrine therap y only .
Dose reductions will apply  to individual patie nts only. Doses of xentuzumab and/or 
abemaciclib can be reduced independent of each other. Once the treatment dose of xentuzumab 
is reduced for a particular patient, it should not be increased back to the previous dose.
Abemaciclib dose adjustments are allowed within a cycle and between cycles. Abemaciclib 
must be reduced sequentially  by [CONTACT_30560]. For further instructions as regards dose 
adjustments of abemaciclib, please refer to Section 4.2.2.
For patients requiring dose reduction(s) of abemaciclib, any  re-escalation to a prior dose level 
is permitted only after discussion and agreement with the sponsor. After re-escalation, 
subsequent dose adjustments should be based on the dose of abemaciclib that the patient is 
current ly receiving.

4.2 OTHER TREATMENTS, EM ERGENCY PROCEDURES, 
RESTRICTIONS
4.2.1 Other treatments and emergency procedures
There are no special emerg ency  procedures to be followed.
Symptomatic treatments of tumour -associated symptoms are allowed. Concomitant 
medications or therap y to provide adequate supportive care may be given as clinicall y 
necessary .
After study  enrolment, palliative radiotherap y may be given for analgesic purposes, lytic 
lesions at risk of fracture or for other reasons (e.g. bronchial obstruction, skin lesions), provided 
that the total dose delivered is in a palliative range to non-target lesion according to institutional 
standard s. Information on palliative radiotherapy  will be captured in eCRF. It is at the 
investigator’s discretion to withhold the study  treatment during palliative radiotherap y. The 
investigators should assess the signs/sy mptoms carefull y to exclude the progressi ve disease 
prior to the administration of the palliative radiotherap y.
The acute use of bisphosphonates and denosumab for symptomatic treatment of bone 
metastases is permitted during the stud y, but chronic use for the prevention of bone metastases 
is proh ibited. Bisphosphonate therapy  for the treatment of osteoporosis, at the doses indicated 
under prescribing information, is permitted during the study . If bisphosphonate therapy  is 
initiated after enrolment, the reason for its use must be clearl y documented in the eCRF.

If patients receive par enteral nutrition during the trial, the components need not be specified in 
detail. It should just be indicated as “parenteral nutrition”. If a patient requires anaesthesia, it 
will be sufficient to indicate “anaesthesia” without specifying details.
In case of major surgery  (as judged by [CONTACT_093]), it is recommended to stop treatment 
with xentuzumab and/or abemaciclib around one week prior to the surgery , and to restart 
treatment after complete wound healing. If the patient can’t recover within 28 days since 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_14917], patient should be removed from the study . Exception to this in 
patients who derive obvious clinical benefit according to the investigator’s judgement could be 
agreed upon discussion with the Sponsor ’s Clinical Monitor.

Restrictions
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
With the exceptions listed in the sections below, no other chemotherap y, experimental 
medications, other anticancer therapy ,including but not limited toimmunotherap y, hormonal 
cancer therap y, radiation, experimental medications, or surgery  for cancer will be permitted 
while patients are on study  treatment. Use of megestrol acetate as an appetite stimulant is not 
permitted.
Abemaciclib is extensively  metabolized through oxidation by [CONTACT_097]3A.  In clinical drug 
interaction studies, coadministration of clarithromy cin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased 
exposure (AUC) to abemaciclib by  3.4 fold (Study  JPBE) and coadministration of rifampin, a 
strong CYP3A inducer, decreased exposure to abemaciclib by 95% (Study JPBF). Therefore, 
grapefruit juice should be avoided and inducers and strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be 
substituted or avoided whenever possible (See Appendix 10.1 ). 
During PK assessments of abemaciclib, the concomitant use of inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP3A4 should be avoided whenever possible, i.e. during Run-In, course [ADDRESS_934174] had a dose reduction to 100 mg twice 
daily  due to adverse reactions, further reduce the abemaciclib dose to 50 mg twice daily .If a 
patient taking abemaciclib discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the abemaciclib

inhibitor. Please refer to current S mPC of Verzenio (abemaciclib).
In case it is unavoidable to treat a patient with a comedication that is a moderate to potent 
inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4 dose adaptation of abemaciclib should be done as described 
above and according to the SmPC of Verzenio (abemaciclib). Furthermore, the patient should 
be closel y monitored and precautions should be taken as described in the SmPC of Verzenio 
(abemaciclib).
Abemaciclib can be coadministered with drug s which are substrates of CYP enzy mes.
Abemaciclib 
and/or its major metabolites inhibit the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and 
breast cancer resistance protein and renal transporters organic cation transporter 2, multidrug 
and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) ,and MATE2 -K at clinicall y relevant concentrations. 
Therefore, substrates of these transporters such as metformin and those with a narrow 
therapeutic index such as digoxin ,dofetilide ,or dabigatran should be substituted or avoided if 
possible.
Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment with fulvestrant, letrozole or anastrozole:  please 
refer to the most up to date labelling information of each product ,as appropriate (i.e. depending 
on the treatment cohort). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions on diet and life st yle
Patients have to show up in fasting condition at the site when blood draw for safet y lab is 
required.
Grapefruit and/or Seville orange juices must be avoided during treatment with abemaciclib.
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions regarding men and women of childbearing pote ntial 
Women of childbearing potential must use the contraception methods described in the patient 
information per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when 
used consistently  and correctl y. A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is 
provided in the patient information, and must be used from the screening period until 3weeks 
following the last dose of abemaciclib and at least [ADDRESS_934176] dose of xentuzumab.
[IP_ADDRESS] Supportive Care
Patients should receive full supportive care to maximize quality  of life. Patients will receive 
supportive care based on the judgment of the treating physician. If it is unclear whether a 
therap y should be regarded as supportive care, the investigator should consult the BI clinical 
monitor.

Growth factors may be administered in accordance with American Society  of Clinical 
Oncology  guidelines (Smith et al. 2006; Rizzo et al. 2008).
[IP_ADDRESS] Therap y for Diarrh oea
At enrolment, patients should receive instructions on the management of diarrhoea.  In t he 
event of diarrhoea, supportive measures should be initiated as earl y as possible .  These 
include the following:
*At the first sign of loose stools, the patient should initiate anti -diarrheal therapy , if not 
alread y receiving such therap y (for example, loperamide), and notify  the 
investigator/site for further instructions and appropriate follow -up.
*Patients should also be encouraged to drink fluids (for example, 8 to 10 glasses of 
clear liquids per day ).
*Site personnel should assess response within 24 hours. 
*If diarrhoea does not resolve with anti- diarrheal therap y within 24 hours to either 
baseline or Grade 1, study drug should be suspended until diarrhoea is resolved to 
baseline or Grade 1.
*When study  drug recommences, dosing should be adjusted, refer to the dose 
adjustment guidelines in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
In cases of significant diarrhoea, Grade 2 through 4 which has not responded to interventions 
as outlined above, if th e investigators are considering the addition of steroids to treat potential 
colitis, the sponsor strongl y recommends an endoscopic procedure to document colitis prior 
to initiating steroids.
In severe cases of diarrhoea, the measuring of neutrophil counts and body  temperature and 
proactive management of diarrhoea with antidiarrheal agents should be considered.
If diarrhoea is severe (requiring IV reh ydration) and/or associated with fever or severe 
neutropenia, broad- spectrum antibiotics such as fluoroquin olones must be prescribed.
Patients with severe diarrhoea or an y grade of diarrhoea associated with severe nausea or 
vomiting should be carefully  monitored and given intravenous fluid (IV h ydration) and 
electrol yte replacement.

intenti onally  or repeatedly taken more than 125% the prescribed amount of abemaciclib or less 
than 75%. Abemaciclib dose suspensions or delay s related to toxicity  may occur and will not 
result in a patient being considered as noncompliant. Same rules apply  to background hormonal 
therap y.
Patients are 
requested to bring all remaining trial medication including empty  package material 
with them when attending visits.
Based on counts, treatment compliance will be calculated as the number of doses taken, divided 
by [CONTACT_688660], 
multiplied by 100. Compliance will be verified by [CONTACT_21639]-site monitor authorised by [CONTACT_103].
Treatment compliance (%) =Number of doses actually  taken [ADDRESS_934180] been taken
If the number of doses taken is not between 75-125%, site staff will explain the patient the 
importance of treatment compliance.
The investigator and/or the sponsor can withdraw a patient from the study  in the event of 
serious and persistent non-compliance which jeopardizes the patient’s safety  or render study  
results. 
Xentuzumab will be administered as a single infusion under sup
ervision of the investigator or 
dedicated stud y personnel. I n the event that the full dose of xentuzumab is not administered to 
the patient, it must be documented and explained.
A maximum of three consecutive xentuzumab infusions may  be skipped for the recovery from 
AEs. Missing xentuzumab treatment for any other reasons is considered non -compliant.  
Patient diary for cohort E
For the purpose of PK characterisation of abemaciclib, patients of cohort E will be dispensed 
a patient diary two times during the conduct of the study : at run- in visit [ADDRESS_934181] information of the 3 day s before

4.4.1 Increased Serum Creatinine
Abemaciclib has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of renal tubular 
secretion of creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration rate (GFR [as measured by 
[CONTACT_688661]]).   In clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first 
month of abemaciclib dosing (remainder elevated but stable through the treatment period), 
were reversible upon treatment discontinuation, and were not accompanied by [CONTACT_688662], cy statin C, or calculated GFR based on 
cystatin C. 
Dose adjustment (omission, reduction, or discontinuation) should not solely  be based on 
interpretation of serum creatinine values because these may not reflect renal function.  If 
deterioration of renal function is suspected per the investigator’s clinical assessment, dose 
alteration should follow the protocol guidance for non-he matological toxicities (Secti on 
[IP_ADDRESS] ).
4.4.[ADDRESS_934183] treatment course, the observation period following xentuzumab infusion may 
be adjusted at the discretion of the investigators. Mild to moderate infusion reactions may be 
managed with a slower infusion rate and proph ylactic antihi stamines for subsequent dosing. 
Severe reactions require immediate and permanent discontinuation of infusion. The 
hypersensitivity  reactions will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AE) version 4.03 ( R10-4848). 
The infusion duration may be extended to over one hour and up to a maximum of three hours.
The infusion reactions should be treated symptomatically  as judged clinically  relevant by [CONTACT_192682] r. For symptomatic treatment of infusion reactions: hydrocortisone, antihistamines 
such as chlorphenamine accompanied by [CONTACT_688663]/analgesic and/or a bronchodilator is 
recommended.
Infusion reactions will not be reported on the standard AE page but will be reported on a 
separate page specifically for infusion reactions in the CRF.

Infusion Reaction Grade Management
CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 In the event of a CTCAE grade 1 infusion reaction, the infusion 
rate should be reduced by 50%. 
A Grade 2 infusion reaction may require symptomatic 
treatment , as described above (with infusion interruption ). 
Once the event has resolved, the infusion may berestarted at 
the reduced rate.
CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_934185] been observed in studies with xentuzumab and causalit y 
has been established with abemaciclib. Patients should be monitored closely  for signs of 
infection. Dose adjustment for severe neutropenia (≥ Grade 3) should follow as per Table 
[IP_ADDRESS]: 1 (xentuzumab) and Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 2 (abemaciclib) in the protocol. Fever or infection 
in the presence of severe neutropenia should be managed promptly  with broad -spectrum 
antibacterial therap y.

Grade ≥[ADDRESS_934186] 2 
months, monthly  for th e next 2 months, and as clinically  indicated. Please refer to Flow Chart
for time points. Based on the level of ALT elevations, abemaciclib may require dose 
modification. ( see Table [IP_ADDRESS]:2)
.
In addition, for hepatic toxicity , additional monitoring should be considered.  Details for 
hepatic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  test 
abnormalities . If the abnormality  persists or worsens, clinical and laborat ory monitoring should 
be initiated by  [CONTACT_093], based on the hepatic monitoring tests (see Section 10.5
)and in 
consultation with the Sponsor . Monitoring of ALT, AST, and total bilirubin should continue 
until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels. Additional diagnostic testing 
should be considered to rule out cause of increased liver enzy mes per the investigator’s 
discretion.

5.1 TRIAL ENDPOINTS
5.1.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
For dose finding cohorts A, B, C, and D (dose finding) :
The primary  endpoints for each dose finding cohort are the MTD and the number of patients 
with dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in the MTD evaluation period. 
The MTD evaluation period is defined as the first treatment cycle (28 days). The MTD is 
defined as the highest dose with less than 25% risk of the true DLT rate being above 33%. For 
definition of DLTs, refer to Section 5.3.7
A Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) employ ing the escalation with overdose 
control (EWOC) principle will be used during each dose finding cohort for a selection of doses 
to investigate and for estimation of the MTD. Cohorts of patients will receive xentuzumab and 
abemaciclib (with or without endocrine therap y) until the MTD is reached or until the Steering 
Committee (SC) decides on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_688618]. Each dose-level cohort will consist of 
newly  enrolled patients. Estimation of the MTD during each dose finding cohort of the study 
will be based upon the estimation of the probability of a DLT in the MTD evaluation period in 
the set of evaluable patients for MTD. The corresponding methodology is described in Section 
7.
The MTD estimate established during the dose finding cohort will be re -investigated after the 
corres ponding expansion cohort b y re-running the BL RM including all data from dose finding 
cohort and expansion cohort, in particular also considering the DLT information from all 
treatment cy cles.
For expansion cohort E
The primary  endpoint for expansion part is objective response (OR) defined as best overall 
response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), where best overall response is 
determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECI ST) version 1.[ADDRESS_934190] treatment administration (including run-infor cohort E)until the earliest of 
disease progression, death or last evaluable tumour assessment before start of subsequent anti -

laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may arise 
from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from 
occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authoriz
ation include off -label 
use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which:

is life -threatening, this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe.
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23235] 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956],
results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity , or
is a congenital anomal y / birth defect,
or
is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgment which may  jeopardise the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the above definitions.
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_688619] (SAEs) 
because there is no “adverse event” (i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence) as sociated 
with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3095] 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505950] (where the condition requiring the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36563])
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_688620], such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148829]. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148830]. Any  suspected transmission via a medicinal product of 
an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934204]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015For Japan only:the following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other reason”. 
An AE which possibly  leads to disability  will be reported as an SAE.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
Every  new occurrence of cancer of new histology  must be reported as a serious event regardless 
of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the cancer.
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency  initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by [CONTACT_15623], canalway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as given 
above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the EDC sy stem. 
These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described above.
Adverse events of special interest (AESI)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESI 
need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE, please see above.
The following are considered as AESIs: 
Hepatic injury is defined by  [CONTACT_35961]:
For patients with normal liver function (ALT, AST, and bilirubin within normal limits) at 
baseline, an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_934205] combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥ 2 fold UL N measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or marked peak 
aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥ [ADDRESS_934206].
For patients with abnormal liver function tests at baseline (AST and/or ALT > ULN), an 
elevation of transaminase ≥ (baseline + 4x ULN) combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_934207] 
their abnormaliti
es and the etiology  documented in detail as baseline conditions . Every  
effort should be made to explain possible deteriorations of baseline conditions.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the "DILI checklist" provided in the I SF.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopath y, 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, 
AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist shou ld be followed.
DLT occurs in the dose finding cohorts. Please refer to Section 5.3.7 for definition of DL Ts.

Intensity of AEs
The intensity  of adverse events should be classified and recorded according to the Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_934209] that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship could 
be:
•The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug. 
•The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
•A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
•Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re
-introduced.
•No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
•The event is typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug-related and infrequent in the general population not exposed 
to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
•An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
•No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks of 
drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned).
•Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into account 
the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may  not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
•Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underly ing diseases appear to provide a more likely 
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
•Disappearance of the event even though the study  drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

Investigator:
• From signing the informed consent onwards until the end of treatment (including the 
Residual Effect Period, REP): 
-All AEs (non- serious and serious) and all AESIs.
• After the end of treatment (including the REP) until the individual patient’s end of trial: 
- All related SAEs and all related AESIs.
•After the individual patient’s end of the trial: 
The Investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for AEs but should only  
report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the I nvestigator may  become aware of. 
The rules for Adverse Event Reporting exemptions still apply . 
Figure [IP_ADDRESS]: [ADDRESS_934212] trial medication application. All AEs which 
occurred through the treatment phase (which includes the run-in period) and throughout the 
REP will be considered as on treatment; please see Section 7.3.4. Events which occurred after 
the REP will be considered as post treatment events.
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
sponsor’s unique entry  point (country  specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF). 
The same timeline applies if follow -
up information becomes available. In specific occasions 
the Investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
For Japan only : all SAEs must be reported immediately to the head of the trial site.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934213]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial information.
Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate CRF 
pages and theBI SAE form. The Investigator should determine the causal relationship to the 
trial medication and any possible interactions between the investigational drug(s) and a Non-
Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP) / Auxiliary  Medicinal Product (AMP)
The fol lowing should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the CRF and SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] below)
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_737].
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed 
up until they have resolved, have been sufficientl y characterised, or no further information can 
be obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare cases pregnancy or pregnancy  in a female partner of a male participant may occur in a 
clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled into this clinical trial and has taken trial 
medication, the Investigator must report immediately  (within 24 hours) a potential drug 
exposure during pregnancy  (DEDP) including drug exposure to female partners of male 
participants to the sponsor’s unique entry  point (country -specific contact [CONTACT_688667]). The Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A) should be 
used.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Cli nical Trials (Part A and B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompan ying SAE 
and/or AESI , only the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is 
to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy  an SAE form 
must be completed in addition.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exemption to (S)AE Reporting
Exempted outcome events are:

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934214]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015Disease Progression is a trial endpoint for analysis of efficacy  and as such is exempted from 
reporting as an (S)AE. Progression of the subject's underlying malignancy  will be recorded on 
the appropriate pages of the (e)CRF as part of efficacy  data collection only and will not be 
reported on the SAE F orm. I t will therefore not be entered in the safet y database (ARISg) and 
hence not get expeditiously  reported. Death due to disease progression is also to be recorded 
on the appropriate (e)CRF page and not on the SAE Form.
However, when there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study  drug(s) 
and the progression of the underl ying malignancy, the event must be reported as an SAE on 
the SAE Form and on the (e)CRF.
Examples of exempted events of PD may  be:
• Progression of underl ying mali gnancy  (Progressive disease [PD]): if PD is clearl y consistent 
with the suspected progression of the underl ying malignancy  as defined by [CONTACT_688668]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/Procedures due solel y to the progression of underl ying malignancy  (PD)
• Clinical symptoms and/or signs of progression (without confirmation by [CONTACT_480110] 
e.g. imaging, clinical measurement): if the symptom can exclusively  be determined to be due 
to the progression of the underl ying malignancy  and does meet the e
xpected pattern of 
progression for the disease under stud y. 
Exempted events are collected and tracked following a protocol -specified monitoring plan. 
Exempted events will be monitored at appropriate intervals by  [CONTACT_40972].
5.3.7 Dose Limiting Tox icities (DLTs)
A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in this study  is defined as an adverse event or laboratory  
abnormality  which 1) is considered related, probably  related or possibl y related to study  drug 
and 2) meets any of the following criteria , unless that toxicity  can be clearl y attributed to cancer 
progression or to another clearl y identified etiology :
CTCAE Grade 3 h ypergly caemia lasting > 48 hours
CTCAE Grade 4 h ypergly caemia
CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis
CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia 
CTCAE Grade 4 hematologic toxicity  lasting longer than 5 day s
CTCAE Grade 4 thrombocy topenia of any duration and Grade 3 thrombocy topenia 
associated with bleeding
AST or ALT > 5x ULN (for baseline AST/ALT ≤ ULN) or > (baseline value + 4x ULN) 
(for baseline AST/ALT > UL N)

For the purposes of dose finding, onl y DLT events that occur during the first treatment period 
of 28 day s will be considered. Decisions regarding dose escalation/de -escalation steps will be 
made only  after discussion between the sponsor and the investigators, and in consideration of 
all the available safet y information. Available data of DLTs occurring after first treatment 
course and all unusual/unexpec ted AE at an y time during treatment will be considered for the 
purpose of recommending the dose for cohorts B, C, D (dose finding) , E, F , D1 and D2. 
All DL T events that meet AESI  criteria need to be reported immediatel y to the sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , and documented in the eCRF. 
5.[ADDRESS_934216] 2021, samples for PK are no longer collected for ongoing patients.
PK samples will be collected from all patients in this trial at the time points specified in the 
Flow Chart and in Appendix 10.2 (minimal deviations in the time scheduled will not be 
considered as protocol violation) .The actual sampling date and time for blood samples will be 
reported in the eCRF and will be used for determination of PK parameters. To allow a valid 
PK analysis, it is of utmost importance to document the exact clock time of trial medication 
administration and blood sample collection. Any occurrence of vomiting should be 
documented as well. The duration of the xentuzumab infusion will be reported with a start and 
end time in the eCRF. Every  attempt should be made to adhere to an infusion time of 
approximately  1 h for xentuzumab with a constant infusion rate.
At days of PK sampling of abemaciclib (cohorts E, F, D1andD2) patients should be instructed 
to take their morning dose of abemaciclib in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (and not at home as usual). This is 
necessary  in order to allow for a valid PK sampling schedule. For details of the PK sampling 
schedule, please refer to Appendix 10.2.
PK parameters will be evalu ated according to Section 5.1.3 . Non- compartmental PK anal ysis 
will be done in order to calculate PK parameters ( Section 5.1.3) using Phoenix WinNonlin (or 
other validated software) according to BI SOP 001-MCS -36-472 (current version).

No formal analy sis of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic relationship is planned.
Correlation between drug concentration and an y type of response may  be made if appropriate.
Data may  also be used to develop pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic models using nonlinear 
mixed effect modelling techniques, if feasible. For this purpose data may also be combined 
with those from other trials. Modelling activities will be planned and documented separatel y.
5.5 ASSESSMENT OF BIOMAR KER(S) 
As of [ADDRESS_934220] es for biomarkers are no longer collected for ongoing 
patients.
In this clinical study  explorative biomarkers will be measured and analysed. These analyses 
are h ypothesis generating and will be used to expand our understanding of the study  drug and 
the di sease. Participation in the biomarker anal yses is mandatory  for patients from all cohorts. 
Evaluation of molecular and biochemical biomarkers in tumour tissue:
Tumour tissue samples will be collected from all patients (except when there is no tumour 
tissue sample available) to explore the potential influence of molecular and biochemical 
alterations within the tumour on treatment response and outcome. No biopsies should be done 
for the only purpose of obtaining tumour tissue for this trial. Tumour tissue samples will be 
analysed for:
Mutations and copy  number alterations in genes related to the study  drugs and involved 
in tumourigenesis, such as genes of the IGF, PI 3K/mTOR, Ras/MAPK, Rb and related 
signalling pathway s (e.g. IGF1R, PIK3CA, PTEN, KRAS, MYC, CCND1, CDK4, 
CDK6, RB1 and CDKN2A)
RNA expression of IGF, PI3K/mTOR, Ras/MAPK and cell cycle-related signalling 
pathway s (e.g. IGF1, IGF2, IGFBP -family  genes, MYC, CCND1, CDK4, CDK6)
Expression of Rb and p16 proteins via biochemical methods (e.g. IHC). According to 
additional knowledge gained from other studies with xentuzumab and/or abemaciclib
broader analysis of the samples (including immunohistochemistry /in-situ 
hybridization/sequencing of e.g. IGF
-1/2, PTEN, pAKT, pS6, Ki67) might be 
conducted to e.g. address predictive biomarkers, exceptional response or resistance 
mechanisms.
Individual analyses from tumour tissue will be prioritized based on availability  of sufficient 
tissue material.
Molecular evaluation in blood:
Three kinds of blood samples will be collected for genomic anal yses from blood and plasma.
One blood sample will be used to isolate genomic DNA, which will be used as a reference 
(normal tissue) to distinguish tumour acquired somatic mutations and will be anal ysed for the 
indicated panel of genes as in the tumour tissue and/or in the cfDNA (seeabove).

Thirdly , blood samples will be collected and used to evaluate exosomal RNA from plasma. 
Subsequent analy ses of plasma exosomal RNA using standard molecular technology  will 
include, but not be limited to, cell cycle and proliferation related genes, e.g. CCND1, Ki67, 
RB1, CDK4, CDK6 and CDKN2A.
Methods of sample collection
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue, preferabl y FFPE blocks, from the 
most recent time point before entering the stud y will be collected during screening or at a later 
timepoint (see Flow Chart ,Table 5.5: 1and Table 5.5: 2and Appendix 10.3). The FFPE blocks 
will be used to prepare 25 slides at 5µm thickness. Alternatively , 25 freshly  prepared slides at 
5µm thickness from FFPE block can be provided but need to be prepared under RNase -free 
conditions. Isolated nucleic acids (e.g. DNA and RNA) from the tumour tissue will be analysed 
for genomic alterations such as somatic mutations and copy  number alterations as well as RNA 
expression levels as described above.
In addition, patients will be asked for three kinds of blood sa mples:
One blood sample will be collected at C1V1 before treatment (see Flow Chart and Table 5.5: 
1and Table 5.5: 2). The isolated DNA will be analy sed for genomic alterations in a panel of 
cancer -related genes as mentioned for the tissue and/or the cfDNA above serving as a reference 
to allow distinction of tumour- acquired somatic mutations from normal tissue.
For an alysis of circulating nucleic acids, blood samples will be collected in plasma preparation 
tubes at each indicated time point before treatment (Run- in and/or C1V1), at C3V1 and at 
EOTV (see Flow Chart and Table 5.5: 1 and Table 5.5: 2 ). The samples will be used to isolate 
and anal yse circulating nucleic acids as described above.
For exosomal RNA anal yses, blood samples will be collected in EDTA tubes at each indica ted 
time point before treatment is administered to patient (where applicable): At Run-in and/or 
C1V1, atC1V3 (Day  15), at C2V1, at C3V1, at C4V1 onwards and at the EOTV, (see Flow 
Chart and Table5.5: 1and Table 5.5: 2). Separation of the plasma from the remaining blood 
should be performed. The samples will be used to isolate circulating exosomes and analyse 
exosomal components such as e.g. RNA.

be provided in the lab manual.
The biomarker analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_688669] a central l aboratory 
authorized by  [CONTACT_160079] I ngelheim.
Protein biomarkers from blood:
The following protein biomarkers are planned to be examined in this trial:
Free and total IGF-1 in serum (and optionall y free and total IGF-2, dissociable IGF-1 
and IGF -2, and total IGFBP - 3)
Phosphory lated and total IGF- 1R protein in platelet -rich plasma 
Serial collection of blood samples for the assessment of these markers is mandatory . As 
medical knowledge in this field is constantl y evolving, other tissue/blood biomarkers that come 
to be known as potentially  relevant prognostic/predictive markers of treatment response may 
also be explored via available tissues/blood or acquisition of additional tumour tissues/blood. 
Biomarkers that come to be known or emerge as not relevant during the study  may be 
discontinued.
All samples must be adequately labelled by [CONTACT_327790]. Details about blood sample 
collection, plasma/serum preparation, required tubes, labelling of tubes, storage and shipment 
(frequency  and addresses) will be provided in the ISF (laboratory  manual).
Biomarker assessments in blood samples
Levels of free and total IGF-1 (optionall y IGF-2 and the amount of IGFBP -3) will be relativel y 
quantified in serum using validated immunoassay s. Free IGF-1 (and IGF-2) is defined as the 
fraction of total IGF -1 (and total IGF -2) that can be bound by  [CONTACT_688670]
. Dissociable IGF-1 (and IGF-2) is defined as the fraction of total IGF-1 (and total 
IGF-2) that can be bound by [CONTACT_688671], i.e. more highl y diluted in vitro assay 
conditions. Total IGF-1 (and total IGF-2) is quantified in serum samples after splitting the IGF-
IGF-binding protein complexes and the IGF-xentuzumab immune complexes. Optionally , total 
IGFBP-3 will be relatively  quantified in serum using a validated immunoassay .
For quantification of free and total IGF-1 (and optionally  free and total IGF-2 and IGFBP-3), 
blood will be taken from a forearm vein at those time points specified in the Flow Chart and 
Appendix 10.2 .
Quantification of IGF-2 and IGFBP-3 will be performed if scientificall y justified based on 
results of ongoing clinical studies with xentuzumab (e.g. 1280.4).
Biomarkers in platelet -rich plasma
In platelet rich plasma, the level of phosphory lated and total IGF-1R will be analysed via 
immunoassay  as an exploratory  target engagement biomarker. Based on insights from earlier 
clinical trials with xentuzumab or abemaciclib, the anal ysis of other prot eins involved in IGF, 
insulin and/or cy clin-dependent kinase mediated signalling might be added.

[IP_ADDRESS] DNA Banking
One blood sample will be used for DNA Banking if participation and the separate informed 
consent is agreed upon by [CONTACT_688672]. The DNA B anking sample, derived from 
the original blood sample, will be stored at the sponsor. The stored DNA may retrospectivel y 
be analysed, e.g. to identify  whether there are other genetic factors that could contribute to a 
better therapeutic outcome or a higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_056] -related adverse drug 
reactions.
Note: Participation in the DNA Banking sampling is voluntary  and not a prerequisite for 
participation in the trial. The DNA Banking sample will be stored for up to 30 years after 
separate infor med consent is given in accordance with local ethical and regulatory  
requirements.
A blood sample for DNA banking will be collected in a PAXgene Blood DNA tube preferabl y 
at C1V1 or at Run -in Visit 1 for cohorts with Run -in period (or at a later time) (see Flow Chart
and Table 5.5: 1and Table 5.5: 2) for those patients who signed a separate PGx informed 
consent for DNA Banking.
5.6 OTHER ASSESSMENTS
The following patient demographic, baseline characteristics and medical history  will be
collected on the eCRF:
1.General demograph y including sex, birth date and race as allowed b y local law, 
information on smoking and alcohol history . Collection of race and/or ethnic informa tion 
is necessary  in this study  because this is a multi -national trial and race and/or ethnicity  are 
known to be associated with biology  and outcome of breast cancer and NSCL C. Foreign 
regulatory  agencies may  request data or anal ysis based on race/ethnic i nformation.

patients.
For the determination of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against xentuzumab , blood samples will 
be taken from a forearm vein in an EDTA anticoagulant blood drawing tube at time points 
specified in the Flow Chart and in Appendix 10.2. Details about blood sample collection, 
EDTA plasma preparation, storage and shipment will be provided in a laboratory  manual.
A qualitative screening for anti-drug antibodies against xentuzumab in the plasma samples will 
be performed using a validated immunoassay  with xentuzumab as capture reagent. The assay  
enables the sensitive detection of various types of anti-xentuzumab immunoglobulins. ADA 
samples will be analy sed in a multi -tiered approach (Screening, confirmatory  and Titration) 
where screening positive samples will be confirmed and the confirmed positive samples will 
be tested in titration.
To further characterize the immune response of the ADA, additional analy sis may be conducted 
after the completion of this study . The results will be reported separatel y. For this purpose 
samples will be stored beyond end of study  for a maximum period of 5years or until 
termination of the development project, whichever occurs first.
A detailed description of the assay  will be available prior to the start of sample anal ysis.

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This trial will be performed as an open -label study. The primary  objective of the dose finding 
cohorts of this trial is to determine the MTD and the RP2D of:
*Cohort A: xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib (without endocrine background 
therap y)
*Cohort B: xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib on a background therapy  of 
letrozole
*Cohort C: xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib on a background therapy  of 
anastrozole
*Cohort D(dose finding) : xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib on a background 
therap y of fulvestrant
To determine the MTD, patients are entered sequentially into escalating or de -escalating dose -
level cohorts. For each treatment combination, the dose finding will be guided by a Bayesian 
5-parameter logistic regression model with overdose control ( R15- 4233 , Chapter 6 ).
This logistic regression model is defined as follows. Let π1,d1 be the probability  of having a 
DLT when giving dose d 1 of xentuzumab as monotherap y, and π 2,d2 the probability of having a 
DLT when giving dose d2 of the combination partner abemaciclib as monotherapy , 
respectivel y. A logistic regression is used to model the dose-toxicity  relationship for each of 
these drugs individually :
Xentuzumab: logit( π1,d1) =log( α1) + β1log(d 1/d1*)
Abemaciclib: logit( π2,d2) =log( α2) + β2log(d 2/d2*)
Here, the doses d 1* = 1000 mg i.v. once weekl y and d 2* = 150 mg every  12 hours represent 
the reference doses for xentuzumab and abemaciclib, respectivel y. 
Assuming no toxicity  interaction between the two compounds, the probability  of a DLT when 
giving the combination dose d 1, d2is obtained as 
π012,d1,d2 = π 1,d1+ π 2,d2-
π1,d1π2,d2
with corresponding odds 
odds(π012,d1,d2 )= π012,d1,d2 /(1- π012,d1,d2 ).
In order to account for a potential positive (higher toxicity than expected under independence) 
or negative (lower toxicity  than expected under independe nce) interaction between 
xentuzumab and abemaciclib , a dose -dependent interaction term -∞<η<∞ is introduced in the 
model by  [CONTACT_675369]:
odds(π 12,d1,d2 ) = odds(π012,d1,d2 ) exp(η d 1/d1* d2/d2*)
and π 12,d1,d2 is used in the likelihood
rd1,d2~ Binomial(n d1,d2,π12,d1,d2 )
where r d1,d2denotes the random variable describing the observed number of DL Ts in n d1,d2
patients at the dose combination d 1, d2.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934249]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015Since a Bay esian approach is applied, prior distributions f for each of the parameter vectors 
θ1=(log(α 1),log(β 1)), θ 2=(log(α 2),log(β 2)) and for the interaction term η need to be specified.
The prior distributions for θ kwill be specified as a mixture of two bivariate normal 
distributions, 
f(θk) = a 1,kf1(θk) + a 2,kf2(θk)
with 
a1,k, a2,kthe prior mixture weights (a 1,k+ a2,k= 1), k = 1,2 and
fi(θk) = MVN(µ ik, ∑ik) a bivariate normal distribution with mean vector µ ik and covariance

   ,     ,        
  ,   
Mixture prior distributions have the advantage that they allow for specification of different 
logistic dose -toxicity  curves, therefore making the prior more robust. 
A weakl y informative normal prior distribution will be used for η.
The estimated probabi lity of DLT π 12,d1,d2 at each dose combination d 1, d2from the model 
will be summarized using the following intervals:
*Under dosing: [0.00, 0.16)
*Targeted toxicity: [0.16, 0.33)
*Over dosing: [0.33, 1.00]
The BLRM recommended dose combination for the next cohort is the combination with the 
highest posterior probability  of the DLT rate falling in the target interval [0.16, 0.33) among 
the dose combinations fulfilling the EWOC principle. Per EWOC it should be unlikely  (<25% 
posterior probability ) that the DLTrate at the dose combination will exceed 0.33. However, 
the maximum allowable dose increment for the subsequent cohort will be no more than 100 % 
for each drug.
The MTD may  be considered reached if one of the following criteria is fulfilled:
1.The posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval [0.16 –0.33) of the 
MTD is above 0.50, or
2.At least [ADDRESS_934250] been treated at the MTD.
Prior derivation
To determine the prior distributions for θ 1and θ2, a meta -analy tic predictive (MAP) approach 
will be used. Toxicity  information on xentuzumab and abemaciclib from earlier dose finding 
studies will be incorporated. Exact details on the evaluation of the model using hypothetical 
data scenarios and operating characteristics are provided inthestatistical appendix ; abrief 
description is given here. 
The historical data for xentuzumab and abemaciclib can be found in Table 7.1:1 and

The following steps were used to derive the prior distributions for all parameters:
1. θ 1: 
1. The meta -analytic-predictive prior was derived using the information in 
Table 7.1:1 , allowing for substantial between -trial heterogeneity . This mixture 
component was assigned 90% mixture weight.
2. A second, weakl y-informative component was added with 10% mixture 
weight.
2. θ 2: 
1. The meta -analytic-predictive prior was derived using the information in 
Table 7.1:2 , allowing for moderate between -trial heterogeneity . This mixture 
component was assigned 90% mixture weight.
2. A second, weakl y-informative componen t was added with 10% mixture 
weight.
3. η: based on the a priori assumption of no interaction between the two compounds, a 
normal distribution with mean [ADDRESS_934253] deviation 0.707 was chosen. At the 
starting dose combination, the corresponding 95% prior i nterval covers an up to 4 fold 
increase (or decrease) in the odds of a DLT over no interaction.
The prior distribution is given in Table 7.1: 3 . The corresponding prior probability  of a DLT 
at different dose combinations and the corresponding probabilities of under -dosing, targeted 
dosing and overdosing are shown in Table 7.1: 4 .
As seen in Table 7.1: 4 , the dose combination 1000 mg xentuzumab and 150 mg abemaciclib 
has prior probabilities of overdosing below 25%. Hence, this dose combination fulfils the 
overdose criterion and is therefore suitable starting dose combination.

No per protocol set will be used in the anal ysis. However, important protocol violations will 
be summarised. The TSAP will specify  the important protocol violations in detail.
For the determination of the MTD, only MTD evaluable patients will be considered. For the 
analysis of primary  and secondary  endpoints of the expansion parts and further endpoints of 
dose finding and expansion parts, all patients in the treated set (i.e. patients treated with at least 
one dose of an y trial medication, including hormonal therap y) will be included in the anal ysis. 
Any other anal ysis sets will be defined in the TSAP . 
The anal ysis of the primary  endpoint of the dose finding cohorts (cohorts A, B , Cand D (dose 
finding) respectivel y) will be conducted when “last-patient -last-visit-primary -endpoint -dose-
finding” has been reached (see Section 8 .6).
Primary  analy sis of expansion cohorts (cohort E, F , D1 and D 2) might be done before the end 
of the study .The further details will be described in TSAP.
The results of each dose finding cohorts (A, B, C, and D(dose 
finding) ) and each expansion 
coho rts (E , F, D1 and D 2) will be anal ysed separately .
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
For dose finding cohorts A, B, C, and D (dose finding) :
In order to identify  the MTD, 
the number of patients with DLTs during the MTD evaluation 
period at each dose level will be presented. Patients who discontinue during the first treatment 
course for reasons other than DLT will be excluded from the determination of MTD.
For expansion cohort E:
Objective response will be analysed in terms of objective response rate, defined as the 
proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR (note that no confirmation is 
required for best overall response).
For cohort s D1 and D2:
PFS rate at 18thmonth will be derived using Kaplan Meier method .Cohort D1 for visceral vs.
cohort D2 for non-visceral will be display edseparatel y . The details will be described in the 
TSAP .
For expansion cohort F
DC will be analysed in terms of DC rate , defined as the proportion of patients with best overall 
response of CR, PR, SD lasting for at least 24 weeks or non- CR/non -PD lasting for at leas t24 
weeks .
7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
For dose finding cohorts A, B, C, and D (dose finding) :
There are no secondary  endpoints.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934258]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015For expansion cohorts E, F , D1 and D2:
The secondary  endpoints will be anal ysed descriptively .
Disease control 
for Cohorts D1, D2 and E will be anal ysed in the same way as the primary  
analysis for Cohort F.
Time to objective response can onl y be calculated for patients with an objective response:
Time to objective response [day s] = date of first documented CR or PR – date of first 
treatment administration +1.
Duration of objective response can onl y be calculated for patients with an objective response:
*For patients with disease progression or death:
Dura tion of objective response [day s] = date of outcome –date of first assessment 
indicating objective response +1
*For patients without disease progression or death:
Duration of objective response (censored) [day s] = date of outcome – date of first 
assessment indicating objective response +1
The censoring rules for duration of objective response (i.e. outcome and date of outcome) 
will be described in the TSAP. Only  radiological assessments after first assessment indicating 
objective response should be taken i nto account.
Duration of disease control will be derived as follows:
*For patients with disease progression or death:
Duration of disease control [day s] = date of outcome –date of first treatment 
administration+1
*For patients without disease progression or death:
Duration of disease control (censored) [day s] = date of outcome –date of first treatment 
administration +1
The censoring rules for duration of disease control (i.e. outcome and date of outcome) will be 
described in the TSAP. 
Progression-free survival will be derived as follows:
*For patients with “event” as an outcome for PFS:
PFS [day s] = date of outcome –date of first treatment administration + 1
*For patients with “censored” as an outcome for PFS:
PFS (censored) [day s] = date of outcome –date of first treatment administration + [ADDRESS_934259]  as the primary
analysis for Cohort E.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934260]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug [ZIP_CODE].3.4 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All 
adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period 
(REP), a period of [ADDRESS_934261] period will be considered ‘treatment -emergent’. The residual effect period 
is defined as a period of [ADDRESS_934262] drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -
emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_21648] (MedDRA).
DLTs will be tabulated for each dose level in the dose escalation cohorts . The tabulation will 
be done in two wa ys:
DLTs with onset in the first treatment course, and
All DL Ts regardless of treatment course at onset
The definition of DLT and determination of MTD are defined in Section 5.3.[ADDRESS_934263] to distribution parameters as well

The following anal yses will be presented for the laboratory  tests:
Descriptive statistics at each planned assessment, 
Frequency  of patients with transitions in CTCAE grade from baseline to worst and last 
values during treatment, and 
Frequency  of patient s with possible clinically  significant abnormalities.
Additional more in-depth analy ses of AEs and laboratory  data will be performed as needed and 
detailed in the TSAP.
Vital signs, physical examinations, ECG, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934266]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug [ZIP_CODE].4 INTERIM ANALYSES
No formal interim anal ysis is planned for efficacy .
In the dose finding cohorts A, B, C, and D, the SC and BI study  team will continuously  monitor 
and assess safet y data to ensure patients’ safety , as well as to determine the MTD and/or the 
RP2D of each dose finding cohorts. If considered necessary , as soon as the MTD and/or the 
RP2D of a particular dose finding cohort is determined, an evaluation of the safet y (and 
potentially  efficacy ) aspects will be performed via a snapshot of the database. Results of this 
evaluation will be documented and stored.
Continuous monito ring of safet y data for expansion cohorts E, F
, D1and D2will be done by 
[CONTACT_688673] y team.
Earlier efficacy  analyses than those currently  planned may be performed to support future 
decision making and trial planning. 
7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
In general, missing data will not be imputed and all reasonable efforts will be taken during the 
study  to obtain such data. 
Missing baseline laboratory  values will be imputed by [CONTACT_688674]. 
For partial or missing AE onset and/or end dates, BI internal rules will be applied for 
imputation. 
No other imputations will be performed on missing data although every  effort will be made to 
obtain complete information on all adverse events, with particular emphasis on potentia l DLTs.

Drug concentration -time profiles: Concentration data identified with NOS (no sample), NOR 
(no valid result), NOA (not analysed), BLQ (below the limit of quantification) and NOP (no 
peak detectable) will be ignored and not replace d by [CONTACT_688675] (including the lag 
phase). Descriptive statistics of concentrations at specific time points will be calculated only 
when at least 2/[ADDRESS_934268] concentrations within the validated concentration 
range.
Pharmacokine tic parameters: 
In the non-compartmental analysis, concentration data identified with NOS, NOR and NOA 
will not be considered. BLQ and NOP values in the lag phase will be set to zero. The lag phase 
is defined as the period between time [ADDRESS_934269] 2/3 of the individual parameter 
estimates of a certain parameter are available. Pharmacokinetic parameters which cannot be 
determined will be identified by  "not calculated" (NC).
7.6 RANDOMISATION
No randomisation will be performed. In the dose finding cohorts, patients will be assigned 
sequentially  to the dose escal ation groups. In the expansion cohorts, patients will be assigned 
to a cohort based upon previous MTD/RP2D. Medication numbers will be allocated b y an IRT 
system.
7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
No formal statistical power calculations to determine sample size were performed for this 
study . Approximately  148patients (including patients at MTD) will be expected for this trial 
based on the number of dose levels/cohorts that are tested. Fewer or more patients might be 
needed based on the recommendation of the SC and BI Trial Team and the criteria specified
(see Section 7.1 ). 
Dose finding cohorts A, B, C and D:
Approximately  12 patients in cohorts A, B , Cand D(dose finding) will be needed to define a 
MTD. In total, approximately  48 patients will be needed for the dose finding cohorts. However, 
the actual number of patients will depend on the number of dose levels tested. 
Based on the simulation study  to evaluate operating characteristics of the BLRM (see Appendix 
10.6), approximately  12 patients (in mean) are expected to be treated in the dose finding cohort 
A for the model to have reasonable operating characteristics relating to its MTD 
recommendation (see Appendix 10.6 ).
Considering the toxicity  profile of individual compounds, we can assume the same number of 
patients will be needed in the dose finding cohorts B, C and D (dose finding) .

Inexpansion cohort E, 20 patients will be treated at the MTD/RP2D.
Assuming a true objective response (OR) rate of 60%, a sample size of 20 patients leads to a 
probability  of 87% of observing at least 10 ORs. If the true OR rate is higher, i.e. 80%, the 
probability  of observing at least 10 ORs is higher than 99%. The probability to observe a false 
positive signal, i.e. to observe at least 8 ORs if the underlying true OR rate is 20%, is only  3%. 
Table 7.7: 1summarizes the probabil ities of observing certain OR rates based on different 
assumptions on underlying OR rates.

An OR rate of 60% would be considered clinically  relevant in NSCL C patients (cohort E) .
These assumed OR rates and the expected ORs are according to the current knowledge and 
expectations regarding xentuzumab and its combination partners. The calculations were 
performed using R version 3.2.2.
Expansion c ohorts D 1 and D2:
For each of cohort , D1 for visceral metastasis and D2 for non-visceral metastasis , 30 patients 
will be recruited respectively and treated at the RP2D 4. 
For cohort D1, assuming a true PFS rate of 60% at 18thmonth , 10 months recruitment period
and 20% patient drop rate, a sample size of 30
patients leads to a probability  of 62% of
observing at least 57% PFS rate at 18thmonth . If the true PFS rate is higher, i.e. 63%, the 
probability  of observing at least 57% PFS rateis higher than 73%.Theprobability  to observe

An PFS rate of 60% would be considered clinically relevant in each cohorts: visceral metastasis 
and non- visceral metastasis.
These assumed PFS rates and the expected PFS rates are based onthe current knowledge and

Assuming a true DC rate of 60%, a sample size of 20 patients leads to a probability  of 87% of 
observing at least 10 events. If the true DCrate is higher, i.e. 80%, the probability  of observing 
at least 10 events is higher than 99%. The probability  to observe a false positive signal, i.e. to

The start of the trial is defined as the date of the enrolment (screening) of the first patient in 
the whole trial.
Theend of the trial is defined as the date when the last patient in the whole trial completes the 
trial as per definition of trial completion in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The “last -patient -last-visit-primary- endpoint -dose -finding” is defined as the date when all 
patients in a respective dose finding cohort have completed at least the first treatment course. 
Thus, this milestone is defined for each dose finding cohorts (A, B, C and D (dose finding) ).
The “last -patient -last-visit-primary- endpoint -expansion” (Cohorts E and F )is defined as 
the date when all p atients in a respective expansion cohort have completed at least two tumour 
assessment time points or have permanently  discontinued treatment or have completed the trial 
according to Section 6.2.3. Thus, this milestone is defined for each expansion cohorts (Eand
F).
The “last -patient -last-visit-primary- endpoint -expansion” (Cohort s D1 andD2) is defined 
as the date when all patients have completed [ADDRESS_934284] completed 
the trial according to Section 6.2.3. Thus, this 
milestone is defined for Cohorts D 1 and D2 .
The “Last Patient Drug Discontinuation” (LPDD) date is defined as the date on which the 
last patient at an individual trial site ends trial medication (as scheduled per protocol or 
prematurel y). Individual Investigators will be notified of S[LOCATION_003]Rs occurring with the trial 
medication until [ADDRESS_934285].
The IEC / competent authority  in each participating EU member state will be notified about 
the trial milestones according to the respective laws.
A final report of the clinical trial data will be written only after all patients have completed the 
trial in all countries (EU or non- EU) to incorporate and consider all data in the report.
The sponsor will submit to the EU database a summary of the final trial results within one year 
from the end of a clinical trial as a whole, regardless of the country  of the last patient (EU or 
non-EU).
For Japan only : when the trial is completed, the Investigator should inform the head of the trial 
site of the completion in writing, and the head of the trial site should promptly  inform the I RB 
and sponsor of the completion in writing.

Response criteria for target lesions
1.   Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any  pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have a 
reduction in short axis to <10mm)
2.   Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of 
target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters
3.   Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of 
targe t lesions, taking as references the smallest sum on 
study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study ). In addition to the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5mm (note: the appearan ce of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progression).
4.   Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify  for PD, taking as 
references the smallest sum diameters while on study
Response criteria for non -target lesions
1.   Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumour marker level. All ly mph nodes 
must be non- pathological in size (<10mm short axis)
2.   Non- CR/ Non- PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and 
maintenance of tumour marker level above the normal 
limits
3.   Progression (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions

10.5.1 Introduction
Alterations of liver parameters, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Protocol -Specified Adverse 
events of special interest), are to be further evaluated using the following procedures:
10.5.2 Procedures
Any elevation of ALT/AST and bilirubin qualify ing as laboratory  alert should be confirmed 
using t he initial sample if possible.
If the alert is confirmed on initial sample, or it is not possible to repeat testing using initial 
sample, the following must be completed:
1) Evaluate patient within 48 hours and
2) Perform the following laboratory  tests: 
1. Repeat of AST, ALT, bilirubin (with fractionation to total and direct) 
2.Haptoglobin
3.Complete blood count and cell morphology
4.Reticulocy te count
5.Creatine Kinase (CK)
6.Lactate deh ydrogenase (LDH)
7.Alkaline Phosphatase
The results of these 
laboratory  tests must be reported to BI as soon as possible.
If the initial alert values (i.e. AST,ALT, and bilirubin) are confirmed on the second sample 
described as above, then an abdominal ultrasound or clinically  appropriate alternate imaging  
(to rule out biliary  tract, pancreatic or intrahepatic pathology , e.g. bile duct stones or neoplasm) 
must be completed within 48 hours. 
The findings from the hepatic imaging (including comparison to prior imaging if available) 
must be made available as soon as possible as part of the adverse event reporting process. In 
the event the etiology  of the abnormal liver tests results is not identified based on the imaging 
(e.g. biliary  tract, pancreatic or intrahepatic pathology ), then the “DILI checklist” must be 
completed.  Details of the “DILI checklist” are provided in the ISF.  The following assessments 
need to be performed in order to complete the “DILI checklist” and results will be reported via 
the eCRF:
obtain a detailed history  of current symptoms and concurr ent diagnoses and medical history  
according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the ISF;
obtain history  of concomitant drug use (including non-prescription medications, herbal and 
dietary  supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets 
according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the ISF;
obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents (consider home and work place 
exposure) according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF;
complete the following labora tory tests as detailed in the DILI checklist provided in the I SF:

10.6 STATISTICAL APPENDIX
A Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control will be used to guide dose 
escalation/ de-escalation in cohorts A, B, C and D(dose finding) . The BLRM is introduced in 
Section 7.1 , which also specifies the prior for the model in cohort A. The priors for other dose 
finding cohorts (B, C and D (dose finding) ) will be documented in the TSAP. After patients in 
each dose group have completed at least one course of treatment, the prior distributions will be 
updated through Gibbs sampling procedures with the accumulated DLT data from the MTD 
evaluati on period. Posterior probabilities for the rate of DLT will be summarised from BLRM. 
Selection of the next dose combinations will be based on these probabilities as well as on other 
safet y and laboratory data. 
The purpose of this statistical appendix is to present performance metrics (operating  
characteristics) that illustrate the precision of the design in estimating the MTD under various 
dose-toxicity  relationships through computer simulation. These results are summarized in 
Table 10.6: 3 . In addition, recommendations of the next dose combination by  [CONTACT_688681] 04Mar 2022

1). 
Hypothetical data scenarios
Hypothetical data scenarios are shown in Table 10.6: 1. These scenarios reflect potential on-
study  data constellations and related escalation as allowed by [CONTACT_10994]. For each scenario, the 
probability  of target dose and overdose for the current dose combination, as well as the next 
potential dose combination and related probabilities of under -dosing, target dose, and over -
dosing are shown.
Forexample, scenario 1 shows the example, that at the starting dose combination 150 mg 
abemaciclib and 1000 mg xentuzumab none of 3 patients experiences a DLT. Then, the BLRM 
allows treating patients atthe same dose 
which is the maximum combination dose allows by 
[CONTACT_760] . 
Scenario 4 shows the example, that at the starting dose combination 150 mg abemaciclib and 
1000 mg xentuzumab none of 6 patients experiences a DLT. Therefore, the MTD in this case 
would be the combination of 150 mg / 1000 mg. 
Scena rio 6shows the example that at the starting dose combination 150 mg abemaciclib and 
1000 mg xentuzumab 2 out of 3 patients experiences a DLT, then none of 3 patients treated at 
100 mg / 1000 mg experiences a DLT. The overdose control of the BLRM suggests escalating 
to 150mg / 750 mg.
All these scenarios illustrate the adaptive behaviour of the model even in extreme situations.

* Recommended dose combination is the dose combination with the highest target probability. Note that other combinations 
have similar target toxicity probabilities.
Operating characteristics
Operating characteristics are a way to assess the long -run behaviour of a model by [CONTACT_688682]. Under an assumed true dose -toxicity curve, 
metrics such as the probability of recommending a dose combination with true DLT rate in the 
target interval can be approximated via simulation. 
Table 10.6: [ADDRESS_934327] a wide range of possible cases 
as follows:
*Scenario 1: aligned with prior means
*Scenario 2: high -toxicity  scenario
*Scenario 3: low -toxicity  scenario
*Scenario 4: low -high-toxicity  scenario

For each of these scenarios, 1000 trials were simulated. Each cohort consisted of 3 patients 
and dose escalation complied with the following rule:

toxicity  region and satisfies the overdose criterion

which the posterior probability  of targeted toxicity  was at least 50%. Or if in total [ADDRESS_934330] been evaluated at a dose combination which is the model’s recommendation for the next 
dose-level cohort.
It was then assessed how often a dose combination was declared as MTD with true DLT rate 
in the under -, targeted or over -dose range.
Furthermore, the average, minimum and maximum number of patients per trial and the 
average number of DLTs per trial are reported. Results are shown in Table 10.6: 3 below.

In scenario 1, which reflects the case that the true dose- toxicity  is aligned with prior means, 
almost all of the simulated trials (54%) that have found a MTD declared the MTD with true 
toxicity  rate in the target interval. Few simulated trials (
2.0%) have been stopped before 
declaring a MTD. None of trials declared a MTD with true DLT rate in the overdose interval. 
In scenario 2 ( high-toxicity  scenario) 68% of the simulated trials that have found a MTD 
declared the MTD with true toxicity  rate in the target interval and 23% declared a MTD with 
true DLT rate in the overdose interval. Few simulated trials (8%) have been stopped before
declaring a MTD.
Scenario 3 (low -toxicity  scenario) illustrates a behaviour similar to scenario 1.
Scenario 4, a mixture of the high toxicity  and the low toxicity  scenario, shows characteristics 
of both of these.
The mean patient numbers range from 10.68 patients (Scenario 2) to 12.10 patients (Scenario 
4) and the maximum number of patients was 21. Therefore, the patient numbers are as 
expected.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_934331]-03(13.0)/Saved on: 05 Aug 2015By [CONTACT_688683], it can be seen that the model is not sensitive to different 
scenarios of truth. In general, this model is conservative due to the overdose control criteria. 
In all scenarios, the probabilities of recommending a dose combination with true P(DLT) ≥ 
33% as MTD are much smaller than probabilities of recommending a dose combinat ion with 
true P(DLT) between 16% and 33% as MTD.
On-study  recommendations based on the model are consistent with the clinical decision 
making process, and should be considered in conjunction with other available clinical 
information by  [CONTACT_688684].

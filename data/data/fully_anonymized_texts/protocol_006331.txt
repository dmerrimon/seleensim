Study Overview 
This study will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_462879] (AML) or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
for those ages >18 years of age. 
1. Objectives 
Assess the feasibility of outpatient induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or 
advanced (MDS) by [CONTACT_462894]: 
1.) >50% of patients treated as outpatients can complete chemotherapy without being 
admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
2.) <5% of patients die within [ADDRESS_592660] 20 years has tried to curb health care costs by [CONTACT_462895]. An example of this would be the establishing of "day surgical procedure units". 
Little focus has been on the "outlier healthcare consumer", those patients that make up a 
fraction of the population, but disproportionately consume resources I. Those patients can 
drive up healthcare cost with a rare, life threatening disease. 
Little research has been done to look at the health care economics of acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML). Commonly today, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is treated with induction and 
consolidation chemotherapy in an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Feasibility of outpatient 
consolidation chemotherapy has been examined 2, but induction chemotherapy to induce 
remission in an outpatient setting has not been done. 
Research has shown that it is not the LOS (length of stay) fueling the cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124021], but front loaded costs; the cost that occur during the "early stage of admission 
when resource consumption is most intense" 3. We have already shown that patients can be 
safely early discharged once induction therapy is complete. This can be done without an 
increase in "treatment-related mortality" (TRM) provided the patients are doing well at 
discharge, live in proximity to UW/SCCA, have an outpatient caregiver, and are committed 
to return for outpatient follow-up 4. While we have not quantified the effects of early 
discharge on cost or quality-of-life, it seems likely that these effects are favorable. We have 
also shown that, regardless of neutrophil count, patients can be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462880] "neutropenic fever" without increase in mortality or admission 
to the ICU 5. We have addressed patient safety and early discharge and now want to look one 
step further. We want to go beyond cost containment of early stage hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462881] a look at the feasibility of moving induction chemotherapy for AML patients to an 
outpatient treatment setting. 
This protocol is an extension of our early discharge experience. Specifically it will examine 
the feasibility of administering to selected outpatients an induction chemotherapy regimen 
that would usually be administered to inpatients, as will still be the case for most patients. 
Although administration of the regimen requires only 4-[ADDRESS_592661] 
savings per patient multiplied by [CONTACT_462896] a patients' quality-of-life.

We will use 2 criteria to assess "feasibility". The first is whether an excessively high 
proportion of patients need to be admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462882], infection etc. The need to admit a high 
proportion of patients would at the very least increase work required by [CONTACT_39487]. Our 
unpublished experience with outpatient induction is that 15% of a series of 13 patients with 
relapse were admitted prior to completion of therapy. We propose these data as our historical 
control, but any specific number will be arbitrary. Certainly the relevance and utility of 
outpatient therapy would be in doubt were the proportion much above 50%, so we have 
chosen this number. The 2" d  and more important criterion is TRM attributable to 
administration of typi[INVESTIGATOR_462883]. "Attributable" is also 
somewhat nebulous but TRM within 14 days of beginning chemotherapy seems reasonable. 
Current TRM rates for patients receiving chemotherapy as inpatients are <5% 6. Hence it 
would require many patients given chemotherapy as outpatients to be confident that the 
outpatient TRM rate is similarly low. Such hypothesis testing is not our intent. We merely 
intend to enter a maximum of 25 patients stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_462884] 2 
criteria for feasibility will not be met. Our statistical section (see section 7.0) provides the 
rationale supporting our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], briefly stated that the study if [ADDRESS_592662] been selected to minimize the chance of TRM and, probably, 
the need for admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462885]. 
3.1. Inclusion Criteria 
1.) Signed Written Informed Consent a.) 
The signed informed consent. 
b.) The benefits / risks of the induction chemotherapy regimen will be reviewed, and a 
second consent may be necessary if the regimen will be administered according to a 
separate protocol. 
2.) AML (APL excepted) or high-risk MDS (10-19% blasts in marrow by [CONTACT_462897]). 
3.) Meet the eligibility criteria for the selected inpatient protocol that they will receive as an 
outpatient. 
To receive the treatment as an outpatient they must: 
a.) Treatment-related mortality (TRM) score (ref) <9.21 corresponding to a TRM rate 
of 3% when chemotherapy of similar intensity as proposed here is administered to 
inpatients. 
b.) Ages >18 years of age 
c.) Blast count < 10,000 
d.) Fibrinogen > 200 
e.) Afebrile with clear chest imaging and no signs of active viral, bacterial, fungal 
infection unless determined to be, at the discretion of the investigator, not clinically 
significant in the context of this study. 
f.) Adequate cardiac function as demonstrated by [CONTACT_462898] 45% or greater, by 
[CONTACT_258071]. No ongoing cardiac issues such as uncontrolled 
arrhythmias or unstable angina or congestive heart failure. 
g.) Patient must have an outpatient caregiver available. 
5 of 12 
7910 
h.) Patient must live within 30 minutes of the treating physician's office during 
outpatient treatment. 
i.) Patient must be willing to return to the treating physician's office for outpatient 
follow-up once outpatient treatment is completed. 
j.) Logistical requirements: 
1. Space available in infusion room. 
2. Outpatient infusion pump available if continuous infusion required. 
3. Case discussed with infusion room nursing staff. 
Note: age and white blood count are already components of the TRM score, but are included 
here for safety purposes 
4. Treatment Plan 
1.) Patients will be treated according to the operative inpatient induction chemotherapy 
regimen for which they will also provide informed consent. 
2.) Treatment must begin on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday after 
discussion with the 5th  floor Infusion Room staff 
3.) If treatment includes ara-C at a daily dose of? 1g/m2 patients will receive steroid eye 
drops and prednisone 100 mg daily or its IV equivalent. 
4.) Patients must be followed daily during administration of chemotherapy. Evaluation will 
be until completion of chemotherapy. 
Evaluation will include: 
a.) Daily weight 
b.) Daily CBC and platelet count (ordered as "52D"), chemistries (ordered as S9), 
and uric acid, LDH, Mg, phosphate 
5.) Change in weight of +/- 1.5 kg , hematocrit <24, platelet count < 10, sodium < 130 or > 
145, potassium <3.2 or > 4.8, fever, or development of fever will mandate a call to the 
patient's mid level provider or attending physician. 
6.) Patient will receive prophylactic oral levofloxacin, fluconazole and acyclovir. 
4.1. Indications for Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462878] 
1.) Fever (?_101.0 F) 
2.) Infection requiring IV antibiotics. 
3.) Shortness of breath not promptly responsive to red cell transfusion and/or associated with 
new infiltrate on chest X-ray.

nausea/vomiting controlled by [CONTACT_15923], asymptomatic metabolic abnormalities, or skin 
rash, diarrhea of volume unable to be compensated by [CONTACT_462900], pain not controlled 
by [CONTACT_271493]. 
4.2. Mechanism For Care "After Hours" Patients will proceed directly to the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
[ADDRESS_592663] of care for patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for AML or advanced MDS.

6. Regulatory and Reporting Requirements 
6.1. Adverse Event Monitoring and Reporting 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_462887]. This protocol will not dictate the choice of chemotherapy regimens. The sole 
research focus of this study is the feasibility of using an outpatient setting for administration 
of chemotherapy for AML or advanced MDS. For purposes of this study, only the following 
AEs will be recorded: 
1.) Reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462888]. 
2.) Causes of any deaths that occur within 14 days of start of outpatient chemotherapy 
(expedited reports). 
[ADDRESS_592664] annually by [CONTACT_462901] (PDMC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The PDMC reviews accrual, 
adverse events, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], and adherence to the data and safety monitoring plan. The 
PHCRC IRB reviews the study progress and safety information to assess continued 
acceptability of the risk-benefit ratio for human subjects. Approval of both committees is 
necessary to continue the study. 
7. Statistical Considerations 
A maximum of 25 patients will be entered. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_462889] 2 
circumstances: 
1.) Excess probability that patients have to be admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371891] 4-7 days of 
outpatient chemotherapy. 
2.) Excess probability that patients die during the 14 days after beginning outpatient 
treatment. 
For both 1 and 2 the case for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_462890] "predictive 
probabilities" freely available from the Statistics Department at MD Anderson Cancer Center 
(https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/softwaredownload/) . In particular stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_462891][ni> n ij] > 0.90 where Pr= probability, ni is 
the posterior probability for rate of admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462892]. We will assume that it is 
distributed 13(a ,b] where "a" is the number of successes (no admission) and "b" the number 
of failures (admission) with management approach i (current) or management approach j 
(previous). We will assume a prior of 13[25,25] for the previous approach corresponding to a 
50% need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462893] 50 patients and a prior 
of13(5,1) with the current approach corresponding to our data indicating that [ADDRESS_592665] 
been treated as outpatients without need for inpatient admission while 1 has been admitted. 
As patients up to a maximum of 25 are entered on the current approach its prior will be 
updated and compared to the 13[25,25] distribution using the inequality probability 0.90 noted 
above. With this configuration here are the predictive probabilities that the current approach 
(called A) is truly better than the previous approach 13[25,25] denoted B given various 
numbers of successes (no admission during days 4-7) and failures (admission).

1 5 0.12 . 
2 6 0.09 
3 6 0.15

We would stop accrual should the predictive probability be < 0.10, for example in the 3 
success / [ADDRESS_592666] 
been admitted contrasted with the maximum acceptable rate of 4 admitted / 6 not. 
For the death within 14 days endpoint our prior for the current (inpatient) approach will be 
[3[49, 1] corresponding to a 2% (1/50) death rate and will be f3[5, 0] for the outpatient 
approach, corresponding to [ADDRESS_592667] met eligibility criteria 
for the proposed protocol. These data will be updated as patients (up to the maximum of 25) 
are enrolled and the resultant beta distribution compared to the [3[49, 1] distribution noted 
above, using the inequality probability 0.9 noted in the section on admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
With this configuration here are the predictive probabilities that the current approach (called 
A) is truly worse than the previous approach 13[49,  1] denoted B given various numbers of 
successes (no deaths days 1- 14) and failures (deaths days 1- 14).

We would stop accrual should the predictive probability be > 0.90, for example in cases 
where there are 2 failures and < [ADDRESS_592668] Drivers. National Institute of Health

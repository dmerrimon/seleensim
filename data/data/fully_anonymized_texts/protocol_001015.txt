Title of Study :  A long-term  extension trial of  the Phase III lipid-l owering trials to assess the effect of long-term 
dosing of inclisiran given as subcutaneous injections in subjects with high cardiovascular risk and elevated LDL-C 
(ORION -8 also referred to as CKJX839A12306 B) 
Phase of Development : III 
Study Centers : Global Multicenter study (approximately 300 sites).  
Central Facilities :  This list is maintained by [CONTACT_76605] : Maximum of up to 3300 subjects  
Study Period : The estimated study period for the study will be approximately [ADDRESS_83175] completed, or until the investigator's recommendation of discontinuation, 
sponsor's recommendation of discontinuation, until an administrative decision is made to end the study . 
Objectives:   
Primary :  
The primary objective s are to evaluate:  
• The effect of inclisiran treatment on the proportion of subjects achieving prespecified low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol ( LDL-C) targets  at end of study ( EOS )   
• The safety and tolerability profile of long-term use of inclisiran  
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of inclisiran on:  
• LDL-C levels  
• Other lipi[INVESTIGATOR_76566] :  
This study will be a long-term extension study  in up to 33 00 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD), ASCVD-risk equivalents (eg, diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) , or heterozygous  
 familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH  ) and elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-
C) despi[INVESTIGATOR_76567]-C lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76568] -PCS -16-01 
(ORION -3, also referred to as CKJX839A12201E1) or  Phase III lipid lowering studies : MDCO -PCS -17-03(ORION -
9 also referred to as CKJX839A12303), MDCO -PCS -17-04  (ORION -10, also referred to as CKJX839A12304, or 
MDCO -PCS -17-08(ORION -11, also referred to as CKJX839A12305). The purpose of this extension study is  to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of long-term dosing of inclisiran. Informed consent will be obtained from subjects before the initiation of any study -specific procedures. The EOS visit in the previous study will be Day 
1 in ORION -8.  
Subjects completing one of the previously mentioned inclisiran trials  (the Phase II trial (ORION -3,  Phase III 
inclisiran studies (ORION -9, ORION -10 or  ORION -11 trial) and fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria of this 
study will receive blinded inclisiran sodium 300 milligrams  (mg) which is equivalent to [ADDRESS_83176] 
study medication at day 90.  Subjects who received placebo in the previous  Phase III  feeder study will receive 
blinded inclisiran and subjects who received inclisiran in the previous feeder study will receive blinded placebo at 
this visit , in order to maintain the blinding of the feeder study until database lock of those studies.  For  subjec ts 
enrol led in Sweden, Sweden S pecific Protocol Amendment 1 (to Global Amendment 1 version, dated 1 Nov 2018) 
was implemented to allow limited lab tests to be done on Day [ADDRESS_83177] any safety information during the gap between feeder’s EOS and Day1of this study  until ethics  commit tee approval was granted in that country.  
After first study drug administration, all subjects will be observed in the clinic for [ADDRESS_83178] injection before 
being discharged.  
All subjects will return at Day 90 for the next visit and will receive open label inclisiran sodium 300 mg which is 
equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran . Subjects  will then return for open label drug administration of inclisiran sodium 300 
mg every 180 days until EOS  and be observed for 30 minutes at each visit .  
Efficacy assessments will measure the effects of inclisiran on levels of LDL-C .  
At each visit, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), concomitant medications, and safety 
laboratory parameters will be collected.

1 I ntroduction  
 Inclisiran (also referred to as KJX839) is  a novel synthetic ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference 
(RNAi) therapeutic  used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. This protocol describes a study 
to evaluate the effect of inclisiran  treatment on low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) levels . 
This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_76608] (GCP) including the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
1.1 Background 
1.1.1 Disease Overview  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_76572], cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death  
worldwide, resulting in over 17 million deaths annually ( WHO 2016) . Eighty percent of all  CVD 
deaths are due to coronary heart disease (CHD) or strokes. Elevated LDL -C is a major risk factor 
for the development of CVD ( Grundy et al, 2004; Go et al, 2014) . Lowering LDL -C has been 
shown to reduce the risk of death or heart attack and within the range of effects achieved so far, the clinical risk reduction is linearly proportional to the absolute LDL -C reduction ( Baigent et al 
2005). 
Approximately 100 million people worldwide are treated with lipid lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
predominantly statins, to reduce LDL -C and the associated risk of death nonfatal myocardial 
infarction (MI) and nonfat al stroke or associated events ( Decision Resources Group, 2015) . Yet 
residual risk for cardiovascular (CV) events remains and statins are associated with well -known 
limitations. First, not all patients reach LDL -C levels associated with optimal prot ection against 
clinical events ( Foley et al, 2003; Baigent et al 2005; Davidson et al, 2005; CTT Collaborators et 
al, 2008; Foody et al, 2010) . Second, not all patients tolerate statins or are able to take statins at 
sufficiently intensive doses. And third, observational studies have demonstrated that >50% of patients do not adhere to statin therapy for more than 6 months ( Poluzzi et al, 2008 ; Mann et al, 
2010). 
There  is an unmet need for additional treatment options beyond currently available treatments for 
lowering of the LDL- C level to reduce cardiovascular risk.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_76573], current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76574] -C remain insufficient in some patients ( Jones et al, 2012 ; 
Jameson et al, 2014; Barkas et al 2015; Fitzgerald et al, 2017 ). This is particularly true in patients 
with pre -existing CHD and/or diabetes or a history of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), who are 
at the highest risk and require  the most intensive management ( Davidson et al, 2005 ).  
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a member of the serine protease family, plays a key role in controlling the levels of low -density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR)  on the 
surface of hepatocytes ( Khorova, 2017) . PCSK9 is expressed and secreted into the bloodstream 
predominantly by [CONTACT_4852], binds LDLR both intracellularly and extracellularly and promotes the lysosomal degradation of t hese receptors in hepatocytes, ( Lakoski et al, 2009; Mousavi et al, 2009 ) 
thereby [CONTACT_76609]- C levels. Loss of function mutations in PCSK9 have been 
found to lead to increased LDLR in liver, reduced serum L DL-C, and a lower risk for CHD (Berge 
et al, 2006; Cohen et al, 2006; Kotowski et al, 2006; Zhao et al, 2006) with no apparent  negative 
health consequences. ( Zhao et al, 2006; Hooper et al, 2007 ; Horton et al, 2009).

Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
Recently developed and approved PCSK9- blocking monoclonal antibodies reduce circulating 
PCSK9 levels and lower LDL -C levels. Preliminary reports indicate that treatment with such 
antibodies can lead to reduction of cardiovascular events compared with placebo ( Hooper et al, 
2005; Navarese et al, 2015 ; Robinson et al, 2015; Zhang et al, 2015; Sabatine et al, 2017). Results 
from the first completed large CV outcomes trial (FOURIER) were reported in March 2017. 
Repatha® (evolocumab) significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. The study in approximately 27,000 patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) met its primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76575]) and the key secondary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonf atal MI or nonfatal stroke) ( Sabatine et al, 2017 ).  
The data from PCSK9 blocking antibodies such as Repatha® (evolocumab) and Praluent® (arilocumab) are very encouraging. However, these products are dosed SC every 2 to 4 weeks necessitating up to 26 injections per year ( Hooper et al, 2005; Navarese et al, 2015 ; Zhang et al, 
2015) . In contrast, one injection of i nclisiran is anticipated to be given three times in the first year 
and every 6 months thereafter. 
1.1.2 PCSK9 Biology and Target Rationale 
PCSK9 is a member of the subtilisin serine protease family. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 
type 9 is predominantly expressed by [CONTACT_76610] ( Mousavi et al, 2009) . LDL -C levels in plasma are markedly elevated in humans 
with gain of function mutations in PCSK9, classifying them as having severe familial hypercholest erolemia (Abifadel et al, 2003) . Data from genetic association studies have identified 
loss of function alleles in human PCSK9 that result in lower PCSK9 protein  levels and lower LDL -
C levels ( Zhao et al, 2006; Hooper et al, 2007; Horton et al, 2009). In one published study, 
heterozygous individuals (carrying a single copy of a loss of function PCSK9 mutation) had significantly lower LDL -C with median levels of approx imately 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) ( Cohen 
et al, 2006). Over a 15- year period of retrospective data analysis, this sustained lowering in LDL -
C levels translated to an 88% lower risk of risk for CHD. Follow -up publications describe two 
adult individuals that are compound heterozygous for loss of function alleles of PCSK9. These individuals lack detectable plasma PCSK9 protein, have LDL -C levels ≤20  mg/dL, and yet are 
otherwise healthy ( Zhao et al, 2006 ; Hooper et al, 2007) . Additionally, recent human clinical trials 
with PCSK9 blocking antibodies have shown significant lowering of LDL -C in healthy volunteers 
and across a range of high CV -risk populations and with elevated LDL -C both with and without 
statins ( Banerjee et al, 2012; Dias et al, 2012; Milazzo et al, 2012; Raal et al, 2012 ; Roth et al, 
2012; Stein et al, 2012 ; Sullivan et al, 2012; Hooper et al, 2013). Two monoclonal agents to inhibit 
PCSK9 are currently approved in Europe and North America. Recent cardiovascular outcomes trials have further confirmed that PCSK9 is a validated drug target whose inhibition results in LDL -C lowering and significant outcomes benefit without otherwise negatively impacting overall 
health ( Ridker et al, 2017; Sabatine et al, 2017 ).  
1.1.3 Mechanism of RNA Interference 
Ribonucleic acid interference  (RNAi)  is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism for regulating 
gene expression that is mediated by [CONTACT_76611] (siRNAs). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], synthetic siRNAs are 19 -base to 25 -base pair double -stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 
two- to four-nucleotide overhang at one or both of the 3’  ends. Such siRNAs can be designed to 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 14 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
target an endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene. When introduced into 
cells, the guide (or antisense) strand of the siRNA loads into an enzyme complex called the RNA -
Induced Silencing Complex. This enzyme complex subsequently binds to its complementary mRNA sequence, mediating cleavage of the target mRNA and the suppression of the target protein encoded by [CONTACT_76612] ( Elbashir et al, 2001).  
Since unmodified siRNAs are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_76576] (Soutschek et al, 2004) , various formulations are currently used to 
target their distribution to tissues, and to facilitate uptake of siRNAs into the relevant cell type. One approach that has been used successfully in vivo, in animal models (including in rodents and nonhuman primates) and humans employs intravenous  (IV) delivery of siRNA in lipid 
nanoparticle formulations ( Soutschek et al, 2004; Morrissey et al, 2005; Geisbert et al, 2006; Judge 
et al, 2006; Zimmermann et al, 2006 ; Coelho et al, 2013; Tabernero et al, 2013) . Another approach 
for liver- specific gene silencing is subcutaneously administered siRNA conjugated to a 
N-acetylgalactosamin e (GalNAc) carbohydrate ligand ( Ashwell and Morell, 1974) . Conjugation 
of a triantennary GalNAc ligand to an siRNA enables hepatocyte binding and subsequent cellular uptake via the asialoglycoprotein receptor, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and down regulation of hepatic proteins. Single and multiple doses of subcutaneously administered siRNA- GalNAc conjugates have been used to target transthyretin (TTR) mRNA for the treatment 
of TTR -mediated amyloidosis. ALN -TTRCSC has been found to be generally safe and well 
tolerated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in over 40  healthy volunteers and 18 subjects with 
familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy a nd senile systemic amyloidosis ( ALN- TTRSC -001; 
EudraCT 2012-004203-12; and ALN- TTRSC -002; EudraCT 2013-002856-33).  
1.[ADDRESS_83194] of RNAi by [CONTACT_76613] -induced silencing complex (RISC), enabling it to cleave mRNA 
molecules encoding PCSK9 specifically. The cleaved PCSK9 mRNA is degraded  and thus 
unavailable for protein translation, which results in decreased levels of the PCSK9 protein. A single siRNA -bound RISC is catalytic and cleaves many transcripts and the duration of action is 
anticipated to be longer than other mechanisms.

to receptors on hepatocytes, thereby [CONTACT_76614]. This is highlighted by [CONTACT_76615], inclisiran exposure in other tissues was 36 -fold to 1076- fold lower than liver.

nclisiran was well tolerated in all studies. The most common findings were related to the expected 
pharmacological effects of inclisiran on lipid profiles and histopathological findings of vacuolation in hepatocytes of rats and lymph node macrophages of monkeys and the presence of basophilic granules in hepatocytes of monkeys and kidneys of rats. These microscopic findings are not considered adverse because they are not associated with changes in clinical pathology parameters. Liver function enzymes were o nly minimally to mildly increased, and were reversible following 
treatment-free periods, and there were no changes in urinalysis or urine chemistry parameters.  
Additional non-clinical studies are ongoing or planned. 
1.2.2 Clinical Studies 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical pharmacology 
Inclisiran is inactive in plasma and acts directly in the hepatocytes leading to inhibition of PCSK9 
protein synthesis. After SC administration of inclisiran, peak plasma concentrations were observed by 4 hours and became undetectable in plasma in 24 hours to 48  hours with a n elimination terminal 
half- life (t
1/2) of 7.3 hours and dose -proportional increase in exposure parameters of maximum 
plasma concentration (C max) and area under the curve (AUC). There was no accumulation of 
inclisiran plasma concentrations following multiple weekly, biweekly or monthly dosing. Mean fraction excreted unchanged in the urine was around 25%. In vitro studies using hepatic P450 metabol ic enzymes showed that inclisiran neither inhibited nor induced common hepatic metabolic 
pathways.  
In a Phase I study in subjects with renal impairment (ORION-7, also referred  to as 
CKJX839A12103) ( Section [IP_ADDRESS].4), a single 300 mg SC dose of inclisiran sodium  which is 
equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran  was observed to increase C
max and AUC up to approximately two-
fold in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment, and increased C max up to four -fold and 
AUC up to three -fold in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal 
renal function. However, by 48 hours plasma levels of inclisiran were below the level of 
quantification in all groups.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_76577] (PK) parameters over the first [ADDRESS_83196] to PCSK9 reduction and LDL -C reduction. In addition, there was no difference in the 
overall safety profile between subjects with normal renal function and those with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.  
This finding is consistent with that observed in the previous Phase I (ALN -PCSSC -001, also 
referred  to as 
CKJX839A12101. ) study ( Section [IP_ADDRESS].1) where doses above 300 mg, which is 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 16 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran,  led to a dose related increase in PK parameters. A single 500 mg 
dose increased AUC two to three fold and Cmax four to five  fold compared to a single 300 mg 
dose, which is similar to the increase observed in subjects with severe renal impairment compared 
to those with normal renal function in this study. In both the Phase I (ALN -PCSSC -001) and Phase 
II (ORION -1 also referred to as CKJX839A12201) studies single doses above 300 mg did not lead 
to greater reductions in PCSK9 or LDL -C levels over time or differences in the safety profile.  
These data support the administration of inclisiran to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment in future and ongoing clinical studies with inclisiran.  
Additional clinical pharmacology studies are ongoing or planned. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical  
Results are presented from four clinical studies: 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_83197] -PCSSC- 001 (also referred  to as CKJX839A12101)  
ALN- PCSSC -001 ( completed) was a Phase I study in which single (25 mg, 100 mg, 300 mg,  
500 mg and 800 mg) and multiple [125 mg once weekly (four doses), 250 mg every 2 weeks (two 
doses), 300 mg every 4 weeks (two doses) and 500 mg every four weeks (two doses) ] doses of 
inclisiran sodium were evaluated. Subjects in this study were followed until their LDL -C levels 
returned to ≥80% of the baseline value or until [ADDRESS_83198] dose, confirming the extended duration of action of inclisiran. No further 
follow -up occurred beyond this time point in this Phase I study. All adverse events (AEs) were 
mild o r moderate ( Grade 1 or 2) in severity with no differences relative to placebo other than skin 
reactions which were infrequent, mild and reversible following inclisiran.  
The Phase I study demonstrated that the [ADDRESS_83199] dose to achieve near -maximal reductions in PCSK9 and LDL -C 
levels. Two 300 mg doses of inclisiran sodium given 30 days apart achieved an additional 10% 
LDL -C reduction compared to a single 300 mg dose. PK parameters of inclisiran demonstrated a 
short plasma half -life (t
1/2 = ~6 hours) and did not correlate with the observed pharmacodynamic 
(PD) effects of inclisiran.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Study ORION -1 (MDCO- PCS- 15-01 also referred  to as CKJX839A12201  
ORION- 1 (MDCO- PCS-15-01, completed study) was a Phase II, double -blind, randomized, multi -

A total of 501 subjects were randomized to a single dose regimen of placebo, 200 mg inclisiran sodium , or 300 mg inclisiran sodium , 500 mg inclisiran sodium (on Day 1) or a double -dose 
regimen of placebo, 100 mg inclisiran sodium , 200 mg inclisiran sodium , or 300 mg inclisiran  
sodium (on Day 1 and Day 90). 
The [ADDRESS_83200]. The double-dose regimen of 300 mg 
regimen led to reduced LDL-C of 52.6% (LS mean) compared to a 1.8% increase in the placebo

group (p<0.0001) at Day 180. Similarly, this regimen led to reduced PCSK9 of 69.1% (mean) 
compared to a 1.2% decrease in the placebo group at Day 180. At Day 360 (9 months after the 
second 300 mg dose), LDL-C reduction was 33.8%.  
There were no clinically significant safety observations other than mild -moderate, short -lived skin 
reactions at the injection site in approximately 5% of subjects. Local injection site reactions were 
not dose- related.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Study ORION -2 (MDCO- PCS- 16-02,  also referred  to as CKJX839A12202) 
ORION- 2 (MDCO -PCS-16-02 completed study ) was a Phase II, open label, single arm, 
multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_76580]  (HoFH) . Four 
s
ubjects were randomized and  recei ved open -label inclisiran  sodium 300 mg  SC on Day 1. The 
subsequent dosing interval was determined by [CONTACT_6564]9 level at Day 60 or 90 or rate of change of PCSK9 between Days 60 and 90.  In three subjects mean serum PCSK9 levels were not suppressed by >70% at Day [ADDRESS_83201] had a significant reduction in PCSK9 but not a concomitant reduction in LDL -
C. The mean percentage LDL -C reduction from baseline was 12.3% and 21.0% at Day [ADDRESS_83202] dose.  
The mean percentage PCSK9 reduction from baseline was 59.0% and 62.9% at Day [ADDRESS_83203] recent visit. There  were 
no deaths and one SAE (unstable angina, which was not considered related to study drug). No subjects withdrew due to an adverse event and no adverse events at the injection site were reported.  
Elevations in chemistry parameters were observed. One subject with an elevated total bilirubin 
(>1x ULN) at screening experienced a single elevation of total bilirubin >2x ULN on Day 120. There were no ALT or AST elevations >[ADDRESS_83204] or CK elevations >5x ULN .

evaluate the PK, safety, and PD of a single dose of inclisiran sodium 300 mg, SC injection  in 
subjects with renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function . Subjects were 
classified into one of four renal function groups (normal, mild, moderate, and severe), as defined

from a spot serum creatinine level (Table 1 -1).

4 Severe renal impairment  15 to 29  
CrCl=creatinine clearance  
These subjects were matched for  age (+/ - 10 years), body weight (+/ - 20%), and proportional race 
and gender  in order to ensure that the normal renal function group  was comparable to the renal 
impairment groups for average demographics.  Thirty -one subjects were randomized into the study, 
eight subjects in each of the normal renal function and the mild and moderate renal impairment 
groups and seven in the severe renal impairment group. All subjects completed the study to Day 60. 
In individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, inclisiran C
max was 2.33, 1.97 and 
3.31 fold higher , respectively; AUC 0-24 was 1.75, 1.91 and 2.50 fold higher , respectively; AUC 0-48 
was 1.58, 1.83 and 2.33 fold higher , respectively; AUC 0-t was 1.53, 1.73 and 2.35 fold higher , 
respectively; AUC 0-inf was 1.44, 1.39 and 2.23 fold higher , respectively, relative to subjects with 
normal renal function . However, inclisiran was not detectable in plasma 48  hours after 
administration of a single 300 mg dose in any group irrespective of renal impairment.  
At Day 60, LDL -C (beta -quantification) was reduced by 57.56%, 35.11%, 53.09%, and 49.20%, 
in the normal renal function group and the mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups 
respectively. Mean LDL -C reduction was less in the mild renal impairment group compared to the 
other three groups. Overall, LDL -C reduction was generally simil ar between groups with no

1.4 Study Rationale  
1.4.1 Study Rationale 
The overall safety data from inclisiran in nonclinical studies a nd clinical data from the Phase I and 
Phase II  study  (ORION -1 also referred  to as CKJX839A12201) , and multiple PCSK9 antibody 
studies demonstrated that potent lowering of PCSK9 is well tolerated in human subjects and 
support the dose and dosing schedule proposed in this Phase III  extension  study. This extension 
study allows subjects continued access to inclisiran treatment and to allow the collection of 
additional efficacy and safety beyond the end of the original studies.

6 S chedule and sequence of procedures 
The Schedule of Events/Assessments ( Table 6 -1) summarizes the study assessments by [CONTACT_7206].  
This study will be a  long-term extension study for subjects considered “completers”  of the Phase 
II lipid lowering MDCO -PCS-16-01 (ORION- 3) or P hase III lipid lowering  ORION feeder studies  
[MDCO- PCS-17- 03 (ORION- 9), MDCO- PCS-17-04 ( ORION-10), or MDCO- PCS-17-08 
(ORION-11) ]. A “completer” of the previous study is defined as having received the final protocol 
dose of study drug and completing the final study visit/ and being considered a successful 
completion during the EOS visit . The EOS visit in the previous feeder study will be Day 1 in 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 28 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
ORION-8 trial except for subjects enrolled in Sweden (Section 3.1 and Section 6.3). The expected 
duration of the subjects’ involvement in the study will be a maximum of 3 years.  
On Day 1 (EOS visit in the feeder study), subjects will receive blinded study medication  except 
for subjects moving over from ORION -3. These subjects will receive the first study medication at 
day 90. Subjects who received placebo in the previous  Phase III  feeder study will receive blinded  
inclisiran  and subjects who received inclisiran in the previous feeder study will receive blinded 
placebo at this visit, in order to maintain the blinding of the feeder study until database lock of 
those studies.   
On Day 90, all s ubjects will receive inclisiran sodium  [ADDRESS_83228] injection in the previous feeder study for subjects  that received  
inclisiran and will be the second dose of inclisiran for the subjects that received placebo in the 
feeder study.  
The three study periods are:  
• Study Entry (Day 1):   
• The EOS visit procedures from the previous ORION feeder study will be used as the 
Day 1 data for this study except for subjects enrolled in Sweden (Section  3.1 and Section 
6.3). In addition, consent and eligibility assessment for this study will be completed.  
• Treatment Phases :   
• Double Blind: Day 1 (blinded inclisiran or blinded placebo) to Day 90 
• Open Label: Day 90 (open label inclisiran for all subjects ) and subsequent dosing visits 
with inclisiran every 180 days 
• End of Study (EOS): 
• The EOS visit will occur at Day [ADDRESS_83229] Inclisiran for 
Injection  dose once one of the following criteria are met:  
• the investigator's rec ommendation of discontinuation 
• sponsor's recommendation of discontinuation 
• an administrative decisi on is made to end the study 
• NOTE:  For subjects prematurely and permanently discontinued from study treatment, who are not willing to return within the 90 day timeframe, the EOS visit will be scheduled as soon as possible , or if decision to discontinue and not return is made at a 
specific visit, this visit will become the EOS visit and EOS visit procedures should be followed . 
6.1 Schedule of Events/Assessments  
The schedule of assessments is provided in  Table 6 -1. 
If the COVID -19 pandemic limits or prevents on -site study visits, alternative methods of providing 
continuing care may be implemented. Phone calls or remote/ virtual contacts (e.g. teleconsult) can 
replace on -site study visits, for the duration of the pandemic until it is safe for the participant to 
visit the site again.   Also, the visits window has been extended to + /-2 months  during the pandemic.

Severity is an estimate or measure of the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs are indications of adverse subject outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE need not necessarily be considered serious and a serious AE need not be considered severe. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, a MI  that may 
be considered minor could be an SAE if it prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
8.1.3 Special Situations – Adverse Events 
There are situations when information is not necessarily considered an adverse event but can 
possibly contribute to the overall knowledge concerning the safety of the investigational product.  
Examples include, but are not limited to, reports of  pregnancy/lactation exposures with or without 
any AEs related to the parent or child ; medication errors – actual and potential ; accidental 
exposure ; suspected transmission via an investigational product  of an infectious agent; drug 
interaction.  
8.2 Collection and Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.2.1 A dverse Event Severity  
The severity of AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_76622] 3-point scale below: 1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity 2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
8.2.[ADDRESS_83244] will  be assessed by [CONTACT_2329] a 
binary assessment. The i nvestigator should determine whether there is a ‘Reasonable possibility’ 
or ‘No reasonable possibility’ that the investigational product caused the event  based on the 
definitions below . 
Reasonable possibility  
 - There is a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
investigational product  caused the AE. There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the investigational product and the AE No reasonable possibility  - The
 re is no reasonable possibility that the administration of the  
investigational product  caused the AE. There is no temporal relationship between the 
investigational product and event onset, or an alternative etiology has been established  
8.3 Requirements For Additional Safety Data Collection  
8.3.1 Special Situations – Additional Safety Data Collection 
Special Situations designated for this study include:  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 37 of 51

criteria are positive, confirm by [CONTACT_76624] 30 minutes of symptoms   
• Hyperglycemia- related AEs:  
Report ‘New onset of diabetes’ in subjects with no medical history of diabetes when: 
o HbA1C becomes ≥6.5% and/or  
o If a new concomitant medication for control of plasma glucose is added, further 
information to assess for a diagnosis of new onset diabetes will be collected  
Report ‘Worsening of the glycemic control’ or ‘diabetic complications’ in subjects with a medical 
history of disease (HbA1C ≥6.5% at baseline) when:  
o HbA1C increases from baseline > 0.5% and/or  
o New concomitant medication or increase in dose of current antidiabetic therapy is initiated to improve the control of plasma glucose level 
8.4 Procedure for Adverse Event Reporting  
8.4.1 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
All SAEs that occur from consent (Day1) through EOS must be reported to [COMPANY_001] safety  within 
[ADDRESS_83245] additional information. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 38 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
 If the investigator is notified of a SAE  that occurs post -study period, that he or she wishes to  report 
to the Sponsor (eg, an event suspected to be causally related to investigational product), the event 
should be reported through the process described above.  
Where appropriate, if required by [CONTACT_76625], the i nvestigator  should report 
these events to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and/or national 
regulatory authority in addition to the Sponsor.  Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements are to be found in the 
investigator folder provided to each site. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_83246].  8.4.3 Special situations – Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medication Errors 
All AEs (serious and non- serious) that occur in association with medication errors should be 
recorded in the AE page eCRF. Serious AEs should also be reported to [COMPANY_001] safety    as 
described in section 8.4.1. No record of Medication Error itself should be included on the AE 
eCRF page . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure  
Occurrences of pregnancy/lactation exposure  in a study subject from Day [ADDRESS_83247] be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours using the Pregnancy/Lactation  Exposure Report Form.  
In cases where a pregnancy /lactation exposure  occurs with a SAE, the SAE Report  Form should 
be used to report the SAE  and the Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure  Report F orm should be used to 
report the pregnancy/lactation exposure.  
When a pregnancy/lactation exposure  occurs without any concurrent SAE, the 
Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure Report F orm must be submitted alone.  
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  Newborns should be followed for 12 
months. 
8.5 Expectedness 
8.5.1 Expectedness Determination  
[COMPANY_001] safety d epartment will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected for the purpose of suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting. 
An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the safety information previously described for the investigational product in the current/approved version of the Investigator ’s Brochure.

 Appendix A : Sampson Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:  
• Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. T wo or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen for that 
patient  (minutes to several hours):  
a. I nvolvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -
tongue-uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze, bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, painful abdominal cramps, vomiting)  
3. R
educed blood pressure after exposure to a known allergen for that patient  (minutes to 
several hours):  
a. I nfants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or >30% decrease in 
systolic blood pressure* 
b. Adults: systolic blood pressure <90 millimeters of mercury  (mmHg) or >30% decrease 
from that person’s Day 1 reading 
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is age specific and defined as: <70 mmHg for age 1 
month to 1 year; <70 mmHg + [2 x age] for age 1 to years; <90 mmHg for age 11 to 17 years.

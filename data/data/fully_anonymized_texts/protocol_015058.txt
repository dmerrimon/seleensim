1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
The main objective of the study will be to test the hypothesis that reduced muscle ATP flux may underlie the 
myopathy seen in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH).
2.Probable Duration of Project: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
2.5 years from start up to completion
3.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
X-linked hypophosphatemia is a skeletal dysplasia. The mineralized tissue complications of XLH have been the 
focus of investigative studies seeking to understand its pathogenesis, as well as studies directed at new 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. However, in addition to their skeletal complaints, patients with XLH have among their most 
frequent symptoms, fatigue and weakness, which manifest as both a generalized sense of a lack of energy as 
well as a more specific feeling that their muscular function is impaired. Objectively, patients complain of 
fatigue after exertion, when otherwise they do not think they should expect to feel so spent. These symptoms 
occur in individuals who otherwise have good cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_38324], so co-morbidities are 
unlikely to explain these pervasive complaints. Anecdotally, our open-label trial data using KRN23 suggest that 
these symptoms are dramatically ameliorated by [CONTACT_206499]. In a recent study¹, we found that 
when stressed by a low-phosphate diet, rates of insulin-stimulated myocyte ATP flux were reduced by 50% in 
an experimental model of systemic hypophosphatemia (the NaPi2a knockout mouse). Moreover, ATP 
synthetic flux correlated directly with cellular and mitochondrial phosphate uptake in two rodent myocyte cell 
lines, as well as in freshly isolated myocyte mitochondria. As direct evidence that these preclinical findings are 
relevant to human hypophosphatemic genetic syndromes we studied a patient with Heredity 
Hypophosphatemic Rickets with Hypercalciuria (HHRH) who was not being treated at the time of our 
experiment. In this patient who had a 50% reduction in serum phosphate, muscle ATP content was also 
significantly reduced ¹. Both of these parameters normalized completely with oral phosphate repletion ¹. 
These data strongly support the hypothesis that reduced muscle ATP flux may underlie the myopathy seen in 
our patients with XLH. We propose to directly test this hypothesis, in patients about to begin treatment with 
Crysvita®.
4.Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times 
and lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
We will only recruit patients who the PI [INVESTIGATOR_206492]-collaborators have decided, based on their 
clinical exam and review of the potential subject’s history, biochemical and radiographic studies, qualify for 
Crysvita® therapy. Patients will only be invited into the study because they are planning to start Crysvita for 
clinical indications. While the participants are enrolled in the study, Ultragenyx will provide drug for the [ADDRESS_246344] enrolls in the study we plan to obtain 
approval for Crysvita® from their insurers so that at study end, their treatment will not be interrupted. If there 
is a delay in obtaining approval from the insurer, Ultragenyx has a program that provides drug at no cost to 
the subject while the dermination process moves forward.

supi[INVESTIGATOR_206493]-Bruker NMR spectrometer (1-meter bore, 4.0 Tesla). The gastrocnemius 
muscle of the right leg is positioned appropriately within the magnetic field, and placed on top of a surface 
coil probe.  Motion of the leg is minimized with Velcro straps and a foam foot holder. Study participation 
requires approximately 120 minutes for this part. Our findings would be correlated with the changes in serum 
phosphorus, TmP/GFR, 1,25(OH) 2vitamin D, pain scores, dynamometry and most importantly the results of 
the six-minute walk test. 
The study protocol involves five visits, 1-5. There are three visits that involve MR Spectroscopy. Those are 
MRS1, MRS2 and MRS3. There are three dosing visits. The Crysvita® will be prescribed at the recommended 
adult dose of 1 mg/kg body weight, rounded to the nearest 10 mg up to a maximum dose of 90 mg. The 
Crysvita prescribing information will be followed. Depending on the patient’s lab work at the following visits 
and from other clinical data their dose may be adjusted during the course of the study. The first coincides 
with Visit [ADDRESS_246346] dose of Crysvita® is given, 
(MRS1), the second MR study is 2 weeks after Dose 3 (Visit 4 at the peak of Crysvita’s® action), denoted

2Serum Phos will be measured by [CONTACT_206500] (standard of care) [ADDRESS_246347] 2 
doses of Crysvita/burosumab. After the 3rd dose of Crysvita/burosumab peak serum phos will be measured in 
the study and results shared with the clinical physician.
The visits that incorporate MR Spectroscopy (visits 1, 4 and 5) involve blood work that includes fasting serum 
calcium, phosphate, creatinine, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, and bone-specific alkaline 
phosphatase, On the other visits (Visits 2 and 3) only a serum phosphate and a serum calcium will be measured. A 
fasting serum FGF23 will be drawn only at Visit 1.
A full physical exam, vital signs, height and weight and renal ultrasound will be done at baseline. For all 
subsequent visits, vital signs and a limited physical exam will occur.
Spot fasting urine creatinine, phosphate, and calcium will be collected at the three MR Spectroscopy visits and 
TmP/GFR calculated at each of these visits. A urine pregnancy text will be done at each visit prior to the MR 
Sprectroscopy or dosing and patients will not participate if pregnant.
All samples for blood and urine will be processed on the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96051] (HRU) and sent for analysis at the 
YCCI core lab in batches. Calcium and phosphorus samples will be sent to the YNHH Chemistry department for 
analysis since these data will need to be reviewed promptly for Crysvita dosing. For the batch samples, samples 
will be run as patients complete the study to avoid any inter-assay variability.
Functional testing will occur after each MR spectroscopy analysis. The study coordinator(s) will be trained by 
[CONTACT_206501] (PT) staff and monitored at the start to ensure the positioning of the patient and the 
testing is being done correctly. The following tests of physical function will be conducted at visits 1,4 and 5. 
oComprehensive dynamometry for both UE’s (handrip) andLE’s(knee extension and flexion, hip 
flexion, extension and abduction) 
oWeighted arm
oHeel rises
oSix-minute walk test 
oTimed Up and Go (TUG)
o30-second Sit to Stand Test
Finally, the KOOS and PROMIS questionnaires to measure pain, stiffness, fatigue  and physical function will be 
employed at each MR study visit.

10.Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
1. Blood sampling: May cause slight discomfort when the sample is drawn.  There is the 
potential for slight bruising at the needle site; infection or swelling rarely 
occurs. These risks are minimized through the use of trained personnel to
perform the blood draw. The amount of blood to be drawn at each visit (visit 1-25 ml, visits 2 and  
3- 5ml each and visits 4 and 5- 20 ml each totaling 75 ml) and over the course of the study does 
not pose a risk. This amounts to 5 tablespoons over the course of 3 months.
2.  MR Spectroscopy and 31P MRS : In order to monitor muscle ATP synthesis the subject’s leg will be 
placed in a 4T MR Spectrometer to obtain 31P-spectra from the gastrocnemius muscle. The radio 
frequency power and magnetic field strength to be used for the MRS in this study present no 
known hazards to human subjects without ferro-magnetic metals in or on their body.  Special 
care will be taken to exclude subjects with these type of objects. The subjects will be under 
continuous surveillance while in the magnet. A physician will be immediately available at all

MR spectroscopy: The radio frequency and magnetic fields to be used for the 31P MR 
spectroscopy in this study present no known hazards to human subjects without ferromagnetic 
metals or pacemakers.  Special care will be taken to exclude these subjects from the study. There 
are no known long-term risks associated with MR spectroscopy or imaging (MRI).
Magnetic resonance (MR) is a technique that uses magnetism and radio waves, not x-rays, to take 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_57180]. The [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has set guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio waves, and we 
carefully observe those guidelines.
Consent is obtained in a private setting in the MRRC (Magnetic Resonance Research Center) or 
during the HIC study on the HRU prior to any study related procedures. Any subject with concerns 
about participation or who may have any of the issues listed under exclusion criteria will not be 
enrolled. [CONTACT_162313]’s (Professor of Medicine Endocrinology at Yale specializing in MR 
Sprectroscopy) study record over the years shows that they are very careful and rather will not 
study a subject than take any chances. The subjects will be under continuous surveillance while in 
the magnet. A physician will be immediately available at all times. All subjects will fill out the 
standard YNHH-MRI metal screen questionnaire prior to being placed in the magnet.
The subjects will be watched closely throughout the MR study.  Some people may feel 
uncomfortable or anxious. If this happens, the subject may ask to stop the study at any time and 
we will take him/her out of the MR scanner. On rare occasions, some people might feel dizzy or 
get an upset stomach.  These sensations usually go away quickly but the subjects will be 
instructed to tell us if they occur.
   
 If the patient has a history of anxiety or lying still is a known concern, Ativan 0.5-1.0 mg (a 
routinely used mild sedative and anti-anxiety) will be prescribed for the patient to take prior to 
each MR study as needed. If Ativan is used, we will ensure the patient has transportation to and 
from the study visit and they are monitored by [CONTACT_206502]. The Ativan would be prescribed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Insogna and filled by [CONTACT_206503]. Common side effects of Ativan include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, 
nausea, blurred vision or loss of coordination. Since only a low dose  (0.5-1.0 mg Ativan) would be 
prescribed, we anticipate side effects to be very mild and temporary if they do occur at all and to 
resolve prior to the patient returning home.
There are some risks with an MR study for certain people. Subjects with a pacemaker or some 
metal objects inside the body may not be in this study because the strong magnets in the MR 
scanner might harm them. Another risk is the possibility of metal objects being pulled into the 
magnet and hitting people. To reduce this risk we require that all people involved with the study 
remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets. We also ask all 
people involved with the study to walk through a detector designed to detect metal objects. It is 
important to know that no metal can be brought into the magnet room at any time. Also, once 
the subject is in the magnet, the door to the room will be closed so that no one from outside 
accidentally goes near the magnet.

This MR study is for research purposes only and is not in any way a clinical examination.  The 
scans performed in this study are not designed to find abnormalities. The primary investigator, 
the lab, the MR technologist, and the Magnetic Resonance Research Center are not qualified to 
interpret the MR scans and are not responsible for providing a diagnostic evaluation of the 
images. If a worrisome finding is seen on a scan, a radiologist or another physician will be asked 
to review the relevant images. Based on his or her recommendation (if any), the primary 
investigator or consulting physician will contact [CONTACT_423], inform him/her of the finding, and 
recommend that he/she seeks medical advice as a precautionary measure.  The decision for 
additional examination or treatment would lie solely with the subject and his/her physician.  The 
investigators, the consulting physician, the Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and Yale 
University are not responsible for any examination or treatment received based on these 
findings. The images collected in this study are not a clinical MR exam and for that reason, they 
will not be made available for diagnostic purposes.
Female subjects of childbearing potential will require urine pregnancy testing prior to enrollment 
in the protocol. Because full confidentiality regarding pregnancy cannot be entirely guaranteed, 
these testing requirements and the limited scope of confidentiality will be made known to all 
subjects during the consent procedure. In this manner, young women who would not be 
comfortable with pregnancy testing or sharing the results of such testing can “opt out” of the 
study at the time of the initial consent, without having to declare specific reasons.
Minimizing Risks of MRI: By [CONTACT_206504]. All 
subjects are asked to change into scrubs and to remove all personal items (including pi[INVESTIGATOR_206494]) before the study.
3. Urine sampling: There is no associated risk although it may be inconvenient
4. Comprehensive dynamometry for both UE’s and LE’s, weighted arm, sit to stand and heel rises: 
Subjects could potentially experience muscle strain if they exert themselves excessively during 
these tests. A trained coordinator or PT will instruct study subjects in the appropriate execution 
of these tests to mitigate this risk.
5. Six-minute walk test and Timed Up and Go: Patients may find the exertion associated with this 
test a barrier to completing it successfully. Patients will be constantly monitored by [CONTACT_206505] [ADDRESS_246352] and a nurse on the HRU

Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with XLH
The safety data described below reflect exposure to CRYSVITA in 68 adult XLH patients, age 20-63 
years (mean age 41 years), of whom most were white/Caucasian (81%) and female (65%). These 
patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in adults 
with XLH ([ADDRESS_246353] 24 week and 66 patients received Placebo), 
The mean Crysvita dose was 0.95 mg/kg (range 0.3 – 1.2 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 4 weeks. 
At Week 24 the subjects in the Placebo arm crossed over to Crysvita therapy for the next 24 
weeks; and those in the Crysvita arm continued on Crysvita for 24 weeks.
Adverse reactions reported in more than 5% of CRYSVITA-treated patients and 2 patients or more 
than with placebo from the 24-week placebo-controlled portion of Study 3 are shown in Table 2.

Hypersensitivity Reactions
In the double-blind period of Study 3, approximately 6% of patients in both the CRYSVITA and 
placebo treatment groups experienced a hypersensitivity event. The events were mild or 
moderate and did not require discontinuation.
Hyperphosphatemia
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/4/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/4/2021Page 10 of 25 Version 9 01OCT2021In the double-blind period of Study 3, 7% of patients in the CRYSVITA treatment group 
experienced hyperphosphatemia meeting the protocol-specified criteria for dose reduction 
(either a single serum phosphorus greater than 5.0 mg/dL or serum phosphorus greater than 4.5 
mg/dL [the upper limit of normal] on two occasions). The hyperphosphatemia was managed with 
dose reduction. The dose for all patients meeting the protocol-specified criteria was reduced 50 
percent. A single patient required a second dose reduction for continued hyperphosphatemia.
Injection Site Reactions (ISR)
In the double-blind period of Study 3, approximately 12% of patients in both the CRYSVITA and 
placebo treatment groups had a local reaction (e.g. injection site reaction, erythema, rash, 
bruising,  pain, pruritus, and hematoma) at the site of the injection. Injection site reactions were 
generally mild in severity, occurred within [ADDRESS_246354] all instances.
                              Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)
                              In the double-blind period of Study 3, approximately 12% of the CRYSVITA treatment group had 
worsening of baseline restless leg syndrome (RLS) or new onset RLS of mild to moderate severity;  
these events did not lead to dose discontinuation. Non-serious RLS has also been reported in other 
repeat dose adult XLH studies; in one case, worsening baseline RLS led to drug discontinuation and 
subsequent resolution of the event.

Immunogenicity
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody 
formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the 
observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be 
influenced by [CONTACT_17812], sample handling, timing of sample 
collection,  concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of 
the incidence of antibodies to burosumab-twza may be misleading.  Pre-existing anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) have been detected in up to 10% of patients in clinical studies. ADA was not 
detected in patients who were antibody negative at the start of treatment.  However, the assay 
used to measure ADA is subject to interference by [CONTACT_206507]-twza,  possibly resulting in 
an underestimation of the incidence of antibody formation. Due to the limitation of the assay 
conditions, the potential clinical impact of antibodies to burosumab-twza is not known.
Allergic reaction
An allergic-type reaction to Crysvita® is possible.  Allergic-type reactions may be serious or life 
threatening. The study doctor or nurse will monitor the patient during and after the 
administration of the study drug. If the participant does develop an allergic reaction, the study 
doctor or nurse will give them medicines to stop or lessen the allergic reaction. Some things that 
could be a sign or symptom of an allergic reaction (including more severe allergic reactions such 
as anaphylaxis) are:

Reproductive Risks and Contraceptive Measures
Crysvita® has not been studied in pregnant or breast feeding women or in the sperm of men 
taking Burosumab. It should not be taken if a woman is pregnant or planning to become pregnant 
during the study. The study drug may involve risks to the patient or to the unborn baby [CONTACT_206508].
It is recommended that sexually active females of childbearing potential use a highly effective 
method of contraception during sex throughout the study period.
1.  Established use of hormonal contraceptives, such as the contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], injection or 
implant   
2.  Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), a small device with hormones that 
goes   
          inside the  uterus 
3. Male sterilization, also called vasectomy
4.  Complete abstinence, which means not having sex because you choose not to.   
Sexually active males must use one of the highly effective methods of contraception above 
(such as complete abstinence) or a condom with spermicide during sex throughout the 
study period
We plan to obtain urine pregnancy tests in all females of child-bearing potential at each 
study visit prior to the MR spectroscopy or Crysvita dosing. Pregnant females will be 
exclused from the study.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/4/2021Page 12 of 25 Version 9 01OCT20218. As noted to participate in this study subjects will need to discontinue conventional therapy (if 
they are taking it) for two weeks before beginning Crysvita therapy.
9. The risks of Crysvita® will be minimized by [CONTACT_206509]. Drs. Insogna, Carpenter and Bergwitz have been safely using this drug 
in clinical trials over the last several years and have been prescribing it to their clinic patients 
since April [ADDRESS_246356] approved.
11.Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
See above under each risk.
12.Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on 
the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk 
to subjects.)
a. What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this 
study? Greater than minimal risk
b. If children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the 
children participating in this study? N/A
c. Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Examples of DSMPs are  
available here +for
i. Minimal risk
ii. Greater than minimal
Greater Than Minimal Risk DSMP
1. Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol compliance, and 
conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which must be conducted at a minimum of every 6 
months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought). During the review process, the principal 
investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require 
modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_206496].
2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for the following reasons: (choose 
those that apply)
1. We do not view the risks associated with the MR spectroscopy and Crysvita ®, the FDA approved 
medication for X-linked hypophosphatemia, as minimal risks.
2. Given the now established good safety profile for and efficacy of Crysvita, as well as the long, published 
track record [CONTACT_162313] has safely using MR spectroscopy, we do not view the proposed studies as high 
risk.
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists for 
anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to predict 
with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience with the proposed 
study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/4/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/4/2021Page 13 of 25 Version 9 01OCT20213. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_206491], MD according to the following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0 scale will be used in grading the severity 
of adverse events noted during the study or the following scale when CTCAE criteria is not available:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverse event
3. Severe 
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_170560] a 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes:
1. Death;
2. A life-threatening experience 
3. in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
4. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
5. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
6. Any other important medical event  i.e an adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  Similarly, an 
adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_121380] “seriousness” when determining whether reporting to the IRB is 
necessary.
6. Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse Events) to the IRB
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: 
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1. Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol and 
informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/4/2021Page 14 of 25 Version 9 01OCT20212. Is related (definitely, probably or possibly related) to participation in the research (possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]); AND
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
4. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non-
medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related (definitely, 
probably or possibly) adverse events and unanticipated adverse device effects. Please note that 
adverse events are reportable to the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria listed above, which 
are, 1, unexpected 2, assessed as definitely, probably, or possibly related to the study and 3, 
suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the appropriate forms 
found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting requirements 
described in IRB Policy [ADDRESS_246357] to oversight by a DSMB (or other monitoring entity that is 
monitoring the study on behalf of an industry sponsor).
7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the protocol’s research 
monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), Protocol 
Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-
making bodies.
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified (choose those 
that apply):
X All Co-Investigators listed on the protocol.
□ Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)
□ National Institutes of Health
□ Food and Drug Administration (Physician-Sponsored IND #_______)
□ Medical Research Foundation (Grant______)

□ Other Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or Committee (DSMC)
The principal investigator (Karl Insogna) will conduct a review of all adverse events upon completion of every 
study subject. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_206497].
Please note: For any study that may be considered high risk, the IRB will be more focused on the safety 
requirements for the study and a DSMB will likely be required.

13.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design. 
Sample Size Estimate (note references cited are included at the end of Section I above 
Serum Phosphate:
Using previously published studies 1,5,6, a sample size of 10 paired observations, with a within-person 
correlation in the range of 10-50%, achieves greater than 90% power to detect a statistically significant 
increase at alpha of 0.05 in the expected mean serum phosphate level from around 1.7-2.0 mg/dL at baseline 
to at least 3.0 mg/dL at 6-month follow up. These results are based on [ADDRESS_246358] deviation of serum phosphate in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 mg/dL
VATP:
Similarly, using previously published studies 1,5,6 ,a sample size of 10 paired observations, with a within-person 
correlation in the range of 10-50%, achieves greater than 90% power to detect a statistically significant 
increase at alpha of 0.05 in the expected mean muscle V ATP flux rates from 3.5 micro-mol/g/min at baseline to 
at least 5.5 micro-mol/g/min at 6-month follow up. These results are based on [ADDRESS_246359] deviation of V ATP  in the range of  0.7 to 1.3 micro-mol/g/min. 
Analytical Approach
Patient characteristics will be summarized using mean (standard deviation) and median (range) for 
continuous variables, and using counts and percents for categorical variables. The distributions of the primary 
outcomes of interest (serum phosphate level and V ATP) at each evaluation will be presented visually using box-
plots. The primary analysis of the comparison of baseline and 3-month follow up distributions of the two 
outcomes will be performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Medians will be compared using the 
Hodges-Lehmann estimator 7,8. If the outcomes are normally distributed, we will also use the paired t-test to 
compare the means at baseline and 6 months. Confidence intervals for the differences in the medians and 
the means of the outcomes will be obtained using the Hodges-Lehmann’s estimator and the t-distribution, 
respectively, and all estimates will be bootstrapped. Significance will be established at alpha of 0.05. 
Secondary analyses will involve examining the longitudinal trajectories of the two outcomes over time, with 
baseline and [ADDRESS_246360] of time on the levels of each outcome. 
Individual trajectories as well as the observed and estimated means (95%CIs) and medians (95%CIs) will be 
plotted over time using the spaghetti plot. Analyses will be performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) and R 
statistical software.

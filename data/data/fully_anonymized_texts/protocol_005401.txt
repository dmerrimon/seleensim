Title of Study:
A Phase 2a ,Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled , Two Period, Crossover Study to Assess
the Effect of CK -2127107 on Physical Function in Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
Disease
Planned Study Period:
From 1Q2016to 1Q2017
Study Objective(s): 
Primary Objective
● To assess the effect of CK -2127107 relative to placebo on cycle ergometer exercise tolerance , 
assessed as change from period baseline in constant work rate (CWR) endurance time, utilizing a 
breath -by-breath metabolic measurement system with integrated elec trocardiogram (ECG). The 
time to intolerance is assessed by a stopwatch and verified from electronic recordings of the 
cycle ergometer.
Secondary Objectives
● To assess cardiopulmonary and neuromuscular effects of CK -2127107 relative to placebo on:
oThe c hange from period baseline in oxygen uptake (VO 2), ventilation (V E), ventilatory 
equivalent for carbon dioxide (V E/VCO 2) and other breath -by-breath cardiometabolic 
variables, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_14008] (IC) and perceived exertion for dyspnea and leg d iscomfort

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1Study Population:
Male and female subjects aged40to 75 years old with COPD
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled/Randomized:
Approximately 40 subjects are planned to be randomized.
Study Design Overview:
This is a phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , two period, crossover study to
assess the potential effect s on physical function and safety of CK -2127107 in subjects with COPD .
Enrolled subjects willbe randomly assigned to 1 of 2treatment sequences and will receive both 
CK-2127107 andmatching placebo over 2treatment periods as per the following schedule .
Sequence Treatm ent Period 1 Treatm ent Period 2
1 CK-2127107 Placebo
2 Placebo CK-2127107
Each treatment period consists of 14days dosing of CK-2127107 or matching placebo.  Each 
medication period is separated by a 14 -day washout period.  The total study duration including 
screening period and follow -up visit(FUV) for an individual subject will be approximately 12 weeks

1.1 Back ground
Chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD) is an obstructive and progressive airway  
disease. The leading cause of COPD is smoking. According to the World Health Organization 
(WHO), COPD is the fifth leading cause of death in the world, with approximately  3 million 
deaths pe r annum, or 5% of deaths [WHO, 2015].   People with COPD experience limitations in 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_359368], resulting in a significant reduction in physical activity  and 
psychological problems, all of which contribute to the patient’s disability  and poor quality  of 
life. Standard treatments are bronchodilators, corticosteroids and pulmonary rehabilitation.
Overall, poor exercise capacity  in COPD patients or overall low levels of phy sical activity  
are indicated to correlate with increased mortality  [Waschki et al, 2011; Garcia -Aymerich et 
al, 2006; Oga et al, 2003].  The patho -physiological processes underl ying the relationship 
between ph ysical activity and survival in chronic diseases such as COPD are complex and 
not well understood [Aguilaniu, 2010]. To date, only  a few drugs have been shown to 
enhance exercise capacity of patients with COPD, including beta 2 agonists, tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_359369]-density  gas mixtures [O’Donnell et al, 2004; Palange et al, 2004; Celli et al, 2003].  
There is currentl y no pharmacological treatment available for skeletal muscle d ysfunction 
and wasting in chronic pulmonary  disorders. Troponin modulators and calcium sensitizers 
such as tirasemtiv and CK -[ADDRESS_448316] skeletal muscle to calcium (Ca2+) and slow 
the rate of Ca2+ release from the regulatory  troponin complex of fast skeletal muscle, 
resulting in a sensitization of the contractile apparatus to calcium.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1The American Thoracic Society  (ATS) and the European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_21618]  (ERS) have 
recentl y updated their statement on limb muscle dysfunction in COPD, recognizing this to be 
a key  systemic consequence of COPD [Maltais e t al, 2014]. According to this official 
statement of the ATS, assessment of limb muscle function could serve to identify  patients at 
increased risk of poor clinical outcomes such as exercise intolerance and premature mortality .  
Current treatment options for limb muscle dy sfunction include rehabilitative exercise training 
or neuromuscular electrical stimulations, particularly  in patients who are severel y impaired or 
suffering exacerbations.
A variet y of interventions have been tested in order to improve mu scle function in patients 
with COPD such as ox ygen, nutritional supplements with or without exercise, anabolic 
steroids such as testosterone, growth hormone and other bioactive nutrients. Exercise 
training appears to improve muscle strength, endurance and fatigability , but the magnitude of 
response to exercise is highl y variable.
In contrast to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517], limb muscles demonstrate plasticity  in response to 
exercise and could therefore provide an opportunity for novel drug targets. The aim is t o find 
treatment options to improve limb muscle function and reduce overall disability  [Ribeiro et 
al, 2013]. CK-[ADDRESS_448317] skeletal muscle 
over slow or cardiac muscle and may  produce benefit in patients by  [CONTACT_359409].
There are a variety  of exercise tests available in order to quantify  changes in exercise 
capacity  in COPD patients such as timed walk tests ([ADDRESS_448318]) or 
incremental cardiopulmonary  exercise testing and constant work rate exercise testing.  
Constant work rate cy cle ergometry  has been found useful to detect improvemen ts in exercise 
tolerance after an intervention [Borel B et al, 2013; Casaburi R, 2005; Oga T et al, 2000].  I n 
the currently  proposed stud y CK -2127107 is hy pothesized to improve the phy siological 
ability  to sustain endurance exercise b y demonstrating an in crease in constant work rate 
(CWR )endurance time.

both sexes at dose levels ≥ 150mg/kg and changes in urine color with an increased incidence 
in urine bilirubin in males and females across all dose levels. At 600 mg/kg per day , there 
were increases in the incidence of urine protein and, in a few females, detectable urine 
glucose. CK -2127107 -related microscopic findings of minimal to mild follicular cell

The results of testing CK -2127107 and CK -2127106 in the bacterial reverse mutation, in 
vitro cy togenetic and in vivo rodent bone marrow micronucleus (in this last test, 
CK-2127106 is an abundant metabolite formed after dosing CK -2127107) studies indicated a 
lack of genotoxic hazard.  
CK-2127107 has dete ctable absorbance in the UVA -UVB/visible range, but an in vitro 
phototoxicity  study  was negative .
While CK -2127107 is a substrate for cy tochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, CK -2127107 did not inhibit 
CYP isozy me activity  (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4) in vitro, either di rectly  or in a time -
dependent manner.  CK -2127107 (10 μM) did not activate transcription of human pregnane X 
receptor or ary l hydrocarbon receptor -regulated genes (i.e., CYP3A4 and CYP1A genes) 
compared with control compounds in vitro indicating no evidenc e for induction of these 
enzy mes. CK-2127107 inhibit edorganic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, multidrug and

and 2.59 μmol/L , respectively . The IC50values for other transporters such as MATE1, OAT1, 
MATE2 -K, OAT2, and OAT3 activity  were > 100μmol/L . The IC 50values for the metabolite,

changes in QT interval vs. placebo .
Two other studies were directed toward comparing the pharmacokinetics and tolerability  of 
different ph ysical forms or formulations of CK -2127107.  I n Study  CY 5014, the relative oral 
bioavailability  and pharmacokinetic profiles of the stabilized amorphous form of

(Study CY5013) performed with placebo, 300, [ADDRESS_448326] of CK -2127107 on changes from baseline in force -frequency  response showed 
significant increases relative to placebo. At 1, 3, 5 and 7 hours after administration of the 
1000 and 3000 mg doses o f CK -2127107, the changes from baseline in normalized AUC 
force (based on the sum of all frequencies) were statistically  significantl y greater than 
changes following placebo dosing. The [ADDRESS_448327] changes from baseline were observed at 
3hours postdose, which coincided with C max. 
The terminal half -life (t 1/2) of CK -2127107 was generall y around 12 hours with a t max of 2 to 
3hours.  The increase in exposure was largel y dose -proportional although exposure was 
more variable at doses ≥ 3000 mg.  The exposure of CK-2127107 w ashigher at stead y-state 
than after a single dose on day  1 with an accumulation ratio of approximately  3 to 4 at 
300mg and 4 to 5 at 500 mg(CY 5012) . Theinactive metabolite (CK -2127106) was present 
at 4%to 19% of the parent in plasma.  Exposure to CK -2127106 was higher at stead y-state 
than after a single dose with mean accumulation ratios > 20, consistent with its longer t 1/2of 
about 40 hours (CY 5012) .  Cmax and AUC values increased somewhat greater than 
dose-proportionall y following multiple dosing. There were no differences in 
pharmacokinetic parameters be tween y oung and elderly  subjects but mean exposure was 
slightly  higher in women versus men.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1CK-2127107 was well tolerated at all dose levels with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or 
discontinuations due to an adverse event (AE).  The most common (> 10%) AE s observed 
with CK -2127107 versus placebo were dizziness and headache. Gastrointestinal sy mptoms 
as a whole also exceeded the 10% incidence but the individual sy mptoms did not (abdominal 
pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). Dizziness and headache appeared to be dose -related and 
their incidence increased at doses of 2250 mg and above. None of the AEs were classified as 
severe. Four subjects in the multiple dose study , CY 5012 (1 treated with placebo and 
3treated with CK -2127107 500 mg), had an AE of “incr eased alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT)/hepatic enzy mes”; an additional 3subjects (all treated with CK -2127107 500 mg) had 
at least 1elevated liver enzy me during treatment with study  drug that w asnot reported as an 
AE.  Of these 7subjects, some of whom al so had modest bilirubin elevations, none had 
values that met Hy ’s Law criteria.  Other laboratory  tests remained normal and consistent 
with baseline values following dosing, with the exception of elevated serum creatinine values 
in most subjects treated wi th CK -2127107.  This was observed consistently across all studies. 
CK-2127107 has been demonstrated to inhibit OCT2, a mediator of renal tubular secretion of 
creatinine in the human kidney ,with an IC50of 2.59 μ mol/L [see the last paragraph of 
Section 1.2.1 , above ].  Consequently , it is believed that inhibition of renal tubular OCT2 by  
[INVESTIGATOR_243843]-[ADDRESS_448328] (LFT) , whether reported as a treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) or as a laboratory value. Of the 7subjects, some also had 
modest bilirubin elevations, but none had values that met Hy ’s Law criteria for drug -induced 
liver injury  (ALT or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] > 3 x the upper limit of normal 
[ULN], associated with total bilirubin [TBL ] > [ADDRESS_448329], with or without increases in alkaline 
phosphatase [AL P]). The clinical significance of these findings is not known at this time.  I n 
nonclinical toxicology  studies conducted out to [ADDRESS_448330] dose of 600 mg/kg, which 
is also the NOAEL.   See [Appe ndix 12.3 Liver Safety  Monitoring and Assessment ]for 
detailed information on liver abnormalities, monitoring and assessment .
A concentration -dependent increase in serum creatinine levels during treatment with 
CK-2127107 that returned to baseline after discontinuation of treatment has also been 
observed.  No renal toxicity  had been observed in nonclinical toxicology  studies although a 
similar increase in creatinine during dosing was noted in monkey  and rats after 13 weeks of 
exposure that was reversible.  At this time, it is believed that this finding is likely  due to 
inhibition of renal tubular OCT2 by  [INVESTIGATOR_243843]-2127107 , as OCT2 mediates renal tubular creatinine

as per the following schedule [ Table 2].  If the discontinuation rate in the first treatment 
period exceeds 10%, additional subjects will be recruited to ensure a total of at least 36 
subjects completing the study .
Table 2 Treatment Sequence
Sequence Treatm ent Period 1 Treatm ent Period 2

Each treatment period consists of 14days dosing of CK-2127107 or matching placebo. Each 
medication period is separated b y a 14 -day washout period.  The total study  duration 
including screening period and follow -up visit(FUV) for an individual subject will be 
approximately  12weeks (see Flow Chart [ Figure 1] and Schedule of Assessments [ Table 1]).
Subjects will attend up to 3screening visits (between day -28and day -1) prior to 
randomization at day 1 of treatment period 1 . At screening (visit s1and 2 between day s -28 
to -8)each subject will undergo standard procedures including resting spi[INVESTIGATOR_359374] a bronchodilator .Postbronchodilator forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_4034] 
1second ( FEV 1) expressed as a percent of predicted, and as the ratio of FEV 1/forced vital 
capacity  (FVC) will be an inclusion criteri on. Subjects will perform resting ECG and [ADDRESS_448334] (IET) to characterize the individual subject’s aerobic capacity  (VO 2
peak), lactate threshold, ventilatory  efficiency  (VE/VCO 2nadir) and peak work rate (WR), 
followed b y a CWR exercise test, both assessed on a cy cle ergometer.
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_448335] will be performed at 80% peak WR (rounded to the nearest 5 watts). This screening test is 
used to confirm the correct WR selection for the rest of the study  and to familiarize the subject 
with the testing procedure.  Subjects are expected to tolerate th is WR for durations in the range 
of 4to [ADDRESS_448336] treatment effects in interventional studies 
[Casaburi R, 2005 ; Puente -Maestu et al , 2016 ]. In the event that the tolerable duration is 
outside this range, a second CWR is performed within the next 5 day s at ± 5 watts to determine 
whether this adjusted WR will result in an endurance time in the desired range.  If this cannot 
be achieved with 2 adjustments (a total of 3 CWR tests), the subject will be classified as a 
screen failure and no additional assessments completed. Once the WR is established that leads 
to intolerance in 4 to 8 minutes, all subsequent tests use the WR that led to i ntolerance. No 
additional WR adjustments can be made once the WR intolerance level is set. 
On day  1 (visit 4) at baseline ,all subjects will complete postbronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] , 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_359375] ( MIP and MEP) , a resting ECG , CWR test (including 
breath -by-breath cardiometabolic measurements and respi[INVESTIGATOR_359376]) , quality  of life 
(QoL) assessments ( St. George’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_359377] [ SGRQ -C]and 
short form -36 [SF-36]),physical activity  assessments (7 -day reca ll online 12-item 
questionnaire) ,and a SPPB to establish period b aseline measurements , and will be randomly  
assigned to 1of 2treatment sequences in a 1:1 ratio.
To achieve stead y-state exposure to CK -2127107 , subjects willreceive CK -2127107 
(500 mg) ormatching placebo twice daily  for [ADDRESS_448337] renal and 
liver safet y assessments.
The subjects will then be invited back to the study site again on day  14 (visit 6) for the main 
assessment day  (MAD) visit for treatment period 1. Subsequent visits for the second period 
baseline ( visit 7) and treatment period 2 will then follow as per the Schedule of Assessments
[Table 1].
During the study , blood samples will also be collected at predefined time points for the 
assessment of plasma concentrations of CK -2127107 and possible metabolite(s) (if 
applicable) [See Se ction 5.6].One (voluntary ) blood sample for pharmacogenomics will also 
be taken prior to first dose at day1 of treatment period 1 (predose) .
Forall subjects , safet y will be assessed through the monitoring of AEs concomitant 
medications, vital signs (including blood pressure, heart rate and bod y temperature), clinical 
laboratory  assessments, phy sical examination and ECG parameters.
Upon completion of [ADDRESS_448338] will attend a FUV (visit 10), [ADDRESS_448339] dose or earl y withdrawal.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 12.2.2 Dose Rationale
The optimal dose for CK -212710 7 has not y et been determined, but CK -2127107 is expected 
to improve the phy sical (skeletal muscle) function in subjects at the same dose range and 
plasma concentration as those in healthy  subjects (Study  CY 5013 ).  The nonclinical studies 
conducted in hum an diaphragm obtained from biopsies indicated that CK -2127107 restored 
the contractile force of muscle fibers from subjects on mechanical ventilation to that of 
control muscle fibers.   In an assessment of running performance (NCD11 -055), CK -2127107 
increas ed running time in healthy  rats and rats with heart failure under slowly  accelerating 
conditions on a rotarod apparatus.
In the CY 5013 pharmacokinetic -pharmacod ynam ic study , the change in the force -frequency  
profile of the tibialis anterior muscle during transcutaneous stimulation of the common 
peroneal nerve and its relationship to CK -2127107 dose and plasma concentrations 
CK-2127107 was evaluated in healthy  male subjects .  CK -2127107 (300 and 1000 mg single 
dose) was associated with statistically  signifi cantly  greater changes in the force generated by  
[CONTACT_359410] (1, 3, 5 and 7 hours 
postdose) versus placebo.  The mean increase in force from baseline relative to placebo in 
CK-2127107 plasma conce ntration range > 1000 to 2000 ng/mL was 31.57%.  Thus, 
maintaining CK -2127107 plasma concentration in the range of 1000 to 2000 ng/mL or higher 
is expected to produce a pharmacod ynamic effect with CK -2127107 in humans. The 500 mg
twice dail y(daily dose of 1000 mg) was chosen based on the results of study  CY 5013.
The results of the CY 5012 multiple ascending dose study , demonstrated that steady -state 
CK-2127107 mean plasma C trough of 500 mg twice daily was higher than 2000 ng/mL, and 
was the refore considered an approp riate dose to be explored in a proof of pharmacology
study  while maintaining plasma exposures proven to be efficacious in the pharmacokinetic -
pharmacod ynamic study  (CY 5013).

2.3.2 Secondary Endpoints
The secondary  endpoints are as follows:
●Change from period baseline in VO 2, VE,VE/VCO 2, IC, as well as other cardiometabolic 
variables and perceived exertion for dy spnea and leg discomfort (Borg CR10) at 
isotime* and peak during CWR as compared to placebo

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1●Change from period baseline in activation of accessory  respi[INVESTIGATOR_4021] (by  [CONTACT_96516]) at 
isotime* and peak exercise during CWR
●Change in resting spi[INVESTIGATOR_359378]
*Isotime is the shortest duration of all of the CWR tests performed before and after treatment, 
not including screening.
These endpoints relate to the isotime phy siologic measurements that underpin the increase in 
exercise tolerance and represent an integrated examination of cardi opulmonary  measurements. 
The anal ysis of variables that are recorded breath -by-breath (e.g., VO 2, VE, VE/VCO 2) are 
facilitated b y averaging data over 20 second intervals within the metabolic cart s ystem 
(recorded b y the Vmax breath -by-breath metabolic mea surement system). Surface a ccessory  
muscle EMG activity  is recorded throughout the exercise and anal yzed over the same time 
intervals as the breath -by-breath data.  IC is recorded every  2 minutes during exercise; its 
measurement requires the subject to pr oduce a maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (from end -inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) on 
command every  [ADDRESS_448341] examination of each maneuver to assess quality . Therefore IC assessment of dy namic 
hyperinflation is obtained with 2 -minute resolution.
Resting spi[INVESTIGATOR_359379]. It is measured 
at approximately  the same time of day , at the same duration after the subjects’ morning dose 
of normal bronchodilator medications. Subjects will receive 2 puffs of albuterol in the 
laboratory 10to 15 minutes prior to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_359380].
2.3.3 Exploratory Endpoints
The exploratory  endpoints are as follows:
●Change from period baseline in Q oL outcomes (SGRQ -C, SF-36)relative to placebo
●Change from baseline in physical activity using a 7-day recall online 12-item 
questionnaire .
This will be assessed during onl y the first treatment period. Therefore, this will 
represent the response to placebo for half the subjects and the response to the study drug 
for the other half of subject s.
●Change from period baseline in physical performance tests battery  score (SPPB) relative 
to placebo
●Change from period baseline in MIP and MEP relative to placebo. This test is performed 
before exercise testing and is part of the resting assessment.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 15.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1 Demographics
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be collected during screening for all subjects 
according to the Schedule of Assessments [ Table 1] and will include date of birth, sex, race 
and ethnicity , height, body  weight, smoking history  and alcohol use. Vital signs such as 
heart rate, blood pressure, body  temperatu re as well as resting ECG are measured during 
screening.  Heart rate and ECG will also be recorded simultaneously  during all IET and 
CWR exercise tests.  Blood pressure will be taken by  [CONTACT_359423] y (approximately every 2 min) and recorded in the electronic exercise test record.
At screening a full pulmonary  function test that includes force expi[INVESTIGATOR_359385], lung 
volumes (including total lung capacit y [TLC], I C and residual volume [RV]) and diffusing 
capacity  will be perf ormed.  This will characterize the subject’s lung function and disease for 
entry  into the study . MIP and MEP are measured following the resting spi[INVESTIGATOR_359386] (visits 4, 6, 7 and EOT onl y). During the remainder of the trial, on ly the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  (FEV, FVC) and MI P/MEP will be measured. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  (FEV 1, FEV 1/FVC,

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment [IP_ADDRESS] IET and CWR
Subjects will perform IET and a CWR exe rcise test on a cycle ergometer. IET will be 
performed at screening visit [ADDRESS_448368]’s 
aerobic capacity  (VO 2 peak), lactate threshold, ventilatory  efficiency  (VE/VCO 2nadir) and 
peak WR.  The IET will not be repeated. At screening visit 2, the CWR test will be 
completed at least [ADDRESS_448369] will be performed at 
treatment period 1 (visits 4 and 6) and treatment period 2 (visits 7 and 9). 
In this protocol, a Vmax breath -by-breath metabolic measurement sy stem with integrated 
12-lead ECG and cy cle ergometer will be used. All variables are recorded breath -by-breath 
in the cardiopulmo nary exercise testing s ystem. Blood pressure, IC, as well as Borg CR10 
score ratings of d yspnea and leg discomfort, are recorded at isotime and peak during the 
CWR test.  Blood pressure is measured manuall y by [CONTACT_162014]. These values are manuall y 
entered into the electronic Vmax record of in the metabolic sy stem during the test.
The ergometer is computer controlled b y the metabolic sy stem and delivers the desired WR 
profile (IET or CWR). The ECG is monitored continuously ; heart rate is derived bea t-by-
beat from the ECG.  A [ADDRESS_448370]’s ECG can be stored in full (the full beat -by-
beat record) or a summary form.  Heart rate is recorded to the breath -by-breath record in the 
Vmax breath -by-breath metabolic measurement sy stem. Ge nerally , the subject will have 
about 5 minutes of recovery  recorded (i.e., with mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_359387] ).
The selection of the work rate for the initial testing has to be individualized to the subject’s 
exercise tolerance [Casaburi R, 20 05]. Establishing a period baseline duration for all subjects 
(normalized to within the 4 to 8 minute limit) allows for the correct interpretation of the 
change in post -treatment intervention exercise duration among different individuals’ ERS 
Statement [P uente -Maestu et al, 201 6].
CWR time to intolerance (endurance time) is assessed by  a stopwatch.  This is verified from 
the electronic record of the power output on the cycle ergometer.
[IP_ADDRESS] EMG
EMG will be performed at treatment period 1 (visits 4 and 6) and tr eatment period 2 (visits 7 
and 9).  Surface accessory  muscle EMG activity  will be measured during the exercise test.  
Surface electrodes are applied during the set -up for the exercise test; their application takes 
10minutes. The continuous time course of the EMG from each electrode is recorded for 
subsequent anal ysis.

Borg CR10 will be conducted during screening (visit 2).  Additionally  Borg CR10 will be 
performed at treatment period 1 (visits 4 and 6) and treatment period 2 (visits 7 and 9).
The 10 -item Borg Scale [Borg et al , 1982] is a simple method of rating perceived exertion 
(RPE) and collects information on perceived exertion in an individual's rating of exercise 
intensity  [Appendix 12.9].  The Borg CR10 will be administered and scored by  [CONTACT_359424]. Subjects will be asked to use this scale to rate the 
intensity  of their breathing and leg discomfort before, during, and after exercise.
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Activity
Physical activity  will be measured by [CONTACT_359425] 12 -item PRO questionnaire (7 -day recall

component scores, the Physical Component Summary  and the Mental Component Summary  
can also be calcu lated. 
For both the SF -36 domain scores and summary  scores, higher scores indicate better health 
status. The SF -36 has a recall period of the ‘past 4 weeks’.
The SF -36 will be scored by  [CONTACT_296088] y metrics.
[IP_ADDRESS] SPPB
SPPB will be performed at treatment period 1 ( visits 4 and 6) and treatment period 2 ( visits 7 
and 9).  SPPB is a simple test to measure lower extremity  function using tasks that mimic 
daily  activities; static balance, gait speed and getting in/out of a chair.
The SPPB score is based on timed measures of standing balance, walking speed and ability  to 
rise from a chair.  For the balance test, subjects will be asked to maintain their feet in side -
by-side, semi -tandem (heel of 1foot beside the big toe of the other foot) and tandem (heel of 
1foot in fron t and touching the other foot) positions for 10 seconds each. Walking speed 
will be assessed b y asking subjects to walk at their usual pace over a 4 -meter course. Two

summary  score (range 0 to 12) will be subsequently calculated b y adding the 3scores.  For 
the test of balance, subjects will be assigned the following scores: 1 if they could only  hold a 
side-by-side standing position for 10 seconds; 2 if they  coul d hold a semi -tandem position for 
10seconds, but were unable to hold a full -tandem position for more than 2 seconds; 3 if they  
could stand in a full -tandem position for 3 to 9 seconds; and 4 if they  could stand in a full -
tandem position for 10 seconds [Gu ralnik et al, 1994].

5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_448376] additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE.  I n these cases, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility  to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriatel y recor ded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) 
accordingl y.  
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam ination ) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets 1of 
the followin g criteria:
●Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  drug
●The abnormalit y or testvalue is clinically  significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Eve nts (SAEs)
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor , it results 
in any  of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life threatening ( an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investi gator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death) .
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disr uption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
●Results in congenital anomaly  or birth defect
●Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused b y AE is to b e considered 
as serious) 
●Other medicall y important events
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77746] 1of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above.  These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacity , should als o 
usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency  or drug ab use.
Safety  events of interest on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study  (e.g., stud y drug, comparator, background therap y) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
●Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
●Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol 3318 -CL-3002
-CONFIDENTIAL -
29 Nov 2017 Astellas Page 53of 100
Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1●Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)
●Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject exposure to 
the Sponsor medicin al product [e.g., name [CONTACT_2976] ])
All of the events of interest noted above should be recorded on the eCRF.  Any  situation 
involving these events of interest that also meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF and marked ‘serious’ on the SAE worksheet. 
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an AE is 
reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious ,” 
additional information on the event may  berequested.  
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
AEs that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "AEs whose 
relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out" .
Causal relationship
to the study drug Criteria for causal relationship
Not RelatedA clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a temporal 
relationship to study  drug administration which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and /orin which other drugs, chemicals or 
underly ing disease provide plausible explanations.
PossibleA clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of thestudy  drug, but which 
could also be explained by [CONTACT_113395]. Inf ormation on drug withdrawal may  be lacking or unclear.
ProbableA clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the study  drug, unlikel y 
to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically  reasonable response on re -administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities
●Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

Illnesses and conditions such as h ypotensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease 
thatmay lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted.  Nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic subjects and may  
be associated wi th fluctuating aminotransferase levels.  The investigator should ensure 
that the medical history  form captures any  illness that predates stud y enrollment that may 
be relevant in assessing hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (includi ng nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets.  Medications, including dose, are to be entered on the concomitant 
medicat ion page of the e CRF .  Information on alcohol, other substance use and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document .
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents .
●Based on the subject ’s history ,  other testing may  be appropriate including: 
Acute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D , E or other infectious agents) 
Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
Other laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations .
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possibl e etiology  on the LA -CRF or an

Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or 
acute liver disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subje ct may  be 
discontinued from the study .  The investigator may  determine that it is not in the subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enrollment.  Discontinuation of treatment should be considered

Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_448426]’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may  impact what treatment 
options are best suited for the subject.  Through investigation of PGx by  [CONTACT_190965][INVESTIGATOR_007], gene sequencing, stati stical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies, the 
relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or toxicity  may  be better 
understood.  As man y diseases may be influenced by 1or more genetic variations, PGx 
research may  identify which genes are involved in determining the way  a subject may  or may  
not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may  be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory .  The objective of this research will be to anal yze or d etermine genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and toxicity /safety  issues.
By [CONTACT_77816], it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTIC IPATION
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study  may  participate in this PGx substudy .  
As part of this substudy , subjects must provide written consent prior to providing any  blood 
samples that may  be used at a later time for genetic anal ysis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this substudy  will provide one 4 -mL tube of whole 
blood per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by  [CONTACT_201459] 
(first code).  Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO either directly  
from site or via a central laboratory  as directed b y Astellas.
PGx ANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established y et. Astellas may  initiate the PGx 
analysis in case evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be influencing the drug’s 
kinetics, efficacy  and/or safet y. 
DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES / DATA
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to [ADDRESS_448427]’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroy ed.  The results of any  PGx a nalysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal 
will be retained at Astellas indefinitely .

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 113 ATTACHMENT 1:  NON -SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMEN T 1
I.  The purpose of this amendment is:
1.Remove Accelerometer Test and Leg Extension Strength Test
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Remove accelerometer test and leg extensor strength test from the exploratory  objectives 
and endpoints.
RATIONALE:
To streamline assessments, exploratory  endpoints that would not significantly  contribute to 
the validity  of the primary  endpoint are removed.
2.Increase Number of Study Sites
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: 
Revise the number of study  sites to “approximately 4”.
RATIONALE:
The number of sites is amended to allow approximately  2 additional sites to participate in 
the study .
3.Clarify Number of Subjects Randomized in the Study
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Specify  that approximately  40 subjects “are planned to be randomized,” rather than “will 
be randomized.”
RATIONALE:
This change is made to allow for recruitment of additional subjects if the discontinuation 
rate in the first treatment period exceed s 5 subjects, in order to maintain the statistical 
power of 80 %.
4.Specify Assessment of Physical Activity
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Add language to specify  that phy sical activity  will be assessed using an online 12 -item 
patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire (7 -day recall clinical visit version of PRO 
active ph ysical activity  in COPD [ C-PPAC ])due to the removal of the accelerometer .
RATIONALE:
The accelerometer test is remov ed from the protocol as specif ied in non -substantial change 
No.1, therefore additional detail regarding continued use of the online 12 -item PRO
questionnaire is added for clarification.

29 Nov 2017 Astellas Page 86of 100
Version 3.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 15.Update Physical Examination
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Revise Section 5.4.4. (Phy sical Examination) to state that a full phy sical examination will 
be performed at screening and visit 10, while a s ymptom -directed ph ysical examination 
will be performed at the remaining visits 4, 6, 7, and 9.
RATIONALE:
This wording isupda ted to clarify  at which visits the full phy sical examination is required 
and which visits will allow a s ymptom -directed exam, based on the discretion of the study  
physician.  Language is added to specify  that a study  physician (MD or DO) will be able to 
delegate this task to a nurse practitioner and/or phy sician assistant per institutional policy . 
6.Revise Definition of Full Analysis Set
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Revise the definition of Full Analy sis Set (FAS) to state that subjects will be included in 
this treatment arm based on actual treatment received.
RATIONALE:
The purpose of the study  is to understand the action of the study  drug; therefore, it is more 
meaningful to include s ubjects in the FAS b ased on treatment received.
7.Minor Administrative -type Changes
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: 
Include mi nor administrative -type changes (e.g., ty pos, format, numbering and consistency  
throughout the protocol ) and update the List of Abbreviations, Flow Chart, and Schedule 
of Assessments .  
RATIONALE:
These changes are made to provide clarifications to the protocol and to ensure complete 
understanding of stud y procedures.

Final Version 1.0 2. INTRODUCTION  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common significant cardiac rhythm disorder and is associated 
with substantial mortality and morbidity.9 The estimated prevalence of AF is 0.4% to 1% in the 
general population, and increases with age.9,10 AF is also associated with increased morbidity 
and increased risk of thrombotic embolism and death.11-13 The rate of ischemic stroke among 
patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is estimated at 5% per year,14 with 1 of every 
6 strokes occurring in a patient with AF.15 The use of antithrombotic medications can mitigate 
some of the embolic risks associated with AF, and clinical guidelines recommend that 
anticoagulants be used in patients with more than 1 moderate risk factor.14 
Catheter ablation of AF has become a well -established therapeutic approach in symptomatic 
patients.14 However, AF catheter ablation is technically challenging and carries a risk of 
thromboembolic complications, likely associated with the catheters used in the left atrium, 
endothelial denudation, scar formation, and t issue inflammation.16-18 The incidence of 
thromboembolic events associated with AF ablation can be as high as 7%,[ADDRESS_964344] few years. Con siderable 
research has sought to overcome the limitations of available anticoagulant and antithrombotic 
agents, including efforts to develop agents that target specific factors of the coagulation process, 
which in turn may improve efficacy and increase the  therapeutic index. Factor Xa (FXa) is a 
primary target, as this factor plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_709243]. Inhibition of FXa is expected to exert 
anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects by [CONTACT_709290], thereby [CONTACT_387590] -mediated activation of the coagulation process, 
including fibrin formation and platelet activation.24 
Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been studied for treatment of AF in the setting of 
catheter ablation. They have shown to carry a comparable risk -benefit profile to that of 
warfarin.25,[ADDRESS_964345] roke, systemic embolism, and bleeding in patients with AF compared with 
warfarin,27 and reduce the risk of stroke a nd systemic embolism without increasing the risk of 
bleeding compared with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_709244] K antagonists are not suitable.24 
Considerable uncertainty exists about the optimal strategy for dosing NOAC agents around the 
time of an ablation procedure.  “Uninterrupted” warfarin has become the standard approach 
based on case series and on randomized study (BRUISE CONTROL) of a related procedure28-[ADDRESS_964346]  2016  HCRI  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 23 
Final Version 1.0 with increased bleeding, but holding two d oses was not. Randomized trials however, are testing 
an uninterrupted strategy.32 33  
With api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], the graph below illustrates the level of anticoagulation over time with twi ce daily 
dosing, which would be that of an “uninterrupted” strategy.  For an “interrupted” strategy, 
holding the dose in the morning of the ablation procedure, thus being between 12 -18 hours 
following a dose (if last taken at 8pm the night before) – the le vel of anticoagulation 
approximates that of rivaroxaban.  Which of these two approaches gives the best overall 
effectiveness for avoiding bleeding and thrombotic complications is unknown.34   
 
 
 
2.1 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Similar to other NOACs, api[INVESTIGATOR_709245] a risk -benefit profile that is comparable to 
that of warfarin in subjects with NVAF undergoing radiofrequency ablation. In this study, peri - 
and post -procedural treatment with api[INVESTIGATOR_709246] -related risk of 
thromboemboli c complications but with a decreased risk of bleeding compared with current peri - 
and post -procedure anticoagulation management strategies.  
Between the two dosing strategies, it is not known whether the uninterrupted or interrupted 
strategy of api[INVESTIGATOR_709247] l differ in their rates of clinically significant bleeding or thrombotic 
events. For possible benefits and risks – holding one dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_709248]; conversely, continuing api[INVESTIGATOR_9640] n might lead 

AEIOU Trial    
 Clinical Protocol No. CV 185-[ADDRESS_964347] difference in the level of anticoagulation, it is hypothesized that the rates of these 
bleeding and thrombotic events will be similar betwee n the two strategies.  
 
 
2.2 Research Hypothesis  
For the prospective, randomized cohort : 
Among subjects planned to undergo catheter ablation for treatment of NVAF, it is hypothesized 
that the incidence of thrombotic events and bleeding events will be similar between the two arms 
of the study (api[INVESTIGATOR_709249]. api[INVESTIGATOR_709250]). To assess this 
hypothesis, the primary efficacy and safety endpoint rates and the exact 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals of the primary efficacy an d safety endpoints for each api[INVESTIGATOR_199026] (and for both 
api[INVESTIGATOR_709251]) and a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval of the risk difference between 
the groups (calculated using the Wilson method) will be presented for api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] -treated subjects.  
 
Retro spective warfarin cohort : 
It is hypothesized that p eri- and post -procedural treatment with api[INVESTIGATOR_709252] a decreased risk of bleeding compared with current peri - and post -
procedure anticoagulation management s trategies  with warfarin . 
 
A tertiary research hypothesis is:  
The combined clinically significant bleeding and thrombotic event rate (and additionally the 
combined major bleeding/thrombotic event rates) with api[INVESTIGATOR_709253] - and post -procedural 
treatment (interrupted and uninterrupted combined) will be lower than the literature -based 
boundary of 8.7% at 1 month . To assess this hypothesis,  we will compare the 1 -sided 95% upper 
bound of the confidence interval of the rate of clinically significant bleeding and thrombotic 
events to the literature -based boundary. (If interrupted and uninterrupted api[INVESTIGATOR_709254]/thrombotic 
event rate, then this analysis may be carried out separately for interrupted and uninterrupted 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]).

versus interrupted) in the setting of NVAF ablation.  It will also assess the effectiveness of each 
strategy for api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (uninterrupted, interrupted) versus warfarin and both strategies for api[INVESTIGATOR_709256] (uninterrup ted plus interrupted)  versus warfarin .

3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
For the prospective, randomized cohort : to evaluate the efficacy and safety of api[INVESTIGATOR_709257]. interrupted therapy during the peri - and post -procedural period of 
catheter ablation.  
For the retrospective, warfarin cohort : to assess the efficacy and safety  of api[INVESTIGATOR_709258] (use of warfarin ).  Outcomes derived from the retrospective, warfarin 
cohort will be compared to that observed in the combined (both randomized arms) prospective 
cohort, and to that observed in each randomized arm of the prospective cohort (warfarin vs. 
uninterrupted apix aban; warfarin vs. interrupted api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]).

5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN , STUDY DESIGN AND  DURATION  
This is a p rospective, multicenter, randomized, open -label clinical trial. The study will compare 
2 arms:  uninterrupted vs. interrupted therapy with api[INVESTIGATOR_709259] ( NVAF).  
Simultaneously, a retrospective cohort of [ADDRESS_964357] will be documented. The outcomes 
in this group will be compared to the outcomes in the randomized, prospective cohort.   
 
5.1 Prospective, Randomized Cohort  
Subjects undergoing ablation  for NVAF will be screened for eligibility and those meeting all 
eligibility requirements will be enrolled. Subjects will be consented and enrolled at Visit 1. Pre-
procedural transesophageal echocardiography will be performed at the discretion of the 
inves tigator. Subjects will be treated with api[INVESTIGATOR_292928] ≥21 days prior to ablation; for subjects 
already being treated with api[INVESTIGATOR_292928] ≥21 days, it is not necessary to wait 21 days between 
Visit 1 and Visit 2. Eligible subjects will be randomized prior to th e procedure (Visit 2); 
randomization may take place on the day of the procedure or up to 3 days prior. Subjects not 
randomized will be considered screen failures . Api[INVESTIGATOR_709260] 5 mg b.i.d.; per product 
label, however, the dose will be 2.5 mg b.i.d.  in subjects with ≥2 of the following characteristics: 
age ≥80 years, body weight ≤60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL.  
It is anticipated that up to 360 subjects may be enrolled in order to evaluate a total of 300 
randomized subjects . Up to 20 sites in t he [LOCATION_002] (US) will participate.  Subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 peri -procedural treatment strategies (150 subjects per cohort):   
1. Uninterrupted treatment: administer the evening api[INVESTIGATOR_709261]; 
admini ster the morning api[INVESTIGATOR_709262]; administer heparin bolus 
before trans septal puncture to maintain a target activated clotting time [ACT] > 300 seconds; 
administer the evening api[INVESTIGATOR_709263]-procedural 
complications that necessitate withholding anticoagulation  for longer duration.  
2. Interrupted treatment: administer the evening api[INVESTIGATOR_709261]; do 
not administer the morning api[INVESTIGATOR_709264]; administer heparin bolus 
before trans septal puncture to maintain a target ACT > 300 seconds; administer the evening 
AEIOU Trial    
 Clinical Protocol No. CV 185-[ADDRESS_964358] procedure, until the end of the study. Study visits will be at screening/enrollment, 
pre-procedure/ discharge, and at [ADDRESS_964359] participation in the study will 
conclude at the follo w-up/end -of-study visit conducted at [ADDRESS_964360] -ablation .

5.2 Retrospective, Warfarin Cohort  
In addition, due to diverse definitions of the components of the primary endpoints in previous 
studies (e.g., clinically significant bleedings), a chart review of [ADDRESS_964364] for ≥ [ADDRESS_964365] -ablation procedure will 
be performed to assess the incidence of the adjudicated primary endpoints in the current clinical 
setting. Patient records f or warfarin -treated individuals who meet the applicable 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and who are matched 1:[ADDRESS_964366]  2016  HCRI  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 23 
Final Version 1.0 cohort for age (+/ - 5 years), gender and AF type ( paroxysmal vs. persistent ), will be identified. 
Sites  will document key demographic and outcome variables. This review will be performed in a 
blinded manner such that site personnel are blinded to the outcome of each retrospective subject 
during the subject selection process. Only pre -existing data will be c ollected for the analysis of 
this cohort.  
 
6. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  AND CONSIDERATIONS  
6.[ADDRESS_964367] 2 -sided 95% 
confidence intervals of the primary effica cy and safety endpoints for each api[INVESTIGATOR_199026] (and 
for both api[INVESTIGATOR_709251]) and a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval of the risk difference 
between the api[INVESTIGATOR_334415] (calculated using the Wilson method) will be displayed for 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] -treated sub jects. It is noted that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_709265].   
The event rate for clinically significant bleeding from the literature is difficult to obtain with the 
protocol specified definition.  Recent registries show rates o f major bleeding of approximately 
2%, and minor bleeding of 6 -12%.  Minor bleeding has not been consistently defined and is 
difficult to compare across trials. To be conservative, we adopted an event rate of 4% for 
warfarin.  Although in the ARISTOTLE tria l comparing warfarin and api[INVESTIGATOR_709266] (not undergoing ablation) the bleeding rate was 20 -30% lower with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], we have 
conservatively assumed that the rate will be the same.  As such, the assumed rate of clinically 
significant bleeding f or api[INVESTIGATOR_34212] 4.0%.  
For the primary analyses on the primary safety endpoint, assuming an evaluable  sample size of 
150 per randomized group and an event rate of 4.0% for each of the interrupted and 
uninterrupted api[INVESTIGATOR_334415], the width of the confidenc e interval for the risk difference 
between randomized groups will be 10% (i.e., the 95% CI of the risk difference will be -5% to 
+5%).  
In addition, the secondary analysis of the efficacy and safety endpoints will compare the rates 
(from randomization to [ADDRESS_964368] -ablation) of clinically significant bleeding events, and of 
thrombotic events observed in the api[INVESTIGATOR_709267], compared to that 
observed in the matched, retrospective warfarin cohort who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
These analyses will be performed on the evaluable population.  
For the secondary analyses of comparing api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (both interrupted and uninterrupted 
combined) to warfarin, assuming an evaluable sample size of 300 patients for each of api[INVESTIGATOR_709268] c ohorts and a clinically significant bleeding event rate of 4% for each of these two 
AEIOU Trial    
 Clinical Protocol No. CV 185-[ADDRESS_964369]  2016  HCRI  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 23 
Final Version 1.0 groups, the width of the confidence interval for the risk difference between groups will be 6.7%. 
(i.e., the 95% CI of the risk difference to be -3.35% to +3.35%).  
Sample s ize justification  
The following assumptions were used for the sample size calculations:  
• Assessment is that the incidence of a composite of clinically significant bleeding and thrombotic 
events  (and composite of major bleeding and thrombotic events)  in the setting of api[INVESTIGATOR_709269] (interrupted and uninterrupted combined) peri - and post -ablation  for NVAF meets the 
literature -based boundary using a [ADDRESS_964370] based on the binomial distribution.  
• The true api[INVESTIGATOR_709270] 1 month is as sumed to be 5.0%.  
• Type I error (α) = 0.05 (1 -sided).  
• Power of 80%.  
A sample size of 300 api[INVESTIGATOR_709271], randomized cohort  provides 80% 
power to meet this boundary, with the upper bound of the 1 -sided 95% confidence interval of the 
event rate in the study cohort not exceeding 8.7%. It is estimated that up to 360 subjects will be 
enrolled to randomize 300 subjects.  
 
 
6.2     Analysis Populations  
The following populations will be used for data analyses:  
 
6.2.1 Intention -to-Treat (ITT)  
All subjects randomized to either interrupted or uninterrupted api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
6.2.2 Evaluable  
The subset of the ITT population who underwent an index ablation procedure and were followed 
through 1 month (30 days minus an allowable 3 -day visit window) post –index procedure  or who 
experienced a primary endpoint prior to the 1 month follow -up visit . This is the primary analysis 
population for the primary endpoint and for efficacy in general. Subjects are analyzed under the 
treatment to which they were randomized.  
6.2.3 Safety  
All subjects receiving randomized study treatment. This is the primary analysis population for 
safety. Subjects are analyzed under the treatment received.  
6.2.4 Historical Control  
The retrospective cohort of patient records from 300 warfarin -treated individuals who underwent 
catheter ablation for NVAF in the enrolling centers on or after September 1, 2013 and who were 
matched for age, gender and type of AF ( paroxysmal vs. persistent ) to the [ADDRESS_964371] data listings will be generated using 
SAS® Version 9. 4 or SAS EG Version 6.1  (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, United 
States of America).  A subject who withdraws prior to the last planned observation will be 
included in the analyses up to the time of withdrawal.   
Continuous variables will be summari zed using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, minimum, and maximum values). Unless otherwise specified, the mean and 
median for a continuous variable will be presented to [ADDRESS_964372] than the original 
(raw) values and the SD will be presented to 2 more decimal places than the original values. The 
minimum and maximum will be presented to the same number of decimal places as the original 
values.  
Categorical variables will be reported as frequency counts (including number missing) and the 
percentage of subjects in corresponding categories. Unless otherwise stated, percentage 
calculations will be based on the number of subjects with non -missing data in each of the 
treatment groups. Percentages will be presented to [ADDRESS_964373] Disposition  
A tabulation of the number and percent of subjects  will be presented for the following categories  
for each randomized treatment group : 
• Screened  
• Screen Failure  (Percentages are based on number of Screened subjects)  
• Randomization  (Percentages are based on number of Screened subjects)   
• Evaluable (Percentages are based on number of Randomized subjects)  
• Number discontinued overall and by [CONTACT_709291] (Percentages are based 
on number of Randomized subjects)

Final Version 1.0 6.5 Demography , Baseline Characteristics  and Medical History  
Descriptive statistics of demographic , baseline characteristics  (age,  gender, race,  ethnicity,  
height , weight ) and medical history will be presented for interrupted api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], uninterrupted 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], and both api[INVESTIGATOR_709251].  Similar descriptive statistics and analyses will be 
presented for the retrospective warfarin group. Groups (api[INVESTIGATOR_709272]; a pi[INVESTIGATOR_709273]) will be compared on baseline variables using [ADDRESS_964375] for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_964376] 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals of the primary endpoint for each api[INVESTIGATOR_199026] (and for bo th api[INVESTIGATOR_709274]) and a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval of the risk difference between the groups 
(calculated using the Wilson method) will be presented for api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] -treated subjects. It is noted 
that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_709275].  
For the ITT analysis set, there may be missing data on the primary efficacy endpoint due to 
premature withdrawals prior to [ADDRESS_964377] –index procedure. As a supportive analysis to assess 
the sensitivity of results to missing data, ana lyses on the ITT population will incorporate the 
following approach: Kaplan -Meier rate estimates and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals of the 
Kaplan -Meier estimates and of the difference between Kaplan -Meier estimates will be presented 
for the same api[INVESTIGATOR_709276]. All ITT subjects will be included in the calculation of the 
Kaplan -Meier rates; subjects not experiencing the event will be censored at the end of the 1 -
month follow -up or time of their premature withdrawal, whichever is earlier.  
 
To assess con sistency of results across study sites, logistic  regression on the primary endpoint 
with the independent variables of treatment, site and treatment -by-site interaction will be carried 
out on the evaluable analysis set .  Significance of the treatment -by-site interaction will be 
assessed at the 0.15 level of significance.  A non -significant interaction or a significant 
interaction that is only quantitative in nature will support the pooling of patients across study 
sites for the primary efficacy analysis.  Sites with less than 10 patients will be pooled with other 
sites by [CONTACT_1617]; this will be done befor e the blind is broken.

Final Version 1.0 6.6.3 Additional  Secondary Analyses  
The above -mentioned additional secondary endpoints will be assessed and analyzed in a similar 
manner as the primary and major secondary efficacy endpoints (however, Kaplan -Meier 
estimates will not be calculated for in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709277], and subjects included in the calculation 
of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709278] 1 month of follow -up). 
 
 
6.7 Safety Analyses  
Analyses on the primary safety endpoint  (the incidence of clinically significant bleeding assessed 
from the time of randomization through [ADDRESS_964379] –catheter ablation ) will be carried out in a 
similar manner as for the primary efficacy endpoint , including the assessment of the treatment -
by-center interaction .   
The following additional safety analyses will be carried out on the safety population:  
The number and percentage of subjects with treatm ent emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be 
presented by [CONTACT_709292][INVESTIGATOR_199026] 
(uninterrupted and interrupted) and both api[INVESTIGATOR_709251]. A TEAE is defined as an 
AE starting or worsening in severity on  or after start of study treatment. These analyses will be 
repeated for serious TEAEs and for TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation from the study.  
 
6.8 Other Analyses  
1. As a tertiary analysis, the combined thrombotic/bleeding rate for both api[INVESTIGATOR_709279] a rate derived from the literature. Based on the above -mentioned meta -
analysis, the expectation for the true combined thrombotic/bleeding en dpoint rate at 1 month is 
5.0% for api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]. However, because strict equality cannot be assessed statistically, this study 
will assess if the 1 -month rate of clinically significant bleeding and thrombotic events (and 
additionally of the composite of major bleeding and thrombotic events) falls below 8.7% when 
both treatment arms are combined. Specifically, this tertiary analysis will assess the ability of 
api[INVESTIGATOR_709280] a literature -based boundary of 8.7%, which is 
an ab solute increase of 3.7% over the expected rate of 5.0% obtained from the meta -analysis. In 
other words, this analysis will test the following null and alternative hypotheses:  
   H0: π ≥ 0.087 (or 8.7%)  
   H1: π < 0.087 (or 8.7%)  
where π is the true (unknow n) api[INVESTIGATOR_709281].  
The null hypotheses will be tested using all evaluable api[INVESTIGATOR_709282] (uninterrupted and 
interrupted groups combined) at a [ADDRESS_964380] 95% confidence interval of the endpoint 
rate will be presented and the upper bound will be compared to 8.7%. For completeness, a [ADDRESS_964381] 90% confidence interval will also be presented.  Note that, prior to carrying out this 
analysis , the comparability between api[INVESTIGATOR_709283]/bleeding endpoint will 
be assessed using a 2 -sided 95% Wilson confidence interval.  If the confidence interval does not 
AEIOU Trial    
 Clinical Protocol No. CV 185-[ADDRESS_964382] exists. A P value <0.15 will not necessarily preclude the sites from being poole d for 
the final analysis, but will require further inspection (e.g., endpoint results by [CONTACT_3725]) to assess if 
there is a concern about lack of site poolability.    
In addition, logistic regression will be used to assess consistency of the interrupted vs. 
uninterrupted api[INVESTIGATOR_709284], using a logistic regression model with effects for 
treatment type (interrupted or uninterrupted), site and the treatment type -by-site interaction.  The 
interaction term will be assessed using a 0.[ADDRESS_964383] 95% confidence intervals of the primary and major secondary 
endpoints will be presented by [CONTACT_9674][INVESTIGATOR_709285]:  
a. Age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years).  
b. CHA 2DS 2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke or 
transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism,  vascular disease, age, sex category) score  (< 
median, ≥ median).  
c. HAS -BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or 
predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol) bleeding risk scores 
(< median, ≥ median).  
d. Baseline antiplatelet therap y vs. no antiplatelet therapy.  
e. Baseline anticoagulation therapy (subjects who are anticoagulation -naïve versus subjects on 
vitamin K antagonists versus subjects on novel oral anticoagulants).  
f. Subjects with ≥2 of the following characteristics: age ≥80 years , body weight ≤60 kg, or serum 
creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL.  
g. Api[INVESTIGATOR_292956].  
The purpose of this analysis is to assess consistency of primary and major secondary endpoint 
rates across the various subgroups  
 
6.9 Addition Analysis: Comparing Prospective Api[INVESTIGATOR_709286] (uninterrupted and interrupted groups 
combined) will be compared with a retrospectively -matched warfarin control gro up. The control 
group is comprised of patient records from warfarin -treated individuals (retrospective) who meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, including having undergone ablation for NVAF in the enrolling 
centers on or after September 1, [ADDRESS_964384] for 
≥ [ADDRESS_964385] -ablation procedure, and who meet the other inclusion/exclusion criteria including

Final Version 1.0 matched for age, gender and type of AF ( paroxysmal vs. persistent ). For the warfarin group, 
retrospective chart rev iew will be performed to assess the incidence of the primary endpoint.  
This analysis will compare the [ADDRESS_964387] of the study in which the site 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_709287]. Failure to comply with and/or inability to meet FDA regulations may jeopardize 
further participation of the Investigator or Investigative Center in this and future clinical studies.  
 
A summary of major and minor protocol deviations for all ITT and evaluable  populations  will be 
presented for each api[INVESTIGATOR_199026]. Subjects will be counted once within each deviation category.  
 
6.11 Concomitant Medication  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
dictionary. Incidence (nu mber and percent of subjects reporting the medication at least once 
during the study) will be summarized for all concomitant medications. All verbatim descriptions 
and coded terms will be listed for all non -study medications.

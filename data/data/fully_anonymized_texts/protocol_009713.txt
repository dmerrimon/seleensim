Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 5 1 Objectives and Hypotheses  
 
1.1 Objectives:  
1.1.1  Primary Endpoint 1: To determine the overall response rate at the end of 2 
cycles of therapy with rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib in patients with high risk newly diagnosed non-GCB DLBCL  
1.1.2  Primary Endpoint 2: To determine the complete response rate at  the end of 6 
cycles of therapy with rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib combined with chemotherapy  (CHOP or EPOCH)  in patients with high risk newly diagnosed  
non-GCB DLBCL  
1.1.3  Secondary Endpoint  1: To determine the overall response rate, landmark 
survival outcomes (progression free and overall survival), and safety of 
lenalidomide  and ibrutinib with chemotherapy  (CHOP or EPOCH)  in patients 
with high risk newly diagnosed non-GCB DLBCL.  
1.1.4  Secondary Endpoint 2: To evaluate descriptively the complete response rat e 
in RLI -CHOP and in RLI -EPOCH . 
1.1.5  Exploratory objectives: To evaluate the baseline and therapy induced changes in the profile of mutations, gene expression, minimal residual disease clonotype levels, immune cell subsets, and tumor protein expression 
in tumor biopsy and blood samples in pat ients with high risk newly diagnosed  
non-GCB DLBCL.  
 
1.2 Hypotheses:  
1.2.1  The combination of rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib alone will show a 
high overall response rate in newly diagnosed non -GCB  DLBCL, higher than 
single -agent ibrutinib, lenalidomide, or r ituximab ORR in patients with 
relapsed DLBCL  
1.2.2  Response- associated characteristics will be identified from analysis of biopsy 
material and peripheral blood from baseline and on- therapy time points, for 
future validation and potential patient selection.  
  
Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 6 2 Background  
2.1 Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma:  
Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy 
with ~30,000 new cases in the US annually, is uniformly treated with a combination 
(CHOP) which remains essentially unchanged over the past 30+ years. (1-3) 
Knowledge of DLBCL biology has made significant advances, including the definition of two distinct subtypes with unique gene expression programs, (4-6) genomic 
abnormalities, (7) microRNA profiles, (8-10) signaling pathways, (11-13) and response 
to targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. (14, 15)  
 
In 1976, McKelvey et al demonstrated a 67% complete response (CR) rate and 
~70% 1- year overall survival (OS) in “diffuse lymphoma” with CHOP 
chemotherapy. (1) Multiple attempts to improve upon the CHOP regimen have 
yielded disappointing results, including the American Intergroup Trial which 
evaluated three more aggressive regimens (m -BACOD, ProMACE- CytaBOM, and 
MACOP -B) versus CHOP. (16) The trial found that the four regimens were 
essentially equivalent in efficacy, with CHOP achieving a 54% 3- year disease- free 
survival (DFS). The CHOP regimen had moderately lower toxicity rates than the other regimens, and has thus remained the standard of care.  
 
In 1998, rituximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody targeting surface CD20, was reported to have efficacy in relapsing or refractory aggressive 
lymphomas. Coiffier et al. reported a 37% overall response rate (ORR) with single-
agent rituximab, but the duration of clinical benefit was brief. (17) With significant 
activity in relapsed or refractory patients, r ituximab was moved to clinical trials in 
frontline therapy. In a phase II clinical trial of rituximab plus CHOP (R -CHOP), 
published in 2001, Vose et al. reported an ORR of 94% in untreated DLBCL patients, including 15 of 16 patients with an International P rognostic Index (IPI) 
score of 2 or higher. (18)  
 The IPI [CONTACT_832] a clinical prognostic system created from pre- treatment factors from 
patients with DLBCL treated with CHOP, including age, stage, performance status, number of extranodal sites, and lactate dehydrogenase. (19) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_223824], it has yet to be supplanted as a clinically relevant prognostic tool. In the era of R -CHOP, the IPI [INVESTIGATOR_223825]. The Revised IPI [INVESTIGATOR_223826] 3 or greater adverse clinical predictors achieve poor outcomes, with a 4 year progression free survival ( PFS) and OS of 53 and 55%, respectively  (Appendix 
B).(20) The striki ng similarity between PFS and OS for this group implies that of the 
47% of patients who have progressed in the first 4 years, less than 10% were still

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version [ADDRESS_269284] therapy of DLBCL is R -CHOP based 
on a consecutive series of clinical trials as detailed in section 2.1. The therapy of 
DLBCL has not been influenced to date by [CONTACT_223875][INVESTIGATOR_223827]. (3, 21) Patients with localized disease (either stage I or contiguous 
stage II) may be treated with either standard R -CHOP x 6 cycles, or R -CHOP x 3 
cycles followed by [CONTACT_223876], based upon a cooperative group 
study evaluating CHOP x 8 vs CHOP x 3 with radiation. (22) However, patients with 
high IPI [INVESTIGATOR_223828] -[ADDRESS_269285] increased chance of 
relapsing outside a radiation field, and thus may be offered R -CHOP x 6 cycles and 
involved field radiotherapy. For patients not appropriate for local therapy approaches (Stage II non- contiguous, or Stage III/ IV), R -CHOP x [ADDRESS_269286] 
approach. There is an ongoing randomized phase III  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]  clinical trial 
comparing the CHOP -variant regimen R -EPOCH against R -CHOP for newly 
diagnosed patients with DLBCL. The preliminary results show no difference of EFS between the two regimens  and will be presented at the American Society of 
Hematology (ASH) conference of 2016.  
 
2.3 Dose Adjusted Rituximab EPOCH  
R-EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin) is a 
CHOP -like regimen which employs infusional chemotherapy. The schedule for DA -
EPOCH includes infusional doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine over 4 days, followed by [CONTACT_223877] 5. The doses of these four chemotherapy drugs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_223829], essentially a pharmacodynamics biomarker. DA -EPOCH was designed to improve the therapeutic 
index of chemotherapy by [CONTACT_223878]. A prospective multi -institutional study of R- DA-EPOCH in 50 patients with previously 
untreated large B -cell lymphomas showed that highly proliferative tumors were 
sensitive to treatment, unlike CHOP -based treatments. (23) In previously untreated 
DLBCL, EPOCH (without rituximab) showed a complete response rate of 92%, and 70% of patients remained free of progression at the median follow up of 62 months. (23) Subsequent clinical trials have found that  response to R -DA-EPOCH 
(DA, dose adjusted) may be different in certain subsets of DLBCL. (24) A randomized 
phase III trial comparing R -CHOP with R- DA-EPOCH in untreated DLBCL pat ients 
Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 8 has recently completed accrual, and the highly anticipated results are expected in 
2015. This trial will include evaluation of the above- mentioned subsets to determine 
if there is truly a differential response.  
2.4 Cell of Origin subtypes:  
In 2000, [CONTACT_223923] et al described DLBCL as at least two unique subtypes, 
defined by [CONTACT_223879]. These subtypes, known as the activated B -cell 
(ABC) and germinal center B -cell (GCB) subtypes, are known to be as different from 
each other as  acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias. (25) The ABC DLBCL subtype 
is occasional ly referred to as “non- GCB DLBCL”, a historical term that originates 
from the concept that all DLBCL were presumed to originate from the germinal center. The currently available CLIA certified and clinically utilized methods of 
assigning cell of origin are largely immunohistochemically (IHC) based, which result 
in assignment into GCB and “non- GCB”, which is largely equivalent to the ABC 
subtype.( 26) For the remainder of this protocol, the terms “ABC DLBCL” and “non-
GCB DLBCL” will be considered interchangeable unless otherwise specified. The most prevalently utilized method is that of Hans et al (2004) in which samples are 
analyzed for expression levels of CD10, Bcl -6, and MUM1.  
 
Among the prominent differences are the utilization of B -cell-receptor, MyD88, and 
NF-kappaB signaling pathways combi ned with PRDM1 disruption in ABC- DLBCL. 
GCB -DLBCL has frequent alterations in epi[INVESTIGATOR_223830]2, CREBBP, and 
EP300. (11, 12, 27-30) These differences have subsequently been confirmed to have 
significant clinical relevance, with R- CHOP achieving 5- year OS rates in activated B -
cell (ABC) and germinal center B -cell subtypes (GCB) DLBCL of ~50% and ~70%, 
respectively.( 21) 
 A phase II study using bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in relapsed DLBCL 
patients confirmed the pathway -based prediction of efficacy restricted to ABC 
patients, when used in combination with a standard multi -drug regimen. (14) In 
addition, a recent phase I/II trial demonstrated that rituximab plus lenalidomide, an 
immunom odulatory agent, is dramatically more effective vs. the ABC subtype. (31) In 
previous trials, R -DA-EPOCH has shown excellent outcomes in GCB DLBCL, 
although ABC DLBCL remains poorly treated with ~4/10 patient suffering relapse in < 24 months (Figure 1).

Figure 1. ABC  (non-GCB analog)  vs GCB DLBCL subtypes time to progression 
when treated with dose adjusted R -EPOCH (adapted from ( 24)). 
2.5 PET/ CT Scans in lymphoma  
PET/CT scans are used in NHL to evaluate residual masses detected on CT after completion of chemotherapy, with the negative predictive values for outcome of 80% to 100%. (32, 33) Results from a PET scan after one cycle of chemotherapy were 
essentially equivalent to results from a PET scan obtained at the completion of chemotherapy in predicting PFS in NHL and HD. (34)  
Moskowitz et al evaluated the predictive value of an FDG PET in patients with 
high risk untreated DLBCL after 3 cycles of conventional chemotherapy. (35) Of the 
38 patients with a positive interim FDG PET, only 5 (13%) had biopsy -confirmed 
persistent disease. Interestingly, the patients with positive interim FDG PET and negative biopsy ha d no significant difference in long- term outcomes from patients 
with negative interim FDG PET (p=0.27). As a result of this important trial, the positive predictive value of an interim FDG PET is considered low enough that a 
biopsy for confirmation is mand atory prior to altering the treatment plan. Essentially, 
interim FDG PET scans have an excellent negative predictive value, however the 
positive predictive value is not clinically viable.  
2.6 Non-imaging based disease monitoring  
A novel technology (LymphoSIGHT, Sequenta) has been shown to allow a detection of a tumor -specific clonotype (DoC) in blood and to correlate with therapeutic 
response and identification of relapse prior to imaging findings. (36-38) This novel 
technology amplifies the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene segments from tumor biopsy DNA , which can allow detection of a tumor -specific clonotype (DoC) in blood, and to 

Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 10 correlate with therapeutic response and identification of relapse prior to imaging 
findings. (39) 
 
Genomic DNA from tumor is isolated using standard kits from Qiagen, and is 
subsequently amplified using locus -specific primer sets for all known alleles of 
germ line immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T- cell receptor (TCR) 
sequences. (36) The tumor -specific sequences identified at diagnosis are then used 
as a target to assess the presence of tumor -specific clonotype in follow- up samples. 
For quantitation, multiple sequencing reads (~10X coverage) are generated for each rearranged B cell in the reaction.  
 
To determine the absolute measure of the tumor -specific clonotype present in the 
follow- up sample, a known quantity of reference IgH sequence is added into the 
reaction and the associated sequencing reads are counted. The resulting number of 
reference IgH reads per sequence are then applied to the tumor -specific clonotype 
reads to obtain an absolute measure of the total tumor -specific clonotype in the 
reaction.  
 The tumor -specific clonotype reads and the absolute number of total leukoctyes in 
the reaction metrics can be combined to calculate a final tumor -specific clonotype 
measurement, which is the number of tumor -specific clonotype reads divided by [CONTACT_223880] i n the sample.  
 In addition to LymphoSIGHT, recent advances in detection of circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) have allowed for the possibility of “liquid biopsies”. (40) The detection of 
ctDNA is related to the release of DNA by [CONTACT_223881]/necrotic cells, and potentially by 
[CONTACT_223882]. Various methods have been employed to detect ctDNA, including the cancer personalized profiling by [CONTACT_223883] 
(CAPP- Seq). (41) The creation of CAPP -Seq was initially pi[INVESTIGATOR_223831] a multiphase bioinformatics approach to 
create a ‘selector’, consisting of biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides that target recurrently mutated gene regions. This approach identified a median 4 single 
nucleotide variations per patient with lung cancer, without modification of the 
selector for genomic aberrations found in any given individual patient’s tumor. Thus, this approach has the advantage of being “o ff the shelf”, meaning that it is broadly 
applicable.  
2.7 Targeted Therapy Opportunities in the ABC DLBCL subtype:  
ABC DLBCL requires constitutive activity of the targetable B -cell receptor and NF -κB 
pathways for survival. Recent work has demonstrated the subt ype-selective activity 
of lenalidomide in ABC DLBCL comes from inhibition of the expression of the 
Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 11 survival- critical transcription factors IRF4 and SPIB, which are not essential for other 
lymphoma subtypes (Figure 2, adapted from ( 42) ). Confirmation of these data co me 
from multiple clinical trials which demonstrate either significant single agent activity 
of lenalidomide in ABC DLBCL (ORR 53%) (15, 43) or equivalent activity in ABC and 
GCB DLBCL of the well tolerated combination of R -CHOP + lenalidomide (ORR 
~90%, CR ~90%). (44-46)  
 Not surprisin gly due to the reliance on BCR signaling, the same pattern of an 
impressive response rate in ABC DLBCL has been seen for ibrutinib, the first in 
class BTK inhibitor. The Phase I trial found an ORR of 22% in relapsed refractory DLBCL patients, but 40% in the non- GCB (similar to ABC) subtype achieved 
response. (47) The phase Ib trial of ibrutinib with RCHOP showed an ORR of 100% 
in patients with untreated B -cell lymphomas. (48) Additional data detailed in Section 
2.11 provide strong pre- clinical rationale for the combination of lenalidomide with 
ibrutinib (Figure 2, adapted from (42). Importantly, the three trials which have added 
lenalidomide to R -CHOP and the single trial which added ibrutinib to R -CHOP in 
DLBCL have found no synergistic toxicity. Investigators were able to dose escalate lenalidomide and ibrutinib to clinically active dose levels without adding toxicity beyond what is expected from R -CHOP alone.  
 Together, these data strongly suggest that lenalidomide and ibrutinib 1) have a  
strong rationale for use in non- GCB (ABC) DLBCL based on pre- clinical and clinical 
data, and 2) have been well tolerated when combined with standard immuno-chemotherapy. Randomized registration trials comparing R -CHOP with both R-
CHOP + lenalidomide and w ith R-CHOP + ibrutinib are ongoing.

2.8 Lenalidomide 
REVLIMID®  (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-angiogenic properties. Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality 
with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.  Revlimid® is also approved in 
combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least one prior therapy.   
Lenalidomide, an oral agent, is a thalidomide derivative that belongs to a new class 
of agents known as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Lenalidomide has clinical activity in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and has been shown to possess several immunomodulatory properties. In addition to its known effect on various cytokines, 
lenalidomide may affect the immune cellular component of the tumor 
microenvironment. Potential effects include inducing lymphocyte proliferation, increasing the production of IL-2/INF-g by [CONTACT_223884].  
The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3-(4-amino-1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -2H-isoindol-2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510]-2,

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular 
weight is 259.3. Lenalidomide is an off -white to pale- yellow solid powder. It is soluble 
in organic solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in organic solvents and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly 
lower in less acidic buffers, ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has 
an asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically active forms S( -) and R(+), 
and is prod uced as a racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero.  
2.8.1  Clinical Pharmacology:  
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  
Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines and increased 
the secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells.  Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in 
some but not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in 
inhibiting growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG -1 cells 
(human myeloblastic cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of 
cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX -2) but not COX -1 in vitro.

Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 14 proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-
regimen does not result in drug accumulati on. 
 
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated 
in the phase I studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to maximum blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg,  10mg, 25mg, and 50mg).  No plasma accumulation was observed with 
multiple daily dosing.  Plasma lenalidomide declined in a monophasic manner with elimination half -life ranging from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 
doses.  Peak and overall plasma concentrations were dose proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg (5).  Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 
57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
 
Metabolism and Excretion  
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy 
volunteers, approximately two- thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged 
through urinary excretion. The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and

2.8.3  Lenalidomide in Aggressive NHL  
Wiernik et al reported preliminary results of lenalidomide monotherapy in patients 
with relapsed or refractory non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Lenalidomide (25 mg/d) was 
administered on days 1 to 21 of a 28- day cycle and continued for 52 weeks as 
tolerated or until disease progression. Patients with various aggressive histologic subtypes (including diffuse large B -cell, follicular center cell, mantle cell, and

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 15 transformed NHL) were enrolled. Forty -one of the 50 patients were assessable for 
response. Clinical responses were observed in all lymphoma subtypes. The ORR 
was 34% (n = 14) including five patients with CR unconfirmed (CRu), with a median 
progression- free survival in patients achieving a CRu of more than 239 (> 191 to > 
373 days) days. (Witzig et al 2007) An ongoing multicenter clinical trial is further 
investigating clinical efficacy of single agent lenalidomide in patients with aggressive NHL.  
 Kaufman et al first reported the clinical efficacy of thalidomide combined with rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle- cell lymphoma (MCL). The ORR 
and CR rate in this study was 81% and 31%, respectively  with a median 
progression- free survival of 20.4 months. (Kaufman et al 2004) On the basis of these 
findings, a phase I clinical trial of lenalidomide (5 to 25 mg) in combination with rituximab was initiated for MCL. The MTD was 20 mg/d, 21 of 28 days. The  DLT was 
prolonged neutropenia. Thirteen of 15 patients were assessable and had a median 
of three  (range 1-4) prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Although there were no responses in the 10- and 
15-mg dose cohorts, five of six patients in the 20- mg cohort responded including a 
complete response. (Wang et al 2007) On the basis of the important single- agent 
activity of lenalidomide and bortezomib in MCL, CALGB is currently conducting a phase II trial of the combination of the two agents in patients with relapsed or 
refractory MC L. 
2.8.4  Clinical trials evaluating lenalidomide combined with R -CHOP in DLBCL  
Investigators from the Mayo Clinic conducted a phase II clinical trial which evaluated lenalidomide 25mg orally daily along with full dose R -CHOP (R2CHOP) in patients 
with previously untreated stage II – IV, CD20+ DLBCL. Lenalidomide was 
administered on days 1 – 10 of a 21 day cycle for a total of 6 cycles of therapy. (49) 
All patients received a pegfilgrastim [ADDRESS_269289] of care and at the 
discretion of the treating physician. In the 60 evaluable patients, 59 patients 
achieved a response to therapy (98%) with 48 achieving a complete response (80%). The median duration of response was not reached in the manuscript, with a median follow up of surviving patients of 23.5 months. The progression free survival 
was 70% at 12 months and 59% at 24 months, and the overall survival was 90% at 
12 months and 78% at 24 months. There was no difference identified between the cell of origin subtypes in the 2 year progression free survival or 2 year overall survival. However, the investigators compared the patients treated with R2CHOP 
with a matched historical cohort of patients treated with RCHOP and found that the

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 16 non-GCB subtype achieved superior outcomes with R2CHOP. The 2 year 
progression free survival in non- GCB patients treated with R2CHOP was 60% vs. 
28% in non- GCB patients treated with RCHOP. The 2 year overall survival in non-
GCB patients treated with R2CHOP was 83% vs. 46% in non- GCB patients treated 
with RCHOP (p<0.001).  
 
Therapy was well tolerated, with only one patient experiencing a toxic death on trial 
thought related to intestinal perforation due  to signific ant gut involvement with 
DLBCL responding to therapy. Two patients experienced a grade 4 non- hematologic 
toxicity (intra -abdominal hemorrhage, thrombosis), and other non- hematologic 
toxicities were generally grade 2 or less. Although neutropenia was common (Grade 
3: 13% and Grade 4: 75%), neutropenic fever was rare at 9%. The dose intensity was excellent, with 87% of cycles administered containing the full lenalidomide dosage.  
 
Investigators from the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi conducted the REAL07 phase II  
clinical trial which evaluated lenalidomide 15mg orally daily with full dose RCHOP in 
patients with previously untreated stage II – IV, CD20+ DLBCL or grade 3b FL who 
were aged 60- 80 years. Lenalidomide was administered on days 1 - 14 of a 21 day 
cycle fo r a total of 6 cycles of therapy. (50) All patients received prophylaxis for 
neutropenia with granulocyte colony -stimulating factors, for deep vein thrombosis 
with low- molecular -weight heparins,  and for Pneumocystis jirovecii infection with co-
trimoxazole or a pentamidine aerosol. Occult carriers of hepatitis B virus were given lamivudine. In the 49 evaluable patients, 45 achieved a response to therapy (92%); 
42 achieved a complete response (86%)  and 3 achieved a partial response (6%). At 
a median follow up of 28 months, the 2 year overall survival was 92% and 2 year 
progression free survival was 80%. Of the 32 patients with adequate tissue for cell of origin determination, 16 (50%) had GCB and 16  had non -GCB DLBCL. In the GCB 
patients, 14 (88%) achieved a response, with 13 (81%) achieving a complete response. In the non- GCB patients, 14 (88%) achieved a response, with all 
achieving a complete response. The 2 year progression free survival was 71% in the patients with GCB DLBCL, and 81% in the patients with non- GCB DLBCL. The 2 
year overall survival was 88% in the patients with GCB DLBCL, and 94% in the patients with non- GCB DLBCL.  
 Therapy was well tolerated, with hematologic toxicities appearing similar to the trial 
from the Mayo Clinic and no toxic deaths on trial reported. Although neutropenia was 
common (Grade 3: 14% and Grade 4: 55%), neutropenic fever was rare at 10%. The dose intensity was excellent, with a median dosage of lenalidomide of 94% of the planned dosage for the entire trial.

2.9 Ibrutinib 
Ibrutinib (PCI -[ZIP_CODE]; JNJ -54179060) is a first -in-class, potent, orally administered,  
covalently -binding, small molecule Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor currently 
being co- developed by [CONTACT_48824], LLC , and Pharmacyclics, Inc for 
the treatment of B -cell malignancies. Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA™) is approved for small 
lymph atic lymphoma for approved indications  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
who have received at least 1 prior therapy , as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL) patients who have received at least one prior therapy or have a deletion of 
17p, and Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. Ibrutinib and PCI -[ZIP_CODE] refer to the 
same molecule; hereafter, ibrutinib will be used.  For additional details, refer to 
appendix F.  Ibrutinib is not approved for large B -cell lymp homa and combination use 
of products not approved for indication.

Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 18  
 
Ibrutinib is 1- [(3R)-3- [4-amino -3-(4-phenoxyphenyl) -1H-pyrazolo[3,4- d] pyrimidin-1-
yl]-1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_33214]] -2-propen-1- one and has a molecular weight of 440.50 g/mole 
(anhydrous basis). Ibrutinib is a white to off -white crystalline solid. It has a single 
chiral center and is  the R -enantiomer. The investigational drug product, ibrutinib, is 
an oral formulation containing micronized ibrutinib.  
 
In vitro studies have shown that ibrutinib binds covalently to a cysteine residue (Cys -
481) in the BTK active site, leading to potent and irreversible inhibition of BTK 
enzymatic activity. (12) In cellular signal transduction assays with a B -cell lymphoma 
cell line, ibrutinib inhibited autophosphorylation of BTK, phosphorylation of BTK’s 
physiological substrate, phospholipase- C gamma (PLCγ), and phosphorylati on of a 
further downstream kinase, extracellular signal -regulated kinase. Ibrutinib inhibited 
the proliferation of cell lines derived from DLBCL patients with a median effective concentration of 1 or 2 nM.  
2.9.1  Ibrutinib Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism:  
In vitro preclinical data show that ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A. In 
healthy volunteers, co- administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, 
increased Cmax and AUC of ibrutinib by [ADDRESS_269291] 
ibrutinib dose evaluated in clinical trials was 12.5 mg/kg (actual doses of 840 – 1400 
mg) given for 28 days with single dose AUC values of 1445 ± 869 ng ⋅  hr/mL which 
is approximately 50% greater than steady state exposures seen at the highest indicated dose (560 m g). Guidance on conc omitant use of ibrutinib with CYP3A 
inhibitors or inducers is provided in Appendix E and F . 
 Ibrutinib is absorbed after oral administration with a median Tmax of 1 to 2 hours. Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg. The s teady -state AUC (mean 
± standard deviation) observed in patients at 560 mg is 953 ± 705 ng⋅ h/mL and in 

Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 19 patients at 420 mg is 680 ± 517 ng⋅ h/mL. Administration with food increased ibrutinib 
Cmax and AUC by [CONTACT_3450] 2 to 4- and 2- fold, respectively, com pared with 
administration of ibrutinib after overnight fasting.  
 
Reversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97.3% with no 
concentration dependence in the range of 50 to 1000 ng/mL. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vd,ss) was 683 L, and the apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vd,ss/F) was approximately [ZIP_CODE] L.  
 
Metabolism is the main route of elimination for ibrutinib. It is metabolized to several 
metabolites primarily by [CONTACT_9058] P450, CYP3A, and to a minor extent by [CONTACT_097]2D6. The active metabolite, PCI -[ZIP_CODE], is a dihydrodiol metabolite with 
inhibitory activity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than that of ibrutinib.  
 Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver. In a hepatic impairment trial, a single dose of 140 mg of ibrutinib  was administered in non- cancer subjects. Ibrutinib AUC increased 
2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8- fold, respectively, in subjects with mild (n=6), moderate (n=10) and 
severe (n=8) hepatic impairment relative to subjects with normal liver functi on. 
Ibrutinib Cmax increased 5.2- , 8.8- and 7.0- fold, respectively, in subjects with mild, 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment relative to subjects with normal liver function.  
 
2.9.2  Pharmacodynamics of Ibrutinib  
In patients with recurrent B -cell lymphoma > 90% occupancy of the BTK active site 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed up to 24 hours after ibrutinib 
doses of ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day (≥ 175 mg/day for average weight of 70 kg).

This is a completed, Phase 1, multicenter, open- label, dose escalation study in 66 
subjects with recurrent NHL. The objectives included studying the safety profile of ibrutinib, identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal dosin g 
schedule, and characterizing efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. A minimum of 6 subjects per cohort received 1 of 5 escalating dose levels of ibrutinib between 1.25 and 12.5 mg/kg for 28 consecutive days in a 35- day cycle, with the

based on the fluorescent probe assay. Two additional cohorts received a continuous 
ibrutinib dose of 8.3 mg/kg without a 7- day rest and a fixed continuous dose of 560 
mg/day.  
Full B TK occupancy was achieved with doses at ≥2.5 mg/kg/day; consequently, per 
protocol, 12.5 mg/kg/day was the highest dose cohort evaluated. There were 2 dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) (Grade 2 neutropenia [2.5 mg/kg/day] and Grade 3 
hypersensitivity [8.3 mg /kg/day]); these events occurred in different dose cohorts, 
with neither in the highest -dose nor a continuous dosing cohort. The MTD of ibrutinib 
in subjects with B -cell malignancies was not established in this study.  
Five of 15 subjects with DLBCL (33%) achieved objective responses, 2 CRs and 3 
partial responses (PRs). The median time on treatment was 8 weeks (range: 2 to 98 
weeks). Median PFS was 2.5 months (range: 0.7 to 4.6 months) and the median follow- up time was 3.5 months (range: 0.8 to 22.5 months) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study PCYC -1106- CA 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open- label, single -arm study in subjects with relapsed 
or refractory DLBCL. Subjects are enrolled and retrospectively assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts by [CONTACT_130334]: ABC versus GCB as per central GEP. All subject s have 
received a continuous fixed dose of ibrutinib 560 mg/day. The objectives include 
studying the efficacy of ibrutinib in DLBCL and the safety of this dosing regimen. The 
study has completed enrollment. Seventy subjects were enrolled with a median age of 63 years (range: 28 to 92 years) and a median of 3 prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (range: 1 to 7).  
Median time from diagnosis was 19 months. In a subset of samples, a comparison of 
the central IHC by [CONTACT_223886] P hase 
2 clinical study (ie, Sensation algorithm; 200 genes) was performed (unpublished 
data on file).55 Non- GCB by [CONTACT_223887], blinded to the GEP assignment and clinical 
data, had a 92% concordance (12/13) with GEP. For the 60 response evaluable 
subjects, the overall response rate (ORR) was 21.7% (13/60 subjects). Median PFS 
was 1.64 months (Table 3).55 In the ABC subtype, ORR was 40% (10/25 subjects; 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 21% to 61%), CR 8% (2/25 subjects), and PR 32% (8/25 subjects). Only 1 PR (1/19 subjects; 5.3%) was observed in the GCB subtype 
and none in unclassifiable cases. Thus, while the 2 subgroups were clinically not 
well balanced, ibrutinib showed less activity in the GCB DLBCL subtype (p=0.0126, Fisher’s exact test).

A post hoc analysis of pooled data from the DLBCL expansion cohort of Study 
PCYC -[ADDRESS_269293] of a prior 
response to chemotherapy on subsequent response to ibrutinib was assessed for all subjects with DLBCL and for subjects in the ABC DLBCL and non- ABC DLBCL 
subsets . More subjects in the ABC DLBCL subset who were chemo- sensitive had a 
response (11/14 subjects, 78.6%) compared with the chemo- sensitive non- ABC 
DLBCL subset (4/16 subjects, 25.0%). Fewer subjects with ABC DLBCL who were chemo- refractory (defined as failure to achieve a response to the last prior 
chemotherapy regimen) had a response (4/25 subjects, 16%), but the response was 
still favorable as compared with the chemo- refractory non- ABC DLBCL subset (0/25

subjects with chemo -sensitive DLBCL. Therefore use of ibrutinib in earlier lines of 
therapy and in the non -GCB subtype of DLBCL may have the greatest clinical effect.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study PCI -32765DBL1002  
This is a multicenter, dose- escalation and expansion study in subjects with newly 
diagnosed CD20- positive B -cell NHL including DLBCL, follicular lymphoma, and 
MCL. Thirty -three subjects have been enrolled in this study of whom [ADDRESS_269294] DLBCL; 18 subjects with newly diagnosed DLBCL were treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (ibrutinib 560 mg daily) in combination with R -CHOP.  
In the dose- escalation phase of this study, subjects were assigned to cohorts of 
increasing oral daily doses of ibrutinib 280 mg (n=7), 420 mg (n=4), and 560 mg (n=6) administered in combination with R -CHOP. A Study Evaluation Team (SET) 
reviewed all available data upon completion of the first cycle for all subjects at each dose cohort to determine DLTs. After the recommended Phase 2 dose was 
determined (560 mg), 16 subjects with newly diagnosed DLBCL were enrolled into 
the expansion cohort. Subjects are allowed to continue to receive ibrutinib and R -
CHOP up to a maximum of 6 cycles.  
In patients who received ≥1 dose of ibrutinib and R -CHOP (n = 32), 15 (46·9%) 
patients received full doses of R -CHOP. Single -dose reductions of vincristine (11/32; 
34·4% of patients) were most frequently reported, and one patient each (3%) had 
one or two dose reductions of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or prednisone. Additionally, four patients had a single ibrutinib dose withheld once.  
In the 32 evaluable patients, the ORR was 93.8%, and for individual ibrutinib doses of 280 mg, 420 mg, and 560 mg, the ORR was 85.7%, 100.0%, and 95.2%, respectively. The complete response rate for the pat ients who received ≥1 dose of 
ibrutinib + R -CHOP (n = 32) was 71.9%. Among the DLBCL patients (n = 23), the 
ORR was 95.7%. Of these 23 patients, 18 were treated at the recommended phase II dose of 560mg and all responded. The complete response rate at 560m g in 
DLBCL patients was 15/18 (83.3%), and the partial response rate was 3/18 (16.7%).  
Among the DLBCL patients, 13 had cell of origin subtype determined, of which 11 were evaluable; Seven with GCB subtype and four with non- GCB. The ORR for 
these 13 patients was 100.0%, regardless of subtype. Five patients with GCB subtype achieved a complete response (71.4%) and two had a partial response. All four patients with confirmed non- GCB subtype achieved a complete response.  
The pharmacokinetics of vincristine wer e evaluated and determined to not be 
impacted by [CONTACT_3252]- administration of ibrutinib. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of

2.9.4  Adverse events described in prior ibrutinib clinical trials  
There are reports of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with ibrutinib, both with or without thrombocytopenia in both monotherapy and combination clinical studies. The majority of these hemorrhagic adverse events were of Grade 1 or 2 in severity; those included contusion, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and petechiae. Hemorrhagic events of Grade 3 
or higher, including central nervous system hemorrhage of any grade severity, 
occurred in 3.4% (17/506) of subjects treated in monotherapy studies and in 3.1% (4/130) of subjects treated in combination therapy studies; none were reported in the healthy volunteer studies (N=100). In the extension study, PCYC -1103- CA, 2 
additional Grade 3 events associated with bleeding were reported (‘gastrointestinal haemorrhage’ and ‘haematotympanum’). Details of these events are provided in the Appendix F, Section [ADDRESS_269295] been observed with ibrutinib alone or in combination with other drugs. A single case of Stevens -Johnson Syndrome (SJS) was reported in 
a male subject with CLL treated with ibrutinib 420 mg/day. The subject was also receiving multiple concomitant medications known to  be associated with SJS. 
Subjects should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms suggestive of SJS.  
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock (fatal), urticaria, and 
angioedema have been reported.  
In non- randomized clinical trials, infections (including sepsis, bacterial, viral, or 
fungal infections) were observed in subjects with MCL (≥ Grade 3; 25.2%) and 
CLL/SLL (≥ Grade 3; 37.6%). Some of these infections have been associated with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9017]. Subjects should be monitored for fever and infections and 
appropriate anti -infective therapy should be instituted as indicated.

etoposide, prednisone, vincristi ne, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin)  and 
in R- CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine  and

US annually. CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) was first reported as therapy for DLBCL in 1976, when its molecular pathobiology was virtually unknown, and has changed only with the addition of the anti -CD20 
antibody rituximab (R). (1, 25) DLBCL is now known to be molecularly 
heterogeneous, largely by [CONTACT_223889] -of-origin (COO) distinction between germinal 
center B -cell (GCB) and activated B -cell (ABC) subt ypes. (4, 6, 7) Multiple 
vulnerabilities of each COO subtype are known, and corresponding inhibitors are now in clinical trials, but subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_223832]- of-care 
(SOC) therapy. (21, 51) Aside from R, there is no obvious mechanistic specificity of 
RCHOP for either COO subtype, but it remains the frontline SOC therapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_223833], development of targeted agents, and tools for molecular diagnosis. (21, 52) Justif ication for this disconnect is largely due 
to the relative efficacy of RCHOP, which achieves 5- year overall survival (OS) rates 
of ~50% and ~70% in ABC and GCB subtypes, respectively, but with significant toxicity.( 5, 53) Infusional etoposide (E) in R -DA-EPOCH may incrementally improve 
frontline DLBCL SOC efficacy, including in high- risk disease, (24, 54) but it further 
adds  to toxicity and perpetuates the practice of non- targeted, one-size- fits-all 
frontline SOC therapy for DLBCL.  
 
The aby[CONTACT_223890] (~10%) for the 10,[ADDRESS_269297] DLBCL- critical 
aberrancies. (20, 55, 56) However, improving frontline DLBCL therapy poses a 
particular challenge for the academic oncologist: how to develop new novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_223834]. (52) The standard 
“SOC+X” approach, in which X is a drug with single agent efficacy in relapsed DLBCL patients, has drawbacks including: 1) how to measure what X adds to an already -effective SOC therapy; 2) how to avoid potential antagonism between X, 
which may be highly effective alone, and SOC agents; and 3) how to test more than 
one novel agent simultaneously.  
 
Gene expression profiling (GEP) shows that the ABC DLBCL subtype has constitutive similarities to normal B cells activated by [CONTACT_223891] B -cell 
receptor (BCR). Among those similarities are high activity of the canonical NF -kB 
Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version [ADDRESS_269298], (11, 57, 58) required for survival of ABC  DLBCL ( Figure 2 ).(27) CARD11, 
required for NF -κB activation by [CONTACT_223892], has gain- of-function mutations 
(GOFM) in 10% of ABC DLBCL that can activate NF -κB independent of BCR 
signaling. In ABC DLBCL with wild type (WT) CARD11, mutations in the ITAM 
domain of the BCR subunits CD79A and CD79B, found in 24% of ABC DLBCL tumors, contribute to NF -κB activation by “chronic active BCR signaling”. (12) 
Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), a BCR signaling pathway mediator, is 
specifically toxic to CARD11 -WT ABC DLBCL cell lines. NF -κB activation in ABC 
DLBCL is further driven by a specific GOFM in MYD88, found in 30% of tumors, 
resulting in toll -like receptor (TLR) signaling .(28) In addition to pro- survival factors, 
MYD88 GOFM paradoxically drive production of interferon- β (INF -β), which would be 
toxic to ABC DLBCL if not suppressed by [CONTACT_223893] 4 (IRF4 or MUM1), an NF -κB-driven hallmark of ABC DLBCL. In addition to INF -β suppression, 
IRF4 further activates CARD11 to amplify NF -κB signaling. (42, 59) 
 
Lenalidomide partially reduces IRF4 expression in ABC DLBCL cell lines, producing 
a synthetically lethal type I interferon response. (42) Ibrutinib has significant activity 
against ABC DLBCL cell lines with chronic active BCR signaling. (12) When ibrutinib 
is combined with lenalidomide, IRF4 expression is completely suppressed, resulting 
in profound synergy in ABC DLBCL cell lines. (42) 
 
In addition to affecting lymphoma cells directly, lenalidomide and ibrutinib both 
modulate immune responses. In MM, CLL, and follicular lymphoma (FL), 
lenalidomide reverses immunosuppression of T cells by [CONTACT_20405]. (60-62) 
Lenalidomide increases expression of T cell co- stimulatory molecules, T cell 
activating cytokines, and the number of cytotoxic T cells in MM patient samples. In indolent lymphomas including FL, we found that R -lenalidomide activated many 
different immun e cell subsets, including T  and natur al killer cells, and enhanced 
tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells .(63, 64) In addition to its irreversible BTK inhibition, 
ibrutinib also inhibits IL2- inducible kinase (ITK), which drives a shift towards an 
antitumor Th1- dominant response, and reduces a tumor -promoting Th2 
response. (65) In unpublished GEP studies, our group has also found that ibrutinib 
reduces expression of co -inhibitory receptors, most likely by T cells, in the blood of 
CLL patients. The relationship of these data to therapeutic immunomodulation in DLBCL is unknown; however, loss or aberrant expression of β2M and CD58, critical 
for tumor immuno- surveillance by T cells, is common in DLBCL and may correlate 
with immune -mediated response. (66) 
 
Clinical studies of lenalidomide and ibrutinib in ABC DLBCL:  Lenalidomide and 
ibrutinib have both shown promising efficacy and tolerability as single agents and in 
Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 26 combination with chemotherapy in relapsed and frontline DLBCL, with increased 
activity in the ABC subtype   
(Table  2,(15, 47-50)). In phase I trials in combination with RCHOP, both drugs were 
escalated to their single- agent maximum tolerated doses (MTD) without increased 
toxicity, and both lenalidomide and ibrutinib are now being evaluated in separate “RCHOP+X” trials against placebo aiming for FDA approval in ABC DLBCL. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 
a strong pre- clinical rationale for use of these promising agents, no trial has 
examined this combination in untreated ABC DLBCL patients prior to the current 
proposal.  
 
In relapsed ABC DLBCL, mutations (M) in BCR and MYD88 pathway mediators 
correlate with clinical responses to ibrutinib ( Table 3, (67)). Patients with CARD11 -M 
(distal to BTK from BCR) had no response to ibrutinib in a phase II trial, matching ABC DLBCL cell line -based predictions, (12) suggesting the need to target 
downstream NF -κB drivers. (47, 67) In CLL, BTK and PLC γ2 mutations result in 
acquired resistance to ibrutinib, though their relevance in DLBCL is unknown. (68) 
Resistance to lenalidomide in DLBCL is not well characterized, but in MM, which shares many GEP features with ABC DLBCL, it can be driven by [CONTACT_223894]/β-catenin signaling pathway. (69)  
 
Based upon the above data, the below phase Ib/II clinical trial of rituximab, 

Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma  
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 27 lenalidomide, and ibrutinib (RLI), combined with CHOP or EPOCH in patients with 
untreated DLBCL will be conducted. The phase II trial will start with RLI alone prior to the use of chemotherapy (“Smart Start”) for ≤2 cycles, followed by [CONTACT_223895]-EPOCH. The “Smart Start” portion will be restricted to ABC DLBCL 
due to the compelling evidence from our group and others that RLI efficacy is expected to have subtype specificity. 
 
DLBCL is clinically aggressive, but most frontline patients do not require immediate cytoreduction, and thus the Smart Start trial is feasible. The effect of innovative non-cytotoxic RLI alone can be assessed on primary tumor cells in vivo, n ot only 
because it will not be given with confounding chemotherapy, but also because its 
efficacy may be greater without the immuno- suppressive effects of chemotherapy. 
The Smart Start trial, a first in frontline DLBCL therapy, will allow correlation of th e 
efficacy of RLI alone with baseline and RLI -mediated features of the tumor and 
immune system, which may identify factors that could be used to understand and predict responses to RLI in future trials. New therapeutic approaches are measured 
by [CONTACT_223896], but also by [CONTACT_223897], A recent phase II trial showed that R -
lenalidomide had efficacy comparable to historical RCHOP controls as frontline therapy for FL, but with less toxicity. (64) While complete avoidance of cytotoxic 
therapy for DLBCL is not currently an option, the current trial will take a necessary first step toward that as a future possibility, at least for some identifiable patients.  
 
The Smart Start trial will demonstrate that novel drugs can be tested in the frontline setting, where they have the greatest chance of efficacy, (70) without denying access 
to the curative potential of SOC therapy. This trial may result in a needed paradigm shift in DLBCL therapy: 1) providing support for future trials comparing targeted therapy combinations vs. chemotherapy; 2) establishing RLI as a potential backbone for testing future combinations with additional targeted agents, possibly in an 
adaptively randomized context; and 3) stratifying treatment according to toxic ity 
concerns or a high likelihood of a response to RLI therapy.

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 28 3 Study Design and Rationale  
3.1 Study Design:  
This will be a single -center, open label, phase II clinical trial to determine the 
efficacy and safety of rituximab, lenalidomide, ibrutinib, and chemotherapy (R -
CHOP or R- DA-EPOCH)  in patients with newly diagnosed high risk DLBCL. The 
treating physicians  will have discretion to choose either R -CHOP of R -DA-
EPOCH as backbone  chemotherapy , in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_223835]. 
 The feasibility of administrating lenalidomide and ibrutinib in combination with 
rituximab with chemotherapy ( DA-EPOCH ) and the MTD have been previously 
determined in the PCYC -1124- CA clinical trial, conducted in patients with 
relapsed DLBCL . In this ongoing Phase 1b/2, open- label, non- randomized 
multicenter study, the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib and lenalidomide in combi nation with R- DA-EPOCH  are being evaluated in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory Diffus e Large B -cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) . A standard 3+3 
design was employed in Part 1 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 
which has been determined to be 560mg by [CONTACT_34048], and the MTD of 
lenalidomide was 25mg by [CONTACT_34048]. The preliminary data from the trial was 
presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (abstract 1527). In the dose escalation portion of the trial, no MTD was identi fied. 
Dose escalation was completed through the maximum dosing level. One DLT of 
diffuse alveolar damage was seen at the highest dose of lenalidomide tested. In 
this trial, the g rade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 14 (93%) patients. The 
most common grade ≥3 AEs ( which occurred  in >20% of patients) were anemia 
(60%), febrile neutropenia (47%), leukopenia (40%), neutropenia (40%), 
thrombocytopenia (40%), hypokalemia (40%), and hypotension (33%), which are 
considered generally in line with what would be expected from EPOCH chemotherapy alone. Serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 14 patients (93%) including 2 cases (13%) of grade 2 atrial fibrillation.   
Regarding the efficacy in this heavily pretreated population, i n the 10 response 
evaluable patients (with at least one post -baseline radiological assessment), 2 
patients had complete response (CR), 3 had partial response (PR), [ADDRESS_269299] response of stable disease, and 3 had progressive disease; 4 (67%) of 
6 response evaluable non- GCB patients ac hieved objective response (CR/PR). 
Three patients continue treatment, 2 patients completed the protocol -specified 
treatment, and 10 patients discontinued treatment. Reasons for treatment

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 29 discontinuation included AEs (n=3), progressive disease (n=3), stem c ell 
transplant after achieving CR/PR (n=2), disease worsening (n=1), and death 
(n=1)  
 As R -DA-EPOCH is more likely to result in toxicities than RCHOP, and because 
all of the drugs included in RCHOP are included in R -DA-EPOCH, we think it is 
appropriate to extrapolate the above data with R -DA-EPOCH to include R-
CHOP. As mentioned in Section 2.11 , the combination of RCHOP with ibrutinib 
and with lenalidomide has already been established as safe, and both drugs were increased to their single agent maximum dose without increased toxicity.   
Based upon these results, we will utilize the previously determined MTD to 
evaluate  efficacy of the rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib (“Smart Start”) for 
up to two cycles prior to start of chemotherapy , followed by [CONTACT_223898], lenalidomide, ibrutinib, and chemotherapy (R -CHOP or DA -EPOCH ) in 
patients with high risk non-GCB  DLBCL.  
3.2 Rationale of Study Design:  
The phase II clinical trial is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of 
rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib alone and combined with chemotherapy . 
 
Although the study design is novel for patients with untreated DLBCL, it has been utilized in previous clinical trials. As the “Smart Start” component of clinical trial 
will be given prior to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients who have 
confirmed disease progression may start chemotherapy at any time during the 
first 2 cycles of “Smart Start” therapy, previously demonstrated to be tolerable in the PCYC -1124- CA trial.  
 This study design will allow for evaluation of the efficacy of both rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib without chemotherapy for up to two c ycles and of 
rituximab, lenalidomide, ibrutinib combined with chemotherapy  for six cycles.

5.1 Smart Start:  
Patients will begin therapy on this clinical trial with the “Smart Start” portion of the 
trial. The Smart Start portion of the trial will be defined as shown in Table 4.

Ibrutinib  560mg  PO Daily  1-21 
Lenalidomide  25mg  PO Daily  1-10 
 The dose of lenalidomide and ibrutinib in the Smart Start portion of the trial will 
be based on the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) determined in the PCYC -
1124- CA clinical trial. Patients may decrease lenalidomide and ibrutinib (Table 9 ) 
if significant toxicities  occur (as defined in Section 5.3.1) . 
 Rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib will all start on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle in 
the Smart Start portion of the trial , and will be dosed for  1 day (Rituximab),  10 
days (lenalidomide) and continuously  (ibrutinib) for up to two cycles of therapy. 
The ibrutinib and lenalidomide capsules are to be taken around the same time 
each day with approximately 240 mL of water (ie, 8 ounces). The capsules 
should be swallowed whole and should not be opened, broken, or chewed.  A 
cycle of  therapy is defined as 21 days +/ - 72 hours for holidays or other 
scheduling issues that will not allow the patient t o be dosed exactly on schedule. 
After two cycles of Smart Start, or if disease progression is identified prior to the end of two cycle of S mart Start (as defined in Sections 6.3 and 7.1), all patients 
will start therapy with rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib combined with CHOP 
or DA-EPOCH chemotherapy as defined in Section 5.2.  
 
As defined in Section 9, if the response rate in the Smart  Start portion of the trial 
does not meet specified targets, the Smart Start portion of the trial may be closed prior to the completion of the trial. If so, all patients would start therapy with rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib combined with chemotherapy as defined in Section 5.2 as their initial cycle of therapy.  
 At the end of each cycle of the Smart Start portion of the trial, patients will bring their pi[INVESTIGATOR_223838].

of cycle 1 to avoid any possibility of bias favoring either chemotherapy regimen (e.g., selection of R -CHOP in patients who achieve a CR to RLI, or selection of 
R-DA-EPOCH in patients with stable disease after RLI).  
 As R -DA-EPOCH is considered to be equally effective as R -CHOP in treating 
newly diagnosed DLBCL based upon the phase III trial reported at the ASH 2016 meeting ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), these chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_223839].   
 After the Smart Start portion of the trial, patients will start therapy with rituximab,

 Lenalidomide and Ibrutinib will both start on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle along with 
R-EPOCH  or R -CHOP , and will be dosed for 10 days (lenalidomide) and 
continuously for the six cycles of therapy (ibrutinib), respectively.  If it is identified 
that dose reductions are required in ≥ [ADDRESS_269306] 10 patients, all subsequent 
patients would start at dose level - 1. If dose reductions are required in ≥ [ADDRESS_269307] 10 patients at dose level - 1, all subsequent patients would start at dose level 
-2. If dose reductions are required in ≥ [ADDRESS_269308] 10 patients at dose level - 2,

Based upon information available as of July 2018 from the DBL3001  trial 
(PHOENIX) , a Janssen- sponsored, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled 
phase 3 study  of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R -CHOP) versus placebo in

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 38 combination with R -CHOP, in subjects with newly diagnosed non- germinal center 
b-cell subtype of diffus e large B -cell lymphoma  (DLBCL), the protocol is being 
modified for patients ≥65 years of age. When a patient age ≥65 is enrolled on 
study, they will receive  a maximum dose of  420mg of ibrutinib when administered 
in combination with chemotherapy.  
 
For any patient enrolled on this study who is >=65 years of age and still on active 
therapy at the time of IRB approval of this amendment, they will receive ibrutinib 420mg for all subsequent cycles of therapy when combined with chemotherapy.  
 
5.3.1  Dose Reduction plan for lenalidomide and ibrutinib: 
 
Relevant toxicities  for the adjustment of lenalidomide and ibrutinib will be defined 
as any toxicity during either the smart start period and the [ADDRESS_269309] possibly related to study treatment:  
1. Any grade 3 or higher non- hematological toxicity possibly related to study 
medications and not controlled by [CONTACT_216203] e medications  per National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0  
excluding grade 3 rash that resolves to < Grade 2 within 10 days with systemic corticosteroid treatment, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, fever without neutropenia, and tumor lysis syndrome.  
2. Grade 3 rash that does not resolve to < Grade 2 within 10 days with corticosteroid treatment  
3. Any grade Stevens -Johnson syndrome or toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]  
4. Grade 3- 4 bullous dermatitis ;  
5. Any grade 2 or greater hemorrhagic event r equiring medical intervention 
or any intracranial hemorrhage;  
6. Any non- hematological toxicity requiring a delay of the next cycle of 
therapy for greater than 10 days;  
7. Grade [ADDRESS_269310] a dose increase of R- CHOP or R- EPOCH on 
subsequent cycles, the dosing of ibrutinib  and lenalidomide could be

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 39 increased to the previous level at the following cycle (e.g., from EPOCH 
level -1 on cycle 3 to  R-CHOP or  EPOCH level 0 on cycle 4, consider 
resume previous ibrutinib and lenalidomide on cycle 5 if cycle 4 R- CHOP 
or EPOCH increas e was tolerable) after discussion of the principle 
investigator and the treating physician.   
9. Based upon Bayesian toxicity monitoring rules established in section 9.2 , 
if >[ADDRESS_269311] level as defined in Table 8.  
10. If criteria 9 occurs  (all future patients have a dose reduction of ibrutinib 
and lenalidomide based upon dose reductions in R- CHOP or  R-EPOCH), 
a new safety criterion would be established. If ≥2 patients in the next 10 
patients required a dose reduction of  R-CHOP or  R-EPOCH below level 0 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_223841], the trial would be 
placed on hold for new patient accrual and would be examined for the 
etiology of the unexpected hematologic toxicity. The trial may be re-opened only after the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223842] 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center IND office and FDA monitors.  
Renal Dysfunction dose adjustment for lenalidomide:  
 
• CrCl > 60mL/minute:   No dosage adjustment necessary  
• CrCl 30 to 60 mL/minute:   10 mg once daily  
• CrCl <30 mL/minute (non- dialysis dependent):   15 mg every 48 hours  
 
Due to the known occurrence of hematol ogic toxicities with R- CHOP or DA -
EPOCH, and the dose modification based upon occurrence  of cytopenias , grade 
4 hematologic toxicities will not be considered significant toxicities  unless they 
meet the above time constraints. In addition, neutropenic fever  incidence will be 
closely monitored, but will also not be considered a significant toxicity  due to the 
known high rate of neutropenic fever with dose adjusted R -EPOCH  and R -CHOP  
(20 – 30%).  
 
If a significant toxicity is definitely attributed  to ibrutinib or lenalidomide per the 
investigator’s assessment, dosing with ibrutinib and or lenalidomide will be 
withheld. Ibrutinib and or lenalidomide treatment may resume as specified in 
Tables [ADDRESS_269312] etely.   If the 
toxicity attributed the ibrutinib or lenalidomide as defined in Section 5.3.1 was 
considered life threatening such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome or toxic

Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version [ADDRESS_269313] grade 1 within 28 days (7 days beyond 
the expected 21 days cycles) of the start of a given therapeutic cycle, ibrutinib 
and lenalidomide will be discontinued for that cycle. Resumption of ibrutinib or lenalidomide would be only considered if the toxicity has resolved to baseline prior to the start of the next cycle, and the patient could be treated at a lower 
dose level (i.e., a patient treated at dose level - 3 prior to this toxicity would not be 
eligible to resume ibrutinib or lenalidomide as they could not further dose 
reduce).  
  
It should be noted that the dose reductions listed in Tables 9 and 10  will only be 
mandatory for future patients if the toxicity monitoring rule thresholds detailed in Section  9.2 are surpassed (i.e. dose reductions are required in ≥ [ADDRESS_269314] 10 
patients at the previous dose level). For an individual patient who experiences a 
toxicity detailed in Section 5.3.1  as significant, a mandatory dose reduction to the 
next lower level in tables 9 and 10 will occur for the following cycle. If the patient 
has no significant toxicities at the lower dose level during the following cycle, the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223843]- escalation to the prior dosing level.  
 
5.3.2  Drug Accountability:  
The study drugs of ibrutinib and lenalidomide must be handled in strict 
accordance with the protocol and the container label, and  must be stored at the 
study site in a limited -access area or in a locked cabinet under appropriate  
environmental conditions. Unused study drugs, and study drug returned by [CONTACT_1560], must be available for verification. The  return of unused study drug 
(ibrutinib  or lenalidomide), or used returned study drug for  destruction, will be 
documented. Ibrutinib and lenalidomide should be dispensed under the 
supervision of the investigator or a qualified member of the study -site personnel, 
or by a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist. Study drugs will be supplied only to subjects participating in the study. Returned study drugs must not be dispensed again, even to the same subject. Study drugs may not be relabeled or reassigned for 
use by [CONTACT_23837].  
 
5.4 Prophylactic medications:  
5.4.1  Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)  
All patients with bulky lymphadenopathy must receive prophylaxis for TLS prior to 
the initiation of study treatment.  This includes appropriate hydration consisting of 
a fluid in take of approximately 2 L/day starting [ADDRESS_269315] dose of 
Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015-0147, Version 7.0 41 rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib and administration of allopurinol (300 
mg/day orally) or a suitable alternative treatment starting prior to Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_269316] 
cycle if the treating physician wishes, however this will not be mandated. All 
patients should then be carefully monitored during the initial weeks of treatment.    
5.4.2 Venous Thrombosis: 
Based upon prior trial data, it will be required for all patients to receive either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 – 325 mg PO daily) or another prophylaxis agent while on lenalidomide. Exceptions will be made if a patient has a previous history of 
significant bleeding or other condition which makes anticoagulation unsafe in the 
determination of the principal investigator, as ibrutinib may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. For further instructions for invasive procedures, see Section 5.7.6.  
 
The choice of VTE prophylaxis agent relies upon the investigator’s discretion and should be tailored to the subject’s individual risk/benefit profile by [CONTACT_177223], bleeding risk, and the quality of 
compliance with the VTE prophylaxis. 
 VTE prophylaxis may need to be held during therapy due the potential of thrombocytopenia associated with either DA-EPOCH, CHOP, lenalidomide, or 
ibrutinib. For guidelines regarding VTE management related to 
thrombocytopenia, refer to Table 11.  Table 11

5.4.3 Administration of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor 
Neutropenia prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is required during all cycles which include R-DA-EPOCH and R-CHOP. However, the selection of a particular drug, for example filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or other is per treating physician discretion..

Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 42  
5.4.4  Infections Prophylaxis  
Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia prophylaxis is required. However, the drug, 
dose and schedule selection are per treating physician discretion.  
Additional antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal prophylaxis is not required. However, treating physicians will be allowed to administer antibiotic, antiviral, and 
antifungal prophylactic medications if they desire. The use of live viral vaccines is 
contraindicated.  
 
5.4.5  CNS Lymphoma Prophylaxis  
Subjects at risk for CNS involvement may receive CNS lymphoma prophylaxis 
treatment. At risk for CNS involvement is defined as high LDH with ≥2 extranodal 
disease sites, testicular, vertebral body, bone marrow, paranasal sinus, renal, or 
adrenal involvement, or at the discretion of the treating physician. The following may be considered by [CONTACT_093]: 4 – 8 doses of intrathecal methotrexate 
and/or cytarabine administered during the systemic treatment. CNS prophylax is 
with IV drugs is not permitted.  For further instructions for invasive procedures, 
see Section 5.7.6.  
 
5.4.6  Hepatitis B Prophylaxis  
To prevent Hepatitis B reactivation, patients who are hepatitis B Core Ab+ but 
hepatitis B sAg - negative may have low levels of hepatitis B viremia and should 
undergo a blood PCR test for hepatitis B viral load. All patients at risk of reactivation will h ave a PCR analysis of blood for viral loads performed 
pretreatment and during treatment. If the PCR test can detect a quantifiable 
hepatitis B viral load, patients should have this value repeated every therapeutic cycle. Additionally, these patients will r eceive appropriate treatment for hepatitis 
B reactivation prophylaxis.  If the PCR analysis is unable to detect a quantifiable 
hepatitis B viral load, no further hepatitis B testing will be required.  
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_269317] one soft bowel 
motion every 24 hours while on study. The treating physician should consider sodium docusate 100mg capsule; take one to two capsules  once a day Days 1- 7 
of each cycle. If needed can double the frequency to two capsules every 12 hours. If needed add oral lactulose 15- 30 ml prn/ every 6 hours.

Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 43 5.5 Radiation Therapy:  
The treating physician  may prospectively, prior to start of initial therapy,  choose 
to give local radiotherapy after study chemotherapy  has completed for the 
treatment of a particular site of bulky disease or a large mass. In the case of 
consolidation treatment, bulky disease is defined as ≥ 7.[ADDRESS_269318] be determined during the Screening Period. In this case, the consolidation radiotherapy will not count as a 
treatment event for the progression endpoints, unless there is evidence of active 
disease at the site and radiation is indicated for treating active disease.  If the investigator should decide at anytime after Cycle 1 Day 1 to give 
consolidation treatment, or to switch treatment to a different lesion, receipt of 
consolidation treatment will count as a progression en dpoint and data will be 
censored.  
 
5.6 Treatment for Subjects who Develop CNS Disease While on Study:  
Patients with known CNS lymphoma are excluded from this study. For those subjects who develop CNS disease after they are enrolled in this study, CNS 
disease will be treated according to standard institutional guidelines and will be 
removed from the study.  
5.7 Dose modifications of chemotherapy  drugs for adverse events:  
5.7.1  Ileus and constipation:  
Symptomatic ileus/constipation may occur as a result of neurotoxicity fro m 
vincristine, however it is usually unnecessary to stop the vincristine altogether. 
Every effort should be made to not unnecessarily reduce doses. 
Ileus/constipation is usually worse during the first cycle, and thus prophylactic bowel care is important. If vincristine dose is reduced for this toxicity, it can often be returned to full dose on subsequent cycles without recurrence of severe 
ileus/constipation. If ileus or constipation requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], reduce 
vincristine 25% on the subsequent cycle. If symptoms resolve after vincristine 
reduction, increase dose to previous level on subsequent cycles.  
Suggested Bowel Regimen – goal of at least one soft bowel motion every 24 
hours while on study  
Adults: Sodium Docusate 100mg capsule; take one to two capsules once a day Days 1 -7 of each cycle. If needed can double the frequency to two capsules 
every 12 hours. If needed add oral lactulose 15- 30 ml prn/ every 6 hours.

If neuropathy resolves to a lower grade, doses for that lower grade may be 
reinstituted at investigator discretion. If the grade of neuropathy increases after being re- escalated, doses must be reduced for the appropriate toxicity grade and 
may not be re- escalated, even if neuropathy resolves again to a lower grade.  
 
5.7.4  Hepatic and R enal Dysfunction  
No dose modifications of chemotherapy  are required for hepatic dysfunction  
thought related to DLBCL manifestations .  
 
Etoposide should be reduced 25% on cycle one for creatinine clearance < 50 cc/min. If the creatinine clearance remains low on subsequent cycles, etoposide 
should remain at the reduced level as in the previous cycle. Etoposide should be 
returned to full dose (or escalated if indicated) once creatinine clearance > 50 cc/min. No other dose modifications for abnormal renal indices will be made for enrolled patients.  
 Monitor patients with liver dysfunction for signs of ibrutinib toxicity and follow 
dose modification guidance as needed. It is not recommended to administer ibrutinib  to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impai rment (Child -Pugh 
classes B and C) .

All dosing is based on the patient’s BSA as calculated from actual weight. There 
is no documented adverse impact of treatment of obese patients when dosing is 
performed according t o actual body weight.  
 
5.7.6  Dose Modi fication for patients who require invasive procedures:  
For any planned surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for 
closure, ibrutinib should be held at least [ADDRESS_269319] 7 days after the procedure, and restarted at the discretion 
of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably healed without 
serosanguineous drainage or the need for drainage tubes.   
 
For planned minor procedures (such as a central l ine placement, lumbar 
puncture, needle biopsy, thoracentesis, or paracentesis) ibrutinib should be held 
for at least [ADDRESS_269320] 7 days after the urgent surgical procedure, or at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
5.7.7  Dose modifications for use with CYP3A inhibitors:  
As stated in the exclusion criteria, patients who require use of a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor will not be eligible for enrollment on this clinical trial. If a patient requires a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (Appendix E : e.g., fluconazole, darunavir, 
erythromycin, diltiazem, atazanavir, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], amprenavir, fosamprevir, crizotinib, imatinib, verapamil, and ciprofloxacin), the dose of ibrutinib should be 
reduced to 140mg daily. If a patient requires use of a strong CYP3A inducer (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin, or St. John’s Wort), ibrutinib should be 
held temporarily while the patient is on the strong CYP3A inducer. Ideally, the 
treating physician could avoid usage of moderate CYP3A inhibitors  or CYP3A 
inducers and keep ibrutinib at full dosing.  
 
5.8 Management of rash:  
 For Grade ≥3 rash, hold ibrutinib  and lenalidomide until rash improves to Grade 
≤1, then resume at original dose if duration of grade 2 or greater rash was <10 
days with corticosteroids  (for the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) , or lower dose as clinically

worsening or not improving, 40 mg prednisone PO or equivalent daily for 10 days 
(with or without taper)  may be utilized.  Allopurinol should be discontinued if rash 
is thought to be at least possibly related to allopurinol. If the rash fails to resolve 
to < grade 2 within 10 days of corticosteroid therapy, then resume at the next lower dosing level in Tables 9 and 10.

8.2 Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Subjects who discontinue any component of therapy without disease progression will continue study drugs (lenalidomide and/or ibrutinib) until therapy is 
completed, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity, whi chever occurs first. 
If study drugs are discontinued for persistent toxicities as defined in Section  
5.3.1, any remaining study treatment (i .e., rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [or equivalent]) may continue.  
Investigators are encouraged to keep subject experiencing clinical benefit (ie, 
PR, CR, or stable disease) in the study unless significant toxicity puts the subject 
at risk or routine noncompliance puts the study outcomes at risk. If a subject's study treatment must be discontinued, this will result in automatic withdrawal of the subject from the study.  
 A subject's study treatment should be discontinued if:  
-The subject experiences overt disease progression or relapse  
-Unacceptable toxicity  
-The subject becomes pregnant  
-The subject refuses further treatment  
-A serious protocol violation has occurred, as determined by [CONTACT_1961]  
-The investigator believes that for safety reasons (eg, adverse event) it is in the 
best interest of the subject to discontinue study treatment  
 If a subject discontinues study treatment before the onset of disease progression,  
End-of-Treatment and post -treatment assessments should be obtained and 
follow up of scheduled assessments should be continued. Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_269342] -treatment efficacy assessments. The reason(s) a 
subject discontinues treatment will be recorded.

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 56 9 Statistical Considerations  
9.1 Study Design  
This will be a single -center, Phase II  clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed 
diffuse large B -cell lymphoma.  The tolerability and efficacy of administrating 
rituximab with lenalidomide and ibrutinib alone (“Smart Start”) and with 
chemotherapy  (RLI-EPOCH  or RLI -CHOP ) will be evaluated.  The attribution of 
the backbone chemotherapy R -CHOP of DA -EPOCH will not be randomized. 
The treating physician  will have discretion to choose either R -CHOP of  R-DA-
EPOCH as backbone chemotherapy. DA -EPOCH dosing will be adjusted based 
upon published criteria in DA -EPOCH containing cycles 2 – 6, and will be capped 
at dose level + 2).  
9.2 Phase 2 clinical trial dosing and sample size  
Based upon data from the PCYC -1124- CA, dosing has been selected for testing 
in up to 60 patients with newly diagnosed ABC  DLBCL . It is anticipated that we 
will accrue approximately a 1:[ADDRESS_269345] the allocation. P atients will start with RLI 
alone prior to the use of chemotherapy  (“Smart Start”) for ≤2 cycles, followed 
by 6 cycles of RLI with  R-CHOP or  dose adjusted (DA) EPOCH. The primary 
objective is to determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as either 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) of RLI alone up to 2 cycles, 
and CR rate observed at the end of 6 cycles of RLI with chemotherapy . 
Secondary objectives include determination of the ORR at the end of the 
treatment, survival outcomes (progression free and overall survival at 1 year), and safety of RLI with R-CHOP or DA -EPOCH.  
In this trial , we are going to both monitor the standard futility and toxicity and 
evaluate the feasibility of introducing the smart start portion within the trial. Two independent monitoring rules will be proposed for each of them. Note that the overall trial will not be stopped due to lack of efficacy in  the smart start portion.     
 
A Bayesian method by  [CONTACT_223906] (1995) will be used for futility and toxicity 
monitoring.  The relevant toxicities for dose adjusting ibrutinib and lenalidomide 
as defined in section 5.3.1 will be referred to as “Tox”.  The trial will be stopped 
early if:  
  
                                    Pr (CR rate < 0. 70 |data) > 0.90  
or 
                                    Pr(Tox  rate > 0.30 | data)  > 0.90  
 
That is, the trial will be stopped early if there is more than a 90% probability that

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 57 the CR rate at the end of all therapy including 6 cycles of RLI -chemotherapy is 
lower than 70 % or if there is more than a 90% probability that the Tox  rate is 
higher than 30%. We assume that CR and Tox  follow a prior distribution of beta 
(0.7, 0.3) and beta (0.3, 0.7), respectively.  
 
The above futility and toxicity monitoring rules will be implemented by a cohort size of 10, starting from the 10th patient enrolled. The corresponding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_223847] [ADDRESS_269346] 10 patients.  If a 
toxicity threshold (Table 13.1) is achieved prior to completing a 10 patient -sized 
cohort, the trial would be stopped prior to completing the 10 patient -sized cohort. 
In addition, an additional safety rule will be implemented that if >[ADDRESS_269347] level of ibrutinib and 
lenalidomide as defined in Table 8.  
 
If >3 patients require a dose reduction below level 0 of chemotherapy , a new 
safety criterion would be established. If ≥2 patients in the next 10 patients 
required a dose reduction of chemo therapy  below level 0 despi[INVESTIGATOR_223848], the trial would be placed on hold for new patient accrual and would be examined for the etiology of the unexpected hematologic 
toxicity. The trial may be re- opened only after the principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223849] M.D. Anderson Cancer Center IND office and FDA monitors.

A total accrual of 60 patients without early termination will provide 95% 
confidence interval of the CR rate with a maximum width  of 0.26.  
A 1:1 repartition of the backbone chemotherapy R -CHOP of DA -EPOCH will be 
targeted, with the goal of having approximately 30 patients treated in  both arms.  
As the chemotherapy regimens of R -CHOP and R -DA-EPOCH are considered 
equally effective, we will analyze the groups of R -CHOP and R -EPOCH together 
for the Primary Objective of CR after RLI -chemotherapy, and separately for 
secondary end points, however the trial will not be powered to directly compare 
the groups.  
9.3 Analysis Plan  
Data analysis will be performed using SAS or R, as appropriate. The OR rate of 
smart start, CR rate of RLI+ chemotherapy , DLT rate, and OS/PFS rate at the 
landmark time point of 1 year will be summarized by [CONTACT_151660] 95% 
confidence interval. Patients who received at least one dose of the treatment drug will be evaluable for toxicity outcomes.  Toxicities will be summari zed by

9.4.1  To determine whether rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib enhances the frequency and function of tumor -specific T -cells in the peripheral blood, 
the phenotype and function of T cells will be assessed as follows:  
Phenotypic studies for T cells. PBMC (1 x 10
5 per tube) will be analyzed by

Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 60 multiparametric flow cytometry on 6- color, 8 parameter FACS Canto (BD 
Pharmingen) after staining with a panel of antibodies in 2 separate tubes. Tube 
1: PBMC will be stained with CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD69, and PD- 1 to 
determine the percentage of total T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, effector/memory (CD45RO+) T cells within each subset, activation status (CD69+) of T cells within each subset, and PD -1 expression within each subset. 
Tube 2: PBMC will be stained with CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD62L, CD27, 
CD127 and CCR7 to determine the percentage of effector memory T cells 
(CD45RO+CD27 -CCR7 -, CD62L -CD127+) and central memory T cells 
(CD45RO+CD27+CCR7+, CD62L+CD127+) within CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell 
subsets. The absolute number of each of these T -cell subsets in  the peripheral 
blood of the patients will be calculated using the following formula: (absolute 
number of lymphocytes per µ l of blood on the CBC analysis) x (% of T -cell subset 
in lymphocyte gate).  
 
9.4.2  To determine whether rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibruti nib enhances the 
CD4

be performed on the core biopsy samples:  
Immunofluorescence studies.  To determine whether administration of rituximab, 
lenalidomide, and ibrutinib enhances the CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell numbers at the 
tumor site, we will perform flow cytometry as described in 9.5.1 on FNA samples 
from baseline and day 14 after rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib.

biomarker between the response group and the non- response group. The 
percentage change will also be dichotomized into two categories (high vs.

but responsive to RLI with chemotherapy ; and Group C: Non- responsive 
to RLI or RLI with chemotherapy . The baseline biopsy from all groups will 
be evaluated with RNA sequencing (RNA -Seq) (72), in comparison with 
germline DNA, to determine gene expression, translocations, and 
mutations including those known to correlate with ibrutinib resistance (e.g., BTK, PLCγ2, MYD88 , CARD11, CD79A/B ).(5, 66-68, 73) To attempt 
correlation of GEP data with clinical responses to RLI and RLI -
chemotherapy  separately by [CONTACT_223910] A -C, a  regression analysis will be 
performed. We will also perform RNA -Seq on the paired FNA biopsies 
from day [ADDRESS_269352] quality 
assessments and R software packages. (72, 74, 75) Gene expression will 
be compared against the continuous variable of tumor regression 
percentage and/or changes in LymphoSIGHT values, and analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (76) to evaluate for processes in 
the tumor cells and microenvironment which are associated with response 
to R-CHOP, but have an unknown relevance to RLI. (5) RNA -Seq will als o 
allow detection and quantification of mutated genes in each sample, either 
present in baseline samples or arising de novo in day 14 samples: these will be analyzed for correlation with response, to identify those which may 
help to understand or predict resistance to RLI. Comparison of intra-
patient paired samples will help to overcome inter -patient differences in 
GEP and mutation analyses, as shown in the analysis of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_223856].(77) We will also perform RNA -Seq on biopsies of residual disease, 
and potentially perform focused deep sequencing of DNA from residual tumor, PBMC (germline), and initial biopsy.  The RNA -Seq will be carried 
out at Center for Lymphoid Cancer -BC Cancer Agency at Vacouver, BC,

10.2 Adverse event classifications  
Adverse Event (AE ) – Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the 
subject’s participation in the research in which a subject is administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non- investigational) product.  An adverse event does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  
 T
his includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or 
frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
 
Expected AE  -
  Any AE with specificity or severity that is consistent with the 

Smart Start: A Phase II Study of Rituximab, Lenalidomide, Ibrutinib and 
Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 65 current Investigator Brochure (IB) or consistent with the risk information 
described in the Informed Consent Document (ICD) or general investigational plan.  
 
Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR)  
A valid ICSR must contain the four minimum criteria required to meet 
regulatory reporting requirements.  
• an identifiable subject (but not disclosing personal information such as 
the subject’s name, initials or address)  
• an identifiable reporter (investigational site)  
• a Janssen medicinal product  
• an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situations  
 
The minimum information required is:  
• suspected Janssen medicinal product (doses, indication)  
• date of therapy (start and end date, if available)  
• batch or lot number, if available  
• subject details (subject ID and country)  
• gender  
• age at AE onset  
• reporter ID  
• adverse event detail (AE verbatim in English), onset date, relatedness, causality, action taken, outcome, (if available)  
• Janssen protocol ID  
 Product Quality Complaint (PQC)  
A product quality compliant is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the product, or delivery system.  Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and batch numbers are of high significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQC include but not limited to:  
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled 
release product  
• Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g.,  autoinjector button not working, needle detaching from syringe  
• Suspected Contamination

Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 66 • Suspected Counterfeit  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  – Any AE associated with the subject’s 
participation in research that:   
• r esults in death;  
• is life -threatening, (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred) . An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of Principal Investigator, its 
occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death ; 
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
o Important medical events as defined above may also 
be considered serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE 
if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_223857], the IND Office.  
NOTE: DEATH FO R ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48804], it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which 
led to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_223858].

• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g., social reasons such as pending placement in long- term 
care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83380]. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originally planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23745] a new serious adverse event.]  
  Life-Threatening Conditi ons 
 Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse event term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression/lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event definition.  
 
Unexpected (Unanticipated) AE  
 - Any AE, with specificity or severity that is not 
consistent with the current IB, or the applicable product reference safety information, or not consistent with the risk information described in the informed 
consent document or general investigational plan.

However, a potential alternate etiology may be responsible for the event. The 
effect of drug withdrawal is unclear. Rechallenge information is unclear or lacking.  
Unlikely  – The
  adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent.  
Unrelated – Events that would occur regardless of study participation, including 
events that are clearly random occurrences. If the frequency of the event suggests a possible connection to the study intervention, then it should be considered related. If the event is clearly related to other factors, such as a 
patient's clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications, the 
event would be considered unrelated to therapy.

Events that Janssen Scientific Affairs is  actively monitoring as a result of a 
previously identified signal (even if non- serious), and are listed below:  
• Major Hemorrhage  
Major hemorrhage is defined as any hemorrhagic event that is Grade 3 or greater in severity or that results in 1 of the following: intraocular bleeding causing loss of 
vision, the need for a transfusion of 2 or more units of red cells or an equivalent 
amount of whole blood, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Intracranial Hemorrhage 
Any intracranial hemorrhage adverse event, including subdural 
hematoma/hemorrhage, epi[INVESTIGATOR_110116]/hemorrhage and intracerebral 
hemorrhage, of any grade severity, will be captured as an event of special 
interest.  
• Other Malignancies  
In addition to all routine AE reporting, all new malignant tumors, including solid 
tumors, skin malignancies and hematologic malignancies, are to be reported for 
the duration of study treatment and during any protocol -specified follow -up 
periods including post -progression follow -up for  overall survival.

Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 77 12 Appendix A:  Chemotherapy Information  
12.1 Rituximab  
Rituximab (Rituxan®) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD20 
a receptor in the surface of malignant B -cell lymphocytes. The drug has 
activity against aggressive and non- aggressive NHL of B -cell origin, and 
has been used in combination with chemotherapy.  
12.1.1  Supply  
Rituximab is commercially available.  
Rituximab is provided in pharmaceutical grade glass vials containing 10 mL (100 mg) or 50 mL (500 mg) at a concentration of [ADDRESS_269371] of adverse events.  
12.1.2  Storage  
Rituximab for clinical use should be stored in a secure refrigerator at 2º to 8°C. 
12.1.3  Preparation  
Rituximab will be diluted to a final volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose Injection to prepare a standard product with concentration of 2 
mg/ml. Caution should be taken during the  
preparation of the drug, as shaking can cause aggregation and pr ecipi 
 
 
 [INVESTIGATOR_151176]  
12.1.4  Stability  
After dilution, rituximab is stable at 2- 8 degrees C (36- 46 degrees F) for 
24 hours and at room temperature for an additional 24 hours.  
12.1.5  Administration  
A peripheral or central intravenous line will be established. D uring 
rituximab infusion, a patient's vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], temperature) should be monitored according to the standard 
of care. Medications readily available for the emergency management of 
anaphylactoid reactions should include:  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000, 1 mg/mL) 
for subcutaneous injection diphenhydramine hydrochloride for intravenous injection, and resuscitation equipment.

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version [ADDRESS_269372] dose of prednisone 60 mg/m2 (or a glucocorticoid equivalent dose of an alternative steroid) at least 60 minutes before rituximab treatment commences. 
Rituximab will be administered as an intravenous infusion at 375 mg/m2 
on day 1 of each cycle of DA-EPOCH, immediately prior to starting 
etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine administration.  
 
The initial dose rate at the time of the first rituximab infusion should be 
50mg/hour (25 mL/hr) for the first 30 minutes. If no toxicity is seen, the dose rate may be escalated gradually in 50 mg/hour (25 mL/h) increments at 30 minute intervals) to a max imum of 400 mg/hour 
(maximum rate = 200 mL/h).  
 Second and Subsequent Doses (select the appropriate administration timing based upon the following parameters):  
 90-minute Administration  
If the first dose of rituximab was well tolerated, subsequent doses may be administered over 90 minutes with ~20% of the total dose given in the first 30 minutes, and remaining ~80% of the total dose administered over 
the subsequent 60 minutes. The 90- minute infusion scheme is not 
recommended for patients with clinically significant cardiovascular 
disease, previous significant rituximab infusional reactions, or high circulating lymphocyte counts (≥5000/mcL).  
 Standard Administration for Second & Subsequent Infusions  
Patients who tolerate initial treatment without experiencing infusion-
related adverse effects but for whom the 90- minute infusion scheme 
during subsequent treatments is considered inappropriate, may receive subsequent rituximab doses at the Standard Rate for Subsequent Infusions, which is as follows:

Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 79 12.1.6  Safety Profile  
No dose- limiting effects were observed in the Phase I/II studies. Reported 
adverse events including fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, 
rhinitis, asthenia, and hypotension, occurred  
primarily during rituximab infusions and typi[INVESTIGATOR_223864] a slower rate.  
Fatal Infusion Reactions: Severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, 
including angioedema, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421], myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock, have been reported. These severe reactions  typi[INVESTIGATOR_27803] 30- 120 minutes.  
 Cardiac Events: Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmia and angina, have had recurrences of these cardiac events during rituximab infusions.  
 Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome, some with fatal outcome, has been reported and is characterized in patients with a high number of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000 ul) by [CONTACT_223916], renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia.  
 Renal Events: Rituximab has been associated with severe renal toxicity including acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and in some cases has led  
to death. Renal toxicity has occurred inpatients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000/mm2 ) or high tumor burden who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients administered concomitant cisplatin.  
 Mucocutaneous Reactions: Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal 
cases of toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_223865], have been reported in patients treated with rituximab. The onset of reaction 
has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following rituximab expos ure. 
 
Hematologic Events: In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated with rituximab; these include: 
lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), 
and thrombocytopenia (2%). The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 
days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days). A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version 7 .0 80 aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic  
anemia following Rituximab therapy were reported.  
In addition, there have been a limited number of post -marketing reports of 
prolonged pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia.  
 
Infectious Events: rituximab induced B -cell depletion in 70% to 80% of 
patients with NHL and was associ ated with decreased serum 
immunoglobulins in a minority of patients; the lymphopenia lasted a median of 14 days (range, 1- 588 days). Infectious events occurred in 
31% of patients: 19% of patients had bacterial infections, 10% had viral infections, 1% had f ungal infections, and 6% were unknown infections. 
Serious infectious events (Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, occurred in 2% of patients.  
 Hepatitis B Reactivation: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with 
fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some 
patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab. The majority of patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately four 
months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately one month after 
the last dose.  
 Other Serious Viral Infections: The following additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated or exacerbated, have been identified in 
clinical studies or post -marketing reports. The majority of patients 
received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These viral infections included JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]), 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster 
virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C. In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to one year following discontinuation of rituximab and have resulted in death.  
 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) 
PML is a rare disease caused by [CONTACT_223917]. Immunosuppression allows reactivation of the JC virus which 
causes demyelination and destruction of oligodendrocytes resulting in 
death or severe disability. Rare cases of PML, some resulting in death, have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies who have received rituximab. The majority of these patients had received rituximab

Chemotherapy  in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B -Cell 
Lymphoma 
Protocol 2015- 0147, Version [ADDRESS_269373], brain MRI, and lumbar puncture should be considered as clinically indicated. In 
patients who develop PML, rituximab should be discontinued and 
reductions or discontinuation of any concomitant chemotherapy or 
immunosuppressive therapy should be considered.  
 Bowel Obstruction and Perforation: Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction 
and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in 
patients receiving Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL. In post -marketing reports, which include both patients with low  grade or 
follicular NHL and DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 
days (range 1−77) in patients with documented gastro- intestinal 
perforation. Complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in the course 
of treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.  
 
Immunogenicity: Patients may develop a human anti -chimeric antibody 
(HACA) response with rituximab treatment. The clinical significance of 
this is unclear.  
 
Pregnancy: B -cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting less than 6 months 
can occur in infants exposed to rituximab in utero.  
 
Immunization: Response rates may be reduced with non- live vaccines.  
Additional Safety Signals: The following serious adverse events have been reported to occur in patients following completion of rituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders of blood vessels (vasculitis, serum sickness and lupus -like syndrome), eye disorders (uveitis and optic neuritis), lung 
disorders including pleuritis and scarring of the lung (bronchiolitis obliterans) , that may result in fatal outcomes, and fatal cardiac failure.

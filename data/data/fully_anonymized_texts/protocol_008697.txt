Revision Date: 4/10/2020  1.0 Background  
Dementia is an increasingly prevalent, costly and burdensome condition.  The dramatic aging of the US 
population is creating a dementia “epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]” that our health care system is poorly prepared to handle.   More 
than 5 million people are affected by [CONTACT_7351]’s disease (AD) and related dementias in 2016, with that 
number estimated to nearly triple to 13.[ADDRESS_369773] health care costs alone for dementia care 
are projected to increase from $236 billion in 2016 to more than $[ADDRESS_369774] been identified as priority conditions for research and quality improvement by [CONTACT_302732], National Quality Forum, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and NIA.  In addition,  a 
workgroup developi[INVESTIGATOR_302718] U.S. National Alzheimer’s Plan has 
explicitly stated that palliative care needs to be incorporated throughout the course of caring for patients and families affected by [CONTACT_101698].  
 
 2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
Aim 1:  To test the effect of the IN -PEACE intervention on patients’ neuropsychiatric 
symptoms (e.g., agitation/aggression, anxiety, repetitive behaviors).   Mixed effects models will 
be used to compare repeated NPI -Q scores obtained at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months . 
Repeatedly measured NPI -Q scores will be the dependent variable in the model.  
  
Aim 2: To test the effect of the IN -PEACE intervention on patients’ overall symptom outcomes.   
Analyses in this aim will use repeatedly measured SM -EOLD scores over 24 months of follow -up as 
the dependent variable in the mixed effects model, similarly to the approach described for Aim 1.  
  Aim 3: To test the effect of the IN -PEACE intervention on caregivers’ distress and mood.  Aim 3 
analyses will use repeatedly measured caregiver NPI -Q distress scores and caregiver PHQ -9 over 24 
months of follow -up as the dependent variables in separate mixed effects models, similar to the 
approach for Aim 1.  
  Aim 4: Evaluate the effect of the IN -PEACE intervention on ER/ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399] .  ER/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_302719] (IHIE) and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC).   Poisson regression 
models will be used to compare rates of any ER/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_302720].  
 
3.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 We will recruit a total of 2 25 patient -caregiver dyads, randomizing 112  dyads each to the intervention and 
control (usual care) arms.  
 
Eligibility criteria for patients include:  
• age 65 or older 
• community -dwelling in the Indianapolis metropolitan area (assisted living facility acceptable; 
long stay NH residents excluded);  
• have an established diagnosis of dementia of any etiology as determined by [CONTACT_302733];  
Revision Date: 4/10/2020  • dementia in the moderate (FAST stage 5) to severe stage (FAST 6- 7); and  
• have a primary caregiver available and willing to serve as both an informant on the patient’s 
status and as a subject him or herself.  
 Exclusion criteria for patients include:  
• resident living in a nursing facility, Skilled Nursing Facility, Long Term Acute Care (LTC), 
Personal Care Home  
• patient expressing dissent  
• being diagnosed with a serious mental illness such as bipolar or schizophrenia 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24194] (Addition IRB Approved: 5/13/2019) 
 
Eligibility criteria for caregivers include:  
 
• reside locally;  
• English- speaking;  
• live with patient or have at least 2 contacts per week on average with the patient (1 face -to-
face);  
• designation as the patient’s primary caregiver ; and 
• has not been diagnosed with a serious mental illness such as bipolar or schizophrenia.   
 
Recruitment  
Dyads will be recruited from Indiana Discovery Network for Dementia (http://indydiscoverynetwork.org/ ) 
memory care practices in the Indianapolis area. Utilizing established memory care practices allows us to rely on their diagnostic assessment (confirmed by [CONTACT_302734]) and to efficiently recruit eligible 
subjects.  Our customary and successful recruitment methods utilize the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) and the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) to identify potentially eligible patients with 
dementia based on ICD -[ADDRESS_369775] of potential dyads to be approached and allow access 
to clinic schedules.  Research assistants then arrange to meet dyads at a clinic appointment or offer a home 
visit to di scuss the study.  
 
Research staff will ask caregivers a series of questions to assess the patient’s cognitive and functional status. 
This information will be used to determine the severity of the patient’s dementia using the FAST.    Only 
patients meeting criteria for FAST stage 5 (moderately severe) or stage 6 -7 (severe) will continue in the 
enrollment process.  
 
An IN -PEACE research assistant, with approval from the practitioner, will obtain informed consent of the 
patient’s legally authorized representative (LAR) for study participation. (The LAR and caregiver will be two individuals in a few cases. For example, one adult child may hold power of attorney for the patient and another adult child may be the primary caregiver. In those cases, the LAR gives proxy consent for the patient 
and the caregiver gives informed consent for their own participation.)  Because the  severity of the patient’s 
dementia is advanced, while decision making capacity of the patient will be assessed using the teach -back 
method, we expect most patients will lack decisions making capacity to provide informed consent  If the patient 
expresses meaningful dissent, patient will not be enrolled, even if the LAR is willing to consent.  
 
Potential subjects can self -refer for this study. Approved study brochures will be distributed at community 
events, such as conferences, meetings, or other contacts with the public. Interested subjects will be asked to provide their name, email address, telephone number and mailing address.  A Research Assistant will contact [CONTACT_302735]/ exclusion criteria to determine 
eligibility.
   We may email/ direct mail consent statement to intereste d participants, upon request.  The 
mail/email template will include the scripted language previously approved with the screening/ enrollment script, and approved IN -PEACE brochure .  An Email/Direct mail template has been approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
 
Revision Date: 4/10/2020  4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
After enrollment and baseline assessments are completed, subjects will be classified according to disease severity (moderately severe (FAST = 5) or severe (FAST = 6 -7).  
 Stratified randomization based upon dementia severity will be used to assign patient -caregiver dyads to either 
the intervention or usual care arm.

Intervention  
Intervention arm . Multi -disciplinary clinical team meetings with PI, co -investigators (MA, KK, SH , 
AMT ), and care coordinators will be held weekly  throughout the study.  During these meetings, the 
team will review data f rom the baseline assessments to  
• identify triggers for interventions,  
• make protocol and other treatment recommendations, and  
• communicate these to the care coordinator for dyads randomized to the intervention arm . 
Caregivers will be contact[CONTACT_302737].   
 Care coordinators will initiate caregiver protocols to address unmet needs and individualized areas of focused care , overcoming barriers to provision of excellent palliative care.   The assigned care 
coordinator will be the primary contact [CONTACT_302738] -coverage (i.e. social worker may call in RN for help with nursing issues and vice 
versa).  
 The coordinator will direct the caregiver to the INPEACE manual ( provided at enrollment that contains 
PREVENT materials relating basic dementia care needs, caring for the caregiver, management of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the IN -PEACE materials on goal setting and advance care planning, 
pain evaluation and management, navigating the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], feeding difficulties, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_302722], including appropriate industry materials).  Specific tools to aid in the evaluation and management of 
pain include a list of nonverbal indicators of pain

coordinators throughout the study at times of acute events or symptom changes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or with questions, concerns, and referral/resource requests.   
 Care coordinators will record information on all contacts and interventions in templated notes in the web-based tracking system, both to provide information for follow up, as well as to provide descriptive 
information on numbers and types of contacts, prot ocols triggered, and interventions carried out.   
 Care coordinators will initiate contact [CONTACT_302739] 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_369780],  the DCC will use , open- ended questions about the patient’s 
most bothersome symptoms, and the caregiver’s assessment of the patient’s level of pain.   Responses indicating symptoms that are frequent or causing distress in the patient or caregiver 
trigger the appropriate protocols for managing those symptoms. Non -pharmacological and behavioral 
strategies have an early and  important role in the protocols.  Several of the protocols have the 
equivalent of laboratory “panic values,” findings that would trigger a more intensive response from the care coordinator.   For example, new onset pain that is severe would result in a cal l to the patient’s 
primary care physician and discussion about whether the patient should be seen in the office or even the emergency room.  Some of the protocols may trigger follow up sooner than the next scheduled Respondent Burden  Benefit and Burden Scale108 4  X X X X X X X X X

Some protocols, such as feeding/weight loss and planning for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], may be triggered either by a decline in  functional status or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], rather than a symptom.   Goal setting and advance 
care planning will be addressed repeatedly, first at enrollment and then as major changes in clinical status occur.  The clinical team will meet weekly with the care coordinators to discuss scheduled 
contact [CONTACT_120942], caregiver initiated contacts and questions, and review and revise plans of care. Recommendati ons of the clinical team will be tracked in the care coordinator’s contact [CONTACT_302740].   For more  urgent  medical issues, care coordinators can contact [CONTACT_302741].

patient and caregiver and are not part of the separately scheduled research outcome assessments.  
The team also wil l review any interventions carried out or ordered by [CONTACT_278425], additional 
services recommended, and assess initial responses to these actions, if already available. The team may further modify the care plan.   
 
The two Research Assistants will be blinded to the randomization assignment and will not be involved in any meetings or discussions about intervention subjects. The research manager  (LH) will review 
outcomes measures  and if there are any values that exceed pre- specified levels, she will bring those 
to the attention of the PI. These are similar in nature to “urgent” or “panic” values in laboratory blood 
test reports or X -ray reports requiring attention of a clinician and represent a safety feature for all 
dyads, control and intervention, and not a part of the IN -PEACE intervention .  For example, any 
severe pain or pain associated with a fall or other trauma will result in a call to a physician and either scheduling of an appointment or instructions to go to the emergency room.   
 
The revised plans of care generated by [CONTACT_302742]: 4/10/2020  intervention.  T ailoring protocolized treatment actions to the particular patient’s needs is the standard 
for multi -component trials of collaborative care interventions . 
 
The care coordinators will send periodic updates, in the mode and frequency as requested, to the patient’s primary care provider. Most participating providers in the Indianapolis area will be familiar with electing secure email, fax, phone, or text pager f or their preferred modes of communication 
because of the INPC, IHIE, and other ongoing, innovative efforts, such as those sending pending lab results from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_302728]’ offices . The team will communicate 
with the primary  care provider to request referrals to other specialists and when initiating protocols 
such as pain and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_302729].  
 Additionally, up to [ADDRESS_369783] and experience with decisions to 
deprescribe medications of caregivers for communi ty dwelling patients with moderate- severe AD with 
a focus on learning from the caregivers the ethical considerations that they take into account. The study will employ semi -structured interviews (in- person or by [CONTACT_756]) and qualitative methods for 
analy zing transcriptions of the recorded interviews.   
 
 Usual care arm.   
Dyads randomized to “usual care,” will be receiving care that is likely of a higher quality than 
the typi[INVESTIGATOR_302730].  However, control dyads will not have access  to the dementia care coordinator 
proactively making contact, assessing needs, and implementing IN -PEACE management protocols 
as the intervention subjects will have.  Caregivers in the usual care group will have access to 
educational and informational mat erials from the local chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association and 
other community resources and will be reminded of their availability.  Protocols will be in place for appropriate referral when research assistants’ assessments elicit information about sever e symptoms 
or distress . 
 Data Collection  
Baseline and final outcome assessments will be done in person at the subjects’ home or the memory care practice site. Other outcome assessments will be done by [CONTACT_302743], based on caregiver preference.  The outcome measures for both intervention and usual care groups will be 
collected at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and [ADDRESS_369784] -enrollment. Caregivers also will 
be interviewed 6 to 8 weeks after the patient’s death if that occurs during the course of the study. Data will be collecte d by [CONTACT_302744].  
 Data obtained from the one- time qualitative interview will be audio- record and transcriptions will be 
used for data analysis using grounded theory.  
 6.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others  
 The safety monitoring for this study will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (Sachs), 
study biostatistician (Gao), and Safety Officer, who is external to Indiana University , and  who are 
knowledgeable about dementia and older adults.  Specifically, the Safety Officer will be selected 
based on the knowledge and experience in dementia, caregiving, palliative care, and clinical research 
studies.  The Safety Officer, PI, Program Officer, and study biostatistician will meet by [CONTACT_302745] -

inclusion/exclusion criteria; participant accrual; and adherence and modifications to research protocols and procedures. Preliminary data trends on the  primary and secondary outcomes will be 
discussed.  In addition, the group will review procedures for protection of human subjects, including study withdrawals and adverse events reports and devise stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], as applicable, based on potential harms an d adverse events.    
 7.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation

  9.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
We will also take great care in assuring data security.  Perhaps the most important element of 
data security is proper training of the scientists and their staff in research involving human subjects and in privacy and confidentiality.  Data are handled only by [CONTACT_302746].  Data are stored on a secured workstation that is in a locked office within a locked suite of offices and the workstation and files are password protected.  On rare 
occasions when data are to be transferred from secured workstations to one of the investigators’ workstations for further analyses, the transferred dataset will be stripped of unique identifiers (de-identified dataset) including SSN, name, address, dates, and any personal identifiers.  This is standard operating procedures for our work with research data.  In addition, Regenstrief Institute databases and individual workstations are protected from unauthorized remote access by a sophisticated firewall which is tested on a regular basis.  Data presented in reports are always reported in aggregate and never contain personally identifiable health information.

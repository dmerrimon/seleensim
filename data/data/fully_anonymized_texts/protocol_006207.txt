 RATIONALE  The proposed study aims to investigate the feasibility, accep tability, and 
effectiveness of pharmacy dispensing of Mifeprex®; s afety data will also be 
collected. The results of this study eventually could lead to changes in the 
Mifeprex® R EMS t hat would improve acc ess to legal, safe abortion services 
in the US. 
Trained ph armacists already successfully deliver care related for stigmatized 
health conditions, including sexually transmitted infections, family planning, 
and e mergency  contraception. In additi on, ph armacy dispensing of 
mifepristone is already a reality in other coun tries, such as Australia, wh ere 
it has improved access t o medication abortion, pa rticularly in rural areas 
(Grossman, 2015 ); pharmacy dispensing is also being implemented in 
Canada (OCP, 2017 ). 
Pharmacy dispensing of M ifeprex® by [CONTACT_23872] p harmacists could improve 
access to medication abortion f or women. Pha rmacy dispensing could allow 
women to by[CONTACT_172174], financial, or insurance obstacles to clinic- 
based care and  receive abortion care earlier in pregnancy  (Drey et al., 200 6; 
D. A. Grossman, Gr indlay, Buchac ker, Potter, & Schmertmann, 2013 ; 
Jerman, F rohwirth, Kavanaugh, & Blades, 2 017) and h elp to facilitate 
provision of  medication abortion through telemedicine, reducing the 
disparity in access be tween rural and urban settings (D. Grossman, Gr indlay, 
Buchac ker, Lane, &  Blanchard, 20 11; D. A. Grossman et al., 201 3). In light 
of a declining number of abortion providers in the US  (Jones & Kooistra, 
2011, Jones & Jerman, 201 4), pha rmacy dispensing could also help increase 
the num ber of clinicians willing and a ble to provide m edication abortion by 
[CONTACT_873681] d ispensing the medication at their facilities. 
Pharmacy dispensing of mifepristone would not affect the standard of care 
or recommended c linical protocol for medication. M ifeprex® would still be 
prescribed to patients by [CONTACT_873682]® following the current standard assessment of eligibility for 
medication abo rtion. The o nly difference i n this study is that the patient 
would obtain the m ifepristone directly from the pha rmacist, rather than in a 
clinic facility.  In most settings women go to a pha rmacy for pain 
medications and anti-emetics, and sometimes for misoprostol. 
Home administration of M ifeprex® is now allowed under the up dated 
Mifeprex® labeling (FDA, 2016a ). Study  participants will be told by [CONTACT_873683] d take the Mifeprex®, a nd participants 
will be contact[CONTACT_873684] m edication 
as pr escribed.

Rationale for Number 
of Subjects We aim to recruit up to 350 patients for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], which is a feasible 
sample at the study sites. With a sample size of 350, if the pr oportion of 
patients with a complete abortion is 95%, the 95% confidence interval of that 
proportion will be +2. 7%. Abortion com pletion is an important clinical 
outcome. 
 
We a im to sur vey all the pharmacists at the study sites, up to 50. This 
sample size will be d etermined by  [CONTACT_873687].

 1 BACKGROU ND 
 
Medical termination of intrauterine pregnanc y, also known as medication abo rtion, is a safe 
and effective alternative to surgical abortion (vacuum  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]). Mifeprex® (generic: 
mifepristone), which is a progestin antagonist that competitively interacts with progesterone 
at progesterone- receptor sites, used together with m isoprostol is the gold standard regimen 
for medication abo rtion. In studies performed in the [LOCATION_002] up to 70 d ays gestation 
using this dosing regimen, 97.4% of  patients reportedly had a  complete abortion (FDA, 
2016a ). Another 2.6% received surgical intervention, o r vacuum  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], for reasons such 
as ongoing pregnanc y, patient reque st, bleeding, medical necessity and i ncomplete 
expu lsion. 
 
 
Medication abortion up to [ADDRESS_1220225] been  reported with this treatment, this complication is very rare; 
only [ADDRESS_1220226] 3 million u ses of the m edication 
(FDA, 2011 ). Uterine bleeding requiring m edical or surgical intervention is also a known 
complication of the treatment. Heavy bleeding requiring surgical treatment occurs in approximately 
1% of patients, and blood transfusion is required in <0.1%. Adverse events that are more common 
include nausea, vomiting, weakness, fever/chills, headache, diarrhea and  dizziness (FDA, 2016a ). 
 
 
In Ma rch 2016, the Food an d Drug Administration (FDA) approved an upd ated label for 
Mifeprex® to reflect recent research pub lished since the drug’s original approval in 2000 (FDA, 
2016a ). The approved do sing regimen includes oral mifepristone (200 m g) followed by  a dos e of 
misoprostol (800 m cg) administered buc cally 24-48 hour s later. The c hanges made to the label 
included a more effective dosing regimen cont aining less mifepristone (200 mg instead of 600 mg) 
and m ore misoprostol (800 mcg instead of 400 m cg) via the buccal route, extension of the 
gestational age limit for treatment from [ADDRESS_1220227] be a physician, and e limination of 
the requirement to report nonfatal adverse events to Danco L aboratories, LLC , the drug’s US  
distributor, and the FDA. 
 
 
In addition, the upda ted label no longer requires that Mifeprex® or misoprostol be taken in the 
facility where they are dispensed. A systematic review of nine studies with over 4,500 pa rticipants 
compared ou tcomes of  those who took  misoprostol at home to those who t ook it in a clinical setting 
(Ngo, Pa rk, Sha kur, & Fr ee, 2011) . Complete abortion and com plication rates were not  different 
between the groups, but women who used m isoprostol at hom e were more likely to be s atisfied and 
recommend t he m ethod t o a friend. I n one US  study of 400 w omen at  six sites, 32% chose to take 
mifepristone at hom e, and complete abortion rates were similar between those who  took the drug in 
the clinic and at home (96%-97%) (Chong  et al., 201 5). Among those who took mifepristone at 
home, 82%  reported taking the medication at the time they planne d with their provider, and no 
participant took it after 63 days gestation which w as the gestational a ge lim it at the time of the study. 
 
 
In addition to buccal administration, misoprostol 800 mcg is commonly administered vaginally in an 
off-label regimen for medication ab ortion, w hich is also recommended by  [CONTACT_873688] G ynecologists (ACOG, 2014 ). This regimen allows for a shorter interval be tween 
the two medications, whi ch some patients prefer. Up to 63 days gestation, vaginal misoprostol given 
at the same tim e as m ifepristone results in complete abortion in approximately 
Protocol MifePharmacy201 9 Confiden tial 
Version #:1.7 Version Date: 1/9/20  Page 11 of 31 
Protocol Template © CFFT TDN   Effective: 12 SEP 2007  
 95% of cases (Creinin et al., 2007) . Another common regimen involves ad ministering misoprostol 
800 m cg vaginally 6-8 hour s after mifepristone, w hich has a complete abortion rate of 95.8% up to 
63 da ys gestation and fewer side effects compared to a 24-hour dosing interval (Creinin et al., 
2004) . 
 
 
Numerous st udies performed in the US  and other coun tries have demonstrated that medication 
abortion has a high level of accep tability for a majority of women seeking pregnancy termination 
(Beckman &  Harvey, 1997;  Christin-Maitre, Bouc hard, & Spi[INVESTIGATOR_7316], 2000 ). In a m eta-analysis of 
approximately 4,500 patients who un derwent pregnancy termination with mifepristone and 
misoprostol, over 85% of women were s atisfied w ith the exp erience (Ngo et al., 2011). Medication 
abortion accoun ts for a growing share of US abortions, from  17% of non-hospi [INVESTIGATOR_873663] 
2008 t o 31% in 2014 (Jones, 2017 ). Medication abortions a ccoun ted for 45% of all abortions up  to 
nine w eeks gestation in 201 4, up f rom 26% in 2008 (Jones, 201 7). 
 
 
Some evidence s ugge sts that improved access to mifepristone is associated w ith a reduction in the 
proportion of abortions performed in the second trimester, which is important from a pub lic health 
perspective because later abortion is associated with a significantly increased risk of complications 
and de ath compared to early abort ion (Zane et al., 201 5). In one st udy in Iowa, dev elopment of a 
program providing medication abortion using telemedicine w as associated w ith a significant increase 
in the proportions of abortion that were performed wi th medication. After controlling for other 
factors, wo men seeking abortion in the two years after telemedicine w as introduc ed had a 
significantly higher odds  of obtaining a first-trimester abortion compared to the two years prior (D. 
A. Grossman et  al., 2013). Conversely, in [LOCATION_007], second-trimester abortion increased by 27% in the 
year after restrictions o n access to abortion were imposed, including limitations on the use of 
medication abo rtion that led to a 70% decline in use  of this method (D. Grossman, 2017) . 
 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_172129], there is evidenc e that some wo men face b arriers 
accessing this method, and this can be particularly distressing when t hey have a strong preference for 
the m ethod (Baum, Wh ite, Hop kins, P otter, & Grossman, 2016 ). In particular, the closure of abo rtion 
facilities across the cou ntry (Deprez, 2016 ), which has increased the distance wo men m ust tr avel to 
access abortion care, may make it harder to access m edication abortion. The l onger travel distances, 
which increase the cost and logistical difficulty of getting to a c linic, may create delays that push 
women past the gestational age limit for medication abortion (Baum et al., 2016 ; Fuentes et al., 
2016). 
 
 
Medication abortion in the US is primarily offered by  [CONTACT_172185]. Uptake of 
medication abortion provision among private phy sicians has been less than e xpected—especially in 
areas not served by  [CONTACT_172186]. In 2005, t here were only four providers of 
Mifeprex® medication abortion that were located m ore than 50 m iles f rom any surgical abortion 
provider (Finer & Wei, 200 9). One reason for the lack of uptake am ong private physicians may relate 
to the Mifeprex® Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) p rogram. 
 
 
The Mifeprex® REMS  program has three component s (FDA, 2016b ): 
1.   Prescribers must be certified with the program by [CONTACT_873689]  
2.   Patients must sign a P atient Agreement Form. 
3.   Mifeprex® must be dispensed to patients only in certain healthcare settings, specifically 
clinics, medical offices and hosp itals, by [CONTACT_873690] r the supervision of a certified prescriber. 
Protocol MifePharmacy201 9 Confiden tial 
Version #:1.7 Version Date: 1/9/20  Page 12 of 31 
Protocol Template © CFFT TDN   Effective: [ADDRESS_1220228] component  requires that prescribers stock the medication in their facilities in order to 
dispense it on s ite. A qua lified clinician who ha s not  completed the certification process and 
arranged to stock the drug in his or her office cannot provide timely medication ab ortion care to a 
woman who pre sents unexpectedly. Consequently, treatment of such a patient would be de layed, 
which m ight increase he r medical risks (Bartlett et al., 2004;  Mifeprex REMS St udy Group, 2017) . 
 
 
We r ecently explored this issue in a survey of practicing obstetricians-gyneco logists (Grossman et al ., 
2017). In 2016 -2017, w e performed a survey with a representative sample of Fellows of the A merican 
College of Obstetricians and G yneco logists. The survey was sent by [CONTACT_172188] , and 
non-responde rs were mailed pa per surveys. 1,284 c urrently practicing Fellows responde d to the 
survey (response rate 54%). 99% reported seeing patients of reproductive age; among these, 
1,155 w ere included in this analysis. 75% reported having a patient in the prior year who ne eded o r 
wanted an abortion. Only 23% (95% CI 21%-25%) reported performing an abor tion in the prior 
year; 10% provided s urgical and m edication abortion, 9% surgical only, and 4%  medication on ly. 
 
 
Among those not providing m edication abortion, 19% said they would provide the method if they 
could write a prescription for mifepristone and their patients could obtain the m edication at a 
pharmacy. An addi tional 18% said they were unsure if they would provide medication abortion in 
this scenario. Our findings suggest that the proportion of obstetrician-gyneco logists providing 
medication w ould at least double (from 14% to 29%) if the dispensing restriction in the REMS 
were removed and phy sicians could write a p rescription for Mifeprex® that could be dispensed at a 
pharmacy. 
 
 
Given this evidence that the dispensing requirement represents a barrier to access, we propose to 
perform a study of the feasibility of pharmacy dispensing of Mifeprex®. For this study, all clinical 
activities wil l remain consistent with the current standard of care and M ifeprex® REMS pro gram 
excep t for the dispensing of Mifeprex®. In particular, patients will be evaluated for all 
contraindications to the method a ccording to the label, and they will sign the Patient Agreement Form. 
A clinician who has completed the Prescriber Agreement Form  will write a prescription for Mifeprex® 
[ADDRESS_1220229]. The patient will then take the 
Mifeprex® at the time indicated by [CONTACT_172189]. P atients will be c ontacted on D ay [ADDRESS_1220230] clinical 
follow-up. In addi tion, w e will perform surveys and interviews with pha rmacists before and after 
initiating the study, as well as monitor  the num ber of pharmacists who  refuse to dispense 
Mifeprex® at the study pharmacies. 
 
2 STU DY RATIONALE 
 
The proposed study aims to investigate the feasibility, accep tability, and e ffectiveness o f pharmacy 
dispensing of Mifeprex®; safety data will also be collected. Because of the da ta reviewed abo ve that 
indicate that the dispensing restrictions on Mifeprex® limit the number of providers of medication 
abortion, the results of this study e ventually could lead to cha nges in the Mifeprex® REMS th at would 
improve access to legal, safe abortion services in the U S. 
 
 
Trained pharmacists already successfully deliver care related to stigmatized he alth cond itions, 
including sexually transmitted infections, family planning, and e mergency  contraception. In addi tion,

 pharmacy dispensing of mifepristone is already a reality in other coun tries, such as Australia, wh ere it 
has improved acces s to medication abortion, particularly in rural areas  (D. Grossman &  Goldstone, 
2015); pharmacy dispensing of mifepristone is also being implemented in Canada (OCP, 201 7). 
 
 
Pharmacy dispensing of Mifeprex® by [CONTACT_873691] a n umber of important ways. Pharmacy dispensing in the US cou ld allow 
women to by[CONTACT_172174], financial, or insurance obstacles to clinic-based care and receive 
abortion care earlier in pregnancy ( Drey et al., 2006; D. A. Grossman et  al., 2013 ; Jerman et  al., 
2017)  and he lp to facilitate provision of  medication abortion through telemedicine, reducing the 
disparity in access be tween rural and urban settings (D. Grossman et al ., 2011; D. A. Grossman et  
al., 2013). In light of a declining number of abortion pr oviders in the US  (Jones & Kooistra, 2011,  
Jones & Jerman, 2014 ), pha rmacy dispensing could also help increase the number of clinicians w illing 
and a ble to provide medication abo rtion by [CONTACT_873692]. 
 
Pharmacy dispensing of mifepristone would not affect the standard of care or r ecommended c linical 
protocol for medication abortion in terms of the m edication, dosage, tim ing, and follow-up ca re. 
Mifeprex® would also still be prescribed to patients by [CONTACT_873682]® following the current standard assessment of eligibility for medication abortion. The onl y 
difference in the provision model to be evaluated in this study is that the patient would obtain the 
mifepristone directly from the pha rmacist, rather than in a clinic facility. This model would likely not 
add an  additional step for most women, si nce in most settings they go to a pha rmacy for pa in 
medications and a nti-emetics, and sometimes for the misoprostol. 
 
 
As not ed abov e, hom e administration of Mifeprex® is now allowed un der the updated Mifeprex® 
labeling (FDA, 2016a ). Study participants will be told by [CONTACT_172192] t hey shou ld 
take the Mifeprex®,  and p articipants will be contact[CONTACT_873693]. 
 
2.1 Risk  / Benefit Assess ment 
 
Potential medical risks to medication ab ortion patients participating in the study are the same as t hose 
they would incur by [CONTACT_172194] a medication abortion outside of the study. Because they are 
unde rgoing the same clinical assessment prior to obtaining medication abortion, there is no reason to 
believe that dispensing of Mifeprex® by [CONTACT_172195].  In 
addition, pa tients will be given de tailed information about warning signs, such as heavy bleeding that 
shou ld prompt them to seek care. 
 
The main risk related to the study is that the patient may not take Mifeprex® at the time they are told 
to—and p otentially that they may take it later than [ADDRESS_1220231] currently since the 
Mifeprex® label allows them to take the m edication at hom e, and there is no reason to believe that the 
risks will increase due to the study. Patients will also be surveyed on Day  2 to be cer tain they took the 
Mifeprex® as instructed. Women who do no t return for follow-up at  the clinic will be c ontacted by  
[CONTACT_873694] t abortion completion and a dverse ev ents. Other potential 
risks include any  social risks involved if information they reveal about their seeking an ab ortion or 
other sensitive issues were to be disclosed ou tside of the research. 
 
There are minimal risks to pharmacists for participating in the study. Pharmacists who refuse to 
dispense Mifeprex® will not have any  consequences to their employment. The participating

 pharmacies will not be identified in any publications. There  is a potential risk that participating

6.1 Study Population  
 
Patient participants will include wom en age 15 or  older (18 or older at Kaiser) s eeking medication 
abortion t hrough 70 da ys (10 w eeks) gestation and eligible for Mifeprex® at a study clinical site. The 
study will include women who are  eligible for medication abortion and are willing and able to con sent 
to participation, including being willing  to go to the study pharmacy to obt ain Mifeprex®. We w ill 
include m inors age 15-17 becau se their perspectives on this service are important; in add ition the study 
intervention is very simple and not  burdensome. In bot h [LOCATION_004] (Cal Family Code 692 0-6929)  and 
Washington State (RCW 9 .02.100 (2)), a dolescent minors are able to give cons ent to an abo rtion 
without parental consent. UCSF’s, Kaiser ’s, and U niversity of Washington’s Institutional Review 
Boards (IRBs)  consider legal ability to cons ent for care as the standard for ability to con sent to 
participate in research. W e include o nly women who com municate in English or Span ish to ensure that 
our study team can c ommunicate clearly with par ticipants and they can understand a nd con sent to 
study activities. Participants must also be willing and able to be contact[CONTACT_873698], telephone, o r text 
message as t hose are our planne d strategies for data collection. 
 
Pharmacist participants will include any pharmacist working at one o f the study pharmacy sites 
during the study who is willing to participate in the study. All pharmacists employed at the 
pharmacy sites will have a choice about participating in the research in terms of dispensing 
mifepristone and receiving the training, and in terms of completing the interviews/surveys. We 
have confirmed that there is at leas t one pharmacist at the site who is willing to dispense 
mifepristone. The baseline survey asks pharmacists if they plan to dispense mifepristone during 
the study. This will alert the research team if any pharmacists at a site say they do not plan to 
dispense, however, the research team will keep this information confidential. All pharmacists will 
be invited to the initial study training which will take place after baseline data collection. 
Pharmacists will be told that in order to dispense mifepristone they  must receive the study 
training. (Remote training can be provided for interested pharmacists who were not able to attend 
the in -person session.) By [CONTACT_873699], we will have an idea of how many pharmacists will 
not be participating in the study dispensing. All trainings for pharmacists will include schedule 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_873670].  At the end of the training, pharmacists will be asked again 
whether they plan to dispense mifepristone during the study, as a check to assess whether sites 
may have any scheduling issues. We may also follow up with a lead  pharmacist or pharmacy 
manager to confirm availability  of trained pharmacists and work out a system for ensuring 
mifepristone is available to patients. We will conduct periodic check ins with the pharmacy 
manager/lead pharmacist since pharmacy staffing th roughout the study period may fluctuate. Any 
new pharmacists will be reached with the study consent and baseline survey and the research team 
will provide training to interested pharmacists (remote training as needed).  Our periodic check -ins 
can also assess how smoothly the study is running at the pharmacy and whether any pharmacists

 7.2 Prohibited Medications 
 
As not ed in the Mifeprex® label, although spe cific drug or food interactions w ith Mifeprex® have not  
been studied, o n the basis of this drug’s metabolism by [CONTACT_097] 3A4, it is possible that k etocona zole, 
itracona zole, erythromycin, and g rapefruit juice m ay inhibit its m etabolism (i ncreasing serum 
conce ntrations o f Mifeprex®). Mifeprex® should be used with caution in patients currently or recently 
treated w ith CY P 3A4 inhibitors; however, these medications w ill not be p rohibited. 
 
CYP 3A4 inducers such as rifampin, dexa methasone, St. John’s Wort, and certain anticonv ulsants 
(such as pheny toin, phe nobarbital, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) may induce  Mifeprex® metabolism (lowering 
serum conce ntrations of mifepristone). Whether this action has an impact on the ef ficacy of the 
regimen is unk nown. As with all patients, it is important to verify that treatment was su ccessful. 
Again, CY P 3A4 inducers will not be p rohibited. 
 
Based on in vitro inhibition information, coad ministration of Mifeprex® may lead to an increase in 
serum conce ntrations of drugs that are CYP 3A4 sub strates. Due to the slow elimination of Mifeprex® 
from  the body, such interaction m ay be obs erved for a prolonged pe riod after its administration. 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when Mifeprex® is administered w ith drugs that are CYP 3A4 
substrates and have a na rrow therapeutic range; how ever, drugs that are CYP 
3A4 sub strates will not be prohibited. 
 
[ADDRESS_1220243] procedures for 
medication abortion at the site will be performed before recruitment , including completing the abo rtion 
consent and D anco Patient Agreement. 
 
If she is eligible for medication abortion, a fter all procedures other than dispensing medications, she 
will be given a brief description of the study by [CONTACT_873701].  A flyer will be po sted in the clinic waiting room and/ or examination room 
and may be given to patients in advance of the abortion consent  to inform pa tients about the study (see 
Append ix A). The patient  will be told that the study will involve obt aining all medications at the 
pharmacy, rather than ob taining some medications at the clinic and some at the pha rmacy.  She w ill be 
told that only a lim ited number of pharmacies are able to dispense Mifeprex® and given information 
about how to get to the participating pharmacy (as well as the hours during which a participating 
pharmacist will be working, if needed) . If there are any gaps in staffing at the pharmacy, the patient 
will be notified of the timing of those gaps in coverage before leaving the clinic via the pharmacy 
directions/handout. If this will be an issue for the patient, a solution will be found at the clinic before 
the patient leaves or she will not be enrolled in the study. Patients will be told that if they have any 
problems accessing the medications at the clinic, they should come back to the clinic. All except one of 
our pharmacies is located with in the same building as the clinic and a [ADDRESS_1220244] 
of M ifeprex® and misoprostol will be paid for by [CONTACT_1758] , but the payment for the abortion service 
will not differ from standard practice . The participant will  be told that participation also involves

 completing an on line survey the following day and ano ther survey approximately 2 weeks later (both of 
which may also be  performed ov er the phone i f she prefers). If the patient is interested and e ligible to 
participate in the study, she will undergo signed informed cons ent (Appendi x B) on paper  or on an 
iPad, by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_325900], including H IPAA Authorization (Appendix O). After consent, the 
patients will complete a secure electronic form ( on either a paper form or on an iPad; Append ix C) to 
submit their co ntact information a nd contact [CONTACT_873702] -up on the Day [ADDRESS_1220245] not  been contact[CONTACT_873703]-up sur vey AND  they did not return to the 
clinic site by 6 weeks after the m edication abortion visit. 
 
8.2 Method  of Recru itment for Pharmacists 
 
All pharmacists at the study pharmacies will be eligible. Pha rmacists will be invited to participate in 
the survey/interview p rior to initiating the study and at the end of the study by [CONTACT_6968]/flyer and through 
face-to-face v isits by [CONTACT_464] (see draft email in Appen dix D). We will obtain the email addresses 
of pharmacists when we visit the pharmacy to introduce and launch the study. Pharmacists will 
voluntarily provide their email addresses. All pharmacists employed by [CONTACT_873704] a 
choice about participatin g in the research in terms of dispensing mifepristone and receiving the 
training, and in terms of completing the interviews/surveys. In the baseline survey, they will be asked 
whether they plan to dispense mifepristone when the pharmacy begins offering it. All pharmacists will 
be invited to a training and study launch to take place at their pharmacy. The training/study launch will 
invol ve the UCSF PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or site PI [INVESTIGATOR_873671]. They will also receive a binder of resource materials for the 
study, which they can refer to for further information thr oughout the study period.  
A pharmacist can participate in up to two surveys (baseline and endline) and two interviews (baseline 
and endline) but may decline to participate in any. We  expect that there may be staffing changes from 
the beginning of the study  to the end, so some may participate only in baseline data collection or only 
endline data collection. The survey includes a question asking if pharmacists would be willing to 
participate in an interview. Only those who respond "yes" will be contact[CONTACT_873705].   The 
informed consent (Appendix E) will be used at beginning of the study to describe all of the study 
activities, including the baseline survey and interview , the endline survey and interview, and the 
training and dispensing . The consent will be used again at the end of the study before the endline 
survey and interview . The consent document for the pharmacists will not record the pharmacists' 
names or the names of the pharmacy, however we will program the surveys so that each pharmacy has 
a different link. This is how we will know which pharmacy respondents are from. It will also alert us if 
someone from a certain pharmacy does NOT consent to the training (identifying possible scheduling 
needs at this site). While not linked with survey responses, we do also collect email in the pharmacy 
survey in order to send a gift card. We have added a question asking if it is okay to contact [CONTACT_873706]. 
The consent includes language asking if pharmacists consent to audio recor ding of the interview. Since 
the interview may not happen immediately after the consent, we will confirm and document that 
pharmacists consent to audio recording before beginning the interview. Pharmacists can still 
participate in the study even if they de cline the audio recording. Interviews w ill be scheduled at a 
conv enient time when they  do no t interfere with the ph armacists’ work. 
The consent will also include description of the training and ask whether the pharmacist consents to 
the training.

Mifeprex® that Danco Laboratories has established. In the signed Prescriber Agreement, the site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_873672]® will be shipped. This distribution 
system is considered to be secure, confidential and controlled. UCSF will buy the medication and ship 
to the site.  
 
The pharmacy site will ensure that the Mifeprex® stock is kept separate from all other drug 
inventories maintained by [CONTACT_172215]. All study Mifeprex® received  and dispensed  at the 
pharmacy site w ill be recorded on the Investigational Drug Accoun tability Log. The stock of 
misoprostol and pain medications should not be affected by [CONTACT_15365], as their stocking and 
dispensing procedures will be done according to standard practice.  
 
8.4.1 Dosag e/Dosage  Regimen and A dministration  
 
Subjects will receive 200 m g of Mifeprex® to be taken orally at the time indicated by [CONTACT_42036]’s

complete the survey after going to the pharmacy to obtain Mifeprex®. If a participant prefers, or if she 
does not respond to the email link, she  may be contact[CONTACT_190639] e to complete the survey over the 
phone  or sent reminders by [CONTACT_20815].  The survey will focus on h er experience in the pharmacy, 
including how she was treated and the information she  received, as we ll as her expe rience taking the 
Mifeprex®.  If the pa rticipant went to a pharmacy that was not her usual pharmacy, we will ask about 
her perspective on ha ving to go to a di fferent pharmacy.  We will also collect information about if and 
when  the M ifeprex® and m isoprostol and if the M ifeprex® might ha ve been d iverted to another person.  
If they do not  respond to the survey by [CONTACT_2006] 4, pa rticipants will contact[CONTACT_873708] (each day for 
three subsequent days to complete the survey). If a participant has decided no t to proceed with medication 
abortion (because she has decided to have a su rgical abortion or continue the pregnancy or because she 
needs more time to decide), she w ill be encou raged to complete the Day 2 sur vey, where this information 
will be captured. If a woman obtained the Mifeprex® and/or misoprostol and has decided not to take the 
medication(s), she w ill be as ked to return them to the ph armacy or the clinic. 
 
10.3 Clinical follow-up 
 
Women unde rgoing medication abo rtion generally undergo clinical follow-up to ensure that the 
abortion is complete. This may include a follow-up visit or a phon e call from  clinic staff 
approximately 7-14 da ys after the initial visit.  In som e cases, serum hCG may be measured on the day

11   EVALUATIONS  – PHAR MACISTS 
 
11.1 Baseline  Survey/Interview  
 
Each o f the pharmacists at the study sites wi ll be invited to participate in a survey and i nterview p rior 
to the initiation of Mifeprex® dispensing.  This survey and i nterview w ill focus on b aseline 
knowledge of medication abortion, comfort with dispensing Mifeprex®, anticipated ch allenges of 
dispensing Mifeprex®, and whether the respondent plans to refuse to participate in Mifeprex® 
dispensing (and why ). The survey may be co mpleted on pape r or online (see Appendix J), and the 
pharmacists will provide verbal or click-through cons ent to the survey and interview ( Appendix E). 
Only pharmacists who indicate on the survey that they would be willing to participate in a follow -
up interview will be contact[CONTACT_272510]. The interview , which may  be pe rformed in person o r 
over the ph one a nd wi ll be recorded if participants agree, will allow for co llection of qualitative data

12   ADVERSE  EXPERIE NCE RE PORTI NG AND DOC UMENTATION  
 
12.1 Adverse  Events 
 
Adverse Events (AEs) are to be reported only for untoward medical events that occur in participants 
after they have enrolled in the study.  Only new untow ard events, or a worsening of an existing 
cond ition, a re considered A Es.  C onditions that were present before enrollment into the study, and t hat 
remain stable or improve duri ng the study, are not considered A Es.  Only serious or unexpected AEs 
that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the research will be submitted to the UCSF IRB. 
Diversion of Mifeprex® obtained in the study to someone other than the participant will also be 
considered an AE.  
 
Information regarding AEs or  SAEs m ay be first obtained by  [CONTACT_172226], as both will 
communicate with the participant at her visits and by  [CONTACT_648].  
 
Details abou t each AE o r SAE will be recorded on an AE/SA E Form  (Append ix N). This form will 
require the following information t o be collected:  diagnosis, ons et date, resolution date, source of 
information, severity, treatment given, relationship to the study, action taken, and comments. 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_873675], p robably 
unrelated, p ossibly related, or unrelated; and the severity of the AE  as mild, m oderate or severe.  For 
AEs or SAEs that have not  resolved at  the time of learning of the event, the study team will monitor 
the event until the event is resolved or the study is completed. 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_873676] (IRBs).  All 
AEs that are related to the study and a re seri ous or affect IRB appr oval will be reported by  [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_873677].  UCSF requires that an internal (on-site) AE that the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_172159] s erious o r unexpected shall be reported within 5 w orking days 
of the UCSF P I’s knowledge. External (off-site) AE’s that chan ge the study risks/benefits or requires a 
UCSF IRB modifi cation must be reported w ithin 10 working days of the UCSF P I’s knowledge.  
Diversion of Mifeprex® will be reported to the FDA within 15 days of the UCSF PI’s knowledge. 
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient 
administered a pha rmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a cau sal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and un intended  sign 
(including an abnor mal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated w ith 
the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  An unexpe cted AE is one of  a type no t identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency  in the current Mifeprex® label or of greater severity or freque ncy 
than exp ected ba sed on the information in the label.

 The following definitions a pply to adv erse events occurring in clinical studies involving drugs: 
 
•  An AE is any health-related reaction, e ffect, toxicity or abnor mal laboratory result 
that a pa rticipant experiences during the co urse of the study, irrespective of 
relationship to study pr oduct use. 
 
In this study, the following routine study measurements will not be considered A Es 
because they a re anticipated participant outcomes: 
 
• 
 Ab
ortion 
 
•  Symptoms associated w ith medication abo rtion (pain, vaginal bleeding, fever, chills, 
nausea, vomiting, heada che, weakness, dizziness and diarrhea), unless they are so 
severe as to meet the criteria for a SAE (see section 12.2 below) 
 
12.1.1   AE Seve rity 
 
The National Cancer Institute’s Common T erminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE  severity, including laboratory 
abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. Tab le 1 below should be us ed to grade 
severity.  It shoul d be poi nted ou t that the term “severe” is a m easure of intensity and that a 
severe AE  is not necessarily serious. 
 
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
 
Seve rity (Toxicity Grade) Description 
Mild (1) Transient or mild di scomfort; no limitation in activity; no m edical 
intervention or therapy required. The su bject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well. 
Mode rate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or  minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hosp italizations possible. 
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due  to the adverse experience a s it 
occu rred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have cau sed de ath if it were more severe.

drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and 
that is unlikely to be explained by  [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical 
state or by [CONTACT_82978]. 
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by  a num ber of other factors. 
Unrelated An event that can b e determined wi th certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug. 
 
12.2 Serious  Adve rse Eve nts (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: 
 
•  Is life threatening or results in death. 
 
•  Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172160]. 
 
•  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
 
•  Is a cong enital abno rmality/birth defect (in the offspring of a pa rticipant). 
 
•  Jeopardizes participant and required medical/surgical intervention to prevent 
serious ou tcome, or 
 
•  Any other event that the investigator considers serious. 
 
12.2.1 Serious  Adve rse Ev ent Reporting  
 
Study  sites will docu ment all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per  
UCSF IRB Guidelines. The collection period for all SAEs wi ll begin after informed cons ent 
is obtained and end six weeks after the visit where Mifeprex® is prescribed.

13   DISCONTINU ATION AN D REPLACEMENT  OF SUBJECTS  
 
13.1 Early  Disc ontinuation of Study D rug 
 
Because participants will only take a single dos e of Mifeprex®, there will be n o opportunity to 
discontinue treatment.  If a pa tient vomits wi thin 30 m inutes after taking Mifeprex®, she  will be 
instructed to return to the clinic site for further evaluation and m anagement. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_1220260]’s best interest to con tinue. 
 
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspe cified, and w ithout prejudice. 
 
Reason able attempts will be made by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_506055] a reason for subject withdrawals.  The 
reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the subject’s data collection 
docum ents.

endpo int criteria.  Po tential protocol violations for this study include, bu t are not limited to, the 
following: 
 
• Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 
• Failure to comply with G ood Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_50366] a 
protocol violation will result in withdrawal of a subject. 
 
When  a protocol violation occu rs, it will be d iscussed with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a  Protocol Violation Form  
detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] t he site PI. A copy  of 
the form will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in the PI’s files. 
 
15   DATA SA FETY MONITOR ING 
 
Safety oversight will be under the direction of the PI. Because Mifeprex® is already approved, and 
there is a great deal of safety data on its use for this approved indication, we think it is reasonable for 
safety monitor ing to occur  through the standard review of S /AE reports (see section 12).

more than 4 hour s or for any signs of  complications. 
 
16   STATI STIC AL METHODS  AND CONSIDERATI ONS 
 
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) wi ll be written 
describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifi cations to the 
analysis plan described below.

16.2 Demographic and Baseline Charac teristics  
 
The demographic information that will be collected: Age, parity, race/ethnicity. At the initial visit, we 
will also collect: date of service, gestational age by [CONTACT_2207] a nd da te of ultrasound, p ast medical 
history, current medications, b lood pressure, weight, height, and m edications p rescribed or dispensed. 
All participants will receive the same dos e of Mifeprex®. 
 
16.3 Analysis  of Primary Endp oint 
 
Feasibility of the pha rmacy d ispensing model will be assessed in quantitative descriptive analyses of 
satisfaction variables from the pha rmacists’ end line survey (overall satisfaction, perceived 
bene fits/challenges, and ease of implementation of  phar macy dispensing) using chi-squar e and  t tests 
where appropriate. We will also calculate the proportion of pharmacists who  refused to dispense 
Mifeprex® during the study. In addi tion, feasibility will be assessed in qualitative anal yses of open 
ended interviews wi th pha rmacists about dispensing Mifeprex® in pha rmacies. 
 
16.[ADDRESS_1220263] knowledge about  medication abo rtion before and  after the intervention w ill 
be assessed through quantitative analyses of surveys c ompleted by  [CONTACT_873712]. 
 
Adverse event rates will be coded by  [CONTACT_873713] M edDra classification term. Adverse events 
will be tabulated and wi ll include the num ber of patients for whom the event occur red, the rate of 
occu rrence, and the severity and r elationship to study drug.

16.6 Sample  Size 
 
We a im to recruit 350 patients for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], w hich is a feasible sample at the study s ites. With 
a sample size of 350, if the proportion of patients with a complete abortion is 95%, the 95%  
confidence interval of that proportion will be +2. 7%. Abortion com pletion is an important clinical 
outcome. 
 
We a im to sur vey all the pharmacists at the study sites, up to 50. This sample size will be 
determined by  [CONTACT_873714]. We have confirmed that there is 
at least one pharmacy at the site who is willing to dispense mifepristone, which is sufficient 
for the study. In the unlikely event that a willing and trained pharmacist is not on site to 
dispense the medication, the patien t will be told when she can return to the pharmacy to 
have the prescription filled. Alternatively, the patient may return to the clinic, where the 
mifepristone will be dispense. If that happens, the study will still cover the cost of the 
medication abortion, but the patient will be discontinued from the study.

Since Mi feprex® is not generally a covered benefit for pharmacy dispensing, we do no t anticipate that 
pharmacies will be able to bill insurances for their standard dispensing fee, so this will be provided as  
part of the study. 
 
The study will cover the cost of the medication abortion services for all participants at UCSF, UC 
Davis, and UCSD. The study will cover the costs of the M ifeprex®, misoprostol, and associated 
dispensing fee s at Kaiser , University  of W ashington , and Planned Parenthood Tacoma .

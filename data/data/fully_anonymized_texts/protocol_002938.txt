Background and Rationale  
Approximately 4% of people in the US are either deaf or hard of hearing1, equating to 
more than [ADDRESS_13029] of hearing5-10. Our 
goal is to complete the development of a transparent surgical N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13520].  
Objectives  
The investigators will recruit adult participants to complete a usability survey on a 
transparent surgical N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] (i.e., FaceView mask) designed to improve 
communication. The study aims to gather participants’ perceptions of the novel 
transparent s urgical N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13522]. a conventional surgical N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521]. Following 
fitting of the masks ( up to 30  minutes wear time each), the participants will complete a 
questionnaire to provide their perceptions of fit, comfort, ease of use, and benefit  to 
communication.

Protocol template version dated 10.27.2020  Study Design  and Procedures  
For both objectives, participants will try on both the FaceView  Mask ™ and the 
conventional surgical N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13523] -random order from participant to participant. 
The participants will be informed that both masks meet N95 standards. The participants 
will be fit tested for both masks to ensure that the appropriate siz e is used. Training for fit 
testing will be performed by [CONTACT_13535], LLC personnel using a standard fit 
testing kit (3M ™ Qualitative Fit Test Kit, Sweet) and  the PI (and hired graduate student) 
will apply this fitting technique  to all part icipants. The participants will wear each mask for 
up to 30  minutes before completing the study survey. All surgical respi[INVESTIGATOR_13524].  Important requirements before fit testing include:  
• No participants with facial hair should be included in the fit testing study.  
• All participants (test subjects and administrators) should view the video at 
http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/992396O/3m -respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] -fit-kit-test-
video.mp4  before beginning the study.  
• Test subjects must not eat, drink (other than plain water), smoke, or chew gum in 
the [ADDRESS_13030].  
 
Study Population  
A goal of 200 participants is desired with a minimum of 125 to meet study targets. We will 
be contact[CONTACT_13536] (not cold contacts) with ability to share study brochure by 
e-mail:  
1) across the UAMS campus (e.g., College Deans, Center Directors, Program 
Directors);  
2) surrounding clinics;  
3) American Sign Language interpreter education at the University of Arkansas at 
Little Rock (Program Director)  
4) Arkansas School for the Deaf (Superintendent and/or Assistant to the 
Superintendent); and  
5) Communications Plus+ Interpreter Services, Inc. (owner and operator)  
 
In the event that recruitment numbers are low in Little Rock, AR, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_13525], CA, Ann Arbor, MI, and [COMPANY_002]ster, NY who belong to the healthcare 
community, Deaf and hard of hearing community, or both.  If needed, recruiters at the se 
three additional  sites will be hired to re cruit 25 participants per site. Approvals for IRB 
amendments will be sought, and if necessary, IRB approvals will be obtained at those 
additional sites.  
Compensation  
The participants will each receive a $[ADDRESS_13031] as compensation for their participation 
in the study. As the subjects’ active participation in this study ends with the completion of 
the survey, there is no retention plan.

Protocol template version dated 10.27.2020  Inclusion Criteria  
• Study participants must be at least [ADDRESS_13032] no health conditions that 
would prevent them from safely wearing an N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] (e.g., severe asthma, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), read in English and communicate in 
English or American Sign Language , and be able to provide or arrange their own 
transportation to the study location.  
• The ages of the participants are expected to reflect the demographics of the 
healthcare workforce from which they will be recruited (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 18 -65 years).  
• There will not be any exclusion of subjects based on racial/ethnic background. It 
is expected that the races and ethnicities represented in these studies will reflect 
the overall demographics of the workforce involved.  
Exclusion Criteria  
• Prospective participants with facial hair.  
• Children are to be excluded from the proposed research project because the 
current FaceView Mask ™ is designed for adults.  
• Adults who are non -English communicators.  
• Any adult with health conditions that would prevent them from safely wearing an 
N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] (e.g., severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  
Risks and Benefits  
When testing surgical mask that makes contact [CONTACT_13537], there is the 
potential for study participants to experience an allergic reaction to the mask material.  
 
N95-grade surgical respi[INVESTIGATOR_13526], and 
there is the potential for study participants to experience some  restricted airflow.  
 
The information obtained from the participants will not jeopardize them in any way and 
will be deidentified.  
 
The information obtained through this product testing study will inform the final design of 
a novel transparent surgical N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13527]. Therefore, the participants are likely to benefit from the 
product that the proposed research supports.  
 
There are no transparent surgical N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13528]. Successful 
testing of the FaceView Mask ™ surgical N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_13529] N95 -grade surgical respi[INVESTIGATOR_13530] (e.g., when there 
is a risk of exposure to  respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531]). Healthcare workers with hearing difficulties 
and those working in noisy environments may also benefit from this nove l surgical N95 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521]. The FaceView Mask ™ is designed to improve communication and reduce the 
risk of medical errors. The inclusion of an antimicrobial coating on the FaceView Mask ™ 
will provide additional protection against respi[INVESTIGATOR_13532]:   Product Testing of the FaceView Mask ™: Usability Survey

Date:  1.13.[ADDRESS_13033] to this novel N95 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] (e.g., size, shape, fit, and comfort) will improve the effectiveness of the design 
and lead to a significant advance in personal protective equipment (PPE).  
 
Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_13533], and completed surveys will not collect personal 
identifying information or PHI. Therefore, the data are already de -identified/anonymized 
and untraced back to the participant.

the quality of the data and the integrity of the study.   
At the conclusion of the study, the data will be retained and remain  
deidentified /anonymous , and later destroyed in accordance with institutional policy . 
 
Data Analysis  
As this is a product survey, and not a treatment or intervention project, all data  will be 
reported using descriptive statistics in the aggregate.  
 
Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations 
and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences research policies and 
procedures.   This protocol and any amendments will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_13538] (IRB) to conduct the study.    
This is a minimal risk study and a waiver of documentation of consent is requested. The 
research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects and the only record linking 
the subject and the study would be the consent document and the principal risk is the 
breach of confidentiality.   
The study team will recruit via word of mouth and by [CONTACT_13539]. The study will be fully explained to the participant prior 
to engaging in any activities. All participants will be given a copy of the study brochure 
for their records. St udy participation will be taken as agreement to participate.  
 
Dissemination of Data  
Results of this study may be used for presentations, posters, or publications. The 
publications will not contain any identifiable information that could be linked to a 
participant.

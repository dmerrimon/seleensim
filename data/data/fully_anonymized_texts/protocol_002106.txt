the Safety and Efficacy of DFD -03 Lotion in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris for 
12 Weeks  
Sponsor:    [CONTACT_23015]’s Laboratories, Ltd  
  8-2-337, Road No. 3  
  Banjara Hills  
 Hyderabad – 500034, Telangana, India  
Study Centers:  25 to 35 sites  Number of Subjects:  Approximately 550  
Study Period:  12 weeks  Clinical Phase:  Phase 3  
Objective:  
The objective s of this study are to compare the efficacy and safety of DFD -[ADDRESS_1104911] s with  acne vulgaris after 12  weeks of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786].  
Methods:   
This will be a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, vehicle -controlled  study .  
Subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be randomized to either of the two arms 
in a 1:1 ratio:  
Arm 1: DFD -03 Lotion  
Arm 2: Vehicle Lotion   
Enrollment of subjects with mild acne (IGA Grade 2) at each site will be restricted to no more 
than 20% of total enrollment at that site. Subjects with acne lesions of any severity on the chest 
and/or back (including shoulders)  may be enrol led provided they have mild to moderate acne on 
the face. During the [ADDRESS_1104912]  twice daily 
with approximately 12 hours between applications. Subjects will be instru cted to treat the entire 
face (and chest /back  including shoulders , if applicable ). The investigator will assess efficacy by 
[CONTACT_112948] ’s Global Assessment scale (IGA 5-point  scale) and by [CONTACT_800523]-inflammatory  lesions on the face at Baseline  and Weeks  4, 8, 
and 12. Lesion counts will also be done for the chest /back  (including shou lders) , where  
applicable . The IGA should always be done prior to lesion counts.  
 
Safety assessments will include the investigator’s assessment of local cutaneous tolerance of the 
treated skin  (dryness , non -lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and  itching ; assessed 
separately on the chest/back  including shoulders  (if applicable ), vital signs (blood pressure and 
pulse rate) , and adverse events  (AEs) . Urine pregnancy tes ts will be performed at Baseline and 
at every visit through Week  12 for all female  subjects.  A physical examination will be 
performed at the Baseline Visit.

Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -[ADDRESS_1104919], Dose and Mode of Administrati on: 
DFD -03 Lotion (0.1% tazarotene)  
 
Subjects will apply a quarter (U.S coin) size amount of the study product all over the moistened 
face and rub  it into the skin until foamy . Care should be taken to avoid the areas around the 
eyes, mouth, and nostrils. Additional [ADDRESS_1104920] may be used 
over other affected areas (chest and/or back, including shoulders) . After being left on for [ADDRESS_1104921] by [CONTACT_800524] t 
30 seconds.  This procedure will be followed twice daily , in the morning and at bedtime, 
approximately 12 hours apart.  
 
Duration of Treatment and Study:  
Subjects will treat the entire face , including the nose (and chest and/or back , including 
shoulders , if applicable) twice daily for 12 weeks. The total study duration including the 
screening period will be approximately 12  to 20  weeks.  
 
Reference and Control Products, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Vehicle : DFD -03 Vehicle Lotion (0% tazarotene)  
 
The control product will be applied similarly to the study product as described above.  
 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety criteria:  
The primary safety endpoint will be treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Other s afety 
variables include  local cutaneous tolerance evaluation  (dryness , non -lesional erythema, peeling, 
stinging, burning, and  itching ) and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) .   
Efficacy criteria:  
The co -primary endpoints are:  
 The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12  in the inflammatory (papules and 
pustules)  lesion counts on the face  
 The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the  non-inflammatory  (open and 
closed comedones) lesion counts  on the face  
 Proportion of subject s with a clinical response of “success” at  Week 12  for lesions on the 
face. Success based on IGA is defined as an IGA score of 0 (Clear)  or 1 (Almost clear)  
at Week [ADDRESS_1104922] a 2 -grade reduction from B aseline .   
 
The secondary endpoints  are: 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflam matory lesion counts on the face .  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the 
face.  
 
The exploratory e ndpoints  are: 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05)

Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 8 of 62 
1. Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the face.  
2. Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks [ADDRESS_1104923] a 2 -grade reduction (for 
the face) from Baseline at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
5. Change from Baseline in Children’s DLQI total score in subjects 16  years of age or 
younger at Weeks 4 , 8, and 12. 
6. Change from Baseline in DLQI score  in subjects >[ADDRESS_1104924] and /or back  including shoulders  (in relevant subjects ) at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.  
8. Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the chest and /or back  (including 
shoulders) . 
9. Proportion of subjects with at least a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline in the SGA  at 
Week 12.   
10. Change from Baseline in CADI score at Weeks 4 , 8 and 12. 
 
If the statistical analysis for  all the co -primary endpoints  achieves p<0.05, statistical analysis for 
the secondary endpoints will use a sequential  approach according to a pre -specified order: 
percent change in inflammatory lesion counts  on the face, and then p ercent change in non-
inflammatory lesion counts  on the  face. If p<0.05 is achieved for a higher ranking secondary 
variable, then success will be declared for the variable, and statistical comparisons will be 
performed for the lower ranking variable. If p<0.05 is not achieved for a higher ranking 
variable, the n statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive (non -inferential) for this 
variable and for the lower ranking secondary variable.  
The sample size was estimated based on the primary study endpoints and statistics available 
from the Summary Basis of  Approval for Tazorac® (tazarotene) Gel (NDA 20 -600). The total 
sample size  of [ADDRESS_1104925] 90% based on a 2 -tailed alpha of 
0.05. 
 
Approximately  550 subjects  (275 for each treatment arm)  will be randomized  and about 25 to 35  
sites will participate in the study

1 INTRODUCTION  
Tazarotene, an acetylenic  retinoid, is a prodrug that undergoes rapid and complete metabolism 
to its active metabolite tazarotenic acid ( Chandraratna, 1996 ). Retinoids are a class of 
keratolytic drugs derived from retinoic acid used for the treatment of acne and psoriasis. Several  
synthetic retinoids have been developed for topi[INVESTIGATOR_112929].  
Tazarotene was initially developed in gel formulation and subsequently in cream and foam 
formulations. Products containing tazarotene have been proven to be effective in the treatment 
of acne vulgaris and psoriasis, as well as being effective in the mitigation (palliation) of facial 
fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper - and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and benign facial lentigines.  
[CONTACT_23015]’ s Laboratories has developed DFD -03 Lotion, a new formul ation containing 0.1% 
tazarotene for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_112930]. This new product is intended to be used as 
a face wash twice daily. Treatment use will begin by [CONTACT_2931] a generous amount of product to 
moistened affected skin, rubbing until foa my, and then rinsing with water after 1  minute.  
Acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and 
nodular cystic lesions) and non -inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) ( Shalita, 
2004 ). The four primary f actors contributing to acne are abnormal follicular epi[INVESTIGATOR_124212], hyperactivity of the sebaceous glands, proliferation of Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] , 
and perifollicular inflammation.  
 Current ly available treatments for acne vulgaris include oral an d topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112932], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112933], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112934], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112935], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112936], 
oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_22775] (including tazarotene), and phototherapy.  
Tazarotene is a well -characterized active ingredient, an d many studies have been conducted on 
its pharmacology, toxicology and clinical efficacy and safety  (Fabior Prescribing Information , 
Tazorac Cream Prescribing Information ). 
Tazarotene is characterized by [CONTACT_4760] a Category X drug, indicating that it may  or can 
cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in women who 
are or may become pregnant  (Menter, 2000 ). At least [ADDRESS_1104936] become 
pregnant during clinical studies with tazarotene and all reported the bi rth of healthy babies, 
although the timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation time are unknown in these 
cases .  
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of DFD -03 Lotion  for topi[INVESTIGATOR_112937] 12 weeks of treatment.

4 STUDY  DESIGN  
This will be a multicenter, randomized, vehicle -controlled, double -blind, parallel -group  study . 
Approximately  550 subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio  to treatment with either  DFD -03 Lotion  or Vehicle Lotion . Enrollment of subjects with 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05)

Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 17 of 62 
mild acne (IGA Grade 2) at each site will be restrict ed to no more than 20% of total enrollment 
at that site.  During the 12 -week treatment period subjects will use the study drug twice daily 
with approximately 12 hours between applications. Subjects will be instru cted to treat the entire 
face (and chest and/ or back (including shoulders) , if applicable) . The investigator will assess 
efficacy by [CONTACT_112948] ’s Global Assessment scale (IGA , 5-point scale) and by 
[CONTACT_112949]-inflammatory  lesions on the face at Baseline and 
Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Lesion counts will also be done for the chest and/or back (including 
shoulders) , where applicable.  
The p rimary safety endpoint will be treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) . Other safety 
assessments will include the investigator’s assessment of local cutaneous tolerance  (dryness , 
non-lesional erythema, peeling, stinging , burning, and  itching ) and vital signs (blood pressure 
and pulse rate) . A physical examination will be performed at Baseline. Urine pregnancy tests 
will be performed at Baseline and at every visit through Week 12 for all female subjects.  
The co -primary efficacy endpoints are:  
 
1. The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory (papules and 
pustules)  lesion counts  on the face    
2. The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the  non-inflammatory  (open and 
closed comedones) lesion counts  on the face  
3. Proportion of subject s with a clinical response of “success” at Week 12  for lesions on the 
face. Success based on IGA is defined as a n IGA score of 0 (Clear)  or 1 (Almost clear)  
at Week  [ADDRESS_1104943] a 2-grade reduction from B aseline .   
The secondary endpoints  are: 
 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory lesion counts on the face .  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the 
face.  
The exploratory e ndpoints  are: 
 
1. Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the face.  
 
2. Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks [ADDRESS_1104944] a 2 -grade reduction (for 
the face) from Baseline at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
5. Change from Baseline in Children’s DLQI total score in subjects 16  years of age or 
younger at Weeks 4 , 8, and 12. 
6. Change from Baseline in DLQI score in subjects >[ADDRESS_1104945] and /or back  including shoulders  (in relevant subjects ) at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.

counts.  
 
7.5.1 Investigator’s  Global Assessment ( IGA) of the Face  
The IGA scale to be used in the study is a measure of static evaluation of qualitative overall 
acne severity. IGA is an ordinal scale with five severity grades (rep orted only in integers, e.g., 
0 to 4). Each grade is defined by a distinct and clinically re levant morphologic description to 
minimize inter -observer variability  (

Table  4). The grades on the scale have been sufficiently defined to appropriate ly and 
unambiguously represent each severit y grade on the scale. The investigator is required to 
perform IGA scoring at each visit.  The IGA should always be done prior to lesion counts.

some inflammatory lesions, but no more than one small nodular lesion  
4 Severe;  up to many non -inflammatory and inflammatory lesion s, but no 
more than a few nodular lesions  
 * Areas  other  than the face and nose  are not included  in assessment 
 
Enrollment of subjects with mild  acne (IGA Grade 2) at each site will be restricted to no more 
than 20% of total enrollment at that site; management of this requirement will be handled by [CONTACT_129212].  
 
7.5.2 Lesion Counts  of the Face  
Non-inflammatory  lesions (closed comedones and open comedones), inflammatory lesions 
(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions  (nodules and cysts)  on the face  (above the 
mandibular line),  including the nose, will be counted and recorded separately at each visit from 
Screening/ Baseline through Week 12. Non-inflammatory  lesions of acne are the open 
(blackheads) or closed (whiteheads) comedones. Closed comedones may b e more difficult to 
detect visually and may require stretching of the skin to aid in visualization. Inflammatory 
lesions are divided into papules, pustules, and nodules/nodulocystic lesions, depending on the 
severity and location of the inflammation within  the dermis. Nodulocystic lesions will be 
counted separately from inflammatory lesions of papules and pustules. The papules and pustules 
have surrounding halos of erythema allowing for their characterization as inflammatory. 
Nodules are typi[INVESTIGATOR_800520]/or painful. Additionally, they are deep -
seated in the skin (i.e., centered in the dermis or subcutis). Nodules have been defined as being 
greater than 5  mm in diameter. The borders of these lesions may be difficult to determine 
because of the associated erythema/inflammation. The investigator/evaluator should use 
standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systematic counting procedure to ensure 
consistent and accurate counts.  
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_1104974]’s Global Assessment  (SGA) of the Face  
The SGA of the facial skin will be conducted by [CONTACT_112968], Weeks 4, 8 , and 12

Non-inflammatory  lesions (closed comedones and open comedones), inflammatory lesions 
(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions (nodules and cysts) on the chest and /or back  
including shoulders  (if applicable) will be counted and recorded separately at each visit from 
Baseline through  Week 12.  Nodulocystic lesions will be counted separately from inflammatory 
lesions of papules and pustules.  The back  area is from most prominent cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_800521] . The chest  area is from the manubrium of the sternum superiorly to the xiph iod process  
inferiorly . The lesion types are as described above. The investigator/evaluator should use 
standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systema tic counting procedure to ensure 
consistent and accurate counts.  
 
7.5.5 DLQI  
The DLQI is a quality of life instrument that has ten questions addressing symptoms and 
feelings (Questions 1 and 2), daily activities (Questions 3 and 4), leisure (Questions 5 and 6), 
work and school (Question 7), personal relationships (Questions 8 and 9) , and treatment 
(Question 10). Each is rated from 0 to 3, such  that the maximum score is 30. The higher the 
score, the mor e quality of life is impaired. The usual clinical interpretati on of the total score is 
as follows:  
 
0 to 1 = no effect at all on subject’s life  
2 to 5 = small effect on subject’s life  
6 to 10 = moderate effect on subject’s life  
11 to 20 = very large effect on subject’s life  
21 to 3 0 = extremely large effect on subjec t’s life  
 
The adult and children’s versions of the DLQI are provided in Appendix  2 and Appendix  3, 
respectively .

7.5.6 Cardiff Acne Disability Index  (CADI)  
The CADI is a short [ADDRESS_1104976] s of 5 questions. The scoring for each question is done from 0 to 3  (a=3, b=2, c=1, d=0) . 
The CADI score is calculated by [CONTACT_37303] a possible 
maximum of 15 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is 
impaired.    
 
The CADI questionnaire is provided in Appendix 4 . 
7.6 Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments include vital signs, local cutaneous tolerance  evaluation of the treated skin,  
and AEs . Vital signs (blood pressure  and pulse) will be collected at each visit. A physical 
examination will be performed at Baseline (Day 1). Urine pregnancy tests for all female subjects 
(regardless of childbearing potential)  will be conducted at Screening and Baseline  (Day  1) and 
at each subsequent visit. Adverse events will be collected by [CONTACT_112969] 
(either verbal or re corded in the subject diary ), by [CONTACT_112970] , and by 
[CONTACT_4171] (see Section  8 for details about AEs).  Adverse events, whether believed by [CONTACT_800527], will be recorded on the eCRF . 
At Visits 2 through 5 the investigator will assess local cutaneous tolerance  by [CONTACT_112972]-lesional erythema, peeling , and dryness  that will be graded as 
shown below (Table  6, Table  7, Table  8) and recorded on the eCRF . Assessments will be 
recorded separately for the face and (if applicable) chest and /or back  (including shoulders) . The 
investigator will also ask the subject if any stinging ( Table  9), burning ( Table  10), or itching  
(Table  11) has occurred on the face  (chest and /or back  (including shoulde rs), if applicable  since 
the last visit  (for Visit [ADDRESS_1104977] 2 weeks ). Visit [ADDRESS_1104978] and/or back (including shoulders)  using the same

sensation , occurring in 10 % to 30% of subjects. Adverse reactions occurring in 1% to 5% of 
treated subject s included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging .  
The investigator is to pay special attention at each visit to any signs  of clinically significant 
dryness, non -lesional er ythema , and peeling and report  as an AE subsequent to the Baseline 
Visit  if worse than at Baseline . 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. The 
event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship w ith the study product . An AE can 
therefore be any sign, symptom, or disease, or any worsening of an existing sign, symptom, or 
disease, whether or not considered related to the study product  or trial procedures, including 
injuries.   
Any medical condition that is present at the time of Screening or Baseline should be considered 
as medical history and reported on the medical history eCRF  and should not be reported as an 
AE except for AEs observed at the Baseline V isit due to study procedures performed at the  
Screening visit , which should be reported. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing 
conditions should not be reported as AEs. Unexpected worsening of pre -existing conditions 
should be reported as AEs. The disease or condition being studied or e xpected progression, 
signs, or symptoms of the disease or condition being studied such as worsening of acne should 
not be reported as an AE unless it is more severe than expected , results in discontinuation from 
the study or requires alternat ive therapy . 
All serious adverse events  (SAEs) , all study product -related events , and all AEs leading to study 
product  discontinuation must be followed until the clinical outcome is determined or until all 
attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted  (not recovered  is not an acceptable 
outcome  for acute conditions ). For other AEs, the status at the last visit can be entered into the 
eCRF .

Vital Signs Varia bles 
Vital signs  (except at Visits 1 & 2)  should be reported as AEs if they are  out of range and  
considered to be clinically significant, as per the Investigator’s judgment.  
 
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Severity  
It is the investigator's responsibility to  assess the severity of each AE. Descriptions of severity 
are as follows:  
 
1. Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not likely to interfere with 
normal activity or require medical attention.  
2. Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. May require 
medical intervention.  
3. Severe :  Incapacitating such that  normal activity is prevented. Likely requires medical 
intervention and/or close follow -up. 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1104989]  (Causality)  
It is the investigat or’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the study product  and the 
AE. The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study product  should  be described using the 
following categories:  
 
1. Not Related : The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.). Specify if known . Or, the event is most probably  produced by [CONTACT_11259] ’s clinical state, therapeutic interv entions , or concomitant therapy and does  
not follow a known response pattern to the study product . 
2. Possibly Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use but can be 
explained by [CONTACT_11693]. Information on the effect of study product  withdrawal 
may be lacking.  
3. Probably Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study product  and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product .  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 43 of 62 
4. Definitely Related : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the tim e of 
study product  administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study  
product, and could not have been produced by [CONTACT_1605] ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic intervention , or concomitant therapy, and either oc curs imme diately 
following study  product administration or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112945], or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site.  
 
8.3.3 Seriousness  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of an AE. A serious adverse 
event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening (subject at immediate risk of death)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
4. Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeo pardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  
of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1104990] be faxed or emailed  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The 
minimum initial information required to be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Form is: the 
subject number, subject initials, the event, the causality, the date of the event , and the name [CONTACT_112990]. This initial report should be promptly followed up with a 
completed  Serious Adverse Event Form.

plans for management and further reporting (i.e. , FDA) determined.  
It is the responsibility of the CRO, Symbio LLC,  to promptly notify the IRB and other 
Investigators involved in this study about serious and unexpected SAEs for which there is a 
reasonable possibility of their being related to the investigational product.  
Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events  
All follow -up reports will be subject to the same reporting timelines as the Initial  Reports. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of new information, the updated follow -up SAE  form, along with any 
supporting documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or  autopsy reports), sh ould be faxed 
or emailed to the Sponsor.

8.6 Exposure in utero  (Pregnancy)  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product  must  be discontinued 
immediately and she must  be followed through the pregnancy and delivery . The investigator 
should repor t the event to the sponsor immediately (see contact [CONTACT_112975]) and 
complete the Pregnancy Report  Form.  The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end 
of the pregnancy should be included in this information. The investigator is instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_112976] 3 months until the end of her pregnancy and repo rt the outcome to the sponsor. 
Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy 
Report  Form.  
The following outcomes of p regnancy fall under the criteria for SAEs  and should be reported as 
such: delivery complications prolonging hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, death 
of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried fetus.

 Expi[INVESTIGATOR_800522] a subject revokes authorization to collect and use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all informat ion collected prior to th e revocation of authorization. For subjects 
who have revoked authorization to collect and use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. , that the subject is alive) at the end of their 
scheduled study period.

include all pertinent study -related information , including original signed /dated informed 
consent/  information and assent forms. Source documents for this study include all w ritten 
records of study data. All study data must have a paper source document , including investigator 
assessments.   
 
9.3 Screening/Enrollment Log  
A subject Screening/Enrollment Log, noting reasons fo r screen failure where applicable, must 
be maintained for all subjects who are consented. The log should also include subject initials, 
screening date, subject number , and date of enrollment , which is when ICF is signed , where 
applicable.   
 
9.4 Case Report Fo rms 
Database set -up will be performed by [CONTACT_800528] 
(EDC) vendor, using an appropriate fully validated, [ADDRESS_1104994] will be recorded by [CONTACT_258859] . Only authorized site 
personnel will be able to enter/modify/correct data to the eCRF . 
Approved staff at Symbio will verify all data entered into eCRF s for completeness and accuracy 
with reference to the source documents and records and will issue manual data queries to correct 
missing data or discrepancies found against the source within the EDC system.  
Data validation will consist of automated and manual e dit checks that are created directly into 
the EDC. Automated edit checks will be executed on all data points defined and documented by 
[CONTACT_258205]. Study metrics will be reported from the EDC system.  
After all data have been verified  by [CONTACT_112979], an investigator or sub-investigator 
(listed on Form FDA 1572) is required to review and approve all eCRF s prior to database lock 
and breaking of the blind.  
 
After database lock, each site will receive the eCRF  data for their site in an electronic format  for 
local archival purposes.

until [ADDRESS_1104996] 1 year of previous experience i n monitoring clinical studies. The monitor should be 
familiar with the etiology and signs and symptoms of acne and the treatment options that are 
currently available.   
Before study initiation, the investigator and site perso nnel will receive protocol training from 
the sponsor’s representatives to ensure collection of accurate, consistent, complete , and reliable 
data. This training will take place either at a web -based Investig ator Meeting or individually 
on-site. 
During the c ourse of the study, a monitor will make multiple site visits to check the progress of 
the study, review consent forms, review protocol compliance, assess drug accountability, and 
ensure that the study is being conducted according to the protocol and GCP. Any review of the 
subjects’ original medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject 
confidentiality is maintained. The investigator will ensure that the monitor or other compliance 
auditor is given access to all study -related documents  and has adequate time and space to 
conduct the monitoring visit including availability of the investigator and site personnel to 
discuss findings.  
Data capture methods will be designed to ensure accurate transfer of data to electronic media.  
The sponsor’ s Quality Assurance representative may conduct QA audits randomly or if needed 
at 5% to 10% of the investigator sites.  
 
11 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. Two -sided 
hypothesis testing  will be conducted for all inferential analyses using a significance level of 
0.05. Efficacy analyses performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be considered

primary. Efficacy analyses performed using the per -protocol (PP) population will be considered 
supportive. Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population  (all subjects  who receive 
study product  and provide any post-baseline safety information ). Study populations are defined 
in Section  11.2. 
A Statistical Analysis Plan, describing all statistical analyses, will be provided as a separate 
document prior to database lock and unblinding of the study treatments.  
 
11.1 Sample Size  
The sample siz e was estimated based on the primary study endpoints and statistics available 
from the Summary Basis of Approval for Tazorac® (tazarotene) Gel (NDA 20 -600). The total 
sample size of [ADDRESS_1104997]  90% based on a 2 -tailed alpha of 
0.05. 
Approximat ely 550 subjects (275 for each treatment arm) will be randomized  and about 25 to 35

11.2  Analysis  Data Sets  
11.2.1  Intent -to-Treat  
The ITT population will be the primary efficacy analysis data set and consists of all subjects 
who are randomized  and dispensed study medication.  
 
11.2.2  Per-Protocol  
The PP population will include all subjects in the ITT population who complete the Week  12 
evaluation without any major protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -[ADDRESS_1104998] possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise 
evaluation of treatmen t efficacy).  
Specifically, the PP population will include subjects in the ITT population who meet all of the 
following criteria:  
1. Subject met all inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
2. Subject did not take any prohibited concomitant medications during the evaluatio n 
period. The concomitant medication usage will be reviewed during the population 
determination review, remaining blinded to treatment designation, to determine 
prohibited medication usage that warrants exclusion from the PP population  if they 
met the entr ance criteria without any protocol violations . This review will take into 
consideration the timing, duration of treatment with the concomitant medication, and 
influence on the efficacy and safety assessments prior to deeming a prohibited 
concomitant medica tion as a protocol violation that warrants exclusion from PP.  
3. Completed the Week [ADDRESS_1104999] 80% but no more than 120% of the expected 
applications (168 applications expected) during the entire  evaluation  period .  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to documented lack of efficacy, 
worsening condition, or a treatment -related  AE will be included in the PP population.   
 
Other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that 
occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 
These criteria will be documented with appropriate signature [CONTACT_112991], prior to database lock.  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1105000] demographic an d baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_112980], Safety, and PP populations.  
 
11.4 Efficacy Analyses   
Efficacy summaries will be provided for both  the ITT and PP population s. 
 
11.4.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The three co-primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed as follows on the ITT population:  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-006 
Page 49 of 62 
 IGA success at Week 12 ( an IGA score of 0 (Clear)  or 1 (almost clear)  with at least a 2 -
grade reduction from baseline) – will be  analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) test for general association with treatment, stratified by [CONTACT_3725]/analysis center and 
baseline IGA.   Homogeneity of treatment effect across sites / analysis centers will be 
assessed at the 0.[ADDRESS_1105001].  
 Change in infl ammatory lesion counts on the face from baseline to Week 12 – will be 
analyzed using a two -way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with factors of 
treatment group, site/analysis center, treatment*center interaction, baseline IGA and a 
covariate of baseli ne inflammatory lesion count . 
 Change in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the face from baseline to Week 12 – will 
be analyzed using the same ANCOVA model as for the inflammatory lesion counts 
(with covariate of baseline non -inflammatory lesion count instead of inflammatory) . 
 
In the above analyses, any significant Breslow -Day or treatment*center interactions (P<0.15) 
will be examined, and if outlier centers are identified, the analysis may be repeated, excluding 
those centers.  
To claim success of the study, the analysis of all three co -primary endpoints must show DFD -03 
Lotion significantly superior to the vehicle lotion (at the 5% level, 2 -sided).  No multiplicity 
adjustments will be applied . . 
 
11.4.2  Primary Sensitivity Analysis  
 
To assess the sensitivity of the above primary method s to missing  data, analysis will also be 
conducted for the ITT population with missing values being imputed by [CONTACT_800529]:  
1) The last -observation -carried -forward (LOCF) approach : Where a co -primary endpoint (IGA, 
inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts)  has missing Week [ADDRESS_1105002] . 
2) Multiple imputation (MI) approach with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo  (MCMC) method:  
The variables to be imputed will be the three co -primary efficacy endpoints (IGA and the 
inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts) at all visits .  The MI regression model 
(used to create the imputations) will include the following factors : treatment, age, gender, 
baseline inflammatory lesion counts, baseline non -inflammatory lesion counts, and the 
results of the same variable from previous visits .  A first -stage MI with MCMC will be 
performed using SAS PROC MI (seed=[ZIP_CODE]) to produce a single imputed dataset with a  
monotone missingness pattern.  Subsequently, a second -stage MI will be performed 
(seed=[ZIP_CODE]) using the logistic regression method to produce 5 imputed datasets with all 
visit values filled in.  The primary analysis described above will then be performed on each 
of the 5 imputed datasets (for each of the 3 primary endpoints), which will produce 
estimates of treatment difference (DFD -03 minus vehicle; in the case of IGA success, it will 
be the estimate of difference in logodds and will be back -transformed t o odds ratio and 
corresponding CI at the end) and the standard error of that estimate.  Finally, the set of

11.4.3  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The secondary endpoints  are: 
 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory lesion counts on the 
face.  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on 
the face  
The s econdary endpoint s will be analyzed as follows :  
The percent change from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_1105004] analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model 
with factors of treatment group site/analysis center , and baseline IGA  and a covariate of baseline 
lesion count . 
To control for overall Type I error rate  for testing multiple secondary endpoints , statistical 
analysis for the secondary endpoints will be performed if p<0.05 has been achieved fo r all the 
co-primary endpoints, us ing a sequential  approach according to the following  order: percent 
change in inflammatory lesion counts  on the face, and  then percent change in non-inflammatory 
lesion counts  on the face . In detail, if p<0.05 is achieved for a higher ranking secondary 
variable, then success will be declared for the variable, and statistical comparisons will be 
performed for the lower ranking variable. If p<0.05 is not achieved for a higher ranking 
variable, then statistical comparisons wil l be considered descriptive (non -inferential) for this 
variable and for the lower ranking secondary variable.  
 
11.4.4  Other Efficacy Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the ITT population for the following efficacy 
endpoints  
 
1) Time to 50% reduct ion in total lesion counts on the face.  
 
2) Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
3) Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory, and total lesion 
counts on the fa ce at Weeks 4 and 8.  
4) Proportion of subjects with an IGA score of [ADDRESS_1105005] a 2 -grade reduction (for 
the face) from Baseline at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
5) Change from Baseline in Children’s DLQI total score in subjects 16  years of age or 
younger at Weeks 4 , 8, and 12. 
6) Change from Baseline in DLQI score in subjects >16 years of age at Weeks 4, 8 and 12.

11.5.3  Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) terminology. Treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) are AEs with an onset  on or after the date of the first study product  
administration. For the safety population, all reported TEAEs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490], the number and percent of subjects reporting events, system organ class  (SOC) , preferred

APPENDIX 1: DECLARAT ION OF HELSINKI (201 3) 
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_1105011] WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Bra zil, October 2013  
 
A. PREAMBLE   
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable 
human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians . The 
WMA encourages other s who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt 
these principles.  
B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my 
patient will be my first consid eration,” and the international Code o f Medical Ethics declares that “ A 
physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health , well -being and rights of patients,  
including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are 
dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.   
6. The prima ry purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
(methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventi ons must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects 
and protect their health and  rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician 
or other he alth care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given 
consent.   
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human subjects in their own countries as well as appli cable international norms and standards. No 
national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -[ADDRESS_1105012], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions 
for treating and/or c ompensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -[ADDRESS_1105013] submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and co nclusions.  
G. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of 
their personal information.  
H. INFORMED CONSENT  
25. Participation by [CONTACT_800531]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees.  
26. In medical res earch involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential 
subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipate d benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions and any other  relevant aspects of the 
study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw conse nt to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the 
specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver 
the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has un derstood the information, the 
physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject's freely -
given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -
written consent must b e formally documented and witnessed. All medical research subjects should be 
given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent sho uld be sought by [CONTACT_11274].  
28. For a potential research subject who is in capable of giving informed consent , the physician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included 
in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the 
health of the  group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with 
persons  capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation i n research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's dissent should be 
respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consen t, for example, 
unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 6.0 (Amendment 05) 
DFD -[ADDRESS_1105014] fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The 
refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must 
never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data 
contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, 
storage and/or reuse. There m ay be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or 
impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after 
consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
I. USE OF PLACEBO  
33. The benefits, risk s, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the 
best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
a. Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
b. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not 
be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of no receiving the 
best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken t o avoid abuse of this option.  
J. POST -TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make 
provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as 
beneficial  in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed 
consent process.  
K. RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly ac cessible database 
before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researchers, a uthors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the 
publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly 
available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and 
accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. 
Negative and inconclusive  as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in 
the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles o f this Declaration should 
not be accepted for publication.  
37. In the treatment of a n individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or  other known 
interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed cons ent 
from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. This 
intervention should subsequently be made the o bject of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly 
available.   October 20 13

Name [CONTACT_791] : Risperidone Implant  
Name [CONTACT_3261] : Risperidone  
Statistical Methods : 
Approximately 40 will provide ove r 90% power to establish that implant is non-inferior to the oral 4 mg 
dose of risperidone.   In the samp le size calculation it was as sumed that the true ratio was 1.1 and the 
coefficient of variance (CV) was  less than 0.45.  These assumptions were based on internal data.  
Therefore, approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled to ensure  approximately 40 subjects completing 
the study assuming that the drop rate is less than 20%.   
 
Analysis Populations: Safety population will consist of all subjects who have received any study 
medication.  
 
The pharmacokinetic ( PK) population will consist of subjects who receive 4 mg oral risperidone daily 
and the Risperidone Implant.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: All pharmacokinetic results (concentration and pharmacoki netic variables) 
will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics whe re applicable. The total active moiety 
will be considered the primary interest.  The ratios of Risperi done Implant C avg  over oral C max, over 
the oral C avg  and over the oral C trough will analyzed based on log-transformed scales using an 
ANOVA model with treatment effects.  The two sided 95% confidence intervals will be presented.   
Safety/Tolerability Analyses: The frequency of AEs will be tabu lated using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred terms and treatment 
for each cohort. The maximum intensity and frequency of AEs wil l also be summarized by [CONTACT_343873].  
Vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory evaluations, asses sment of implant site, EPS assessment 
and ECGs will be summarized by [CONTACT_10637] (visit) using descriptive statistics or 
frequency distribution, as appropriate.

of the population ( Goldner et al., 2002). Men and women are equally affected by [CONTACT_343874] t he illness in their late tee ns or early 20s; whereas, women 
usually present 10 years later in  their late 20s or early 30s ( Castle et al, 1991 ). The course of 
schizophrenia is typi[INVESTIGATOR_343848]. Th e symptoms may involve multiple 
psychological realms, such as perception (halluci nations), ideation, reality testing (delusions), 
thought processes (loose associatio ns), feeling (flatness, inap propriate affect), behavior (catatonia, 
disorganization), atte ntion, concentration, m otivation (avoliti on, impaired intention and planning), 
and judgment. These psychological and behavioral characteristic s are associated with a variety of 
impairments in occupational or s ocial functioning. Although the re can be marked deterioration 
with impairments in multiple domains of functioning (e.g., lear ning, self-care, working, 
interpersonal relationships, and living skills), the disorder is noted for great hete rogeneity across 
persons and variability within persons over time.  
Patients with schizophrenia usua lly do not return to baseline f unctioning, and there is often further 
deterioration after each relapse . Prevention of future exacerba tions is a critical goal of therapy, 
and patients who stay on continual treatment are more likely to  achieve better outcomes. Patients 
with schizophrenia generally have impaired insight and do not r ecognize that they have the 
illness. This lack of insight leads to poor or partial complian ce with their prescribed medication 
which in turn results in reduced t reatment efficacy, earlier re lapses, higher psychiatric admissions, 
reduced quality of life, increase d suicide rates, and a shortened life expectancy. An estimated 50% 
of patients do not adhere to prescr ibed medication regimens for  a variety of reasons.  The lack of 
compliance leads to increased morbidity, decreased quality of l ife, and consequently, an 
associated increase in healthcare costs. One of the patient-driven reasons for noncompliance is the 
patient’s inability to adhere to daily dosing on a long-term ba sis. Current depot formulations of 
antipsychotic only provide medi cation coverage up to one month.  A formulation such as 
Risperidone Implant, provides th erapeutic dose levels of Risper idone over 6 months and should 
further enhance patient complia nce and therefore improve patien t outcomes   
Risperidone, the active pharmaco logical ingredient (API) in the  Risperidone Implant, was first 
marketed by [CONTACT_343875]® (NDA 20-272) and 
was approved in the United Sta tes in 1993 and in Europe in 2008  to treat schizophrenia (Van Peer 
et al., 1996). The mechanism of action of r isperidone is believed to be through blockade of both 
the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor type 2 (5-HT2) and dopamine type 2 receptor (D2) (Page et al., 2010 ).  Risperidone is also marketed by [CONTACT_343876] a depot 
intramuscular injection under th e brand name [CONTACT_343909]® (NDA21-346).  Three dosage 
strengths are marketed (25  mg, 37.5 mg and 50 mg) given every 2  weeks; following this regimen, 
plasma concentrations during the  dosing interval are maintained  within the range achieved by [CONTACT_343877]. The steady state average expo sure of the 25 mg and 50 mg 
intramuscular depot injections ( Risperdal CONSTA) and the corre sponding daily administration 
of 2 mg and 4 mg oral tablets, re spectively, were comparable.

 Risperidone Implant utilizes a  novel drug delivery implant tech nology (polyurethane polymer 
technology), that had been developed by [CONTACT_343878]. in order to deliver a 
wide range of drugs and small mo lecules for an extended period of time. The Risperidone Implant 
is a subcutaneous implant composed of 300 mg USP grade risperid one, National Formulation 
(NF) grade croscarmellose sodium , NF grade stearic acid, and biomedical grade polyurethane 
(Tecoflex® EG-80A). Tecoflex E G-80A is an, aliphatic, polyether -based polyurethane membrane 
that controls the rate of risperidone release. The dimensions o f the implant are approximately 
50 mm long with an outside diameter of approximately 4 mm. Risperidone is delivered 
systemically via passive diffusi on at an anticipated release rate of 1.2 to 1.5 mg/day (based on 6-
month dog data) for a period of up to 6 months ( RISI-TR-10-007, Endo Pharmaceuticals,  2010 ). 
This release rate is expected to result in achieving similar st eady-state trough levels from a 4 
mg/day oral dose of risperidone. 
The Risperidone Implant is a re servoir-type drug delivery syste m in which risperidone pellets are 
enclosed within a sealed, cylindrical polymer membrane, made of  Tecoflex EG-80A. The polymer 
membrane controls the rate of  diffusion of the drug substance t o provide the re lease appears 
superficially to be a pseudo-zero- order however a more detailed  analysis of models development 
is presented in a separate report.  The polymer membrane is not intended to exert therapeutic 
effects although it acts to imp rove product delivery via contro lled release of t he drug substance. 
The proposed initial indication for the Risperidone Implant is “maintenance treatment of 
schizophrenia in adults”. The Ris peridone Implant may offer sig nificant advantages over 
risperidone oral tablets and long-acting depot formulations of antipsychotics (i.e., Risperdal® 
Consta®) including: 1) reduce d pain, anxiety, and risk of infec tion associated with frequent IM 
injections; 2) ability to remove the implant if treatment needs  to be discontinued urgently, which 
is not possible with the depot i njectable formulation; 3) impro ved patient compliance, which is 
expected to lead to improved functional outcomes and reduced re lapse rates and EPS; 4) 
improved convenience for patients  and healthcare providers due to less frequent clinic visits; and 
5) reduced healthcare costs because of improved functional outc omes, reduced relapse rates, 
reduced clinic visits for drug dosing, and reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]. 
For adults with schizophrenia,  the effective dose range of oral  risperidone tablets is 4 to 
16 mg/day with a target dose of 4 to 6 mg/day.

1.1.1 Summary of Nonclinical Findings and Safety  
The endocrine, central nervous system (CNS), and cardiovascular  effects of risperidone have 
been characterized as part of the original Risperdal® New Drug Application (NDA 20-272) 
(Risperdal NDA 20-272, 1993 ). The safety and efficacy of risperidone have also been 
demonstrated in acute, sub chronic and chronic toxicity, reprod uctive and developmental 
toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies in support of the original Risperdal NDA 20-
272 ( Risperdal NDA 20-272, 1993 ). Findings in these studies  were consistent with the 
proposed mechanism of action, i.e., antagonism of 5-HT2 and dopamine receptor type 2 (D2) of 
risperidone. 
Comprehensive biocompatibility t esting of Tecoflex EG-80A impla nt was performed in 
12-Feb-[ADDRESS_426737] implantable 
biomaterial. Testing included acute toxicity, genotoxicity, loc al tolerance, cytotoxicity, 
implantation, and pyrogenicity. Extracts of blank Tecoflex EG-8 0A were not systemically toxic, 
mutagenic, cytotoxic, or pyrogenic, and did not elicit a dermal  sensitization response. Extracts of 
blank Tecoflex EG-80A were not irritating when injected intrade rmally in rabbits and 
subcutaneous (SC) implantation of empty Tecoflex EG-80A implants for up to 6 months in dogs, 
4 weeks and 6 months in rats , or  36 weeks in rabbits were very  well tolerated systemically, and 
did not elicit an adverse local reaction. 
The safety of risperidone and empty (blank) Tecoflex EG-80A imp lant was demonstrated in the 
3- and 6-month toxicity studies in Beagle dogs. There was no sy stemic toxicity observed with 
empty (blank) Tecoflex EG-80A implants in both studies.  In bot h studies, findings related to the 
perturbations of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-reproductive axis, consistent with the previously reported effects 
of risperidone, have been observed with Risperidone Implants. I n the 3-month dog toxicity 
study, chronic inflammation (mild to severe) was noted microsco pi[INVESTIGATOR_343849] 1 of 8 blank Tecoflex EG-80A animals and two (2) of [ADDRESS_426738] been evaluated (Snoeck et al., 
1995). The elimination rate and clearance of 9-OH-risperidone was r educed in the elderly and 
patients with renal di 
sease because of a diminished creatinine clearance, while the PK of 
risperidone in the elderly and cirrhotic patients were comparable to those in young patients. The 
total clearance of oral risperidone was reduced in patients wit h renal disease. Based on the 
pharmacokinetics of the active moiety, a dose reduction and a c autious dose titration in the

 elderly and in patients with  renal disease is recommended (Snoeck et al., 1995) . In patients with 
cirrhosis of the liver, the single-dose pharmacokinetics were c omparable to those in healthy 
young subject s, thus no dose adjustment is required. 
1.1.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism in Humans  
The PK and metabolism of the active ingredient risperidone, has  been extensively studied in 
human subjects, patients with schizophrenia, and patients with bipolar disorders. In addition, 
the PK of risperidone has been evaluated in subjects with impai red hepatic and renal function 
(Snoeck et al., 1995 ).  
Risperidone metabolism in humans, as well as in rats and dogs, results in the formation of an 
active metabolite, 9-OH-risperidone. In humans, this metabolite  has a different PK profile 
(longer half-life: 20 hours versus 3 hours compared with risper idone), but has in vitro 
pharmacological and potency profiles comparable to that of risp eridone (Mannens et al., 1993 ). 
For this reason, the sum concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH -risperidone are generally 
considered the “active drug moiety.” 
The hydroxylation of risperidone to the 9-OH metabolite is cata lyzed mainly by [CONTACT_9058] P-
450 system (CYP) 2D6, a polymorphically expressed CYP in humans . The ratios of risperidone 
to 9-OH-risperidone in plasma and urine differ in humans phenot yped as extensive metabolizers 
(EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs) o f debrisoquine or dextrometho rphan ( Mannens et al., 1993; 
Huang et al., 1993 ). 
Following an oral dose of 14C-risperidone to healthy subjects,  Mannens et al., 1993 found that in 
the urine of EM subjects, only 3.5%  of the dose was the parent compound, while 30% of the 
dose was recovered in the  urine of PM subjects ( Mannens et al., 1993). Although the primary 
elimination pathway of risperidone is through metabolism, the a ctive metabolite 9-OH-
risperidone is primarily eliminated by [CONTACT_13624]. In urin e, 9-OH-risperidone represented 
32% of the dose in the  EM, but only 8% in the  PM. Other metabolites, of far less importance, 
were detected in urine. Only 3% to 5% of the dose could be iden tified as glucuronide conjugates 
in urine, indicating that glucuronidation is a minor metabolic pathway ( Mannens et al., 1993 ).  
After intravenous dosing, risperidone plasma concentrations fel l in a biphasic manner with a 
distribution half-life of 6 minutes followed by a terminal half -life of 3 hours in EM and 17 to 
22 hours in PM. The apparent volum e of distribution of risperid one (1.1 L/kg) was independent 
of the metabolic phenotype. Ren al clearance of risperidone repr esented 3% of the total 
clearance in the EMs (394 mL/min ), and about 20% of the total c learance in the PMs (54 
mL/min) ( Huang et al., 1993 ). Although the clearance of r isperidone differed by 7-fold 
between EMs and PMs, the plasma A UC and also the clearance of t he active moiety differed 
only by 20% between PMs and EMs because the EMs extensively for m the active metabolite 
(Van Peer et al., 1996). The terminal half-life of the active moiety averaged 20 hours ( Huang 
et al., 1993 ). 
The effects of age, moderate and severe renal impairment, and l iver disease on the 
pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone have been evaluated (Snoeck et al., 
1995). The elimination rate and clearance of 9-OH-risperidone was r educed in the elderly and 
patients with renal disease because of a diminished creatinine clearance, while the PK of 
risperidone in the elderly and cirrhotic patients were comparable to those in young patients. The

 total oral clearance of risperidone was reduced in patients wit h renal disease. Based on the 
pharmacokinetics of the active moiety, a dose reduction and a c autious dose titration in the 
elderly and in patients with  renal disease is recommended (Snoeck et al., 1995). In cirrhotic 
patients, the single-dose pharmacokinetics was comparable to th ose in healthy young subjects, 
thus not requiring dose adjustment. 
1.[ADDRESS_426739] in human Phase 1 study (EN3342-
101) in 6 subjects diagnosed with s chizophrenia whose disease w as maintained with a daily 4 mg 
oral dose of risperidone.  In thi s study there were no serious adverse events (SAEs), or 
discontinuations due to an AE occurred. Adverse events were rep orted in five (5) of the 6 enrolled 
subjects. There was 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) o f erectile dysfunction. The AE 
reported included incisional si te pain, paresthesia, and hypoes thesia in the arm of the 
implantation, constipation, arthr algia, join swelling, worsenin g of extrapyramidal disorder, 
worsening of schizophrenia, and suicidal ideation.  The PK data  indicated that th e active moiety 
Cave from the risperidone Implant  over a 3-month period averaged approximately 77% of the 
subjects’ oral risperidone C trough level.  The implants used in R isperidone Implant-101 contained 
375 mg risperidone. 
The second study was another Ph ase 1 study with a 6-month in du ration in 35 subjects (EN3342-
102) study, including 5 subjects w ho only received oral risperidone and discontinued prior to 
receiving EN3342 implants, and there were 10 subjects each in t he 480 mg, 720 mg, and 960 mg 
Risperidone Implant doses/tre atment groups. The most common TEA E overall was injection site 
pain (40.0%), which occurred in [ADDRESS_426740] (10.0%) in the EN3342  480 mg group, 7 subjects 
(70.0%) in the 720 mg group and 4 subjects (40.0%) in the 960 m g group. Injection site 
hemorrhage, incision site edema, anxiety and psychotic disorder  were also relatively common 
(occurring in 13.3%) of subjects  overall. Implant site pain, difficult device use and weight 
increased were reported in 10.0%  of subjects overall, while oth er TEAEs were each reported in 
only 1 or 2 subjects, overall. There  was no discernible difference in patterns of TEAEs between 
the 3 treatment groups, other tha n possibly a higher incidence of implantation-type events in the 
720 mg group, and a higher inciden ce of psychotic disorder in the 960 mg group (30.0% of 
subjects vs. 10% in the 720 mg group and 0% in the 480 mg group). Comparison of oral 
risperidone and the Risperidone Imp lants demonstrate that while  Cmax and C avg were higher in oral 
risperidone, C trough for oral risperidone was more comparable to C ss for EN3342 implants at 
respective dose levels.

1.3 PK Model Summary  
 
All PK data (risperi done, 9-OH-risperidone , and total active dr ug) from study EN3342-102 could 
be modeled.  Total active drug conc entration (risperidone + 9OH -risperidone) is the best 
representation of compound activ ity. EN3342 PK data show an imm ediate release of risperidone 
once implanted consistent with a s ingle day’s dose, then consta nt (the release appears superficially 
to be a pseudo-zero-order however a more detailed analysis of m odels development is presented in a 
separate report ) delivery of risperidone over a 180-day period. PK modeling co mparisons of 
EN3342 three 300 mg Risperidone Impla nts  (900 mg risperidone)  to daily oral risperidone 4 mg 
dosing suggests EN3342 mainta ins concentrations above C trough and below C max, and comparable 
to C avg over 180 days and which is being tested in this clinical study .

• Entered the study in viola tion of this protocol 
• Safety and/or Efficacy reasons as judged by [CONTACT_117128] d/or Sponsor (see 
section 10.3 and/or section 9) 
• Non-compliance to the protocol as  judged by [CONTACT_117128] d/or Sponsor 
• Required the use of a prohibited concomitant medication (see se ction 5.2) 
• Withdrawal of informed consent; any subject who withdraws conse nt as a result of an 
AE, regardless of severity or I nvestigator’s opi [INVESTIGATOR_1649], must be r eported as a discontinuation 
due to an AE 
• In the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue 
• Sponsor decision 
The date a subject discontinues, the treatment, and the reason for discontinuation will be 
recorded in the case report form (CRF). If a subject discontinues from the study, all end-of-study 
procedures should be conducted. If, however, a subject withdraw s consent, no end-of-study 
procedures are required except the collection of AE information  and removal of the implant. This 
information should be recorded i n the CRF. The decision whether  to enroll replacement subjects 
will be made by [CONTACT_343885] . 
When a subject is “lost to follo w-up” (i.e., fails to return fo r study visits), a reasonable effort will 
be made to contact [CONTACT_12552]/her to determine a reason for the failur e to return and encourage the 
subject to return for removal of the implant. The detailed plan  that the research center will follow 
in attempts to contact a subject t hat fails to return for a vis it is listed below.

7.1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
7.1.1 Blood Sample Collections 
Pharmacokinetic assessments for risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone a nd active moiety (risperidone 
plus 9-OH-risperidone) will be pe rformed for all subjects in th e study. Samples of venous blood 
will be obtained according to the clinical research facility st andard procedure and collected at the 
times indicated in the Sche dule of Study Evaluations (Table 3 -7). PK samples should be drawn 
from the arm contralateral to the implant. Samples collected wi thin 10% of the specified times 
will not be considered protocol de viations; however, every attempt will be made by [CONTACT_343888]. The exact sample collection times will 
be recorded in the CRF t o the nearest minute. 
All plasma samples will be placed into a freezer at -20°C or be low within 1 hour after collection 
and further plasma sample handling instructions will be provide d and detailed by [CONTACT_11378].   
 
7.1.2 Sample Storage and Shipment  
All plasma samples will be store d frozen (at -20°C or below) un til they are shipped to the 
analytical facility. Prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the samples will be packed into thermal insulated containers 
and packed in sufficient dry ice to assure they remain frozen, and are protected from breakage

 8 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
8.1 Psychiatric Rating Scales 
All assessments will be completed as indicated in the Schedule of Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -
7) by [CONTACT_343890]. The n umber of clinicians who make these 
assessments should be k ept to a minimum. It is most desirable t o have only one person making 
all the assessments for a given day. 
 
8.1.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)  
The PANSS is a rating scale used to assess the positive symptom s, negative symptoms, and 
general psychopathology specifi cally associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 
30 items. Each item is rated on a  scale from 1 (symptom not pre sent) to 7 (symptom extremely 
severe). The sum of the [ADDRESS_426774] presenting with signs  and symptoms of lack-of-effic acy (LOE) will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_737], or designee. L OE will be evaluated using PANSS.  The subject will be 
withdrawn from the study and will be scheduled for implant remo val as soon as possible if LOE 
is determined. Once the implant has been removed, the subject w ill be restarted on his/her pre-
implant oral Risperidone dosing regimen. The Investigator will notify the Medical Monitor and 
Sponsor of each case of LOE.

 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
10.1 Timing of Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will be obtained throughout the study. The t iming of these measurements is 
detailed in the Schedul e of Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -7). PK samples will be drawn before the 4 
mg oral risperidone dose during days -7 to -1 then at 0.5, 1, 2 , 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24 hours on 
Day -1 prior to implantation of R isperidone Implant for the pat ients that will be implanted with 
600 mg (2, 300 mg) and 900 mg (3, 300 mg).  The initial four “N on-PK run in” subjects in the 
three [ADDRESS_426775] PK draws done until th e pre-implant draw on Day 1 
(this group is no longer enrolling). 
On implant day, PK samples will be drawn pre-implantation, [ADDRESS_426776] implant, then 
daily from day 2 to day 7.  The follo wing “priority order” will  be in effect when more than 1 
assessment is required at a particular time point: 
• PK blood sampling will take prior ity over all study procedures unless there is a LOE. 
The exact time of collection to  nearest minute will be document ed in the CRF. 
• Safety parameters will be mon itored throughout the study by [CONTACT_283984], 
clinical laboratory evaluations , ECGs, physical examinations, i mplant site assessments, 
extrapyramidal symptom assessments, (EPS), Columbia Suicide Sev erity Scale 
assessments (C-SSRS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS ), Simpson 
Rating Scale (SAS), and Barnes Ak athisia Scale (BARS) and adver se event (AE) 
monitoring will be performed at a similar time per day.  The ex act time of assessments 
to nearest minute will be  documented in the CRF. 
10.2 Safety Parameters  
10.2.1 Medical/Medication History and Demographic Information  
A detailed relevant medical hi story and medication history will be recorded for each subject at 
screening and reviewed/updated upo n admission to the clinical r esearch facility to confirm 
eligibility for the study. Signi ficant medical conditions or co nditions that are ongoing (e.g., 
headache, indigestion, diabetes, hypertension) will be recorded in the CRF. The medication 
history must identify any known drug allergies, present or hist ory of drug abuse and use of acute 
or chronic medications. 
Demographic information (i.e ., age, sex, and race) will be collected for all subjects and recorded 
on the appropriate CRF. 
10.2.2 Physical Examinations 
The complete physical examination assessment will be completed at the time points indicated in 
the Schedule of Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -7) and will include an assessment of the following: 
general appearance, skin, head and neck (including eyes, ears, nose, and throat), lymph nodes, 
thyroid, musculoskeletal/extremities (including spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), cardiov ascular, lungs, abdomen and 
neurological systems. The screening physical examination will also include a measurement of 
body height and weight (without shoes) for determination of the subject’s BMI. 
12-Feb-[ADDRESS_426777] 8 hours pr ior to all la boratory evaluations. A complete 
series of laboratory evaluations (i.e., clinical chemistry, hem atology, and urinalysis), substances

It is the Investigator’s responsibility to understand and comply with all laws and regulations that 
apply to the testing of blood for HIV and hepatitis B and C. These laws and regulations may 
include state laws related to written consent, separate from th e ICF for this study, and pre- and 
post-test counseling.  
Any clinically significant abnormalities should be fully investigated and reported as AEs. 
Whenever possible, the etiology of the abnormal findings will b e documented in the CRF. 
Laboratory results with clinically significantly abnormal value s should be repeated for 
confirmation. Additional tests and other evaluations required t o establish the clinical 
significance or etiology of an abnormal laboratory result or to monitor the course of an AE 
should be obtained when clinically indicated. In particular, if a clinically significant abnormal 
result is observed that is not resolved by [CONTACT_53601], repeat tests should be performed to document resolution or stability of the abnormality. 
The diagnosis associated with any clinically significant laboratory abnormality will be recorded 
as an AE on the CRF. Recorded A Es should indicate the underlyin g abnormality or diagnosis 
(e.g., renal insufficiency) as opposed to the observed deviatio n in laboratory results (e.g., 
elevated creatinine). 
Any significant laboratory abnormalities that are either seriou s or unexpected should be 
promptly reported to the Medical Monitor. Any additional releva nt laboratory results obtained 
by [CONTACT_343891] c ourse of this study will be sup plied to the Sponsor. 
 
10.2.4 Vital Signs  
Routine vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, resp iration rate, and oral body 
temperature will be obtained at t he times indicated in the Sche dule of Study Evaluations 
(Table 3 -7).  Blood pressure assessments  should be conducte d in the arm  contralateral to the 
implant. 
Blood pressure, heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_343857] d after the subject is in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_12473] [ADDRESS_426779] 12-lead ECG will be obtained at the times indicated in the Schedule of Study

 10.2.6 Implant Site Assessments 
 
Implant site assessments will include monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection, (e.g., 
pain, tenderness, swelling, erythema, exudate) and tolerability . The presence of the implant will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_343893] ( Table 3 -7). Clinically significant findings, as judged by [CONTACT_3786], resulting from t he implant site assessment will b e recorded as AEs. If an infection 
develops at the implant site, th e subject will be withdrawn fro m the study and the implant will 
be removed. The infection will be  treated in accordance with st andard medical practice. Once 
the implant has been removed the subject will be restarted on h is/her pre-implant oral

Investigator to confirm implant location.  
The Investigator will inform the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor of a ny clinically significant findings 
related to implant assessments. 
 
10.2.7 Extrapyramidal Symptom Assessments  
Safety testing to monitor for si gns of EPS will assessed at the  times indicated in the Schedule of 
Study Evaluations ( Table 3 -7).  The assessments will be conducted with the use of the fol lowing 
objective rating scales: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson Rating Scale 
(SAS), and Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS). 
Assessments will be completed by [CONTACT_343894]. The number 
of clinicians who make these asse ssments should be kept to a mi nimum. It is most desirable to 
have only one person mak ing all the assessme nts for a given day .

• During the outpatient phase of the study all subjects will be i nstructed to call the site if 
they have a sudden change in feeli ngs of wellness that may be r elated to possible 
exaggerated pharmacologic effects. If a severe or serious adver se event (SAE) is 
reported within [ADDRESS_426782] the implant removed. 
At the time of explantation, it is expected that the implant will be removed as a single pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. If 
any breakage occurs, attempts w ill be made to remove the remain ing pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959](s). If the remaining 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959](s) is not found, the patient will be observed closely for  clinical symptoms and plasma drug 
levels will be monitored for highe r than expected levels, and t reatment will be provided per 
standard medical practice. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_426783]’s medical history. The 
Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of A Es to the study medication; 
relationship will be classified as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or probably related 
(see section [IP_ADDRESS] for definitions). 
All AEs will be collected by [CONTACT_343895]. This includes any AEs that are ongoing at the completion/termination of the study, and any AEs that start aft er the last dose of study medi cation. A follow-up safety visit will 
be conducted approxima tely [ADDRESS_426784] be reported within 7 or 15 days 
to the FDA. If so, the  Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s representative ) will report the event to the 
FDA. The Investigator will transm it a written report of the cir cumstances and outcome to the 
Sponsor as soon as he or she is m ade aware of the circumstances . The Investigator will report 
SAEs to the Institutional Review  Board (IRB) per IRB policy. 
10.4.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
An AE is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure  (signs), body function 
(symptoms), laboratory result (e.g., chemistry, ECG, etc.), or worsening of a pre-existing 
condition associated temporally w ith the use of the study medic ation whether or not considered 
related to the s tudy medication. 
A treatment-emergent AE is any condition that was not present p rior to treatment with study 
medication but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment initiation but worsened 
during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but re solved and then reappeared while 
the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of  the AE when the treatment was 
initiated). 
 
All AEs, including either obser ved or volunteered problems, com plaints, signs, or symptoms 
must be recorded on the AE page o f the CRF, regardless of wheth er associated with the use of 
study medication. This would incl ude AEs resulting from concurr ent illness, reactions to 
concurrent medication use, or p rogression of disease states (ex cluding the disease under study).  
AEs should be recorded in standard medical terminology. 
The Investigator will evaluate each AE for duration, intensity,  and relationship to study 
medication, record the action ta ken, and any treatment given. R ecurrent symptoms of a chronic 
pre-existing condition are not considered AEs unless they occur  in a worse or unexpected pattern 
during study drug administration. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Intensity of AEs 
The intensity (or severity) of A Es is characterized as mild, mo derate, or severe: 
Mild AEs are usually transient, requi ring no special treatment, and do not interfere with the 
subject’s daily activities. 
Moderate AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the su bject and may 
interfere with daily activities,  but are usually ameliorated by  [CONTACT_14212]. 
Severe AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and typi[INVESTIGATOR_343858]. When the intensity category of t he AE changes more frequently t han once daily, the maximum 
intensity for the event is record ed. If the intensity category changes after a number of days, then 
these sub-events or changes are recorded separately (i.e., havi ng distinct onset a nd stop dates).

 [IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Medication 
The degree of “relatedness” of th e AE to the study drug may be described using the following 
scale: 
Not related indicates that the AE is definitely not related  to the study drug. 
Unlikely related indicates that there are other , more likely causes and study dr ug is not 
suspected as a cause. Possibly related indicates that a direct cause a nd effect relationship between s tudy drug and the 
AE has not been demonstrated but  there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by 
[CONTACT_5257]. Probably related indicates that there probably is  a direct cause and effect rela tionship between 
the AE and the study drug. 
It is the Sponsor’s policy to c onsider “Probable” and “Possible” causality assessments as positive 
causality. It is the Sponsor’s po licy to consider “Not” and “Un likely” causality assessments as 
negative causality. Assessments are to be recorded  on the CRF and must indicate cle arly the relationship being 
assessed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as an AE that: 
• Results in death 
• Is immediately life-threatening (t here is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include a n AE that had it occurred in a  more serious form 
may have caused death) 
• Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (Note: a ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_343859]-planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not consti tute an SAE unless there 
is complication resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343860]). An AE that results in a visit to 
an Emergency Room that does not require an inpatient stay is no t always classified as an 
SAE. 
• Results in permanent or substantia l disability (permanent or su bstantial disruption 
of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a patient  using the study 
medication regardless of time to diagnosis) 
• Is considered an important medical event 
Life-threatening events are defi ned as events that place the subject, in the  view of the 
Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as i t occurred, i.e., it does not include 
a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might h ave caused death. 
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s  ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
12-Feb-[ADDRESS_426785] or their partner will be reported to the Sponsor using the same 
reporting timelines as indi cated for SAEs in section [IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy itself is not regarded as 
an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_343861] a contraceptive medication . However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (i.e., spontaneous miscarriage, elective abortion, normal birth or congenital 
abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the sub ject was discontinued from 
the study. 
All reports of congenital abnorma lities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions withou t complications should not be 
handled as AEs unless the deci sion to abort was based on a diag nostic test that indicated there 
was a problem. All outcomes of p regnancy must be reported to th e Sponsor on the pregnancy 
outcomes report form. 
10.[ADDRESS_426786] common adverse 
reactions (≥10%) in clinical st udies with risperidone oral tabl ets include somnolence, increased 
appetite, fatigue, rhinitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092],  vomiting, coughing, urinary 
incontinence, saliva increased, constipation, fever, Parkinsoni sm, dystonia, abdominal pain, 
anxiety, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, tremor, rash, akathisia,  and dyspepsia. Subjects will be 
monitored closely th roughout the study for potential adverse ev ents. 
There are no additional risks e xpected with implantation of the  Risperidone Implants beyond 
those normally encountered during similar minor surgical proced ures. A Sponsor-trained, 
licensed physician, must insert and remove the Risperidone Impl ants Aseptic t echnique should 
be followed at all times during the implant procedure to minimi ze the chance of infection. 
Sterile gloves are required at all times throughout the implantation and explantation procedure. 
The implantation/explantation procedure may result in bruising,  pain/soreness/tenderness, skin 
redness, and swelling at the site of implantation. Subjects wil l be monitored closely throughout 
the study for signs and symptoms of  implantation site reactions .   
The Investigator should treat a ll adverse experiences in accord ance with standard medical 
practice. Due to the investigational nature of the method of de livery of Risperidone, the AE 
profile cannot be defined with certainty; all subjects will be carefully evaluated. 
Additional information regarding AEs is provided in the Investi gator Brochure and the MOP. 
12-Feb-[ADDRESS_426787] atistical methods to be used. Thes e methods may be revised and 
updated due to reasons such as regu latory requirements or need for further clarific ations. The final 
analysis plan will be documented in a formal statistical analys is plan (SAP) that must be finalized 
before database lock. The SAP will include details on how varia bles will be derived, how missing 
data will be handled, and how data will be presented as well as the details on statistical methods to 
be used for safety and efficacy analyses. The final clinical st udy report will discuss deviations 
from the SAP, if any.  For bridging the efficacy of the  Risperidone Implant to oral ri speridone, the mean concentrations 
after the insertion of the Impla nts is expected to approximate the mean C
avg of oral 4 mg 
risperidone and not to exceed oral C max. In addition, the average concentr ations after the implant 
is expected to be higher than the oral C trough.  The target concentration is to provide consistent 
levels between the relevant oral C trough and C max, where efficacy and safet y could be preserved.  
 
 
11.1 Sample Size Consideration  
Approximately 40 will provide over 90% power to establish that implant is non-inferior to the 
oral dose of risperidone. .   In the sample size calculation it was assumed that the true ratio was at least 1.1 and the coefficient of variance (CV) was less than 0.45.  These assumptions were based on internal data.  Therefore, approximately 50 subjects w ill be enrolled to ensure 
approximately 40 subjects completing the study assuming that th e drop rate is less than 20%. 
11.[ADDRESS_426788] eristics will be summarized usi ng appropriate descriptive 
statistics. 
11.5 Concomitant Medications  
Medications administered prior to and concomitantly with study treatment will be tabulated and

11.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
11.6.1 Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Pharmacokinetic variables of AUC 0-24 (oral dose only) , AUC 3-180 days, (Risperidone Implant 
only), AUC 3-t, (Risperidone Implant only), C max, Ctrough and T max (oral dose only), for 
risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone will be derived. The active moiet y will be calculated as the sum 
of the risperidone a nd 9-OH-risperidone con centrations at each sampling time point.  In 
order to minimize the contribution that the Day [ADDRESS_426789] on the 
AUC during implantation, the AUC calculation for the implantation period will initiate 3 days 
after implantation (Day 3).  The  concentrations of risperidone,  9-OH risperidone and active 
moiety on Days 1 to 3 will be summa rized to characterize the ph armacokinetics of risperidone 
and 9-OH-risperidone when changing the oral tablet to implant.  The C avg values for 
risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone and active moiety from the Risper idone Implants will be 
calculated as the plasma AUC 3-t divided by t-3 (in days). The C avg for the oral tablet will be 
calculated as the plasma AUC 0-24 on Day -1 divided by 24 hours.  Actual sample times (relative 
to the corresponding implantati on time) rounded to two decimal digits and negative pre-dose 
times set to zero, will be used i n the computation of the pharm acokinetic variables, rather than 
scheduled times. Refer to section 11.7 for the handling of missing values. 
The definition and method of determination for each pharmacokin etic variable are summarized 
in Table 9 .

11.6.2 Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data 
All PK data (concentration and pharmacokinetic variables) will be summarized usi ng appropriate 
descriptive statistics. The ratios of Risperidone Implant C avg  over oral C max, over oral C avg  and over oral 
Ctrough will be analyzed based on log-tr ansformed scales using an ANOV A model with treatment effects.  
The two sided 95% confidence inte rvals will be presented.  Infe riority is defined as the lower bound of 
95% confidence interval o f the ratio is <0.8. 
 
The active moiety will be considered the primary interest.  To control for Type I error rate, active moiety will be analyzed first, followed by [CONTACT_343896] e. 
The concentrations of risperi done, 9-OH risperidone and active moiety on Days 1 to 3 will be 
summarized to characterize the pharmacokinetics of risperidone when changing the oral tablet 
to implant. 
The study is designed to evaluat e the PK profiles of the 900 mg implant arm.  PK profile for 600 
mg arm is exploratory. 
11.7 Handling of Missing Values  
Plasma concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ) w ill be set to half of BLQ value 
in the computation of mean concentration values; however, BLQ c oncentrations between [ADDRESS_426790] measurable concentration will  be set to half of the BLQ value; 
other BLQ concentrations will be set to missing. 
No imputation will be performed for demographic and safety data . 
11.8 Safety Analysis 
The safety analysis will be based on all subjects who received any study medication. The 
frequency of AEs will be tabulat ed using the Me dical Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) by [CONTACT_9313] (S OC) and preferred term (PT), a nd treatment for each cohort. 
The maximum intensity  and frequency of AEs will be summarized b y treatment and cohort.

12.1 Study Monitoring 
The monitoring of the study will  be performed in accordance wit h the principles of Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) as descr ibed in the International Confe rence on Harmonization (ICH) E6 
titled “Good Clinical Practice.” Monitoring including source da ta verification s hould be routinely 
performed prior to the transfe r of data to Data Management. 
It is a prerequisite of this st udy that the study monitor has d irect access to source data for data 
verification. This will be done by [CONTACT_343897]’s 
medical notes (permission fro m the subject will be sought as part of the consent process). Such 
verification is an essential el ement of quality control, as it allows the rectification of transcription 
errors and omissions. 
The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the study c oordinator and Investigator will be 
available, the source documentation will be a vailable, and a su itable environment will be 
provided for review of study related documents. 
12.2 Audits and Inspections

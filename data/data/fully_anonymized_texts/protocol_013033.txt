01 Aug 2018  10 STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Analysis Populations  
All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed u sing the Full Analysis Set (FAS). 
The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) will be used only for the analysis of the selected  endpoint s 
to examine the robustness of the primary analysis.  
Safety and tolerability will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set.  
Safety Analysis Set : The Safety Analysis Set comprises all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
study drug. 
Full Analysis Set : The FAS comprises the  subset of the Safety Analysis Set who have a baseline 
and post-baseline  efficacy  evaluation .  
Per Protocol Analysis Set : The PPAS comprises the subset of subject s from the FAS who are 
treated according to the protocol without any major dev iations. A full list of inclusion criteria will 
be decided and assessed prior to database lock and unblinding.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set : The PK Analysis Set comprises the subset of the Safety Analysis 
Set who provide evaluable  PK assessments.  
Efficacy Analysis  
Primary Efficacy Analysis : The [ADDRESS_1152901] -squares mean contrasts using a 2 -tailed 95% confidence interval  (CI). 
For subject s in the efficacy analysis populations with missing primary efficacy endpoints,  multiple 
imputation by [CONTACT_830578]. The imputation model will use 
subject  demographics (age, sex,  race, baseline weight,  and smoking status ) and baseline and 
post-baseline mean number and severity of vasomotor symptoms. Sensitivity analyses will be 
performed with other multiple imputation methods and mixed model for repeat measurement s.  
Since the study design requires the comparison of  7 active dose group s with placebo for 
4 co-primary efficacy variables, a two -tier closed testing procedure will be used to control the 
family -wise error. A step -down tes ting procedure will be followed . The following testing order of 
doses wil l be employed:  
a. Placebo versus  90 mg BID (daily dose 180 mg) , 
b. Placebo versus  60 mg BID (daily dose 120  mg), 
c. Placebo versus  120 mg QD (daily dose 120  mg), 
d. Placebo versus  30 mg BID (daily dose 60  mg), 
e. Placebo versus  60 mg QD (daily dose 60  mg), 
f. Placebo versus  15 mg BID (daily dose 30  mg), and  
g. Placebo versus  30 mg QD (daily dose 30  mg).

[ADDRESS_1152902] of premat ure 
dropouts and/or major protocol deviations.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis : Efficacy will be further assessed based on the secondary endpoints 
described  above using  the FAS. 
Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_830579], physical examination  
findings , C-SSRS, vital signs, ECGs,  clinical laboratory tests , and bone density marker 
concentrations  over time using the Safety Analysis Set.  
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
A total of 352 subje cts are planned to be randomized, 44  subjects  in each treatment arm . This is 
based  on the observed data for severity and frequency of moderate and severe vasomotor 
symptoms  from the Phase 2a study . Sample size calculations from statistical analysis software 
were based on 2 -sample t -tests, assuming 2 -sided 5%  alpha and power of >90% for expected effect 
sizes.

01 Aug 2018  21 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACK GROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Background  Information  
1.1.1 Vasomotor Symptoms  (Hot F lashes)  
Vasomotor symptoms  (hot flashes) are the most common complaint amo ng women entering 
menopause and , for many women , may continue to occur for up to 5 years (although about 20%  of 
women may have them for up to 15 years) .1–3 Approximately 75% of peri -menopausal women will 
experience vasomotor symptoms  (hot flashes) , with 10% to 20% of those enduring severe 
symptoms .4 Today, more than 25 million women in the [LOCATION_002] alone experience symptoms 
of vasomotor symptoms  (hot flashes) , and 4  million women report severe symptoms .5  
Vasomotor symptoms  (hot flashes)  can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life  
and are therefore  a major reason for menopausal women to seek medical attention. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_830560] , the physiology of vasomotor symptoms  (hot flashes)  is not 
fully understood ; although , a disturbance in normal thermoregulatory function is thought to be the 
main underlying cause.  
The primary symptom of vasomotor symptoms  (hot flashes)  is a subjective and transient sensation 
of heat , flushing, a nd sweating  that usually lasts [ADDRESS_1152913] effective  and commonly used pharmacological  treatment for vasomotor symptoms  (hot 
flashes)  is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but a Women’s Health Initiative study raised 
questions about the long -term safety of this treatment. Current guidelines recommend a limited 
duration of HRT due to associated risks of breast cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke , and 
thromboembolism .1,6 Furthermore, the current safety data do not support the use of HRT in many 
patients (e g, patients with breast/endometrial cancer or  liver disease).  
The perceived limitations of HRT  coupled with the lack of efficacy and the adverse effects 
observed with non -hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] h ave led clinicians to search for other treatment options for 
vasomotor symptoms . Recent studies of venlafaxine and fluoxetine in women with a prior history 
of breast cancer have suggested that certain antidepressants with the ability to inhibit serotonin 
reuptake may significantly reduce vasomotor symptoms of me nopause .7–9 However, t he clinical 
benefit of these antidepressants is not as great as that observed for estrogen . 
1.1.2 Introduction to ESN364  (International Nonproprietary Name : [CONTACT_830611])  
ESN364 is an orally -available , potent , and selective small molecule  neurokinin 3 receptor  (NK3R ) 
antagonist shown to s ignificantly modulate the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -gonadal (HPG) axis to 
lower the circulating levels of sex hormones in nonclinical  studies and in clinical trials. The 
mechanism -of-action of ESN364 is to decr ease the luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency, a 
response indicative of a decrease in the  gonadotropin -releasing hormone  (GnRH ) pulse 
frequency .10 Moreover, the finding that the drug action selectivel y affected LH  but not 
follicle -stimulating hor mone (FSH) provides additional evidence that ESN364 does not block 
GnRH signaling but merely decreases the GnRH pulse frequency. The selective effect of ESN364 
to lower L H but not FSH is consistent in rat s, sheep, monkey s, and male and female humans .10,11 
Ogeda S.A.  
Clinical Study Protocol ESN364_HF_205

Protocol Version 4.0 (incl. Amendments)  
[ADDRESS_1152914] demonstrated that the GnRH pulse frequency is modulated by 
[CONTACT_830580]/neurokinin B  (NKB) /dynorphin ( KNDy ) neurons (also known  as “KiSS Neuron” ) 
in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus .[ADDRESS_1152915] shown that these 
neurons are sensitive to NKB /NK3R signal .13 These data support  the hypothesis that ESN364 
antagonism of NK3R on the KNDy neuron decreases the GnRH pulse frequency as the basis of 
the downstream e ffects observed on LH, FSH , and the sex hormones. The schematic  of the  
neurokinin 3 (N K3) modulatory role on GnRH neurons to inhibit GnRH release and consequent 
release of sex hormones is presented in  Figure 1.

Furthermore, the proposed pharmacological action of ESN364 is consistent with the findings of a 
landmark publication revealing that a human population identified to have a l oss-of-function 
mutation in NK3R presents a phenotype of reduced circulating levels of sex hormones, but with 
the important distinction that the levels of these hormones are above castration levels in women .[ADDRESS_1152916], patients expressing a GnRH  receptor loss -of-function mutation exhibit castration levels 
of both LH and FSH .16 Luteinizing hormone and FSH function independently to stimulate estradiol 
(E2) release from the ovaries. In total, these human mutant studies predict th at ESN364 antagonism 
of NK3R  will diminish levels of E2 due to redu ction of the LH pulse frequency  but will not affect 
FSH levels. T herefore , there is a natural safety margin in place that protects against over -inhibition 
of E2 and the attenuation side effects of chemical castration such as the maintenance of bone 
density as well as maintenance of a normal, healthy sex life. This safety margin is based on the 
NK3 -selective modulation of LH, but not FSH, and this is the anticipated advantage of ESN364 
over the existing GnRH p roducts currently prescribed (eg , Lupron®, Zoladex®, etc.).  
In addition to  the precede nt established by [CONTACT_830581], an additional clinical 
precedence has been established by [CONTACT_830582]3 antagonists in clinical studies by 
[CONTACT_830583]. The therapeutic goal at the time was the treatment of 
schizophrenia , wherein all compounds failed due to lack o f convincing efficacy in Phase 2  studies. 
Importantly, these development programs report dose -related changes in LH, testosterone , and 
various reproductive organs (testes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], and prostate)  in male dog s and a

Protocol Version 4.0 (incl. Amendments)  
[ADDRESS_1152917] in male volunteers .17 This history indicates that NK3 antagonism is a 
target  concept for drug development with clinical precedence to reversibly lower sex hormones.  
As described above, the KNDy neurons are sensitive to NKB/NK3R signaling that is susceptible 
to pharmacological blockade by [CONTACT_830584]364 to decrease KNDy neuron activity. I mportantly, estro gen 
also acts directly on the alpha estrogen receptor  expressed on KNDy neurons to similarly decrease 
KNDy neuron activity .18,[ADDRESS_1152918]. The KNDy neuron is known to synapse 
at 2 sites: (1) the GnRH neuron, as explained earlier, and (2) the median preoptic nucleus which is 
an area of the brain critical for autonomic thermoregulation .20 Furthermore, additional evidence 
linking NK3R signali ng on KNDy neuron activity to vasomotor symptom /thermoregulation 
includes the observations that (1) administration of  NKB (NK 3R agonist) provoked vasomotor 
symptoms  in premenopausal women ,21 (2) administration of ESN364 (NK3 antagonist) prevented 
body temperature changes in ovarie ctomized ewe ,10 and (3) the demonstration of a significant 
association between risk of vasomotor symptom s and genetic variation in tachykinin receptor 322 
(see Figure 2).

01 Aug 2018  24 1.2 Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
A series of non -Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP) and GLP nonclinical studies were carried out in 
order to define the pharmacodynamics  (PD) , pharmacokinetics  (PK),  and toxicity of the test 
product ESN364. Compound affinity to human NK3 R and to rat and monkey NK3 R orthologs 
were confirmed via in vitro studies. R eceptor -ligand affinity for ESN [ADDRESS_1152919]  level (NOAEL) and to determine the starting 
dose in the Phase 1 clinical study.  
In the nonclinical toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, ESN 364 was well tolerated  and the 
NOAEL was considered to be 25 mg /kg/day in Cynomolgus monkeys,  the most relevant species; 
drug exposure ( ie, AUC) at this dose level in C ynomolgus monkey was similar to drug exposure 
levels measured in premenopausal women dosed at 540 mg/day. The main events that were 
observed in the nonclinical studies were considered to be rel ated to the pharmacology of ESN 364, 
including reduction of the ovarian activity in female monkeys. Adverse events were only observed  
at the very high doses used in the noncl inical  studies. The NOAEL exceeded the intended clinical 
doses by a factor of 20 . In monkeys, high doses of ESN 364 resulted in weight loss and 
histopathological changes such as hyperplasia of lymphocytes in lymph nodes, spleen , and lung, 
as well as perivas cular inflammation in the kidney. In addition, a reduction in platelet counts 
considered to be due to decreased production in bone marrow resulted in observations of 
hemorrhage and regenerative anemia; these effects were recoverable with discontinuation of  
dosing. In  rats, very high dose levels were  associated with death and marked clinical signs 
(including lethargy, reduced activity, labored respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , and staggering), and body weight loss 
during the first few days of treatment.  
In a [ADDRESS_1152920] ug ESN364, but 
rather a stress -and-fear reaction (expert report from Brunner Naga Health Science Consulting, 
Switzerland, available upon request). In order to evaluate the potent ial of ESN364 to produce 
seizures in rats, a long -term central nervous system toxicity study was conducted. In this study, no 
seizures were detected throughout the st udy based on review of video -electroencephalogram 
records. In addition, no convulsions wer e observed in a subsequent 6 -month study in rat conducted 
at exactly the same dose levels (NOAEL of 200 mg/kg/d). Therefore, it was concluded that the 
convulsive epi[INVESTIGATOR_830561] 3 -month study were unlikely to be related to ESN364 
administration. N otably, no signs of convulsive activity were observed in 3 -month and 9 -month 
toxicology studies in non human primates, nor in any of the clinical studies conducted.  
Reproductive toxicology studies on both rats and rabbits demonstrated significant litter los s in both 
animal species at high dose levels;  however , the surviving embryos did not show any adverse effect 
on development. The litter loss in this case is to be regarded as a pharmacologic effect on the

completed in rat without any reported adverse events (NOAEL of  100 mg/kg/d).

A second P hase 1 clinical trial exploring the maximum tolerated dose  (MTD)  of ESN364 in healthy 
female and healthy male volunteers has been recently completed ( ESN-364-CPK -102). Dose 
ranges between [ADDRESS_1152921] 
been given in a multiple dose fashion for 7 consecutive days. It was decided that 900 mg ESN364 
was to be the MTD because of the occurrence of  headache and facial paresthesia (a feeling of 
numbness around the mouth and face). This complaint was reported at 540 mg (reported start times 
around 40 minutes postdose). The reported paresthesia tended to become more pronounced and 
prolonged with increa sing doses. The apparent dose -dependent nature of the event, together with 
the occurrence of some moderate headaches, led to the decision to stop further escalation. The 
subsequent 7 -day multiple dose part was conducted using 540 mg and 720 mg of ESN364 once 
daily ( QD) in healthy female volunteers. These dose levels were well tolerated  and safe.  
Three P hase 2a trials (proof -of-concept) have been initiated in 3 separate therapeutic indications : 
polycystic ovary syndrome (ESN -364-PCO -201), heavy menstrual ble eding due to uterine fibroids 
(ESN -364-UF-02), and   
Based on the collected clinical and nonclini cal safety data, it can be concluded  that doses up to 
360 mg/day can be safely administered over a 3 -month dosing period. Dose ranges that cover an 
appropriate 10-fold range between 20 mg/day and 180 mg/ day will allow exploration of a  dose 
response in the patients .

to uterine fibroids (ESN -364-UF-02). The results of these Phase [ADDRESS_1152922] current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for additional details.  
1.4 Rationale  
ESN364 has been selected as the development candidate molecule based on its superior  PK profile, 
oral bioavailability , and selective target potency. The summary of clinical studies supports the 
rationale for the current trial to refine both the d ose-level and dosing regimen in order to define 
the minimal effective dos e level of fezolinetant to treat  moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms.  
1.5 Risk/Benefit  
ESN364 is being developed for the treatment of women’s health disorders such as menopausal 
vasom otor symptoms , endometriosis, p olycystic ovarian syndrome , and uterine fibroids. The 
compound may also be developed for sex hormone disorders affecting men, such as benign 
prostate hyperplasia . 
Due to recent advances in science, there are reasons to believ e that ESN364 can be an effective 
treatment for the symptoms and morbidity associated with menopause.  
A key feature of NK3 antagonism is the selective decrease of LH secretion without compromising 
FSH secretion by [CONTACT_830585]. 
When given to normally cycling healthy women, ESN364 is capable of altering the menstrual 
cycle and decreasing the circulating levels of E2, LH, progesterone (P4), and testosterone.  Since 
this study aims to includ e postmenopausal volunteers, these eff ects will become of less importance 
because of the physiological changes that happen in the climacterium (anovulation with loss of P4 
and E2 production, and consequently increase of LH/FSH).  
In terms of hormonal changes, a mild to  moderate decrease of the already elevated LH and FSH 
plasma levels  is anticipated . There are no known r isks associated with this decrease of the 
gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_830562].

01 Aug 2018  29 Treatment with ESN364 can cause adverse effects or other symptoms. Adverse effects that can be 
expected are those adverse events that presented in ESN364 clinical trials in healthy male and 
female volunteers as well as in menopausal women.  
Details of the adverse event profile from the proof -of-concept study are presented in Section 1.3. 
All recorded treatment -related TEAEs  were mild to moderate in severity. All adverse events  
resolved spontaneously without sequelae . The reported palpi[INVESTIGATOR_830563] -lived and were not 
accompanied by [CONTACT_830586]/symptoms of cardiac involvement (vital signs and electrocardiogram 
[ECG ] findings  were normal).  Current knowledge of the side effect pro file of ESN364 is still 
limited.  
 
 
  
Indirectly , subject s could benefit from participating in this clinical trial because of the intense 
medical follow -up demanded by [CONTACT_830587].

5.1 Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups  in an equal  ratio (see Table 1).

Dose, Regimen, Route  Number of Subjects  Total E SN364 Daily Dose  
ESN364 15 mg BID, oral  44 30 mg

5.[ADDRESS_1152931]-in-human Phase 1  study , the mid -range dose of ESN364  (60 mg/day ) was demonstrated to be 
associated with a submaximal LH suppression, and thus a submaximal suppression of the KNDy 
neuron. ESN364 gi ven as a dose of 180  mg/day was also tested in the first -in-human Phase 1 study 
and was demonstrated t o be safe and well tolerated . Luteinizing hormone  suppression was 
maximal with this dose level . Hence, the expectation is that the 180 mg dose represents the dose 
associated with maximal suppression of the KNDy neuron.  
During menopause, the negative feedback by E2  does not occur  due to the cessation of estrogen 
production in the ovaries. The loss of negative E2 feedback causes  the KNDy neuron to become 
hyperactive in an attempt to restore the needed E2 levels via the increased release of LH/FSH.  
When the KNDy neuron is in the hyperactive state, as it is presumed to be in th e postmenopausal 
period, a QD morning dose of ESN364 is unlikely to yield the desir ed suppression of KNDy at 
night to prevent night sweats. For this reason, a high dose of ESN364 (total daily dose of 180 mg ) 
given as [ADDRESS_1152932] that is widely seen in vasomotor

Randomization will be based on  a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared by 
[CONTACT_233570], Inc. Biostatistics using SAS® software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) prior to the 
start of the study. The randomization will be balanced using randomly permuted blocks across the

management, clinical, medical, or statistical review of the study data, will also be blinded during 
the study as they will not have access to the randomization list. Medpace, the Contract Research 
Organization (CRO) performing data management and statistical  activities, will receive a copy of

labeled “evening”) at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 8 (Visit 4). Each bottle will 
contain  34 capsules of ESN364 or placebo.  Study drug  should be dispensed under  the supervision 
of the Investigator, a qualified member of the clinical staff, or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist .  
All study visits  should be conducted in the morning. Subjects should be fasted  (defined as nothing 
by [CONTACT_830594]  [up to 1 hour before study drug intake]  for at least 10 hours prior to 
study visit). Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) should be planned to allow for first intake of study drug  (“morning” 
dose)  at the study  site between 7:00  AM and 10:00  AM. Following Day 1 ( Visit 2 ), each 
subsequent visit should be planned at the same time of day (morning) for each subject.  
Study drug intake will be done with a glass of room temperature tap water.  The first intake of study 
drug will take place  at the study  site on Day 1 (Visit 2) between 7:00  AM and 10:00 AM  under the 
supervision of the study  staff. On study visit days  (Day 1 [Visit 2], Week 4 [Visit 3], and Week 8 
[Visit 4], only) , the morning dose of study drug will be taken at  the study site under the supervision 
of the study  staff, after collection of predose blood samples. Subjects will be instructed  to arrive 
at the study site fasted ( defined as nothing by [CONTACT_24340] [up to 1 hour prior to study drug 
intake] for at l east 10 hours  prior to study visit ). On all other days throughout the treatment period, 
subjects will be instructed  to take their morning dose of study drug at home, around the same time 
of the day  and spaced as near to 12 hours apart as possible  (preferably between 7:00  AM and 
10:00  AM and 7:00 PM and 10:00 PM ). Intake of study drug should be preferably [ADDRESS_1152939] all home study drug intake  in the electronic Patient -Reported Outcome

clinical staff. All other study drug intakes (evening dose and morning dose on all da ys without 
visits) will take place at home. W hen taking study drug at home, subjects will be asked to record 
their home study drug intake in the ePRO diary. Subjects will also be asked to  return all unused 
study drug . 
Compliance of study drug intake will be assessed by [CONTACT_830595] . Any discrepancies bet ween returned study drug 
number  and dosing in the ePRO diary  will be discussed with the subject for whom a discrepancy 
was seen and recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. If a subject demonstrates continued 
non-compliance with study drug dosing  (85% compliance)  despi[INVESTIGATOR_693], the 
Investigator should contact [CONTACT_830596].  
5.5.5 Storage and Accountability  
The Investigator  (or his/her designee) is responsible for the safe storage of all study drug assigned 
to the study  site. Study drug will be stored  in a locked, secure storage facility with access limited 
to those individuals authorized to dispense the study drug  and maintained within the appropriate  
ranges of temperature. All study drug  must be stored as specified at delivery and in the original 
packaging.  Instructions for the subjects regarding the storage and handling of the study drug  will 
also be provided to the study sites.  
ESN364 must be stored at ambient conditions (15 °C to 30°C or 59 °F to 86°F),  should not be 
exposed to freezing temperatures, and should be protected from light during storage at the  study  
site. Study drug is stable up to 24 months at 25 °C with 60% relative humidity.  
Daily temperature logging of the study drug storage r oom at the study  site should be performed. 
In the event a  deviation in storage conditions should occur, the site must discontinue dispensing  
the affected study drug and notify the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) . The same instruction 
applies for temperat ure deviations occurring during shipment of study drug to the sites.  
The Investigator  is responsible for ensuring that all study drug  received at the study  site is 
inventoried  and acco unted for throughout the study. As misallocations of study drug  will have an 
impact on study execution and will jeopardize the validity of the data obtained,  utmost care should 
be taken to correctly dispense the study drug  as assigned by [CONTACT_240358].  
Subjects will be assigned 2 bottles of study drug  as a kit  (1 bottle labeled “morning” and 1  bottle 
labeled “evening”) at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 8 (Visit 4). Each bottle will 
contain 34  capsules of ESN364 or placebo.  Study drug  should be dispensed under  the supervision 
of the Investigator, a qualified member of the clinical staff, or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist. The 
Investigator must maintain accurate records demonstrating date and amount of study drug  supplied 
to whom and by [CONTACT_20898]. Study drug  will be supplied only to subjects participating in the study.

an ad hoc basis, but at a minimum twice daily  (morning and evening) , via the ePRO diary from  
the screening visit (Days -35 to -1 [Visit  1]) through the follow -up visit  (Week 15 [Visit 6]) . At 
the screening visit, subjects will receive the ePRO  diary in which to record daily vasomotor 
symptoms  during the screening period.  Subjects must have 7 consecutive days of vasomotor 
symptom  recordings to participate in the study . Data on vasomotor symptom  frequency and 
severity  collected during the screening period  (Days -35 to -1) will serve as baseline for vasomotor 
symptom  frequency and severity . Vasomotor symptoms  will be recorded by [CONTACT_168876] (ie, 1  day 
is midnight [12:00 AM (00:00 hours) ] to 11:59 PM [23:59 hours]).  
Night sweats  (vasomotor symptoms  that disrupt the subject ’s night  sleep)  should be recorded no 
later than  in the  morning upon a wakening to start a new day.  Subject s should take note of the time 
of the night sweat and record it on the appropriate calendar day (ie, before or after midnight).  
The severity of vasomotor symptoms  is defined clinically as follows (according to the FDA a nd 
European Medicines Agency Guidance s for Industry23,24 and the National Institutes of Health 
[NIH]  Hot Flash Workshop25): 
• Mild: Sensation of heat without s weating/dampness. If at night, subject  does not  wake up but 
later notices damp sheets or clothing.  
• Moderate: Sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but able to c ontinue activity. If at night, 
subject  wakes up because she is feeling hot and/or is sweating, but no action is necessary other 
than rearranging the bed sheets.  
• Severe: Sensation of intense heat with sweating, causing disrup tion of activity. If at night, 
subject  wakes up hot and is sweatin g and needs to take action (eg , remov e layers of clothes, 
open the window, or get out of bed).  
The definition of the main parameters are as follows:  
Frequency  
The frequency is the number of vasomotor symptoms per day.  
Severity  
Severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per day is calculated as follows:  
[(number of moderate vasomotor symptoms  2) + (number of severe vasomotor symptoms  3)]/ 
number of daily moderate/severe vasomotor symptoms  
Severity is zero for s ubjects that have no moderate or severe vasomotor symptoms.  
A weekly average severity is the average of the daily severity scores.

symptoms  
Severity is zero for subjects that have no hot flashes.  
A weekly average severity is the average of the daily  severity scores.  
Hot Flash S core 
Hot flash score per day is calculated as follows:  
(number of moderate vasomotor symptoms  2) + (number of severe vasomotor symptoms  3) 
Frequency, severity, and hot flash score will be assessed by [CONTACT_830597] 7  days.  
8.1.2 Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale  
Perceived vasomotor symptom  interference on daily activities will be evaluated at Day  1 (Visit 2), 
Week 4 (Vis it 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), Week 12 (Visit 5) /ET, and the follow -up visit (Week 15 
[Visit  6]) using the HFRDIS. The HFRDIS will be paper -based and administered at the study site 
prior to  any invasive procedures.   
The HFRDIS is a 10 -item scale that measures a woman’s perceptions of the degree to which 
vasomotor symptoms  interfere with 9 daily life activities ( work, social activities, leisure, sleep, 
mood, concentration, relations with others, sexuality, and enjoying life ); the 10th item measures 
interference wi th overall quality of life .[ADDRESS_1152966] 
interfered with each item during the previous 2-week time interval using a 0 (do not interfere) to 
10 (completely interfere) scale. Recent structural equation modeling suggests this is a 
unidimensional scale best repres ented by [CONTACT_830598] (sum of items/10) .[ADDRESS_1152967]  sleep quality will be evaluated at Day 1 (Visit 2 ), Week 4 (Visit  3), Week 8 (Visit 4) , 
Week  12 (Visit 5) /ET, and at the f ollow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) using the LSEQ . A baseline 
questionnaire will be used at Day 1 (Visit 2) and a post -baseline questionnaire will be used at all 
other visits. The qu estionnaire will be paper -based and administered at the study site prior to  any

perceived quality of sleep, ease of awaking from sleep, and integrity of ear ly morning behavior 
following wakefulness .[ADDRESS_1152969] experienced in a variety of 
symptoms compared to usual (baseline version) versus since the beginning of treatment  
(post -baseline version) . Lines  extend between extremes like “more difficult than usual” and “easier

(Visit 4), Week 12 (Visit 5) /ET, and at the follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) using the GCS. The 
questionnaire will be paper -based and administered at the study site prior to any invasive 
procedures.  
The GCS is  a 21-item scale that  provides a brief but comprehensive and valid measure of 
climacteric symptomatology .[ADDRESS_1152970] ing to its severity using a 
4-point rating scale from 0 (no ne) to 3 ( severe ). The first 20  items of the scale comb ine into 3 main 
independent symptom measures  by [CONTACT_830599] : psychological 
symptoms (items 1 to 11; score 0 to 33), physical symptoms (items 12 to 18; score 0 to 21), and 
vasomotor symptoms (items 19 to 20; score 0 to 6). Item 21 is a probe for sexual dysfunction. The 
total score can range from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.  
8.1.5 Menopause -Specific Quality of Life  
The MENQoL questionnaire will be recorded at Day 1 (Visit 2 ), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 
(Visit  4), Week  12 (Visit 5)/ET , and at the f ollow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]). The questionnaire 
will be paper -based and administered at the study site prior to  any invasive procedures . 
The MENQoL  questionnaire was introduced in [ADDRESS_1152971] menopausal period. An inherent assumption of the MENQoL  is that 
disease states and conditions like menopause  produce symptoms that  may disrupt emotional, 
physical, and social aspects of an individual’s life, and must be con sidered concomitantly with 
treatment decisions. The MENQoL  improves upon several instruments used to assess the impact 
of menopausal symptoms on quality of life, including the Kupperman Index and the General 
Well-Being Scale, in the following ways: 1) spec ificity to the condition of menopause; 2) item 
development based upon women’s own qualitative and quantitative accounts of menopausal 
symptoms; 3) inclusion of all pertinent domains of the menopause experience, including sexual 
symptoms; and 4) demonstrate d reliability and validity . 
The MENQoL  is self -administered and consists of a total of [ADDRESS_1152972] month: vasomotor (items 1 to 3), psychosocial (items 4 to 10), physical (items 11 to 26), 
and sexual (items 27 to 29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not 
present, and if pr esent, how bothersome on a 0 (not bothersome) to 6 (extremely bothersome) 
scale.32,33 Means are computed for each subscale by [CONTACT_830600]’s items by [CONTACT_830601] n.33 Non-endorsement of an item is scored a “1” and 
endorsement a “2,” plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible s core on any item 
ranges from 1  to 8.34

Venous blood samples will be collected for PD assessments at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3),  
Week 8 (Visit 4),  Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , and at the f ollow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) . Subjects 
should be fasted (defined as nothing by [CONTACT_24340] [up to 1 hour before study drug intake] 
for at least [ADDRESS_1152973] 1 hour after dosing.  
Samples will be taken predose at Day 1 (Visit 2) , Week  8 (Visit 4), and Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , as 
well as predose and 3 hours postdose at Week  4 (Visit 3 ). The Week 4 (Visit 3) 3-hour postdose 
PD sample  should be shifted to a later date in case s where  the subject c annot accommodate the 
PK sampling schedule at that visit.  The PD sample should be taken at the same time as the 3 -hour 
postdose PK  sample (see Section 8.2). A PD sa mple will be taken at the follow -up visit (Week 15 
[Visit 6]) as well. Markers include LH, FSH, E2, and SHBG .  
The exact date and time of blood sampling must be recorded in the source documents and on the 
eCRF.  Plasma will be collected  and handled as speci fied in the central laboratory manual.  After 
appropriate labeling, the plasma samples will be stored below -70°C at the study site . Thereafter, 
the frozen plasma samples will be transported/shipped on dry  ice to the central laboratory  for

Safety variables will include adverse events, C -SSRS, endometrial health assessment (transvaginal 
ultrasound  endometrial biopsy), clinical laboratory tests, plasma bone density marker 
concentrations, ECGs, vital signs, and physical examinations, as described in the following 
sections.  
9.[ADDRESS_1152974] a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
sympt oms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and 
documented from the time of informed consent until s tudy participation is complete . Subjects 
should be instructed to re port any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator . 
Investigators should make an assessment for adverse events at each visit  (excluding Visits 2A, 3A, 
and 4A) and record the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a spe cific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_239636]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737] , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse ev ent, not the procedure.  
Any medical  condition already present at the screening visit will be recorded as medical history 
and should not be reported as an adverse event . Any medical condition or signs or symptoms 
present at screening that change in severit y or seriousness at any time during the study should be 
reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( eg, ECG ) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at the screening  visit and significantly worsen during the 
study should be reported as adverse event s. The Investigator  will exercise his or her medical and 
scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clinically signifi cant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring 
during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no 
longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does n ot require 
reporting as an adverse event .

01 Aug 2018  60 9.1.2 Adverse (Drug) Reac tion 
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considere d an adverse drug reaction . “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at l east a reasonable possibility, 
ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
9.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_349988] (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize eac h adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug 
using  the categories of yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity : 
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is suffi ciently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality Assessment : 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the stu dy drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and a nother 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no oth er cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments  to sugges t a causal relationship.  
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the 
disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant drug - 
o The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in 
question.

o Clinical and/or noncl inical  data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be 
a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical 
and better explanation for the ev ent. 
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug - 
o The known pharmacologic properties ( ADME ) of the study drug should be considered.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death , 
• A life -threatening adverse event , 
o NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view 
of either the Investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the su bject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889] , 
o NOTE : Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1 overnig ht stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency room visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255594] a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or

not be considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
• A persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions , 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect , or 
• An important medical event.  
o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospit alization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development 
of drug dependency.

• Hematology: white blood cell count with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils , 
monocytes, and basophils), hemoglob in, hematocrit, red blood cell  count, and platelet s. 
Serology (HBsAG, HCV, and HIV antibodies) will be completed at the screening visit.  
Urinalysis will be performed on site using a comme rcial urine dipstick. In the event the  dipstick 
result is positive, a urine sample must be shipped to a central laboratory f or urine sediment analysis  
(see Appendix B for list of urinalysis analytes) . 
Urine drug screen for amphetamine s, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], tricyclic antidepressants, cannabinoids, 
cocaine , or opi[INVESTIGATOR_830569].  Note that testing positive for 
cannabinoids will not exclude a subject from participating the study. A subject  with an active 
prescription for opi[INVESTIGATOR_830570].  
The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any change 
occurring d uring the study considered  to be c linically relevant in the source documents and in the  
adverse events section of the eCRF. Laboratory values outside the laboratory normal range will be 
flagged and their clinical relevance will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]. A copy of all laboratory 
reports must be filed in the subject’s medical records.  
Samples that remain after protocol -specific assessments have been performed may be used for 
further exploratory work on PK, metabolites, plasma protein binding, protein analysis, and 
biochemistry . 
9.8 Bone Tu rnover Markers  
Plasma concentrations of the bone turnover markers BALP, P1NP , and CTX will be assessed at 
Day 1 ( Visit 2 ), Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , and f ollow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) .

Vital sign parameters will be assessed  at each study visit  (excluding Visits 2A, 3A, and 4A). 
The vital sign parameters that will be assessed are body temperature (oral /tympanic ), blood 
pressure (sitting), and pulse rate (supi[INVESTIGATOR_81995] [ADDRESS_1152982]) . These parameters will be 
measured using a completely automated device consisting of an inflatable cuff and an oscillatory 
detection system. All values will be registered on a built -in recorder so that measurements are  
observer -independent.  
Any change from baseline in vital sign values occurring during the study that is considered to be 
clinically relevant or that requires concomitant medication , as judged by [CONTACT_737] , should 
be recorded in the source documents and the  adverse event  section of the eCRF.  Refer to 
Appendix  E for normal ranges for vital sign parameters.  
9.10 Electrocardiograms  
Twelve -lead digital ECGs will be obtai ned at each study visit  (excluding Visits 2A, 3A, and 4A) 
after 10 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] . Whenever vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs, and blood draws are 
scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments should occur in the following order: [ADDRESS_1152983] 12 -lead 
ECG placement.  
Electrocardiogram s will be digitally recorded and printed on paper. All 12 -lead ECGs will be 
captured in triplic ate (ie, [ADDRESS_1152984] 1 to 2 minutes apart within a 5 -minute 
window). The printed paper ECGs will be used for “real time”  bedside ECG assessment by [CONTACT_3786] (or designee) who will be responsible for the overall interpretation an d determination 
of the clinical significance of any potential ECG findings. Digital ECGs will be submitted to the 
ECG core lab oratory , which will perform the digital ECG analysis and interpretation in this study 
using standard methodology. If the central r eader identifies an abnormality, per the study alert 
criteria, the Investigator will be notified who will review the ECG and report any adverse event s 
as necessary.  
The following variables will be reported: HR, RR, PR,  QRS, QT,  QTcB, and QTcF intervals. The 
Investigator may add additional  12-lead ECG safety assessments if there are a ny abnormal findings 
or if the I nvestigator considers it is required for any other safety reason.  Refer to Appendix  E for 
normal ranges for ECG parameters.  
9.11 Physical Examinations  
Physical ex aminations will be performed at the screening visit (Days -35 to -1 [Visit 1]), Day 1 
(Visit 2), Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , and the follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]). A limited physical 
examination (weight and waist circumference only) will be performed at Week 4 (Visit 3) and 
Week 8 (Visit  4).  
The p hysical examination includes height  (at screening only), weight, and waist circumf erence. 
To obtain the actual body weight, subjects must be weighed lightly clothed. The height should be 
measured barefoot. Waist circumference will be measured according to NIH guideline s (see

Monitoring   
Subjects will be monitored for liver function tests throughout the study, including transaminases, 
total bilirubin, complete blood count, serum alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time/INR, and 
creatine kinase.  If a subject develops a liver function test abnormality, promptly investigate with 
repeat biochemical and physical evaluation and notify the CRA immediately  (refer to Section 4.3 
for detailed procedures) . 
9.14.1  Abnormal Liver Function  
Weekly monitoring of  liver function tests  is required under the following conditions:  
• Subject with a non -elevated liver function test at baseline is found to  have any abnormal liver 
function test elevation that does not meet the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_830571] 
(Section  9.4) or withdrawal criteria (Section 4.4); or  
• Subject who is enrolled with a baseline liver function test that is 1.5  ULN  and subsequently 
has an elevation 2  that of the baseline value.  
Weekly mo nitoring shall continue for these subjects until their liver function tests return to below

• Elevation in ALT and/or AST >3  ULN.  
9.16 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS will be collected at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , and the follow -up visit 
(Week  15 [Visit 6]) .  
The C -SSRS will be used to  assess all suicidal events and pro vide a summary of suicidal ideation 
and behavior. It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, 
duration, controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly 
predictive of completed suic ide. The questionnaire will be paper -based and administered at the 
study site prior to any invasive procedures.  
9.17 Transvaginal Ultrasound  
Subjects will undergo trans vaginal ultrasound at screening,  Week 12 (end -of-treatment), and, for 
subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion,  at the ET Visit. The endometrium 
should be measured in the long axis or sagittal plane . The measurement is of the thickest echogenic 
area from one basal endometrial interface across the en dometrial canal to the other basal surface. 
Care should be taken not to include the hypoechoic myometrium in this measurement.  All 
transvaginal ultrasounds will  be read by a local reader to determine endometrial biopsy eligibility 
followed by a central reading.  
In the event a subject has endometrial fibroids, the subject must undergo endometrial biopsy. 
Subjects with endometrial fibroids  may be included in the s tudy provided the endometrial biopsy

4 co-primary efficacy variables, a two -tier closed testing procedure will be used to control the 
famil y-wise error. A step -down tes ting procedure will be followed. T he following testing order of 
doses will be employed:  
a. Placebo versus 90 mg BID (daily dose 180 mg),  
b. Placebo versus 60 mg BID (daily dose 120 mg),  
c. Placebo versus 120 mg QD (daily dose 120 mg),  
d. Placebo versus 30 mg BID (daily dose 60 mg),  
e. Placebo versus 60 mg QD (daily dose 60 mg),  
f. Placebo versus 15 mg BID (daily dose 30 mg), and

a. Study visits  should be conducted in the morning. Subjects should be  fasted  (defined as nothing by  [CONTACT_830594] [up to 1 hour before study drug intake] for at least 
10 hours prior to study visit). All assessments will be completed predose, except for postdose blood sampling for PK  and PD assessments at Week 4 (Visit  3). A dministration 
of questionnaires  will be completed at the respective visits prior to  any i nvasive pr ocedures . Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) should be planned to allow for the first intake of study drug  at the 
study  site between 7:00  AM and 10:00  AM. Following Day 1 ( Visit 2 ), each subsequent visit should be planned at the same time of day (morning) for each subject.  Following 
randomization to study drug, s ubjects will return  to the study site for visits and procedures to occur within 3 days of the scheduled time . Unscheduled visits can be planned 
outside the scheduled visits  (see Section 6.6).  
b. The screening visit is to occur within 35 days of randomization  (Day 1  [Visit 2]), with a minimum of [ADDRESS_1153016] 
7 consecutive days of vasomotor symptom recordings to participate in the study. Subjects may be rescreened 1 time upon approval of the Medical Monitor . The following 
assessments do not need to be repeated at the rescreen provided they still fall within the acceptable time window: transvagin al ultrasound, endometr ial biopsy, mammogram,  
, ECG , and Pap smear . 
c. Subjects may schedule Week 2 (Visit 2A), Week 6 (Visit 3A), and Week 10 (Visit 4A) assessments at their convenience within the visit window ( 3 days). Fasting is not 
required for these visits.  
d. The follow -up visit will  occur approx imately [ADDRESS_1153017] dose of study drug . For subjects requiring a repeat biopsy, the follow -up visit will occur 4 weeks after 
Week 12 (Visit 5).   
e. Signed informed consent will be collected for all subjects before any study -related procedures are done. A separate signature [CONTACT_830613]. Subjects 
who do not consent to PGX sampling are not excluded from participating in the study.   
f. Only in the event the subject does not have  a normal/negative or no clinically significant  findings mammogram from previous [ADDRESS_1153018].  
g. Includes age, race, sex, and smoking status (smoker/non -smoker).   
h. Includes height (at the screening visit  only ), weight  and waist circumference. A bimanual clinical pelvic and clinical breast examination will be performed at the screening 
visit. A bimanual clinical pelvic examination can be performed at any time in the study where clinically indicated.   
i. Weight and waist circumference only.  
j. Includes biochemistry, coagulation (at the screening visit and Week 12  [Visit 5]/ET  only ), and hematology panel. Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests should be taken 
in a fasted state (define d as nothing by [CONTACT_830610] 10 hours) , except for Week 2 (Visit 2A), Week 6 (Visit 3A), and Week 10 (Visit 4A) .

(Visit  3) [ADDRESS_1153023] cannot accommodate the PK sampling schedule at that visit. The PD sample 
should be taken at the same time as the 3 -hour postdose PK sample (see Section 8.2). A PD sample will be taken at the follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) as well. Markers 
include LH, FSH, E2, and SHBG.  
r. Samples to be taken  Week 4 (Visit 3) predose and 1 h ( 30 min), 3 h (30 min), 5 h ( -1 h/+30 min) , and 7 h ( -1 h/+2  h) postdose as well  as pre dose Week 12 (Visit 5) . The 
indicated time windows for Week 4 (Visit 3) PK sampl ing will allow for flexibility.  
s. While schedule d for Week 12 (Visit 5), the PGX sample can be taken at any time during the study following signed informed consent and en rollment into the study.  
t. The vasomotor symptom diary will be kept by [CONTACT_1766] . Subjects  will record the  vasomotor  symptom frequency and severity of each vasomotor symptom  in the ePRO diary  
on an ad hoc basis, but at a minimum  twice daily  (morning and evening) , from the screening  visit (Days -35 to -1 [Visit  1]) through the  follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) . 
Night sweats should be recorded  no later than  in the m orning upon awakening to start a new day.  
u. Paper -based, administered at the study site prior  to any invasive procedures.   
v. A baseline LSEQ assessment will be collected at Day 1 (Visit 2). A post -baseline LSEQ assessment will be collected for all other indicated visits.  
w.  
 
 
  
x. Includes BALP, P1NP, and CTX.  
y. Subjects will be assigned 2 bottles of study drug  as a kit  (1 bottle labeled “morning” and 1  bottle labeled “evening”) at Day 1 (Visit 2), We ek 4 (Visit 3) , and Week 8 
(Visit  4). Each bottle will contain [ADDRESS_1153024]  at the study site  on Day 1 (Visit 2) between 7:00 AM  and 10:00 AM, under the supervision of the study  staff. On study visit days  (Day 1 [Visit 2], Week 4 
[Visit 3], and Week 8 [Visit 4], only) , the morning dose of study drug will be taken at the study site, under the supervision of the study  staff, after collection of predose blood 
samples. Subjects will be instructed  to arrive at  the study site fasted (nothing by [CONTACT_24340] [up to 1 hour prior to study drug intake] for at least 10 hours). On all 
other days throughout the treatment per iod, subjects will be instructed to take their morning dose of study drug at home, around the same time of the day spaced as near to 
12 hours apart as possible (preferably between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM  and 7:00 PM and 10:00 PM ). Intake of study drug should be preferably [ADDRESS_1153025] for whom a d iscrepancy was seen and recorded in the source documents and the eCRF.  
aa. Adverse events and intake of concomitant medication(s) will be monitored continuously from informed consent until the last st udy-related activity.

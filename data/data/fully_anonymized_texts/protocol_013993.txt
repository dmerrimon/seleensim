 Prevention of overt hypothyroidism following radioactive iodine therapy for Graves’ 
disease; a novel protocol with implications for future studies  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_223702] N. Stan, MD 
I. Specific Aims  
We aim to test the hypothesis that early treatment with levothyroxine after radioactive therapy for Graves’ 
disease will prevent overt hypothyroidism (primary outcome).  
II. Background and Significance  
The most common method of treating Graves’ disease (GD) in  the US relies on rendering the patient 
hypothyroid with the use of radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation of the thyroid gland followed by [CONTACT_223707] (levothyroxine). Our current practice is to reevaluate GD patients 2-[ADDRESS_269208] been resolved, 
however the majority are clearly hypothyroid at that point. While many are asymptomatic or minimally 
symptomatic, some are frankly hypothyroid with related troublesome symptoms (cold intolerance, 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], fatigue, weight gain, hoarse voice etc.).  
We and others have identified hypothyroidism following treatment of GD as a risk factor for the 
development of future Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO), a potentially v ision -threatening complication of 
GD
1-3. These studies show that development of hypothyroidism increases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_223703] 3.3. Cohort data from centers where early levothyroxine replacement is routinely 
administered following RAI therapy 1,4 suggests that this approach  can decre ase the risk of GO 
development. In addition, these data show a very low occurrence of  hyperthyroidism symptoms that may 
present when levothyroxine is given prior to documentation of hypothyroidism. Based on these data, the 
recent publication of guidelines  for the treatment of patients with hyperthyroidism5 (with Drs. Bahn and 
Stan as task -force chair and member) recommended that hypothyroidism be avoided following RAI 
therapy for GD. However, no randomized trial has yet been performed to test the impact of preventing hypothyroidism through a precise protocol of early T4 administration on both GO development and QOL, 
a lapse that our trial intends to correct.  
Completion of our current study t o test the hypothesis that early initiation of levothyroxine following a 
precise protocol using small doses of the medication can prevent development of overt hypothyroidism 
without an increase in rate of symptomatic hyperthyroidism  is necessary before we can design our 
subsequent study. That study will be a larger multi -center investigation testing the hypothesis that 
prevention of overt hypothyroidism after RAI using this (or a refined) protocol can prevent development or worsening of GO and at the same time improve the quality of life of these individuals.  
III.  Progress Report and Preliminary Studies  
This project involves performing a therapeutic trial in patients with GD. I have to date participated in [ADDRESS_269209] acebo -controlled trial that involved administration of octreotide or 
placebo for therapy of active GO. My participation in that trial included data collection, data analysis and drafting of the final manuscript. The second trial (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED];PI:[INVESTIGATOR_223704]) 
is an ongoing placebo- controlled study that tests the benefit of rituximab in patients with active and 
moderate- to-severe GO. I was involved in designing the trial and I’m currently enrolling and following 
patients throughout the trial. The third trial (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is another 
ongoing study testing the impact of teriparatide on the duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_223705], in 
patients that develop postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. I am the PI i n this single arm study with historical 
controls. We expect to complete patient enrollment by [CONTACT_5638] 2014. In addition to these trials we have 
just published our retrospective cohort results describing the development of hypothyroidism in patients 
with GD treated with RAI, and its impact on GO development3. This cohort is very similar to the group of 
patients that we intend to enroll in the current study. Lastly, I have completed a Masters in Clinical Research and Translational Sciences through the Mayo Clinic CTSA. This training has given me 
important background in clinical study protocol design to data analysis.   
In our review of Mayo Clinic 
records, the majority 
(102/195;52%) of patients were 
overtly hypothyroid by [CONTACT_223708] (Fig.1) and 36% had a TSH value 
> 20 mIU/L.
3 Furthermore, we 
found that 21% of patients are in reality seen for their first re turn 
visit after > [ADDRESS_269210] RAI 
due to practicalities of scheduling 
and the lack of a standardized 
protocol for this process. We 
found that the  prevalence of 
hyperthyroidism decreased as 
expected between the 2 groups 
and dropped below 25% in groups 
with first follow -up after 6 weeks. We calculated the ratio between euthyroidism and hypothyroidism at 
each follow -up and found the ration to drop below 1.0, favoring hypothyroidism, starting from follow -up 
period 8- 10 weeks and then to decrease linearly thereafter. It is very likely that the development of 
hypothyroidism in the latter groups is associated with a significant symptomatic hypothyroidism and decrease in patients’ quality of life (QOL).  
 
 
  
 
Fig.[ADDRESS_269211] follow -up visit was strongly 
associated with GO development or deterioration with OR of 3.3, 95% CI:1.3-
8.7,p=0.011 (Fig. 2). A multi -variate 
analysis was performed and included hypothyroidism status at the first  follow -
up, the administration of corticosteroids concurrently with RAI, smoking status, 
fT4 level at baseline, gender, age, [ADDRESS_269212] follow -up visit after RAI therapy 
(OR=3.6) and preexisting GO (OR=2.8; Table 2).  
 
 
IV.  Research Design and Methods  
 
a. Study Design/Overview  –The design for this study was developed based upon the findings of our 
retrospective cohort study described above.  We propose a randomized trial w ith [ADDRESS_269213], approximately 4 weeks after RAI therapy. The initial dose of levothyroxine will be 25 
mcg/day. It will be increased to 50 mcg/day [ADDRESS_269214] RAI based on 
a full face- to-face clinical and biochemical evaluation. At the 8 weeks visit the treating physician can be 
informed about the randomization status (actual levothyroxine dose received by [CONTACT_102]). This will be 
done only if requested by [CONTACT_223709], after communication with the research 
pharmacy. Both the active capsules and the placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_223710], who 
will also coordinate the randomization process. In the control arm patients will receive placebo capsules and be evaluated for levothyroxine therapy during a full face -to-face evaluation at [ADDRESS_269215] blood drawn at 4 and 6 weeks ( in 
[COMPANY_002]ster if agreed by [CONTACT_223711] -in kit to maximize the percent of data collection ), stored and 
analyzed at a later time  (batch processing for limiting costs) for free thyroxine and TSH .  The study

groups a quality of life instrument will be used at baseline, 4, 6 and 8 weeks and at 6 months. We will use 
the hypothyroid- Health Related Quality of Life (hypothyroid- HRQL)7 and also the Thyroid Specific 
Questionnaire (TSQ)8. These  questionnaire s are  disease -specific for hyp othyroidism. A major advantage 
to our study is also their ability to be self -administered. These last 2 interventions will be used to assess 
the feasibility of using them in the larger, multi- center trial where GO prevention and QOL benefit will be 
the pri mary outcomes.

b. Study Subjects  - Inclusion criteria target all adult patients (ages 18 -70 years) with GD who will receive 
RAI for treatment of GD. We plan to have [ADDRESS_269217] GO will be excluded from 
the study. We will also exclude patients with recent (<1 yr.) history of arrhythmias or any history of 
ventricular arrhythmias, those with p reexistent cardiomyopathy, those with malnutrition and those with 
psychiatric history that could get worse if patient remains persistently hyperthyroid. Patients unlikely to 
return for the planned follow -up visits, to comply with the blood drawing schedule  and with the 
completion of the hypothyroid- HDQL and TQS  questionnaires will also be excluded.  If a medical 
examination was performed within the last [ADDRESS_269218] we can discuss the study over 
the phone. The consent material can be exchang ed by [CONTACT_166740]. 
 
d. Data Collection - The data will be collected prospectively and stored in an electronic database. 
Baseline assessment will include demographic data, thyroid size, thyroid functional parameters (TSH, T4 and T3 levels), RAI uptake and dose, smoking status and history of therapy with corticosteroids or 
methimazole (pre and post RAI) . The development of hypothyroidism is defined as TSH > 3.0 mIU/L or 
free thyroxine (fT4) < 0.8 ng/dL. The methodology for thyroid functional parameters will be the currently 
used clinical assays. We will offer blood collection for all the required samples here in [COMPANY_002]ster. For Intervention group - 6 months - Control group

those patients that are not local the blood drawing will be organized with the help of mail -in kits. This 
will maximize the likelihood  of the tests being completed and the study coordinator will follow with the 
patients over the phone to ensure that this process will happen.  
g. Feasibility and Time Frame  - Our own data indicate that every year 150 patients with Graves’ 
hyperthyroidism who are evaluated at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster by [CONTACT_223712], MNS or one of other members of 
the Endocrinology Division and Thyroid Core Group. This group of physicians collaborates closely on 
clinical studies and would in all likelihood refer their patients with GD f or participation in this study. We 
would therefore expect to be able to enroll at least 30% of this patients group and complete enrollment in 1.5 years’ time.  Analysis and drafting of the manuscript will likely take an additional [ADDRESS_269219] of care while the early thyroid testing will be done utilizing mail-in kits for patients’ convenience.  
h. Statistical Considerations  
Outcomes:  
Primary endpoint: 
Incidence of overt hypothyroidism at [ADDRESS_269220] RAI (TSH > 3.0 mIU/L or fT4 < 0.8 ng/dL) 
Exploratory endpoints: 
 Quality of Life measured by [CONTACT_223713]- HRQL and the TSQ  at 8 weeks and 6 months  
 Development of GO at 6 months Safety Endpoints  New development/deterioration of symptoms of hyperthyroidism. 
Sample Size  
The sample size for this study is based on the incidence of hypothyroidism primary endpoint using an 
alpha=0.10 (two- sided), beta=0.10. The proportion s of participants that develop hypothyroidism in the  
placebo and experimental groups are assumed to be 60% and 20% , respectively . A sample size of 30  per 
group will provide 90% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of  40% using the 
two-sided Fisher's Exact test.  
 
Primary Endpoint Analysis: 
The difference in the incidence rates of hypothyroidism at 8 weeks will be tested using Fisher ’s exact test.   
Exploratory Endpoint Analysis : 
Change in quality of life is measured serial over the course of the study follow -up. Change from baseline 
will be assessed using a hierarchical linear model (“growth curve”). The primary parameter of interest from the model will be the treatment by [CONTACT_223714]. Time, for this study, will be a collection of 
indicator variables representing each assessment point. The incidence of GO will be tested using Fisher’s exact test.  
Safety Analysis:  
Frequency tables of adverse events by [CONTACT_223715]. The relative 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a serious, and at least potentially related, adverse event will be estimated along with 
the 90% confidence interval for relative risk.  
Additional Statistical Considerations  
The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention to treat principle. Efforts will be made 
to ascertain the incidence of hypothyroidism even in participants that are lost to follow up. In the event 
the data cannot be obtained, the primary a nalysis will assume these participants are positive for 
hypothyroidism. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted on the per protocol data set.   
Missing data for the primary endpoint is addressed through the intention to treat analysis. Missing data in 
explo ratory endpoints could occur. The analysis plan for the QOL endpoint include maximum likelihood 
estimation that allows for missing data, provided the data are missing at least missing at random.  
A P-value < 0.[ADDRESS_269221] the development of euthyroidism/hypothyroidism, to decide on the best levothyroxine dose and to adjust the ther apeutic 
sequence accordingly. We have allowed for a low recruiting percentage to avoid the possibility of extending the study beyond the planned funded time frame.  
j. Limitations  - There may be patients that will report increase/recurrence of hyperthyroid ism-like 
symptoms. Those cases are rare and in the literature early T4 therapy (started at 50 mcg daily 2 weeks after RAI) required discontinuation due to symptoms of thyrotoxicosis in only 7/314 patients (2.2%)
1,4. In 
that case we will decrease the dose of levothyroxine x [ADDRESS_269222] the medication 
will be discontinued. Beta-blockers will be used liberally at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
k. Regulatory aspects  – We have discussed extensively and consulted with the Office of Research 
Regulatory Support on the issue of applicability for  an IND application. The intention of the study is to 
treat with levothyroxine patients that are in the very early stages of developi[INVESTIGATOR_223706]. The timing of th e therapy is based on data that documents onset of hypothyroidism well before the usual 8-[ADDRESS_269223] proposed to start at a very conservative dose (25 mcg) which represents 25% 
of the median dose used in the therapy of hypothyroidism. This is quite safe a s mentioned above , with  
only 2.2% of patients required discontinuation of therapy in similar studies in Europe. In addition the patients will be evaluated [ADDRESS_269224] submitting an IND 
application.

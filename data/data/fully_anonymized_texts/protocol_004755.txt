The overall reason for the amendment: To avoid unnecessary pausing of vaccination for Data Monitoring 
Committee ( DMC )review of certain reactogenicity events, common to most vaccines.
Rationale: As vaccinations in general are expected to cause benign reactogenicity events ranging from Grade [ADDRESS_123718]-vaccination, it is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_111047], with full 
support of Protocol Safety Review Team  (PSRT )and DMC members, that it would make sense to concentrate the 
in-depth revie ws by [CONTACT_111107]-related Grade 3solicited advers e 
events ( AEs) as follows: DMC revi ew with immediate pause in case ≥[ADDRESS_123719] longer than 72 hours (Table 8; footnote 3) .In addition, redaction of Table 8 has

The overall reason for the amendment: A clear distinction has been made between single and double method sof 
contraception.
Rationale: Taking into a ccount the very high effectiveness of long -acting r eversible contraceptive methods; a single 
contraceptive method is deemed appropr iate when using these methods. A double method should be used for all 
other contraceptive methods. The text has been expanded with the necessary details, and a summary table has been 
added.
4.1Inclusion Criteria
Rationale: To account for values in peri-menstrual women, the blood urinalysis laboratory criterion for inclusion 
has been set from <1+ to <2+ for w omen.
4.1Inclusion Criteria
Rationale: Depending on local collection processes, some variations may exist in blood volumes that will be 
collected. Therefore, the specific daily blood volume for the safety laboratory tests has been removed from the 
protocol. How ever, indicative blood volumes are included in the Study Procedures Manual . Total approximate blood 
volume per visit is still to be respected.
TIME AND EVENTS SCHEDULE
Rationale: It is clarified that the restriction " the vaccine administrator should have no other study function related to 
safety, study data evaluation ,or recording of AEs"is limited to the study functions related to those subjects who 
received a study vaccine on that particular visit .

or placebo, or placebo only will be given at Weeks [ADDRESS_123727] a regimen 
for evaluation in future efficacy studies .
Study vaccines used in this study are Ad26.Mos.HIV, MVA -Mosaic and gp140 DP :
Ad26.Mos.HIV vaccine is made up of the following three drug substances in a 2:1:1 ratio:
 Ad26.Mos1.Env
 Ad26.Mos1.Gag -Pol
 Ad26.Mos2.Gag -Pol
MVA -Mosaic consists ofthe following two vaccine products supplied in separate vials and administered 
in a 1:1 ratio:
 MVA -Mosaic1 = MVA virus expressing Mosaic1 HIV-1 Gag, Pol ,and Env proteins
 MVA -Mosaic2 = MVA virus expressing Mosaic2 HIV-1 Gag, Pol ,and Env proteins
gp140 DP(HIV-1Clade C glycoprotein 140)contains recombinant trimeric gp140 , produced on a 
transformed PER.C6®cell line constructed to produce gp140 DP. In this study, gp140 DPwill be dosed 
with aluminum phosphate as adjuvant .
The safety of two injections of high (250 mcg) and low (50 mcg) doses of gp140 DPwill be established 
in a Phase 1 study prior to dosing with gp140 DP in the current study.

Exploratory Objectives
The expl oratory objectives are:
 To explore immune responses to the different vaccine regimens in mucosal secretions in a subset of 
subjects .
 To explore gene expression patterns between the different vaccine regimens .
 To explore neutralization antibodies against the Ad26 vector .
 To assess the social impact of participation in an HIV vaccine study for subjects via a social impact 
questionnaire .
 To explore durability of the vaccine regimen in the groups selected for the long-term extension 
phase .
Hypothesis
No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested. This study will evaluate whether aprime/boost vaccine 
regimen consisti ng of Ad26.Mos.HIV with or without gp140 protein plus aluminum phosphate adjuvant , 
or Ad26.Mos.HIV /MVA -Mosaic with or without gp140 protein plus aluminum phosphate adjuvant is 
safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic, providing broad, functional and durable humoral and cellular 
responses.
OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN
This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group, placebo -controlled, double -blind clinical study in 
healthy HIV -uninfected adult men and women . Subjects will be enrolled regardless of their baseline Ad26 
seropositivity , as data from Study IPCAVD003 suggest that there is little impact of baseline Ad26 
neutralizing antibodies (nAbs)on the immunogenicity of this Ad26 vaccine vector, at the titers observed 
in thatstudy, however regional differences are known to occur . Vaccinations areadministered as shown 
in Table 1.
The study comprises a maximum 4-week screening period, a 48-week vaccination period during which 
subjects will be vaccinated at baseline, Week 12 and Week 24, with a booster at Week 48, and a 48 -week 
follow -up period to the final visit at Week 96. Based on the analysis of the Week 28 data, aLong Term 
Extension ( LTE)phase (approximately 5 years after Week 96) will be performed for subjects randomized 
to Group 1 and Group 2and having received all 4 vaccinations . These 2 groups (including a gp140 
250mcg and a gp140 50 mcg dose, respectively) form the basis for th e regimens that will be evaluated in 
future studies . The end of the study will be the last subject’s last visit.

*An optional LTE phase (approximately 5 yearsafter Week 96 ) will be performed for subjects randomized to 
Group [ADDRESS_123728] 30 minutes for any reactogenicity. 
Subjects will use a memory aid to document any local and systemic adverse events (AEs) in the evening 
after each vaccination and then daily for the next 7days. The investigator or his/her designe e will 
document any AEsb, and will collect blood and urine samples for safety laboratory assessment 
(hematology, biochemistry , and urinalysis) at each visit until Week 96. Cardiac safety surveillance 
monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_53402] (ECG) and measurement of specific cardiac enzymes 
(troponin) if cardiac symptoms appear. Also, subjects will be specifically asked about cardiac symptoms 
at each post -vaccination visit.
Blood samples will be taken at specific clinic visits to assess immune respo nses.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and an internal Protocol Safety Review Team 
(PSRT), composed of medical and safety representatives of the sponsor and partners will be established 
for this study to evaluat e safety and tolerability data.
                                                
bAt the visits at 2 w eeks after each vaccination, t he investigator or his/her designee should discuss information from 
the memory aids with subjects, and complete the relevant parts of the CRF.

Approved , Date: 21 December 2016PSRT and DMC Review of Sentinel Groups
There will be a pause in enrollment after 10% of the target number of subjects have received their first 
injection (ie,approximately 40 subjects) . The PSRT will review the blinded Week [ADDRESS_123729] 
injection to determine if enrollment can continue. The PSRT will also review blinded safety data ( 2 weeks 
of follow up ) after 30% of subjects have received their first injection without a pause in enrollment .
To decide whether further dosing can continue, the DMC will review blinded safety data (2 weeks of 
follow up) after 30% of subjects have received their first injection, and unblinded data after 10% of 
subjects have received their third injection, and after 30% of subjects have received their third injectio n.
DMC Review of gp140 DP Safety in HIV -V-A003
The safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of gp140 DPwill be evaluated in a separate safety study 
(HIV -V-A003) with interim safety results available prior to the first subject reaching Week 24 of this 
study ,HIV-V-A004 (the time point at which subjects in certain arms will receiv e gp140 DP).The DMC 
will review the interim safety results of study HIV -V-A003 and will allow administration of the first dose 
of gp140 DP(third injection; Week 24 vaccination) in this HIV-V-A004 protocol only if no safety  
concerns are identified.
Analysis Timepoints
The primary analysis will be performed once all subjects have completed the Week 28visit (ie,[ADDRESS_123730] ion) or discontinued earlier. The purpose of this analysis is to allow for an early 
conclusion on regimen selection for future studies, based on immunogenicity and safety . An additional 
analysis will be performed once all subjects have completed the Week 52visit (ie,4 weeks after the 
fourth injection) or discontinued earlier. The final analysis of the main study will be performed once all 
subjects have completed their final study visit at Week 96 (ie,including the second year follow -up period)
or discont inued earlier. The final analysis of the LTE phase (optional and only for a subset of subjects) 
will be performed once all included subjects have completed the last visit of the extension period (Week 
336), or discontinued earlier .
SUBJECT POPULATION
Study subjects must behealthy (on the basis of physical examination, medical history, laboratory 
assessments , ECG and vital signs measurement performed at screening) HIV-uninfected adult men and 
women , aged ≥18 to ≤50 years on the day of signing the informed consent form (ICF), and assessed by 
[CONTACT_111109].
In total, 400 subjects will be randomized equally into one of seven prime/boost vaccine regimens, 
consisting of Ad26.Mos.HIV with or without gp140 protein (low or high dose), 
Ad26.Mos.HIV /MVA -Mosaic with or without gp140 protein (low or high dose) ,or placebo (Table 1).
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] ([LOCATION_002] [US], Africa, and Asia) . Efforts will be made to 
enroll a minimum of 5 0subjects per region.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Subjects will receive doses of study vaccine at four timepoints according to randomization, on Day 1, at 
Week 12, and at Week 24, with a booster at Week 48, administered by [CONTACT_111110] .For visits with only one injection (ie, at Week 0 and 12), either deltoid can be used. When 2 study 
vaccine injections are to be given at one visit (ie, at Week 24 and 48), it is required to use a different
deltoid for both injections . Exceptions are allowed only if medically indicated. Study vaccines are as 
follows :
 Ad26.Mos.HIV (Ad26.Mos.1.Env + Ad26.Mos1.Gag -Pol + Ad26.Mos2.Gag- Pol):

SAFETY EVALUATIONS
All AEs will be recorded from the time the informed consent is signed until the Week 96visit of 
the main study .During the optional LTE phase (Group 1 and 2), only SAEs (including HIV 
infection and abnormal pregnancy  outcome) will be recorded. 
On a daily basis, for [ADDRESS_123731] -vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days), subjects will 
be asked to record symptoms of the following AEs via amemory aid:
 Solicited local AEs: erythema ,induration and swelling (measured using the ruler supplied), and 
pain/tenderness, itching, or warmth at the injection sites.
 Solicited systemic AEs: fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, 
rashes, and general itching.
 Temperature should be measured at approximately the same time each day using the thermometer 
supplied. Fever will be recorded by [CONTACT_111111] 38.0°C.
 Other spontaneously reported AEs ( ie,unsolicited AEs) .
The investigator or his/her designee should discuss informat ion from the memory aids with subjects , 
document relevant information in the clinic chart (source document) and complete the relevant parts of 
the case report form (CRF) .

While mild to moderate vaccine reactions (local site and systemic responses) are expected, AEs that 
preclude further dose administration or more serious ones that would limit product development are not 
anticipated. With 50 individuals in a vaccine regimen, the observation of 0 such reactions would be 
associated with a 95% confidence that the true rate is less than 6%. For the combined groups with 
Ad26.Mos.HIV (n=350), there would be 95% confidence that the true rate is <1% when [ADDRESS_123738] one AE at given true AE rates:

The primary population for the safety analyses will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose
(Ad26.Mos.HIV or placebo).
The immunogenicity population will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose and have at 
least one measured post-dose blood sample collected. Anticipating a dropout rate of approximately 10%, 
45 evaluable subjects per group will allow detecti on of 2.3- fold differences in Env-binding antibody  
titers, generally accepted to be biologically relevant, between groups with 80% probability, assuming a 
two-sided 5% Type I error and a standard deviation of 0.6 on the log 10scale . 
Interim Safety Review
No formal interim analysis prior to the primary analysis at Week 28 is planned. The PSRT and DMC will 
review interim safety data.
An interim safety review by [CONTACT_111112] 2 safety data after 10% of subjects 
(approximately 40 subjects) have received their first injection at which time enrollment is paused . Based 
on the results of this analysis, a decision will be made whether enrollment can continue. The PSRT will 
also review blinded safety data (
2 weeks of follow up) after 30% of subjects have received their first 
injection without enrollment pause .

Immunogenicity Analysis
Since the correlate of protection for an HI V vaccine is unknown, regimen selection for future studies will 
be based on several immunogenicity assessments aiming at the regimen that elicits a well-balanced 
immune response as well as broad coverage of Clades A, B, and C. Emphasis will be on strength and 
breadth of Env antibody responses, as co-primary endpoints. In addition, functional antibody responses, 
nAbresponses as well as mappi[INVESTIGATOR_111055] (including V2 loop region) will be considered . 
Addition alconsideration will be given to responses to a comprehensive package of immunogenicity
testing including, but not limited to HIV nAb responses, functional antibody responses and cellular 
immune responses. This should be supported by [CONTACT_111113]8 IFNγ 
T-cells, CD4 T cells and functional antibodies.
Descriptive statistics (actual values and changes from reference) will be calculated for continuous 
immunologic parameters. Frequency tabulations will be calculated for discrete immunologic parameters. 
Graphical representations of changes in immunologic parameters will be made as applicable.
Safety Analyses
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be analyzed descriptively 
(including 95% confidence intervals).

Janssen Vaccines &Prevention B.V. is evaluating the potential of aproph ylactic Human 
Immunodeficiency  Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine comprising four candidate HIV-[ADDRESS_123748] regimens. These products are 
Ad26.Mos.HIVc, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA )-Mosaic1, MVA -Mosaic2, and glycoprotein 
[ADDRESS_123749] ( gp140 DP ).
Ad26.Mos.HIV vaccine is a recombinant replication -deficient Ad26 vectored vaccine and 
consists of three Ad26 vectors, one containing a mosaic insert of Env sequence, and two vectors 
containing mosaic inserts of Gag and Pol sequence s.
MVA -Mosaic is a recombinant live attenuated MVA virus -vectored vaccine that has been 
geneticall y engineered to express two mosaic Gag, Pol, and Env sequences (Mosaic 1 and 
Mosaic 2) optimized for maximal coverage of potential T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].
gp140 DP(HIV-1Clade C glycoprotein 140)contains recombinant trimeric gp140, produced on 
a transformed PER.C6®cell line constructed to produce gp140 DP. In this study , gp140 DPwill 
be dosed with aluminum phosphate as adjuvant.
Funding for the manufacture of the vaccine products came from the National Institute of Allergy  
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored Integrated Preclinical/Clinical AIDS Vaccine 
Development (IPCAVD) program, grants AI078526/ AI 096040.
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding Ad26.Mos.HIV ,

1.1. Background
A safe and effective HIV vaccine is the presently  elusive cornerstone of HIV prevention. 
Although the ideal vaccine would prevent infection of persons exposed to the virus, a vaccine 
might also attenuate infection once it has occurred. No presentl y available immunogen is able to 
induce efficient protection against HIV through neutralizing antibodies ( nAbs), the mechanism 
by [CONTACT_111115][INVESTIGATOR_111057]. The results of study  RV144, “the Thai

Approved , Date: 21 December 2016trial”, which evaluated a recombinant canary pox vector vaccine (ALVAC -HIV [vCP1521]) 
prime and a recombinant gp120 subunit vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E) boost, demonstrated 
approximately  30% protection from infection in the absence of either CD8 or nAb to primary 
HIV isolates5. A subsequent case -control anal ysis of RV144 revealed the following correlates of 
activity  of vaccines: high V1V2antibody  responses were associated with lower risk of HIV 
infection and high levels of anti-HIV-1 Env plasma immunoglobulin A (IgA)correlated with 
decreased vaccine efficacy  6,7. Optimally , both a robust CD4/CD8 T-cell response and a potent 
humoral response with multiple effectors would be induced b y a vaccine.
Recent data have shown that heterologous Ad26/MVA vaccine regimens containing Gag, Pol, 
and Env antigens can establish a per exposure risk reduction against acquisition of infection 
following repetitive, heterologous, intrarectal challenges with a neutralization -resistant virus 
(SIV MAC251) in rhesus monkey s 8. These data also demonstrated that the inclusion of Env 
sequences is required for protection, despi[INVESTIGATOR_111058] 18% difference in the Env amino- acid sequences 
between the vaccine and the challenge strains. Moreover, immunological correlates analyses 
suggest that Env- specifi c antibodies are critical for blocking acquisition of infection, whereas 
multiple cellular and humoral immune responses correlate with virological control, although the 
actual mechanisms of protection remain to be determined8.
Studies of HIV vaccine subjects and infected patients suggest that a successful HIV vaccine 
program will need to protect against the diverse strains and clades . Recently  published data 
demonstrate dthe capacity of bivalent HIV-1 mosaic antigens expressing Env, Gag, and Pol, as 
part of adenovirus/poxvirus and adenovirus/adenovirus vaccines, to protect rhesus monkey s 
against acquisition of SHIV-SF162P3 9. Improving the magnitude and breadth of epi[INVESTIGATOR_111059] a successful T-cell based preventive HIV 
vaccine. Published data from studies in non-human primates indicate that the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]-
specific responses induced by a  vaccine may be an important immune correlate of viral load 
control in the SI V challenge s ystem 10.
Strategies to accomplish this include the use ofvaccines containing immunogens from a number 
of prevalent clade s or using mosai c sequences, ie,proteins assembled from natural sequences by 
[CONTACT_111116], optimized for potential T-cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] 11. An objective of the HIV
vaccine development program being pursued by [CONTACT_111117] a 
vaccine candi date for improved potency , where potency  is defined as the quantitative response 
frequency  and amplitude, as well as the qualitative complexity  of the induced immune response. 
A second objective is to increase the breadth of response, defined as immune recognition of 
diverse strains of HIV to include multiple clade s and multiple genes. 
This study  proposes to evaluate the safet y/tolerability  and the immunogenicity  of vaccination 
with homologous Ad26.Mos.HIV regimens with high-dose gp140 DP/aluminum phosphate 
adjuvant, low-dose gp140 DP/aluminum phosphate adjuvant or no protein, as well as 
heterologous vector vaccine regimens with Ad26.Mos.HIV and MVA -Mosaic with high or 
low-dose gp140 DP /aluminum phosphate adjuvant or no protein.

Approved , Date: 21 December 2016Both Ad26 and MVA viral vectors with HIV deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA )inserts and HIV 
envelope proteins have been previously  studied in clinical studies with no important or 
unexpected safet y concerns. In three Phase 1 studies , Ad26.ENVA.01, at intramuscular (IM)
doses over the range 109to 1011viral particles (vp), was found to induce Env- specific humoral 
and cell-mediated responses when given on up to three occasions to more than [ADDRESS_123750] s. Ad26.ENVA.01 was generall y well-tolerated in these studies . An IMdose of 5x1010vp 
was found to provide the optimal balance of immunogenicity  and reactogenicity . Therefore, this 
is the dose of Ad26.Mos.HIV chosen to stud y further in this study .
In nine completed Phase 1/[ADDRESS_123751]
(Chiang Mai Double Recombinant) was found to be safe and immunogenic when given by  [CONTACT_111118] (ID)or IMroutes, either as a single agent, or when administered as a booster 
following appropriate priming3. At IMdoses of 107and 108pfu and IDdoses of 106and107pfu, 
MVA -CMDR was found to induce robust and durable humoral and cell-mediated immune 
responses when given on up to three occasions, with an IMdose of 108pfu being optimally  
immunogenic. Therefore, this is the dose of MVA with mosaic inserts to be studied in this study .
A monovalent gp120 protein (AIDSVAX B) was tested in [ADDRESS_123752] s. In RV144, the only vaccine study to 
date to demonstrate efficacy  inprevention of acquisition of HIV,a bivalent gp120 protein 
(AIDSVAX B/E) was used as a booster following a priming with a recombinant canary pox 
vector (ALVAC -HIV). The gp120 proteins were dosed at 300mcg. Therefore, a similar dose 
(250 mcg) of trimer icgp140 was chosen for evaluation in this study . Eviden ce exists indicating 
that there is no clear correlation between dose of envelope protein and antibody  response 12.For
this reason, a lower (50 mcg) dose of gp140 will also be tested.
In twoprevious HIV efficacy  studies utilizing Ad5 a trend towards increased HIV-1 infection 
was observed in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_111060] 13,14. The HVTN
502/Step ([COMPANY_006] Ad5) study  showed no efficacy  and a trend towards increased HIV -1 infections

the interim analy sis. More HIV-[ADDRESS_123754], but these

The mechanism for this possible increase in HIV-1 acquisition risk remains unclear, but a 
leading hypothesis involves activation of vector -specific CD4+ T lymphocy tes at mucosal

Approved , Date: 21 December 2016surfaces following Ad5 vaccination, potentially  resulting in increa sed targets for HIV-1 
infection15,16.
The rationale to continue clinical development of Ad26 vector -based vaccines for HIV -1 is based 
on data showing that: (1) Ad26 is biologically  substantially  different than Ad5; (2) Ad26 -based 
vaccines afford superior protective efficacy  compared with Ad5-based vaccines against 
SIVmac251 challenges in rhesus monkey s; and (3) Ad26 did not increase the number or 
activation status of total or vector -specific CD4+ T lymphocy tes at mucosal surfaces in humans 
following vaccination in a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical study
(IPCAVD -003).
In IPCAV D003, [ADDRESS_123755] s were randomized 3:1 to receive a single vaccination 
with Ad26.ENVA.01 or placebo. Eight of the subjects were Ad26 seropositive at enrollment. 
The T-cell responses by [CONTACT_111119]26 seroposi tive 
subjects, the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  
(ELISA)responses proved comparable between subjects who were Ad26 seropositive and Ad26 
seronegative at baseline, both in peripheral blood and in colorectal mucosa. In addition, sy stemic 
and mucosal responses persisted for at least [ADDRESS_123756]. Additionally , there 
were no consistent increases in Ad26 -specific CD4+ T-lymphocy te responses at mucosal 
surfaces following vaccination in either Ad26 seronegative or Ad26 seropositive subjects.
In this study  (HIV-V- A004), Ad26 with mosaic inserts will be used for the first time in a clinical 
study . It is not expecte d that the DNA insert will alter the safety  of the viral vector. However, a n 
internal Protocol Safet y Review Team (PSRT) and an independent data monitoring committee 
(DMC) will be established and pauses in enrollment, regular safet y reviews, and stringent 
vaccine/stud y pause rules will be included (see Section 11.9).
1.2. Overall Rationale for the Study
This study , first-in-human for Ad26.Mos.HIV ,will assess the safet y/tolerability  and 
immunogenicit y of seven prime/boost vaccine regimens . Ad26.Mos.HIV or placebo will be 
given at Weeks 0 and 12. Ad.26.Mos.HIV or MVA- Mosaic, both with or without gp140 DP (low 
or high dose), gp140 DP (high dose) or placebo ,or placebo only will be given at Weeks [ADDRESS_123757] a regimen for evaluation in future efficacy  studies .

respectivel y) form the basis for the regimens that will be evaluated in future studies.
After vaccination, subjects will remain under observation for at least 30minutes for any 
reactogenicity . Subjects will use a memory  aid to document local and systemic adverse events 
(AEs) in the evening after each vaccination and then daily  for the next 7days. The investigator 
or his/her designee will document any AEs in the case report form (CRF ), and will collect blood 
and urine samples for safety  laboratory  assessment (hematology , biochemistry , and urinaly sis) at 
each visit until Week 96. Cardiac safet y surveillance monitoring will be performed by 
[CONTACT_53402] (ECG) and measurement of specific cardiac enzymes (troponin) if cardiac 
symptoms appear. Also, subjects will be specifically  asked abou t cardiac symptoms at each 
post-vaccination visit.
Blood samples will be taken at specific clinic visit s to assess immune responses.
PSRT and DMC Review of Sentinel Groups
There will be a pause in enrollment after 10% of the target number of subjects have received 
their first injection (ie,approximately  40 subjects). The PSRT will review the blinded Week [ADDRESS_123758] injection to determine if enrollment can continue. The PSRT will also 
review blinded safety  data (2 weeks of follow up) after 30% of subjects have received their first 
injection without a pause in enrollment. See Section 11.9 on study  holding rules .
To decide whether further dosing can continue, the DMC will review blinded safet y data 
(2weeks of follow up) after 30% of subjec ts have received their first injection, and unblinded 
data after 10% of subjects have received their third injection, and after 30% of subjects have 
received their third vaccination .
DMC Review of gp140 DP Safety in HIV -V-A003
The safet y, tolerability  and immunogenicity  of gp140 DPwill be evaluated in a separate safet y 
study  (HIV-V- A003) with interim safet y results available prior to the first subject reaching 
Week 24 of this study , HIV-V- A004 (the time point at which subjects in certain arms will 
receive gp140 DP). The DMC will review the interim safet y results of study  HIV-V-A003 and 
will allow administration of the first dose of gp140 DP(third injection; Week 24 vaccination) in 
this HI V-V- A004 protocol only  if no safety  concerns are identified.

have also been reports, especiall y in patients with impaired renal function, of systemic 
accumulation of aluminum, which has been associated with nervous disorders and bone disease. 
Nonetheless, aluminum is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in food 
and water. Aluminum intake from vaccines is far less than that received from dietary  sources or 
medications such as antacids. Aluminium salts do not cause any serious or long-lasting adverse 
events 20,21.

5. VACCINE ALLOCA TION A ND BLIND ING
Study Vaccine Allocation
Procedures for Randomization 
Central randomization will be implemented in this study . Subjects will be randomly  assigned to 
one o f eight treatment groups based on a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared 
before the study  by [CONTACT_43754]. The randomization will be balanced 
by [CONTACT_111126] y permuted blocks and stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (US, Africa, and Asia) . Efforts will 
be made to enroll a minimum of 5 0subjects from each region.
The interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique treatment code, which will 
dictate the treatment assignment and matching study  vaccine for the subject. The requestor must 
use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when contact[CONTACT_111127], and will then give the relevant subject details to uniquely  identify  the subject.
Blinding
The subjects, clinical staff, and investigator, will be blinded to study  vaccine allocation until 
Week 96 . The sponsor will be blinded to study  vaccine allocation until the Week 28 analy sis (see 
Section 11.6). The pharmacist with primary  responsibil ity for vaccine dispensing will not be 
blinded to the study  vaccine.
A pharmacist will prepare study  vaccine for administration and will provide it to the clinic. In 
order to preserve blinding, he/she will place an overlay  on the syringes. Administration ofstudy 
vaccine to the subjects can be performed by [CONTACT_111128] 
(including the pharmacist who prepared the study  vaccine) who will have , on the day of 
administration, no other study  function related to safet y, study  data evaluation or recording of 
AEs for those subjects that he/she vaccinated on that day. More information and details on the 
preparation of vaccine and adjuvant components, as well as details on the holding time and 
storage conditions from the time of preparation to delivery  of the study  vaccine, are provided in 
Section 14.
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained
within the interactive web response system (IWRS), which has the functionality  to allow the 
investigator to break the blind for an individual subject.

Approved , Date: 21 December 2016Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until the Week 96 electronic Data 
Capture (eDC)database is finalized. By [CONTACT_111129] , clinical 
staff, the investigator and participating subjects will be partially  unblinded to their received 
treatment prior to full unblinding. Otherwise, the blind should be broken only if specific 
emergency  treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_35496]. In such cases, the investigator may in an emergency  determine the identity  of the 
treatment. It is recommended that the investigator contact [CONTACT_111130], before breaking the blind. Telephone contact [CONTACT_111131] 24hours per day, 7days per week. In the event the blind is 
broken, the spons or must be informed as soon as possible. The date and reason for the unblinding 
must be documented by [CONTACT_8784], in the appropriate section of the CRF, and in the source 
document. The documentation received from the IWRS indicating the code break must be 
retained with the subject’s source documents in a secure manner.
The sponsor , but not the investigator, will be unblinded at the time of the primary  analysis at 
Week 28.
6. DOSA GE A ND A DMINISTR ATION
Each subject will receive doses of study  vaccine at four timep oints according to randomization, 
on Day  1, at Week 12, and at Week 24, with a booster at Week 48, administered by  [CONTACT_111132] . For visits with only one injection (ie, at Week 0 and 12), either deltoid can be 
used. When 2 study  vaccine in jections are to be given at one visit (ie, at Week 24 and 48), it is 
required to use a different deltoid for both injections . Exceptions are allowed only if medically 
indicated.
For information on vaccination windows, see Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_123780] cannot be vaccinated 
within the allowed window ,then that vaccination should not be administered. However, if the 
window is missed due to a study  pause (see Section 11.9), vaccination will be assessed on a case 
by [CONTACT_413] , upon discussion between sponsor and investigator . If a subject misses more than 
1study  vaccination, he/she will be withdrawn from further study  vaccination (see Section 10.2).
Study  vaccines are as follows:
Ad26.Mos.HIV (Ad26.Mos.1.Env + Ad26.Mos1.Gag -Pol + Ad26.Mos2.G ag-Pol)

9.1. Study Procedures
9.1.1. Overview
Evaluation of the safety /tolerability of the vaccine regimens will include laboratory  assessments , 
physical assessment by [CONTACT_45914], and subject reports on signs and symptoms following 
vaccinations. Additional study  visits may be required if in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], further 
clinical or laboratory  evaluation is needed.
From screening to the final visit at Week 96, the total blood volume to be collected from each 
subject will be approximately  1271 mL.
The Time and Events Schedule summarizes the frequency  and timing of safet y and 
immunogenicit y measurements applicable to this study .
In case a grade 3 or grade 4 laboratory  abnormality , or any laboratory  abnormality  accompanied 
by [CONTACT_111133] y relevant signs or sy mptoms occurs (from the baseline visit onwards), a confirmatory 
test should be performed within [ADDRESS_123783] become available. After that, 
laboratory  tests will be repeated weekl y until values are resolved or stable.
9.1.2. Visit Windows
For the following visits, windows will be allowed as indicated:

*Ifa subject is not vaccinated on the given day of vaccination , the timings of visits at [ADDRESS_123784]-vaccination (see Time and Events Schedule) will be determined relative to the 
actual day of vaccination.
If a subject cannot be vaccinated within the allowed window ,then that vaccination should not be 
administered. However, if the window is missed due toa study  pause (see Section 11.9), 
vaccination will be assessed on a case by [CONTACT_111134] . If a subject misses more than 1 study vaccination, he/she will be withdrawn from 
further stud y vaccination .
9.1.3. Screening Phase (Weeks –4 to 0)
Only  healthy  subjects negative for HIV infection (if possible, the site should select an assay  that 
is US Food and Drug Administration [FDA ]-approved ) and comply ing with the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria specified in Section 4will be included into the study . The investigator will 
provide detailed information onthe study  to the subjects and will obtain written informed 
consent prior to each subject’s participation in the study . All the procedures described in the 
Time and Events Schedule will only  take place after written informed consent has been obtained.
Screening may  be conducted in part via a sponsor -and IRB /IEC-pre-approved non-study  specific
screening consent process, but only if these pre-screening procedures are identical to the per 
protocol scr eening tests and are within the 28- day window prior to firs t vaccination . However, no 
study  specific procedures, other than screening assessments, will be performed until the subject 
has signed the study -specific ICF. The non-study  specific ICF will be considered source data. 
During screening , subjects must pass the TOU, a questionnaire provided to the subject to 
document his/her understanding of the study  (see Section 16.1 and Attachment 3j). 
The following evaluations will be performed to determine eligibility  requirements as specified in 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria:
Physical examination including vital signs measurement
Medical history
Review of pre -study medications
HIV-risk assessment
Cardiac risk assessment
Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria

the final visit of the main study  (Week 96). At all other visits, an abbreviated, symptom -directed 
exam will be performed as indicated by [CONTACT_111141], 
clinically  relevant symptoms and medical history. Symptom -directed physical examination may 
be repeated if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093]. Weight will be measured at every  visit.
Physical examinations will be performed by [CONTACT_111142] y-trained 
clinician. Any screening or baseline abnormalit yshould be documented in the medical history  
page of the CRF. Any clinically  relevant post-baseline abnormality or any clinicall y relevant 
worsening versus baseline conditions should be documented in the AE pages of the CRF.
9.4. HIV Testing and VISP
9.4.1. HIV Testing
At screening, subjects will be tested for HIV infection, and must be negative to be entered into 
the study .If pos sible, the site should select an assay that is US FDA -approved .
After screening, diagnostic HIV testing will be performed during the study  as indicated in the 
Time and Events Schedule. An HIV testing algorithm (detailed in the Study Procedures Manual) 
willbe followed. Information provided to the clinical staff of the study site will not include the 
results of specific tests, but will state only the final interpretation as “infected” or “uninfected”. 
This system allows timely  HIV testing without compromising the double -blind nature of the

Approved , Date: 21 December 2016study . The algorithm used for HIV testing throughout the main phase of the study  aims to 
differentiate false -positive results (Vaccine Induced Seropositivity  [VISP]) from true positives 
(HIV infection). 
If a false -positive HIV test develops during the study , further HIV testing will be offered via 
post-study  follow up. (See Section 9.4.3 for more details on VI SP).
9.4.2. Management of Subjects who Become HIV -infected During the Study
Test results performed to confirm the diagnosis will be forwarded to the study  staff. Subjects 
who become HIV -infected during the study will (see Section 12.3.3 ):
be excluded from further vaccinations 
be provided counseling and referred for medical treatment
be informed about observational studies monitoring subject s with HIV infection
9.4.3. Vaccine Induced Seropositivity (VISP)
In general, HIV-uninfected subjects who participate in preventative HIV vaccine studies may 
develop HIV -specific antibodies as a result of an immune response to the candidate HIV vaccine, 
referred to as VISP. These antibodies may be detected in common HIV serologic tests, causing 
the test to appear positive even in the absence of actual HIV infection. VISP may become 
evident during the study , or after the study  has been completed.
Should a subject receive a positive result in an HIV antibody  test during the study , the site will 
carry out a follow -up testing algorithm either to exclude or confirm HIV infection. Further 
details of this algorithm are given in the Site Procedures Manual.
Subjects should not donat eblood during the study . Blood donation options for those subjects 
who wish to resume blood donation will be explained at the final stud y follow -up visit. 
In the case of VISP, if,either during the study  or after the end of the study, a subject requires an 
HIV test outside the study  (eg,to obtain a travel visa or insurance, or for medical reasons), 
he/she should contact [CONTACT_111143]. The center can issue a written statement giving details 
on VISP and on the testing algorithm to be followed. If requested by a subject , repeat HIV 
testing will be available at the site at most every  three months, to confirm their HIV -status. More 
frequent testing is only allowed after sponsor approval . Testing for a particular subject will be 
available as long as VI SP is present for this subject.
Depending on the local availability  of a follow -up protocol, subjects could join into such a study  
that specificall y follows the course of VISP.Such a study  may not be available at all sites.
However, if such a study  is not available, the site will provide HIV testing on request as 
described in the previous paragraph.
In addition to providing testing, subjects w illalway s receive pre -and post -test counseling.

impact could manifest in one or more way s, resulting in social conflicts and stigmatization:
1.The investigational vaccine is thought to be harmful to the subject ’s health, including a 
belief th at it might cause HIV infection.
2.The subject is perceived as HIV -infected or at high r isk.
3.Repercussions from an y VISP.
For these reasons, subjects will complete a social impact questionnaire at Weeks 24, [ADDRESS_123813]’s participation.
9.4.5. Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
In case a subject believes he/she might have been exposed to HIV, he/she should contact [CONTACT_111144]. Treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_111145], 
in accordance with local PEP guidelines. The sponsor should be informed as soon as possible. 
PEP medication will be reimbursed by [CONTACT_111146]. HIV prevention 
counseling will be provided. In case a subject hasrecurrent need for PEP, eligibility  of the 
subject (with regards to HIV -risk profile) to continue in the study  will be re -assessed.
9.5. Sample Collection and Handling
The actual dates of sample collection must be recorded in the CRF or laboratory  requisition 
form. Refer to the Time and Events Schedule for the timing and frequency  of all sample 
collections.
Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples for immunogenicity 
assay  are found in the Laboratory  Manual that will be provided. Collection, handling, storage,

If a subject is lost to follow up, every  reasonable effort must be made by  [CONTACT_43757]/withdrawa l. The measures 
taken for at least three efforts to follow up must be documented.
When a subject withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be 
documented in the CRF and in the source document. Study  vaccine assigned to the withdrawn 
subject may not be assigned to another subject. Enrollment will be stopped when [ADDRESS_123816] withdraws early  from the study , assessments 
for early  withdrawal should be obtained (see Section 9.1.7 ).
Subjects who wish to withdraw consent from participation in the study will be offered a single 
exit visit for safet y follow -up (prior to formal withdrawal of consent). They  have the right to 
refuse .The exit visit is only  appl icable to the main study  until W eek 96.
A subject who withdraws from the study  will have the following options regarding optional 
research samples:
The collected samples will be retained and used in accordance with the subject's original 
informed consent appendix for optional research samples.
The subject may withdraw conse nt for optional resear ch samples, in which case the samples
will be destroy ed and no further testing will take place. To initiate the sample destruction 
process, the investigator must notify  the sponsor study  site contact [CONTACT_111150]. If requested, the 
investigator will receive written confirmation from the sponsor that the samples have been 
destroy ed.
Withdrawal From the Optional Research Samples While Remaining in the Main Study
The subject may  withdraw consent for optional research samples while remaining in the study . In 
such a case, the optional research samples will be destroy ed. The sample destruction process will 
proceed as described above.
Withdrawal From the Use of Samples in Future Resea rch
The subject may withdraw consent for use of samples for future research (refer to 
Section 16.2.5 ). In such a case, samples will be destroy ed after they are no longer needed for the

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_123817] completed the Week 28visit (ie,
4weeks after the third injection) or discontinued earlier. The purpose of this analy sis is to allow 
for an early conclusion on regimen selection for future studies, based on immunogenicit y and 
safet y. An additional analy sis will be performed once all subjects have completed the Week 52 
visit (ie,4 weeks after the fourth injection) or discontinued earlier. The final analy sis of the main 
study  will be performed once all subjects have completed their final study visit at Week 96 (ie,
including the second yearfollow -up period) or discontinued earlier. The final analysis of the 
LTE phase (optional and only for a subset of subjects) will be performed once all included 
subjects have completed the last visit of the extension period (Week 336), or discontinued 
earlier.
11.1. Analysis Populations
The safet y population will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of study  vaccine, 
and for whom an y post -dose data is available.
The immunogenicit y population will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of 
study  vaccine, and who have data from at least one post -dose blood sample.
The per-protocol population will consist of all subjects who have received at least the first three 
vaccinations according to the protocol -specifie d vaccination schedule, have at least one 
measured post-dose blood sample collected, and who have no major protocol violations
impacting immunogenicity  assessments .
11.2. Sample Size Determination

While mild to moderate vaccine reactions (local injection site and systemic responses) are 
expected, AEs that preclude further dose administration or more serious ones that would limit 
product development are not anticipated. With 50 individuals in a vaccine regimen, the 
observation of 0 such reactions would be associated with a 95% confidence that the true rate is 
less than 6%. For the combined groups with Ad26.Mos.HIV (n=350), there would be 95% 
confidence that the true rate is <1% when [ADDRESS_123819] one AE at given true AE rates:

The primary  population for the safety  analyses will consist of all subjects who received at least 
one dose (Ad26.Mos.HIV or placebo).
The immunogenicit y population will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose and 
have at least one measured post-dose blood sample collected. Anticipating a dropout rate of 
approximately  10%, 45 evaluable subjects per group will allow detecti onof2.3-fold differences 
in Env- binding antibody titers, generall y accepted to be biologically  relevant, between groups 
with 80% probabilit y, assuming a two-sided 5% Type I error and a standard deviation of 0.6 on 
the log 10scale .
Groups will be combined to make comparisons between different viral vectors (groups combined 
over the different protein doses, N=135 per group) or between different protein doses (groups 
combined over different viral vectors, N=90 per group). Under the same assumptions as above, 
this will allow detection of 1.6-fold (N=135/group) to 1.8-fold differences (N=90/group) in Env-
binding antibody  titers. Potential statistical interactions will be explored by [CONTACT_111151].
Breadth of Env- binding antibody  response will be summarized as the number of HIV clade s 
(ranging 0-3, for Clade s A, B, C) to which a subject shows an antibody  response . Differences in 
breadth between different regimens will be compared via the Wilcoxon -Mann-Whitney test. 
Assuming 45 evaluable subjects per group, a two-sided 5% Type I error rate, no correlation 
between the different clade s, and a 90% response rate for every  clade (A/B/C) in one group, 
Table 7below shows the power to detect a significant difference with various alternative
breadths and (combined) group sizes.

For all subjects, demographic characteristics ( eg, age, height, weight, body  mass index [BMI], 
race, and gender), and other baseline characteristics ( eg,physical examination, medical history , 
concomitant diseases) will be tabulated and summarized with descriptive statistics.
11.4. Immunogenicity  Analyses
No formal hypothesis on immunogenicit y will be tested. The analysis of immunogenicity  will be 
done on the immunogenicity and per -protocol population s as defined in Section 11.1.
Descriptive statistics (actual values and changes from reference) will be calculated for 
continuous immunologic parameters at all time points. Graphical representations of changes in 
immunologic parameters will be made as applicable. Differences between groups at a specific 
time point will be tested for exploratory  purposes by a 2-sample t-test if the data appear to be 
normally  distributed. If not, the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used. If portions 
of the measu rements are censored below the assay  quantification limit, the Gehan -Wilcoxon test 
will be employ ed. All statistical tests will be two-sided and will be considered statistically 
significant if p<0.05.
Frequency  tabulations will be calculated for discrete ( qualitative) immunologic parameters at all 
time points. Significant differences between groups will be determined by a  2-sided Fisher’s 
exact test. 
Magnitude and breadth of (neutralizing) antibody  responses will be explored graphicall y through 
the generat ion of individual magnitude -breadth (M-B) curves. The area under the M-B curve 
(AUC) provides an overall summary  of the M-B profile. The AUCs will be compared between 
groups using the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney  test.

of study  vaccine.
Adverse Events and Reactoge nicity
The verbatim terms used in the CRF by [CONTACT_111152] (MedDRA). All reported AEs (local and systemic, 
solicited and unsolicited) with onset during the treatment period (ie,treatment -emergent AEs, 
and AEs that have worsened since baseline) will be included in the analy sis. For each AE, the 
number and percentage of subjects who experience at least one occurrence of the given event 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_19313], including exact 95% confidence intervals. Summaries, listings, 
datasets, or subject narratives may be provided, as appropriate, for those subjects who die, who 
discontinue vaccinations due to an AE, or who experience a severe AE or an SAE. The analy sis 
for solicited A Es will be done on those subjects in the safety  population for whom reactogenicity 
assessments are available in the database. The analy sis of unsolicited AEs will be done based on 
the safety population.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Laboratory  data will be summarized by [CONTACT_23821]. Descriptive statistics (actual 
values and changes from reference) will be calculated for each laboratory  analyte at baseline and 
at each scheduled time point. Graphical presentation of changes in laboratory  tests will bemade 
as applicable. Baseline refers to the pre-dose value on Day 1. If this value is not available, the 
value at screening will be used as baseline value. Laboratory abnormalities will be determined 
according to a modified version of the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severit y of Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Version 1.0 dated December 2004 
(Clarification, August 2009) included in Attachment 1,and in accordance with the normal ranges 
of the clinical laboratory . Laboratory  abnormalities will be tabulated per treatment group.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
All statistical analy ses of ECG variables will use the centralized ECG over- read data.
The effects on cardiovascular variables will be evaluated by [CONTACT_23822].
Vital Signs
Descriptive statistics ofpulse rate and blood pressure (systolic anddiastolic) values and changes 
from baseline will be summarized at each scheduled time point. The percentage of subjects with

11.6. Interim A nalysis
Interim safety  data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_111153] (see Section 11.7) and the DMC (See 
Section 11.8)
No formal interim analy sis is planned prior to the primary  analysis. The primary  analysis will be 
performed once all subjects have completed the Week 28visit (ie,[ADDRESS_123823] 
injection) or discontinued earlier. The purpose of this analy sis is to allow for an early conclusion 
on regimen selection for future studies , based on immunogenicit y and safet y. An additional 
analysis will be performed once all subjects have completed the Week 52 visit (ie,4 weeks after 
the fourth injection) or discontinued earlier. The final analy sisof the main study will be 
performed once all subjects have completed their final study visit at Week 96 (ie,including the 
second year follow -up period) or discontinued earlier. The final analy sis of the LTE phase 
(optional and only for a subset of subjects) will be performed once all included subjects have 
completed the last visit of the extension period (Week 336), or discontinued earlier.
11.7. Protocol Safety  Rev iew Team (PSRT)
The internal PSRT will review all AEs on a regular basis as needed. The PSRT will also review 
safet y data reports on a regular basis until the last subject has completed the Week 52 visit, and 
thereafter as needed. In addition to regular reviews of safety  information, the PSRT will perform 
a cumulative review of blinded safet y data.
The PSRT will review safe ty data at two specific timepoints to ensure the safet y of the subjects :
Following a pause in enrollment after 10% of the target number of subjects have received 
their first injection, the PSRT will review blinded Week 2 safety  data of these subjects to 
determine if enrollment can continue.
Review blinded safet y data (2 weeks of follow up) after 30% of subjects have received their 
first injection (without enrollment pause) .
The occurrence of any  AE/SAE leading to a study holding situation may  trigger a DMC meeting 
as outlined inSection 11.9, and the PSRT will decide by [CONTACT_111154]/SAE 
should also be reviewed by [CONTACT_1363] . As per Section 11.9, any AE/SAE will be handled as

The PSRT will include, but will not be limited to, medical and safety  representatives from the 
sponsor, site ,DAIDS and BIDMC.
11.8. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
An independent DMC will be appointed by [CONTACT_111155]. The DMC may review an individual SAE or it may choose to 
review AEs, SAEs, and laboratory  and vital sign data. The conclusions of the DMC will be 
communicated to the investigators and the IRB/IEC and the national regulatory  authorities as 
appropriate. The sponsor agrees to abide by [CONTACT_111156], the IRBsor IECs.
In general, the DMC may unblind any amount of safet y information needed to conduct their 
assessment .
The DMC will review safety  data at three specific timepoints to ensure the safet y of the subjects :
Review blinded safet y data (2 weeks of follow up) after 30% of subjects have received their 
first injection to decide whether further dosing can continue;
Review unblinded safet y data (2 weeks of follow up) after 10% of subjects have received 
their third injection to decide wheth er further dosing can continue;
Review unblinded safet y data (2 weeks of follow up) after 30% of subjects have received 
their third injection to decide whether further dosing can continue.
The occurrence of any  AE/SAE leading to a study holding situation may trigger a DMC meeting , 
as outlined in Section 11.[ADDRESS_123824] 
one statistician. The DMC responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in its 
charter.
11.9. Study Holding Rules
If a dose of vaccine is considered, by [CONTACT_111157], to raise significant safet y concerns, all 
enrollment and vaccinations will be suspended until recommendations areissued . The AEs that 
may lead to a safet y pause or prompt PSRT AE review are summarized below inTable 8.These 
study  holding rules apply  to AEs/SAEs occurring up to [ADDRESS_123825] vaccination.
Related AEs are defined as AEs deemed to be very likely, probabl y, or possibly related to study  
vaccine; not related AEs are defined as AEs deemed to be doubtful or not related to the study 
vaccine.

Vaccinations for an individual subject may be suspended for safety  concerns other than those 
described in the table, at the discretion of the investigator if he/she feels the subject’s safety  may  
be threatened. The investigator may ask for a PSRT meeting to be held for any single event or 
combination of multiple events which, in his/her professional opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], jeopardize the safet y of 
the subjects or the reliability  of the data.
Vaccinations for the study  may be suspended for safety  concerns other than those described in 
the table, or before pause rules are met, pending DMC review, if, in the judgment of the PSRT, 
subject safet y ma y be threatened.
For events in the table above, the investigator notifies the sponsor’s study responsible physician 
(or designee) immediately , and in all cases within [ADDRESS_123828] after the site observes, or 
is notified of, the AE, and the study  responsible phy sician (or contact[CONTACT_111159]’s representative) 
then notifies the PSRT immediately . If the case(s) is (are) deemed to fulfill the potential holding 
rules, as specified inTable 8, the PSRT will convene within one business day to review these 
AEs. The PSRT will review and determine disposition ,including whether the DMC needs to 
review the event (s).

12. ADVERSE EVENT REPOR TING
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety  information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by 
[CONTACT_23824]. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in 
conformity  with regulatory  requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y 
information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_111163] s.
12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a medicinal 
(investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily  have a cau sal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per International 
Conference on Harmonisation [I CH].)
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects AEs starting with the signing of the ICF to the final visit of the main 
study (Week 96).During the optional L TE phase (Group 1 an d 2), onl y SAEs will be recorded.
Serious Adverse Event
An SAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use is an y untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose:
Results in death
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
JNJ-55471468, JNJ -55471494, JNJ -55471520, JNJ -55471533, JNJ -55471572, JNJ55471585
Clinical Protocol HIV-V-A004 Amendment 5
69
Approved , Date: 21 December 2016Is life -threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or signif icant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is Medicall y Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738]. 
These should usually  be considered serious.
Confirmed HIV  infection in a subject during the study  is considered an SAE (see Section 12.3.3 ).
A suspected transmission of any  infectious agent via a medicinal product is alway s considered as 
an important medical event, ie,an SAE.
If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the study  vaccine and the event ( eg,death from anaphy laxis), the event will 
be reported as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) by [CONTACT_111164]/IEC according to regulatory  and local 
requirements.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with the applicable 
product reference safet y information. For Ad26.Mos.HIV, MVA -Mosaic and gp140 DP, the 
expectedness of an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_111165]’s Brochure s 2-4.
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of Study Vaccine
An AE is considered associated with study  vaccine if the attribution is possibly , probabl y, or 
very likely related b y the definitions listed in Section 12.1.2 .
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Every  effort should be made by  [CONTACT_111166], ie,to administration of the study  vaccine or to alternative causes ( eg,natural history  
of the underl ying diseases, concomitant therap y). This applies to all AEs, whether serious or 
non-serious.

70
Approved , Date: 21 December 2016The investigator will use the following guidelines to assess the causal relationship of an AE to 
study  vaccine:
Not related: An AE that is not related to the use of study  vaccine .
Doubtful ly 
related :An AE for which an alternative explanation is more likely , eg,
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time 
suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely .
Possibl y related : An AE that might be due to the use of study  vaccine. An alternative 
explanation, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is 
inconclusive. The relationship in tim e is reasonable; therefore, the causal 
relationship cannot be excluded.
Probabl y related :An AE that might be due to the use of study  vaccine. The relationship in 
time is suggestive (eg,confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative 
explanation is less likely , eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant 
disease(s) .
Very likely
related :An AE that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be 
reasonabl y explained by [CONTACT_111167], eg,concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very 
suggestive ( eg,it is confirmed by  [CONTACT_35719]) .
Related AEs are defined as AEs deemed to be very likely, probabl y, or possibly related to study  
vaccine ; not related AEs are defined as AEs deemed to be doubtful or not related to the study 
vaccine.
12.1.3. Severity Criteria
All AE and laboratory  data will be coded for severity  using a modified version of the DAIDS 
Table for Grading the Severit y of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading 
Table), Version 1.0 dated December 2004 (Clarification, August 2009) included in 
Attachment 1.
For AEs not identified in the grading table (eg,diagnosis of HIV infection), the following 
guidelines will be applied:
Mild Grade 1 Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual 
social and functional activities
Moderate Grade 2 Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with 
usual social and functional activities
Severe Grade 3 Symptoms causing inability  to perform usual social and 
functional activities

Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a sponsor study  vaccine
Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to 
the sponsor study  vaccine, eg,name [CONTACT_2976])
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF. Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of an SAE should be recorded on the SAE page of the CRF.
12.3. Procedures
12.3.1. All Adverse Events
All AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from 
the time a s igned and dated ICF is obtained until completion of the subject’ s last procedure of the 
main study  (which may include contact [CONTACT_20687] -up of safet y).During the optional LTE phase 
(Group 1 and 2), only  SAEs will be recorded.
All SAEs, must be reported to the sponsor during the entire study  period (including the optional 
LTE phase for Group 1 and 2) using the SAE Form. Suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are reported even after the study is over , if the sponsor , DMC or investigator 
becomes aware of them. The sponsor will evaluate any safet y information that is spontaneously 
reported b y the investigator bey ond the time frame specified in the protocol.
The investigator will monitor and anal yze stud y data including all AE and lab orator ydata as they 
become available and will make determinations regarding the severity  of the adverse experiences 
and their relation to study  vaccine. AEs will be deemed either related to study  vaccine or not 
related to study  vaccine, according to Section 12.1.[ADDRESS_123830]-injection reactogenicity  (PIR) includes solicited AEs related to study  vaccine and therefore 
must be reported as such. The investigator or designee must review both PIR and other AE CRFs

document and reported ac cording to sponsor instructions.
The sponsor assumes responsibility  for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory  authorities. 
The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute 
where required) all S[LOCATION_003]Rs. The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report S[LOCATION_003]Rs
to the appropriate I EC/IRB that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented 
by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB . A S[LOCATION_003]R will be reported to regulatory  authorities unblinded. Participating 
inves tigators and IEC/I RB will receive a blinded S[LOCATION_003]R summary , unless otherwise specified.
Subjects will be provided with a “wallet ( study )card” and instructed to carry  this card with them 
for the duration of the study  indicating the following:

16. ETHICA L ASPECTS
16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations
Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study  and, during the 
study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue 
participation. They  will be told that their consent to participate in the study  is voluntary  and may  be 
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they 
would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and 
potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled.
The total blood volume drawn from each subject will not exceed the US Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), and US FDA 
guidelines of [ADDRESS_123840]’s understanding of key aspects of the study . The 
test will help the study  staff to determine how well subjects understand the study  and their 
requirements for participation.
The TOU must be completed by [CONTACT_35668], prior to enrollment in the study . The TOU is 
reviewed one-on -one with the subjects and a member of the study  team. Subjects are allowed to 
retake the test as many times as necessary  to achieve the passing score ( ≥90%) required for 
participation in the study. If a subje ct fails to achieve the passing score, further information and 
counseling will be provided by  [CONTACT_111174]. 
Any subject not capable of understanding the key  aspects of the study , and their requirements for 
participation, should not be enrolled.
Risks Related to Vaccines
Subjects may  exhibit general signs and sy mptoms associated with administration of a vaccine, or 
vaccination with placebo, including fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, 
dizziness and fatigue. These side effects will be monitored, but are generally  short-term and do 
not require treatment.
Subjects may have an allergic reaction to the vaccination. An allergic reaction may cause a rash, 
hives or even difficult y breathing. Severe reactions are rare. Medications must beavailable in the 
clinic to treat serious allergic reactions.
The effect of this vaccine on a fetus or nursing baby  [CONTACT_111175], as well as the effect on semen, 
so female subjects of child bearing potential, and male subjects having sexual intercourse with 
females, will be required to agree to use birth control for sexual intercourse beginning prior to

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_123841] vaccination . Women who are pregnant or 
nursing will be excluded from the study .
Risks related to V ISP are discussed in Section 9.4.3 .
Risk of Myo/Pericarditis
The MVA vaccine used in this study  is related to the vaccine to prevent smallpox. A very small 
number of people who received the smallpox vaccine developed myocarditis or pericarditis. The 
number of people who had these problems was very small (96 people out of >650,000 who 
received the vaccine)18. These side effects are not expected from the MVA vaccine because it is
an attenuated virus and it cannot replicate. Myocarditis has not been reported with previous 
MVA use and has not been seen in Phase I/II clinical studies cited in this protocol. Subjects will 
be actively  screened to exclude pre-existing cardiac concerns and followed-up for symptoms 
related to cardiac complications. The management of subjects who develop cardiac symptoms is 
detailed in Section 9.3.2 .
Risks from Blood Draws
Blood drawing may cause pain, bruising, and, rarel y, infection at thesite where the blood is 
taken.
Risks from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Testing
Tests results can be used to provide information about how susceptible subjects are to certain 
diseases. Used inappropriately , this information could be discriminatory (for example, by 
[CONTACT_111176]). HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_111076]. However, the blood 
samples donated will not be used for this purpose; they will be used only to provide study 
investigators information about the immune system. The results will be coded to protect subject 
identity .
Unknown Risks
There may  be other ser ious risks that are not known.
Participants may believe that this vaccine provides protection against acquiring HIV infection, 
and therefore practice riskier behavior. They  will receive extensive counseling throughout the 
study  to address this potential pr oblem. It is not known if the study  vaccines increase or decrease 
the chance of becoming HIV infected when exposed, or if upon becoming HIV infected, the 
person’s disease course progresses faster or slower to AIDS.
Potential Benefits
There is no direct medical benefit to the subject for participation in this clinical study . Although 
study  subjects may benefit from clinical testing and physical examination, they may receive no 
direct benefit from participation. Others may benefit from knowledge gained in thi s study  that 
may aid in the development of an HIV vaccine.

17.6. Data Quality  Assurance/Quality  Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  sites, review of protocol procedures with t he investigator and 
study -site personnel before the study , and periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456]. Written 
instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples. 
Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -site personnel before 
the start of the study . The sponsor will review CRFs for accuracy  and completeness during 
on-site monitoring visits and after transmission to the sponsor; any  discrepancies will be resolved 
with the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database 
they will be verified for accuracy  and consistency  with the data sources.
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain allCRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained .
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custody  must be transferred to a person who will

If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regula tory authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator/institution must permit access to such 
reports.
17.8. Monitoring
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of the visits in a study  site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post-
initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the 
monitor will compare the data entered into the CRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] (source 
documents). The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all 
sources of original data required to complete the CRF are known to the sponsor and study -site 
personnel and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786] -site contact. If electronic 
records are maintained at the study  site, the method of verification must be discussed with the 
study -site personnel. 
Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for thepurpose of 
verify ing that the data recorded in the CRF are consistent with the original source data. Findings 
from this review of CRFs and source documents will be discussed with the study -site personnel. 
The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits , the relevant study -site personnel will be 
available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be 
provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a 
regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during 
these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to be provide an update on the 
progress of the st udy at the site.
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion
The study  is considered completed with the last visit for the last subject participating in the 
study . The final data from the study  site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after complet ion 
of the final subject visit at that study  site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement.
17.9.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study  site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study  sites will be closed upon study  completion. A 
study  site is considered closed when all required documents and study  supplies have been 
collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.

and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of a study  site by [CONTACT_11004]:
Failure of the investigator to comply  with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/I RB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines
Inadequate recruitment of subjects by  [CONTACT_093]
Discontinuation of further study  vaccine developm ent
17.10. On-Site A udits
Representatives of the sponsor’s clinical quality  assurance department may visit the study  site at 
any time during or after completion of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance 
with regulatory  guidelines and company  policy. These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection and comparison with the CRFs. Subject 
privacy  must, however, be respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible 
for being present and available for consultation during routinely  scheduled study -site audit visits 
conducted b y the sponsor or its designees. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_23865], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor if he or she has 
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  concerning an upcoming inspection.

Division of AIDS table for grading the severity of 
ADULT AND PEDIATRIC adverse Events
Version 1.0, December, 2004; clarification AUGUST 2009
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events 
(“DAIDS AE Grading Table”) is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for Adverse 
Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term.
This clarification of the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric AE’s 
provides additional explanation of the DAIDS AE Grading Table and clarifies some of the 
parameters. 
I. Instructions and Clarifications
Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs
The DAIDS AE Grading Table includes parameters for grading both Adult and Pediatric AEs.
When a single set of parameters is not appropriate for grading specific types of AEs for both 
Adult and Pediatric populations, separate sets of parameters for Adult and/or Pediatric 
populations (with specified respective age r anges) are given in the Table. If there is no 
distinction in the Table between Adult and Pediatric values for a type of AE, then the single set 
of parameters listed is to be used for grading the severity of both Adult and Pediatric events of 
that type.
Note: In the classification of adverse events, the term “severe” is notthe same as 
“serious.” Severity is an indication of the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe chest pain). The term “serious” relates to a participant/event 
outcome or action criteria , usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
participant’s life or functioning. 
Addenda [ADDRESS_123856], male genital 
area or rectum, strong consideration should be given to using Appendices I -III as the primary 
grading scales for these areas. The protocol would need to specifically state that one or more of 
the Appendices would be primary (and thus take precedence over the main Grading Table) for 
items that are listed in both the Appendix and the main Grading Table.
Addendum 1 -Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies -PDF
Addendum 2 -Male Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies -PDF
Addendum 3 -Rectal Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies -PDF
Grade 5
For any AE where the outcome is death, the severity of the AE is classified as Grade 5. 
Estimating Severity Grade for Parameters Not Identified in the Table
In order to grade a clinical AE that is notidentified in the DAIDS AE grading table, use the 
category “Estimating Severity Grade” located o n top of the table on Page 96.
Determining Severity Grade for Parameters “Between Grades”
If the severity of a clinical AE could fall under either one of two grades ( eg, the severity of an AE 
could be either Grade 2 or Grade 3), select the higher of the two grades for the AE. If a 
laboratory value that is graded as a multiple of the ULN or LLN falls between two grades, select

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_123857] (which is between the two grades), the 
severity of this AE would be Grade 2, the higher of the two grades.
Values Below Grade [ADDRESS_123858].
For example: Phosphate, Serum, Low, Adult and Pediatric > 14 years (Page 20) Grade 1 range 
is 2.50 mg/dL -< LLN. A particular laboratory’s normal range for Phosphate is 2.1 –3.8 mg/dL.
A participant’s actual lab value is 2.5. In this case, the value of 2.[ADDRESS_123859] for the local 
lab, but will be graded as Grade 1 per DAIDS AE Grading Table.
II. Definitions of terms used in the Table:
Basic Self -care Functions Adult
Activities such as bathing, dressing, toileting, transfer/movement, 
continence, and feeding.
Young Children
Activities that are age and culturally appropriate ( eg,feeding self with 
culturally appropriate eating implement).
LLN Lower limit of normal
Medical Inte rvention Use of pharmacologic or biologic agent(s) for treatment of an AE.
NA Not Applicable
Operative Intervention Surgical OR other invasive mechanical procedures.
ULN Upper limit of normal
Usual Social and Functional 
ActivitiesAdult
Adaptive tasks and desirable activities, such as going to work, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cooking, use of transportation, pursuing a hobby, etc.
Young Children
Activities that are age and culturally appropriate ( eg, social 
interactions, play activities, learning tasks, etc.).

The following are intended as guidelines for the investigator to help identify  potential vaccine

countries, in addition to minimum requirements specified by [CONTACT_111196] 
(“Have oral, vaginal or anal intercourse with an HIV-infected partner, or a partner who uses

HVTN Low Risk Guidelines
August 1, 2013
The following are intended as guidelines fo r the investigator to help identify  potential vaccine 
trial participants at “low risk” for HIV infection in the US and Switzerland. These guidelines are 
based on behaviors within the last 6 -12 months prior to enrollment; however, it may  be 
appropriate to consider a person’s behavior over a longer period of time than specified to assess 
the person’s likelihood of maintaining low risk behavior. Some volunteers may not be 
appropriate for enrollment even if they meet these guidelines. These guidelines should be
supplemented and interpreted with local epi[INVESTIGATOR_111104]. The investigator may  review the risk level of any volunteer 
with the site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Protocol Safet y Review Team.
A volunteer ma y be appropriate for inclusion if he/she meets these guidelines:
1. SEXUAL BEHAVIORS
In the last 12 months did not:
Have oral, vaginal or anal intercourse with an HIV -infected partner, or a partner who uses 
injection drugs
Give or receive money , drugs, gifts or services in exchange for oral, vaginal or anal sex
AND
In the last 6 months has abstained from penile/anal or penile/vaginal intercourse, OR
In the last 6 months :
Had 4 or fewer partners of the opposite birth sex for vaginal and/or anal intercours e, OR
Is an MSM (person born male with partner(s) born male) who, in the last 12 months :
Had 2 or fewer MSM partners for anal intercourse and had no unprotected anal sex with

Approved , Date: 21 December 2016partners). If the monogamous relationship ended, the volunteer may then have had 
protected anal intercourse with 1 other MSM partner (total [ADDRESS_123889] 
12 months).
Is a transgender person, regardless of the point on the transition spectrum, having sex with men 
(born male) and/or other transgender persons, who in the last 12 months :
Had 2 or fewer partners for anal or vaginal intercourse, and had no unprotected anal or 
vaginal sex, OR
Had unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse sex with [ADDRESS_123890] 12 months (during which neither partner had 
any other partners). If the monogamous relationship ended, may then have had protected 
anal or vaginal sex with 1 other partner (total [ADDRESS_123891] 12 months).
AND
Uses or intends to use condoms in situations which may  include penile/anal or penile/vaginal 
intercourse with new partners of unknow n HIV status, occasional partners, partners outside a 
primary  relationship, and/or partners known to have other partners.
2. NON- SEXUAL BEHAVIORS
In the last 12 months did not:
Inject drugs or other substances without a prescription
Use cocaine, methamphetamine, or excessive alcohol, which in the investigator’s 
judgment, rendered the participant at greater than low risk for acquiring HIV infection.
The investigator’s judgment should consider local epi[INVESTIGATOR_111105].
A volunteer is NOT appropriate for inclusion if he/she:
Acquired an STI ( ie, new infection) in the last 12 months:
Syphilis
Gonorrhea
Non-gonococcal urethritis

resumed.
aAt each contact, participants will be interviewed to collect safety data. Key endpoint 
assessments should be performed if required and as feasible. Participants will also be questioned regarding general health status to fulfill any physical examination requirement. Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol-specified assessments. Modifications to protocol-required assessments may be permitted via COVID-19 Appendix after consultation with the participant, investigator, and the sponsor. Missed assessments/visits will be captured in the clinical trial management system for protocol deviations. Discontinuations of study interventions and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID-19-related” in the case report form (CRF). Any deviations to study procedures occurring due to the COVID-19 pandemic need to be properly captured in the clinical trial management system (or CRF), with the prefix “COVID-19-related” (including actual visit date) and will be summarized in the clinical study report.The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the clinical study, and any changes will be communicated to the sites and to the health authorities according to applicableguidance documents and regulations. Modifications  made to the study conduct as a result of the 
COVID-[ADDRESS_123894] in-person physical presence between the participant 
and the qualified site staff (telephone or video call).
A home visit is defined as a visit during which the participant and the qualified site staff are both present at the 
participants’ home.

Status: Approved,  Date: [ADDRESS_123895] as soon as feasible and in accordance with local guidance and regulations and in agreement with the institutions and the investigator’s assessment of the safety of site staff and study participants.Study Visits and Assessments: !When site visits are not possible, sites should collect the assessments via remote visits, or via home visits (if possible and if the participant allows and provides consent to it). The actual visit date and the type of visit (i.e., remote or home visit) should be captured in the eCRF according to the eCRF completion guidelines. 
!Procedures that can’t be performed in case of remote visits (e.g., blood sampling for immunogenicity and HIV testing), should be documented as protocol deviations and labelled as “missed due to COVID-19”. The protocol deviations need to be captured in the source document.
Informed Consent!Consenting and re-consenting of participants for the measures taken (including also remote consenting by [CONTACT_111199]) will be performed as applicable and according to local guidance for informed consent applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The process is to be documented in the source documents. 
Source Data Verification/Monitoring!In case on-site monitoring visits are not possible, the site monitor may contact [CONTACT_111200] (in accordance with site and local requirements). Additional on-site monitoring visits may be needed in the future to catch up on source data verification. 
Site Audits!During the COVID-[ADDRESS_123896]/engagement from the investigator and study site personnel may not be conducted in order to comply with national, local, and/or organizational social distancing restrictions. Additional quality assurance activities such as remote audits or focused review of study related documents may take place with limited impact/engagement if possible.

Public  study title: Chronic Pain Risk Associated with Menstrual P eriod Pain 
A. Specific Aim s and Hypotheses:  
Endometrial shedding during the menstrual cycle elicits profound changes in neuronal activity 
and cytokines producing moderate to severe pelvic pain in more than 20% of reproductive- age 
women.1 Among these women, one out of every five develops chronic pelvic pain ( CPP) . In 
contrast, women without dysmenorrhea rarely develop CPP. Furthermore, half of women reporting moderate -severe dysmenorrhea exhibit bladder pain at innocuous levels of bladder 
filling.
[ADDRESS_485710] also shown that dysmenorrhea is a leading correlate of severe non-menstrual 
pelvic pain independent of psychological factors.3 Identifying the mechanism responsible for the 
transition from dysmenorrhea to CPP could allow the development of preventative strategies. 
We hypothesize the mechanism by [CONTACT_387629]- organ 
sensitization ( COS) . The uterine inflammation during menstruation likely contributes to CPP by 
[CONTACT_387630].4 This COS has been demonstrated with 
experimental injury and infection in animal models.5,6 Our prior findings discussed above2,3 
motivate our present central hypothesis: dysmenorrhea produces CPP via repetitive COS 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Although COS is believed to play a role in CPP, other studies of visceral pain7,[ADDRESS_485711] 
shown increases in visceral sensitivity involve impairments in descending inhibition, the normal 
counterbalancing outflow to pain-processing spi[INVESTIGATOR_387604].10 Also, since β-
estradiol (E2) is elevated in dysmenorrhea11–14, and increased E2 can worsen pain 
sensitivity15,16, alterations in E2 could also contribute to increased prevalence of CPP in women 
with dysmenorrhea. A major limitation of prior studies is that they do not address the relationship between COS and impairments to descending inhibition. They also do not consider 
important covariates such as E2 levels and psychological factors (e.g., anxiety/depression).
17  
To determine the role of neurophysiological mechanisms in COS, while adjusting for these 
important covariates, we will characterize a novel phenotype of dysmenorrhea with bladder pain 
indicative of COS (D+COS). In our preliminary studies, women with the D+COS phenotype 
exhibited prolonged pelvic pain report in response to a mechanical vaginal stimulus. This hyperalgesia is common among CPP patients. However, in contrast to women with C PP, 
women with D+COS do not show significant psychological dysfunction. These findings imply dysmenorrhea, independent of psychological factors, influences vulnerability to pelvic pain. Additionally, our preliminary data and work by [CONTACT_387631]
18,[ADDRESS_485712] the 
hypothesis that repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_387605].   
COS may be reversible under ideal circumstances. Hormonal treatment of dysmenorrhea has already been shown to partially alleviate co-morbid irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and

(PBS).[ADDRESS_485713]

and progestin) oral 
contraceptive (OC) 
users report less 
bladder pain at 
innocuous filling 
volum es. We would 
like to investigate 
further whether this 
is a modifiable 
phenotype. An equally critical issue involves identifying which patients would respond best to 
hormonal treatment. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results on whether OCs improv e 
pain modulation.24,25 These studies did not address dysmenorrhea or the usage of continuous 
OCs, which ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_387606] -induced uterine nerve 
activation. We hypothesize eliminating a painful stimulus with cyclical OCs will improve 
descending inhibition and reduce COS.   (see Diagram 1) 
 
To determine whether alterations in pain are due to changes in descending inhibition, spi[INVESTIGATOR_387607], or peripheral sensitivity we will use established tests for quantitative sensory 
testing. Changes in descending inhibition will be tested with conditioned pain modulation ( CPM ). 
26  CPM involves presenting a counter -stimulus (such as cold water) to one part of the body and 
then simultaneously measuring the differential sensory response to a noxious stimulus 
elsewhere. The degree of descending inhibition is quantified by [CONTACT_387632] a counter -stimulus compared to the unmatched paradigm. Changes in 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_387608] .[ADDRESS_485714] nociceptive modulation.  
If OCs are shown to improve descending inhibition, our results will extend prior findings in 
animals that demonstrate descending inhibition is needed to maintain chronic pain states.
10 In 
humans, descending inhibition is impaired by [CONTACT_387633]28,29 but normalizes with 
successful interventions.30 Additionall y, our results will establish a relationship between 
descending inhibition and COS allowing for the development of preventative strategies.31  
Since endometriosis and fibroids are identifiable anatomical conditions but understanding of 
their mechanistic contribution to dysmenorrhea an d bladder pain is limited , we will include 
confirmed endometriosis participants and fibroids participants mixed within our dysmenorrhea  Diagram 1: We hypothesize  repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_387609]. Additional local sensitization in the presence of worsening of 
descending inhibition may result in COS, provoked pelvic pain and 
bladder hyperalgesia. Elevated concentration of E2 in dysmenorrhea (not 
shown) could also increase bladder pain.

cohort to determine which effects produced by [CONTACT_387634].  
 
Participants are divided into t wo arms. Arm #1 participants include women ages 18 -45 
with dysmenorrhea, women with painful bladder syndrome (PBS), and healthy controls. 
Arm #2 includes women ages 18 -45 with chronic pain or special healthy controls .  
 
Our hypotheses on mechanisms responsible for the transition of menstrual pain to bladder pain 
will be tested through the following phase s:  
 
Phase  #1 (includes Arm #1 and Arm #2 participants) : To determine if dysmenorrhea with 
concomitant bladder pain sensitivity exhibits neurophysiological features consistent with 
established CPP. Women with dysmenorrhea without COS and women with chronic pain 
conditions outside of the pelvic region will be used a s controls.  Quantitative sensory testing 
(QST) and a noninvasive bladder pain test we previously have validated will be used to 
determine whether impairments in descending inhibition and pelvic sensitivity are responsible 
for vulnerability to COS in women with dysmenorrhea (with and without COS) and/or CPP.  
 Phase  #2 (includes a subset of Arm #1 participants only) : To di fferentiate the individual 
contributions of circulating sex hormones and repeated sensitizing events (painful menses) on 
descending and peripheral mechanisms of bladder pain . The same QST/bladder pain measures 
studied in Phase  #1 will be retested within th e D+COS and PBS subjects following a one -year 
randomized trial of cyclical vs. continuous OCs vs. no treatment. We added a second option for 
those who are randomized to Phase [ADDRESS_485715] for understanding the etiology of CPP/PBS. Secondly, identifyi ng early markers of risk 
could ultimately underlie an effective prevention strategy because the onset of PBS is often 
gradual with limited symptoms.

B. Research Design and Methods  
B.1. Overview:  
Diagram 2:  After screening and washout, dysmenorrhea sufferers with and without COS, PBS 
patients, and chronic pain participants (with and without pelvic pain conditions)  will be compared 
with controls on experimental pain sensitivity tests ( PPT), which measure descending inhibition 
(CPM ) and pelvic and bladder sensitivity  (Phase  #1). Women with dysmenorrhea with COS and 
PBS will be asked to participate in Phase  #2. In Phase  #2, a trial of cyclic and continuous OCs

 will be used to differentiate the individual contributions of circulating sex hormones and repeated 
sensitizing events (painful menstrual periods) on descending and  peripheral mechanisms of 
bladder pain. All participants will also complete a yearly follow -up questionnaire for 5 years (for 
participants who complete phase 2, the year 1 questionnaire will be incorporated into the 12 -
month testing Assessment #3 testing s ession).  
This study will enroll a total of approximately 1,080 participant s (See Appendix 1 ). Of those 
subjects, all will be enrolled at NorthShore Unive rsity HealthSystem (NorthShore) . This leaves a 
total of approximately 1,0 80 participants to be enrolled in arm #1 (1,020) and arm #2 (60) of the 
study.  We anticipate that some arm 1 and arm 2 participants (up to 415 arm 1 and 10 arm 2 
participants) may become ineligible after the screen visit and/or daily diary data because their 
pain levels do not clear ly place them into a defined  group, they are enrolled as a dysmenorrhea 
participant but do not show evidence of COS, medic al reasons are identified at the screen visit 
that were not identified during the phone screen, or they become lost to follow -up between the 
screen and assessment visit. We expect approximately 645 arm 1 and arm 2 participants will 
continue the study and c omplete Phase 1; 515 will be women with dysmenorrhea, 40 will be 
women with PBS,  40 will be healthy women without pelvic pain or painful periods, 7 will be 
“special” healthy controls, and 43 will be women with chronic pain.   
Chronic pain participants will  be allowed to skip portions of the assessment based on their pain 
conditions and will be enrolled using drastically different inclusion/exclusion criteria compared to 
other groups. We anticipate approximately [ADDRESS_485718] approximately 50 women who were randomized will decide not to participate in phase 2 
but will choose to come back  in a year later for an additional asse ssment visit for long term 
follow up data.  Our ultimate goal is to prevent and reverse COS. We will ask all subjects to 
complete an at home yearly follow -up questionnaire for 5 years (for participants who complete 
phase  2, the year 1 questionnaire will be incorporated into the 12 -month testing Assessment #3 
testing session). If our hypotheses are correct about descending inhibition impairments being reversible with OCs, our work will spawn prevention studies for other highly co -morbid 
conditions associated with dysmenorrhea such as headache and fibromyalgia.  
 
C1: Phase  1 Methods  
 
C1.a Study Participants : Reproductive -age women (age 18 -45) with: ARM 1: a) 
dysmenorrhea, b) dysmenorrhea and bladder sensitivity (D+COS) , c) painful bladder syndrome 
(PBS) , d) healthy, pain -free controls,  ARM 2:  e) 10 “special” healthy control participants, and f) 
50 chronic pain female patients.  
 
Participants will primarily be recruited from NorthShore’s clinical sites in the Chicago -area. 
Participants may also be recruited from the community through advertising in NorthShore 
University HealthSystem’s outpatient clinics ; web -based advertising; posters and flyers in local 
businesses (coffee shops, athletic clubs)  and on college campuses; referrals from local 
gynecologists; and the Illinois Women’s Health Registry based at Northwestern University’s 
Feinberg School of Medicine. All flyers and ads will be IRB approved. In our ads, we will call the 
study CRAMPP  (Chronic Risk Associated with Menstrual Pelvic Pain).  Participants may call our 
research hotline directly or after they indicate interest and give permission, the ir doctor will send 
us their contact [CONTACT_32431] a research coordinator will call the patient to formally assess 
eligibility using a phone screen. At the end of the phone screen, adult participants will be asked 
if we have permission to put their phone  screen and contact [CONTACT_387635].

A research coordinator may periodically screen  NorthShore’s electronic medical records 
databases (EPIC) for patients within the NorthShore Medical Group system meeting eligibility 
criteria via a data warehouse request. This process will include the following:  
 
1. Participant identification: Electronic da tabases will be queried for outpatient encounters 
using the ICD -9 codes associated with pelvic pain symptoms: endometriosis [617.x], 
uterine leiomyoma [218.x], dysmenorrhea [625.3], unspecified symptoms associated 
with pelvic organs [625.9], premenstrual t ension syndromes [625.4], and other disorders 
of menstruation and abnormal bleeding from the female genital tract [626.8]. Bladder 
pain participants will be queried from: other symptoms involving the urinary system 
[788.99], dysuria [788.1], and interstiti al cystitis [595.1].  
 
2. The physicians of eligible women will be asked to ask the patient if they might be 
interested (via phone, letter, or in person during an appointment) and if we have 
permission to contact [CONTACT_476] (via phone, letter, or in person during a n appointment). The 
physician will then notify us. Alternatively, the physician can just give the patient our 
contact [CONTACT_387636].  
  
Only girls and  women will be recruited because the study addresses dysmenorrhe a and chronic 
pelvic pain, conditions unique to females. Notably, bladder pain syndrome also predominately 
affects women.   Women above age 45 are excluded since dysmenorrhea only affects pre -
menopausal women.  
  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Co ntrols, Dysmenorrhea, and PBS Participants  
(Arm 1)  
 
Inclusion criteria:  Cases:  1) Dysmenorrhea cases will have: a) average menstrual pain ≥ 5/10 
(0=no pain and 10=the worst imaginable pain) with menses or withdrawal uterine bleeding from 
cyclic OCs without  painkillers, b)  menstrual pain in the region between the umbilicus and the 
perineum, above the level of the inguinal ligament and c) indication the participant has attempted to resolve pain by [CONTACT_387637] (including NSAIDs and/or OCs). Participants who 
endorse bladder symptoms on the phone screen will be preferentially recruited; those who do not endorse bladder sympto ms may be determined ineligible . We found our previous questions 
to have limited predictive value. Notably because we only want to collect the minimum amount 
of information necessary to determine eligibility on the phone screen, we may not ask all 
bladder questions (depending on wha t future statistics show in regards to what bladder 
questions accurately predict COS).  Participants will complete a daily diary to verify menstrual 
pain during the screening period.
[ADDRESS_485719] 
indicate menstrual pain ≥ 5/[ADDRESS_485720] daily life or a history of more than 24 migraines per year. 2) D+COS participants will meet criteria for Dysmenorrhea cases, with > 15 bladder 
pain on a 0 -100 visual analogue scale (VAS) during either first sensation or first urge  at 
assessment visit #1.  Initially participants will be enrolle d as dysmenorrhea participants and their 
final eligibility for D+COS will be determined after their assessment #1 visit . 3) Diagnosis of PBS 
participants  will be confirmed by [CONTACT_387638] (>3 months) pelvic pain 
(average intensity ≥ 3 /10), pressure, or discomfort related to the bladder accompanied by [CONTACT_387639].
[ADDRESS_485721] other chronic pain 
conditions.  
 
Controls:  1) Healthy control cases  will have a) average pain ≤ 3/10 with menses or with 
withdrawal uterine bleeding from cyclical OCs and b) no concurrent chronic pain diagnoses or ≥ 
[ADDRESS_485722] year . Healthy controls with < 2 migraines per year will be recrui ting 
preferentially.  
 Exclusion criteria  for dysmenorrhea (and D+COS), PBS and healthy control cases includes: a) 
presence of active pelvic or abdominal malignancies (primary or metastatic), b) absence of 
regular menses (including current pregnancy, recen t pregnancy, or active breast feeding) c) 
active genitourinary infection in the last four weeks, d) unable to read or comprehend the 
informed consent in English, e) unwilling to complete study procedures f) presence of 
hypertension or risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] h ypertension, and g) unwilling to withdraw from OCs for at 
least one cycle prior to the Phase  #1 study visit . Participants with a history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_387610].  
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for “Special” Healthy Controls and Chronic Pain Participants 
(Arm 2 ) 
 
Special Healthy Controls (n=10 ) will be enrolled under the same inclusion and exclusion 
criteria as healthy controls, however, special healthy controls wil l not be required to have regular 
periods or abstain from hormonal contraception, and will not be assessed for migraines with 
aura.  
 Chronic pain cases (n=50 ) will have a diagnosed, documented (reviewed by [CONTACT_976]) chronic pain 
disorder greater than six months’ duration, which has required at least 2 different prescription 
treatments and/or surgical management. They must report an average pain of at least 5/[ADDRESS_485723] month.  We will accept participants with any type of chronic pain ( except for individuals 
with bilateral knee and hand pain) but anticipate many of our chronic pain participants to suffer from fibromyalgia, lower back pain, and chronic pelvic pain (including irritable bowel syndrome).  
 
Of note, special healthy controls o r chronic pain cases will not be excluded for unwillingness to 
undergo internal PPT testing, visual sensory testing, hip or head PPT. These groups may waive 
these procedures but still remain eligible to choose to participate in rest of the study.    
  
Exclusion criteria  for Chronic pain cases (n=50)  and Special Healthy Controls  includes a) 
presence of active pelvic or abdominal malignancies (primary or metastatic), b) pregnancy, c) 
active genitourinary infection in the last four weeks, d) unable to read or comprehend the 
informed consent in English, e) unwilling to und ergo study procedures (except internal PPT 
testing, visual sensory testing, hip or head PPT which may be waived in these groups) ,  f) 
bilateral hand or knee pain , or g) absence of ovaries.  
 To summarize , Chronic Pain C ases  and Special Healthy Controls  may have absence of regular 
menses, hypertension, a history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (in which case sensory testing will not be performed)  or migraines with aura , and be unwilling/unable to abstain from hormonal 
contraception.  
 
Phone Screen  
All callers will complete a phone screen to assess eligibili ty before being  scheduled for a screen 
 
8 
 visit. Because of the drastically different inclusion/exclusion criteria,  separate phone screen s will 
be used for arm 1 ( healthy control, dysmenorrhea, and PBS participants)  than for  arm 2 (special 
healthy control and  chronic pain participants.  At the end of the phone screen, all callers who 
complete an arm #1 or arm #[ADDRESS_485724] them for future studies. Participants who indicate 
yes will be added to our recruitment registry study upon study closeout. Eligible callers will be 
scheduled for a screening visit . 
 Note we may attempt to match groups for age and demographics. Thus, in some cases, 
eligibility on the phone screen may vary based on the study’s current need for individuals with 
certain demographics for each group. We may also require dysmenorrhea participa nts to 
endorse bladder symptoms on the phone screen in order for them to be eligible to come in for a screen visit.  
 
Procedures Completed During Each Study Visit :  During each testing session, participants 
will have their blood pressure and pulse taken, u rine collected, and a urine pregnancy test 
(unless no uterus) completed.  
 
C1.b Screening Visit : Informed consent will be obtained by a trained research assistant before 
any questionnaires or study procedures are completed. 
 
 
Adult Participants  (arm #1 and arm #2) will complete the following questionnaires: a) complete 
medical, surgical, and gynecological history, and b) a psychosocial assessment using short -
form PROMIS instruments (pain behavior, pain interference, fatigue, sleep,  anxiety, depression, 
physical function,  satisfaction with participation in social roles, and 10 item global health scale).
35 Participants will also complete the following pain rating questionnaires (the Interstitial 
Cystitis Problem and Symptom I ndices, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Revised Short -form 
McGill Pain Inventory72 and MIDAS headache questionnaire.)[ADDRESS_485725] been linked 
to pain intensity and quality of life in CPP sufferers, and catastrophizing (rumination, 
magnification, and feelings of helplessness about pain) is a well -validated intervention target for 
many cognitive -behavioral approaches  for chronic pain.36–39 Validated, CP P-specific 
assessment tools will be used to characterize IBS (Rome III criteria)40 and PBS symptoms 
(Genitourinary Pain Index).41 Subjects will also complete the Female Sexual Functi on Index 
(FSFI)68 and BSI -18 based questionnaire containing 6 somatization questions selected from the 
BSI-1869 plus a vision question, and the Complex Medical Symptoms Inventory (CMSI) -General, 
Fibromyalgia Symptoms, Fatigue, and Vulvodynia sections.70,[ADDRESS_485726] through the  study, a n amendment was made for arm #1 and arm #2 study 
participants were freed from the requirement to  undergo a  complete  gynecologic exam during 
the screen visit  and as part of phase 1 participation . Instead, only arm #1 painful bladder 
syndrome and D+COS participants who randomize into phase [ADDRESS_485727] phase 2 
assessment visit (i.e. Assessment Visit #2 - 6 month visit) . Transvaginal ultrasound and/or 
abdominal ultrasound may be performed on dysmenorrhea participants who se exam  and/or 
history is suggestive of ovarian or uterine masses.  Arm #1 PBS participants may choose to 
complete the gynecological exam durin g their screen visit if they prefer since their 
randomization to phase 2 is already determined.  
 
Even though a gynecological exam is no longer required for phase #1, the second phase 1 visit 
 
9 
 (assessment visit #1) includes internal vaginal pressure -pain th reshold testing, which is similar 
in nature to the pelvic floor portion  of a gynecological exam. Thus, for participants who have 
never had a gynecological exam, a study nurse or study doctor may complete a simple exam of 
the pelvic floor at the screen to p romote understanding of the internal vaginal pressure -pain 
threshold testing that will be completed at the assessment. This ensures that the integrity of our 
data is not biased by [CONTACT_387640]. Participants will be asked whether they have ever 
had a gynecological exam on the phone screen and a simple exam of the pelvic floor for those 
that say they have never had an exam will be scheduled into their screen.   
 Participants entering phase [ADDRESS_485728] in person or over the phone with a study doctor or study nurse before the pi[INVESTIGATOR_387611].   
 
Note arm #[ADDRESS_485729] in which subjects report the amount of pain they feel on a 0 -10 numerical rating 
scale after inserting a standardized tampon (Tampax original regular with plastic applicator, 
Proctor and Gamble ).  
 
Participants reporting average menstrual pain ≥ 5/10 o n the phone screen (dysmenorrhea 
participants) will undergo a rapid version of the bladder test. Participants will be asked to rate 
their bladder pain on a 0 -100 VAS scale when they reach “first urge.” If a participant arrives to 
the visit already at first  urge, we will have them rate their pain and if not ≥ 10, we will wait [ADDRESS_485730] urge will 
be encouraged to drink water (at least 20 oz) during the screening visit until they reach first urge 
at which point a pain rating will be attained. After they reach first urge, they can go to the 
bathroom and leave their urine sample. Those with ≥ 10/[ADDRESS_485731] 
urge and/or those with a GUPI [INVESTIGATOR_103835] ≥ 8 will be preferentially recruited into this study. In other 
words , we may eliminate some participants without evidence for COS (using the rapid bladder 
test FU pain score and po ssible using GUPI [INVESTIGATOR_103835]) after the screen visit . However, for those 
that continue, final group assignment will be determined by [CONTACT_387641] #1.    
 C1.c Between visit home tasks: Training of arm #1 and arm #2 participants to fil l out daily 
diaries and how to use ovulation kits to determine their menstrual phase prior to their next visit 
will be provided by [CONTACT_387642] (for ovulation kits, only for those patients where 
menstrual phase changes can be defined). The da ily diary will be completed using REDCap and 
asks them to rate their menstrual, bladder, and bowel pain (using a numeric rating scale where 0-no pain, [ADDRESS_485732] pain imaginable), describe any bleeding, enter results of ovulation tests, and 
list dose, type a nd use of painkillers. For special healthy controls and chronic pain participants  
(arm #2), the daily diary includes one additional pain rating where participants can choose the 
relevant area of pain from a scroll down menu and rate their pain in that area  from [ADDRESS_485733] ID # (see data collection section D). Dysmenorrhea, healthy control, and PBS 
participants will be asked to fill out daily diary entri es for all days between their screening visit 
and assessment #1. Participants in the special healthy control and chronic pain groups will be 
asked to complete daily diaries starting the day after their screen visit and continu ing for 35 
days, regardless of when their assessment visit is scheduled.  
 
C1.d Washout for arm #1 participants on OCs (not relevant for arm #2 ): Those on OCs at 
enrollment will complete a washout lasting a minimum of one menstrual flow in order to 
accurately confirm dysmenorrhea severity with daily diaries. Bleeding that occurs within [ADDRESS_485734] awal bleed followed by [CONTACT_387643] (4 weeks) plus the time it takes 
them to enter their luteal phase (approximately 3 weeks). In the case that a woman does not 
experience withdrawal bleeding within 7 days of the cessation of birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] s, determination 
of whether the bleeding that does eventually occur is the result of delayed withdrawal bleeding or menstruation will be made on a case -by-case basis.  In the case that we cannot confirm 
group eligibility from one menstrual flow on the dail y diary (i.e. they did not have great enough 
pain), we may ask the participant to continue to abstain from hormonal contraception for a 
second menstrual flow. If they are still not eligible after two menstrual cycles, they will be deemed ineligible or if a pplicable (pain is 3 or less on all days), switched to the healthy control 
group.  
 
For the subset of participants who were using hormonal contraception to manage chronic or 
menstrual pelvic pain, and whom express concern about pain management during phase  1, the 
study doctor will discuss pain control options and if necessary, and the participant desires, 
prescribe Tylenol #3, Tramadol 50mg, or Norco 5/325. We expect these conditions to apply to a small subset of participants (less than 10). The participant  may alternatively see their regular 
physician to address this issue. All other participants will be asked to manage their pain in the same ways they normally manage pain (e.g., over -the-counter painkillers, heat pads, etc.). All 
participants will be asked  to indicate in their daily diary if they took any painkillers each day and 
if so, what medication and how much.  
   
C1.e Assessment visit:  Arm #1 and Arm #2 p articipants with regular periods and/or who are 
not using hormonal contraception  will be asked to contact [CONTACT_387644]. The assessment visit will be scheduled during the anticipated participant’s luteal phase ([ADDRESS_485735] 
unusually short o r long cycles).  They also will be give ovulation kits and asked to complete 
them starting day 10 of their cycle up until their scheduled assessment visit to give us additional 
data about their menstrual phase. Bladder pain is less likely to be confounded with menstrual or 
ovulation pain during the luteal phase.  
 
Special healthy controls and chronic pain participants ( Arm 2) who do not have regular 
menstrual periods and/or are on hormonal contraception  will not be required to use ovulat ion 
kits and instead visits will be scheduled at a time we do not expect any bleeding and 
approximately 2 -6 weeks (but up to four months) after their screen visit.  
 
The time between the screen visit and assessment visit may vary based on participant’s 
personal schedule and ability to confirm ovulation status and group eligibility (if applicable) but 
will not exceed four months or be less than two weeks.  
 
 
11 
 For arm #1 participants (healthy controls, dysmenorrhea, and PBS participants) , group 
assignment is confirmed from one to four months of daily diaries. If the participant is not eligible 
for the originally assigned group after the first flow, we will ask the participant to complete the 
daily diary through a second menstrual flow to determine eligibility. If they are still not eligible for 
the originally assigned group after two flows, we will transfer the participant to the applicable 
group or inform the participant she is ineligible.  
 
For arm #2 participants ( Special healthy control  and chron ic pain  participants)  are asked to 
complete daily diaries starting one day after their screen visit  and for [ADDRESS_485736] demonstrate menstrual pain less t han 4/10 and not indicate consistent pain ratings. 
Chronic pain or healthy control cases whose pain status is unclear will be handled on a case -by-
case basis.  
 
 
Assessment Visit #1  (Arm 1 and Arm 2)  
Assessment Visits are very long so we will offer snacks to the participants (e.g., teddy grahams and fruit roll -ups).  
 
During the assessment visit, EMG (of different muscle groups), EKG, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_387612].  EMG leads will 
be placed on the lower abdomen and right knee during the bladder testing to measure muscular 
recruitment . The abdominal EMG leads will be moved to the left knee once the bladder pain test 
is completed. The EKG leads and respi[INVESTIGATOR_387613]. The 
autonomic activity will be recorded to verify nociceptive experience.  
 
Bladder pain test:  All participants will first undergo bladder pain testing described in our 
validation stu dy2. Subjects will be provided directions for the bladder study. The bladder study 
involves voiding and obtaining baseline measurements of bladder volume with a 3D ultraso und 
abdominal transducer (GE Voluson 750, Wauwatosa, WI). After hydration with [ADDRESS_485737] levels of bladder urgency: first 
sensation, first urge, and maximum tolerance and volumetric measureme nts of the bladder will 
be made. At each of these time points and every 15 minutes, 0 -10 VAS measurements of pain 
and urgency are recorded. After scanning at maximum tolerance, subjects will urinate in a 
graded toilet hat to allow for measurement and savin g a urinary specimen.  Samples will be 
banked for analyses. If the participant gives permission in the consent form, urine samples will 
continue to be stored after the study is completed for possible future analyses by [CONTACT_387645]’s health conditions.  If the participant does not give permission in the consent form for 
analyses beyond the current study, their sample will be destroyed upon study completion.  
Questionnaires:   The previous validated questionnaires from the screening visit will again be 
employed during the bladder testing . Participants will also complete a handedness 
questionnaire.

 (Diagram 3) and a ramp rate of 0.5 kg/cm2/s. Internal trials may be terminated by [CONTACT_387646] 
3.0 kg/cm2.  A trained clinician will perform all pressure -pain tests.  Subjects will report the pain 
at the time they pressed the button on a NRS scale immediately after testing ea ch individual 
site. After a two -minute break, the sites will be retested again. In order to compare within -
subject results from the three assessment visits and in order to standardize timing of post -
testing time scores (collected every 5 minutes as described below), the order of testing sites will 
not be counterbalanced.    
 
Subjects will be allowed to rest for anothe r [ADDRESS_485738] will be queried on the level of 
NRS pain at each site again (shoulder, hip, knee, forehead, global vagina). Subjects will be 
queried every 5 minutes until pain returns to baseline levels or up to 30 minutes (the time of 
resolution in minutes will also be recorded).  
 
Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) : CPM testing involves repeating pressure pain threshold 
testing in the presence of a heterotopic stimulus (in this case cold water). The testing stimulus 
will be a mechanical pressure on the left medial knee fat pad. As in the first task, pressure will 
be applied (0.5 kg/cm2/s ramp) until the participant achieves pressure pain threshold. Baseline 
pressure pain thresholds of the testing stimulus on the left knee and left shoulder will be 
determined. After waiting approximately [ADDRESS_485739] into a bucket of water maintained 
between 0 -6° C. After 10 s of immersion, subjects will be asked to rate their level of hand pain 
on a NRS 0 -10 scale. After 20s o f immersion, the pressure pain threshold will be re -applied  
using a 0.5 kg/cm2/s ramp rate  at the knee  and the participant will be asked to rate their knee 
pain at the time they reached threshold (i.e. pressed the button) on a NRS 0-10 scale . After 
testing (~20s of immersion), subjects will immediately remove their hand  and the p ressure pain 
threshold will be determined at the shoulder. After  waiting [ADDRESS_485740] reliable measurement of descending inhibition.
47,48  
 
Tempor al Summation (TS) : Participants will be instrumented to undergo tests of spi[INVESTIGATOR_387614]. Temporal summation will be tested using an algometer on the right medial knee fat 
pad.  We will repeatedly apply an amount of pressure (0.5 kg/cm2/s ramp rate;  ITI = 5 -15 
seconds) equal to the average of the participant’s two pressure pain thresholds assessed during 
the first task. After each press, the participant will be asked to rate their pain on a n NRS 0-[ADDRESS_485741].   
 
EEG Testing : Subjects will be instrumented with a standard EEG cap .  Encephalography (EEG) 
recordings will be obtained using a stan dard montage and equipment. A trained research 
assistant or nurse will place the EEG cap and electrodes. All participants will undergo a resting state EEG task in order to analyze brain activity patterns associated with pain behavior. 
Participants will be requested to focus on a fixation cross on a computer monitor with their eyes 
open and sitting with their eyes closed for one minute each. In total, the task is expected to take 10 minutes.  All participants w ill complete a handedness questionnaire,
49 consisting of a series of 
questions asking which hand they use for different activities, in REDCap, which will help us 
interpret our EEG results.

 Sensory Amplification Tests:  To evaluate whether sensitivity extends to other modalities we will 
use a software application that measures self -reported unpleasantness to increasingly loud and 
bright stimuli (safe and well below thresholds that could cause auditory or visual damage).  
 
Auditory stimuli will be provided by [CONTACT_387647] a PC and transmitted through 
headphones calibrated by [CONTACT_387648]50 . Each stimulus will be a two -tone combination of 
[ADDRESS_485742] (A -weighted). After 
receiving instructions, the subject will be presented with a series of sounds, in random order of 
intensity. Afte r each 2 s stimulus, the participant will be asked to rate its unpleasantness from 0 
(“not at all unpleasant”) to 20 (“the most unpleasant sound imaginable”).  
 
Visual stimuli will be displayed on a computer monitor capable of providing up to 300 lux. In th is 
3 min task, two visual stimuli will be presented in an alternating block design.  The control 
stimulus is a fixed crosshair centered in the middle of a solid background; the experimental 
stimulus will be a flashing ( 12.5 Hz) blue/yellow checkerboard pre sented at varying levels of 
brightness (luminance) in both an ascending and random manner.  Each subject will be presented with [ADDRESS_485743] patterns alternated with 6 blanks patterns. Subjects will use a 0 (“not at all 
unpleasant”) to 20 (“the most unpleasant p attern imaginable”) numerical descriptor scale to rate 
the unpleasantness of each visual stimulus and the entire task.  
 The visual task may be annoying or elicit a headache or nausea in sensitive individuals. 
Participants may stop at any time.  
The sensory testing will take in total about 20 minutes and will be performed while the 
participant is connected to EEG.  
 
Additional quality controls: We may need to repeat a task, modify electrode positions, 
reconfigure equipment, or adjust features in the environme nt to evaluate the quality of our data 
acquisition scheme. For example, if a PPT measurement was not obtained or an electrode does 
not stay put, we may ask the subject to allow us to repeat additional measurements.  
All implanted quality controls with perm ission from the subject will be documented in the subject 
record.  
 
C1.f Hormone Measurements  with Blood (Arm 1 and Arm2) : We will ascertain that subjects 
have not had more than [ADDRESS_485744] 30 days. After completion of the pressure/pain testing , a trained nurse or physician will draw  up 
to [ADDRESS_485745] to the OCs from core laboratories .
51  If the 
participant gives permission in the consent form, blood samples may also be analyzed for 
genetics. If the participant gives permission in the consent form, blood samples will continue to 
be stored after the study is completed for possible future analyses by [CONTACT_387649]’s health conditions. If the participant does not give permission in the consent form for analyses beyond 
the current study, their sample will be destroyed u pon study completion.  
 
C1.g Follow -up questionnaires : We will ask  arm [ADDRESS_485746] during their assessment #3 visit. All participants that 
complete phase 1 (Screen + Assessment #1), including phase 2 dropouts, will be asked to 
complete the annual follow -up questionnaire.  
 
 
C1.h Data Analysis/Sample Size Requirements: The primary outcomes under this hypothesis 
will be [1] bladder pain at FU, [2] pelvic hyperalgesia (VAS, time to return to baseline pain), 
reflecting peripheral dysfunction/sensitization, and [3] centrally mediated hyperalgesia (CPM, bodily pain thresholds).   
Factor [1], Bladder pain at FU:  Our preliminary data on healthy subjects and women with 
dysmenorrhea, in combination with other studies investigating migraine and PBS, suggests effect sizes between 1.4 -5.6 (Cohen’s d). As a control comparison, we expe ct that women with 
chronic pain will have levels of bladder and pelvic sensitivity comparable to health y subjects. 
We will perform t -tests for each of these three pain variables using pairwise contrasts and 
appropriate Bonferroni corrections for six group comparisons.  
Factor [2], pelvic hyperalgesia:  To confirm pelvic hyperalgesia ( but not necessarily pelvic PPT ) 
is higher in those with bladder pain, we will show bladder pain and pelvic hyperalgesia (both VAS and TIME) are higher in D+COS than healthy pain -free controls (H), dysmenorrhea only 
(D), and chronic pain patients  (P).  Similarly bladder pain, pelvic hyperalgesia and pelvic floor 
pain sensitivity (PPT) are anticipated to be greater in PBS than H, and D.  
Factor [3], central ly mediated hyperalgesia:  Greater central dysfunction manifest by [CONTACT_387650] D+COS, PBS, and P to D and H. We estimate 15 subjects per group will provide adequate 
power (g -power, a priori t -test, a=0.05, b=0.2).  To verify we have adequate phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_387615], we have included the positive control group with chronic pain (P).  We assumed the Group

Table X:  Sample sizes and hypothesized results in Z -scores or range of Z -scores (relative to 
healthy) for subjects that are healthy (H), have dysmenorrhea (D), have cross organ 
sensitization (D+COS), PBS, or chronic pain (P). MSA indicates Kaiser’s measure of samp ling 
adequacy. Numbers in italics indicated minimum detectable hypothesized score with current 
sample size. Z -scores based on preliminary data, or others indicated by [CONTACT_97518] (a: 9, 
b:,c:11,13). Effects temporal summation in these populations are unknown, but effect sizes as 
large as 1.[ADDRESS_485747] been reported for fibromyalgia . Dashes (-) indicate unknown effect size.  
 
[ADDRESS_485748] size of 0.78 based on a meta -analysis (Lewis et al. 2012). Using a 2.6 allocation 
ratio, a priori power analysis (α=0.05, β=0.2), sugg ests we need [ADDRESS_485749] a difference in the mean CPM. Additionally, the 
utilization of 50 chronic pain patients will allow us to use regression to identify up to 5 predicted 
factors associated CPM with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.3 even after correcting for 
multiple comparisons (α=0.05, β=0.2) as suggested by [CONTACT_1629] a priori random model power 
analysis.   This will be readily captured as our global study design encompasses a larger sample 
size (Table X) to handle anticipated secondary analysis and projected needs for completion of 
Phase  #2.  
Additional confirmatory analysis: Special healthy control subjects (n=10), we will verify special 
healthy control subjects do not differ from original en rolled healthy control subjects (n=20) to 
ascertain chronic subjects (P) participating in the trial are not treated differently under blinded 
conditions.  
For th e secondary analysis of Phase  #1, we will evaluate the D+COS (provoked bladder pain) 
phenotype while accounting for menstrual history (including historical OC exposure), hormonal factors, anxiety, and depression. To determine the relative contribution of t hese secondary 
variables on bladder pain, we will perform principal component 
analysis (PCA). We have adequately powered the analysis of these 
potential covariates consistent with a  bootstrap (n=1000 
replications, Fig Y) model based on our preliminary data  and 
studies by [CONTACT_2312] (described in Table X). Even with weak 
correlations (r=.3), PCA can detect 3 primary factors with our projected sample size. PCA is an optimal method to identify the 
mechanisms responsible for bladder pain. Historically PCA with 
even  smaller sample sizes has been employed to measure how  
copi[INVESTIGATOR_387616]
52 
(n=20) and to show that different pain testing modalities are related 
to differential psychosocial profiles53 (n=188).  Ev en if PCA fails, we 
can make many direct comparisons beyond what is described here 
with t -tests.  
C1.i Expected outcomes: (1) Abnormal CPM is the primary 
predictor of widespread pain sensitivity observed in dysmenorrhea, D+COS and PBS. Results would be insightful if CPM was worse in 
participants with D+COS and PBS than those with dysmenorrhea alone because this would 
indicate CPM mechanisms are involved in COS. On the other hand, if CPM impairments are 
universal across chronic pain patie nts, PBS, D, and D+COS compared to healthy controls, this 
would indicate that pain independent of location and chronicity depends on impaired descending 
inhibition. This finding would be the basis for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a physiological biomarker for those at 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_387617]/PBS similar to approaches by [CONTACT_387651]
45,79. 
On the other hand, some pain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis114 and trapezius 
myalgia115 do not seem to exhibit CPM. The vulnerability to conditions unrel ated to CPM may 
involve either inflammatory or specific peripheral nerve events. If CPM does not correlate with 
widespread pain sensitivity or bladder pain phenotypes in this proposal, we have adequately 
powered our sample size to detect alternative mechan isms that could be responsible (e.g. 
menstrual, hormonal, psychological). Nevertheless, consistent with meta -analyses on the 
menstrual cycle54, psychological55 , and central factors on pain56, we anticipate central pain 
factors to explain the majority of the variance in bladder pain sensitivity.  Determining the 
relative importance of systemic E2 concentrations vs. other modifiable factors such as Fig Y:  Bootstrap 
simulation constructed 
assuming a range of 
correlations between 
potential mechanisms 
(e.g. pelvic hyperalgesia 
and bladder pain) indicate 
that even with weak 
correlations we can detect 
3 factors. Error bars show 
95% confidence intervals.  
 

 
[ADDRESS_485750] important mechanisms for reducing bladder pain 
sensitivity in vulnerable women.  
(2) Pelvic hyperalgesia and severity of menstrual pain are more common in D+COS 
phenotype vs. dysmenorrhea only. The identification of clinical biomarkers such  as severity of 
pain after a speculum exam (analogous to the post pelvic floor PPT pain report) can be obtained 
from our results. Our study results would provide evidence of the significance of this routine 
clinical exam in reliably predicting bladder sensitivity.  
C1.j Potential Problems: Primary and/or secondary comparisons are nonsignificant: a mixture 
of mechanisms are involved in D+COS phenotype or PBS.  We will confirm whether our 
paradigm was sufficient to detect deficits in CPM using our positive control group with chronic 
pain to  validate a true negative finding. Afterwards, w e will use cluster analyses to identify 
phenotype patterns and confirm mechan istic differences with banked serum. Why not examine 
additional hormones?  We are examining hormones that have been frequently studied in pain 
research and will bank serum allowing for the future possibility of studying others. What about 
endometriosis, fib roids and other known anatomic uterine pain conditions? To account for the 
common conditions (especially within our medical practice), we will include 10 confirmed 
endometriosis (operative report review) participants and 10 fibroids participants (ultrasoun d or 
surgical confirmation) mixed within our dysmenorrhea cohort to determine which effects 
produced by [CONTACT_387652].  
 
C2.  Methods for Phase  #2   
 
C2.a Participation criteria  
All phase  #1 participants with D+COS (pool of 95 candidates) or PBS (pool of 40) will be 
enrolled with intent to transition into phase  #2, though the second phase of the study will be 
presented as optional.  If they choose not to participate in their randomized grou p, they will have 
the option to come back in a year later for an additional assessment visit for long term follow up 
data.  These enrollment targets, accounting for a potential 35% dropout rate, will enroll 62 
participants with D+COS and 26 PBS. This will p rovide adequate power for the prespecified 
contrasts.  
Inclusion Criteria: 1) Participation in Phase  #1 and assigned to the Arm #1 PBS or D+COS 
group, 2) willing to comply with OC assignment (continuous for PBS; cyclical, continuous, or no 
OC for D+COS).  
Exclusion Criteria:  a) presence of active pelvic or abdominal malignancies (primary or 
metastatic), b) absence of regular menses (including current pregnancy, recent pregnancy, or 
active breast feeding), c) unwilling to undergo pelvic examination/testing, e ) standard 
contraindications to use of OCs:  
• Thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders, or a history thereof  
• Cerebrovascular or coronary heart disease  
• Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast  
• Endometrial cancer or other known or suspected estrogen -depe ndent neoplasia  
• Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding  
• Jaundice with prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_293273]  
• Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas  
• Known or suspected pregnancy  
• Hypersensitivity to any component  
• BMI >40  
 
18 
 • Lactation (< 6 weeks postpartum)  
• Age >35 years and smokes 15 cigarettes/day  
• Elevated blood pressure (160 / 100)  
• Chest pain (angina pectoris)  
• Vascular disease  
• Major surgery with prolonged immobilization  
• Complicated valvular heart disease  
• Migraine with focal neurologic symptoms  
• Diabetes w ith evidence of nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, vascular disease, or > 
20 years duration  
• Severe (decompensated) cirrhosis  
Women with persistent, nonphysiological ovarian cysts or with a fibroid larger than 5 cm will be 
excluded because of associated bleeding problems and likelihood to undergo surgery during 
participation. Women taking drugs listed on the manufacturer’s web site (such as penicillin and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]) that may reduce OC effectiveness will be instructed to use condoms as a backup 
form of co ntraception.  
C2.b Randomization:  NorthShore’s biostatistical core will assign D+COS participants to 
continuous OC, cyclical OC, or the untreated arm using a permuted -block randomization 
scheme with block sizes only known by [CONTACT_128070] (PBS as above will be only 
assigned to continuous OCs) adjusting for the unequal recruitment goals (n=10,26,26) . To the 
extent possible, the research nurse performing QST will be blinded to group assignment. 
Because of withdrawal bleeding in the cyclical group, w e cannot blind participants to their 
assignment. Drs. Tu and Senapati will be responsible for prescribing both cyclical or continuous 
OC usage and will assess the participant for contra -indications and answer questions at the 
screen visit. The study team w ill provide counseling that will emphasize the benefits and risks of 
OCs as well as the lack of protection against sexually transmitted diseases from OCs and options for backup contraceptive methods
. Participants will be instructed to begin OCs the 
Sunday immediately after commencing their menses or on a day that allows for personal choice. 
We will give all participants a “Tips for use of Oral Contraceptives” flyer.  
 
C2.c Trial of OC usage:  Participants in Phase  #2 of the study will be prescribed generic 
microgestin (20 µg ethinyl estradiol/1 mg norethindrone acetate), a lower estrogen -containing 
OC well -tolerated by [CONTACT_31267]. Microgestin has minimal breakthrough bleeding compared to a 
continuous OC regimen with higher estrogen concentration or different progestin57 or a cyclic 
paradigm with lower estrogen concentration.58 D+COS participants will be randomized into three 
study arms: cyclical OC usage (n=26) vs. continuous usage (n=26) vs. no OC (n=10). Less 
untreated subjects are needed as large effect sizes are expected compared to OC users. 
Cyclical OC users will be instructed to take [ADDRESS_485751] it filled at the Evanston Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_387618]. All refills will be 
distributed by [CONTACT_387653]. Separately from the D+COS randomization scheme, PBS 
participants will receive only conti nuous OC. This study design deliberately avoids randomizing 
chronically symptomatic PBS patients onto cyclical vs. continuous OCs, as the anticipated difference in outcomes is small, and therefore not likely to be favorable in recruiting subjects. 
However,  identifying which pain mechanisms (visceral and pelvic sensitivity) change following 
OC-induced hormonal suppression both in chronically symptomatic PBS sufferers vs. the 
 
19 
 asymptomatic D+COS patients may prove crucial to understand which PBS patients exhib it 
hormonally responsive pain.23 
 
C2.d Study Visits Participants in Phase  #2 will return to repeat experimental pain and sensory 
assessments identical to the initial Phase  #1 and complete the questionnaires referred to in the 
screening visit plus a side effects questionnaire at six months and one year after  OC initiation 
(which follows a two month washout in Phase  #1). These visits should occur on pi[INVESTIGATOR_219140] (not 
cycle days) 7 -21 of the cyclical group and any day for the continuous group, which is 
comparable to cycle days 15 -28 in Phase  #1. Control subjects n ot taking OCs will participate 
during their post -luteal phase days 15 -28 (similar to Phase  #1). This will make hormonal levels 
comparable and minimize any vaginal bleeding. For those who are randomized  to Phase 2 but 
decides to not  participate in their ran domized group, they may be asked to come in a year later 
for an additio nal assessment visit to obtain long term follow up data. These participants will be 
asked to complete dai ly diaries and ovulation kits for one month prior to the annual assessmen t 
visit, similar to P hase 1.  
 
C2.e Home Assessments:  Participants in Arm #2 will complete the daily diary during the fifth 
and eleventh month of OC administration33,60. They will also complete a monthly questio nnaire 
asking questions related to their pain, mental health, and any side effects they may be 
experiencing (comprised of the McGill Pain Inventory, a side -effects questionnaires, and 
PROMIS anxiety item bank, PROMIS depression item bank, and PROMIS pain i nterference 
item bank). They will not need to do these questionnaires during months 6 and 12 at home 
because they will do them during their study visit for assessments #2 and #3 respectively. When 
done at home, they should complete these assessments on or near day 15 of their pi[INVESTIGATOR_387619], day 15 of their menstrual cycle (15 days after their menstrual 
period started) for participants not taking OCPs, and simply 28 days apart for participants taking 
continuous OCP.  
 
C2.f Complia nce: To evaluate compliance, participants will be asked to return all used and 
partially used OCP pi[INVESTIGATOR_302970].  
 
C2.g Potential Adverse Events:  Breakthrough bleeding:  Participants in each arm will be 
counseled about uncommon risks of breakthrough uterine ble eding. Participants experiencing 
abnormal bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_387620], Drs. Tu and 
Senapati, to rule out cervical or vaginal sources of bleeding. Women who need management of 
breakthrough bleeding will be managed p er standard clinical protocols. Those needing to 
terminate OCs will also be withdrawn per standard protocols. Withdrawn participants will still be 
asked to complete the annual follow -up questionnaire and may be asked to still do the [ADDRESS_485752] pai n, 
shortness of breath, blurred vision, flashing lights, or blindness, or severe abdominal pain.  
 
C2.h Data Analysis/Sample Size Requirements: To complete Phase  2, we propose analyses 
assessing a) the effect of concurrent and historical OC exposure on experimental bladder pain, 
b) whether continuous and cyclical OC regimens differ in effect on bladder pain sensitivity (via 
elimination of priming by [CONTACT_387654]), and c) the effect of OCs on nociceptive 
mechanisms (pelvic hyperalgesia, conditioned pain modulation). The anticipated effect sizes 
with required sample sizes (which we meet/exceed) are listed in Table Z .  
 
20 
 (Z1) We will establish prospectively whether usage of cyclic or continuous 
OCs affects bladder pain sensitivity (on bladder filling test), in women with 
D+COS compared to women not on OCs. We are adequately powered to detect improvements in bladder pain, assum ing a 35% dropout rate 
(conservative estimate, well exceeding previously published rate of 18 -
24%
51,59) and accommodating a 1:5.2 ratio of non -OC to OC users. We will 
perform repeated measures ANOVA to determine if experimental bladder 
pain improves at 6 months compared to baseline in women with D+COS 
(all h aving washed out at enrollment). Follow -up results at [ADDRESS_485753] size (f=0.9) was estimated from our 
preliminary data above. Analyses will be adjusted with E2 and P4 levels as 
a covariate to determine if the effe ct of OCs on bladder pain is largely due 
to its effects on circulating hormones with standard methods60.  
(Z2) Similarly, we will establish whether among D+COS patients’ pelvic 
hyperalgesia and descending modulation, the hypothesized mechanisms 
responsible for bladder pain sensitivity, are affected by [CONTACT_387655]. We w ill 
perform a repeated measures ANOVA to determine whether significant 
improvements occur in pelvic hyperalgesia (VAS pain report, and time to 
normalize), pelvic PPT threshold, bodily PPT thresholds, temporal 
summation, and CPM in OC treated vs. untreated subjects at 6 and 12 
months. Cohen’s d’s for drugs that affect PPT61, temporal summation62 
and CPM63 range between 0.6 -0.9.  
(Z3) Similar to z1, we will determine if bladder pain sensitivity improves among PBS 
patients pre - and post -continuous OC exposure using repeated measures ANOVA (6 and 12 
months).  Although hormonal treatment has been shown to improve b ladder pain in 13/[ADDRESS_485754] size is not known. Prospectively OC usage has been 
shown to reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_387621] (d=0.8)64. We are adequately powered to 
detect an effect size as low as dz=0.6.   
(Z4) We will perform ANOVA to determine whether continuous OC usage is superior to 
cyclic usage for reducing bladder sensitivity, absolute levels of E2/P4, and dysmenorrhea in 
women with D+COS (6 and 12 mths). Legro and colleagues have established superiority of 
continuous OC usage over cyclic usage for dysmenorrhea (d=1.6) using a comparable sample 
size. After surgical removal of endometriosis, continuous OC usage is associated with less non -
menstrual pelvic pain than cyclic OC usage (d=0.8)65. Our published data2,[ADDRESS_485755] a difference of d=0.[ADDRESS_485756], temporal summation and CPM between groups.  
(Z5) To determine whether menstrual, hormonal, central or peripheral cha nges are most 
responsible for improvement or worsening of bladder pain, we will use a repeated measures 
design. We will compare menstrual history, pelvic hyperalgesia, pelvic floor PPTs, external PPTs, CPM, E2/P4 concentrations in D+COS subjects that have >50% improvement in 
experimental bladder pain to those that have <50% improvement (6 and 12 mths). A similar type analysis showed the effect of duloxetine on CPM in improving diabetic neuropathy (n=30).
31 If 
mechanistic differences are comparable to Yarnitsky (d=1.6), we are more tha n adequately 
powered with 62 subjects with D+COS accounting for attrition. To confirm the proposed mechanism we will perform multi -level factor analysis. We performed a bootstrap analysis with 
our hypothesized data set (n=1000 repetitions) and confirmed we  can measure 2 independent 
components (each consisting of 2 -5 factors) with 95% certainty (median Kaiser Sampling 
Adequacy =0.75).   ES  nreq npre npost

 C2.i Expected outcome:  We anticipate analyses (z1 -z5) will show OC usage reduces bladder 
pain primarily by [CONTACT_387656]. This finding 
would be consistent with preliminary observations in IBS and PBS.9,22,23,59,[ADDRESS_485757] as a 
covariate (z2,3,5).  Analysis z4 is expected  to show the continuous OC usage is superior to 
cyclic OC usage for improvement of PBS, in consensus with studies b y others on dysmenorrhea 
and COS.22,[ADDRESS_485758] observed a strong relationship between dysmenorrhea and 
bladder pain2,3, accomplishment of Phase  #2 will provide prospective evidence in a randomized 
controlled trial that bladder pain sensitivity is a modifiable risk factor and understan ding of the 
mechanisms responsible. They will be mailed the ovulation kits to complete before their 6 - and 
12-month visits.  
 
C2.j Potential Problems: Differences in OC management within each group:  There will likely 
be differences in treatments within groups because some participants will require additional OC pi[INVESTIGATOR_387622], and PBS subjects often rotate medications to treat pain flares. To 
account for confounding, all deviations will be documented and accounted for as a covariate. 
We previously confirmed the success of this strategy in our cross- sectional study showing that 
women on OCs have less bladder sensitivity (see section IV.c.1). Also, women who stop taking 
the birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_387623] -to-treat will not receive their monthly questionnaires 
on day 15 of each cycle (since presumably discontinuing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_387624]). They 
will continue to receive the monthly questionnaire every [ADDRESS_485759] had they 
continued the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  
 
D. Data Collection and Storage:  
Confidentiality:  data will be collected by [CONTACT_70910], who has already undergone 
human subjects protection training and has experience with data handling through our pi[INVESTIGATOR_387625].  All questionnaire data and data forms will be maintained in R EDCap and exported into 
excel sheets onto a password -protected server as needed for analysis.  The only paper forms 
used in this study will be the consent and W -9 forms (for payment) contain ing subject name (no 
ID), and a study overview checklist , oral contraceptive eligibility checklist, session notes form 
containing the subject ID only (no name). Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_150240] a locked office or cabinet. 
Electronic data will be coded only with  a unique study identifier for participants, linked to a single 
master list. The phone screen will also be maintained in REDCap and contain PHI. PHI is 
necessary to collect in order to create an Epic medical record for research participants.  At the conclu sion of the study, patient identifiers on any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_387626].  
 
Quality assurance: All questionnaires and data forms will be entered using REDCap. 
Questionnaire data will be reviewed at the time of each evaluatio n in REDCap by [CONTACT_387657].  For pressure -pain 
threshold, the data acquisition program will automatically save these values.  Data will be 
reviewed and backed up onto the shared drive  after each session . Computer parameters will 
identify potential outliers (using a two standard deviation cutoff) and illogical data, which will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_458].  Differences will be reconciled using the session notes form, w hich will be used to record any applicable extra information which may affect testing 
(e.g., temperature of room, participant very tired) or any errors that occurred during a session.

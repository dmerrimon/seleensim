  A. SPECIFIC AIMS       
 
  Populations all over the world are experiencing rapid increases  in the prevalence of obesity and 
diabetes [1-5].  To date, the public health response to the emerging obesity  epi[INVESTIGATOR_901693].  As a first line of response, professional bodies and government organizations have issued 
prevention guidelines, all of which include recommendations on levels of activity  energy expenditure (AEE) [ 6-
10].  However, even if fully implemented, it is not clear that the current recommendations on AEE would impact 
the trend in age-related weight gain.  In fact, there is virtually no direct evidence that can be brought to bear on 
the question of whether the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901694] -wide declines 
in habitual physical activity ( PA).   
  T o date, epi[INVESTIGATOR_901695] —primarily 
questionnaires.  These self-reported data capture only a small fraction of the total variance in activity and are potentially  confounded when they focus on leisure-time PA.  By [CONTACT_22242], direct measurement with doubly 
labeled water (DLW)  provides  a precise, unbiased estimate of all forms of non-resting energy expenditure.  
DLW has also been used to validate the new generation of accelerometers  which are efficient m easurement 
tools  for larger studies.   
  In this application we request support to apply these objective measurement tools to examine 
the “ecology of AEE”.  The study will take place in [ADDRESS_1264803], 
we will examine whether an individual’s amount or pattern of AEE is related to adiposity in a diverse sample of 
2,500 (i.e., 500 subjects/site x 5 sites) .  Second, we will test the ecological hypothesis that a decline in levels of 
AEE is an important cause of the rapid increases in obesity that are currently taking place in many societies.   
As an exploratory aim we will examine the role of selected adipocytokines and the appetite hormone ghrelin.  
 
  Accordingly, we propose to test the following H ypotheses :   
 
1)  AEE is negatively related to percent body fat in the 5 study populations at baseline, independent of     
dietary intake.  
  2)  AEE is negatively related to change in body  weight during follow -up, independent of dietary intake. 
  3)  Population mean levels of AEE are negatively related to population mean levels of obesity/relativ e 
 weight. 
 
4)  Adipocytokines (e.g. , adiponectin and leptin) and hormones (e.g. , ghrelin) influence weight regulation 
and insulin sensitivity  and interact with AEE.   
5)  Heavy metals, such as arsenic, mercury, lead and cadmium, are positively associated with obesity and markers of diabetes and CVD risk.  
6) Human gut and oral microbiome and plasma metabolites are associated with obesity through short chain 
fatty acids, a by[CONTACT_901743].   
  
 To test these hypotheses we will complete the following Specific Aims:   
 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 1)  Recruit 500 participants , ages 25 -45, from each of 5 populations (total N = 2,500); m easure AEE with 
accelerometry; collect 24-hour dietary recall s; assess fasting glucose/insulin, ghrelin, and adipocytokines 
(adiponectin, leptin).  
 
2)  Measure AEE using DLW in a random subset of 75 participants from each of the 5 populations at 
baseline (total n = 375).   
 
3)  Repeat AEE measurement with accelerometry on all participants at 24 months; repeat weight at 12 and 
24 months and body composition at 24 months. 
 
4)  Examine the relationship between AEE and body composition within and among populations at baseline 
and at follow -up; assess inter-relations of AEE and diet, glucose, insulin, ghrelin and adipocytokines . 
 
5) Measure serum 25(OH)D and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels in 500 adults from the 5 METS 
sites (total N=2,500) at baseline and determine associations with latitude, diet, physical activity, 
adiposity, blood pressure (BP), and biochemical risk factors for CVD (eg, insulin, glucose, adiponectin, leptin, cho lesterol).  
6) Examine the association between baseline serum 25(OH)D and iPTH levels and changes in body composition and blood pressure over 6.5 years of follow -up. 
7) Repeat measurement of serum 25(OH)D and iPTH at third follow -up examination (approximately 3.5 
years after baseline) and measure BMD using DXA in the available cohort.    
8) Identify a metabolite profile that predicts progression to IGT/T2D in diverse black populations spanning the epi[INVESTIGATOR_215021]. 
9) We hypothesize that the plasma metabolite profile at baseline (2009) will be significantly associated with changes in diabetic status over the same 6-year period (2009 to 2015), i.e. normal glucose 
tolerance (NGT) to IGT and/or T2D. 
Examine whether this metabolite profile is common between sites, and characterize the lifestyle components, including diet, and physical activity, which may account for any country differences. 
10) We hypothesize that, in addition to a baseline metabolite profile, lifestyle factors (improved diet quality, and greater physical activity) that vary according to epi[INVESTIGATOR_901696]/T2D over a 6-year period. 
11) To evaluate the independent and combined effects of metals (As, Cd, Pb, Hg) on body composition and 
markers of CM risk at baseline in 2,500 individuals living in 5 diverse countries. Hypothesis 1: Baseline metals concentrations are positively associated with a) elevated adiposity / obesity and b) markers of CM risk (central obesity, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), insulin resistance (IR), hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], high blood pressure), adjusting for diet, physical activity, and other potentially important confounding 
variables.  
12) To evaluate the independent and combined effects of metals (As, Cd, Hg, Pb) on incident obesity, IGT, 
IR and hypertension after 8 years of follow-up in the full cohort. Hypothesis 2: Exposure to metals is associated with increased risk of new -onset a) obesity, b) impaired glucose tolerance, c) insulin 
resistance, and d) hypertension in individuals who were healthy at baseline, adjusting for diet, physical 
activity, and other potentially important confounding variables.  
13) To explore the independent and combined effects of metals (As, Cd, Hg, Pb) on adipose-derived 
bioactive molecules/hormones as intermediate markers of diabetes risk.  
14) Hypothesis 3: Exposure to metals is associated with lower adiponectin/leptin ratio, adjusting for diet and physical activity and other potentially important confounding variables, and modifies the effects of 
adipose-derived hormones on body weight regulation, fat composition, and insulin sensitivity.  
15) Examine the associations between obesity, plasma metabolites and gut/oral microbiome. 
16) As a proof of concept examine the contributions of the oral/gut microbiome to the development of 
obesity and type 2 diabetes in sterile mice, using samples identified from in specific aim 15. 
 
 B. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/[ADDRESS_1264804] resulted —at least in part—from declining 
AEE, and small increases in AEE for individuals will prevent weight gain. In fact, neither of these conclusions is 
justified by [CONTACT_901744].  Increases in expenditure would normally be accompanied 
by [CONTACT_901745], while excess intake can be stimulated independently by [CONTACT_901746] , 
changes in food availability , and eating patterns.  As pointed out repeatedly by [CONTACT_901747] [ 17-
20], the regulation of energy stores and body composition must be seen as a complex, dynamic process  
influenced by [CONTACT_901748].  An individual ultimately uses 
both biological stimuli, via the hormones that control satiety, and social cues to achieve energy balance [ 21-
24].   Whether variation in patterns of activity observed in modern, free-living populations plays a key role in 
this process is unknown.  Since recommendations to increase AEE to reduce weight gain are at the core of current public health policy this issue deserves careful study.   
  Large shifts in chronic disease have been associated with recognizable shifts in lifestyle—for example 
cigarette smoking and lung cancer, and animal fat intake and heart disease [ 25, 26].  “Macro-level” or 
ecological relationships are, of course, subject to confounding.  However, these relationships must be present 
for an etiologic hypothesis to be correct, and their absence is a serious weakness for a hypothesis.  While lifestyle trends that increase risk of obesity are obviously taking place, it is difficult to identify clear temporal associations.  As clearly demonstrated in the trends from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System ( BRFSS), the US experienced 
an abrupt upward deviation of the trend for BMI in the mid-1980s , resulting in 
the current “obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]” [ 27] 
(Figure 1).  However, there was no 
temporally related break in activity 
patterns or eating habits [ 27].  In the 
absence of direct evidence most observers have defaulted to a “common sense” explanation that people are “eating more and exercising less”.  
Unfortunately , this formulation is both 
trivial conceptually and unsubstantiated 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675].  A more sober assessment 
was offered recently by a well -known 
obesity expert:  “Clearly some kind of change in energy balance has occurred, but we have surprisingly little 
ability to explain exactly why this has happened.  Why was BMI relatively stable and why did it begin to 
increase fairly suddenly?  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_901697], we still lack explanations supported by [CONTACT_33653], a nd we lack understanding of the mechanisms 
driving these changes ” [28].  The central purpose of our proposed project is to test whether change in 
AEE can be identified as a contributory mechanism to the population-wide weight gain, and, if so, to quantify its importance.

Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 exposure measures.  In two specialized cohorts, i.e., Nurses and Health Professionals, sub-sets of significant 
relationships were observed (e.g., TV watching and obesity, increase in vigorous PA and reduction in waist 
size) [ 29, 30].  In other prospective surveys, change in PA was an important predictor of weight change, 
explaining 4.4% of change in body weight in a [LOCATION_006] cohort [ 31] and predicting weight change in both black and 
white adults over 10 years of follow -up in CARDIA [ 32].  O ccupational activity was predictive of weight change 
in China [ 31].  An older review of 16 prospective, observational studies examining the role of PA in the 
prevention of weight gain among white males found inconsistent results : 3 studies reported an inverse 
association between baseline PA and weight change, 2 showed a positive association, 4 reported an inverse 
association between follow -up PA and weight change, and 7 had no association [ 33].  In addition, other recent 
large community studies have shown no association [34, 35].  Questionnaires are both insensitive and 
potentially biased instruments .  A RECENT COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF VALIDATION STUDIES FOUND 
THAT ON AVERAGE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN AEE BY [CONTACT_901749] ~ 0.2  
(Neilson et al) .  The challenge in this field is clearly to move toward objective measurement tools. 
  DLW has been used in 4 observational and longitudinal studies with a minimum follow -up of 12 months  
in adults ( cf. Appendix A, Table 3) [ 36-39].  Only 3 of these studies —including two of our own—examined 
weight gain in a population sample [ 36, 38, 39].  While all three studies found an association between AEE and 
body composition at baseline, variation in AEE did not predict future weight change.  These results are similar 
to our larger pi[INVESTIGATOR_901698] (cf. Preliminary Studies).  Some 
interventional studies, focusing on the risk of 
regaining weight after dieting, have suggested that higher AEE is preventive [ 40, 41].  
Accelerometers, either alone or in combination with heart rate monitors, have so far received 
limited attention in population studies  of this 
question.  While several studies have quantified 
activity, none have yet reported longitudinal results.   A varied literature also exists among children using these methods, with similarly 
equivocal results (cf. Appendix  A, Table 4 for 
summary ).  To our knowledge, at the present 
time there are no data using objective 
measurements that permit the “macro-level” or ecological hypothesis of AEE versus obesity to be tested.   
  The question framed in this section is at the 
heart of our proposal , and therefore we want to 
be certain it is stated with complete clarity.  For sake of emphasis, we repeat the key point.  Whether or not 
variation in AEE by [CONTACT_901750] a fundamental biological and public health question.  Under normal circumstances increased activity stimulates increased energy intake which allows the organism 
to remain in balance.  At the present time the “accepted wisdom” states that AEE added to a daily life routine of 
humans will reduce the risk of obesity.  In fact, the available data do not support that “optimistic” view.  For 
example, in a recent well controlled clinical trial involving 468 overweight or obese women, graded increases in exercise led to highly consistent increases in fitness, but did not result in participant weight loss  [42].  This 
result is consistent with the general finding in the literature on this question which shows that increased AEE  
without intentional calorie restriction does not reduce weight [ 43-45]. 
  Further, it is repeatedly stated that the environment of modern society is “obes ogenic” in part because 
of the greatly reduced need for physical exertion [ 46-48].   Once again, while it seems “self evident” that 
industrialized societies require less AEE across a range of domains, the empi[INVESTIGATOR_901699].  As summarized in a recent review of the world’s literature, “ The seemingly obvious 
conclusion that energy expenditure is systematically higher in Third World countries is  not supported by [CONTACT_901751]…  (Based on a review of the data) we conclude, therefore, that there are no systematic differences in 
the level of habitual activity between developed and developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696] ” [49].   Figure 2 . Mean BMI in 5 Countries of African Origin,

Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/[ADDRESS_1264806].  In the US, this inflection point is sharply defined at 1985 (cf, Figure 1) [ 27].  In 
Norway, for example, the upturn occurred around 1990 [ 50].  Many developi[INVESTIGATOR_901700], which in turn have led to an abrupt up-turn in the prevalence of CV risk factors and diabetes. Trend data analyses of longitudinal cohorts in Nigeria, Jamaica, and the US 
demonstrate that while they all gained weight during follow -up, the rate of change varied markedly  with the 
steepest slope in Jamaica (0.4 kg/y in Nigeria vs. 1.4 kg/y in Jamaica) [ 51].  The 5 countries selected for our 
study span the full range of the obesity spectrum (Figure 2).  The rapi[INVESTIGATOR_901701].  We would therefore expect that the risk relationships would be 
most clearly delineated in that setting.    B.4 Trends in Physical Activity – The Critical Unmeasured Variable  
   While in the US we have very good data on obesity prevalence beginning in the 1960’s, there are no 
comparable population-level trends in AEE or total EE [31].  Trends in occupation and transportation clearly 
suggest declining activity, however , this trend has been going on for over three-quarters of a century in 
industrialized countries while the upturn in obesity is much more recent [ 31].  Data from a recent WHO project 
on a subset of African countries demonstrate an emerging relationship between questionnaire-based levels of 
inactivity and obesity (Figure 3); while intriguing, these results are driven primarily by [CONTACT_901752].   
Questionnaires, as the sole direct source of information, are clearly limited.  For example, data from the US 
suggest that leisure-time AEE has increased 
consistently since [ADDRESS_1264807] doubled [52].  Belatedly, we have come to 
recognize that surveillance for  AEE will be crucial to 
unravel the causes of this epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], and it must be conducted using objective measures.   
A recent comprehensive review by a panel of 
experts advising the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) highlighted the importance of this missing 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_901702].  First, they noted that while reduced activity and increased consumption have obviously fueled the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], “the decrease in energy expenditure over the last 
decade and its contribution to the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901703]”  [53].  The second missing data item, in 
many ways the complement of the first, will also be 
addressed by [CONTACT_15365]:  “Insufficient data are available to 
determine the amount of physical activity needed for the primary prevention of weight gain” [ 53].  An estimate of this 
“permissive minimum,” which we view as being analogous 
to the “recommended daily allowance” of nutrients, is 
needed to guide public health policy and recommendations.  We highlight these issues because of our near -universal experience that many in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901704] a novelty or specialty tool rather than a robust measurement technique that could be more widely used in population research.  We are proposing, to the contrary, that an important new set of 
questions can be addressed with systematic use of these tools.  Given the dramatic decrease in cost for DLW, 
this is a particularly propi[INVESTIGATOR_901705].    
Figure 3 . Physical Inactivity and Obesity in the 
AFRO Region 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/[ADDRESS_1264808] rests on the assertion that epi[INVESTIGATOR_901706].  Questionnaires are both limited in scope—because they focus on sub-domains, such as leisure activity —and biased, because a sedentary lifestyle has taken on increasingly 
negative social connotations and will influence responses  [54, 55].   The only technique that measures total EE 
directly in free living people relies on stable isotopes, i .e., doubly labeled water (DLW).  Total EE is the sum of 
resting EE and voluntary PA.  The [ADDRESS_1264809] of food, is only about 10% of EE in adults 
and thus numerically minor.  Subtracting resting EE and a fixed estimate of the thermic effect of food yields EE 
in PA.  Resting EE can be measured using a metabolic cart or estimated from lean body mass (cf. Methods for details).  In contemporary populations , variation in time spent standing or “fidgeting” may therefore be a major 
contributor to non-resting EE, and it cannot be measured with questionnaires [ 56].  Recent data from Health 
ABC, a NIH -sponsored study of the elderly that was one of the first to use DLW in an epi[INVESTIGATOR_901707], 
demonstrates the value added by [CONTACT_155359].  In that cohort, questionnaires captured much less than half of the variation in AEE [ 55].   
 The Health ABC  study  also demonstrates the potential value of objective measurement of AEE as an 
exposure variable.  Among the [ADDRESS_1264810] ratio for all -cause 
survival was 0.3 in the top vs. bottom tertiles of EE [55] ; this large survival advantage was not captured by [CONTACT_382692], demonstrating the enormous gain in information observed when objective, precise measures 
are applied.  
 Considerable effort has now been invested in making better accelerometers and validating them 
against DLW.  In preparation for this grant we conducted a comprehensive review of the published literature (see Appendix  A, Table 1).  The current generation of triaxial accelerometers is now sensitive, robust and easy 
to use.  Based on 4 separate studies (total n = 91), the weighted correlation between kcal/day from the 
accelerometer and DLW was 0.62 (see Appendix A, Table 2) [ 57-60] .  On -going methodological work (c f 
D.4.1.1) should further improve precision and make it feasible to move this research forward rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].  
  Data on energy intake (EI), and as well as macronutrient composition (eg, % of calories from fat, 
carbohydrate and protein) are also important for assess ing energy balance. Measurement of intake in free-
living people can be difficult, however  [61-67] .  Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) are known to have 
important limitations, both in estimation of total calories and composition [ 68].  Furthermore, no single FFQ 
would be appropriate for our heterogeneous populations.  Multiple twenty -four hour recalls are therefore the 
best option for international comparisons, even though they are labor -intensive [69-72 ].  Energy adjustment will 
also improve estimation of composition [ 68, 73].  Likewise, intake of manufactured foods, soda, etc, which are 
measured with less error may be key aspects of an obesogenic environment, especially in the context of 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_901708] . 
 
B.6 Rationale for the Proposed Study Design 
   In our experience, s tudying AEE to gain insight into the pathogenesis of obesity remains controversial.  
We therefore describe explicitly the logic of the hypothesis testing we propose.   As noted, energy balance can 
be described in a simple equation with two variables, viz, in a weight stable individual  energy intake = energy 
expenditure ( EI = EE).  How energy stores are actually regulated, and correspondingly dysregulated in obesity, 
is much more complicated, however.  For most individuals, obesity results from the gradual accumulation of 
excess energy stores over many years.  In the US, average weight gain is ~1.5– 2.0 lbs/year, which is 
equivalent to an excess of ~30 kcal/day  [74].  This can result from excess intake, reduced expenditure, or a 
combination of the two.  The rationale for this project is based on the assumption that persons with low levels of AEE are, on average, at increased risk of accumulating excess energy  stored as fat.  About 70% of total EE 
is required for resting metabolism and there is relatively  little variation in resting metabolic rate/kg among 
people; AEE accounts for most of the between-person variation.  Alternatively of course, since weight gain represents the final balance of EI and EE, consistent over -consumption could also be a co-factor or the 
determining factor.  Assuming both are operative, persons in the quadrant of “low AEE”, “high EI” would be at 
the highest risk.  EI is difficult to measure in free-living people.  The hypothesis  which  can be rigorously tested, 
because precise, objective measures are available, is whether baseline PA is related to future change in 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 weight.  Since EE and EI are not perfectly balanced (if they were there would be no change in weight over 
time) , EE will have a separate, independent influence on change in energy stores.  Given that AEE is a highly 
stable trait (cf. Section C), persistence of low AEE will lead to future increase in weight, and this can occur in 
combination with, but independent of, excess E I.   
  We acknowledge that the energy balance models presented here are simplified to allow valid 
hypothesis testing.  We submit, however, that the basi c model is no different from established risk factor 
mechanisms.  Thus, a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol leads to a gradual increase in serum LDL over 
a lifetime, independent of other modifying factors and without the assumption that diet composition continues 
to change over time.  The same logic applies to the impact of a high salt diet on blood pressure.  In our 
framework low AEE is therefore being  characterized as a classic chronic disease lifestyle risk factor.  AEE 
should be detectable as a risk factor  when measured with precision in an adequately powered sample.   
 B.7  Rationale for Cross -Population or “Ecological” Studies  
   We have now missed the historical moment when obesity risk factors changed in the US.  By [CONTACT_901753], we can compress the time dimension and model this transition with standard epi[INVESTIGATOR_19185].  In the past, this “population as the unit of analysis” design has made crucial contributions to research in common disease.  The key role of nutrition as the 
underlying cause of the CHD epi[INVESTIGATOR_901709] [ 75].  The “Seven 
Countries Study” subsequently demonstrated the relationship of individual nutrients to atherosclerosis [75-78] .  
“Intersalt” employed a similar design to study mineral intake and blood pressure [ 79, 80], and our recently 
completed “International Collaborative Study on Hypertension in Blacks” (ICHSHIB) used population 
comparisons to examine a broad range of risk factors and physiologic processes in hypertension (cf C.2.3)  
[81].  Similar studies have suggested etiologic factors for breast, colon and stomach cancer. The study 
proposed here will extend this methodology into the area of obesity for the first time.  The advantages and 
disadvantages of this design are outlined in general terms in the section below  and in more detail under 
Methods (Section D).   Descriptive epi[INVESTIGATOR_901710].  For many “common source” diseases, however, methodological problems 
undermine its effectiveness.  Within a homogeneous society some degree of exposure may be universal, and 
the relevant quantitative variation can be hard to characterize. This is often complicated by [CONTACT_901754]-person 
relative to between-person variation in the exposures which makes person-level analyses imprecise.  The large 
contrasts obtained by [CONTACT_901755].  For example, in ICSHIB low correlations were noted 
between BMI and Na with BP at the individual level (.01-. 15); however, these rose to 0.85 when populations 
were the unit of analysis.  As with all study designs, however, there are trade-offs in cross -cultural studies.  For 
example, a concern sometimes raised is the “ecologic fallacy,” whereby [CONTACT_19313]-level relationships are falsely inferred to be causal at the individual level [ 82].  We are well aware of this potential threat and address it 
further in the analytic section of the Methods.  W ith consistency at both levels and control for confounding, 
however, these relationships can be inferred with confidence.   Likewise, once a strong hypothesis has been 
established, larger within-population studies can be justified.  
 B.8  Adipocytokines, Appetite Hormones and Regulation of Body Fat Stores.   
  Once considered metabolically  inert, adipose tissue has now been shown to secrete multiple cytokine 
hormones [83-85] .   In addition, other components of the system that regulates body fat stores have been 
identified [21, 86].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_901711], from this long list—which includes, among others, leptin, 
adiponectin, ghrelin, resistin, visfatin, omentin, NPY3, serum amyloid A, TNF-α , RBP 4, IL-6 , IL-10 —only for the 
first 3 is there reasonable evidence of a physiologic function in regulating fat mass or influencing EE [ 22, 87, 
88].  Leptin accurately reflects fat mass, and, while not an “adipostat”, appears to function at the lower range to 
prevent depletion of calorie reserves [89].  Adiponectin is a potent insulin sensitizing agent, and in prospective 
studies —including our own—it predicts onset of glucose intolerance [ 90, 91].  Surprisingly , adiponectin is not 
higher in women than men despi[INVESTIGATOR_901712], and it varies  cross -culturally with BMI [92], suggesting a 
more complex role that has not yet been defined.  Ghrelin, which is secreted by [CONTACT_275247], clearly 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 contributes to appetite control but is more complex to study in observational cohorts [ 93, 94].  Although data in 
the literature are inconsistent as to whether or not these hormones, in concert with insulin, play a role in the 
regulation of energy balance [ 95-103] , four recent studies suggest associations with EE independent of body 
composition for all three, adiponectin, leptin and ghrelin [ 104-107], and we will measure them in all subjects.  
Additional inter -relations  to EE from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_901713] C below.   
 
B.9 Summary  
 
Although the “obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]” has received enormous attention in recent years, the mechanisms 
through which the energy budget is being perturbed are still not well understood.  In particular, the role of declining AEE as a causal mechanism in population-wide increases in relative weight deserves  much greater 
attention.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_901714] (as opposed to voluntary increases in high-intensity activity, as typi[INVESTIGATOR_901715]) is correlated with change in wei ght, the data do not 
support this conclusion.  Research in this vital area has been handicapped by [CONTACT_901756].  A new generation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_901716].  As with other chronic CVD, international comparisons could be particularly informative.   
The test of our study hypothesis will be “two-sided”.  That is to say, the presence or absence of an 
association can be given a clear interpretation.  Of course, given the body of evidence that increased AEE has health advantages, absence of an association would not be taken to suggest that AEE is of no value.  Rather, the correct interpretation would be that declining AEE is unlikely to be the driving force behind the rise in 
obesity, nor will modest increases in AEE be adequate to reverse the trends.

the largest cross -cultural application of DLW to population samples.  As part of a related project, she has 
collected resting EE data on 2,500 individuals in  Nigeria, Jamaica, and the US—the largest such sample ever 
studied [114, 121] .   
In Chicago she has supervised studies enrolling more than 2,[ADDRESS_1264812] [ 118].  The project is designed to assess EE and intake 
in both rural and urban older adults using the DLW method and their relationship to parameters of glucose tolerance in populations at elevated risk of diabetes.

GPAQ is to obtain internationally comparable data on self-reported, health-related AEE done in the past 7 
days.  The correlation for activity EE (kcal/d) between the G PAQ and the accelerometer, r = 0.51 (p<0.002),

Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 C.2.2.2   Physical Activity and Weight Change 
 
The Loyola-Ibadan Women’s Study was initiated in 2000 to study the relationship between resting EE, 
AEE, and weight change in women from two contrasting social settings.  In both metropolitan Chicago and 
rural Nigeria, women were enrolled in a longitudinal survey in which EE was measured at baseline using DLW, and weight and body composition were measured for 3 consecutive years ( Table 3) [135].  Mean change in 
weight during the follow- up interval was 0.73 and 0.76 kg/y for the Nigerian and US women, respectively.  
Contrary to our hypothesis, no association was observed between activity EE at baseline and weight change in 
either site [ 136].  This result underscores our prior assertion that variation in AEE in free-living populations has 
not been convincingly shown to predict risk of obesity.  Unfortunately, the sample size in this cohort is 
somewhat small, and we were limited to two sites.   
 
C.2.[ADDRESS_1264816] correlation between resting EE and BP.  This observation was subsequently confirmed in a total sample of 1,567 individuals from independent samples in Nigeria, Jamaica and the US [ 121].  Resting EE is in turn 
strongly correlated with weight and BMI, since adiposity leads to an obligatory increase in muscle mass required for movement.  Multivariate analysis subsequently confirmed, however, that the impact of resting EE 
on BP is independent of BMI and weight.  In fact, no measures of adiposity remain significant after accounting for resting EE [ 121].  This observation suggests that at least one important mechanism by [CONTACT_901763].  To further test this hypothesis, we recently completed a person-level meta-analy sis of body composition and BP in 18,072 
individuals from the populations we propose to include in this study [ 137].  Persons at the upper end of the BMI 
distribution have higher percent body fat, thus a unit increase in BMI leads to a smaller increase in lean mass than a comparable increase in BMI among the lean.  Under the assumption that it is the increase in lean mass  
that influences BP, the slope of the BMI-BP relationship should be steeper among the lean.  In meta-regression analysis of [ADDRESS_1264817], observed a strong negative relationship between 
mean BMI and slope of the BMI-BP correlation for  both SBP and DBP (p < 0.001).  This relationship had never 
been detected in studies of individual populations and demonstrates the value of studies that sample from a 
broad range of social contexts.  Using this international comparative design, we have also detected novel 
relationships between BMI and physiologic variables (e.g., leptin and angiotensinogen) as well as impacts of environmental factors on the heritability of common 
traits (e.g., height, BP, and BMI) [137].   We have also 
reported on the relationship between PA, measured 
using DLW, and blood pressure; in a small sample of Nigerian, Jamaican, and African-American adults, activity EE, independent of body size or composition, 
was found to be inversely associated with both SBP 
and DBP [48]. 
The Loyola-Ibadan’s Women’s Study allowed us 
to examine the relationship between components of the 
energy budget and hormones and cytokines associated with obesity and glucose homeostasis.  Along with 
measurements of total, resting and activity EE, fasting 
blood samples were obtained from the women in both 
rural Nigeria and suburban Maywood.  Among the significant associations recorded was an inverse association between activity EE and fasting insulin after controlling for body size and composition among the Maywood women (r=- 0.24, p<0.05), but none among the Nigerian women.  This lack of association among the Nigerian 
women is likely due to the relatively modest variability in insulin levels compared to the Maywood cohort (10±6 vs 24±19 μU/mL).  As can be observed in Figure 5, the distribution of insulin concentrations is much narrower 
among the Nigerian than the US women.  These data illustrate the obvious  importance of AEE in maintenance

leptin (p<0.005) and adiponectin (p<0.05) concentrations in both cohorts of women after controlling for body 
composition and age.  In addition, resting EE was inversely associated with ghrelin in  the Nigerian cohort 
(p<0.01).  These observations require confirmation.  It has been hypothesized that high adiponectin may be 
protective of the increased risk of obesity that theoretically accompanies low resting EE [106], however, our 
group demonstrated recently that there was no association between low resting EE and subsequent weight gain[ 138].  This preliminary data does  suggest a strong link between hormones and the energy budget and 
deserve further investigation in larger samples .

significant experience in the collection and analysis of 24-hour recall and FFQ  data with analysis completed 
using the Nutrient Data System for Research (NDSR)  [139-141] .  In Nigeria, until very recently a nutrient 
database specific to Nigerian foods was not available and thus dietary analysis was limited to foods and food patterns; a site-specific database is now available and nutrient analyses will be conducted on previ ously 
collected 24 -hour recalls  [142].  In the Seychelles, our co-investigator has been working with dietitians at the 
Ministry of Health to create and validate a nutrient database specific to Seychelles using the [LOCATION_006] system, WISP  
(personal communication, S. Romain & P. Bovet)  [143, 144].   In South Africa, our new co-investigator [CONTACT_901808], has extensive experience with dietary intake measurement at the national level  [145] and developed a 
system  with colleagues at the MRC to improve estimation of portion sizes, the Dietary Assessment and

D.1.1  Participant Recruitment and Baseline Exam  
 
  Population- based samples, ages 25 -45, will be drawn from communities in 5 countries: Nigeria, 
Seychelles, South Africa, Jamaica and the US; 500 per site, 2500 total.  Based on our overall experience with 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 longitudinal studies, we experienced 2% annual attrition in Nigeria and 10% in the US site, we anticipate no 
more than 20% attrition by [CONTACT_941] 24-month examination, resulting in a final ‘N’ of at least 400 per site (Table 5).    
 
D.1.2 Hypotheses to be Tested  
 
1) PA is negatively related to percent body fat in the study populations at baseline, independent of dietary  
intake.  
2) PA is negatively related to change in body weight during follow -up, independent of dietary intake.  
3) Mean levels of AEE are negatively related to mean levels of obesity/relative weight among the populations.  
4)  Adipocytokines and hormones influence weight regulation and insulin sensitivity and interact with AEE.

with accelerometer  and body composition measurements at 24 months of follow -up.  Laboratory analyses of 
the DLW samples will commence at approximately year 1.  Deuterium analyses for body composition 
assessments will be conducted in years 1 and 4.  Fasting hormone and glucose samples will be collected at 
the baseline examination and stored at -80C; the samples will be analyzed in year 4.  Primary data analysis

 D.3 Clinic Overview  
 
D.3.1 Clinic Examinations and Data Acquisition  
 
  Each of the sites has been conducting community -based CV research and has community -centered 
clinics from which the present study will be based (see below).  For participants enrolled in the DLW/deuterium  
protocol, the initial clinic examination will last approximately 4 hours.  They will return to the clinic, or be visited 
by a staff member at their home, on day 5 (± 1 day) to provide a midpoint urine sample and to ensure the 
accelerometer is comfortable and being worn properly.  They will be asked to return to the clinic on day 9 (± 1 day) to provide a final urine sample and have the accelerometer removed. For the participants enrolled in the accelerometer protocol, the clinic examination will last approximately [ADDRESS_1264823], occupation, education, tobacco use, alcohol use and pregnancy history, will also be collected at this time.  At 12 and 24 months after the baseline examination, all participants will be recontact[CONTACT_51095] -up clinic examinations.  
 D.3.2 Sampling Procedures  
   In each of the 5 sites, 75  individuals aged 25-45 years will be recruited for the DLW protocol and 425 
will be recruited for the accelerometer protocol, with equal numbers of men and women.  We will exclude 
individuals with obvious chronic or infectious diseases (including active malaria), pregnant or lactating women, 
and HIV positive individuals (see D.3.3 for HIV testing procedures).  Any individual that has a condition preventing normal  AEE will also be excluded from our study.  Population -based surveys have been carried out 
in each of the sites ; the sampling procedures used previously will be employed in the present study.  These 
study sites were chosen because mean BMIs and prevalence of obesity span the healthy physiological range.

Loyola has been engaged in collaborative research with the UCH Dept of Social & preventive Medicine since [ADDRESS_1264826] been enrolled in genetic studies  [123, 124, 126, 127].  Prior studies on EE and obesity have been carried out in this 
community.    Seychelles – The Republic of Seychelles is an archipelago with 81,[ADDRESS_1264827] shown increasing prevalence of several cardiovascular risk 
factors in the adult population [ 146, 147].  The sampling method will be a sex - and age-stratified random 
sample generated from the national census.   
 
South Africa – Khayelitsha, the [ADDRESS_1264828] a population-based 5-year prospective study on AEE and diabetes in 1000 members of this  urban community.  A sex - and age-stratified random sample will 
be generated from the national census.   
 D.3.3   HIV Testing in South Africa 
   The prevalence of HIV in the rural regions of Nigeria in which this study will be conducted is less than 
2% [148], and less than 1% in the Seychelles [ 149]; however, the prevalence is as high as 12% in the Western 
Cape, South Africa [ 150].  The hyper -metabolic state produced by [CONTACT_901765].  In order to eliminate the impact of HIV infection, we will work with the community health clinics  in South Africa in which study enrollment will take place.  All participants 
will be tested for HIV and undergo pre- and post -test counseling both before study enrollment at baseline and 
again at follow -up (cf. E.2.[ADDRESS_1264829] Risk ).  The officials at LifeLine Clinic in Khayelitsha, CapeTown, 
have agreed to counsel, test, and treat all participants in the screening process of this study.  All the above 
options are free of charge in South Africa as a result of both national and international efforts.  HIV -positive 
individuals will be excluded from our study.   
  
D.4 Measurement Procedures 
 
D.4.1 Activity  Energy Expenditure 
 Total daily EE is comprised of three components: resting EE, AEE, and thermic effect of food.  In this 
study, we are most interested in AEE and its relationship to weight change and insulin sensitivity.  AEE will be measured by [CONTACT_392577]: accelerometers and DLW.  All participants in each site will wear an activity monitor for 6-9 days, while a subset will undergo the DLW procedure as well.  Our previous experience with 
measurement of EE indicates that both resting EE and AEE are very stable traits, with within-person correlations of 0.9 and 0.8 at intervals of 1-2 years, respectively [ 135].   For those participants in the DLW 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/[ADDRESS_1264830] of food will be estimated as 10% 
of total daily EE.  All methods are described below.   
 
D.4.1.1 Physical Activity by [CONTACT_901766] (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770] /Mini -Mitter , Bend, OR) with all 
participants.  Previous studies have shown that accelerometer -based activity monitors can discriminate 
differing intensities of activity [151 -156], making it possible to adequately characterize each of the study 
communities with regard to overall intensity of PA.  We will record the data as activity counts/min and kcal/d.  
The activity monitor records the intensity, duration and frequency of physical motion through the use of an accelerometer which produces a variable electrical current based on the combination of the amplitude and frequency of motion.  Accelerometers are omnidirectional  motion sensors that count the vertical and horizontal 
acceleration of the user.  This information is stored within the instrument as activity counts per epoch, or 
specified subunit of time, e.g ., per minute.  As the intensity of the activity increases, so does the number of 
activity counts per epoch.  The Actical monitor is lightweight, waterproof and made to be worn on the wrist, 
waist or ankle.  Consistent placement of the activity monitor ensures comparability of data.  For this study , the 
monitor will be worn at the waist.  There are concerns about the ability of the accelerometer to discriminate between some activities with differing energy expenditures, eg, stair climbing versus level walking.  As 
described below, our consultants are developi[INVESTIGATOR_901722].   
There is controversy over the number of days of recording needed to adequately capture habitual 
activity levels; the suggested range is from  4 to 9 days [152] .  We used the Spearman -Brown prophecy formula 
with calculated, site-specific intraclass correlation coefficients [ 157] to estimate the level of reliability achieved 
for a given number of days of monitoring in each site (Figure 7) [152].  Most studies use 0.8 as an acceptable 
level of reliability [ 152, 158 -161] .  For our data, all sites achieve this level with five days of monitoring (ie, 
excluding the first and last partial days of monitoring which are dropped from analysis), however the 
Seychelles are on the borderline.  Given the practicality of six days of monitoring (i.e., participants will receive 
the monitor and return the monitor on the same day of the week), we have chosen to monitor all participants 
for six days (i.e., a total of 8 after taking the two partial days into consideration).  With six days of monitoring, the expected level of reliability will be 0.83-0.92.   
The Actical activity monitor will be initialized 
for each participant on the morning of the initial clinic examination, using the on-site computer.  The participant’s ID , epoch period (1 minute), start 
date and time, and mode will be entered into the main program.  Use of the activity monitor will be 
explained to the  participant: the participant will be 
asked to wear the activity monitor at all times over the next 8 days, including during sleep; the only 
time the monitor should be removed is while bathing, showering, or swimming.  The activity 
monitor will be placed on the participant on a belt at the waist, positioned just behind the left hip bone.  The participant will be trained in proper handling of the accelerometer, including removal and placement of the monitor on the belt as well as placement of the belt on the body, in order to ensure accurate measurements.  If the participant has problems 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_901723], they will be encouraged to remove it during sleep hours.  An additional belt will be 
provided in case it gets wet and needs to be swapped out.  Staff members will contact [CONTACT_117442] 24 
hours after the initiation of the monitoring session to ensure that there is no discomfort with the monitors.  In addition, the monitor will be checked at the midpoint home or clinic visit to ensure proper placement and recording.  On day 8, each participant will return to the clinic , and the staff member will verify end date and 
time and download the data.  Data will be presented as activity counts per minute for the whole day and during hours the participant is awake, as well as kcal/day or METs/wk in AEE as calculated using the ac companying 
software [153, 155, 156, 162, 163].   Figure 7. Levels of Reliability Achieved for a Given Number of

Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/[ADDRESS_1264831] had extensive experience with several models of accelerometers, activity 
monitors , and heart rate monitoring devices.  Missing data is a well -documented problem with activity monitors 
in general and can result from instrument failure or non-compliance of the participant, i.e. , the monitor is simply 
removed for part of the measurement period.  In our experience, all cases of truncated data collection (which 
occurred in less than 2% of participants) had at least [ADDRESS_1264832] demonstrated that converting the output from 
accelerometry to units of acceleration (in m/s
2) from counts provides substantial additional information by 
[CONTACT_901767] [ 130].  After adjustment for  built-in  frequency filtering by [CONTACT_901768] , acceleration is linearly associated with activity counts , as well as with EE.  Brage and Ekelund are also 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_901724] s and other mathematical approaches  to improve the 
accuracy of accelerometer data, particularly with regard to recognition of patterns of activity that allow further 
differentiation among activities.  The DLW data from this project will therefore help improve the accuracy of accelerometery as a tool in survey research, while improving the precision of the data collected in our project.      
 D.4.1.[ADDRESS_1264833] AEE assessed by [CONTACT_63496], in their own language, using the Global 
Physical Activity Questionnaire version 2 (GPAQ) [ 164].  The GPAQ was developed by [CONTACT_67848] (WHO) as part of the WHO STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk -factor surveillance 
(STEPS manual available online at http://www.who.int/chp/steps/manual/en/) [ 165] to produce reliable and 
valid estimates of physical activity for use in culturally diverse populations in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696].  Approximately 50 developi[INVESTIGATOR_901725].  The 
main outcome variables are: a categorical variable of total physical activity (high, moderate and low) and a continuous variable of total physical activity within each domain of work, transport and leisure.   
 D.4.2 Body Composition  
 
D.4.2.2  Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis  
 
Body composition will also be assessed in all participants using BIA.  BIA measures the impedance to 
the flow of an applied mild alternating current by [CONTACT_749134].  The measured impedance of body tissues can 
be used to calculate total body water, from which fat-free mass and fat mass can be calculated [170] .  BIA is a 
relatively inexpensive method to estimate body composition in populations.   
The participants will be placed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_901726].  Current-supplying electrodes 
will be placed on the dorsal surfaces of the right hand and foot at the metacarpals and metatarsals, respectively.  Detection electrodes will be placed at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_901727] [ 170].  The single-frequency instrument (BIA Quantum, RJL Systems, Clinton 
Township, MI) will be attached to electrodes and generate an excitation current of [ADDRESS_1264834] developed equations for use in Nigerian, Jamaican and African-American adult and child 
populations [112, 119].  Unless evidence from the ID  analyses, described above, indicates a need for the 
development of separate equations for the other African sites, we propose to use the pre-existing validated BIA equations.  The ID  data will be used to calibrate BIA for change in body composition within individuals over the 
2-year follow -up.  
 D.4.2.3 Dual X -ray Absorptiometry (DXA)  
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 Participants will undergo a bone mineral density measurement using dual x -ray absorptiometry (DXA).  
The bone scan takes approximately [ADDRESS_1264835] balance (Health-o-meter, Bridgeview, IL).  Height will be measured using a stadiometer without shoes and head held in the Frankfort plane to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_1264836] measurement will be taken.  
   
D.4.4 Dietary Intake 
 
 Dietary intake is not the primary focus of this application, however, we recognize that estimates of 
EI and diet composition data may improve the analysis of energy balance.  We are cognizant of the challenges 
involved in comparing dietary intake across multiple populations [ 69-72, 171].  Using both INTER -MAP and 
EPIC as models, we will attempt to collect and measure dietary intake, with appropriate quality control 
measures, in these [ADDRESS_1264837]. Steyn at the Medical Research Council 
(MRC) of South Africa.  [CONTACT_901809] has extensive experience in assessing the diets of multiple countries in sub-
Saharan Africa [ 145, 172-175], and has developed a system for portion size estimation in collaboration with a 
MRC colleague which has been utilized in South Africa and Kenya (DAEK, [ 176]).  Quality control measures 
will include centralized training for all interviewers led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Steyn (cf. section D.5); training will include 
discussion and documentation of site -specific prompts and portion sizes for the dietary interviews,  decision on 
standardized coding of the recalls , and methods for the audiotape recording of the interviews.  We will use the 
five indicators suggested by [CONTACT_901769]:  evaluation of audiotapes, number of 
foods coded, coding error rates, duration of the recall and total energy intake (kcal or kJ) per recall [171].  [CONTACT_901808] and/or  a post-doctoral fellow will  travel to each during pi[INVESTIGATOR_901728].  The Nutrient Data System for Research (NDSR; U. Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) will be modified 
and utilized for nutrient analysis.  The first year will be spent setting up the NDSR to accommodate those foods/recipes local to each site using the currently available site-specific nutrient databases and the previously 
collected 24 -hour recall data (cf. Table 4).  In the 3 African countries, this will not be an excessive number of 
foods – eg, in Nigeria only 75 different foods/food mixtures  mentioned in over [ADDRESS_1264838] recall conducted at the midpoint urine sample collection.  With 
these multiple recalls, usual intake distributions of nutrients c an be estimated (cf. Section D.7.1.3; [ 177-179]. At 
each site, the 24-hour recalls will be collected by [CONTACT_901770]; an audiotape recording will also be made of the recall interviews and used to augment the written record where necessary , 
as well as for quality control.  The [ADDRESS_1264839] will be total EI and macronutrient composition (ie, % kcals from fat, carbohydrate and protein), as well as indicators of intake of processed foods 
(ie, # of sweetened beverages, pre-packaged foods and restaurant fast foods per day) and of intake of fruits, 
vegetables and site-specific staples (cf. Table 4).  While we recognize the importance of micronutrients for 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 overall health and well -being of individuals, many nutrient databases are lacking sufficient data on local food 
micronutrient content.    
 
D.4.4 Blood Pressure 
 
Blood pressure will be measured using the protocol and training procedures developed for our ongoing 
international hypertension studies.  Blood pressure will be measured using the Omron Automatic Digital Blood Pressure Monitor (model HEM -747Ic, Omron Healthcare, Bannockburn, IL, [LOCATION_003]).  With the antecubital fossa 
at heart level, three pulse and blood pressure readings will be taken.

lavender -top (adipocytokines, ghrelin and insulin) and one 5-mL grey -top vacutainer (glucose) will be drawn for 
fasting blood samples.  The blood samples will be processed and plasma separated within two hours of collection and stored at - 20C (in the field) and -80C in the laboratory.  Plasma will be aliquotted into 6 cryovials.  
Fasting plasma glucose will be measured using the glucose oxidase method at each site at the time of 
collection using the instrument available in each collaborator’s laboratory.  Two vials will be shipped or carried 
with the PI, along with the DLW samples, to Loyola for the assays.  Insulin, total ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin 
will be measured using RIA kits (Linco Research, Inc., St. Charles, MO).  In addition, a small plasma aliquot 
will be shipped to the Swedish Metabolomics Unit for metabolite analysis from all 2,500 participants.  The analysis will focus on known, as well as novel metabolites linked to obesity and type two diabetes mellitus.  Again, samples from all sites will be batched together, and blinded replicates will be included.  Our experience with the insulin and leptin RIA indicates an intra- assay CV of < 8%, ghrelin is <6% and adiponectin is ~9%.   The

D.4.6 Mouse model  
Following the identification of obesity -
 related fecal/oral microbiome in the METS participant samples, and as a 
proof of research concept, fecal/oral microbiome samples, collected in D.4.5, will be transplanted in sterile 
mice, who will be evaluated for the development of adiposity and type [ADDRESS_1264842] been approved by [CONTACT_473], a

responsible for training and certification on the dietary intake methods.      D.6 International Transport of Samples 
 
International shipment of biological samples has become complicated by [CONTACT_901771].  Based 
on prior experience, it has been decided that samples to the US, i.e., DLW and plasma samples, will be carried by [CONTACT_901772]/from the annual investigator meeting if there is evidence of problems with shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], e.g., from Jamaica.  After appropriate aliquotting, the samples will be packed on dry ice in insulated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_901729].  In the case of Nigeria and South Africa, no such problems have 
arisen to date; therefore, samples will be shipped directly on dry ice by [CONTACT_901773][INVESTIGATOR_901730].  For 
DLW samples transported to Loyola, they will subsequently be re-packed on dry ice and shipped overnight to the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Stable Isotope Core Laboratory.  Duplicates of all samples will be stored in the laboratories of origin.  
 
D.[ADDRESS_1264844]. Durazo.  He will generate reports on accrual, missing data 
items, and alerts (if any).  With the assistance of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_901731], he will undertake the analyses outlined below.  A data coordinating center (DCC) will be established to manage and administer data transfers between sites.  Data quality control and assurance processes will be put in place by [CONTACT_15791].  
 
D.7.1  Statistical Analysis  
 
In the initial stage of the analysis, a complete set of descriptive tables will be produced by [CONTACT_901774].  The distributional properties of each variable will be examined and appropriate re-scaling undertaken, if 
necessary.  All outliers (i.e. > 3 SD’s) will be identified and either verified as correct or set to missing.  When 
possible, internal validity will be assessed by [CONTACT_901775] (e.g., resting EE vs. BMI or weight vs. BP).  These plots provide a useful search procedure for unanticipated outliers and/or non-linear relationships.  
As in any other longitudinal study, some measurements may be unavailable in a subset of the study 
participants.  A brief description of methods used to handle non-ignorable missing data are presented at the end of this section (cf. D.7.4)  
 We describe below the analytic procedures and the power calculation, in relation to the following 4  
primary hypotheses  as stated in the Aims : 
 1)  AEE is negatively related to % body fat at baseline, independent of dietary intake . 
2)  AEE is negatively related to change in body weight during follow-up, independent of dietary intake. 
3)  Mean levels of AEE are negatively related to mean levels of obesity/relative weight among the populations.  
  4)  Adipocytokines and hormones influence weight regulation and insulin sensitivity and interact with  
  AEE.   
 D.7.1.1    Weight and Body Composition are Related to AEE at Baseline 
 D.[IP_ADDRESS]  AEE, Weight and Body Composition   
   Two measures of AEE will be available.  At baseline, we will have 500 participants/site with data from 
the accelerometer, inclusive of those who have both DLW and accelerometer (total N, all sites = 2500; 6 days 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 of monitoring).  We will have data generated by [CONTACT_901776] 75 participants/site (total N , all sites = 375).  The 
structure of the analysis will be similar with both exposure measures.   
   We anticipate that data for all the primary outcomes will not conform entirely to a normal Gaussian 
distribution .  Using BMI, PAL and AEE data collected in previous studies in Maywood (n = 567) and Nigeria (n 
= 735), we examined the probability distributions.  A formal test statistic was performed that combines kurtosis 
and skewness [ 180] as implemented in STATA with p-values less than 0.001, suggesting deviations from 
normality.  Kernel density estimates of the BMI, AEE, and PAL distributions are depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 7. After 
applying the ladder of power approach suggested by [CONTACT_397618] [ 181], we found that BMI, AEE and PAL for both 
sites appear to deviate from normality .  Although no transformation is preferred after application of the ladder 
of powers method, two potential transformations are suggested by [CONTACT_162383], namely log X and X-1.  
Tukey’s approach followed by [CONTACT_901777] a decision about data transformations has been made.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_901732], a visual explo ration of Figure 7  suggests  only slight 
deviations from normality, mostly due to well -known skewness of these distributions.  Thus, we anticipate the 
statistical methods that make use of normally distributed data will be appropriate to analyze these data.  Of course, the degree of appropriateness of these methods will depend on their robustness to deviations from normality.  If it is necessary , appropriate transformations will be carried out before statistical tests are 
performed.

Figure 7. Distribution estimates of main analysis variables BMI, AEE, and PAL in two sites: Maywood (US) and 
Nigeria.  
  Following transformation of the appropriate exposure and outcome variables , Fisher’s Z-transformation 
test will be applied in order to test hypotheses involving correlations .  The resulting parametric test will be more 
powerful than other distribution-free approaches.  The results will be corroborated by [CONTACT_901778] n [182] and later 
extended by [CONTACT_901779] [ 183].  Lin’s concordance correlation 
allows the comparison of the correlations accounting for possible differences in the mean values of the two variables under consideration.  Furthermore, approximate permutation tests [ 184, 185] will be implemented 
using each of the three statisti cs: Pearson, Spearman and Li n’s concordance, to compare agreement of the 
association between AEE and BMI across the three groups under investigation.  
  Correlation coefficients will be estimated using the Pearson correlation and confidence intervals 
constructed after applying the Fisher’s Z-transformation.  Furthermore, computer intensive statistical methods, such as bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], will be used to construct confidence intervals for both parametric and nonparametric approaches.  Comparisons of these correlations will be carried out using this  statistic for 1 and 2 samples 
[186], as well as approximate permutation tests [ 184, 185].  In addition, multivariate regression analysis will be 
fit to adjust for potential confounders.  Confounders will include age, gender, and any other significant [IP_ADDRESS].04.05Density

obtained.  We will choose one based on two approaches.  First, subject matter considerations will eliminate 
some models.  Second, a computer intensive approach based on bootstrap sampling will be implemented in a 
fashion similar to that introduced by [CONTACT_901780] [ 187] to aid automated variable selection.  
  Repeat accelerometer measures will be made in all individuals at the 2 year exam (with estimated 20% 
attrition, N=2000).   We will use these data to assess tracking of AEE levels and identify potential cross -site 
variation in seasonal effects, etc . A second measure will offer important information about potential between-
site heterogeneity that might help explain anomalous findings (i.e., weak or absent relationships at a particular 
site).  If appropriate, we could also use this data in a “regression-dilution” type of analysis that corrects for the 
underestimation of exposure-outcome effects from “noise” in individual exposure levels.)    
 D.[IP_ADDRESS]  AEE, Adipocytokines and Diabetes  
 
  We will have measures of fasting glucose and insulin, adiponectin, ghrelin and leptin on this unique 
sample of 5 populations of African origin.   The following additional variables will be collected: age, gender, 
place of birth, prior medical history, occupation, education, height, weight, activity by [CONTACT_63496], pregnancy history, and season of exam.     In the analysis phase we will first compare the descriptive characteristics in each population (e.g., mean 
adipocytokine/hormone values and prevalence of hyperglycemia).  We will explore the univariate correlation 
structure for the continuous variables listed above.  We will then construct multivariable regression models to 
assess the potential independent role of AEE as a predictor of risk factor status independent of body composition.  Risk factor status will be examined as continuous and categorical outcomes.  For instance, how is insulin level affected by [CONTACT_901781]?    An important focus of these analyses will be looking for potential heterogeneity of risk relationships 
across sites.  Three main aspects are of interest, namely whether the AEE -risk factor (e.g. insulin level) 
relationship is present, or of the same magnitude, in each sample and whether there exists co-var iation with 
the mean level of AEE; testing for interaction will be undertaken where appropriate.  Precisely,  
Relative effect of AEE on risk factor: We will examine the magnitude of the association using 1) regression 
coefficients; 2) standardized regression coefficients.  This approach allows within and between site comparisons. It is recognized that cross -site comparisons could be problematic when using standardized 
regression coefficients since the standard deviation of the variables involved may differ across sites. In this case, standardized regression coefficients will be obtained using pooled estimates of the mean and standard deviation.  
Co-variation of the association with mean level of AEE: Multilevel models will be applied, in which the site 
specific variable, mean AEE, will be used to estimate the effect of the average AEE on the regression 
coefficient.  
Interactions between AEE and site: Multiplicative interaction terms will be included in regression models to 
assess how much site modifies the association between AEE and the risk factor. We are fully aware of the lack 
of statistical power to test this type of hypotheses and thus results will be exploratory in nature.  Thus, one might anticipate that anthropometric and AEE measures are stronger in low risk population samples than in the US.  In addition, we will test whether the slope of the exposure-outcome relationships are influenced by [CONTACT_901782].  
  Questionnaire data on AEE will be summarized using methods previously developed [ 188].  Mean 
activity levels and prevalence of inactivity will be assessed in relation to objective measures of EE and the 
relevant outcome variables.  As a sub-analysis we will describe types of activities reported to assess overall population patterns.   
 D.7.1.2   AEE a nd Weight Change 
 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016   The study design contemplates 3 weight determinations over time: one at baseline, a second after 12 
months, and a final assessment 2 years after entering the study.  To better understand the associations 
between AEE and body composition, the analysis plan will be carried out in incremental steps corresponding to 
the degree of sophistication of the statistical methods used.  
1) Descriptive: Weight change is computed for each subject as the subject’s last weight minus baseline 
weight.  The correlation between weight change and AEE will be computed. 
2) Regression of weight change (as computed above) on AEE will be performed, adjusting for potential confounders of the association.  
3) AEE will be dichotomized at the median value, resulting in high and low AEE groups.  Weight change will be estimated for each individual as the slope of the regression of weight on time (0, 12, and 24 months).  Average weight change across AEE groups will be compared.  That is, individual regression lines of weight on time will be obtained for each individual, and the average regression among “Low PA” will be compared to the average regression among “High PA” subjects.  
4) Multilevel analysis (i.e., mixed effect models), which generalizes the previous methods, will be used in our final analysis.  This approach will allow for the use of all the available information (i.e., there will be no need to categorize AEE values), thus  improving the statistical power [ 189].  Furthermore, this 
method allows one to account for the within-subject correlation of the weight determinations and to account (adjust for) subject-specific covariates that may confound the associations.  In addition, the 
dependence of weight change on AEE values can be specifically modeled by [CONTACT_901783].  Specifically,

calories from fat, etc). This approach corresponds to a multivariate nutrient density method suggested in 
the literature [ 73]. The effect of type of food most frequently consumed (e.g. vegetables, industrially 
processed foods, etc) will be accounted for by [CONTACT_901784]. Note that the parameter  β1i, in the Level -[ADDRESS_1264847] 
(∆AEE i) on weight change will be assessed by [CONTACT_901785] i in the Level 2 step of the multi -level analysis 
above by (∆ AEE i). 
 Finally, one additional co-variate capturing exposure information will be created which will define the 
pattern of AEE.  After examining the within-person distribution over the monitored days (eg, within-person 
SD) we will use both continuous and categorical transformations to characterize “consistent vs variable” 
patterns.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_901733]. the US and this may 
impact on the AEE -weight relationship.    
 
D.7.1.3   Comparison of Mean AEE Levels Among Sites  
 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/[ADDRESS_1264848] will be used to compare means of the primary continuous variables, e.g., BMI, PA , 
weight, and height.  Relevant co-variates will be identified from the within-site analyses and added using 
multivariable models [ 186, 190].  We recognize that some modifying factors within sites may not have the 
same significance across sites, and we will be very careful how variables are chosen for these analyses.  
Finally, we will test whether the regression slopes of the PA -BMI relationship varies significantly among any 
pair of sites (i.e., test for interaction).   
The association between mean levels of AEE and mean levels of obesity/relative weight will be 
assessed using regression analysis, following a meta-regression type of approach.  That is, mean AEE values 
will be regressed on mean obesity/relative weight values, weighting by [CONTACT_901786] [ 191].  This is a widely -used approach in meta-analysis [192]. It is recognized 
that EI is an important potential confounder of the associations at the individual level. We will estimate the 
median (and other quantiles of the distribution) usual intake of nutrients (e.g. fat, percent fat) using methods developed by [CONTACT_901787] [ 179, 193] and include them in the meta-regression models. 
 D.7.[ADDRESS_1264849] them with sufficient power (80% or higher) will be selected.  
 
1) PA is negatively related to percent body fat and CV risk factors in the study populations at baseline. 
 It has been previously estimated (cf. Preliminary Studies) that the correlation between PA, 
measured with DLW, and body composition is between -0.6 and -0.5.  A correlation of -0.33 or smaller (larger in absolute value) will be detectable with 83% power and maximum probability of type I error alpha 
= 5% using a one-sided Fisher’s Z test and 75 subjects per site [ 194].  
 
2) PA is negatively related to change in body fat composition. 
  a)  Physical Activity Measured by [CONTACT_208187]: 
  PA, measured by [CONTACT_202537], is associated with changes in body composition.  For 
design purposes  we will use the approach described above in the analysis section (see D.7.1.2.  
method 3).  That is, two AEE groups will be formed by [CONTACT_901788]. A method developed by [CONTACT_901789] [195] will be applied to compare mean changes between 
groups in a longitudinal analysis, adjusting for baseline values.  In this method the following assumptions are made: the correlation between any 2 weight determinations is ~ 0.[ADDRESS_1264850] deviations (i.e., effect size equals 
0.25) [186].  There will be one baseline measure of weight and two follow -up measurements. An 
analysis of covariance approach will be  used to adjust for baseline values.  Thus, to detect the pre-
specified minimum difference with 90% statistical power we will need to accrue 460 subjects per AEE 
group (230 in the Low and 230 in the High group).  We will accrue a total of 500 individuals per site in 
anticipation of a conservative total attrition rate of ~ 20%.   
     b)  Physical Activity Measured by [CONTACT_901790]:   The correlation between AEE and change in body composition is anticipated to be weaker (i.e., 
smaller in absolute value) than that observed between AEE and body composition at baseline.  Data from previous studies (cf. Section C: Preliminary Studies) suggest that the association between AEE and body composition remains constant across studies.  
  Although the study is not powered to test for differences in the association across sites (i.e., 
effect modification), we will undertake this task to ensure that large differences among the correlation 
coefficients do not exist.  In addition, sites in which the correlation coefficient is deemed to be similar 
will be combined, and then comparisons of the correlations will be performed.  For the sake of 
illustration, assume that 2 sites (n = 150 individuals) are compared to other 2 sites (n = 150 individual s).  
Thus, a two-sample, one-s ided test of the correlations, assuming -0.4 versus -0.65, will yield over 91% 
power, whereas the power will be over 80% for comparison of -0.45 and -0.65, and between -0.35 and -
0.6 the power is greater than 85%. Combining the data samples from all 5 sites and assuming constant 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016 association will demonstrate a correlation between AEE and change in body composition of -0.15 or 
smaller (larger in absolute value) with over 83% power. 
 
3) Mean levels of AEE are negatively related to mean levels of obesity/relative weight among the 
populations.  
 As previously demonstrated, sample sizes within sites will allow us to rule out correlations larger 
than 0.33 (absolute value), even when AEE is determined by [CONTACT_377732].  Furthermore, we have estimated (cf. 
Preliminary Studies) that the within- site correlation between AEE and body composition of individual data 
could be as large as 0.6.  We anticipate that the correlation between mean AEE levels and mean body composition will exceed 0.85.  This estimate is justified in the following manner.  A Fisher’s Z-transformation 5% -significance test will have over 55% power to detect this correlation with 5 values 
corresponding to the 5 sites of the study.  However, after dividing our samples by [CONTACT_901791] 10 observations (2 X 5 countries), resulting in over 95% statistical power. Assuming an effective sample size 
of 7, to account for within-country correlations, the statistical power is 80%. Note that additional power will 
be gained when weighted linear regression methods are applied to estimate the correlation ( slope) 
between AEE and body composition using meta-regression.  Given the strong a prior hypothesis we can 
also compare mean AEE in the groups with the highest and lowest rates of obesity to test the ecological association.   
 In this instance, we acknowledge that we are forced to make the assumption that important 
relationships will be inherently strong statistically.  This assumption is justified since the unit of the analysis will be the average for the entire group in each site, and therefore estimated with precision.  For example, in our study of 11,000 individuals in 8 populations we demonstrated a correlation of 0.85 between mean 
BMI and prevalence of hypertension [123].  To enhance our ability to find these relationships, we have 
selected populations from across the full range of BMI (e.g., from 21-30).  We are also fully aware of the 
possibility of “ecological confounding” in these analyses.  Thus, while a strong correlation could be 
observed, the causal process could be entirely different from, but simply co-linear with, the AEE relationship.  We will guard against this outcome by [CONTACT_901792] -level relationships first, as 
discussed previously.  
 
D.7.3  Data Management  
 
  The data coordinating center (DCC) will be established in Chicago, where the study statistician and 
statistical programmers are housed.  [CONTACT_360231] has significant experience supervising DCCs.  He has maintained large data repositories on international collaborative studies at Loyola for over [ADDRESS_1264851] for the duration of the study.  All data files will be stripped from personal identifiers to ensure participant confidentiality.  Data backups will be 
performed regularly following the guidelines of the Department of Preventive Medicine IT. 
 D.7.4  Missing Data 
  Briefly, missing data will be handled statistically by [CONTACT_901793], which will (1) allow use of 
all data even if some time points are missing, (2) accommodate subject measurements that were not obtained 
at the precise time, (3) use growth curve models, which is a special case of mixed effects models, which again 
permits use of the full data set despi[INVESTIGATOR_901734] (4) allow for correlations of variables within a participant.  The mixed models approach assumes that the data is missing at random (MAR) and, as such, will not bias the analysis.  However, if it is determined that the data may not be randomly missing and thus non-ignorable, then two well accepted approaches to handle this situation will be implemented, namely selection 
models  [196, 197] and pattern mixture models  [198-201] .  Selection models  comprise to steps. In the first, a 
predictive model for drop-out (missi ngness) is developed as a function of variables measured prior to dropout 
(e.g. baseline information). Thus, the probability (propensity) of missingness is estimated for each participant. 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/[ADDRESS_1264852] selection models to account for non-ignorable missing 
data [200]. In pattern-mixture models  we first group the data according to a missing pattern. For instance, in a 
study with 3 time point determinations there will be total of 8 (23) missing data patterns (e.g. OOO, OOM, 
OMM, OMO, where O stands for observed and M for missing). Then, a mixed-effects model is fit to the data with the same covariates as the original mixed- effects model, in addition to a groupi[INVESTIGATOR_901735]-out. Formally, dummy variables are created to represent each of 
the data patterns. The final model includes all the covariates, the dummy variables and interactions of these 
dummy variables with other variables  in the model. This approach allows determi nation of i ) the degree of 
dependence of the outcome variable on the missing data patterns; ii) the extent of the influence of the missing 
data patterns on the association between other variables and outcome (effect modification). Overall estimates of the association between a given variable and outcome can be estimated by [CONTACT_901794].   
 D.[ADDRESS_1264853] 
chosen to study.  The value of our study will be in quantifying the overall magnitude of this difference and its 
within-site relationship.  We recognize that it is possible that increases in energy intake—rather than 
expenditure —could be the determining, or even sole factor, in weight gain and diabetes  risk; demonstrating the 
absence of a PA-obesity relationship will directly support this alternative hypothesis.  We will capture data on EI from questionnaires as well, although we recognize its limitations. 
On the other hand, the net positive energy balance required to cause gradual weight gain can be quite 
subtle (in the range of 20-40 kcal/d for adults).  Given that this net excess is likely to be due to a combination of both decreased AEE and increased caloric intake, the contrast in population means for  AEE could be hard to 
define.  As in all such etiologic studies, therefore, we run the risk of a false negative due to low power.  This result, however, would not be uninformative since it would be important to know that large mean shifts in AEE 
were not driving this epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].  At the same time, a wide distribution of AEE levels can be anticipated among participants within each site, and we anticipate finding important relationships in the individual -level analyses.  
The entire success of the project, therefore, does not rest on the group comparisons.      T he focus of this study is on the net outcome of a complex regulatory system in natural populations.  
The class of effects that include the interaction of socially -embedded behavior, food patterns, cultural  norms, 
required and voluntary PA, etc., can only be examined in observational studies.  Controlled experiments are 
therefore not useful to address this question.  Long-term prospective studies have clear advantages  over 
cross-sectional and short-term studies; however , they are also difficult to conduct and do not fit within the NIH 
funding framework.  In most instances  where epi[INVESTIGATOR_901736], cross-sectional studies have effectively  summarize d the cumulative effect of prior exposures  and 
have consistently identified true relationships among CVD risk factors (e.g. , BMI vs. BP, glucose, and 
cholesterol).  Clearly , studies of much longer duration are ultimately necessary to support causal inferences 
and will be needed in the future.   
  This project involves recruitment in [ADDRESS_1264854] international collaborative study ever conducted on hypertension and the 
only one that has yielded standardized cross -cultural prevalence estimates [81, 202].  We regard project 
described in this application as a major research opportunity which could have long-term significance.  It will be 
the sole research focus of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_901737] [ADDRESS_1264855] to maturity.  We are 
therefore committed to a maximal effort at study management and are convinced that we can obtain complete 
high quality data from all the study sites.    
 
 
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/2016  HUMAN SUBJECTS  
  
E.1  Risks to the Subjects  
  
  This study will involve the collection of medical information, activity data, plasma and urine samples from 
2,500 human participants, ages 25-45 years, from communities in 5 countries.  The participants will be recruited from residential neighborhoods in Igbo- Ora, Nigeria; Cape Town, South Africa; Seychelles; Spanish 
Town, Jamaica; and Maywood, IL, [LOCATION_003].  Participants will be recruited for this study as the primary aim is to 
determine whether or not differences in energy expenditure are responsible for the differences in relative 
weight, change in relative weight over time, and diabetes risk between these countries.  
  E.1.1  Sources of Materials  
  
  Information, activity monitoring data, and plasma samples will be collected from all participants (n = 2,500); 
urine samples will be collected on a subset participating in the DLW component of the study (n = 375).  Demographic, anthropometric, PA, environmental, and lifestyle data will be collected on all participants.  They will be assigned an identification number upon enrollment into the study.  Linkage of identification number with name, address, birth date or any other identifying information will be kept by [CONTACT_901795] a separate, password-protected data file.  Only the data managers and study investigators will have access to the linkage file.  AEE data, anthropometrics, and specimens will be collected for this  study by [CONTACT_901796].  Demographic, health history, and 
questionnaire data will be collected by a one-on -one interview.  The participants will be provided with an 
extensive explanation of the intended study  in his/her native language.  The data will be coded, cleaned and 
double entered by [CONTACT_901797].    
  E.1.[ADDRESS_1264856] Risks    
E.2.1   Recruitment and Informed Consent  
    Recruitment in all sites will be conducted through health professionals in the respective communities.  The procedure has been agreed upon by [CONTACT_901798].  The institutional review procedures at Loyola will be initiated once this application has been submitted to NIH for review.  At that time, an informed consent 
document will be created and translated/back -translated into each local language.  Our investigators and staff 
are trained to explain the study in detail to all participants, review the informed consent documents, and 
answer any questions that may arise.  There is no aspect of the study that will be withheld from any participant.            
Version Date: Version Date; 05/27/[ADDRESS_1264857] been trained 
and certified, so risk of bleeding and hematoma trauma will be minimized.    Confidentiality will be protected in several ways.  The participant will be assigned a unique identification number upon enrollment into the study.  This ID will be used on all subsequent materials, including laboratory samples, activity monitoring data and questionnaires.  The electronic file linking the name [CONTACT_901807] [CONTACT_901799] a separate passworded file at the respective study sites and 
available only to study investigators.  
   Appropriate referral will be made for any detected conditions, including elevated fasting serum glucose or 
blood pressure.  The study, however, will not assume responsibility for treatment or provision of drugs.  
  Due to the relatively high prevalence of HIV in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, we will undergo screening in Khayelitsha (South Africa).  All participants will be tested for HIV and undergo pre- and post-test 
counseling both before study enrollment at baseline and again at follow -up.  The LifeLine Khayelitsha Clinic, 
CapeTown, will counsel and test all individuals recruited for the study and treat all those found to be HIV -
positive.  This is policy in South Africa, and we have received confirmation from the officials at the LifeLine Khayelitsha Clinic that all those recruited for the study will be provided for.  All counseling, testing as well as treatment for HIV/AIDS is free of charge in South Africa as a result of both national and international efforts.  
HIV-positive individuals will be excluded from our study, as mentioned previously, because of its effects on 
metabolism and body weight.    
  
E.3  Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
    Participants will be asked to join this study for its potential scientific and public health benefits.  All individuals 
in the study may benefit directly from the screening activities, e.g., blood pressure, BMI, and fasting glucose.  
The potential benefits to others include the knowledge of AEE requirements for prevention of excess weight gain.  The research risks are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits because the possibility of a hematoma, the only real risk to a participant in this study, is no greater than that from a trip to a doctor’s appointment.  Yet, we have the chance to increase the body of knowledge which will inform national and 
international recommendations on AEE guidelines.  
   E.[ADDRESS_1264858] been made based on relatively sparse information.  The data collected from this study will greatly enhance the extant literature on this topic.  Again, the risks of this study are very minor relative to these potential gains.

Outcome measures 
• Primary:    The primary outcome measure is a binary (0,1) variable indicating improvement 
as measured by a decline of 1 or more in the total GCSI score 
 
• Secondary outcome measures will be defined to address the following areas:  
 
(1) Gastrointestinal symptoms  
- Subscores for the GCSI : nausea/vomiting, postprandial fullness, bloating 
- Total and Subscores for the GSRS  
NIH Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
gastrointestinal symptom scales.  
 
(2) Quality of Life 
- PAGI -QoL 
- SF-36 
 
(3) Inflammatory Markers  
- CRP and ESR  
 
(4) Mood and Behavior  
- Beck Depression Inventory  
- State-Trait Anxiety  
 
(5) Adverse Events  
- Biochemical tests  
- Symptoms of cardiac or pulmonary disease  
- Any other AE reported or noted throughout the study and follow -up 
 
Justification of sample size  
This will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_13491] [ADDRESS_13021] any of the decline of 
1 or more in the total GCSI score recorded during the period of treatment will be counted as not 
improved (i.e., 0) for the primary outcome. Comparisons will also be made with baseli ne total 
GCSI score and other secondary outcomes. Numerical changes will be analyzed by [CONTACT_13506]-treatment group differences in mean and median changes; P -values will 
be derived from Wilcoxon rank sum tests for comparison of the distribution of changes in each 
group The two-sided P -values so derived will be reported in the primary results paper of the trial.  
A two -sided P -value of 0.[ADDRESS_13022] treatment recommendations 
During the sc reening period, patients will receive a standardized set of recommendations to 
include dietary modification.  The patient’s medications are reviewed to eliminate drugs that might exacerbate the underlying dysmotility disorder or prevent the beneficial acti ons of a prokinetic 
agent.  Dietary modification and use of pain medications as appropriate are the primary 
management approaches.  If symptoms require further treatment during the trial, patients will be 
instructed to take rescue medications that they would usually take such as prochlorperazine for nausea and vomiting, and tramadol for abdominal pain.  These recommendations have been 
prepared by [CONTACT_13507].  This will help ensure that the patients in both treatment 
groups receive standard of care treatment. 
 
Visit schedule 
• Screening: at least [ADDRESS_13023] 1 calendar day  prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_13487]; 
screening period can last no more than 4 weeks after registration 
• Final pre-treatment interview, dispensing of study agent 
• Follow -up visits: every 4 weeks after pi[INVESTIGATOR_13492] 12 week study  
• Post-treatment: follow -up at 16 weeks 
 
(1) Screening visits and baseline data collection 
Many of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_13493]. Patients who appear to be eligible after chart review and completion of 
standard of care tests and procedures for gastroparesis will be invited to undergo 
screening for the PI[INVESTIGATOR_13494]. Patients considered by [CONTACT_13508], registered and screened at a visit that is part of the ongoing clinical care of the patient.  
 
In order to minimize the need for research-only in-person visits, telemedicine visits may 
be substituted for in person clinical trial visits or portions of clinical trial visits where 
determined to be appropriate and where determined by [CONTACT_13509]. Prior to initiating telemedicine for study visits the study team will 
explain to the participant, what a telemedicine visit entails and confirm that the study 
participant is in agreement and able to proceed with this method. Telemedicine 
acknowledgement will be obtained in accordance with the Guidance for Use of Telemedicine in Research. In the event telemedicine is not deemed feasible, the study 
visit will proceed as an in-person visit. Telemedicine visits will  be conducted using HIPAA 
compliant method approved by [CONTACT_12805].  
 As part of the screening process for the PI[INVESTIGATOR_13494], the patient must have a 
standardized 4-hour scintigraphic evaluation of gastric emptying usi ng a low fat Egg 
Beaters meal that is available for review by [CONTACT_5989]. The standard of care 
gastric emptying scintigraphy may have been obtained at any time within [ADDRESS_13024] or non-gastrointestinal causes. 
Recording of screening data on trial forms may not start until the patient has signed the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_13495]. Screening and baseline data collection procedures will 
include questionnaires, physical examination, various laboratory tests, clinical procedures 
on patients, and review of the patient’s medical chart. Data abstracted from a patient’s 
chart may include laboratory, endoscopy, scintigraphy, and radiology test results. Prior 
therapy will be reviewed and patients will be asked to stop specific treatments such as antiemetic medications. Baseline and follow up questionnaires can be answered through 
REDcap.  
 
All participants who sign the consent statement will be registered in the trial database 
(REDcap) . Each participant who starts screening will be accounted for at the end of 
screening, as either a screening success or a screening failure. A screening failure is defined and a participant who signed the consent form and was registered for the PI[INVESTIGATOR_13496], but is found to be ineligible prior to start of treatment; screening failures 
include patients who meet medical eligibility criteria but change their mind and do not 
consent to participation in the trial. The reason for screening failure will be recorded and 
keyed in the trial database.  Screening visit:  The patient should be in a fasting state (no food or drink after midnight 
the night before) for this visit. The patient will sign the consent form at or prior to the 
screening visit and will undergo a history and physical examination to identify other illness 
and contraindications for  participation such as use of antiemetic medications.  
 In addition, the patient will be provided one week supplies of the Gastroparesis Cardinal 
Symptom index -Daily Diary (GCSI -DD) for completion each night before bed. 
 
 
The patient will complete the foll owing questionnaires:  
 
- PAGI -SYM  
- Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)  
- Health-related quality of life questionnaire (SF-36v2)  
- Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)  
- State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)  
- NIH Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
gastrointestinal symptom scales.  
 
Anthropomorphic assessments (body weight, body height, body mass index [BMI], waist 
circumference, hip circumference, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body temperature); and general physical findings will be collected. 
Laboratory test results that need to be recorded from chart review or obtained as part of 
screening include: CBC (complete blood count), metabolic panel (sodium, potassium, 
chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, BUN, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), magnesium, albumin, total protein). Glucose and 
hemoglobin A1c will be measured in patients with diabetes.  
(2) Treatment Start Visit  
At this visit the patient is iss ued the study medication. Treatment can only start after 
eligibility has been fully checked and all data collected at screening visits have been keyed 
to the trial database. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy 
test. Medication can be delivered to patient home address from the Bayview  IDS 
pharmacy  
 
The GCSI-DD completed by [CONTACT_13510]. After  initial dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], the patients will be provided thee 
week s upplies of the GCSI-DD for completion each night before bed.  
 After eligibility is confirmed with the PI[INVESTIGATOR_13497]-based data management system, 
treatment can begin. The date of starting treatment is the start (zero) time for reckoning 
follow -up visits. 
 
 
(3) Follow -up visits

patient’s chart or should be collected as part of standard of care during screening. The etiologic tests required once as part of screening include: high-sensitivity C -reactive 
protein (hs -CRP); sedimentation rate (ESR); complete blood count (white blood cell count 
(WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count); comprehensive metabolic panel (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, 
BUN, creatinine, glucose, and liver panel including total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, 
aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase); and 
hemoglobin A1c.  
 
• Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders -Quality of Life (PA GI-QoL): A 
validated [ADDRESS_13026], 
or gastroparesis. Copyright© 2004 [COMPANY_012].  
 
• State Trait Anxiety Inventory : The STAI is a 40-item self -report measure designed to 
assess both si tuational and characterological anxiety. This measure provides two 
subscale scores (State and Trait) and has been shown to exhibit good reliability and 
internal consistency.  
 
• Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II) : The BDI-II is a commonly used, 
reliable 21-item self-report measure designated to assess for depression.  
 
• Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders -Symptoms (PAGI -SYM):  The 
self-reported questionnaire is composed of 20 items and 6 subscales. The severity of each 
symptom i tem over a 2- week recall period is scored from 0 (none or absent) to 5 (very 
severe). The GCSI, a 9-symptom survey relevant to gastroparesis stratified in 3 subscales 
– nausea/vomiting, fullness/early satiety, and bloating, is contained in the PAGI-SYM. The 
GCSI correlates with patient severity ratings and is responsive to changes in overall 
symptoms. Two additional items for constipation and diarrhea also will be recorded and 
scored and their main symptom will be determined. 
 
• Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS): The GSRS is a disease- specific 
instrument of 15 items combined into five symptom clusters depi[INVESTIGATOR_13500], Abdominal 
pain, Indigestion, Diarrhea, and Constipation. The GSRS has a seven-point graded Likert-
type scale where 1 represents absence of troublesome symptoms and 7 represents very 
troublesome symptoms. The reliability and validity of the GSRS are well -documented and 
norm values for a general population are available. 
 
• PROMIS NIH Scale: The Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Inform ation System 
(PROMIS®) GI Symptom item bank captures upper and lower GI symptoms (reflux, 
disrupted swallowing, nausea/vomiting, belly pain, gas /bloating /flatulence, diarrhea, 
constipation, and fecal incontinence).  
 
 
Recruitment Procedures 
 
Individuals Responsible for Approaching Participants:  
Prospective participants will be approached by [CONTACT_13514]. Referr ing physicians will obtain the patient's approval for referral prior to contact[CONTACT_13515]. Recruitment will take place while the potential participants are present for clinic 
appointments. Potential participants will be informed that participation in the GpCRC  registry is 
voluntary and that their care at Hopkins will not be affected if they decide not to join this study.  
 
How Privacy Issues will be Addressed:  
The study member will approach participants when they are alone in the exam rooms to ensure privacy so that the conversation between the participant and study member cannot be heard by 
[CONTACT_2312]. After ensuring that sufficient privacy is achieved and that the potential subjects are at ease and comfortable with their surroundings, the consent desi gnee will obtain informed consent to 
enter the study and explain the study procedures verbally and encourage the potential subjects 
to ask questions.  
 
Online Recruitment:  
Web links to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center Clinical Trials (Gastroenterology) 
webpage will be posted on professional associations' websites, including the Association for 
Gastrointestinal Motility Disorders (AGME), for potential recruitment from outside of the Hopkins 
network. These self-referred patients will, ho wever, be required to be seen by a Hopkins 
Gastroenterologist for specific research study referral and recommendation prior to being screened or contact[CONTACT_13516]. Patients recruited through online recruitment 
will need to be seen i n a regular GI clinic visit and be approached during their GI clinic visit by 
[CONTACT_13517]. 
 
Due to the length of the proposed study, participants may drop out of the study at any time due 
to relocation, disinterest, or inability/unwillingness to continue participating in study follow -up 
visits. Due to the length of the study, relocation is the only anticipated major change in the study population over the course of the study period. 
 
Risks. 
The adverse events reported in placebo-controlled clinical trials of pi[INVESTIGATOR_13501], headache, sinusitis, myalgia, tooth disorders, Diabetes Mellitus 
aggravated, pharyngitis, chest pain, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, 
irregular breathing, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, tightness 
in the chest, trouble breathing, weight gain, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated liver 
function enzymes and creatine phosphokinase (CPK).  
 
Adverse events will be evaluated in every follow up visit. A form of Adverse Event will be 
completed if the candidate complains of any symptom, sign, abnormal assessment or any combination of these. An adverse event can be an expected side effect that is of a serious nature, 
or an unexpected side effect/event regardless of severity.   
This study will monitor and report adverse events to ensure patient safety to IRB and FDA. Signs 
and symptoms associated with the adverse event will be graded as to severity by [CONTACT_13518], moderate, or severe using Version 4.03 of the National Cancer Institute’s  Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

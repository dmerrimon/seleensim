Data are presented as mean ± SD. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by [CONTACT_327574] (HOMA -IR). Area under the curve (AUC) calculations were performed using th e 
trapezoidal rule. Because of the potential cancelling effect of the early rise and late fall in plasma 
glucose and insulin when considered as AUC over 180 minutes, AUC values were partitioned into 0 to 90 
(pre-glycaemic -peak) and 90 to 180 (post -glycaemi c peak) minutes. Rate of glucose decline was 
calculated as (glucosepeak − glucosepeak + 30 min)/[ADDRESS_404102] . Plasma avexitide concentrations were collected twice daily for 3 days immediately prior to 
dosing, and over a 12 -hour period on days 1 and 3 of dosing. Pharmacokinetic variables assessed include 
C0 (pre -dose concentration), Cmax (peak post -dose concentra tion), Tmax (time of Cmax), and AUC over 
a 12 -hour period.

Study Title:Phase II trial of ixazomib and Dexamethasone versus ixazomib, dexamethasone and
lenalidomide, randomized with NFKB2 rearrangement. (Proteasome Inhibitor NFKB2
rearrangement Driven Trial, PI[INVESTIGATOR_163753])
Phase:II
Number of Patients: 90
Study Objectives
Primary
The primary objective of the study is to test whether the NFKB2 rearrangement can guide
the selection of treatment (ixazomib plus dexamethasone (Id) or ixazomib plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRd)) by [CONTACT_163801] 3 following comparison
To compare the response rate at [ADDRESS_189991] and confirm the lack of significant difference
in overall response.
To compare the response rate at 4 cycles between non-rearranged and rearranged
NFKB2 treated with Id and confirm that NFKB2 rearrangement is associated with reduce
response rate
To compare the responses rate at [ADDRESS_189992]
that that the response rate of non-rearranged patients with Id will reach 95% and has little
room to improve. Therefore, the arm non-rearranged NFKB2 gene treated with IRd has been
omitted in order to save resources. Our preliminary data has shown that adding lenalidomide
to bortezomib in rearranged NF-kB2 patients, another inhibitor of the proteasome,
resulted in response rates of 95% and published phase 1/2 data has shown that oral
ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma achieved a 92% ORR; hence, has little room for improvement either.
(Kumar SK et al Lancet Oncology 2014) .
Secondary
To compare response rates between arms at 8 cycles of treatment
To determine time to treatment failure (TTF)
To determine the frequency and severity AE in IRd treated cohort
To identify novel transcribed mutations associated with Id and IRd resistance
in patients with MM.

To determine the toxicity profile of the study drugs according to the presence
of NFKB2 rearrangement.
Delineate transcribed mutations associated with relapse or refractoriness to Id or
IRd treatment by [CONTACT_16638]-sequencing.
Overview of Study Design:
This is a multicenter open-label, 3-arm, phase II clinical trial to study the differential effect in
the treatment efficacy in term of response rate between treatment (Id vs IRd) and plasma cells
NFKB2 rearrangement status in relapsed patients with multiple myeloma.
Eligible patients with relapsed MM will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion according to their
NFKB2 rearrangement status. Patients without NFKB2 rearrangement will receive ixazomib
and dexamethasone. On the other hand, patients with NFKB2 rearrangement will be
subsequently randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_189993] arm, lenalidomide will be administered orally at a dose of 25 mg daily on
Days 1-21. (Lenalidomide starting dose to be adjusted according to baseline renal function
according to Package Insert guideline). Patient without unacceptable toxicity and with at least
minimal response should continue treatment until completion of 8 cycles.

1.1 Scientific Background
1.1.1 Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous malignancy characterized by [CONTACT_163807] B cells that result in bone marrow failure, bone destruction,
hypercalcemia, and renal failure. In the [LOCATION_002] (US), multiple myeloma represents the
second most common hematological malignancy with approximately 5 to 7 new cases diagnosed
per 100,000 people each year. Approximately 20,000 cases of multiple myeloma are diagnosed
each year and 11,000 deaths per year are due to the disease (approximately 2% of all cancer
deaths) and these rates are similar to those seen in Europe. [1]
Although multiple myeloma is uniformly fatal, treatment has dramatically improved over the last
several decades because of the use of cytotoxic drugs, the introduction of high dose therapy and
autologous transplant, and the development of novel agents. Five-year survival has improved
from 25% in 1975 to 34% in the period from 1999 to 2005 because of the development of more
effective treatment. [2,3] Most patients receive multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_78928];
however, responses are transient despi[INVESTIGATOR_78929]. Multiple
myeloma is sensitive to a number of cytotoxic drugs such as alkylating agents, anthracyclines,
and corticosteroids for initial treatment and for relapsed disease. With the introduction of several
effective agents such as proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), thalidomide, and lenalidomide, the
treatment response and the 5-year survival of multiple myeloma has improved.
1.1.2 Risk stratification in Multiple Myeloma.
The completion of the sequencing of the MM human genome and many genomic studies
confirmed multiple molecular entities that differ in clinical outcome.[4] The completion of
these studies have been accompanied with the approval of many new drugs, but in contrast to
other tumors, these technologies have been unable to identify a companion diagnostic test that
predict the subset of patients that would benefit from specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. As a result much effort
has been dedicated to define relevant MM molecular categories that will predict a successful
outcome. As such, the use of genetic approaches (like t(4-14), t(14-16) or chromosome 13 deletion
or inactivation of p53, etc), clinical risk categories (International Staging System Grade III),
biological markers (high proliferation rate), and gene expression analyses (FGFR3/MMSET,
MAF, cyclin D, hyperdiploid) have been developed to identify patients with high risk disease.
However, none of these technologies affect the selection of initial therapeutic combinations,

could determine the intensity of the therapy required to achieve an optimal response.
1.2 Clinical Experience With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Newly
Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma.
Revlimid (lenalidomide) is a thalidomide analogue that has significant clinical activity in multiple
myeloma. Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone is approved by [CONTACT_163808] (FDA) for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at
least 1 prior therapy. [5, 6] Based on the activity of this combination in the relapse/refractory
setting, clinical trials are ongoing or have been completed in patients with NDMM. [7]
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a randomized phase 3, multicenter,
open-label study (E4A03) in patients with NDMM. The primary outcome of the trial was to
determine whether low-dose dexamethasone plus lenalidomide was noninferior to high-dose
dexamethasone plus lenalidomide. After 4 cycles of therapy, patients could either discontinue the
planned protocol therapy to undergo a stem-cell transplant or continue on protocol therapy until
disease progression. [7] Results suggest that that lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone is
associated with better OS and a lower toxicity profile compared to lenalidomide plus high-dose
dexamethasone. [7] In this study, 445 patients were randomly assigned to a high-dose (n = 223)
or low-dose (n = 222) dexamethasone/lenalidomide regimen. Patients randomized to the high-
dose regimen were administered lenalidomide 25 mg on Days 1 through 21, plus dexamethasone
40 mg on Days 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 of a 28-day cycle. Patients assigned
to the low-dose regimen received the same schedule of lenalidomide with dexamethasone 40 mg
on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle.
One hundred and sixty-nine (79%) of 214 patients receiving high-dose treatment and 142 (68%)
of 205 patients on low-dose treatment had complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) within
4 cycles. At the 1-year, second interim analysis, however, OS was 96% (95% confidence interval
94–99) in the low-dose dexamethasone group compared with 87% (82–92) in the high-dose group
(p = 0.0002). The most common Grade 3 toxicities were deep vein thrombosis (26% vs 12%; p =
0.0003), infections including pneumonia (16% vs 9%; p = 0.04), and fatigue (15% vs 9%, p =
0.08) for the high-dose vs low-dose dexamethasone containing groups respectively.
Consequently, the trial was stopped and patients on high-dose therapy were crossed over to low-
dose therapy. [7]
Emory University
Clinical Study ProtocolIXAZOMIB
Confidential [ADDRESS_190017] Oncology Group (SWOG) conducted a randomized, phase 3, double-blind,
crossover, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in patients with NDMM. [8] The primary
endpoint was to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with
dexamethasone plus lenalidomide or placebo. The target accrual was 500 patients; however the
study closed early with an accrual of 198 after results of the ECOG trial E4A03 reported improved
survival using low-dose dexamethasone versus high-dose dexamethasone plus lenalidomide. [8]
These results affected the acceptability of the high-dose dexamethasone control group.
In a blinded manner, patients participating in the SWOG trial were randomized to lenalidomide
25 mg on Days 1 through 28 of a 35-day cycle for 3 induction cycles, then 21 of 28 days as
maintenance, plus dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20
in induction, and then on Days 1 through 4, and Days 15 through 18 during maintenance; the
comparator arm included dexamethasone plus placebo administered according to the same
induction and maintenance schedules. Therapy was unblinded at disease progression and patients
in the control arm could cross over to the lenalidomide-dexamethasone regimen. The estimated
1-year PFS was 77% in the 100 patients treated with lenalidomide-dexamethasone and 55% in the
98 with dexamethasone plus placebo; however, 1-year OS was similar in both groups (93% vs
91%).[8] The response rate was 85.3% (22.1% CR) versus 51.3% (3.8% CR) in the groups
respectively. Grade ¾ neutropenia, infections, and thrombosis were more common in patients
treated with lenalidomide-dexamethasone.
1.3 Multiple Myeloma and Response to Proteasome Inhibitor.
Protein homeostasis that occurs through regulation of protein production and destruction is one
of the critical biological processes that play a role in cell survival. The ubiquitin-proteasome
system is the major regulatory system through which this occurs and represents the primary
mechanism by [CONTACT_163809], including those involved in growth control, cell cycle
regulation, and apoptosis.
The completion of these biological studies has allowed the development of several new potent
drugs in MM1. One such medication, the proteasome inhibitor, has become the backbone of
current therapeutic approaches for MM. These drugs inhibit the catalytic proteolytic core (20S)
subunit of the 26S proteasome. As a consequence proteasome inhibitors reduced protein
degradation and disrupt several distinct cell regulatory mechanisms leading to inhibition of cell
growth and survival pathways, dysregulation of the cell cycle, and induction of apoptosis. Clinical
studies with the only FDA approved proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, have validated the
proteasome as a therapeutic target for the treatment of malignancies. Bortezomib is approved for

(Bortezomib product label)
Bortezomib has proven effective in the frontline setting, has shown marked response in the
relapsed setting, and is an effective agent in the pretransplant setting. However, 38% of the
patients treated with the first generations of bortezomib combination (dexamethasone) achieved
optimal response (defined as complete or very good response), 60%-87% of patients fail toreach
this goal 2. Hence, second generation of bortezomib combinations including other novel agents
have been develop and are achieving significant improvements in its therapeutic response (OR:70-
90% with complete responses in 40-50% of the cases) and overall survival (of 29-35% at 5 years)
3. But, despi[INVESTIGATOR_163758], the disease remains
incurable and there remains a need for new and better agents. Hence new efforts to target the 20S
proteasome has allowed the dosing of second-generation proteasome inhibitor (Ixazomib) forthe
treatment of both hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies.
1.4 Clinical Experience of BORTEZOMIB [Bortezomib] Plus Lenalidomide and
Dexamethasone.
Evidence to support combining bortezomib with immunomodulatory analogues, includes
preclinical data demonstrating synergistic effects on apoptosis, clinical efficacy seen with the
combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in relapsed/ refractory disease, and
the clinical activity of these agents in NDMM patients. [11-16].
Richardson and colleagues conducted a phase 1/2 study combining lenalidomide, bortezomib, and
dexamethasone in NDMM patients. [11] The primary endpoints were to determine themaximum
tolerated dose (MTD) of this combination (phase 1) and to evaluate response rate ( PR) to the
combination (phase 2). Response assessments were done after 4 and 8 cycles of therapy.
Responses were assessed by [CONTACT_163810]
(EBMT) and Uniform criteria [17] to include near complete response (nCR) and very good partial
response (VGPR). Patients received lenalidomide on Days 1 through 14, bortezomib on Days 1,
4, 8, and 11, and dexamethasone on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12, for eight 21-day cycles.
Patients with a CR or nCR/PR after Cycle 4 could proceed at any point to stem cell mobilization
and transplantation. Patients with stable or responding disease without unacceptable toxicity at
the completion of Cycle 8, were allowed to continue onto the maintenance phase of the study
which comprised 3-week cycles of bortezomib on Days 1 and 8, lenalidomide on Days 1 through
14 at the doses tolerated at the completion of Cycle 8, and dexamethasone 10 mg the day before
and after bortezomib (Days 1, 2, 8, and 9). [11]
Emory University
Clinical Study ProtocolIXAZOMIB
Confidential 25 09 December 2022In the phase 1 portion of the study, dose-escalation proceeded (3 patient cohorts) depending on
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) initially with 4 planned dose levels (lenalidomide/bortezomib:
15/1.0, 15/1.3, 20/1.3, 25/1.3 plus dexamethasone at fixed doses of 40 mg cycles 1-4 /20mg cycles
5-8). Based on safety data, an additional dose level (ie, 4M [lenalidomide 25mg/bortezomib1.3
mg/m 2]) with reduced dexamethasone (20/10 mg), was added; this was determined to be the MTD
of the combination and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Overall 66 patients were enrolled
to this study (phase 1 n = 31; phase 2 n = 35). [11]
Results indicated that the combination of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone was
highly active in patients with NDMM, with all patients (100%) achieving at least a pre-ASCT
response of PR and high rates of VGPR or better (CR+ nCR+VGPR). Consistent with reports
from other studies, response rates were unaffected by [CONTACT_163811]. In both
the phase 2 population and overall, 74% and 67% respectively achieved a VGPR or better.
Overall, [ADDRESS_190018] a PR after 4 cycles of treatment (6% CR/nCR; 5% VGPR,
and 64% PR). Improvement in response by [CONTACT_163812] 75% of
the 56 patients that continued on therapy from Cycle 4 through Cycle 8, with further improvement
in response noted in 20 of 37 patients who continued beyond cycle 8 with maintenance therapy.
With a median follow-up of 21 months, neither the median duration of response (DOR) nor
median OS has been reached. With 68% of patients still responding after more than 18 months,
the estimated 18-month PFS and survival with/without ASCT is 75% and 97% respectively. The
3-drug combination was well tolerated with generally manageable toxicities. Neuropathy was
noted but often low grade and reversible with dose modification. There was no Grade 4
neuropathy and limited rates of Grade 3 neuropathy (2% peripheral sensory neuropathy [any grade
80%], 2% peripheral motor neuropathy [any grade 18%], and 3% neuropathic pain [any grade
32%]). Other Grade [ADDRESS_190019] 5% of patients included lymphopenia
(14%), neutropenia (9%), thrombocytopenia (6%), thrombosis (6%), hypokalemia (5%), and
hypophosphatemia (5%). [11] The authors concluded the bortezomib, lenalidomide,
dexamethasone (VRD) combination was a highly effective regimen for patients with NDMM
supporting the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials designed to assess the benefit of this 3-drug approach
compared with a 2-drug approach (dexamethasone plus either bortezomib or lenalidomide,
depending on the specific trial). [11]
Kumar and colleagues reported results of a randomized, phase 1/2 study of 3- and 4-drug
combination regimens containing bortezomib (BORTEZOMIB; V), dexamethasone (D),

Confidential 26 09 December 2022(EVOLUTION Study). [12] Previously untreated patients with measurable disease were
randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups receiving up to eight 21-day cycles of induction therapy
followed by [CONTACT_66997] 42-day maintenance cycles of V 1.3 mg/m 2(Days 1, 8, 15, 22) (all treatment
arms). Patients eligible for autologous stem cell transplant could undergo stem cell mobilization
any time after cycle 2 and stem cell transplant (SCT) any time after Cycle 4. Response categories
were based on the IMWG Criteria (See section 15.3) with the addition of nCR, and adverse events
(AEs) were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0. The phase 1 part of the study evaluated increasing
doses of cyclophosphamide with fixed doses of bortezomib, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide in
order to determine the MTD of the combination. [12] The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 portion
of the study was the combined CR + VGPR rate. All combinations administered bortezomib 1.3
mg/m 2IV (Days 1, 4, 8, 11) and dexamethasone 40 mg orally (Day 1, 8, 15) every 21 days repeated
for 8 cycles followed by [CONTACT_151213] 1.3 mg/m 2alone (Days 1, 8, 15, 22) in a 6-week cycle for 4
cycles. Revlimid was given at 25 mg orally (Days 1-14) in the VDR arm and at 15 mg in the VDCR
arm. In the VDCR arm, patients were treated with escalating doses of cyclophosphamide (100,
200, 300, 400, or 500 mg/m 2) orally Days 1, 8, and every [ADDRESS_190020]
planned dose of 500 mg/m 2. [13] In the phase 2 part of the study, the VDC arm was modified to
add a Day 15 dose of cyclophosphamide given the lower than previously reported efficacy rate of
the VDC combination.
One-hundred forty patients were enrolled with 132 patients being response evaluable ([ADDRESS_190021], 32 VDC, and 17 VDC-modified) at the data cut-off. Responses and estimated long-term
outcomes are noted below in Table 1-1. The median number of VDR, VDCR, VDC, and VDC-
modified cycles received is 5 (range 1-12), 6 (range 1-12), 6 (range 3-12), and 6 (range 3-12),
respectively. The median DOR had not been reached in any arm as of the data cut-off. Forty-six
patients had samples assessed for minimal residual disease with 46% of those who achieved CR
(including stringent CR [sCR]) or nCR being minimal residual disease-negative. [13]

Long-term follow-up continues to assess the durability of response as well as the depth of the

SWOG is currently conducting a randomized, phase 3 trial of lenalidomide with low-dose
dexamethasone (LLD) versus bortezomib plus LLD for induction in patients with NDMM without
intent for immediate autologous stem cell transplant (S0777). The primary outcome of the trialis
to compare PFS with LLD with or without bortezomib. A secondary objective is to assess OS and
long-term outcomes stratified by [CONTACT_163813]. Patients are
randomized to lenalidomide 25 mg on Days 1 through 21 plus dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1,
8, 15, 22, and every 28 days for 6 cycles or to bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 plus

unacceptable toxicity are removed from the study at that time. After 6 months of therapy, patients
without progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity receive maintenance therapy consisting

(C16010) patient populations are currently evaluating ixazomib in combination with Revlimid
and Dexamethasone (RevDex) versus placebo/RevDex. Both trials are combining ixazomib at a
weekly dose of 4.[ADDRESS_190025] dose of lenalidomide
with a weekly dexamethasone dose of 40 mg. In addition, ongoing clinical pharmacology studies
include evaluation of drug-drug interactions (DDI) with ketoconazole and rifampin, effect of food,
and oral bioavailability. Studies evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) of ixazomib
alone (in Japanese patients) and in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in Asian
adult patients (including Japanese patients) with a diagnosis of NDMM are ongoing.
As of 27 March 2013, preliminary clinical data is available for a total of 653 patients across 13
studies. The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well tolerated. The
adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the class-based effects of proteasome inhibition and are
similar to what has been previously reported with VELCADE though the severity of some, for
example peripheral neuropathy, is less. While some of these potential toxicities may be severe,
they can be managed by [CONTACT_20548], or, as needed,
dose modification or discontinuation.
Fatigue was the most common AE reported among 384 patients treated in the oral (PO) studies
(47%). Other common AEs reported in the pooled intravenous (IV) and PO safety populations
include nausea, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and vomiting. Rash is also a commonly reported
treatment-emergent event; however, there is some variety in its characterization and causality
resulting in different preferred terms to describe it. A high-level term outline of rash events
includes rashes, eruptions and exanthemas NEC; pruritus NEC; erythemas; papulosquamous
conditions; and exfoliative conditions. The dose escalation phases of most trials reported in the
IB have now completed enrollment, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were the common dose-
limiting toxicities (DLTs) when the use of prophylactic anti-emetics was not permitted per
protocol. In the expansion cohorts or phase 2 cohorts (as per each study), the incidence and
severity of GI symptoms was mitigated by [CONTACT_20549]
(MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) (as per each study) and standard clinical usage of
anti-emetics and/or antidiarrheal medications as deemed appropriate. Prophylactic use of anti-
emetics has not been required as with other agents but (as outlined in Section 6.7) has been used
according to standard practice and are effective.

1.5.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism
Clinical IV and PO PK data show that ixazomib citrate (measured as the biologically active
boronic acid form of ixazomib [MLN2238]) has multi-exponential disposition with a rapid initial
phase that is largely over by [ADDRESS_190026] time of occurrence of maximum (peak) concentration (T max) of approximately
0.5 to 2.0 hours and a terminal disposition half-life (t 1/2) after multiple dosing of approximately 5
to 7 days [6]. Results of a population PK analysis (n = 137) show that there is no relationship
between body surface area (BSA) or body weight and clearance (CL). Also, based on stochastic
simulations for fixed dose, exposures are independent of the individual patient’s BSA [7]. Based
on these data, a recommendation was made for fixed dosing in clinical trials. An absolute
bioavailability of 67% was determined for ixazomib using the population PK analysis. Please
refer to the current ixazomib IB and Safety Management Attachment (SMA) for information on
the PK for IV doses of ixazomib.
Metabolism appears to be the major route of elimination for ixazomib, and urinary excretion of
the parent drug is negligible (< 5% of dose). In vitro studies indicate that ixazomib is metabolized
by [CONTACT_20550] P450s (CYPs) and non-CYP enzymes/proteins. The rank order of relative
biotransformation activity of the 5 major human CYP isozymes was 3A4 (34.2%) > 1A2 (30.7%)
> 2D6 (14.7%) > 2C9 (12.1%) > 2C19 (< 1%). ixazomib is not an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9,
2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 nor a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. The potential for ixazomib
treatment to produce drug-drug interactions (DDIs) via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low.
However, there may be a potential for DDIs with a concomitant strong CYP3A4 or CYP1A2
inhibitor or inducer because of the potential for first-pass metabolism when ixazomib is

Confidential 31 09 December 2022administered via the PO route and because of the moderate contribution of CYP3A4-and CYP1A2-
mediated metabolism of ixazomib in human liver microsomes. ixazomib may be a weak substrate
of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance
associated protein (MRP2) efflux pump transporters. ixazomib is not an inhibitor of Pgp, BCRP,
and MRP2. The potential for DDIs with substrates or inhibitors of Pgp, BCRP, and MRP2 is,

1.5.4 Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral Formulation of ixazomib
As of 27 March 2013, a total of 507 patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL
amyloidosis, nonhematologic cancers, and lymphoma) have been treated in studies evaluating the
oral ixazomib formulation. These patients have been treated with different doses of ixazomib
either as a single-agent treatment (in 201 patients) or in combination with currently clinically
available treatments (in 306 patients). Information regarding the ongoing studies, patient
populations, and doses investigated is included in Table 1-1.

1.5.5 Overview of the Oral Formulation of ixazomib
The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well tolerated. The adverse
events (AEs) are consistent with the class-based effects of proteasome inhibition and are similar
to what has been previously reported with VELCADE though the severity of some, for example
peripheral neuropathy, is less. While some of these potential toxicities may be severe, they can be
managed by [CONTACT_20548], or, as needed, dose
modification or discontinuation.
In the 4 ongoing studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) investigating single-agent oral
ixazomib in patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis,
nonhematologic cancers, and lymphoma), a total of [ADDRESS_190028] frequent (at least 10%) AEs occurring in the pooled safety
population from single-agent oral ixazomib Studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) is
shown in Table 1-2.

Study C16003 is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1 study of ixazomib dosing on a twice-
weekly schedule on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle in adult patients with RRMM.(15, 16)
Study C16004 is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1 study of ixazomib dosing on a weekly
schedule on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle in adults patients with RRMM.(17, 18, 19) Both
studies have now completed enrollment. The DLTs in Study C16003 were rash macular and
thrombocytopenia and the DLTs in C16004 were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and erythema
multiforme.
In the dose escalation component of both studies, patients had multiple myeloma that had relapsed
following at least [ADDRESS_190035] included bortezomib, thalidomide (or
lenalidomide), and corticosteroids. In both studies, when the MTD was established, cohorts of
patients representing the heterogeneous patient population currently seen in clinical practice were
to be enrolled into 1 of 4 expansion cohorts, including a relapsed and refractory cohort, a
carfilzomib cohort, a proteasome inhibitor-naïve cohort, and a VELCADE-relapsed cohort.
Ixazomib trial C16003 a Phase 1 study of twice-weekly dosing of investigational oral proteasome
inhibitor ixazomib in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma(21). Among 55
response-evaluable patients, 15% achieved partial response or better (with 76% stable disease or
better). These findings have informed the subsequent clinical development of ixazomib in multiple
myeloma.
In trial C16004, weekly dosing of ixazomib in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (22), the
MTD was determined to be 2.97 mg/m . Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhea in 2 patients, and grade 3 skin rash in 1 patient. Common drug-related adverse events
were thrombocytopenia (43%), diarrhea (38%), nausea (38%), fatigue (37%), and vomiting
(35%). The observed rate of peripheral neuropathy was 20%, with only one grade 3 event reported.
Nine (18%) patients achieved a partial response or better, including 8 of 30 (27%) evaluable
patients treated at the MTD. Pharmacokinetic studies suggested a long terminal half- life of 3.6-
11.3 days, supporting once-weekly dosing.
1.5.7 Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM)
Multiple research paths are being explored in patients with NDMM with a focus on evaluating
ixazomib in combination with agents commonly used across treatment settings. The development
of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide with dexamethasone (LenDex) in patients with
NDMM who are transplant eligible or ineligible involves 2 studies (C16005 and C16008) with

dexamethasone. Ixazomib is also being evaluated in combination with melphalan and prednisone
(MP) for patients who are not transplant eligible due to age or coexisting morbidity (in Study
C16006).
The C16005 trial evaluated the combination of weekly MNL9708 and lenalidomide in a phase
1/2 trial. Of 19 response-evaluable pts (Ph 1 + Ph 2), all achieved≥PR,including 5 CR (1 sCR),
4 VGPR, and 10 PR; all remain in response with duration of confirmed response of up to 9.5
months. Of 4 response-evaluable Ph 2 pts, 1 has achieved VGPR and 3 PR to date. Oral ixazomib
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone appears well tolerated with manageable toxicity. These
data show antitumor activity at the RP2D in pts with previously untreated MM, with≥PRin all
patients at the time of reporting (ref).
Twice-weekly oral ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide (len) and dexamethasone (dex) in
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma was also reported.(23) In 58 response-evaluable
pts,≥PRrate to date was 93%, including 67%≥VGPR(24% CR, including 14% sCR). 54% of
pts had 100% decreases in M-protein or serum free light chain from baseline. Analysis of minimal
residual disease is ongoing; data will be presented. Depth of response increased over the course
of treatment; median time to first response(≥PR)was 0.[ADDRESS_190036] response to date was
2.07 mos. Median DOR to date was 5.9+ mos, ranging up to 18+ mos. Most common AEs were
rash (61%; pooled high-level terms), fatigue, peripheral edema (each 50%), diarrhea (41%), and
neuropathy peripheral (36%). Drug-related (to any drug in the regimen) grade 3 AEs were seen in
56% of pts, including rash (16%), hyperglycemia (8%), pneumonia (6%), and PN (5%; high- level
term). No drug-related grade 4 AEs were seen; 58% of pts required dose reductions of at least
one drug due to AEs including rash (16%), anxiety (11%), and PN (8%). AEs resulting in
discontinuation were seen in 11%, with the majority reported as not related to therapy. There was

newly diagnosed MM. However, rates of rash, PN, and dose reductions appear higher than in the

supporting use of weekly dosing in ongoing phase 3 trials and future combination trials such as

1.6 NFKB2 Biomarker
A prospective study between May 2007 to June 2012 was performed to analyze the loss of NFKB2
3’end in patients treated with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (VD). The outcome of the study
was to determine if the loss of NFKB2 was associated with suboptimal (defined as stable or
progressive disease) response at 4 cycles. In this study 83 patients were recruited. Twenty seven
ineligible patients were excluded from the study because they had a treatment variation (n=15),
misdiagnosis (n=2), poor quality of bone marrow sample (n=3), low quality sorting (n=5) or extra
medullary disease only (n=2). Thus, clinical information, plasma cells and match germ line DNA
derived from blood granulocytes was obtained from 56 patients. Patient characteristics at
inclusion are shown in Table 1 (appendix 1). Twelve patients (21%) with impaired renal function
(serum creatinine more than 1.5 mg/dL) were included.
In this population, 40 patients (70%) had available results from FISH or G banding karyotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 15 patients (37%) of which 8 patients (20%) had
deletion chromosome 13, 3 patients (7.5%) had complex cytogenetics, 2 patients (5%) had cyclin
D1 amplification, 2 patients (5%) with t(11-14) and 2 patients (5%) with t(4-14).

We measured the 3’ end of NFKB2 of CD38(+) plasma cells and match germ line DNA derived
from blood granulocytes of 56 patients included in the study. Our preliminary data showed that
that 25 out of 56 had lower NFKB2 3’ end mRNA expression levels. To identify whether the loss
of NFKB2 3’end resulted from a rearrangement, we performed a NFKB2 break a part FISH in 31
patient of this cohort. Our results demonstrated that 9 (29%) patients with a positive structural
defect in this region. In addition, when we expanded the screening with the NFKB2 break a part
FISH in [ADDRESS_190039]
in 7/20 patients (35%).
1.6.2 Origin of NFKB2 break point.
To identify potential sites of break and partners rearranged with NFKB2, we performed analysis
of the WGS data obtained from Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP) database. We first selected
paired end reads in which one read was mapped to NFKB2 and the mate outside of NFKB2. This
analysis delineated three potential sites of break clustered in the promoter region, intron 1, and
the exon-intron junction of exon 12 (Figure 1A). These results were expanded by [CONTACT_163815] 3 samples from our clinical database (2 non responder and 1 responder patient
as control) and found in addition to the break point between exon 12 and 13 another potential site
of break near exon 20, both of which had the presence of a repetitive element. To further validate
the site of NFKB2 break in our population, we performed long range PCR in 3 cases treated with
VD (2 non responders and 1 responder). As shown in figure 2B-C, a break point was located
between exons 12 and 14. In addition, these results were confirmed by [CONTACT_163816] a part fluorescent
in situ hybridization methods (Figure 2D). Our findings demonstrated that 9 patients out of 31
patients studied had NFKB2 break (29%) and 4 out of 8 patients with low NFKB2 3’end also had
NFKB2 breaks.
1.6.3 Somatic NFKB2 rearrangement and response to Bortezomib and
dexamethasone treatment
We assessed the influence of the loss of NF-kB 3’end and the presence of NFKB2 rearrangement
on the clinical response of patients with multiple myeloma after 4 cycles of treatment with
bortezomib and dexamethasone. Figure 2A-B, illustrate the response status and the depth of
response with the level of NFKB2 3’ end, as displayed by a ratio generated from comparing
NFKB2 3’ end from CD138 (+) cells and peripheral blood leukocytes. Our univariate analysis
demonstrated that patients with low NFKB2 3’end ratio and abnormal FISH experience a lower
response rate than those with >1 ratio and a normal break a part FISH (odds ratio [OR] of 10.8;

significance also predicted for a better response to treatment with proteasome inhibitors (OR: 7.6;
95% CI of 1.2 to 47.6, p<0.05). However, after adjusting for potential predictors of patient
outcome in our multivariate Cox model analysis we found that only loss of NFKB2 3’end was
associated with a significant decrease in bortezomib and dexamethasone response ( HR:21.47,
95% CI: 2.99 to 154.399, p <0.01).
We further examined the sensitivity and specificity of the NFKB2 3’ end ratio after performing
an ROC curve. Using a cut off of 0.[ADDRESS_190040]

NFKB2 break-apart FISH signal as a predictor of response, we performed FISH on whole bone
marrow of 31 patients in which QPCR data was available. Using a cut off detected by [CONTACT_163817],
we identified NFKB2 structural rearrangement in 9 patients (30%) patients of which 6/10 were
present in VD-non responders and 3/21 of VD-responders. To validate these findings we
performed FISH on CD38+ sorted cell from 23 new patients treated with bortezomib and
dexamethasone or carfilzomib, an irreversible inhibitor of the proteasome, and found consistency
with our previous results, in which 7 patients demonstrated a NFKB2 positive break signal. Five
out of 7 samples of non-responders patients demonstrated a positive break signal while 1/16 were
positive in the responders, indicating a chromosome translocation or inversion had disrupted the
NFKB2 locus and that this disruption predispose tumors to respond poorly to proteasome
inhibitors.
Subsequently, we tested multiple cell lines for NFKB2 rearrangement and identified by [CONTACT_163818]88 presents a balance translocation between chromosomes 10 and 3. Taking
advantage of this finding we compared the sensitivity of detection between 3’end NFKB2 qPCR
3’ end NFKB2 ratio and the break-apart FISH. To this end, we mixed cell line with normal
NFKB2, as it is in MM1S, with titrating doses of HUT88. Quantitative PCR was able to detect a
minimum of 3% HUT88 cells in the mix, while NFKB2 break-apart FISH was able to detect when
the percent of HUT88 reach 10%. The correlation between both tests was r2:0.98, P<0.02.

doses of bortezomib. Cells with low levels of NFKB2 show more resistance to bortezomib
treatment than cells with high NFKB2 levels, suggesting that NFKB2 might be important for
bortezomib mediated apoptosis (Figure 3B).
[IP_ADDRESS] NFKB2 is important in bortezomib mediated apoptosis.
To determine whether the NFKB2 is involved in bortezomib sensitivity, we silenced NFKB2 in
2 bortezomib sensitive cell lines (OPM1 and OPM2) and tested for their response to bortezomib.
Our results demonstrated that silencing of NFKB2 in OPM1 and OPM2 cell lines decrease
bortezomib apoptotic effect significantly (Figure 3E-F, P<0.01). However, when we restore the
expression of the domains contained in the 3’ end of NFKB2 (ankyrin domain) in NFKB2 silenced
cells, we observed an improvement in bortezomib sensitivity. Furthermore, overexpression of
NFKB2 or any of the 3’end domains (Ankyrin or death domain) increased bortezomib apoptotic
effect independent of their original sensitivity to bortezomib (Figure 3F-G).
[IP_ADDRESS].1 NFKB2 promotes the complex formation of p62/FADD and
caspase-8 to facilitate caspase 8 processing.
Since previous work has established that autophagy and caspase 8 are api[INVESTIGATOR_163759], we performed a time course
in 2 bortezomib-sensitive cells (MM1S and OPM1) to measure the sequence of events that leads
to caspase 3 activation. Caspase 8 was processed to their 43/41 subunits at 2 hours, and to p20 at
times correlating with caspase 9 cleavage (6 hours, Figure 4A-B). Supported by [CONTACT_63015], we
investigated the consequence that silencing NFKB2 has on caspase 8 activation. NFKB2 reduced
caspase 8 activation early on followed by 9 and 3 activation (Figure 4B.1 and B.2).
The domains contained in the NFKB2 3’end participate in the formation of a death-inducing
signaling complex that links death receptor signals with caspase 8 activation upon irradiation or
TNFtreatment. Furthermore, in T cells FADD dependent binding to Atg5-Atg12 in
autophagosomes is essential for caspase 8 processing. We therefore investigated whether NFKB2
is linked with several of the autophagy members required for caspase 8 processing during
proteasome inhibition. NFKB2-v5 tagged protein was immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_163760], TNF or control OPM1 cells expressing a 3’ end V5 tagged NFKB2 protein.

results were observed in cells expressing endogenous FADD and NFKB2 protein levels (Figure
4E). To determine, which of these potential NFKB2 binding partners were directly bound to
NFKB2, we immunoprecipated FADD in NFKB2 silenced OPM1 cells. Silencing NFKB2 led to
a reduction in FADD, P62, caspase 8 binding and increase Atg5/Atg12-FADD binding,
suggesting that NFKB2 plays a major role in FADD-P62-Caspase 8 complex formation (Figure
4E). Finally, p62 and caspase 8 colocalization was evaluated in a time course of OPM1 cells
treated with bortezomib (10 nM) and demonstrated that p62-caspase 8 complex formation lasted
for 6 hours before returning to baseline. Together, these results link NFKB2 with the initiating
signaling required for caspase 8 activation during bortezomib treatment (Figure 4F).

a prospective; biomarker driven randomized controlled trial to compare the clinical response of
relapsed MM patients treated with ixazomib plus dexamethasone versus ixazomib, lenalidomide
and dexamethasone based on their diagnostic NFKB2 break apart FISH results. The objectives of
the trial are to address whether patients without NFKB2 rearrangements treated with Id can have
a similar outcome to those with NFKB2 rearrangements treated with IRd regimen as assessed by
[CONTACT_163822], monoclonal protein, serum kappa lambda light chains, and bone disease.
Correlative studies in this proposal will characterize the gain of new genetic abnormalities in
plasma cells of patients that are refractory or relapsed after Id or IRd treatment. To this end, we
will assess for transcribed mutations by [CONTACT_163823] (RNA-seq) of plasma cells
acquired from bone marrow biopsies obtained pre-randomization and at relapse or in patients with
evidence of progression.

selection of treatment (Ixazomib plus dexamethasone (Id) or ixazomib plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone (IRd)) by [CONTACT_163801] 3 following comparisons:
oTo compare the response rate at [ADDRESS_190046] that the response rate of
non-rearranged patients with Id is expected toreach 95% and has little room to improve.
Therefore, the arm non-rearranged NFKB2 gene treated with IRd has been omitted in order to
save resources. Our preliminary data has shown that adding lenalidomide to bortezomib, another
inhibitor of the proteasome, resulted in response rates of 95% and published data has shown that
ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide (len) and dexamethasone (dex) in newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma achieved a 92%; hence, has little room for improvement.
2.2 Secondary Objectives
To determine time to treatment failure (TTF)
To determine the frequency and severity AE in IRd treated cohort
To identify novel transcribed mutations associated with Id and IRd resistance in patients with

7.5.1 Excluded Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inducers should be avoided,
unless there is no appropriate alternative medication for the patient’s use (Rationale: If there were
to be a DDI with an inducer, ixazomib exposure would be less; therefore, there would be a reduced
chance of an AE. However, there may be less chance for an antitumor effect, but that is not an
absolute reason to be taken off ixazomib):
Strong CYP3A inducers: rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, and

When digoxin was co-administered with lenalidomide, the digoxin AUC was not
significantly different; however, the digoxin Cmax was increased by 14%. Periodic
monitoring of digoxin plasma levels in accordance with clinical judgment and based on
standard clinical practice in patients receiving this medication is recommended during
administration of lenalidomide.
7.9 Pregnancy
It is not known what effects ixazomib has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or
fetus. Lenalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Therefore,
female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male patients
should avoid impregnating a female partner. Females of child bearing potential* and male
patients should use effective methods of contraception through defined periods during and after
study treatment as specified below.
*A female of child bearing potential is any sexually mature female who:
1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or
2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses
at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

Confidential [ADDRESS_190079] Risk of Reactivation of Herpes Infection
Patients may be at an increased risk of infection including reactivation of herpes zoster and herpes
simplex viruses. Antiviral therapy such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or other antivirals may be
initiated as clinically indicated. Other antivirals are also acceptable.
7.10.3 Nausea and/or Vomiting
Standard anti-emetics including 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 serotonin receptor antagonists are
recommended for emesis if it occurs once treatment is initiated; prophylactic anti-emetics may
also be considered at the physician’s discretion. Dexamethasone should not be administered as an
anti-emetic. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study drug and during treatment.
7.10.4 Diarrhea
Prophylactic antidiarrheals will not be used in this protocol. However, diarrhea should be
managed according to clinical practice, including the administration of antidiarrheals once
infectious causes are excluded. Fluid intake should be maintained to avoid dehydration. Fluid
deficit should be corrected before initiation of treatment and during treatment.
7.10.5 Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus
As with bortezomib, rash with or without pruritus has been reported with ixazomib, primarily at
the higher doses tested and when given with agents where rash is an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_163774]. The rash may range from limited erythematous areas, macular and/or small papular
bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body, to a more generalized eruption
that is predominately on the trunk or extremities. Rash has been most commonly characterized
as maculopapular or macular. To date, when it does occur, rash is most commonly reported within
the first 3 cycles of therapy. The rash is often transient, self-limiting, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_20539] 1 to
2 in severity.
Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or corticosteroids (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) have been
successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylactically in subsequent cycles. The
use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], IV, or oral steroid (eg, prednisone≤10 mg per day or equivalent) is permitted.
Management of a Grade 3 rash may require intravenous antihistamines or corticosteroids.
Administration of ixazomib (and/or other causative agent if given in combination) should be
modified per protocol and re-initiated at a reduced level from where rash was noted (also, per
protocol).
The lenalidomide induced rash is characterized as generalized, maculopapular, morbilliform,
urticarial, papular, often with pruritus. Per the package insert, discontinuation should be
considered for Grade 2-[ADDRESS_190080] been reported. Lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should
be considered as described in the Package Insert/Summary of Product Characteristics.
(lenalidomide product label)
In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or any
SAE involving rash is recommended. Prophylactic measures should also be considered if a patient
has previously developed a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol-free emollient cream on dry areas of
the body or oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_12669]). Punch biopsies for histopathological analysis are
encouraged at the discretion of the investigator.
7.10.[ADDRESS_190081] clinical practice. Ixazomib and/or
lenalidomide (IRd treatment group) administration should be modified as noted as per dose
modification recommendations in the protocol when thrombocytopenia occurs (see Table 6-2).
Therapy can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon recovery of platelet counts. A rare risk is
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare blood disorder where blood clots form in
small blood vessels throughout the body characterized by [CONTACT_12703], petechiae, fever, or
possibly more serious signs and symptoms. TTP should be managed symptomatically according
to standard medical practice.
7.10.[ADDRESS_190082]
clinical practice. Ixazomib and/or lenalidomide (IRd treatment group) administration should be
modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in the protocol when neutropenia
occurs (see Section 7.2.1).
7.10.[ADDRESS_190083] been
reported with ixazomib. Blood pressure should be closely monitored while the patient is on study
treatment and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the setting of concomitant
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or
diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either hypo- or hypertension) should be managed
according to standard clinical practice, including considerations for dose adjustments of their
concomitant medications during the course of the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before
initiation of study drug and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydration.
7.10.10 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
One case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, which ultimately resolved, has been
reported with ixazomib. This condition is characterized by [CONTACT_12704], seizures and visual loss, as
well as abrupt increase in blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed by [CONTACT_163831] (MRI). If the syndrome is diagnosed or suspected, symptom-directed treatment should
be maintained until the condition is reversed by [CONTACT_163832].
7.10.11 Transverse Myelitis
Transverse myelitis has also been reported with ixazomib. It is not known if ixazomib causes
transverse myelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving ixazomib, thepossibility
that ixazomib may have contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be excluded.
7.11 Preparation, Reconstitution, and Dispensing
ixazomib and lenalidomide are anticancer drug and as with other potentially toxic compounds
caution should be exercised when handling ixazomib and lenalidomide capsules.
7.12 Packaging and Labeling

7.13 Storage, Handling, and Accountability
7.13.1 Ixazomib
Upon receipt at the investigative site, ixazomib should remain in the blister and carton provided
until use or until drug is dispensed. The container should be stored at the investigative site
refrigerated (36°F to 46°F or 2°C to 8°C). Ensure that the drug is used before the retest expi[INVESTIGATOR_163775]/[COMPANY_005]. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_163776].
Ixazomib capsules dispensed to the patient for take-home dosing should remain in the blister
packaging and refrigerated as noted above until the point of use. The investigative site is
responsible for providing the medication to the patient in the correct daily dose configurations.
Comprehensive instructions should be provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance with
dosing procedures. Patients who are receiving take-home medication should be given only 1 cycle
of medication at a time. Patients should be instructed to store the medication refrigerated (36°F to
46°F or 2°C to 8°C) for the duration of each cycle. Patients should be instructed to return their
empty blister packs to the investigative site, rather than discarding them. Reconciliation will occur
accordingly when the patient returns for their next cycle of take-home medication. Any extreme
in temperature should be reported as an excursion and should be dealt with on a case-by-case
basis.
Because ixazomib is an investigational agent, it should be handled with due care. Patientsshould
be instructed not to chew, break, or open capsules. In case of contact [CONTACT_12698], raising
dust should be avoided during the clean-up operation. The product may be harmful by [CONTACT_12699],
ingestion, or skin absorption. Gloves and protective clothing should be worn during cleanup and
return of broken capsules and powder to minimize skin contact.
The area should be ventilated and the site washed with soap and water after material pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up is
complete. The material should be disposed of as hazardous medical waste in compliance with

efficacy in term of response rate between treatment (Id vs IRd) and NFKB2 rearrangement status in
relapsed patients with multiple myeloma. The potential maximum sample for this study is 90
patients. This novel design is a hybrid of two biomarker designs, i.e. the target/enrichment and
stratified/interaction design that was necessary to address comparisons based on experimental
regimens and the focus on non-responsive (absence of rearrangement) patients. Eligible patients
will be first screened by [CONTACT_163835]2 rearrangement status. The first [ADDRESS_190107] until the specific arm is closed. Randomization is conducted with a block of 2
patients in order to balance the enrollment in each arm (The first of the 2 patients entered
consecutively is randomly assigned to one of the 2 arms (Arm B or Arm C) with equal probability and
the second one is assigned to the other arm).
Within arms: Before the study is completed, the response rate of each arm is monitored separately
and compared to the historical RR of 30%. The Arm B is used as reference in the study, so that no
interim analysis is proposed for the arm and a total of [ADDRESS_190108] 80%
at the significance level of 0.05 to claim that Arm B has equivalent RR as the historical RR of 30%
assuming an equivalence tolerance of +/- 20% when the true RR of Arm B is approximately
30%.
Arm A or Arm C is designed to detect an improved RR of 60% vs. 30% using Simon’s 2-stage
Optimum design with a power of at least 90% and an alpha error of 5%., respectively. Ten (10)
evaluable patients will be enrolled into stage I. An interim analysis will be conducted after the
stage I. If 3 or less patients in the arm demonstrate objective response, then the arm is closed and
concluded with no potential better RR than the historical control RR of 30%. At least 4 objective
responses are required to proceed to stage II accrual of 20 additional patients for a total of 30
patients per arm. After the arm is closed with a maximum sample size of 30 patients, if 13 or less

or Arm C has 65% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_163780] 5% probability of declaring the treatment
effective if the true proportion is 30%. The probability of declaring the treatment effective is at
least 90% if the true RR is 60%.

Gene expression and - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).To assess for gene expression and transcribed
mutations associated with poor response to Id or IRd, we will extract RNA from plasma cells and
its corresponding normal counterpart using a Quiagen RNAeasy Kit. RNA quality will be
accessed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kits with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA-Seq
library preparation will be performed using a minimum of 100 ng of high quality(RIN≥8.0).
NGS from RNA will be performed in our Cancer Genomics Shared Resource
(CLIA#11D1086150). The RNA-Seq sample library preparation will be performed using the
Illumina TruSeq kit with assisted automation using Beckman Coulter's SPRIworks HT system.
All isolates will be individually barcoded, and RNA-Seq data will be generated using 100x100
paired end reads for each sample using an Illumina HISeq2000 instrument.

Confidential 87 09 December 2022Gene expression. All sequencing reads will be evaluated for quality using FastQC software.
Depending on the quality control metrics of the data, the reads might be trimmed using SeqTK
software. Following trimming, pair end reads will be aligned to reference human genome
(GRCh37/hg19) using BWA software. Expression counts per gene will be obtained using
Cufflinks software by [CONTACT_163836] (also known as fragments)
aligning concordantly within a pair and uniquely to a given gene. Differential gene expression
will be computed by [CONTACT_163837]-tests on the variance-stabilized counts followed by [CONTACT_163838]–Hochberg method.
Identify transcribed mutations.To determine the sequence of mutations associated with poor
response to Id or IRd, we will compare the mutational analysis of all samples against the results
obtained from time 0. To this end, we will first align paired-end reads using BWA pi[INVESTIGATOR_163781], inversions and other distant fusions within a single read
end using TopHat software. These distant splices provided one set of candidate fusions for the
subsequent testing stage. The other set of candidate fusions derived from: 1) unpaired unique
alignments, in which each end of the paired-end read aligned uniquely to a different chromosome,
and 2) paired reads, in which each end aligned uniquely to the same chromosome, but with an
apparent genomic distance that exceeded 200,[ADDRESS_190117] known transcripts
from RefSeq. We will require that both fragments flanking a distant splice, or both ends of an
unpaired or discordant paired-end alignment, map to known exon regions. This filtering step
eliminated approximately 90% of the candidates. For the goal of this project we will further
eliminate apparent read-through fusion events involving adjacent genes in the genome, which are
thought to be transcriptional rather than a genomic origin.
For the remaining candidate fusion events, we will construct artificial exon–exon junctions
consisting of the exons distal to the supported donor exon and the exons proximal to the supported
acceptor exon. The exons included in the proximal and distal computations will be limited so that
the cumulative length along each gene was within an estimated maximum insert length of [ADDRESS_190118] all exon–exon junctions consisting of combinations of exons
within the same gene, for all genes contributing to a candidate fusion event. We will extract reads
that aligned to an intergenic junction corresponding to a candidate fusion, but not to a control
intragenic junction.
To filter the results of the re-alignment, we require that each candidate fusion have at least one
read with an overhang of [ADDRESS_190119] each other using BWA and eliminate the fusion if the alignment had any region containing
60 matches in a window of 75 bp. We will also align the exon–exon junction against each of the
component genes and eliminate the fusion if the alignment had coverage greater than 90% of the
junction and identity greater than 95%.

Confidential 90 09 December 202211. ADVERSE EVENTS
11.1 Definitions
11.1.1 Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject administered
a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the
use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.
This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or
frequency since the administration of study drug.
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered
by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline.
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results indeath.
Islife-threatening(refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of
the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death ifit
were more severe).
Requires inpatienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324](see
clarification in the paragraph below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]).
Results inpersistent or significant disability or incapacity. (Disability is defined as a
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).
Is acongenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is amedically important event. This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be
immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious
when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical
or surgical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_190124] of an infectious agent. Examples of such medical
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious
particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy),
pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in
intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general
termsevereis often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself,
however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is
NOT the same asserious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability to
function. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For
example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe)
but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining
regulatory reporting obligations.
11.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures.
Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is
considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying
pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. For serious AEs, the investigator must
determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to study drug
administration. For serious pretreatment events, the investigator must determine both the intensity
of the event and the relationship of the event to study procedures.
AEs which are serious must be reported from the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_190125] dose
of ixazomib treatment or after the designated follow-up period that the sponsor-investigator and/or
sub-investigator considers to be related to any study drug must be reported. In addition, new
primary malignancies that occur during the follow-up periods must be reported, regardless of
causality to study regimen, for a minimum of three years after the last dose of the investigational
product, starting from the first dose of study drug. All new cases of primary malignancy must be
reported.

Each adverse event will be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE reporting. Each
investigative site will be responsible to report SAEs that occur at that institution to their respective
IRB. It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report serious adverse events as
described below.
For participating subsites, adverse events collected at weekly treatment visits are to be entered
into the EDC no later than 14 calendar days after data collection.
Subsites are not permitted to report directly to the coordinating center IRB or FDA. All external
site SAEs are to be reported to the coordinating center multi-site’s regulatory specialist. The
coordinating center multi-site coordinator will facilitate submission of external site SAEs to the
coordinating center IRB and FDA. All serious adverse events (SAEs) and other adverse events
must be recorded on case report forms. In addition, all SAEs must be reported to the coordinating

Investigator must complete and submit a PI[INVESTIGATOR_163786] [ADDRESS_190130] occur within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence, regardless
of the relationship of the SAE to ‘Study Drug.’ In the event that the participating investigator
does not become aware of the serious adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment
elsewhere), the participating investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_190131] (IRB) SAEs in

11.8 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies occurring while the participant is on study drug orwithin
28 days of the participant’s last dose of study drug should be reported immediately upon
investigator’s knowledge. If the participant is on study drug (Ixazomib and or lenalidomide, the
drug(s) are to be discontinued immediately and the participant is to be instructed to return any
unused portion of the study drug to the Investigator. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy,
or positive pregnancy test must be reported immediately of the Investigator’s knowledge of
the pregnancy. Reporting to Celgene as required by [CONTACT_163843] ® program for
patients taking lenalidomide. The patient should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.
The Investigator will follow the participant until completion of the pregnancy, and must report
the outcome of the pregnancy (including notification of false-positive tests) within 24 hours
of having knowledge of the event. Reporting to Celgene as required by [CONTACT_163844]® program.

for these activities.
12.7 Study Documentation and Archives
12.7.1 Source Documents
Source Documents are original documents, data, and records (e.g., medical records, data
collection forms, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments,
laboratory data) that are relevant to the clinical trial. The Site Investigator will prepare and
maintain adequate and accurate source documents. These documents are designed to record all
observations and other pertinent data for each subject enrolled in this clinical trial. Source
documents must be adequate to reconstruct all data transcribed onto the case report forms.

consent forms, medical records, case report forms, drug accountability records, all
correspondence, and any other documents pertaining to the conduct of the study for a period of 2
years after the investigation is discontinued.
12.8Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the Winship Cancer Institute will provide
oversight for the conduct of this study. The DSMC functions independently within Winship
Cancer Institute to conduct internal monitoring functions to ensure that research being conducted
by [CONTACT_163845]-quality scientific data in a manner
consistent with good clinical practice (GCP) and appropriate regulations that govern clinical
research. Depending on the risk level of the protocol, the DSMC review may occur every [ADDRESS_190140] 5 subjects being reviewed. Subsequent
monitoring will occur in routine intervals per the Winship Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
(DSMP) .
The DSMC will review pertinent aspects of the study to assess subject safety, compliance with
the protocol, data collection, and risk-benefit ratio. Specifically, the Winship Cancer Institute
Internal Monitors assigned to the DSMC may verify informed consent, eligibility, data entry,
accuracy and availability of source documents, AEs/SAEs, and essential regulatory documents.
Following the monitoring review, monitors will provide a preliminary report of monitoring
findings to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163789]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_163790]. Prior to
the completion of the final summary report, monitors will discuss the preliminary report responses
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163791] (when appropriate). A final monitoring summary report will
then be prepared by [CONTACT_2037]. Final DSMC review will include the final monitoring summary
report with corresponding PI [INVESTIGATOR_163792], submitted CAPA (when applicable), PI [INVESTIGATOR_163793], and available aggregate toxicity and safety data.
The DSMC will render a recommendation and rating based on the overall trial conduct. The PI
[INVESTIGATOR_163794].
Continuing Review submissions will include the DSMC recommendation letter. Should any
revisions be made to the protocol-specific monitoring plan after initial DSMC approval, the PI
[INVESTIGATOR_163795]. The Committee reserves the right
to conduct additional audits if necessary.
12.9 Study Monitoring and Data Collection for Participating sites
Following initiation of the study site, remote monitoring will be completed by [CONTACT_163846]. The Site Investigator will allocate sufficient time for the designated site staff
to submit source documentation as required to complete remote monitoring.
The purpose of trial monitoring is to verify the following:
The rights and well-being of human subjects are protected.
Emory University
Clinical Study ProtocolIXAZOMIB
Confidential102 09 December 2022The reported data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.
The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol,
amendment(s), ICH GCP, FDA CFR, and any other applicable regulatory requirements.
At the time of study initiation at a non-Emory site, the Emory Sponsor, Winship regulatory
specialist, and Winship research coordinators will perform a site initiation teleconference.
During this teleconference, the Emory team will review the study, enrollment, reporting, and
regulatory compliance. The participating site will have internal monitoring meetings. These
meetings, which will include the participating site investigator, the clinical research coordinator
and the regulatory affairs coordinator, will meet at least on a monthly basis to review and discuss
study data to ensure subject safety. The research coordinators will maintain a spreadsheet which
will be de-identified and will summarize all the patient data for subjects actively being treated on
the trial as well as a roadmap detailing pending tests/treatments for each individual subject. The
spreadsheet will be shared with the Emory PI [INVESTIGATOR_67078] e-mail.
Winship’s MSC will perform an on-site or remote monitoring visit within the first three months
of enrollment of the first subject. Quarterly monitoring visits will occur (once annually onsite
and three times remotely) until subject follow-up is terminated. Monthly reviews of data in
OnCore will be conducted to ensure compliance or identify discrepancies; specifically, to assess
compliance with the protocol, verify informed consent forms, verify compliance with SAE
reporting procedures, monitor the tracking of study drug (pharmacy visit, storage and accounting
of study drug), retrieve regulatory documentation, and perform quality control by [CONTACT_163847].
Study updates will occur at least once monthly between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163796](s). The purpose of the meetings is to discuss the enrollment, regulatory
updates, monitor toxicities, and evaluate the progress of the trial. Scheduled teleconferences
may stop after all patients have completed assigned protocol therapy. The coordinating center (or
designee) will communicate with participating sites via monthly email. The minutes from the
teleconference will be maintained in the regulatory binder for the study. In addition, electronic

Adapted from Durie BGM, et al. Leukemia 2006; 20: 1467-1473; All response categories (CR, sCR,VGPR,
nad PD) require two consecutive assessments made at anytime before the institution of any newtherapy;
complete response and PR and SD categories also require no known evidence of progressive or newbone
lesions if radiographic studies were performed. VGPR and CR categories require serum and urine studies
regardless of whether disease at baseline was measurable in serum, urine both or either. Radiographicstudies
are not required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed. For
progressive disease, serum M-component increases of≥I gm/dl are sufficient to define response if starting M-
component is≥5 g/dl.
IMWG clarification for coding PD: Clarified that Bone marrow criteria for PD are to be used only inpatients
without measurable disease by M protein and by [CONTACT_64391]. Clarified that 25% increase refers to Mprotein,
FLC, and bone marrow results and does not refer to bone lesions, soft tissue plasmacytomas orhypercalcemia.
Note the lowest response value does not need to be a confirmedvalue.

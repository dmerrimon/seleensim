Target subject population
The target populat ion includes male and female patients aged 18 years and older with 
docum ented ty pe 2 di abetes m ellitus and wi th a prior diagnosis of heart failure. Approximately 
330 patients with docum ented LVEF ≤45% and NT-proBNP >300 pg/mL will be rando mized 
in equal  proporti ons (110 patients per group) to treatment with saxaglipt in, sitaglipt in or 
placebo.  
Patients must have an estimated glomerular filtrati on rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2at 
screening to qualify for enrollment. The proporti on of rando mized patients with an eGFR of 
≥30 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2will be limited to 30% and rando mizat ion will be stratif ied to 
rando mize a maximum o f 99 patients (maximum 33 for each treatment group).  Patients whose

Duration of treatment
In this study , sites will perform a pre-screening assessment prior to the enrollment visit to 
determine if patients meet eGFR inclusio n criteria.  All potenti ally eligible patients will be 
enrolled for screening, provi de Inform ed Consent, and undergo screening for all applicable 
inclusio n/excl usion criteria. Patients can enter screening as soon as laboratory results for eGFR 
are available, provided the patient meets the inclusion/excl usion criteria. The total  duration of 
the pre -screening and screening periods should not exceed 28 days.
Patients with a recent (within 1 month) laboratory  results for eGFR that meet the protocol 
mandated criteria can enter the screening period directly without pre-screening procedures 
needing to be performed.
Patients who do not qualify for the protocol based upon their pre -screening or screening results 
may have addi tional attem pts to qualify. There may be no more than 3 attem pts in total. If the 
patient failed to qualify during screening period (including, but not limited due to study supplies, 
equipment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening visits, or out -of-
range laboratory /clinical tests), the patient may potenti ally be re-screened. These cases shoul d 
be discussed with the Ast raZeneca Moni tor and docum ented in the Invest igator Study  File (ISF). 
The Invest igator may use his/her judgment regarding the interval between screening periods. 
The Investi gator must track allattem pts in the form  of a log at the site. Screening will be 
followed by a 24-week randomized treatm ent period. Patients who complete the treatm ent 
periodwill be asked to return for an end -of-study  visit at Week 28.
Investigational product, dosage and mo de of administration
For patients rando mized to treatm ent with saxagliptin, saxagliptin 5mg tablets and sitaglipi [INVESTIGATOR_427361] a 24-week treatm ent period for 
patients wi th an eGFR ≥50 m L/min/1.73 m2.  For p atients wi th an eGFR <50 m L/min/1.73 m2, 
the dose of saxaglipt in will be adjusted to 2.5 mg.
For patients rando mized to treatm ent with sitagliptin, sitaglipt in 100 mg capsules and 
saxagliptin placebo tablets will be administered orally once daily  for a 24-week treatm ent period 
for pati ents wi th an eGFR ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2.  For pati ents wi th an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 
m2, the dose of sitagliptin will be adjusted to 50 mg. 
Saxaglipt in placebo tablets and sitaglipt in placebo capsules will be administered orally  once 
daily  for a 24 -week treatment period for patients rando mized to receive placebo.
Statistical methods
To demonstrate non -inferiority of saxaglipt in compared to placebo for the change fro m baseline 
to W eek 24 in LVEDV index with an assumed non-inferiori ty margin of 6.5 mL/m2 , (This is 
Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis

11(85)an estimate of the NI margin fro m publicat ion [Foster et al]) and assuming a standard deviatio n 
(SD) of  15 m L/m2, and at a 1 -sided significance level o f 0.025, approximately  88 pati ents will 
be needed in each treatment gro up to provide approximately 80% power (given a true difference 
of zero between saxaglipt in and placebo). Assuming that 20% of patients have a missing
endpo int assessment, a total of approximately 330 patients (110 patients in each of the 3 
treatm ent groups) must be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to saxaglipt in, sitaglipt in, and placebo.  
Note, that the actual NI margin for the study  will be calculated as 10% of  the overall  baseline 
mean LVEDV index across all treatm ent groups.  Non-inferiorit y will be demonstrated if the 
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in treatments (saxaglipt in minus 
placebo) is less than the NI margin.
Rando mization will be stratified by [CONTACT_427375] -[ADDRESS_540098] on the primary  endpoint. 
For purely  administrative reasons, the randomizat ion will also be stratified by [CONTACT_427376].
LVEDV index and other continuous variables collected at only  one visi t during randomizati on 
treatm ent period (LVESV index, LVEF, and LVM by [CONTACT_9268], etc.) will be analyzed using analysis 
of covari ance (ANCOVA) for the change from basel ine at Week 24, with term s for treatm ent 
group, eGFR category  (<50, ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2), SGLT -2 inhibitor use, region, and baseline 
value as covariates in the model. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated 
for the adjusted mean chan ges within each treatment group as well as for the differences in 
adjusted m ean changes between treatment groups.
NT-proBNP and other continuous variables co llected at more than one visit during randomized 
treatm ent period (biomarkers, HbA1c, body  weight, percent change of plasma volume by 
[CONTACT_427377], blood pressure, etc.) will be analyzed using a mixed -model repeated -measures 
(MMRM) approach with terms for treatm ent group, eGFR category  (<50, ≥50 mL/min/1.73 
m2), SGLT -2 inhibitor use, regi on, baseline value, time (each rel evant visi t), the interacti on of 
treatm ent and time, and the interaction of baseline value and time in the model.  Point estimates 
and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean changes within each 
treatm ent group, as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between treatm ent 
groups.  Biomarkers or data with extrem ely skewed distribut ion may be log transform ed prior 
to ANCOVA or MMRM analysis.
Plasma concentrations o f saxagliptin, 5 -hydroxy  saxaglipt in and sitaglipt in will be used to 
develop exploratory  PK/PD m odels, which may be reported separately from the clinical study  
report.
The efficacy analyses will be performed based on the full analysis set (FAS ). No m ultiplicity 
control  will be applied for t he statist ical comparisons.
Safety analyses for the doubl e-blind treatm ent period will be per formed using the safet y analysis 
set, including data after the addition of glycemic concomitant medication or change of heart 
failure concomitant medication.  Safety analyses will include, where appropri ate, descript ive

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Type 2 Di abetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive disease, characterized by
[CONTACT_427378].  CV 
disease is by  [CONTACT_427379] h diabetes ( Skyler et al 2009 ).  
Diabetes is also a significant and often underappreciated risk factor for the development of 
heart failure.  Diabetics are 2.5
 -
fold more likely to devel op HF than pat ients without di abetes, 
(Nichols et al 2004 ).  The pathogenesis o f heart failure among pat ients with diabetes is 
multifactorial with coro nary artery  disease, hypertensio n, diabet ic cardio myopathy, and 
extracellular fluid expansio n playing maj or contributory  roles (Foster et al 1998 , 
Gilbert and 
Krum 2015 ).  
Therapeut ic options for treatment of T2DM in patients with heart failure are more limited, as 
there is uncertaint y about the safet y of many diabetes therapi [INVESTIGATOR_427364].  There is a 
need for carefully performed studies to characterize the safet y of newer therapi [INVESTIGATOR_427365].

22 (85 )Saxaglipt in is a highly potent, select ive, reversible, and compet itive dipept idyl pept idase -4 
(DPP4) inhibitor.  DPP4 is the enzyme responsible for the inact ivation of glucagon -like 
pepti de-1 (GLP -1) and gastric inhibitory  polypept ide (GIP).  By [CONTACT_427380]4, 
saxagliptin potentiates active endogenous GLP -[ADDRESS_540110] ing glucose levels in patients with T2DM.  The clinical 
development program for saxaglipt in supports its effi cacy in a wi de range of pat ients with 
T2DM, as monotherapy , as add -on therapy  (to m etformin, a sulfo nylurea, a thiazo lidinedio ne 
(TZD), or i nsulin), and as init ial therapy in co mbination with metformin.  Saxaglipt in has a 
well-established safet y profile, w ith a low ri sk of hypoglycemia and weight neutralit y 
(Hirshberg et al  2014 ). Details on the efficacy  and safet y of saxagliptin can be found in the 
ONGLYZA™ prescribing information and Invest igator Brochure.  
Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes 
Mellitus (the SAVOR study) 
SAVOR was designed to invest igate the cardiovascular safet y of saxaglipt in.  It was a 
multicenter, randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled study in [ZIP_CODE] pat ients with type 2 
diabetes who had a history  of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events that followed pat ients 
for a median of 2.1 y ears. SAVOR enro lled 2105 patients (12.8%) with a prior history  of 
heart failure; 2576 (15.6%) had impaired renal function (eGFR ≤50 m L/min). The SAVOR 
study  met its primary  safet y object ive by [CONTACT_427381] -inferior to 
placebo for the primary  com posite MACE endpoint of CV death, n on-fatal MI, or non -fatal 
ischemic stroke; hazard ratio (HR) 1.00 (95% CI 0.89, 1.12).  However, superiorit y of 
saxagliptin versus placebo on the composite MACE endpoint was not demonstrated 
(p=0.986).  For the secondary  com posite endpoint of non -fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, CV death, 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_226360] (hHF), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n for unstable angina, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427366], no statistically  significant treatm ent differences were observed 
between saxagliptin and placebo ( HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.94, 1.11]; nominal p=0.662 for a 
difference between the 2 treatment groups).  However, for the hHF co mponent of the 
secondary  com posite endpoint, m ore events were observed wit h saxaglipt in treatment 
compared wi th placebo (3.5% [289/8280 p atients] versus 2.8% [228/8212 patients]; HR 1.27; 
95% CI 1.07, 1.51; nominal p=0.007).  There is no definit ive mechanism to explain the hHF 
findings in SAVOR.  No signal for heart failure was observed in preclinical studies, other 
studi es in the clinical devel opment program , or in post -market ing surveillance.  
No heart failure signal was observed in TECOS (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular Outcomes 
after Treatm ent wi th Sitaglipt in).  TECOS was a mult icenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled stu dy in [ADDRESS_540111] ion, nonfatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10929] (HR 
0.98 [9 5% CI 0.88 to 1.09]; p=0.99 for superiorit y; p<0.001 for non -inferiorit y).  Rates of 
hHF di d not differ between the 2 groups (HR 1.00 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.20]; p=0.98, Green et al 
2015 ).  Reasons for the lack of a heart failure signal in TECOS, compared wit h SAVOR, may 
relate to differences in pat ient populat ions, the ty pe of  background care provided, the

chance.   
1.1.[ADDRESS_540112] acebo -controlled, m ulticenter 
study .  Approximately 3 30 patients with T2DM and HF will be randomized in equal 
proporti ons (110 patients per group) to treatment with saxaglipt in, sitaglipt in, or placebo.  The 
study’s primary object ive is to exclude a meaningful increase in left ventricular end diastolic 
(LVED V) index of greater than 10% for saxaglipt in co mpared with placebo using magnet ic 
resonance imaging (MRI).  The rationale for choosing this endpo int is based on the findings of 
the Vildaglipt in in Ventricular Dysfunction Diabetes (VIVIDD) study .  VIVIDD wa s an 
echocardiographic study  performed in pat ients with HF and LVEF <40%.  The study  met its 
primary  endpoint of non -inferi ority between vildaglipt in versus placebo for a change in LVEF 
over 52 weeks, but unexpectedly  found that treatm ent wi th vildagliptin was associated with a 
significant increase in LVEDV and a trend towards an increase in left ventricular end systolic 
volume (LVESV, McMurr ay et al  2013 ).  For the present study , LVEDV index will be the 
primary  endpoint and cardi ac MRI, rather than echocardiography , has been chosen for the 
assessment of the primary  endpoint because of its high accuracy  and reproducibilit y (Grothues 
et al 2002 ). 
Events of hHF occurred at a consistent rate throughout the SAVOR study .  However, m ost of  
the difference in the rate of events between saxagliptin and placebo accrued in the first [ADDRESS_540113].  The MRI primary 
endpo int analysis will be conducted at 24 weeks (by [CONTACT_427382] -fourths of the hHF 
events in SAVOR had occurred) to also invest igate the potential for remodelling changes to 
occur.  
In addit ion to the saxaglipt in and placebo arms, there is another active antidiabetic treatment 
arm sitaglipt in.  Sitaglipt in has been chosen as a reference DPP4 inhibitor that has not been 
associ ated with an increase in hHF in TECOS. 
Sitagliptin
Sitagliptin is an orally  active DPP4 inhibitor that i s marketed as JANUVIA™ ([COMPANY_006] & Co) 
for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults wit h T2DM.  
Details on the efficacy and safet y of sitaglipt in can be found in the JANUVIA™ prescribing 
inform ation.

24 (85 )1.2 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
As stated in Sect ion 1.1, an exces s in heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427367].  However, a mechanism to explain these findings has yet to be identified and an 
increase in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427368].  Saxagl iptin and sitagliptin are effect ive anti -diabet ic agents that have been 
extensively  studied in clinical tri als, are approved worldwide, and have substant ial 
postm arket ing experience with well -established safet y profiles.  For information on 
saxagliptin, pl ease consult the respect ive Investigator Brochure; for sitaglipt in, please refer to 
its Product Label.
Benefit s related to parti cipat ion in this trial include close fo llow-up of  a pati ent’s diabetes and 
treatm ent wi th anti-diabetes agents that are both eff icacious and well tolerated.   While one of 
the three possible treatments is placebo, patients will cont inue to be treated with their current 
anti-glycemic regiments as background therapy .  Furtherm ore, appropri ate rescue therapy  for 
worsening glycemic con trol shoul d be implemented if required, as recommended in Sect ion 
[IP_ADDRESS] .  
Although the findings from SAVOR suggest that saxaglipt in therapy coul d potenti ally resul t 
in an increased risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266438], patients in this study  will be cl osely 
monitored for si gns and symptom s of worsening heart failure with frequent study  visits.  In 
SAVOR, therapy  with saxaglipt in was not asso ciated with an increase in CV death, 
myocardial  infarct ion, or stroke, even amo ng patients with baseline risk factors for hHF.  As 
previously discussed, sitaglipt in has not been associated with an increase in hHF.
Further, study  data on cardiac funct ion, biomarkers, and plasma vo lume may result in 
improved patient management, on both an individual and populat ion basis.
1.3 Study Design 
This is a multic enter, randomized, doubl e-blind, parallel group, placebo -controlled study  to 
investigate the effects of saxagl iptin on cardi ac dimensio ns and function, in patients with 
T2DM and HF with abnorm al systolic function from both ischemic and non-ischemic causes. 
Approximately 330 pat ients with docum ented LVEF ≤45% and NT -proBNP > 300pg/mL will 
be rando mized in equal  proportions (110 patients per group) to treatm ent with saxaglipt in, 
sitaglipt in, or placebo. The calculated sample size is expected to yield approximately 
88patients per group with complete data (ie, patients with anonmissing primary endpo int 
assessment). In this study , sites will perform a  p re-study  screening assessment prior to 
enrollment visit to screen for eGFR criteria. Patients must have an estimated glomerular 
filtrat ion rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2at pre-screening to qualify for enrollment. 
Following Inform ed Consent, all potenti ally eligible patients will be enrolled and undergo 
screening for all applicable inclusio n/exclusion criteri a. The pre -screening value of eGFR can 
be used to qualify  a pati ent for randomizat ion.

25 (85 )Patients can enter screening as soon as laboratory  pre-screening results for eGFR are available 
provi ded the pati ent m eets the inclusio n/excl usion criteria.  The total duration of the pre -
screening and screening periods should not exceed 28days. 
Patients with a recent (wi thin 1 m onth) eGFR value will be allowed to enter the screening 
directly wit hout pre -screening procedures performed.
Patients who do not qualify  for the protocol  based upon their pre -screening or screening 
resul ts may have addit ional attem pts to qualify . There may  be no m ore than 3 attem pts in 
total.If the patient failed to qualify during screening period (including, b ut not limit ed due to 
study  supplies, equi pment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening 
visits, or out -of-range l aboratory /clinical  tests), the pati ent m ay potentially be re -screened. 
These cases should be discussed with the Astra Zeneca Monitor and documented in the 
Invest igator Study  File (ISF). The invest igator may use his/her judgment regarding the 
interval  between screening periods. The Invest igator must track all attempts in the form of a 
log at the si te.Re-screened pat ientsshoul d re-sign informed consent on the re -screening 
visit. All procedures fro m screening period should be repeated.
The study  will com prise a pre -screening period (optional –see sect ion 3.3) and screening 
period that in total should not exceed 28days, a 24 -week randomized treatment period and a 
4-week fo llow up peri od.  After randomizat ion, patients will visit the study  site for study 
assessments at Weeks 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24.  Follow -up telephone calls will be conducted at 
Day 7, Week 3, and Week 9.  Patients who complete the treatm ent peri odwill be asked to 
return for an end -of-study  visit at Week 28.  The schedule of study  assessments i s shown in 
Table 2.
Study  treatm ent will be administered once daily , according to randomized treatment 
allocat ion.  For pati ents wi th an eGFR ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2, the doses of the acti ve treatm ents 
are as fo llows: saxagliptin 5 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg.  For patients with an eGFR <50 
mL/min/1.73 m2, the doses of the active treatments will be adjusted as fo llows: saxagliptin 2.[ADDRESS_540114] ion will be performed at baseline (<= 7 day s 
prior to randomizat ion), and at Week 24 (<= 7 days prior to Week 24) for all study  patients.  
The Week [ADDRESS_540115] protocol and will be centrally  read by  a core l aboratory .  
Changes in plasma vo lume will be measured using the Strauss formula, as has been utilized in 
the EPHESUS study  (Kalra et al  2002 ; Strauss et al 1951 ; Rossigno l PR et al  2011 ).
During the study , pati ents will  cont inue to receive their usual, stable treatment regimens for 
diabetes and HF as prescribed by [CONTACT_161009].  Medicat ions for di abetes and HF, 
including diuretic dose, should cont inue unchanged, unless there is a change in the patient’s 
clinical status.  Changes in diabetes and HF medications, including dose, must be recorded in 
the electronic case report form (eCRF).  In cases where doses of medications , including 
diuretics, requi re adj ustment, pati ents shoul d be encouraged to remain in the trial and

The study  will com prise a pre -screening and screening periods of up to 28 day s.  Study  
procedures and timing required during enrollment/screening period are indicated in the Study  
Plan, Table 2.      
At pre-screening and screening, consent ing patients are assessed to ensure that they meet 
eligibilit y criteria.  Pati ents who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study.
All patients will be required to provide consent to supply bio logical  samples for entry  into this 
study .  This consent is included in the main pat ient informed consent form. 
Patients who do not qualify  for the protocol  based upon t heir pre -screening or screening 
resul ts may have addit ional attem pts to qualify . There may  be no m ore than 3 attem pts in 
total.If the patient failed to qualify during screening period (including, but not limit ed due to 
study  supplies, equi pment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening 
visits, or out -of-range l aboratory /clinical  tests), the pati ent m ay potentially be re -screened. 
These cases should be discussed with the [COMPANY_008] Monitor and documented in the 
Invest igator Study  File (ISF). The invest igator may use his/her judgment regarding the 
interval  between screening periods. The Invest igator must track all attempts in the form of a 
log at the si te.Re-screened pat ients should re -sign informed consent on the re -screening 
visit. All procedures fro m screening period should be repeated
4.1.1 Pre-screening Informed Consent Form & Informed Consent Form (ICF)
The Pre -screening informed consent for Protocol D1680C00016 is an abbreviated document 
that explains the risks associated with the screening laboratory  tests for eGFR performed to 
assess qualification to the study . This docum ent will provide only general i nformation about 
the study , without the need to provide any specific details about the study  procedures, and 
risks or benefits fro m study  parti cipat ion.  The Pre -screening ICF will also document the 
patient’s consent to return to the enrollment visit (Visi t 1) in case they  are consi dered eligible 
for the study .

Patients will  be assessed to ensure that they  meet eligibilit y criteria.  Patients who do not meet 
these cri teria must not be enrolle d in the study .
4.1.6 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
Estimated GFR will be calculated from serum creatinine ( Scr) according to the Modification o f 
Diet in Renal  Disease (MDRD) form ula and the eGFR value will be provided wit h accuracy to 
two decimal places.
Estimated GFR will be calculated using the MDRD formula ( Levy  et al  2006 ):
eGFR (mL/ min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (S cr)-1.154x (Age)-0.203x 1.212 (if African American) x (0.742 if female) 
For the purpose of eGFR calculat ion the creatinine value will be provided with accuracy to 
two decimal places. 
The eGFR will be used for verification of patient eligibilit y criteria during pre -screening, and 
will also be calculated at randomization and visi t 6 (week 6), vi sit 8 (week 12) and visit 10 
(week 24).  It will also be used to determine the dosage of saxaglipt in and sitaglipt in at 
rando mizat ion and the need for dose adjust ment during the treatment period.  Please refer to 
Secti on 7.2.
Patients who, duri ng the course of the study , develop eGFR <50mL/min/1.73m2based on the 
central  laboratory  serum  creat inine value, will be scheduled for a fo llow-up visit (within 7 
days) to obtain a second central laboratory  serum  creatinine val ue and to repeat the cal culat ion 
of eGFR. If the repeat eGFR is still <50mL/min/1.73m2, the pati ent’s dose of IP will be 
adjusted. The pati ent m ust be invi ted for an addi tional visit to receive the down -titrated IP 
within [ADDRESS_540147] ment even if the eGFR subsequent ly increased sufficient ly to meet init ial 
requi rements for the 5 mg saxaglipt in and 10 0 mg sitaglipt in dosing regimen.  The 
IVRS/IWRS will be used to allocate the adjusted IP.
If at any  time the patient ´s eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m2and confirmed at a repeated 
calculat ion (the re -test shoul d be scheduled within 7 day s), the patient sh ould be discont inued 
from IP, see Secti on 3.9.1 .

Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study  are f ollowed up by  [CONTACT_150061] a s long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the CRF. 
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to request additional informat ion for any  patient with ongoing

60 (85 ) Descript ion of AE
The m aximum  intensity of an AE will be rated according to the following definit ion:
 Mild (awareness of sign of symptom but easily tolerated)
 Moderate (di scomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)
 Severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform  norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and se vere AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_72991] a in Sect ion 6.2.   An AE of severe 
intensity need not n ecessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only  a limi ted degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.

adverse event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there i s a

For SAEs causal, relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures 
and addit ional study  drug.  Note that for SAEs tha t coul d be associ ated wi th any study  
procedure the causal relat ionship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix A to the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_427394]: Have y ou had any heal th probl ems since the previous visit/y ou were 
last asked, or revealed by  [CONTACT_244970].  When 
collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis a nd each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol mandated laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be summarized in the 
clinical study  report.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  
values/vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any o f the SAE 
criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the invest igational product.

8 STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY [CONTACT_76383]
8.1 Statistical considerations
All personnel invo lved wit h the analysis o f the study  will remain blinded unt il database l ock 
and protocol vio lators ident ified.
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_244979].    
The SAP will be signed off before review o f any potenti al treatm ent revealing data is 
undertaken and any subsequent amendments will be do cumented, with final amendments 
completed pri or to unblinding of the data. If one or more stratification cells has sparse or no 
data, then, for purposes of the imputation and analysis models, stratification levels and/or 
variables may be combined or variab les may be dropped from  the m odels.
8.2 Sample size estimate
The comparison o f saxagliptin versus placebo in LVEDV index is used to estimate sample 
size.  The mean change from baseline in LVEDV index at Week 24 will be assessed 
comparing saxaglipt in versus the placebo treatm ent group.  The efficacy  assessment will  claim 
non-inferiorit y if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the adjusted mean 
treatm ent difference between saxaglipt in and placebo is less than the non -inferiorit y margin, 
whic h will be taken as 10% of the overall (all treatments combined) baseline mean value. For 
purposes of the sample size calculat ion, this number will be assumed to be 6.5 mL/m2. (See 
below)  
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 14 February 2020
69 (85 )A total o f 330 (110 each arm) eligible pat ients will be rando mized in a 1:1:1 ratio to: 
 Arm 1: Saxaglipt in  
 Arm 2: Sitaglipt in
 Arm 3: Placebo 
To dem onstrate non -inferiorit y of saxaglipt in co mpared to placebo for the change from 
baseline to Week 24 in LVEDV index within a non -inferiorit y margin o f 6.5 m L/m2, assuming 
a standard deviat ion (SD) of 15 mL/m2, and at a 1 -sided si gnificance l evel of 0.025, 
approximately  88 pati ents will be needed in each treatment group to provide approximately 
80% power (given a true difference of zero between saxaglipt in and placebo).  Assum ing that 
20% of patients will be missing an endpo int assessment, a total of approximately  330 patients 
(110 patients in each of the 3 treatment groups) must be randomized.
The non -inferiorit y margin estimate for the sample size calculat ion for LVEDV index is based 
on data from Foster et al 1998 , where the baseline LVEDV index is 65 ±13 (mean ±SD) 
mL/m2.  To exclude an increase in LVEDV index (relative to placebo) of greater than 10% of 
the baseline , the change seen with vildaglipt in in LVEDV in the VIVIDD study , the non -
inferi ority margin for these calculat ions is equivalent to 6.5 (65 × 0.10) mL/m2.

8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
The full analysis set (FAS) will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses. 
Efficacy analyses will also be conducted using the PP anal ysis set.  All primary and secondary  
analyses will be performed using values regardless of rescue or discont inuat ion of the study  
treatm ent. When pat ients have their final MRI measurements done at an ETD visit rather than 
at Week 24, these measurements wil l be used as the endpo int.  Sensit ivity analyses for the 
primary  and secondary variables will be performed using analyses that do not assume the data 
are missing at random and incorporate patients randomized and treated but with only baseline 
data.
All statistical co mpar isons will be tested at the alpha level o f 0.05 (two -sided) level.  No

The primary  analysis for LVEDV index ,mean change fro m baseline at Week 24 ,will be 
perform ed using analysis o f covari ance (ANCOVA), wi th term s for treatm ent group, eGFR 
category  (<50, ≥50mL/min/1.73 m2), SGLT -2 inhibitor use, region, and baseline value as 
covari ates in the m odel.  A m ultiple imputati on approach will be used to impute the missing 
values of LVEDV at Week 24 for all FAS subjects wi th a nonmissing baseline value . Point 
estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean changes 
within each treatm ent g roup, as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between 
treatm ent groups.  The NI margin for the study  will be calculated as 10% of the overall 
baseline mean LVEDV index across all treatment groups.  Non -inferiorit y will be 
demonstrated if th e upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in 
treatm ents (saxaglipt in minus placebo) is less than the NI margin.

72(85)8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)
Continuous variables co llected at only one visit during rando mizat ion treatment pe riod 
(cardi ac dimensio n and funct ion LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEF, and LVM by [CONTACT_9268], 
etc), will be analyzed using the same analysis o f covari ance (ANCOVA) approach used for 
the primary  variable.
Continuous variables co llected at more than one visit during randomizat ion treatment period, 
(NT-proBNP, etc), will be analyzed using a mixed -model repeated -measures (MMRM) 
approach wi th term s for treatm ent group, eGFR category  (<50, ≥50mL/min/1.73 m2), SGLT -
2 inhibitor use, region, baseline value, time (each relev ant visi t), the interacti on of  treatm ent 
and time, and the interaction of baseline value and time in the model.  Bio markers or data with 
extrem ely skewed distributi onsmay be log transfo rmed pri or to ANCOVA or MMRM 
analysis. 
Point estimates and 95% confid ence intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean changes 
within each treatm ent group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between 
treatm ent groups.  No mult iplicit y control  will be applied for the statistical co mpar isons.
8.5.3 Explorat ory analyses
For continuous variables (percent change of plasma vo lume by [CONTACT_427377], blood 
pressure, HbA1c (using values prior to rescue), body  weight, and bi omarkers, etc) collected at 
multiple visit s post -baseline, the same MMRM approach will be us ed.  For conti nuous 
variables (LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEF, and LVM, etc.) collected at one visit post -
baseline, the same ANCOVA model described for the primary variable will be used although 
multiple imputation of missing data may not be used .
Plasma c oncentrati ons of  saxagliptin, 5 -hydroxy  saxaglipt in, and sitagliptin will be used to 
develop exploratory  PK/PD m odels, which may be reported separately from the clinical study  
report.
In cases where the central measurement of HbA1C is not possible due to h emoglobin vari ants 
not com patible wit h the central assay , no val ue will  be centrally  collected and these subjects 
will be excluded fro m the HbA1c analysis.

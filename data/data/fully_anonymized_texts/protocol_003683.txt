Page 6 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] 2.0 Background/Scientific Rationale  106 
Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease that disproportionately impacts African 107 
American (AA) women. AA women have poorer asthma -related quality of life and h igher 108 
rates of asthma exacerbations, healthcare utilization and mortality  compared to 109 
Caucasian women. Further, AA women are less physically active than any other 110 
subgroup of adults, which may help explain the asthma health disparities, found 111 
between AA an d Caucasian women. Physical inactivity among individuals with asthma 112 
is associated with poor asthma control and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], greater health care 113 
utilization, and poorer quality of life. Given the connection between poor asthma 114 
outcomes and physica l inactivity, addressing physical activity (PA) among sedentary AA 115 
women with asthma is imperative. Physical activity demonstrated improvement in 116 
asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, quality of life and healthcare utilization. 117 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_555612] s, fewer than 25% of AA women with asthma engage in regular 118 
physical activity. The ACTION intervention: physic Al aCtiviTy In min Ority wome N [ADDRESS_729418] the feasibility, acceptability and 126 
estimate the efficacy of the intervention in a randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_16282] 80 127 
participants within a pragmatic community setting convenient for sedentary AA women.   128 
 129 
 130 
3.0 Objectives/Aims  131 
The proposed  study  has 5 aims  involving  a total of 135 sedentary  AA women  with 132 
asthma.   133 
 134 
NOTE:  Aims [ADDRESS_729419] been  IRB approved  and completed.  Only data analysis  of 135 
these  2 aims  are still occurring.  At this time,  I am requesting  approval  for Aim 3 which  136 
entails  pi[INVESTIGATOR_555613],  acceptability  and to 137 
estimate  the efficacy  of the ACTION  intervention.   138 
 139 
Aim 1: Use stakeholder  input  to modify  a validated  walking  intervention  for sedentary  140 
AA women  with asthma.  141 
 142 
Aim 1a: Conduct  focus  groups  in 30 sedentary  AA women  with asthma  to assess  PA 143 
barriers  and facilitators.  144 
 145 
Aim 1b: Adapt  a validated  walking  intervention  that addresses  the barriers  and 146 
facilitators  to PA unique  to sedentary  AA women  with asthma  obtained  from Aim 1A. 147 
 148 
 149 
Aim 2: Pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_555614]  (physicAl  aCtiviTy  In minOrity  womeN  with asthma)  150

 161 
 162 
Aim 4 : Modify and refine the video component of the intervention to address the 163 
asthma -specific barriers to walking in AA women with asthma.  164 
Aim 4 a: Conduct a focus group with an Asthma Advisory Council (AAC) that includes up 165 
to 15 AA women with asthma, to asse ss the appropriateness of the proposed asthma 166 
content, language and setting used in the videos.   167 
Aim 4 b: Adapt the video component of the intervention using an iterative approach to 168 
include appropriate asthma content, language and setting.  169

INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES  The focus population for this study is 283 
sedentary African -American (AA) women with asthma. All participants included in the [ADDRESS_729425] Enrollment  294 
Potential  participants  will be identified  using  3 methods:  1) Using  a validated  electronic  [ADDRESS_729426]  (EHR)  algorithm  (Appendix  4) that identifies  asthma  patients  with a high 296 
sensitivity  and specificity  (99%  and 96%,  respectively) [1];  2) From  healthcare  providers  297 
in internal  medicine,  pulmonary  and allergy/asthma  clinics  at UI Health ; 3) From  women  [ADDRESS_729427]  experience  using  this EHR  algorithm  at UIC for an ongoing  asthma  study,  304 
CAPriCORN  (ChairB  Protocol  #14111301 ). A HIPAA  waiver  will be obtained  for this [ADDRESS_729428]  306 
the potential  participants.  Two methods  of recruitment  will be used:  in-person  and 307 
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 11 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] mailings.  In-person  recruitment  will occur  in the UI Health  outpatient  clinics.  We will [ADDRESS_729429]  also been  identified  through  the EHR  asthma  algorithm.  A research  311 
assistan t(s) will come  to the outpatient  clinic  for the potential  participant's  appointment,  312 
obtain  verbal  agreement  from potential  participant's  doctor/provider  to approach  the 313 
potential  participant,  then approach  the potential  participant  and give a brief introd uction  314 
about  the study  and ask screening  questions  to assess  eligibility.  If eligible  and 315 
interested,  the study  will be introduced  to the potential  participant  and if interested  316 
scheduled  for a focus  group  session  (Aim 1) or the first study  visit (baseline  interview  317 
and initial  data collection)  which  will take place  in the Clinical  Research  Center  at UIC 318 
(Aim 2 and 3).  Alternatively,  the recruiter  and potential  participant  can set up another  319 
day or a phone  call to assess  eligibility,  describe  the study  and/or  schedule  the initial  [ADDRESS_729430]  via telephone.  If the potential  participant  doesn’t  [ADDRESS_729431]  in participation.  If 328

5.2 Healthcare provider identification  336 
In our second  selection  strategy,  a research  assistant  (RA) will work  closely  with 337 
healthcare  providers  who see a lot of patients  with asthma  in their clinics  (Internal  338 
Medicine,  Pulmonary  and Allergy/Asthma).   339 
1. The RA will go to Internal  Medicine,  Pulmonary  and/or  Allergy/Asthma  clinics  and 340 
introduce  themselves  to the healthcare  providers  and provide  them  a brief 341 
synopsis  of the research  study  (See  study  synopsis  V1 11_20_17).   342 
2. The RA will ask healthcare  providers  for potential  participant's  that have  [ADDRESS_729432] study  visit (baseline  interview  and initial  data 350 
collection)  which  will take place  in the Clinical  Research  Center  at UIC (Aim 3).   351

the group entirely.   948 
2. Questionnaires:  given that some questions ask personal information; it is [ADDRESS_729516] to answer any question they are uncomfortable 951 
with. 952 
3. There is also a chance for loss of privacy and loss of confidentiality in the unlikely 953 
event that unauthorized persons should see study data.  Many protections will be 954 
taken to de crease the chances that this happens.  955 
4. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (lung function test) : risks associated with spi[INVESTIGATOR_555627] [ADDRESS_729517] involves rapid and forced breathing, some people 957 
may experience temporary (lasting up to a few minutes) s hortness of breath, [ADDRESS_729518] soreness. In rare cases, the participant may 959 
hyperventilate and become dizzy during spi[INVESTIGATOR_555628]. Any participant who 960 
feels faint should be guided onto the chair with her head down towards the 961 
knee s, and encouraged to breathe slowly and deeply until she recovers. If the 962 
participant fails to recover normal breathing, faints, or reports feeling ill, the 963 
research assistant will  summon the CRC nurse  manager and physician 964 
immediately. The physician should always be consulted if there is any question 965 
regarding the participant’s safety status during the exam.  966 
5. Risk of pulmonary event: subjects will be asked to increase their daily physical 967 
activity  and will perform up to 15 minutes of walking during the intervention group 968 
sessions , so there is the possibility of a pulmonary complication, such as an 969 
increase in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (shortness of breath, cough, wheezing). We will [ADDRESS_729519] shown 971

 1031  
Aim 1: Focus Group Data Analysis /Quality Control  [ADDRESS_729527] focus group data are 1034  
entered and continue throughout the focus group phase. Drs. Nyenhuis and Sharp will 1035  
review focus group transcriptions to identify recurring themes especially those focused 1036  
on barriers and enablers to PA/walking and explore the distribution across the groups 1037  
by [CONTACT_555645].  In this manner, analysis will 1038  
consider the context of the responses including characteristics of the participants [5]. [ADDRESS_729528]. Sharp will meet to review the results and generate 1047  
independent suggestions  related to safe and effective PA with asthma and asthma - 1048  
related barriers and enablers to PA . This team will also address modifications specific to 1049  
asthma such as: 1) identification of asthma triggers (exercise, pollens, cold -air); 2) 1050  
adequate warm -up prio r to physical activity; 3) medication pre -treatment prior to 1051  
physical activity; 4) adequate cool -down after physical activity; 5) use of breathing 1052  
exercises. The group will review and rank order all suggestions for intervention 1053  
modifications. Final decisio ns will be determined by [CONTACT_555647]: Drs. 1054  
Marquez, Sharp, Moy, Wilbur and Nyenhuis. The resulting intervention will be used in 1055  
Aim 2  (Pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]) . 1056  
 1057  
Aim 2: Pre -pi[INVESTIGATOR_555632] : The qualitative data collected during pre -pi[INVESTIGATOR_555633] 1058  
include but not be limited to, measures of time to administer and recruitment, 1059  
exploration of variance on measures (ceiling and floor effects), formative evaluations 1060  
from group sessions and issues with data collection and entry. The asthma advisory 1061  
team will r eview all aspects of the pre -pi[INVESTIGATOR_555634], 1062  
logistics, or process of the intervention. No further modifications will be made and we 1063  
will proceed to obtaining IRB approval for the final aim of the study (Aim 3).  1064  
 1065  
Aim 3: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_555632]: The qualit ative data collected during pi[INVESTIGATOR_187060] 1066  
but not be limited to, measures of time to administer and recruitment, exploration of 1067  
variance on measures (ceiling and floor effects), formative evaluations from group 1068

study statistician.  1073  
  1074  
Aim 4:  Adapting Intervention tools:  Audio  recordings of the focus groups will be [ADDRESS_729529]. Wilbur (mentor on [CONTACT_555656]’ K award) and behavioral [ADDRESS_729530]. Sharp (primary mentor on [CONTACT_555656]’ K award) will meet to review the 1086  
results from the initial focus group meeting. The group will review and rank order all 1087  
suggestions for video modifications. Final decisions will be determined by [CONTACT_6283]. 1088  
Nyenhu is, Wilbur and Sharp. The resulting suggestions of asthma content, setting and 1089  
language will be used to develop the script for the videos working with an experienced 1090  
videographer and filming will begin.  1091  
 1092  
The relevant raw video footage will be presented at  the second focus group meeting . 1093  
The women will be asked to provide feedback (written and oral) on the selection of 1094  
video scenes from the raw video footage clips that are relevant to the added asthma 1095  
video content. The written feedback includes a scoring s heet for each video. Each video 1096  
will be scored two times. Once for relevance of the asthma content to engaging in 1097  
physical activity and second for the usefulness in stimulating group discussion. Each 1098  
score will be on a 5 -point scale from not relevant to ve ry relevant or not useful to very 1099  
useful. Field notes will be taken during the meeting and the session will be audio 1100  
recorded and subsequently transcribed. The field notes and meeting transcript will be 1101  
reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_555635]. The mean ratings of video 1102  
scenes’ relevance and usefulness will be calculated. The mean scores for eac h video 1103  
will be used as rationale for replacing unacceptable scores (<3) The suggestions for 1104  
scene inclusion will be reviewed and finalized with the m ulti-disciplinary research team 1105  
and reviewed with the videographer. The resulting video will be used in Aim 5.  1106  
 1107  
Aim 5: During the  third focus group the women will review the six edited videos and 1108  
provide feedback on the acceptability of the videos. Acceptability will be measured for 1109  
each video using a 4 -item summative evaluation using a 5 -point scale, which will 1110  
address overall sati sfaction, content and language used in each video. Open -ended 1111  
questions asked by [CONTACT_555648]’ thoughts on what their likes 1112  
and dislikes about the videos. This session will be audiotaped and transcribed.  1113

10.0 Data and Safety Monitoring  1120  
During this study, data and safety -monitoring will occur to to ensure the safety of study 1121  
participants and the validity of data in compliance with the National Institutes of Health 1122  
(NIH) requirement of Data and Safety Monitoring for Clinical Trials.  The Data and [ADDRESS_729531] has three  goals: (1) to insure the safety of 1124  
the participants; (2) to produce high  quality research while considering both risks and 1125  
benefits.   1126  
 1127  
This section outlines essential elements of the Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) for 1128  
this study .  1129  
a) Monitoring the Progre ss of the Trial and Safety of Participants: This study poses 1130  
minimal risk to the participants, as it involves getting the participant ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_158337] [ADDRESS_729532] exercise, walking. Drs. Sharp and 1132  
Nyenhuis will perform loca l monitoring of the progress of the trial and the safety of 1133  
participants.  1134  
 1135  
b) Plans for Assuring Compliance with Requirements Regarding the Reporting of 1136  
Adverse Events (AE):  1137  
Participants will be given the study office phone number (24 -hour coverage) to [ADDRESS_729533] study staff and/or investigators to report adverse events. All adverse events 1139  
will be reported to the IRB  and study sponsor (NIH) . 1140  
  1141  
Information about adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_555649] 1142  
monitored by [CONTACT_54465]:  1143  
• Report given by [CONTACT_555650], either in person or by [CONTACT_756].  1144

3569 ) as soon as possible.  1155  
• Drs. Nyenhuis or Sharp will complete the Adverse Event Report and submit the 1156  
completed form to the Human Subjects Committee of the University of Illinois at 1157  
Chicago and the NIH within 24 hours of learning of the adverse event.  1158  
• A copy of the adverse event form will be kept in the study file.  1159  
 1160  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ _____________________________  
[ACTION intervention ] Version [19] 
Page 32 of 38 [3-9-2020 ] Drs. Nyenhuis and Sharp will assess recruitment flow, attendance,  retention rates, 1161  
and AE summaries weekly during team meetings. Data from the focus groups will 1162  
be recorded and transcribed by a member of the research team for review by [CONTACT_6283]. 1163  
Nyenhuis  and Sharp. Procedures will be reviewed to insure that the data collected 1164  
are collected in a manner consistent with the confidentiality of the participants 1165  
involved.  1166  
 1167  
Monitoring the Progress of the Trial and the Safety of Participants .   1168  
Overall, the stud y poses minimal risk to participants.  A safety office will be named and 1169  
reports will be tendered every quarter to monitor progress and problems.  The report 1170  
provided to the safety office will including periodic assessments of data quality and 1171  
timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, 1172  
participant  complaints (if any), adverse events, and other factors that can affect study 1173  
outcomes.  Summaries of enrollment, attendance, and withdrawals will be reviewed.  If 1174  
we are not meeting our recruitment/retention goals we may consider the following [ADDRESS_729534] been used by [CONTACT_555651] -investigators in this patient 1176  
population such as: 1) Sending notes of appreciation, birthday cards or holiday cards; 2) 1177  
Small  tokens of appreciation. If a participant is unable to provide acceptable 1178  
accelerometer data (as described above) or is withdrawn from the study, a final letter 1179  
will be mailed to the participant (See Letter to participants that are withdrawn ). The [ADDRESS_729535] (IRB).  1187

11.0 Statistical Considerations  1189  
Aim 1: Focus Groups  [ADDRESS_729536] 160 women with the goal of recruiting a random samp le of 3 0 1191  
women. Participants will be selected to ensure representation of a range of variables 1192  
including asthma severity, current age and menopausal status . The sample size is 1193  
determined by [CONTACT_555652] 1194  
question are obtained, which is generally 1553. However, a minimum of 20 is 1195  
recommended for illness studies54. This study includes 30 participants in groups of 6 -10 1196  
for focus groups . If redundancy is not noted in the focus group discussion, additional 1197  
participants wil l be included until saturation is reached.   1198  
Qualitative analysis will occur after the focus groups. We will review focus group 1199  
transcriptions to identify recurring themes especially those focused on barriers and 1200  
enablers to PA/walking and explore the dist ribution across the groups by [CONTACT_343085] 1201  
such as asthma severity and age.  1202

 1217  
Aims  4 and 5: Adapting  Intervention  tools  1218  
We will recruit up to 15 AA women with asthma from our database of ~[ADDRESS_729539] already been identified as having asthma either through physician 1221  
diagnosis and/or the use of a  validated electronic health record (EH R) algorithm that 1222  
identifies asthma patients with a high sensitivity and specificity (99% and 96%, 1223  
respectively) [15, 16] . Potential participants will be contact[CONTACT_555653] g 1224  
questions to ensure they are still in our target age range of 18 -70 years. Participants will 1225  
be selected to ensure representation of age ranges. The sample size is determined by 1226  
the theoretical saturation or the point when no new ideas relevant to the qu estion are 1227  
obtained, which is generally 15 [17].  [ADDRESS_729540].  1232

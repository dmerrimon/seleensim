2.1 Background and Rationale
This study will compare upadacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of adult subjects with moderate 
to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).
HS is an inflammatory, debilitating skin disease with a characteristic clinical presentation of recurrent or 
chronic painful or suppurating lesions th at most commonly present in the axilla, inguinal, and anogenital 
regions .1,2  The estimated prevalence of HS varies between < 1% and 4%.3-7  It is a difficult to diagnose 
condition, and therefore, there is a significant delay (7.2 years on average) in establishing the diagnosis 
of HS after its initial presentation.8
HS lesions (i.e., nodules, abscesses, and sinuses) are painful, typi[INVESTIGATOR_320073], 
and can be malodorous with purulent discharge.  This constellation of signs and symptoms results in 
substanti al disability and social stigma of the patients and a profound impact on the quality of life.[ADDRESS_394916] on a patient's sexual health.10-[ADDRESS_394917] several comorbidities, s uch as obesity, 
metabolic syndrome, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn's disease, and polycystic ovary disease.2,[ADDRESS_394918] an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and all -cause mortality, and their risk of 
CV-associated death was shown to be higher than in psoriasis patients.16
Available treatment options for patients with HS include medical treatments such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_15385]-
antibiotics (e.g., exfoliants and peels), topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163] (e.g., clindamycin), systemic antibiotics (e.g., 
clindamycin, tetracycline, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]), anti -inflammatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., corticosteroids, dapsone, 
ciclosporin A), hormones (e.g., antiandrogens and estrogens), retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin, acitretin), 
biologics (e.g., adalimumab, infliximab), a nalgesics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), and surgical treatments (e.g., deroofing, excision, laser).[ADDRESS_394919] not been adequately studied in patients with HS or do not 
appear to be very effective through the course of the disease.  The only approved treatment option for 
patients with moderate to severe HS is adalimumab (Humira®), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α 
inhibitor.18  The results from Phase 3 studies with adalimumab, PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] I and II, showed approximately 
42% and 59% of subjects achieved Hidradenitis Suppurative Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12, 
respectively, versus 26% and 28% in placebo.[ADDRESS_394920] 50% of total 
abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count, without an increase in abscesses or draining fistula count 
relative to Baseline.19  Additional treatment options are needed for those patients who fail to achieve 
adequate efficacy.
The Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of intracellular tyrosine kinases that function as dimers in the 
signaling process of many cytokine receptors.20  The J AK family is composed of 4 members:  JAK1, 2, 3, 
and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2).  These cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases act in tandem to activate the signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) that transduce cytokine -mediated signals, and are 
assoc iated with multiple membrane cytokine receptors such as common gamma -chain receptors and 
the glycoprotein 130 trans -membrane proteins.20  The JAKs play a critical role in both innate and 
adaptive immunity, making them attractive targets f or the treatment of inflammatory diseases.21-24  
Page 7 of 105 
STUDY M20 -040  |  Version 2.[ADDRESS_394921] are 
elevated in HS, such as interleukin (IL) -2, IL-7, Type 1 interferons (IFNs), IFNγ, the IL -10 family, as well as 
IL-6.26,27  This suggests that JAK1 inhibition may be an effective target in the treatment of HS. 
Upadacitinib (Rinvoq®) is an oral, selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that recently has received 
approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the [LOCATION_002] (US), European Union (EU), 
Japan, and several other countries28,29and is also being developed for the treatment of other 
immune -mediated inflammatory disea ses, including dermatologic conditions such as atopic dermatitis 
(AD).  Positive results from a Phase 2b dosing ranging study with upadacitinib in adult patients with 
moderate to severe AD enabled advancement into Phase 3 AD registration trials that are cu rrently 
ongoing with 2 doses of upadacitinib, 15 mg and 30 mg.
Clinical Hypothesis
Proinflammatory cytokines identified in the lesional skin of HS patients signal via the JAK/STAT pathway.  
Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway with upadacitinib may decrease the high inflammatory burden in HS 
patients and improve clinical outcomes.  Upadacitinib should provide superior efficacy compared to 
placebo with an acceptable safety profile in subjects with HS.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
Increased expression of vari ous proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL -6, IL-7, and IL -15, IFNγ) has been 
described in affected HS skin; many of these cytokines signal through the JAK -STAT pathway.  This 
provides a strong rationale for evaluating upadacitinib in HS, a disease with a hig h unmet need due to 
very limited approved treatment options.  The efficacy of various JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib 
has shown promising results in various immune -mediated diseases including AD.  Common adverse 
events (AEs) reported to be associate d with the class of JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib, are 
infections, herpes zoster reactivation, and hematologic AEs.  Based on class labeling, serious infection, 
malignancy, and thrombosis were highlighted as a black box warning in the US package i nserts.[ADDRESS_394922] safety 
monitoring plan, including a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), Cardiovascular Adjudication committee 
and Gastrointestinal Perforation Adjudicatio n committee, is in place to ensure patient safety.
The results of genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; however, 
upadacitinib may be teratogenic, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in females of childbearing 
potenti al.  Based on an embryo fetal development study in rats, there is judged to be no risk associated 
with administration of upadacitinib to male partners of females of childbearing potential.
A detailed discussion of the pre -clinical and clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology, and safety 
experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure.
Taken together, the efficacy and safety data from upadacitinib studies to date show a favorable 
benefit:risk profile for upadacitinib and support the continued investigation of upadacitinib in patients 
with various autoimmune/inflammatory conditions including HS.  Upadacitinib as a new oral therapeutic 
drug could expand treatment options for patients with HS.

Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_320113], physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), 
imaging ,and clinical laboratory testing during the study.  Laboratory assessments will include 
hematologic parameters, chemistry, liver function tests, and lipid parameters.
3.5 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples w ill be collected from subjects at the visits indicated in Appendix D .  Using 
the data available from these subjects, a nonlinear mixed -effects modeling approach will be used to 
estimate the population central values and the empi[INVESTIGATOR_320075] (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F).  Additional parameters may be 
estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data.  Data from this study may be combined with data 
from other studies for the population PK analyses.
3.6 Biomarker Research Objectives
Optional blood samples (whole blood, serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]) will 
be collected as described in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D ) to evaluate known and or novel disease 
related or drug related biomarkers.  Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
cellular populations, and/or metabolites.  The objective of research is to analyze samples for biomarkers 
that will help to understand HS, related conditions, response to treatment with upadacitinib or similar 
compounds.  Research may also include changes in epi[INVESTIGATOR_7009], gene expression, and proteomics that 
may associate with HS, related conditions, or the subject 's response to treatment.  This research is 
exploratory in nature and the results may not be included with the clinical study report.

upadacitinib based on the current knowledge of this drug.  The study population selected reflects a 
population typi[INVESTIGATOR_320076].
Selection of Doses in the Study
This study will evaluate upadacitinib 30 mg QD.  The selection of this dose was informed by [CONTACT_320114], AD, psoriatic arthritis, and 
Crohn' s disease.  Due to a high inflammatory burden in the HS population, in general, higher dosing may 
be required to achieve optimal clinical response compared to other autoimmune disease indications 
such as RA.  Hence, upadacitinib 30 mg QD has been selected to establish proof -of-concept for 
upadacitinib in the treatment of HS in this Phase 2 study.  The adalimumab PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] I and II studies 
demonstrated that 40 mg every week resulted in better efficacy than 40 mg every other w eek (initial 
prescribed dose for most indications such as RA, plaque psoriasis, etc.).19  The results from Phase 2 dose -
ranging studies with upadacitinib in AD and Crohn 's disease showed upadacitinib [ADDRESS_394929] voluntaril y sign and date an informed consent , approved by [CONTACT_143617] (IEC)/institutional review board (IRB), prior to the initiation of any screening or

STUDY M20 -040  |  Version 2.[ADDRESS_394948] s who prematurely discontinue 
study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits as outlined in the 
Activity Schedule ( Appendix D), unless subjects have decided to discontinue study participation entirely 
(withdrawal of informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of 
their data even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early.  Followi ng discontinuation of study 
drug, the subject should be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment 
irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent)
If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the 
procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit should be completed as soon as possible, 
preferably within [ADDRESS_394949] is willing, a 30 -day follow -up visit (or phone call if a 
visit is not possible) after the last dose of study drug may be completed to determine the status of any 
ongoing AEs/serious adverse events (SAEs) or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
information on the subject's final status.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_394950]'s source documentation.
In the event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue 
unless the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped.  When [COMPANY_013] is informed that samples are 
withdrawn from research, samples will not be analyzed, no new biomarker analysis data will be 
collected, and the samples will be destroyed.  A subject may withdraw consent for optional biomarker 
research at any time and remain in the clinical study.  Data generated from clinical study and/or optional 
biomarker research, before subject withdrawal of consent, will remain part of the study results.
5.7 Study Drug
Study drug will be taken orally QD, beginning on Day 1 (Baseline), and should be taken at approximately 
the same time each day, with or wi thout food.  Subjects will be instructed to return all drug containers 
(even if empty) to the study site personnel at each study visit; study site personnel will document 
compliance.
Subjects will continue their disease -related concomitant medications ther apy as allowed per protocol.  
[COMPANY_013] will not supply any disease -related concomitant medication therapy taken during the course of 
the study.

5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_110990].  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_221004].  The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group 
assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_66771].
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups:
Upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 40)
Placebo (N = 20)
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_14181] -TNF u se prior to baseline and Hurley stage (< III or III).
Subjects in the placebo group will be switched to upadacitinib [ADDRESS_394953] and management of the trial (with the 
exception of [COMPANY_013] Dr ug Supply Management Team), the investigator, study site personnel, and the 
subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment through Week 12.  Sites and subjects will remain 
blinded for the duration of the study.  In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib tablets and 
placebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance.  The IRT will provide access to 
unblinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency.

5.9 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The investigator is responsible for complying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is identified), the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, 
regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].
In Japan, the investigator will record all protocol deviations in the appropriate medical records at the 
site.
5.10 Data Monitoring Committee
An external DMC composed of clinicians and statisticians independent of [COMPANY_013] and with relevant 
expertise in their field will review unblinded data from the ongoing stud y.  The DMC is responsible for 
safeguarding the interests of trial subjects, assessing the safety as well as for monitoring the integrity 
and interpretability of the trial.  The DMC will provide recommendations to the sponsor regarding 
ongoing trial conduc t, or modifications to the trial as described in a separate DMC charter.
In order to maintain sponsor blinding, an external Statistical Data Analysis Center is responsible for 
performing the analyses described in the DMC charter as well as additional analy ses requested by [CONTACT_320118], during or after DMC 
review.  
The DMC will regularly review unblinded safety data from the ongoing study according to the schedule 
provided in the DMC Chart er, including AEs, laboratory values and vitals sign values.
A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will further describe the roles and 
responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency and scope of the data reviews, and expectati ons for 
blinded communications.

STUDY M20 -040  |  Version 2.[ADDRESS_394956]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling dis crepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to AbbVi e 
within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an ab normal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or accidental 
exposure, off -label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be report ed 
whether associated with an AE or not.  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered 
an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see 
Section 6.2rega rding toxicity management), and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory co nclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has

during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, wh ether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (as appropriate) as an 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious AE (refer to Section 4.3 of the 
Operations Manual [ Appendix F] for reporting details and contact [CONTACT_3031]):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66748]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or a dmission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes wi th 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Import ant Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity ).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_394957] 
signs the study -specific informed consent.

The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_394960] consists of safety monitoring 
(review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodic/ad hoc review of safety issues by [CONTACT_120578]), and, if applicable, interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical 
management and/or discontinuation of the subjects from study drug.  The management of specific AEs 
and laboratory parameter s is described below.
For subjects who discontinue study drug but continue study participation and are on standard of care 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central 
laboratory) and any intolerability to standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_320099].
Serious Infections:   Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection.  Study 
drug may be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated.  S ubjects who develop active TB 
must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_176378].
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   If a diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed (other than due 
to appendicitis or mechanical injury), the subject must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ of the cervix must 
be permanently discontinued from study drug.  Information including histopathological results should be 
queried for confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects who 
are at increased risk for skin cancer.

Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:   For any given laboratory abnormality, the 
investigator should assess the subject, apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment 
following any local guidelines.  Specific toxicity manage ment guidelines for abnormal laboratory values 
are described in Table 3, and may require a supplemental eCRF to be completed.  For subjects with 
ongoing laboratory abnormalities which require data entry into an eCRF, an additional eCRF related to 
subsequent laboratory abnormalities is only required if the subject has relevant changes in history (e.g., 
new onset signs or symptoms) or laboratory values which have returned to normal reference range or 
its Baseline value followed by [CONTACT_320121] 
(considered a new event).  All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_320122] a satisfactory resolution.  If a repeat test is required per Table 3, the 
repeat testing is to occur as soon as possible.
Table 3. Specific Toxicity Management Guidelines for Abnormal Laboratory Values
Laboratory 
Parameter Toxicity Management Guideline
Hemoglobin  If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_320123] a new sample.
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline without an alternative 
etiology, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_111007].
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline and an alternative etiology is 
known or the hemogl obin value remains in the normal reference range , the 
subject may remain on study drug at the Investigator's discretion.
 If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value returns to 
normal reference range or its Baseline value.
ANC  If confirmed < 1000/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
 Interrupt study drug if confirmed < 500/μL by [CONTACT_111003].  
If value returns t o normal reference range or its Baseline value, restarting study 
drug is allowed if there is an alternative etiology identified; documentation 
should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe for the subject.  
Study drug should be discontinued if no alternative etiology can be found.

ALC  If confirmed < 500/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until ALC returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
Total WBC count  If confirmed < 2000/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until WBC count returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
AST or ALT  Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by [CONTACT_320124] a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or an international normalized 
ratio >1.5.
 A separate blood sample for international normalized ratio (INR) testing will 
be needed to measure INR at the time of repeat testing for A LT or AST.  A 
repeat test of INR is not needed for determination if above toxicity 
management criteria are met.
 Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by [CONTACT_320125], nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5% 
increase from Baseline). 
 Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 5 × ULN by [CONTACT_320126] 2 weeks.
 IfALT or AST > 8 × ULN , interrupt st udy drug immediately, confirm by [CONTACT_320127] , and contact [CONTACT_176454]. 
Subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of hepatitis B surface antibody status) and negative 
HBV DNA PCR testing at Screening who develop the following laboratory findin gs should 
have HBV DNA PCR testing performed within 1 week (based on initial elevated value): 
 ALT > 5 × ULN OR 
 ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily identified.
 A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the 
time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing will require immediate interruption of study 
drug (unless not acceptable by [CONTACT_111008]) and a hepatologist consultation should 
occur within [ADDRESS_394962] elevations > [ADDRESS_394963], comp lete the appropriate 
supplemental hepatic eCRF(s).

Serum Creatinine • If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the Baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test for 
serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results.  If 
the results of the repeat testing still meet this criterion, then interrupt study 
drug and restart study drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × Baseline 
value and ≤ULN.
For the above serum creatinine elevation scenarios, complete the supplemental renal 
eCRF.
Elective and Emergency Surgeries
For elective and emergency surgeries the following rules will apply:
If the subject must undergo emergency surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at the 
time of the surgery.  After emergency surgery, allow reintroduction of study drug once the 
physician has examined the surgical site and determined that study drug may be safely 
restarted.
Elective surgery, and interruption of study drug for such a surgery, will not be allowed until after 
the Week [ADDRESS_394964] 1 week prior to the planned surgery.  Allow reintroduction of 
study drug once the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that study drug 
may be saf ely restarted.
7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical methods provided in this protocol will be focused on primary and secondary analyses.  
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).
The Primary Analysis will be conducted after all ongoing subjects have completed Week 12, data 
pertaining to Period 1 has been cleaned, and a database lock has occurred for the purpose of e fficacy 
and safety analysis in Period 1.  The efficacy analysis performed based on this database lock is the only 
and final analysis for Period 1.  Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study.
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populati ons
The Intent to Treat (ITT) Population includes all randomized subjects.  Subjects will be included in the 
analysis based on treatment as randomized.  The ITT Population will be used for all efficacy analyses.
Page 34 of 105 
STUDY M20 -040  |  Version 2.0 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The following populations will be used for t he safety analysis:
The Safety Population in Period 1 (Safety_1) is defined as all subjects who are randomized and 
received at least one dose of study drug in Period 1.
The All Upadacitinib Treated (ALL_UPA) Population is defined as subjects who received a t least 
one dose of upadacitinib in the study.  This population will be used to provide a comprehensive 
summary of safety.
For safety analyses, subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment actually received.
7.[ADDRESS_394965].  For the primary analysis, Non -Responder 
Imputation while incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to COVID -19 (NRI -C)will 
be used to handle missing data.  Asupplementary analysis will be performed to compare upadacitinib 
30mg QD versus in -trial placebo group combined with unblinded placebo data from existing trials.
Secondary Efficacy Analysis
The secondary endpoint will be analyzed using the same method as for the primary endpoint.  In 
addition, analgesic use will be hand led as follows:
Prohibited analgesic (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]):  A subject will be counted as a non -responder from the 
day that the subject initiates prohibited analgesic to 5 days after the end of such analgesic use.
Protocol -allowed analgesic use:
A subject wh o enters the study without concomitant analgesic will be counted as a non -
responder from the day that the subject initiates a protocol -allowed analgesic to 2 days 
after the end of such analgesic use.
A subject who entered the study on a stable dose of a protocol -allowed concomitant 
analgesic will be counted as a non- responder from the first day of an analgesic dose increase 
to 2 days after the end of the dose increase.
Additional Efficacy Analyses
Details on additional efficacy analyses are provided in the SAP.
Subgroup Analysis for Efficacy
To evaluate the consistency of the efficacy over demographic and other baseline characteristics, 
summaries will be provided for the following subgroups for the primary efficacy endpoint.
Age group (< 40 years, ≥ 40 –< 65 years, ≥ 65 years)

Race (white, non -white)
Smoking (current, ex or never)
Body mass index (normal:  < 25, overweight:  ≥ 25 –< 30, obese:  ≥ 30)
Duration of HS (by [CONTACT_133763])
Prior exposure to TNF antagonists (yes, no)
Baseline Hurley s tage (II, III)
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety populations.  Subjects will be analyzed based on the 
treatment actually received.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing AEs will be tabulated 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ class and preferred term, as well as by 
[CONTACT_66774]. Summaries (including 
percentages and events per 100 patient years) of S AEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation will 
be provided as well.  For selected lab parameters, a listing of all subjects with any laboratory value 
above Grade 3 of Common Toxicity Criteria will be provided.  Mean change in laboratory and vital sig ns 
variables will be summarized. Additional details for the safety analysis will be provided in the SAP.
7.5 Interim Analysis
No formal interim analysis of efficacy is planned for this study.  Routine safety reviews will be performed 
by [CONTACT_113814] (see details given in Section 5.10 ).
7.6 Overall Type I Error Control
Not applicable for this study.
7.7 Sample Size Determination
The primary endpoint is the achievement of HiSCR at Week 12.  The primary analysis compares the 
proportion of subjects achieving HiSCR response to that of historical placeb o (25% HiSCR response).  
Assuming the Week 12 HiSCR response is 57% for the upadacitinib 30 mg arm, 40 subjects on 
upadacitinib will provide more than 95% power with a one -sample Chi-square test and one -sided alpha
=0.05 significance level.

previous screening testing, it is not required to repeat Screening testing for chemistry, hematology, 
urinalysis, and serum pregnancy provided that the subject's health status has not changed to warrant a 
repeat test.
3.[ADDRESS_394999] Information and Informed Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer 
all ques tions regarding this study.  Prior to any study -related screening procedures being performed on 
the subject or any medications being discontinued by [CONTACT_17204], 
the informed consent statement will be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_169265], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other 
signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the 
subject and the o riginal will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in 
the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any 
study -related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding benefits for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in 
the informed consent form.
Optional biomarker research samples will only be collected if the subject has voluntarily signed and 
dated a written consent form describing the exploratory research. The written consent may be part of 
the main consent form.  If the subject does not consent to providing optional sample s, the subject will 
still be allowed to participate in the study.
In cases of state of emergency or pandemic situations, it is possible that additional protocol 
modifications not outlined in this protocol may become necessary.  If this situation arises, in addition to 
the study informed consent, additional verbal consent may be obtained prior to these adaptations or 
substantial changes in study conduct in accordance with local regulations.  
3.[ADDRESS_395000]'s specific disease -related medical and surgical history will be recorded at Screening.  
History of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination status will be recorded as 
part of the medical history.  The subject 's medical history will be updated at the Study Day 1 visit.  This 
updated medical history will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
3.6 Adverse Event Assessment
Please refer to Section 4.2.
3.7 Patient -Reported Outcomes
Data Collection
Subjects will complete self -administered patient -reported outcome (PRO) instruments.  Subjects should 
be instructed to follow t he instructions provided with the instrument(s) and to provide the best possible 
response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other 
than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Site personnel will encourag e completion of the instrument 
at all specified time points and will ensure that a response is entered for all items.
PRO instruments that are administered at the site should be completed prior to drug administration and 
prior to any discussion of AEs or any review of laboratory findings.  The subject should complete the 
questionnaire(s) before site personnel perform any clinical assessments and before any other 
interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing the subject's response.
From at le ast [ADDRESS_395001] at Screening.  All data entered on the device will be 
immediately stored to the device itself, as well as automatically uploaded to a central server.  Analgesic 
use for HS -related pain will be collected from subjects during the same timeframe by [CONTACT_12550] a paper 
diary.  Data from the pain medication diary will be transcribed into the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system by [CONTACT_108575].
Data from the DLQI and HSIA will be collected electronically at the visits specified in Section 2.1.  
Subjects will use a tablet device at the site to enter the required pi[INVESTIGATOR_94470].  The electronic 
tablet device will be programmed to allow da ta entry for only the visits specified in the protocol and will 
not allow subjects to complete more than one of the same assessment at any one visit.  All data entered 
on the tablet device will be immediately stored to the devise itself and automatically u ploaded to a 
central server.
Page [ADDRESS_395002] visits may be conducted via phone or video 
conference.  Patient -reported outcomes (DLQI and HSIA) are eligible for completion at these virtual 
visits, except Baseline and Week 12.  If conducted by [CONTACT_320130], sites will read the PRO 
questions and response options to the subject and record the subject 's responses.  The subject's ability 
to view the PRO to understand the questions and response options should be preserved.  Sites may send 
the questionnaires (email or hard copy) to the subjects to allow them to read/understand the questions 
and responses when the subject is providing response s over the phone.  The date and time of PRO data 
collection should be recorded along with who collected the information.
Patient's Global Assessment of Skin Pain
The PGA Skin Pain (Appendix 7.1) will be used to assess the worst skin pain due to HS.  The scoring for 
PGA Skin Pain is based on an 11 -point numerical rating scale ( NRS), with ratings for the item ranging 
from 0 (i.e., no skin pain) to 10 (i.e., skin pain as bad as you can imagine).  Patients are asked to respond 
to the items based on a recall period of "the last 24 hours."  The weekly average score is calculated 
based on the [ADDRESS_395003] to the 
nominal day.
Hidradenitis Suppurativa Symptom Assessment Questionnaire
The HSSA (24 -hour recall) is a 9 -item PRO questionnaire (Appendix 7.2) developed to assess the primary 
symptoms of HS in the 7 consecutive days prior to assessments.  Each item of the HSSA is scored on an 
11-point (0 to 10) NRS, where [ADDRESS_395004]'s experience at a 
symptom level.  Additionally, Items 1 –[ADDRESS_395005] Assessment Questionnaire
The HSIA is an 18 -item PRO questionnaire ( Section 7.3) developed to assess the impact of HS on the 
daily lives of subjects in the 7 days prior to the assessment.  Items 1 –[ADDRESS_395006]'s experience at an individual impact level.  Additionally, Items 1 
–[ADDRESS_395007], item -level 
scores collected on the same day, and dividing that sum by [CONTACT_320131] 
(i.e., the Overall HSIA score is an average).  The Overall HSIA score will only be derived if eight or more 
(i.e., at least 50%) of responses are available (and adjusting the denominator to match the number of 
completed items).  Items 17 and 18 utilize an open field where patients are asked to fill in a number, and 
are not included in the Overall HSIA score.  Instead, a separate mean score for the hours worked (I tem 
17) or hours missed at school or work (Item 18) will be calculated.  If the response is "Not Applicable" for 
any of the Items 13 –14 or 16 –[ADDRESS_395008] will be deemed as "not applicable" for calculating 
scores.

The DLQI is a 10 -item validated questionnaire ( Section 7.4) used to assess the impact of HS disease 
symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QoL).   It consists of [ADDRESS_395009]'s QoL over the prior week, including symptoms and feelings, 
daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the side effects of treatm ent.  Each 
item is scored on a 4 -point scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much).  
Item scores are added to provide a total score, ranging from [ADDRESS_395010] 
4 points is considered the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).
3.8 Inflammatory Lesion Counts
The number of inflammatory nodules, abscesses, and draining fistulas, as well as the respective physical 
location (right/left axilla, right/left inframammary, intermammary, right/left buttock, right/left inguino -
crural fold, perianal, perineal, other) will be recorded at designated study visits outlined in Section 2.1.
3.9 Hurley Stage
The investigator will determine the Hurley Stage in each affected anatomical region at designated study 
visits outlined in Section 2.1.  Hurley stages are described as follows:
Stage I -Abscess formation, single or multiple, without sinus tracts and cicatrization
Stage II -Single or multiple, widely separated, recurrent abscesses with tract formation and 
cicatrization
Stage III -Diffuse or near -diffuse involvement, or multiple interconnected tracts and abscesses 
across the entire area
If more than one stage is present in a region, the worst stage in each region should be entered.  The site 
should make every attempt to have the same investigator conduct these assessments throughout the 
study for each subject.
3.10 Pharmacokinetic Sampling
Blood samples for the analysis of upadacitinib plasma concentrat ions will be collected from subjects 
throughout the treatment period on the study days specified in Section 2.1.
At Week 2 and Week 8 visits, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples should be collected prior to dosing and the 
subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample.  However, if 
the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study 
visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing schedule and the PK sample will be collected at any 
time during the visit.
Page [ADDRESS_395011] 2 study drug doses will be recorded on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF) to the nearest minute.
Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for detailed instructions on sample collection, processi ng, 
and shipment.
Measurement Method
Plasma concentrations of upadacitinib will be determined by [CONTACT_320132] a validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method.
3.11 Biomarker Research Sampling
Optional blood samples will be collected for biomarker research.  Refer to Section 2.1for the schedule 
of biomarker research sample collections.  All biomarker samples should be collected pre -dose.  All 
biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study -specific laboratory manual.  
[COMPANY_013] (or people or companies worki ng with [COMPANY_013]) will store the samples and data in a secure 
storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples may be retained while 
research on upadacitinib (or drugs of this class) or HS and related conditions continues, but fo r no longer 
than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirement.
3.12 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
For all subjects, a resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening, and if clinically indicated at any 
time during the study at the investigator 's discretion.  A qualified physician will interpret the clinical 
significance of any abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG.  If there are findings that are considered 
to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], the investigator must contact [CONTACT_320133] e TA MD before 
enrolling the subject.  In addition, any clinically significant findings will be documented in the source 
documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within [ADDRESS_395012]'s health status or medical history to warrant a repeat ECG.
3.[ADDRESS_395013] X- ray
CXR (posterior- anterior and lat eral views) is required f or all subjects at Screening to rule out the 
presence of TB or other clinically relevant findings.  The CXR will not be required if the subject had a 
previous normal CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) within [ADDRESS_395014]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any time during a study as warranted based o n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_320106].

absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB.  If the CXR 
demonstrates changes su ggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, api[INVESTIGATOR_320107]) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_320108].
The [COMPANY_013] TA MDmay approve substitution of computed tomography or MRI of the chest for the CXR 
in individual subjects.
3.14 Height and Weight
Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only (with shoes off).  Body weight will be measured at all 
scheduled visits, as sp ecified in Section 2.1.  All measurements will be recorded in metric units where 
applicable.
3.[ADDRESS_395016]'s medical history; 
abnormalities noted after the first dose of study drug will be evaluated and documented by [CONTACT_320134] o r not the abnormality is an AE.  All findings, whether related to an AE or part 
of each subject's medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
At any time, a symptom -directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by t he 
investigator.

For blo od sampling, subjects should be fasting (a minimum [ADDRESS_395018]).  If a subject is not able to fast 
the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
For any laboratory test value outside the reference range that the investigator consid ers to be clinically 
significant, the investigator should apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment per 
local guidelines:
The investigator will repeat the test to verify the out- of-range value.
The investigator will follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution.
A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from study drug or requires a subject 
to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE.

Pregnancy Tests (Serum and Urine)
A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible to enter the study or be allowed to continue 
study drug.
As described in the Contraception Recommendations section of the Protocol, females considered to be 
of non -childbearing potential should not have pregnancy testing performed.
A quantitative serum pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit and if any urine pregnancy 
test is positive.
The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by [CONTACT_2237].  If the serum 
pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure.  If the serum pregnancy test is 
borderline, it should be repeated ≥ [ADDRESS_395019] is:
Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;
Still borderline ≥ [ADDRESS_395020] can be enrolled into the study (unless prohibited per local requirements) in 
the absence of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_276024].
Page [ADDRESS_395021] dose of study drug (local practices may require serum pregnancy testing at Baseline).  
Additional urine pregnancy tests will be performed (as indicated in the Activities Schedule) at a 
minimum of monthly intervals (either at study visits or at home or at unscheduled visits between 
scheduled study visits).  The results of at home tests must be communicated to the site and recorded in 
source documentation.  More frequent pregnancy tests can be performed throughout the study at the 
investigator' s discretion or if required per local/country requirements.
If the Baseline urine pregnancy test is negative, then dosing with study drug may begin.
If the Baseline or post -Baseline urine pregnancy test is positive, dosing with study drug must be 
withheld and a serum pregnancy test is required (as stated above).
At each visit, the stud y staff should review the pregnancy avoidance recommendations with each female 
of childbearing potential and document this discussion in the subject's source records.
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)
FSH should be tested at the Screening Visit for female subjects who are ≤[ADDRESS_395022] no history of permanent surgical sterilization (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or hysterectomy).
Urinalysis
Urine samples will be obtained for urinalysis te sting at visits specified in Section 2.1.  The central 
laboratory will be responsible for performing a macroscopic urinalysis (urine dipstick) on th e collected 
urine specimens.  A microscopic analysis will be performed in the event the dipstick results show 
leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.
International Normalized Ratio
International normalized ratio (INR) will only be measured if ALT and/or AST > 3 × ULN.  A separate 
blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure INR at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.
Hepatitis Screening
All subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV and HCV at Screening.
HBV:
Subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV at Screening using the following tests:
HBs Ag
HBc Ab/anti- HBc
HBs Ab/anti- HBs
A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary.
A negative result for HBs Ag will trigger automatic reflex testing for HBc Ab and HBs Ab.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].A negative test result for HBc Ab does not require HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing and the 
subject may be enrolled ( Figure 1, Scenarios A and B).
For a subject who has had a HBV vaccination (should document in the medical history), a 
positive test result for HBs Ab is expected, the HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing is not required 
and the subject may be enrolled ( Figure 1, Scenario B).*
For subjects without a history of HBV vaccination (and where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]) a 
positive result for HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic reflex testing; Figure 1, 
Scenario B).
A positive test result for HBc Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic reflex testing) ( Figure 1, 
Scenarios C and D).  A result for HBV DNA that exceeds detection sensitivity will be considered positive 
and will be exclusionary.  A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may be enrolled.
Figure 1. Interpretation and Management of HBV Serologic Test Results
* Subjects who have had an HBV vaccination are expe cted to have a positive test result for HBs Ab and do not require HBV 
DNA PCR testing.  For subjects without a history of HBV vaccination (and where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]), a 
positive result for HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing.
** Where mandat ed by [CONTACT_5277], subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at Screening 
should have HBV DNA PCR testing performed approximately every [ADDRESS_395023] has a history of HBV vaccination and isHBs Ab+ and HBc Ab –.  If necessary, HBV DNA PCR may 
be tested at unscheduled visits.
HCV:
Blood samples for HCV serology will be obtained at the Screening Visit.  A positive HCV Ab will trigger a 
HCV RNA test.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate active Hepatitis 
C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti HCV Ab).
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Screening  
Subjects with HIV infection (positive HIV test) are excluded from study parti cipation.  An anti -HIV 
antibody (Ab) test will be performed at Screening, unless prohibited by [CONTACT_427].  The 
Page [ADDRESS_395024]'s health and subject should receive or be refe rred for clinical care promptly.  
[COMPANY_013] will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.
High -Sensitivity C -Reactive Protein (hsCRP)
During the study the hsCRP results starting after Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, 
investigator, study site personnel, and/or to the subject.  Results of hsCRP may unblind the treatment 
assignment or introduce bias, and the results may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby 
[CONTACT_320138] a safety assessment or AE management.  Any local testing of 
hsCRP or CRP during the study is therefore strongly discouraged and any local hsCRP or CRP tests
reported to the investigator during the study will be recorded as protocol deviations.
Tuberculosis (TB) Testing/TB Prophylaxis
All subjects must be evaluated for TB at Screening.  The results of the TB screening must be interpreted 
in the context of the subject's epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], history, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB.
At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk assessment 
questionnaire ( Section 7.5) and tested for TB infection as described below.  The site staff will complete 
the TB risk assessment question naire in its entirety (Part I and Part II) and enter the data into the 
appropriate eCRF.
Subjects with a negative TB test and CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled.  Subjects with 
history of active TB may be enrolled if it has been adequately tre ated with no evidence of current active 
TB; subjects with inadequate documentation of treatment should be cleared by a TB specialist prior to 
enrollment.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent TB, includin g 
signs and symptoms and CXR.  Subjects with latent TB (positive TB test with no signs or symptoms and a 
CXR not suggestive of active TB) may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see below).
Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enroll ed.
TB Testing:
The QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test should be performed at Screening on all subjects unless the 
subject is considered to be TB test positive prior to Screening.  The [COMPANY_003] skin test (also known as 
TB Skin Test or Mantoux test) should be utilize d when the QuantiFERON- TB Gold Plus test is not 
possible or if both tests are required per local guidelines.
If a subject had a QuantiFERON- TB Gold Plus test within [ADDRESS_395025]'s medical history to warrant a repeat 
test.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].For subjects with only a negative [COMPANY_003] Skin Test available within [ADDRESS_395026]'s medical history to warrant a repea t test.
For regions that require both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON- TB Gold Plus testing, both will be 
performed.  If either [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus is positive, the TB test is considered 
positive.
Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of Quan tiFERON- TB Gold Plus Test, [COMPANY_003] skin 
test, and/or history of latent or active TB are not required to repeat a TB test at Screening or 
during the study and should be considered TB test positive.
If TB testing is done at Screening for subjects with a prior po sitive TB test and a positive 
result is reported the subject is considered TB test positive.
If TB testing is done at Screening in subjects considered at low risk for TB as described below 
and a positive or indeterminate result is reported the procedure fo r "Interpretation of a 
positive TB test in low risk subjects "should be followed OR either prior or concomitant 
treatment for latent TB is required.
If performed, the [COMPANY_003] should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_395027].  The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of 
induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction.  The absence of indu ration 
will be recorded as "0 mm" not "negative."
Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to [COMPANY_003] in the past should not be re -exposed and 
the [COMPANY_003] should be considered positive and do not require subsequent testing with either [COMPANY_003] or 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus.
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a 
local QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to 
rule out a positive test result.  If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is 
considered to be positive for the purpose of this study.  If the testing result is negative, then the 
patient is considered to be negative.
Interpretation of a positive TB test in low risk subjects:  In case s where the QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold Plus test by [CONTACT_320139] (i.e., no risk factors identified using the Part I and Part II questions of the TB risk 
assessment questionnaire a t Screening) and has no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_110958], the investigator may 
perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory 
if not locally available) to confirm the positive test result.  If the repeat testing res ult is negative, 
the investigator may consider the test to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if the 
repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the test is considered positive.
An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) (such as T-SPOT TB test) may be 
substituted for the QuantiFERON- TB Gold Plus.
TB test(s) results will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
Page [ADDRESS_395028]'s medical history to warrant investigation and a repeat test during the study, the case (including 
the TB test results) should be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
TB Prophylaxis:
Note:  Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_320110].
At Screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection, prophylactic treatment with isoniazid 
must be initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug (or per local guidelines, 
whichever is longer) .  If receiving isoniazid prophylaxis during the study at least [ADDRESS_395029] be 
completed; however, the full course of prophylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose 
of study drug.
Subjects with a prior history of active or latent TB th at have documented completion of a full course of 
anti- TB therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical 
history to warrant repeat treatment.  Prior to the study, a full course of latent TB prophylaxis may be 
achieved with at least [ADDRESS_395030] should be re -evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and 
symptoms as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis.
At Screening newly diagnosed latent TB should be entered in the TB Screening eCRF; prior history of 
latent or active TB should be entered into the medical history eCRF.  Any positive TB test after the 
patient has started the study should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable).  
Newly initiated prophylactic treatment and prior therapy should be captured in the concomitant/prior 
medications eCRF as appropriate.
State of Emergency or Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
During a state of em ergency or pandemic situation, if travel restrictions or other changes in local 
regulations prevent the subject from having blood drawn for laboratory testing at the study site, if 
possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory work done at a local lab, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or other facility.  
Local lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and kept within the subjects' source 
documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_82674].
If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration may be continued provided the 
subject has at least [ADDRESS_395031]'s 
condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject should be treated in accordance with 
the investigator's best clinical judgment irrespective of whether the subj ect decides to continue 
participation in the study.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent)
Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (discontinuation of study drug treatment and study 
participation; withdrawal of informed consent) for any reason at any time.  If a subject prematurely 
discontinues study participation, the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD 
visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of study drug di scontinuation.  
In addition, a 30 -day follow -up visit (or phone call if a visit is not possible) should occur to determine the 
status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.  Subjects who discontinue the 
study prematurely after rando mization will not be replaced.
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation
Subjects may discontinue study drug treatment but may choose to continue to participate in the study.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug shoul d complete a Premature Discontinuation visit

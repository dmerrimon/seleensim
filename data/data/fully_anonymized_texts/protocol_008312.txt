 1 INTRODUCTION  AND  BACKGROUND  
1.1 DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS : DEFINITION , ANATOMY , AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) develops when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a deep vein.[ADDRESS_787114] frequently in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins, 
and less frequently in the anterior tibial and soleal/gastrocnemius  veins.3,4 Notably, the risk of subsequent 
embolization in proximal DVT is double that of isolated distal DVT.3 Hence, proximal DVT ha ve a less favorable 
prognosis.5 Regardless of the vein in which it forms, DVT tend to originate on the v enous endothelium in regions of 
sluggish blood flow above and below venous valves.2,5  
The pathophysiology of DVT has been attributed to three principal  risk factors: a change in blood flow in the form 
of venous stasis, endothelial injury, and blood hypercoagulability –  known collectively as Virchow’s triad.6 Stasis 
sufficient to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_596172], due to –  for example –  a long plane t rip or train 
ride, or secondary to a paralytic neurological injury.[ADDRESS_787115] a sevenfold greater 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_596173] -paralyzed leg.6 Relevant causes of endothelial 
injury include trauma, recent surger y, and intravenous drug use.7 Hypercoagulability can stem from inflammatory 
conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus o r inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, sepsis, previous 
thromboembolic disease, the nephrotic syndrome, or inherited or acquired thrombophilia.7-10 Additional risk 
factors that do not fit neatly into Virchow’s triad include pregnancy, oral contr aceptive use, cardiac disease, age 
greater than [ADDRESS_787116] multiple simultaneous risk factors. In one DVT patient cohort, 76 % of patients with DVT  
had two or more  risk factors, and 39 % had three or more.[ADDRESS_787117] formed, they often res olve – as least to some degree – on their own. Among one group of DVT patients, 86 % 
showed some degree of venous reopening (recanalization) within [ADDRESS_787118] into the pulmonary circulation, where they can cause a pulmonary e mbolism (PE). They 
also have the potential to enter the arterial circulation by [CONTACT_596188], or a patent foramen 
ovale.
[ADDRESS_787119]- thrombotic syndrome (PTS),  and the formation 
of recurrent  DVT. PE can lead to alveolar hyperventilation , diminished gas exchange, decreased pulmonary 
compliance, and increased airway resistance.2,8 This cascading chain of physiological derangements can eventually 
cause right heart failure, ultimately leading to death  in some cases.8 In PTS, incomplete recanalization after a DVT 
clot causes venous obstruc tion, which in turn results in venous hypertension. In response to this hypertension, 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_596174], which can cause localized edema, leg pain, eczema, and venous ulceration.
11 One additional complication of DVT is called phlegmasia cerulea dolens (blue, painful leg) in which a

 large DVT totally blocks arterial flow , yielding limb discoloration and ischemia, venous gangrene, and systemic 
hypovolemic shock.  
DVT result in PE in 15 to 32 % of cases, and PTS in 56 % of cases.12 Because it is so comm on for DVT and PE to 
present concurrently , they are sometimes considered to be part of a single disease entity: venous 
thromboembolism  (VTE) .2 In addition, DVT has a recurrence rate – from time of initial diagnosis – of 10 % at 1 year, 
24%  at 5 years, and 30 % at 8 years.5,12 The case fatality rate among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596175] 5 %, and 5 -
year mortality can be as high as 39 %.[ADDRESS_787121] to adverse drug events and 
nosocomial pneumonia.15 In Europe, VTE is estimated to kill 370 ,000 people every year –  a total greater than that 
caused by [CONTACT_596189], breast cancer, prostate cancer, and  automobile accidents combined –  and costs the continent 
roughly $3.7 billion annually.8,9,16 In the [LOCATION_002], there are a pproximately 2 million annual cases of DVT, 
which result in about 250 ,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355] 300, 000 deaths – more than those due to myocardial infarction 
or stroke.5,7,8 Even more Americans are at risk for DVT. Since about one quarter of DVT is acquired in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
close to 14 million hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_596176].8 All of this co sts between $9 billion and 
$[ADDRESS_787122]  persisting hypercoagulable comorbidities such as 
malignancy , guidelines recommend extended anticoagulation ( i.e., treatment without a scheduled stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213291]) .[ADDRESS_787123] commonly by [CONTACT_596190].3,5,21,22 Several different anticoagulants are used to treat DVT. Among these are various preparations of 
heparin – which works by [CONTACT_596191] –  and vitamin K 
antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin.19,21,[ADDRESS_787124] oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which inhibit 
either thrombin or factor Xa, are also available.[ADDRESS_787125] importantly, although anticoagulation therapy can help prevent new thrombi from forming, it is 
incapable of dissolving preexisting clots, regardless of which specific medication is employed.5 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_596177], PTS manifests in approximately 50 % of DVT patients within 2 years.24,25 Limitations 
specific to VKAs include a narrow therapeutic index, the need for routine coagulation m onitoring due to patients’ 
genetic variability, which can result in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic heterogeneity, and a large number 
of interactions with foods and other medications.5,23,[ADDRESS_787126] 12, 2020  
  
 
 
   
CLOUT Registry (Protocol 18 -001)       CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 39 
 teratogenic effects, limiting use in pregnancy or during nursing.21,23,27 DOACs, in turn, are contraindicated in 
patients with severe renal failure, and may increase the chance of gastrointestinal bleeding.23 Also, DOACs pose 
unique therapeutic drug monitoring challenges.23 And whereas VKAs can be reversed with vitamin K and 
prothrombin complex concentrate, only one out of the four  DOACs currently approved in the [LOCATION_002] is 
reversible.23 
Beyond anticoagulants, other DVT treatment modalities are available. Elastic compression stoc kings – which 
reduce the frequency of PTS – can sometimes be helpful, and the American College of Chest Physicians advises 
that they should be used in most  cases.18,28 However, 21.1 % of patients treated with stockings still go on to 
develop PTS.[ADDRESS_787127] anticoagulation 
alone, pharmaco -mechanical thrombol ysis does not diminish the risk of PTS, even though it does heighten the 
chance of major hemorrhage.19 For instance, the Acute  Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal with Adjunctive 
Catheter -Directed Thrombolysis (ATTRACT) study randomized  [ADDRESS_787128] the potential  to benefit from a safer and more effe ctive DVT 
treatment, which the Inari  Medical  ClotTriever Thrombectomy System has the potential to provide. The ClotTriever 
is a new treatment option that enables the extraction of extensive thrombi  from large vessels without the need for 
thrombolytic medic ations. It is an over -the-wire system uniquely designed to capture and remove significant 
occluding venous thrombi.

 5 OUTCOME  VARIABLES  
5.1 PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT  DEFINITION  
The primary safety endpoint is the rate of Major Adverse Events (MAE) . MAEs  are defined as a composite endpoint 
triggered when  any of four categories of events through 30 days after the index procedure , as observed in the 
Primary Analysis Safety Cohort : 
• All-cause mortality  
• Major bleeding  
• New s ymptomatic PE documented by [CONTACT_596186]  
• Rethrombosis of a  target venous segment (TVS)  
 
The components of the composite MAE endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_596193].  
5.2 PRIMARY EFFECTIVENESS ENDPOINT  DEFINITION  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is Technical Success , as measured in the Primary Analysis Effectiveness Cohort. 
Technical Success  is defined as complete or near complete (≥75%) removal of venous thrombus  from the TVS. The 
endpoint will be determined volumetrically by [CONTACT_596194] (pre -
intervention) venogram to the venogram performed after  use of the study device  but before  the use of other 
adjunctive treatment modalities such as  pharmacologic thrombolysis, other mechanical thrombectomy devices, or 
other intervention with pharmacologic or mechanical means .  Adjunctive therapy is defined as an additional 
thrombus removal strategy after ClotTriever thrombectomy has been completed (i.e.  balloon, stenting, and 
placement of IVC filters during ClotTriever procedure session would NOT be considered adjunctive therapy).  
5.3 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
The following secondary endpoints will be studied  in the Primary Analysis Cohorts : 
• Individual components of the MAE composite endpoint  through 30 days  
• Minor bleeding  through 30 days

performed on this datase t; the safety endpoint testing will be performed on the Primary Analysis Safety cohort  and 
the effectiveness endpoint testing will be performed on the Primary Analysis Effectiveness Cohort . 
• The Primary Analysis Safety cohort will include the first 91 subjects that enroll with a clinical presentation 
analogous to that used for the literature -derived performance goal  (i.e., unilateral acute or  subacute DVT

 6.3 POINT OF ENROLLMENT  
The ClotTriever System is not being used in an investigational manner and the patient will be treated with the 
device in the same manner regardless of whether the patient enrolls in the study . Therefore, the patient’s consent 
for treatment is covered under the institution’s internal procedures. To participate in the study, the patient must 
consent to share his/her deidentified personal health information (PHI)  with the study sponsor. This allow s sites to 
treat patients prospectively and consent patients after treatment. This can be helpful for sites when the research 
staff is unavailable to consent the patient prior to the index procedure (i.e., after hours, weekends, holidays). This 
practice is  allowed provided there is no institutional prohibition against post- procedure consent.  
Pre-procedure consents are the preferred consenting method and should be obtained within  [ADDRESS_787139] be obtained after  the patient gains full capacity after anesthesia and within 7 days of the index 
procedure.  
If the ClotTriever System does not enter the patient’s vasculature, the patient is considered  a screen failure and as 
such, his/her data is not to be entered into the database. A patient is considered enrolled when 1) the device enters the patient and 2) the patient consents to the study. The timing of the two events, index procedure and consent, are interchangeable.  
6.4 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
Subjects may be enrolled in the study if they meet all the following : 
6.4.1 Age ≥ 18 years  
6.4.2 Proximal lower extremity DVT involving the femoral, common femoral, iliac veins or inferior vena cava 
(IVC), alone or in combinationa

 7.2 BASELINE ASSESSMENT  
The Baseline Assessment  includes diagnostic testing , patient status, and eligibility verification for study 
participation  including : 
• Review inclusion/exclusion to ensure patient meets criteria  
• Review duration of symptoms  
• Confirm venous  thrombus presence on duplex ultrasound  
 
If the patient meets all eligibility  criteria and is scheduled  for the thrombectomy  procedure , the patient may be 
invited to participate in the study.  
The data captured for the Baseline  Visit may be gathered over the course o f more than one office visit; however, 
the data must have been obtained within  7 days  of the scheduled index procedure date  and, for subjects with 
symptoms of less than 7 days’ duration , after  the onset of symptoms . 
The following procedures will be performed at  Baseline  prior to the index procedure . All data must be recorded in 
the subject’s case report form s (CRF): 
• Demographic information  
• Medical history including risk factors  
• Physical examination  including an edema evaluation of both legsc 
• Presence of relative and absolute contradictions to pharmacologic thrombolysis  
• Anticoagulation Regimen  
• Duplex ultrasound assessment of  patency of the TVS 
• CEAP Score  
• EQ-5D, Villalta , rVCSS,  
• Edema and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)  
 
Clinical laboratory tests are expected to be performed at this visit to establish baseline levels  (i.e., creatinine, 
platelet counts , and INR if  subject  is on warfarin) . The panel of tests standardly performed at the institution for 
patients with similar c onditions  related to DVT should be considered . It is recognized that specific panels may vary 
between institutions. Laboratory data will not be specially analyzed but will be used to support adverse event (AE) 
evaluations.  
Subjects with bilateral DVT may b e enrolled. Each leg’s TVS will be counted separately in the 500- subject Full 
Analysis  dataset. The second leg may only be enrolled and treated at the time of the primary leg’s index 
procedure .

cines and IVUS images will be de -identified, labeled appropriately, uploaded  and sent  to the Core Laboratory . 
7.4 TARGET VESSEL SEGMENT (TVS)  ASSIGNMENT  
The target vessel segment (TVS)  is thrombus -containing venous segments, specified by [CONTACT_73693], that were 
treated with the  study device at the index procedure. These segments may include the popliteal vein, caudal 
femoral vein, cranial femoral vein, profunda/deep femoral vein, common  
femoral vein, external iliac vein, inter nal iliac vein, common iliac vein, or the inferior vena cava . The TVS does not 
include segments that were not intentionally treated but were instead passed through to remove the device from 
the leg.  
All vessels treated in one leg /side  are recorded under on e TVS.  There are three possible TVS designati ons: 
• For unilateral treatment: TVS 1 = Leg 1 and can be any or all segments from the IVC to the pop liteal  
• For bilateral treatment only : TVS 2 = Leg 2 and will not include the IVC (if the IVC was treated, record it as 
part of TVS 1)  
• For IVC treatment only : Neither leg was treated,  and the treatment was IVC only  (designate as TVS 1)  
 
d Ballooning and/or stenting  and/or I VC placement  during the procedure is routine and not considered adjunctive therapy. Adjunctive therapy includes thrombolysis and additiona l thrombectomy.

• Rethrombosis since leaving the procedure room  
• Reintervention since leaving the procedure room  
• AE observations  
• Blood transfusions  
• Edema and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)  
Thrombus removal interventions that are performed at the end of the index procedure prior to the subject leaving 
the procedure room will be reported as adjunctive procedures and  are not tabulated as reinterventions. In 
addition, before the subject has left the procedure room , formation of thrombus within  the treated TVS is not 
reported as a rethrombosis when it occurs during the index procedure.  
7.6 FOLLOW -UP ASSESSMENT S AND WINDOWS  
Follow -up evaluation will be scheduled at 30 days  (14-45 days), 6 months (46 -270 days), 1 year (271- 540 days), and 
2 years  (541- 900 days) post -procedure. The following assessments and procedures will be performed at each  
follow -up visit:  
• Physical examination of the target  proximal lower extremity( ies), including an edema evaluation of both legs  
• Anticoagulation regimen  
• Duplex ultrasound of TVS for patencye 
• Rethrombosis since the last visit  
• Reinterventions since the last visit  
• AE observations  that occurred since the last visit  
• Quality of life indices  (EQ-5D, Villalta, and rVCSS)  
• Edema and Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)  
 
7.7 PROCEDURES , REINTERVENTIONS , AND RETHROMBOSIS  
After  the index procedure , conditions warranting additional treatment may present. Any intervention taken to 
treat a condition involving the initially treated  TVS shall be documented.   Adjunctive therapy is defined as an 
 
e Duplex ultrasound will also be performed at unscheduled visits when the reason for the visit was pot entially a patency -related event.  The 
duplex ultrasound examination will specify whether each TVS was a) normal (compressible with flow), b) abnormal but patent (partially 
compressible with flow), or c) occluded (absent flow or incompressible). In the pre sence of a double femoral vein and when only one of the 
veins was treated, the sonographer must be certain to perform the duplex ultrasound assessment on the treated vein.

 o Rethrombosis in the absence of device induced vascular trauma (documented on an imaging 
study or with direct visualiza tion of the vessel) is not device -related; rather it is a complication 
related to ineffective anticoagulation therapy.   
o Perforation from the study device is device -related, but perforation from a non-study adjunctive  
device is not.  
o As well, events that o ccur as a result of downstream venous compression (e.g., May -Thurner 
syndrome) are not considered device -related.  
- Procedur e-related:  An event that is not device -related and occurs as a result of the procedure.  
o Events that  occur ≤30 days  of the index pro cedure or ≤ 30 days of a secondary procedure 
performed for a previous procedure -related complication, if the event is not device -related.  
o Examples include complications from ineffective anticoagulation (e.g. rethrombosis), excessive 
anticoagulation (e.g. bl eeding), or vascular access with a non -study device (e.g. generic sheath,

Therefore, the study will only  capture  AEs related to the subje ct’s DVT condition and its treatment. Reportable AEs 
include all  events considered in the safety analyses  (i.e.,  major or minor bleeding, access site complications, new

10 STATISTICS  AND  DATA  ANALYSIS  
10.1 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
The statistical design o bjective for this study is to evaluate patient outcomes of the study device, as assessed in 
comparison to literature -derived performance goals.  
The safety and effectiveness performance goals were determined from a literature review of publications on the 
treatment of DVT. A total of seven studies were included in this review and, among these, all publications reported 
data referable to the primary safety endpoint and six of the seven publications reported data referable to the primary effectiveness endpoint . Studies with populations that overlapped the population of another study were 
excluded. In general, these studies report data on acute and subacute DVT, but not chronic.  
10.2 PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT ANALYSIS  
The primary safety endpoint for this study will be assessed in the Primary Analysis  Safety  cohort  and is a composite 
endpoint of any MAE within 30 days, as determined by [CONTACT_596193]. The MAE is defined as  the 
30-day rate of all -cause mortality, major bleeding, new symptomatic PE documen ted by [CONTACT_596186], or rethrombosis of 
the target venous segment (s). The rate of MAE will be compared  to a performance goal with the following null and 
alternative hypotheses:  
H0:  P S ≥ PG S versus H A: PS < PG S 
where Ps is the proportion of subjects free from MAE through [ADDRESS_787159] binomial one -sided 97.5% confidence interval will be used to test the primary safety endpoint.  
10.3 PRIMARY EFFECTIVENESS ENDPOINT ANALYSIS  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is Technical Success, defined by [CONTACT_596197]. Thrombus removal is determined by [CONTACT_596198], measured after use of the study 
device but prior to the use of adjunctive devices. Effectiveness will be assessed in the Primary Analysis 
Effectiveness Cohort
f and will be compared to a performance goal with the following null and alternative 
hypotheses:  
H0:  PE ≤ PG E versus H A: PE > PG E 
where P E is the proportion of subjects with Technical Success, as defined complete or near complete removal of 
thrombus with the study device, defined by [CONTACT_596199] -determined reduction of ≥75% in the Marder score in 
 
f This dataset wa s designed to exclude those subjects treated who underwent venous thrombectomy for lesions that were non -thrombotic in nature. For instance, those with non -thrombotic May -Thurner lesions that have external 
compression or scar but who do not have demonstrable intraluminal thrombus. These subjects will remain in the Primary  Safety Cohort  and will be assessed for safety endpoints but will not be assessed for the effectiveness 
endpoints.

the published literature.  
10.4 STUDY SUCCESS CRITERIA  
The study will be considered a success if both primary endpoints meet their respective performance goals. For the 
safety endpo int, this translates into observing a one -sided 97.5% lower confidence limit (LCL) of the point estimate 
below 34% and for the effectiveness endpoint,  it means observing a one -sided 97.5% LCL above 30%.

tippi[INVESTIGATOR_596181].  
10.6 SAFETY PERFORMANCE GOAL DERIVATION  
The primary safety endpoint of 30 -day MAE was assessed from published studies that treated DVT with 
pharmacologic means or with other thrombec tomy devices .  The weighted average MAE rate was 23.8%. Using a 
10% margin and rounding to the nearest percent, the performance goal for the primary safety endpoint, 30 -day 
freedom from MAE, was  34%.  A detailed analysis of the safety performance goal will be described in the statistical 
analysis plan.  
10.7 EFFECTIVENESS PERFORMANCE GOAL  DERIVATION  
The primary effectiveness endpoint of Technical Success was assessed from published studies that treated DVT 
with pharmacologic means or with other thrombectomy device s). The weighted average Technical Success rate 
was 39.3%. Using a 10% margin and rounding to the next percent, the performance goal for the primary effectiveness endpoint of Technical Success was 30%.   A detailed analysis of the effectiveness performance goal 
will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
10.8 SAMPLE SIZE 
The performance goal of 34% has been established for the primary safety endpoint, based on a one -sided 97.5% 
exact binomial test. The 30 -day MAE rate is anticipated to be approximately 20 %. Under this assumption, the 
required sample size to achieve a level of 82% power is 86 subjects ( Table 2). Assuming 5% attrition over 30 days, 
enrollment of 91 subjects is necessary for the Primary Analytic Dataset.

A performance goal of 30% has been established for the primary effectiveness  endpoint. Anticipating an actual 
Technical Success rate of approximately 50%, and based upon a one -sided 97.5% exact binominal test, the 
required sample size to achieve a level of 97% power is 85 subjects ( Table 3). Since the primary effectiveness 
endpoint is determined at the time of the index procedure, no attrition has been considered for lost to follow -up 
or other censoring events. Howe ver, the effectiveness endpoint is evaluated in the Primary Analytic Effectiveness 
cohort , and it is assumed that 3% of enrolled subjects will be treated for DVT in the absence of core laboratory -
assessed visible thrombus in the TVS. Assuming a 3% attritio n rate for subjects without thrombus, enrollment of 88 
subjects will be necessary.

 The required sample size is greater for the primary safety endpoint; 91 vs. 88 subjects. Thus, a total of 91 subjects 
will be enrolled in the Primary Analysis dataset ; providing approximately 91  subjects in the Primary Safety cohort  
and 88 subjects in the Primary Effectiveness cohort  for the primary safety and effectiveness analyses, respectively. 
The overall power of the study is 80%.  
10.[ADDRESS_787165] aggregate Full Analysis  population will allow 
descriptive safety and effectiveness analyses on a larger dataset than would the Primary Analysis  dataset alone, 
with subgroup analyses as described in S ection 10.11.  
Subjects who do not fit the criteria for the Primary Analysis Dataset will be enrolled in the Full Analysis Cohort in 
parallel (see S ection 6.4). It is likely that the Primary Analysis Cohort will be enrolled before [ADDRESS_787166] 12, 2020

 10.11  SUBGROUP AND OTHER ANALYSES  
The following subgroups will be analyzed:  
• Acute  (≤14 days)  versus  subacute (>14 days ≤6 weeks)  versus chronic  (>6 weeks ) 
• Iliofemoral versus femoropopliteal  
• Men versus women  
• Old versus younger (≥65 years, <65 years)  
• Obese versus not obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, >30 kg/m2) 
 
10.12  DATA POOLABILITY  ASSESSMENT  
Poolability of data across clinical study sites is justified on a clinical basis (i.e. all study sites use the same protocol), 
the Sponsor monitors the site for protocol compliance, and the data gathering instruments are identical. The FDA 
also requires a statistical assessme nt of poolability. This is done by [CONTACT_596200]. For categorical baseline variables, such as sex, a generalized Fisher’s exact test or equivalent test will be used and for quantitative variables, parametric or n on-parametric analysis of variance (general linear models or 
an equivalent procedure) will be used.  
The above statistical analyses do not result in an impediment to pooling, but rather assess the balance of baseline 
covariates across study sites. If any ba seline covariate is found to be statistically significant by [CONTACT_223810], 
generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) will be used to assess site heterogeneity . This is done by [CONTACT_596201] a 
random effect and further quantifying the heterogeneity in terms of Hig gin & Thompson’s I
[ADDRESS_787167] enrollment equal to or greater than six subjects. This will be done in a ma nner to preserve the structure of the study and prevent bias.  
Baseline characteristics to be considered as possible covariates will include:  
• Age 
• Sex 
• Coronary artery disease  
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  
• Myocardial infarction  
• Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]  
• Cerebro vascular accident  
• Hypertension  
• Diabetes  
• History of tobacco use  
• Duration of symptoms  
• Isolated iliofemoral DVT versus iliofemoral and distal DVT  
• History of hypercoagulable state

 • Obesity  
 
If there are relatively few missing data points (e.g., <10%) for a given variable, a simple imputation using the mean 
(for continuous variables) or median (for dichotomous or categorical variables) of the non -missing values will be 
done. If there are >10% missing, the variable will be excluded from the imputation analysis . 
Poolability analysis will also be performed on the primary endpoints comparing across sites after adjusting for 
covariates difference. Logistic regression model will be utilized to include unbalanced covariates and site as an 
independent variable, and th e study outcome as dependent variable to assess outcome difference. If the p -value 
of site effect is less than 0.10, further analyses will be undertaken to investigate the imbalance of the study outcome.  
11 STUDY  MANAGEMENT  CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 DATA MANAGEMENT : CLINICAL DATA 
The Sponsor  and/or  designee  will be responsible  for the processing  and quality  control  of the data. All source 
data, CRFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_222978], correspondence, subject identification lists, informed consent forms, and other essential documents must also be retained for a period of at least 2 years after  study  
completion  or closure . 
No study  document  or image  will be destroyed without prior  written  agreement between  the Sponsor  and the 
Investigator  prior to conclusion of  the retention period  (see Section 12.4.2) . Should the Investigator  wish  to assign  
the study records to another party or move them  to another location, advance written  notice  must  be given  to the 
Sponsor.  
11.2 PROTOCOL MODIFICATIONS  
No changes from the final approved protocol will be initiated without the IRB’s prior written approval of the  
amendment. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_596182] .

when new staff become involved). The Investigator must ensure that all study staff members are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience, and training to perform their specific responsibilities.  
The Sponsor or designee  is resp onsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including the Investigator, and 
for ensuring their compliance with the protocol throughout the study. Additional information will be made available during the study when new staff become involved in the study, and as otherwise agreed upon with either 
the Investigator or the Sponsor or designee . 
 
12 STUDY  ADMINISTRATION  
12.1 SITE INITIATION  
A Site Initiation Visit (SIV) will  be conducted by [CONTACT_228546]-person or via teleconference to ensure 
proper training of the Investigator and study staff members regarding the study protocol and data collection, as 
well as to ensure regulatory requirements are fulfilled prior to enrollment of the first study subjec t at a site.  
12.2 STUDY MONITORING  
Interim monitoring visits may  be conducted by [CONTACT_596202]-person or remotely to ensure 
compliance with  the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines  according to the study -
specific monitoring plan.  
The main responsibilities of the M onitor are to ensure adherence to the protocol; to verify all data are correctly 
and completely recorded and reported; and confirm that informed consent is obtained and rec orded for each 
subject before any medical record or personal health information is shared with any study representatives . The 
Investigator and assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the M onitor  or Sponsor repre sentative  to resolve any 
study -related problems, errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during  these 
monitoring visits  or data review . 
12.[ADDRESS_787172] the right to terminate the entire study  or a specific study  
site at any time. Situations that could warrant study termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Increased incidence of adverse experiences and/or the severity of such, suggestive of a potential, device -
related health hazard  
• Insuffic ient subject enrollment  
• Recurrent protocol non -compliance, violations,  or deviations

 • Inaccurate, incomplete, and/or untimely data recording or query responses (> 5 business days) on a 
recurrent basis  
• Lack of cooperation with monitoring visits (e.g., failure  to adequately prepare for visits, address action items 
from one visit to the next, or provide access to medical records)  
12.4 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
12.4.1 Completing, Signing and Archiving Case Report Forms  
Clinical study data will be collected using electronic case report forms (eCRFs). A web -based electronic data 
capture (EDC) database will be used to record and manage study data. eCRF completion guidelines, the 
instructions for electronic data -entry will b e developed in conjunction with the Sponsor  and/or the EDC vendor. All 
eCRFs must be kept in good order and updated so they always reflect the latest observations on the subjects participating in the study.  
The Investigator will sign the appropriate eCRF pages and source documentation. Pertinent eCRF corrections will 
be made electronically and signed electronically by [CONTACT_737]. An embedded audit trail will capture the date, 
time and user making updates and changes to the electronic data.  
Because it is important to have proper data collection in a timely manner, within 5  business days  of the study 
visit/assessment , the Investigator/Study Coordinator shall complete the eCRFs. When the  Sponsor  or designee  
requests additional data or clarification of data for the eCRF, the request must be answered satisfactorily in a timely manner . 
12.4.[ADDRESS_787174] identification lists  (kept by [CONTACT_737]) , 
informed consent forms, and other essential documents must be retained for a period of at least [ADDRESS_787175] A ccess to Source Data/Documentation  
The Investigator must maintain, at all times, the primary records, (i.e., the original source of data/ source 
documents) of each subject’s data. Examples of source documents are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], office visit records, 
exam ining physician’s findings or progress notes, consultant’s written opi[INVESTIGATOR_72447], laboratory reports, imaging 
data, and CRFs that are used as the source.  
The Investigator may  keep a separate subject identification list showing enrollment numbers, names,  and dates of 
birth to allow unambiguous identification of each subject included in the study.  It is recommended a note be made in the medical record that the subject is participating in a clinical research study.    
The Sponsor, auditors, and health autho rity inspectors (or their agents) will be given direct access to source data 
and documentation (e.g., medical chart/records, laboratory test results, images ) for source data verification, 
provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accordance wi th local requirements.

 15 DEFINITIONS  
The following definitions will be used throughout the course of the study:  
Term  Definition  
Primary Safety Endpoint Definitions  
Target venous segments  
(TVS)  The thrombus -containing  venous segments, specified by [CONTACT_73693], that were 
treated  with the study device at the index procedure.  
• These segments may include the popliteal vein, caudal femoral vein, cranial 
femoral vein, prof unda/deep femoral vein, common femoral vein, external iliac 
vein, internal iliac vein, common iliac vein, or the inferior vena cava.  
• This includes  segments that were treated  with the study device, irrespective of 
the pre -procedure plan.  
• This does not  include segments that were not intentionally treated but were 
instead passed through to remove the device from the leg  
Primary Analysis 
population The first 91 s ubjects with uni lateral acute or subacute DVT of less than or equal to 6 
weeks’ duration, without recent (≤3 month) history of venous interventions.  
Major adverse event  
(MAE)  A composite of events through 30 days that include a ll-cause mortality, major 
bleeding, new symptomatic PE documented by [CONTACT_596186], or rethrombosis of a TVS  in 
the Primary Analysis  population.  
MAE: All -cause mortality  
(≤30 days)  Death from any cause, irrespective of relationship  to the device or to the procedure . 
MAE: Major bleeding  
(≤30 days)  Clinically overt  bleeding  that is associated by a fall in the hemoglobin of ≥ 5 g/dL, 
transfusion of ≥2 units of red blood cells, or involvement of a critical site (e.g. intracranial or int raspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]).  
• Hemoglobinuria is not considered to be clinically -overt and, as such, would in 
and of itself not constitute major bleeding.   
MAE: New s ymptomatic 
pulmonary embolism  (PE) 
(≤30 days)  New PE  accompanied by [CONTACT_596208], chest pain, or other localized 
symptoms referable to the event.   
• PE that is present at baseline but does not worsen  by [CONTACT_596209].  
• New, symptomatic PE documented with CTPA but without a baseline imaging 
study will trigger  the MAE.  
MAE: Target vessel 
segment (TVS) 
rethrombosis  
(≤30 days)  Occlu sive thrombosis of a TVS that occurs after patency had previously been 
restored  in the segment, documented by [CONTACT_596210], 
venography, computed tomographic venography, or magnetic resonance 
venography.  
• Rethrombosis requires ima ging documentation  of an open TVS  at the end of 
after the index procedure, with imaging documentation of occlusion of the segment thereafter.   
• Rethrombosis can be device -related (for example, from vascular injury caused 
by [CONTACT_19911]), or non  device -related (for example, from inadequate 
anticoagulation).

 Term  Definition  
Primary Effectiveness Endpoint Definitions  
Technical success  Complete or near complete removal of venous thrombus from the TVS, as 
determined by [CONTACT_596211].  
• When more than one venous segment is treated, the change in Marder score is calculated as the total score for  the treated segments prior to intervention 
with the study device (baseline score) minus the total score after treatment with the study device but before treatment with any adjunctive devices or 
pharmacologic agents (post- treatment score), divided by [CONTACT_941] b aseline score.  
Additional Safety Definitions  
Adverse event  (AE) An AE is an untoward medical occurrence or exacerbation of an existing medical 
condition subsequent to  treatment with the ClotTriever .  
Serious adverse event  
(SAE)  An adverse event that me ets at least one of the following: is fatal; is life -
threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure; results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613]  a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or necessitates 
medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
Device -related event  An event that can be directly attributed  to the use of the device, where in, if the 
device functioned 100% to specifications and expectations, the event would not 
have occurred.  
• Rethrombosis in the absence of device induced vascular trauma  (documented 
on an imaging  study or with direct visualization of the vessel)  is not device -
related; rather it is a complication related to ineffective  anticoagulation 
therapy.   
• Perforation from the study device is device -related, but perforation from a 
non-study adjunctive  device is not.   
• As well, events that occur as a result of downstream venous compression (e.g., 
May -Thurner syndrome) are not considered device -related.  
Proced ure-related event  An event that is not device -related and occurs as a result of the procedure.  
• Events that occur ≤30 days  of the index procedure or ≤ 30 days of a secondary 
procedure performed for a previous procedure -related  complication, if the  
event is  not device -related.  
• Examples include complications from ineffective anticoagulation (e.g. 
rethrombosis ), excessive anticoagulation  (e.g. bleeding), or  vascular access 
with a non -study device (e.g.  generic sheath, guidewire injury) ; distant 
complications (e.g.  myocardial infarction, pneumonia ); or contrast- induced 
complicat ions (e.g. contrast -induced nephropathy or hypersensiti vity reaction).   
Reportable adverse event  Reportable AEs include all ev ents considered in the safety analyses, all device - 
and/or procedure -related AEs, as well as any event resulting in death.  
Minor bleeding  Bleeding that does not meet the MAE definition for Major Bleeding.  
• Mild oozing that occurs at an access puncture site and uncomplicated 
hemoglobinuria are not reported  as minor bleeding events.

 Term  Definition  
Other Definitions  
Access site  The venous site used to gain access with the study device at the index procedure.  
Adjunctive Therapy  Per CLOUT protocol, adjunctive therapy is defined as an additional thrombus 
removal strategy after  ClotTriever thrombectomy has been completed  (i.e. balloon, 
stenting, and placement of IVC filters during ClotTriever procedure session would 
NOT be considered adjunctive therapy).  
Deep venous thrombosis  
(DVT ) Formation of thrombus within a deep vein, exclusive of non -thrombotic external 
compression or scarring of the wall.  
Acute (DVT)  Suspected timeframe of the onset of DVT is ≤14 days pre viously, as determined by 
[CONTACT_737].  
Chronic DVT DVT that, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], began more than [ADDRESS_787185] frequently in the posterior tibial and 
peroneal veins, and less frequently in the anterior tibial and soleal/gastrocnemius 
veins .  
Patency Primary patency means that you perform a procedure to restore patency to a 
vessel, and report how long patency is maintained without any repeat intervention.  
Primary -assisted patency defines the durability of an intervention that failed 
initially but not to the level of thrombosis and was retreated.  
Secondary patency means that the initial intervention failed to the level of 
thrombosis and was retreated. Once the second treatment was successfully 
performed, secondary patency defines the durability of that  second intervention.  
Proximal DVT  Proximal DVT is defined when the process involves the iliac, deep femoral, or 
popliteal veins.  
Subacute DVT DVT that, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], began >14 days but ≤[ADDRESS_787186] 12, 2020

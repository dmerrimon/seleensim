Protocol Title: The Safety and Tolerability of COMP360 in Participants with Post-
traumatic Stress Disorder
EudraCT Number: [ADDRESS_96471]:COMP360
ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier:[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Clinical Phase: II
Rationale: The Post -traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Psychopharmacology 
Working Group has recently called for novel, effective and efficient 
trauma -focused interventions and has labelled current treatment outcomes 
as “the Crisis in th e Pharmacotherapy of Post -traumatic Stress Disorder”.1
MDMA -assisted psychotherapy has recently received Breakthrough 
Therapy designation (BTD) by [CONTACT_88422], implying that 
psychedelic -assisted psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_88373]. Psilocybin therapy with 
COMP360 (COMPASS Pathways’ propri etary synthetic psilocybin 
formulation) has received si milar BTD for treatment -resistant depression, 
a condition often comorbid with PTSD.  It is therefore reasonable to 
obtain proof of feasib ility for COMP360 th erapy for PTSD.  If 
demonstrated safe and well to lerated, COMP360 therapy may offer a 
powerful alternative to MDMA -assisted psychotherapy in reducing PTSD 
symptoms.

Study Design and 
Procedures:This is a phase II, multicentre, fixed -dose open label trial. The study 
population will include adult men and women outpatients, 18 years of age 
and older meeting Diagnosti c and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(5thEdition; DSM- 5) diagnostic criteria for PTSD after a traumatic event 
experienced during adulthood. 
After signing the informed consent form  (ICF), participants will be 
assessed for their eligibility with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview , version 7.0.2 (MINI 7.0.2), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5
(PCL -5), Life Events Checklists for DSM-5 (LEC- 5), the Childhood 
Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating
Scale ( C-SSRS) . Those who meet the eligibil ity criteria will enter the 
screening period. Additionally, a medical history, an electrocardiogram 
(ECG), blood tests, and vital signs w ill be obtained. Participants will be 
offered the option of enrolling in the neuroimaging component of the 
study. Participation in this part of the study is optional , and participants 
who do not consent to neuroimaging will not be excluded from the study. 
If participants consent to neuroimaging , they will be assessed for 
additional eligibility criteria for the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
scan. 
During the screening period, participants who are on antidepressant 
and/or antipsychotic medications will be expected to complete taper ing of 
these medications at least [ADDRESS_96474] of these visits the 
participant begins tapering off their antidepressant and/or antipsychotic 
medications, if appropriate. The participant must complete the taper within the first 4 weeks of this peri od, prior to 2 weeks completely off 
antidepressant and/or antipsychotic med ications, before the baseline visit.
Section 10.[ADDRESS_96475] during screening .These are safety 
sessions and will contribute to th e participant’s preparation for the 
COMP360 administration session.
Protocol number: COMP [ADDRESS_96476]-traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 6 of 88
 
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June 2023  Participants discontinuing antidepressant and/or antipsychotic 
medications during the screening period w ill be evaluated for safety at the 
clinic weekly for a minimum of three weeks prior to COMP360 
administration to ensure safe discon tinuation of current antidepressant 
therapy required by [CONTACT_760]. Participants not discontinuing 
antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medications during the screening 
period will visit the clinic weekly for a minimum of two weeks prior to 
COMP360 administration . For all participants, preparation sessions with 
a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_88375] a 
final preparation session will take  place at baseline. Participants 
discontinuing antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medications mus t have 
completed washout before the first preparation session. Participants’ 
companions (carers, friends, or family members) may be educated about 
the signs of worsening of PTSD and su icidality and instructed on ways to 
contact [CONTACT_88423]. During these 
visits the C -SSRS, the M odified Discontinuation Emergent Signs and 
Symptoms Scale (mDESS), and any changes in medications since the 
previous visit will be obtained in addition to other assessments at the study 
clinician’ s discretion. The designated study team member will contact [CONTACT_88424].
The day before the administration session, the participants will undergo a 
baseline assessment ( 2 to 6 weeks after beginning screening period ) that 
will consist of the Clinician- Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5
(CAPS -5), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), EuroQuol- 5 Dimensions- 5
Levels ( EQ-5D-5L), C-SSRS, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale –Positive 
symptom subscale (BPRS+), Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma 
(PACT), Resilience Adult Scale (RAS), a semi -structured interview on 
the management of their PTSD, vital si gns, urinalysis, urine drug screen, 
and urine pregnancy test (only for women of childbearing potential). After 
baseline data are collected and entered in the Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) , the Clinical Assessment Technologies Team (CAT) team will
complete a final review to ensure the participant’s continued eligibility. 
Participants cannot be progressed to the administration session until this 
approval is received. Full descriptions  of the activities carried out during 
the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_88376]. Those who 
agreed to take part in the optional neuroimaging component of the study 
and met the eligibility criteria  will be offered an MRI scan .To reduce 
participant burden on baseline visit, th e MRI scan can be organised within 
[ADDRESS_96477] Manual. After the acute effects of 
COMP360 pass, participants will complete the Five-Dimensional Alt ered 
States of Consciousness ( 5D-ASC), and will be evaluated for safety and 
accompanied home. On the following day,  participants will be seen in 
person for a safety check, assessment of suicidality, and to discuss their 
experience during the dosing session (integration). During this visit,

Background
COMP360 is COMPASS’ proprietary formulation of synthetic psilocybin. Psilocybin 
belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics (meaning ‘mind manifesting’). 
Specifically, psilocybin is considered a 5-hydroxytryptaminergic (serotonergic) psychedelic, along with other tryptamines su ch as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ergolines 
such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and phenethylamines such as mescaline.
Study Rationale
PTSD is a serious debilitating condition, highly impactful on quality of life, resulting in 
diminished cognitive and psychosocial functi oning, fractured relationships, inability to 
maintain employment, substance abuse, high  healthcare utilisation costs, increased 
depression, and suicide risk. People who experience PTSD relive their traumatic experience(s) through nightmare s and flashbacks, have difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and feel 
detached or estranged. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_88379], there 
are currently no effective treatments for PTSD.
1
International guidelines recommend psychological interventions (such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy or eye movement  desensitisation and reprocessing) as first-
line treatments for PTSD followed by [CONTACT_88428], aiming to improve 
mood and reducing hyperarousal.
3,4Serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are 
recommended by [CONTACT_88429]-line tre atments, but despi[INVESTIGATOR_88380], about 40% of those with PTSD will not improve after treatment.5
The PTSD Psychopharmacology Working Group has recently called for novel, effective and efficient trauma-focused interventions a nd has labelled current treatment outcomes as 
“the Crisis in the Pharmacotherapy of Post -traumatic Stress Disorder” .
1MDMA-assisted 
psychotherapy has recently been designated as a Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD)by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for PTSD, implying that psychedelic-assisted 
psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_88381] p atients than the current standard of care.  
COMP360 therapy has received similar BTD for treatment-resistant depression, a condition often comorbid with PTSD. It is therefore reasonable to obtain proof of 
feasibility for COMP360 for PTSD. If demo nstrated to be safe and well tolerated, 
COMP360 may offer a powerful alternative to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in reducingPTSD symptoms.

Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June 2023  In this study, the aim is to assess the safety  and tolerability, and explore efficacy of 
administration of a single dose of COMP360 25 mg under supportive conditions in 
participants with PTSD.
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacokinetics of a different form of psilocybin (non-COMP360) were studied in 
12 healthy adult subjects who received single oral doses of 0.3, 0.45, or 0.6 mg/kg at
minimal intervals of [ADDRESS_96516] pass 
dephosphorylation of psilocybin to its active metabolite, psilocin. Plasma exposures of psilocin were linear within the dose range  tested and the elimination half-life of psilocin 
was 3 h (standard deviation [SD] ± 1.1 h). Variati on in psilocin exposure was not predicted 
by [CONTACT_18694]; therefore, a fixed oral psilocybin dose of 25 mg is expected to result in psilocin exposure (based on the area under the curve [AUC] and C
max) similar to that 
demonstrated after an individualised 0.3 mg/k g oral dose. At the 0.3 mg/kg dose, the AUC 
was 140 Pg h/L (interquartile range [IQR] 102  - 175), the plasma psilocin C maxwas 16 
Pg/L (IQR 14.5-17.2) and T maxwas 2.03 h (1.15 - 2.07). No psilocybin was found in plasma 
or urine, and renal clearance of intact psilocin accounted for less than 2% of the total 
clearance. An extended elimination phase in  some subjects suggests potential for 
hydrolysis of psilocin glucuronide metabolite.
Available results of COMP360 and previously p ublished information on different forms of 
psilocybin from in vitro assays and rodent studies demonstrate broadly similar 
pharmacokinetics to human studies after a single dose.
The subjective intensity of the psychedelic ef fects of a different form of psilocybin (non-
COMP360) have been shown to c orrelate with plasma levels of psilocin and its levels of

Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June 2023  Results from COMPASS’ completed trial in heal thy volunteers (COMP 002, EudraCT 
number: 20180999878-30) suggests that COMP360 is generally well tolerated. There were 
no SAEs and no AEs led to study withdrawal. In total, 511 TEAEs were reported over the 
12-week study duration across the 89 participan ts. Of the 511 TEAEs, the majority had an 
onset and resolution on day 1. Of the 403 TEAEs that started on the day of dosing, 343 (85.4%) were resolved the same day.

This study will evaluate a 25 mg single COMP360 dose administered under supportive 
conditions. 
Carhart-Harris- successfully evaluated tw o oral doses of psilocybin (non-COMP360) (10 
mg and 25 mg) administered seven days apar t to patients with unipolar TRD. Minimal AEs 
were reported in this study.

Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June [ZIP_CODE] STUDY PLAN
Study Design
This is a phase II, multicentre, fixed-dose ope n label trial. The study population will include 
adult men and women outpatients, 18 years of age and older meeting Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5thEdition; DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for PTSD 
after a traumatic event ex perienced during adulthood. 
After signing the informed consent form (ICF), participants will be assessed for their 
eligibility with the Mini International Ne uropsychiatric Interview, version 7.0.2 (MINI 
7.0.2), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Life Events Checklists for DSM-5 (LEC-
5), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) a nd the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS). Those who meet the eligibility criteria will enter the screening period. 
Additionally, a medical history, an electroc ardiogram (ECG), blood tests, and vital signs 
will be obtained. Participants will be offer ed the option of enrolling in the neuroimaging 
component of the study. Participation in this part of the study is optional, and participants who do not consent to neuroimaging will not be  excluded from the study.  If participants 
consent to neuroimaging, they will be as sessed for additional eligibility criteria for the 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. 
During the screening period, participants who are on antidepressant and/or antipsychotic 
medications will be expected to complete tap ering of these medications at least [ADDRESS_96526] of these visits  the participant begins tapering off their 
antidepressant and/or antips ychotic medications, if appropri ate. The participant must 
complete the taper within the first 4 weeks of this period, prior to 2 weeks completely off 
antidepressant and/or an tipsychotic medications, before the baseline visit. Section 10.[ADDRESS_96527] during screening. These are safety sessi ons and will contribute to the participant’s 
preparation for the COMP360 administration session.
Participants discontinuing antidepressant a nd/or antipsychotic medications during the 
screening period will be evaluated for safety at the clinic weekly for a minimum of three 
weeks prior to COMP360 administration to ensure safe discontinuation of current 
antidepressant therapy required by [CONTACT_760]. Participants not discontinuing 
antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medicati ons during the screening period will visit the 
clinic weekly for a minimum of two week s prior to COMP360 administration. For all

Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –[ADDRESS_96529] at baseline. Participants 
discontinuing antidepressant  and/or antipsychotic medications must have completed 
washout before the first preparation session. P articipants’ companions (carers, friends, or 
family members) may be educated about th e signs of worsening of PTSD and suicidality 
and instructed on ways to contact [CONTACT_88431]. During 
these visits the C-SSRS, the Modified Di scontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms 
Scale (mDESS), and any changes in medications  since the previous visit will be obtained 
in addition to other assessments at the study clinician’s discretion. The designated study 
team member will contact [CONTACT_88432].
The day before the administration session,  the participants will undergo a baseline 
assessment (2 to 6 weeks after beginning sc reening period) that will consist of the
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DS M-5 (CAPS-5), Sheehan Disability Scale 
(SDS), EuroQuol-5 Dimensions- 5 Levels (E Q-5D-5L), C-SSRS, BPRS+, Perceived 
Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT), Re silience Adult Scale (RAS ), a semi-structured 
interview on the management of their PTSD, vi tal signs, urinalysis, urine drug screen, and 
urine pregnancy test (only for women of childbe aring potential). After baseline data are
collected and entered in the Electronic Da ta Capture (EDC), the Clinical Assessment 
Technologies Team (CAT) team will complete a final review to ensure the participant’s 
continued eligibility. Participants cannot be  progressed to the administration session until 
this approval is received. Full descriptions  of the activities carried out during the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_88382].  Those who agreed to take part to the 
optional neuroimaging component of the study and met the eligibility criteria will be 
offered an MRI scan. To reduce participant bu rden on baseline visit, the MRI scan can be 
organised within [ADDRESS_96530] Manual. After the acute effects of 
COMP360 pass, participants will complete th e Five-Dimensional Altered States of 
Consciousness (5D-ASC), and will be evaluated for safety and accompanied home. On the 
following day, participants will be seen in  person for a safety check, assessment of
suicidality, and to discuss their experience duri ng the dosing session (integration). During 
this visit, participants will complete a semi-structu red interview on the acceptability of the 
therapeutic intervention and the severity of PTSD symptoms will be evaluated using the 
PCL-5. All sessions between the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] a nd the participant may be audio recorded, and 
the administration session may be video recorde d, for research, adherence monitoring, and 
quality assurance. Audio and video recording of  the sessions are subject to participant 
consent. Participants who do not consent to either or all recordings will not be excluded from the study.

where the designated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_88387]. More details on the preparation sessions are in the Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_88388].
Once a participant completes all screening assessmen ts and all screening data is entered into 
the EDC, the Medical Monitor, and CAT Team will review data entered and issue approval, if 
the patient is eligible. Once approval is issue d, the participant should then be invited for a 
screening V1a visit. The V1a visit is the point at which the patient begins tapering off their 
antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medications , if appropriate. The part icipant must complete 
the taper within the first 4 weeks of this peri od, prior to 2 weeks comp letely off antidepressant 
and/or antipsychotic medications, before baseline. The tapering period used in the study is set 
at the industry standard for depression trials. T he study team will complete telephone check-

Premature Discontinuation
If a participant’s participation in the study is terminated prematurely for any reason, the reason 
for such ET should be documented and the V10 (EOS) procedures should be performed as 
noted in  Section 7.2.10.
A termination form should be completed for every participant who is enrolled, whether the 
participant completes the study or not. The r eason for any ET should be indicated on this form; 
as much information should be provided as possi ble. The primary reason for a participant 
discontinuing early should be selected from the following standard categories of ET:
xScreen Failure: Participant does not qualify to participate in the study.
xLack of efficacy
xAdverse Event : Clinical or laboratory events occurred  that, in the medical judgment of the 
investigator for the best interest of the par ticipant, are grounds for discontinuation. This 
includes serious and nonserious AEs regardless of relation to the IMP.
xDeath: The participant died.
xWithdrawal of Consent : The participant desired to withdraw from further participation in 
the study in the absence of an investigator-d etermined medical need to withdraw. If the 
participant gave a reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded.
xLost to Follow-up : The participant stopped coming for visits and study personnel were 
unable to contact [CONTACT_2299].
xNon-compliance: The participant was non-compliant with study visits or procedures.

8.1.3 EuroQoL5dimension 5level Scale
The EQ‑5D‑5L was introduced by [CONTACT_88437] 2009.21The EQ-5D-5L consists of 
2 sections: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). 
The descriptive system comprises five dime nsions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The participant is asked 
to indicate his/her health state by [CONTACT_88438]. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level 
selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant’s health state.
The EQ VAS records the participant’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS, where the endpoints 
are labelled ‘The best imaginable health state’ and ‘The worst imaginable health state’. The 
VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of he alth outcome that reflect the participant’s own 
judgement.

Safety Assessments
8.2.1 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating ScaleThe C-SSRS will be used to assess suicide poten tial or tendency as a study entry criterion and 
monitored throughout the study.
The C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview designe d to assess the severity and intensity of 
suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour, and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour over a specified 
time period. The measurement of suicidal ideation is based on five “yes” or “no” questions 
with accompanying descriptions arranged in order of increasing severity. If the patient answers 
“yes” to either questions [ADDRESS_96571] severe 
suicidal ideation. Suicidal behaviour is assess ed by [CONTACT_88440], aborted, and interrupted attempt s; preparatory behaviour; and non-suicidal self-
injurious behaviour. 
If any item(s) on the C- SSRS are answered “yes”, the prim ary investigator or physician 
investigator must review the patient’s res ponses in order to (a) at screening and day -1
determine the patient’s study eligibility and potential need for refer ral to a mental health 
professional, and (b) during the study evaluate the patient’s need for appropriate medical 
management such as a referral to a mental health professional.
A significant risk of suicide is defined as a “yes” in answer to (a) questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal 
ideation section; or (b) any questions on any item in the suicidal behaviour section. This must 
be reported as an AE or SAE as appropria te and followed up accordingly. Additionally, if a 
patient responds “yes” to any of the suicidal ideation questions 1 through 3, the investigator 
should apply clinical judgment to determine the need for reporting this as an AE or SAE and 
the need for any a ppropriate referral.

Any AEs related to blood pressure and pulse ra te will be recorded. Investigators should not 
inform participants of any blood pressure or pulse rate changes unless clinically warranted.
All extreme high blood pressure values (systolic >160 mmHg or diastolic >110 mmHg) should 
be double-checked before the values are recorded. If blood pressure remains high, the 
Investigator should consider seeking assistance  from health care providers experienced in 
managing elevated blood pressure and refer participants with signs or symptoms of 
hypertensive crisis (eg chest pain, shortness of  breath, visual disturbance, neurological deficits,

of medications that are sensitive substrates of CYP2D6 (eg atomoxetine, desipramine,

Rescue medications may be used during and after the administration session. 
The decision to medicate a participant will depend on whether the responsible physician judges 
that they are capable of maintaining the safety  of the participant and others without medical 
intervention.

Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June 202311 ADVERSE EVENTS
Throughout the course of the study, all AEs will  be monitored and recorded in the eCRF, 
including the AE’s description, start and end date, seriousness, severity, action taken, and 
relationship to the IMP. If AEs occur, th e first concern will be the safety of the study 
participants. 
Per ICH E2A: An AE is any untoward med ical occurrence in a participant or clinical 
investigation participant administered a pharm aceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this tr eatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal la boratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a med icinal product, whether considered related 
to the medicinal product. Medical interventions such as surgeries, dia gnostic procedures, and therapeutic procedures are 
not AEs, but the action taken to treat the med ical condition. They should be recorded as 
treatment of the AEs. The investigator will promptly  notify COMPASS or ICON of all SAEs and nonserious AEs 
occurring during the clinical trial so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards 
the safety of participants and the safety of the product under clinical investigation are met. 
COMPASS or ICON has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of  a product under clinical investigation. COMPASS 
or ICON will comply with country-specific regulat ory requirements relati ng to safety reporting
to the regulatory authority, Institutional Re view Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC), and investigators. These will be detailed in the safety plan. 
Documenting Adverse Events
AEs occurring from when the participant signs the ICF until the last study event will be 
recorded. Any AEs occurring before the start of treatment (eg before the dose of the IMP on 
day 1) will be recorded as pre-treatment AEs. Also, the sign, symptom, or disease present before starting the treatment period are only cons idered AEs if they worsen after starting the 
treatment period. Investigators s hould document all significant illnes ses that the participant has 
experienced within [ADDRESS_96605] 
occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the 
study are to be documented as AEs.
All clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG results or findings should be appraised by 
[CONTACT_88453]. Isolated abnormal clinical laboratory 
test results, vital sign findings, or ECG findings (e g not part of a reported diagnosis) should be 
reported as AEs if they are sy mptomatic, lead to IMP discontinuation/study withdrawal, require 
corrective treat ment, or constitute an AE in the investigator’s clinical judgment.
At each time point, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by 
[CONTACT_88454]. AEs may be directly  observed, reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_88455]. Pa rticipants should be 
Protocol number: COMP [ADDRESS_96606] -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 61 of 88
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –[ADDRESS_96607] assess all AEs to determi ne intensity, causality and seriousness, in 
accordance with the definitions in Sections 11.2, 11.3, and 12.1, respectively. The
investigator’s assessment must be clearly docu mented in the study site’s source documentation 
with the investigator’s signature. 
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term. When a diagnosis is unavailable, report 
the primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE ter m with additional details included in the
narrative until the diagnosis becomes available. If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do 
not suggest a common diagnosis, report th em as individual entries of AE or SAE.
The investigator should report all AEs on the AE page(s) of the eCRF and source documents, 
regardless of seriousness, severity, and causality. Whenever possible, an AE will be reported 
using a diagnostic term, (eg “common cold” or “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]” rather than 
“runny nose, cough, mild fever”) and should be described with t he attributes described in 
Sections 11.2 and11.3.
Assessment of Intensity
Each AE will be classified according to the following criteria:
Mild: The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the 
participant’s normal level of functioning.
Moderate: The AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not 
hazardous to the participant’s health.
Severe: The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or 
incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the participant’s health.
Severity versus Seriousness: Severity is used to describe the level of functional impairment 
and hazardousness due to the intensity of a spe cific event while the event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"seriousness". An SAE is one that results in death, is life-threatening, causes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88406], causes significant or pers istent disability, results in a congenital 
disorder or is otherwise medically significant (see Section 12 for details).
When changes in the intensity of an AE occu r more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the experience should be noted. If the intensity category changes over several 
days, those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).
Assessment of Causality
Each AE will be assessed as to its relations hip to the IMP, based on the following criteria. 
Although the attribution by [CONTACT_88456], for analytic 
purposes a temporal association with the use of the IMP will be assumed sufficient for at least plausible association. All noxious and unintende d responses to the IM P related to the dose 
should be reported as Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR). 
Protocol number: COMP [ADDRESS_96608] -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 62 of 88
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June 2023Not related: No causal relationship exists between the IMP and the AE, but an 
obvious alternative cause exists, eg the participant’s underlying 
medical condition or concomitant therapy.
Possibly related: A connection with the administrati on of the IMP appears unlikely 
but cannot be ruled out with certai nty. An AE may be considered 
possibly related if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it 
follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from administration of the 
IMP; (2) i t could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_2299]’s 
clinical state, environmental or to xic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the part icipant; or (3) it follows a known 
pattern of response to the IMP.
Related: There is a reasonable/plausible possibility that the AE may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_2203].
When assessing the relationship to the IMP, the following criteria will be considered:
oKnown class effect
oBiological plausibility
oLack of alternative explanation —concomitant drug or disease
Action Taken Regarding Investigational Medicinal Product
Dose modifications of IMP (eg dose not changed, drug withdrawn, drug interrupted, or dose 
increased) are not applicable as this is a single dose study. 
oNot Applicable: Participant died, study treatment had been completed prior to reaction/event, or reaction/event occurred prior to start of treatment
Other Action Taken for Event
Other possible actions that can be taken for event are the following:
xNone (eg no treatment was required)
xMedication required (eg prescription and/or  OTC medication was required to treat 
the AE)
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_88407] (eg hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88408], whether medication was required)
xOther
Adverse Event Outcome
The outcome of AEs can be defined as one of the following:
Protocol number: COMP [ADDRESS_96609] -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 63 of 88
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June 2023xRecovered/Resolved (eg the participant fully recovered from the AE with no 
residual effect observed)
xRecovering/Resolving (eg the AE im proved but has not fully resolved)
xNot Recovered/Not Resolved (eg the AE itself is still present and observable)
xRecovered/Resolved with Sequelae (eg the residual effects of the AE are still 
present and observable, incl uding sequelae/residual effects)
xFatal (eg ‘fatal’ should be used when death is a direct outcome of the AE)
xUnknown
Clinical Laboratory Changes
Clinically significant abnormalities in a labor atory value that is new in onset or which has 
worsened in severity or frequency from the baseline condition and meets one of the following criteria will be recorded and reported as an AE:
oRequires therapeutic intervention or diagnostic tests
oHas accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs
oIs judged by [CONTACT_88457], either serious or nonserious, and 
whether causally related, meeting the criteria of a po tential Hy’s Law case (total bilirubin level 
≥3 × upper limit of normal [ULN] with  simultaneous ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN) should always 
be reported to the sponsor as soon as possible following the procedures outlined in Section 12.3
for SAE reporting, with the investigator’s asse ssment of seriousness, causality, and a detailed 
narrative.
Overdose
Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirme d) must be communicated to the CRO, within 
24 hours and be fully documented as an AE or SA E if it meets the SAE criteria. Details of any 
signs or symptoms and their management should be recorded including details of any antidote(s) administered.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or nonser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the study drug, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate 
notification by [CONTACT_88458]. Such AEs may require

Page 66 of 88
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June 202312 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Definition of Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:
oDeath
oLife-threatening
oInpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88409]/incapacity
oCongenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant who received 
psilocybin.
oOther: Important medical events that may not  result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], may be consider ed an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardise the participant and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Suicidal 
behaviours (which do not include non-suicid al self-injurious behaviours) must be 
classified as important medical events if  they do not otherwise meet SAE criteria.
Examples of important medical events are:
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Definition of Terms
Life-threatening: An AE is life-threatening if  the participant was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; eg  it does not include a reaction that  if it had occurred in a more 
serious form might have caused death. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved 
without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug-
induced hepatitis can be fatal.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88410]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88411] e not the result of AEs (eg elective surgery 
for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If 
anything untoward is reported du ring the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an 
AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria.
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88412] (usually involving at 
least one an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment
that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in 
doubt as to whether 'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]' occurred  or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious.
Protocol number: COMP [ADDRESS_96614] -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 67 of 88
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –[ADDRESS_96615] event that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the 
investigator assesses as related to I MP should also be reported and managed as an SAE.
The investigator should follow participants with AEs until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilised. In case of unresolved AEs, including significant abnormal clinical 
laboratory values at the end of study assessment, th ese events will be followed until resolution 
or until they become clinically not relevant.
Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitatin g or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of th e participant's ability to carry out normal life 
functions.
Reporting Serious Adverse Even ts
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness criteria ( Section 12.1).If
the AE is considered serious, the invest igator should report this event to the CRO , and to the 
IRB/IEC according to its standard operating procedures.
If the investigator detects an SAE in a study participant after the last scheduled follow -up visit, 
and considers the SAE related or possibly r elated to this study’s IMP administration, the 
investigator should report it to the CRO.
The investigator must report to the sponsor all SAEs on the eCRF page within 24 hours of
learning about the event regardless of relationship to IMP. 
All information about SAEs will be collected and reported via paper SAE form and sent by e -
mail message or facsimile (contact [CONTACT_88459]). 
The in vestigator should send the initial report within  24 h of becoming aware of the SAE. At 
minimum, the initial report should include the following information: 
oEvent and brief description of the SAE (including diagnosis or signs/symptoms)
oStudy code
oParticip ant identification number, initials, gender, and date of birth
oIMP
oReporter name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031]
• Site staff will complete th e paper SAE report form and e -mail it within 24 h to the 
following ad dress: 
• In cases wh ere the email system is unavailable, site  staff will send the SAE by [CONTACT_12100]: 
If the SAE has not resolved at the time the in vestigator submits an initial SAE report, the 
investigator must provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon receipt of

 significant information if the event is still ongoing). Additional follow-up information must be 
reported on the SAE report form and emailed  or faxed as specified above within 24 h of 
awareness following investigator (or site) awar eness of the information. The investigator 
should not delay reporting an SAE in order to obtain additional information. Additional 
information, when available, should be report ed per the reporting procedures described above. 
All SAEs shall be followed until resolution, unti l the condition stabilises, or until the participant 
is lost to follow-up, or otherwise explained. Once the SAE is resolved, the corresponding AE 
eCRF page shall be updated. Additionally, any relevant laboratory test reports, consultation 
reports from other health care professionals, discharge summaries, or other information that
has been gathered about the event may be requested by [CONTACT_88460]-up
activities.
In the case of a “minimum report” (one that solely comprises the information bulleted above), 
a more detailed follow-up report should be se nt as soon as more in formation becomes available 
but no later than 7 calendar days after the date of the initial report. Each SAE should be 
followed up until resolution or stabilisation a nd for reported deaths, the investigator should 
supply the CRO and the IRB/IEC with any addi tional requested information (eg, autopsy 
reports and terminal medical reports). 
The original SAE form should be ke pt at the study site. The sponsor or its representative will 
be responsible for determining and in turn, reporting SAEs to regulatory authorities according 
to the applicable regulatory requirements. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolved or stable and the outcome documented on the eCRF. 
Investigator safety reports will be prepared for  suspected unexpected se rious adverse reactions 
(those not listed in the IB) according to local regulatory requirements and COMPASS/the CRO
policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives an investigator sa fety report describing an SAE(s) or other 
specific safety information (eg summary or listi ng of SAEs) from COMPASS or the CRO will 
file it with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.

13.5.2 Analysis of Safety
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC ) and Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification. 
A TEAE is defined as any AE that has an onset  on or after taking study  drug, or any pre-existing
condition that has worsened on or after taking study drug.
The frequency and incidence of TEAEs will be  summarised by [CONTACT_3592]. Summaries will 
also include, but not limited to, relationship to study drug and maximum severity. The summary 
will be sorted by [CONTACT_88461] r for SOC and alphabetical order for Preferred 
Term.For each of the summaries produced at the particip ant level, multiple occurrences of the same 
event within a participant will be counted on ce in the summaries by [CONTACT_88462]; 
multiple occurrences of the same event within  a participant will be counted once in the 
maximum severity category (severe > moderate > mild) and/or maximum drug relationship 
category (reasonable possibility/no reasonable po ssibility). If severity or relationship is found 
to be missing, the most severe occurrence will be imputed for that particular summary.AESIs will also be presented using the same logic as for general AE summary tables, including 
patient incidence and event counts.These summaries will also present the number of events that occurred, so multiple occurrences 
of the same event within a pa rticipant will all be accounted for in the maximum intensity 
category and maximum relationship category they were classed as.[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram DataECG data and changes from baseline/screening  will be summarised by [CONTACT_765]. Frequency

informed that they may withdraw from the st udy at any time. They w ill receive all information 
that is required by [CONTACT_88464]. The Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a 
designated representative will provide the sponsor or its representative with a copy of the IRB 
approved ICF before the start of the study.
Exposure in Utero During Clinical Studies
Sponsor must be notified of any participant who becomes pregnant within [ADDRESS_96626] be followed to conclusion 
to determine their outcome. This information is  important for both drug safety and public health 
concerns. It is the responsibility of the inves tigator, or designee, to report any pregnancy in a 
participant or the partner of a male participant using the eCRF pregnancy within 24 h of 
becoming aware of the event. Exposure in Utero (EIU) Reporting form. Please contact [CONTACT_88465] a pregnancy. The 
investigator should make every effort to follow the participant until completion of the pregnancy and complete the EIU Reporting for m eCRF with complete pregnancy outcome 
information, including normal delivery and i nduced abortion. The adverse pregnancy outcome, 
either serious or nonserious, should be reported in accordance with study procedures. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie post-partum complications, spontaneous or induced abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including that in an aborted foetus), the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs outlined in Section 12. In the event the eCRF system is unavailable, a back-up 
paper Pregnancy Reporting Form will be availa ble for site staff to complete following the 
reporting guidelines as outlined in Section 12.2.
For reports of pregnancy in the partner of a male participant within 30 days from receiving the IMP, the pregnancy eCRF page EIU form (or SAE form if associated with an adverse outcome) 
should be completed with the participant’s initials, and date of birth, and details regarding the 
partner of the male participant should be  entered in the narrative section.

notified within five days.
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written 
amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC a nd the investigator must await approval before 
implementing the changes. COMPASS will su bmit protocol amendments to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities for approval. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the invest igator, and/or COMPASS the amendment to the 
protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the 
participant and/or has an impact on the par ticipant's involvement as a study participant, the 
currently approved written ICF will require similar modification. In such cases, informed 
consent will be renewed for participants enro lled in the study before continued participation.

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI
Ethical Principles
for
Medical Research Involving Human Participants
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly
Helsinki, Finland, June [ADDRESS_96642] the health of the people. The physician’s 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.
Protocol number: COMP [ADDRESS_96643] -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 85 of 88
 
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –09 June 2023
 The Declaration of Geneva of the World Me dical Association binds the physician with the 
words, "The health of my partic ipant will be my first consid eration," and the International Code 
of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the participant's interest when 
providing medical care which might have the ef fect of weakening the physical and mental 
condition of the participant."
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human participants.
In medical research on human participants, co nsiderations related to the well-being of the 
human participant should take precedence over the interests of science and society.
The primary purpose of medical research involvi ng human participants is to improve 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedur es and the understanding of the aetiology and 
pathogenesis of disease. Even the best-prove n prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic 
methods must continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, 
accessibility and quality.In current medical practice and in medical re search, most prophylactic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.
Medical research is participant to ethical sta ndards that promote respect for all human beings 
and protect their health and rights. Some research  populations are vulnerable and need special 
protection. The particular needs of the economicall y and medically disadvantaged must be 
recognised. Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent for 
themselves, for those who may be participan t to giving consent under duress, for those who 
will not benefit personally from the research a nd for those for whom the research is combined 
with care.
Research investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for 
research on human participants in their own countries as well as applicable international 
requirements. No national ethical, legal or regulat ory requirement should be allowed to reduce 
or eliminate any of the protections for human  participants set forth in this Declaration.
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCHIt is the duty of the physician in medical research  to protect the life, health, privacy, and dignity 
of the human participant.
Medical research involving human participants mu st conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources 
of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation.
Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research, which may affect the 
environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected.
The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human participants should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a specially 
Protocol number: COMP [ADDRESS_96644] -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 86 of 88
 
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –[ADDRESS_96645] the privacy of the participant, the confidentiality of the 
participant’s information and to minimise the im pact of the study on the participant's physical 
and mental integrity and on the personality of the participant.
In any research on human beings, each potential participant must be ad equately informed of 
the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possi ble conflicts of interest, institutional 
affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated bene fits and potential risks of the study and the 
discomfort it may entail. The participant should be informed of the right to abstain from 
participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. 
After ensuring that the participant has underst ood the information, the physician should then 
obtain the participant's freely-given informed co nsent, preferably in writing. If the consent

Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –[ADDRESS_96647] obtain that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorised representative.Research on individuals from whom it is no t possible to obtain cons ent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if th e physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons 
for involving research participants with a cond ition that renders them unable to give informed 
consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the 
review committee. The protocol should state that consent to remain in th e research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorised surrogate.Both authors and publishers have ethical oblig ations. In publication of the results of research, 
the investigators are obliged to preserve the accur acy of the results. Negative as well as positive 
results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional 
affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should 
not be accepted for publication.
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE
The physician may combine medical research wi th medical care, only to the extent that the 
research is justified by [CONTACT_54233],  diagnostic or therapeutic value. When medical 
research is combined with medical care, addition al standards apply to protect the participants 
who are research participants.The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those 
of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the 
use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies  where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or 
therapeutic method exists.
Protocol number: COMP [ADDRESS_96648] -traumatic Stress DisorderConfidential
Page 88 of 88
 
Version 5.0 ([LOCATION_003]) –[ADDRESS_96649] be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic 
measures, if in the physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or 
alleviating suffering. Where possible, these mea sures should be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate their safety and efficac y. In all cases, new information should be recorded 
and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

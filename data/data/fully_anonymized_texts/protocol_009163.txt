1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1. Synopsis
Title: Accuracyand precision of peripheral capi[INVESTIGATOR_493832]-oximetry in neonates.
Study Description: Pulse oximetry helps in measuring peripheral capi[INVESTIGATOR_493833] (SpO 2) continuously and non- invasively, and provides an 
indirect measurement of arterial oxygenation (SaO 2) based on the 
red and infrared light- absorption characteristics of oxygenated and 
deoxygenated hemoglobin. Uses of pulse oximetry include
detection of hypoxia, avoidance of hyperoxia, titration of fractional 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401], and enabling weaning from mechanical 
ventilation. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, such as by [CONTACT_493851]-oximeter, provides a direct measurement of SaO 2. However, 
ABG analysis requires time, expense, and arterial access. 
Therefore, this study aims to validate the SpO 2accuracy of pulse 
oximetry sensors (manufactured by [CONTACT_493852], and 
reprocessed by [CONTACT_488729], LP) in neonates as compared to
ABGmeasurements as part of their clinical standard of care(SOC),
as assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_609]-oximetry. 
Objective: To validate the SpO 2accuracy, bias, and precisionreprocessed pulse oximetry sensors as compared to SaO 2in arterial 
blood samples as assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_609]-oximetry in neonates.
Endpoint: Pulse oximeter and co-oximeter reading pair used to determine the 
accuracy of each pulse oximeter by [CONTACT_493853] (A RMS), bias, and precision .

2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. Background & Rationale
Pulse oximetry helps in measuring SpO 2continuously and non-invasively, and also 
provides an indirect measurement of SaO 2based on the red and infrared light-absorption 
characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The ABG analysis, such as 
by [CONTACT_493854]-oximeter, provides a direct measurement of SaO 2.1,2However, ABG 
analysis requires time, expense, and arterial puncture; therefore non-invasive techniques
that give similar results are being investigated.
This study aims to validate the SpO 2accuracy and precision of pulse oximetry sensors 
(manufactured by [CONTACT_493852], and reprocessed by [CONTACT_488729], LP) in 
neonates as compared to ABGmeasurements as part oftheir clinical SOC,as assessed by 
[INVESTIGATOR_609]-oximetry. 
2.2. StudyProducts
2.2.1.MedlineSensors, Neo (2329)
The Masimo sensors are indicated for monitoring SpO 2and pulse rate for use with 
neonatal patients in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-type facilities, mobile, and home environments. 
Further information on these sensors can be found in Appendix 11.1.1.
2.2.2. MedlineN
The Nellcor sensors are used for monitoring SpO 2and pulse rate on neonates. Further 
information on the products can be found in Appendix 11.1.2.
2.3. Risk/Benefit Profile
2.3.1. Potential Study Risks
Masimo and Nellcor sensors are contraindicated for use on patients who exhibit allergic 
reactions to foam rubber products and/or adhesive tape. While we are screening to not 
include subjectswithdermatological issues, some subjects with unidentified issues may be 
enrolled. Subjects will be under the care of a physician who will be able to appropriately 
address any potential reaction from these products. Although protective measures are taken 
by [CONTACT_493855], there is a risk of potential disclosure of Protected Health 
Information (PHI)by [CONTACT_493856]. 
Medline Industries, LP
Accuracy of SpO [ADDRESS_635408] benefits to the neonates enrolled in this study or to their families. The 
societal benefit is knowing if the reprocessed sensors are accurate and precise.
2.3.3. Assessment of Potential Risk/Benefit Profile
The use of these products presents minimal risk for subjects enrolled in this study, while 
offering the potential for societal benefit. Therefore, the risk-benefit profile for the study 
is favorable.

7 ADVERSE DEVICE EVENTS 
7.1 Definition of Adverse Device Event(ADE)
The ADE is the adverse event (AE) related to the use of an investigational medical device 
resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the IFU, the deployment, installation, the 
operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device or from error use.
7.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Device Event (SADE)
The SADE is the adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event (SAE).
The FDA definition of SAEwill be used in this study: An AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered seriousif, in theview of either the PI[INVESTIGATOR_10157], it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
Death
A life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions or,
A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. All SADEs will be reported 
to Medline, regardless of potential relationship to the investigational device. SADEs will be 
reported to the reviewing IRB as necessary according to their rules. 
7.[ADDRESS_635416](UADE)
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified 
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including 
a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
7.4 Severity of Adverse Device Event
Mild (1 = Grade 1): Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of 
minor irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms would 
not require medication or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.

V 3.0  Page 17 
Moderate (2 = Grade 2): Discomfort severe enough to cause interference with usual 
activities; requiring treatment but not extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493839].
Severe (3 = Grade 3): Incapacitating with inability to do work or usual activities; 
signs and symptoms may be systemic in nature or require medical evaluation and/or 
treatment; requiring additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_356993] (prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).Life-threatening (4 = Grade 4 ): At immediate risk of death in view of the 
investigator, or it is suspected that the use or continued use of the product would 
result in subject
Death (5 = Grade 5): Death related to adverse event.
7.5 Relatedness of ADEand SADE
Unrelated: This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc.)
Possible: This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the Investigational 
Product administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.
Probable: This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to 
be related to the Investigational Product.
Definite: This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to the Investigational Product.
7.6Expectedness
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_493840]. An ADE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the medical device. 
Expected ADEs include a reaction or irritation at the study site following application of the 
sensors or the site from where blood is drawn.
7.7Adverse Device Event Reporting
The ADEs will be recorded on the Adverse Event form, provided by [CONTACT_488729], LP,
by [CONTACT_7880]. Changes in the severity of an ADE will be documented to allow an assessment 
of the duration of the event at each level of severity. Changes in severity will necessitate a new 
CRF to document the new level of severity. ADEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination 
Data from a study assessing the accuracy of both pulse oximeters on an adult population (Study 
ID # 2018-268) were used as parameters for sample size estimation for this protocol. Sample 
size estimation was conducted separately for each product using both the Confidence Intervals 
for One Standard Deviation Using Standard Deviation (as an estimate for the accuracy root 
mean squarestatistic in equation 1.1 below) and Bland-Altman procedures in PASS 
2020 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (2020). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003], 
ncss.com/software/pass. The most conservative estimate between the two products for the 
sample size (18) and the Bland-Altman statistic (40) was used as the minimum number 
of data pairs, n.A data pair will consist of a pulse oximeter sensor reading paired with an ABG 
reading collected by a CO-oximeter. We selected a sample size of at least [ADDRESS_635418] sensors, for a minimum of 27 subjects. The same blood gas value can be used for 
multiple sensors applied simultaneously.
8.2 Randomization 
Randomization will not be completed as the data are collected from a convenience sample of 
subjects.
8.3. Populations for Analysis
All data pairs will be included for analysis, unless at the time of data acquisition any one or 
more of the following is trueOR (3) the heart rate measurement derived from the pulse oximeter is 0 beats per minute; OR 
(4) the research personnel collecting the data notes an anomaly in the measurement on the CRF 
at the time of data collection before data analysis begins. Any such designated outliers and/or 
anomalous data will be explained and any data that is excluded from the analysis will be 
justified in the final report. 
8.4Data Analysis
Accuracy of each pulse oximeter will be assessed per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2017, the FDAOximeters - Premarket Notification Submissions [510(k)s] Guidance for Industry and Food 
paper by [CONTACT_493860].,

V 3.0  Page 21 
For each pulse oximeter, a Bland-Altman plot (mean vs. difference of SaO 2and SpO 2) and an error 
plot (SaO 2vs. difference of SaO 2and SpO 2) will be generated. Between and within subject 
variance and upper and lower 95% limits of agreement will be presented. Subject demographic 
datawill be presented with summary statisticsand site-level effects will be assessed as appropriate.
Outliers will be explained and any data that is excluded from the data analysis or any deviations 
from this statistical analysis plan will be justified in the final report.
9 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1 Clinical Monitoring
The Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will confirm that the rights and well-being of 
subjects are protected, and that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable 
from source documents. Moreover, the CRA will confirm the conduct of the trial by [CONTACT_978], 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461], and sites are in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and regulatory 
requirements as well as any applicable institution or IRB and federal or local processes. 
Monitoring will occur every two months, depending on the enrollment during the study 
duration. It will occur more frequently if: The volume or quantity of data is large or there is a backlog of review due to 
unexpected issues
This would also include any large volume of CRFs to be reviewed 
The site compliance with the protocol or compliance with expected ICH/GCP 
and regulatory requirements is lacking or there are continuing unresolved 
compliance issuesThere are unexpected AE/SAE or subject safety concerns noted 
There are any unexpected inconsistencies with study product management
There is a request for more frequent monitoring by [CONTACT_493861] a longer interval based off of 
enrollment. CRA will discuss this with Medline Director or Clinical Manager and will 
inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_401947]. 
Monitoring activities will include subject eligibility, source data review, CRF completion 
verification, product accountability, site continued suitability, PI [INVESTIGATOR_493841], 
compliance, and all general monitoring activities as outlined in FDAs Code of Federal 
Regulations and ICH/GCP guidelines that guide that activity.  
Medline Industries LP may, on occasion, contract with external Clinical Research 
Organizations to provide CRA services and those CRAs are authorized to act on behalf of 
Medline Industries, LP.
Medline Industries, LP
Accuracy of SpO [ADDRESS_635419] Operating 
Procedures during the execution of the protocol and evidence of that compliance should be 
readily documented and verifiable by [CONTACT_2689]. 
The CRA will generate an internal Medline Industries, LPvisit report that will be filed with 
the Medline Industries, LPtrial master file and will provide the PI a detailed follow-up letter

adhesive sensorsareindicatedforsingle patient usefor continuous noninvasive 
monitoring of functional oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin (SpO 2) and pulse rate
(measured by [CONTACT_493868] 2 sensor) forusewith adult, pediatric, infant, and neonatalpatients
during no motion conditions, and forpatientswhoarewellperfused in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-
type facilities, mobile, and home environments (see Table 1).  
Consult Instructions for Use
Do not re-use. Single patient use only
Non-sterile
Not made with natural rubber latex

18October2018    Page 3 of 9     Redmond, OR [ZIP_CODE]
If using pulse oximetry during full body irradiation, keep the sensor out of the 
radiation field. If sensor is exposed to the radiation, the reading might be inaccurate 
or the unit might read zero for the duration of the active radiation period. 
Do not use the sensor during MRI scanning or in a MRI environment. 
High ambient light sources such as surgical lights (especially those with a xenon light 
source), bilirubin lamps, fluorescent lights, infrared heating lamps, and direct sunlight 
can interfere with the performance of the sensor.To prevent interference from ambient light, ensure that the sensor is properly applied, 
and cover the sensor site with opaque material, if required. Failure to take this 
precaution in high ambient light conditions may result in inaccurate measurements. High levels of COHb or MetHb may occur with a seemingly normal SpO 2. When 
elevated levels of COHb or MetHb are suspected, laboratory analysis (CO-Oximetry) 
of a blood sample should be performed. 
Elevated levels of Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) may lead to inaccurate SpO 2
measurements.
Elevated levels of Methemoglobin (MetHb) will lead to inaccurate SpO [ADDRESS_635424] 
performance and/or accuracy.
Do not attempt to reuse on multiple patients, reprocess, recondition or recycle sensors 
or Masimo patient cables as these processes may damage the electrical components, 
potentially leading to patient harm. 
High oxygen concentrations may predispose a premature infant to retinopathy. 
Therefore, the upper alarm limit for the oxygen saturation must be carefully selected 
in accordance with accepted clinical standards.Caution: Replace the sensor when a replace sensor message is displayed, or when a 
low SIQ message is consistently displayed after completing the low SIQ 
troubleshooting steps identified in the monitoring device operator’s manual. 
Note: The sensor is provided with X-Cal™ technology to minimize the risk of 
inaccurate readings and unanticipated loss of patient monitoring. The sensor will 
provide up to [ADDRESS_635425] 
sensor.

the sensor site may be too thick, thin, or deeply pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], or otherwise deeply colored 
(for example, as a result of externally applied coloring such as nail polish, dye, or 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_493849]) to permit appropriate light transmission. If any of these situations 
occurs, reposition the sensor or choose an alternate Nellcor sensor for use on a different 
site.
Model MAXI
1. Remove plastic backing from the MAXI and locate transparent windows (b) on 
the adhesive side. Windows cover optical components. Note corresponding 
alignment marks (a) on the non-adhesive side and dashedline (c)midwaybetween

A5481159, NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOLProtocol Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_1128826] cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women and the second leading cause of
cancer deaths. Currently, the average risk of a woman in the [LOCATION_002] (US) developi[INVESTIGATOR_815257] 13% with 276,480 new cases of invasive BC and 42,170 deaths from BC expected this year in the US. At this time there are more than3.5 million women living with a history of BC in the US including women who are still being treated ( Miller et al, 2016 ).
21In the US, women under the age of 50 years-old comprise 
20% of all BC diagnoses ( Siegel et al, 2017 ; DeSantis et al, 2017 )29,8and young women with 
hormone receptor-positive (HR+) disease are seeing an annual increase of over 8% yearly from 1992-2009 ( Shah et al, 2020 ).
28In 2017, it was estimated that 154,794 women in the 
US were living with metastatic BC (MBC); of these 3 out of 4 progressed from an early stage BC ( Mariotto et al, 2017 ).
19MBC remains an incurable disease with 5-year survival rates of 
27% ( American Cancer Society Facts and Figures, 2020 )1with young women presenting
with more aggressive disease than those who are postmenopausal ( Shah et al, 2020 ).28
HR+ BC is the most commonly diagnosed subtype (approximately 70-80%) ( Kumler et al, 
2016 ).16The goal of treatment for MBC is to prolong the time to disease progression or 
extend life to the extent possible or improve/maintain quality of life of that survival ( Tanguy 
et al, 2018 ).31
Palbociclib, an oral CDK4/6 inhibitor, is approved for HR+/HER2– advanced or MBC in 
combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or fulvestrant. Palbociclib was approved in the US based on improved median progression-free survival (PFS) demonstrated in 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_40798]: PALOMA-1 and PALOMA-2 (initial endocrine-based therapy in combination with letrozole for advanced disease) and PALOMA-3 (in combination with fulvestrant after progression on or after prior endocrine therapy). An accelerated approval was first granted based on results from the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 trial ( Finn et al, 2015 )
11in February 2015.
The median PFS in the palbociclib and letrozole arm was 20.2 months versus 10.2 months in the letrozole only arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.488, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.319, 0.748; 1-sided p=0.0004).
Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant was approved 1 year later (February 2016) in pre 
or postmenopausal women with disease progression following endocrine therapy based on results from the PALOMA-3 trial ( Turner et al, 2015 ;Cristofanilli et al, 2016 )
33,6which 
showed a statistically significant improvement in the median PFS for the palbociclib + fulvestrant arm compared with placebo + fulvestrant arm (11.2 versus 4.6 months,respectively; HR = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.62; p<0.001]). Final overall survival (OS) data from that study has been reported ( Turner et al, 2018 )
34demonstrating median OS of 
34.9 months versus 28 months in the palbociclib + fulvestrant arm versus the placebo + fulvestrant arm (HR = 0.81; 95% CI; 0.64, 1.03; 1-sided p=0.0249), which was not statistically significant.

Page 8 of 49The Phase 3 PALOMA-2 study confirmed the findings from the PALOMA-1 trial, 
demonstrating a median PFS in the palbociclib + letrozole arm of 24.8 months compared to 14.5 months in the placebo + letrozole arm (HR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.72; 1-sided p<0.001) (Finn et al, 2016 ).
12Subgroup PFS analyses according to stratification factors and 
demographic characteristics or prognostic factors revealed consistent results in PALOMA-2 (Finn et al, 2016 )
12and PALOMA-3 trials ( Turner et al, 2015 ;Cristofanilli et al, 2016 )33,6in 
all subgroups. The objective response rate (ORR) from PALOMA-2 was 42.1% (95% CI:37.5, 46.9) in the palbociclib group versus 34.7% (95% CI: 28.4, 41.3) in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR]=1.40 [95% CI: 0.98, 2.01], p=0.06). Of note, pre/perimenopausal women were not included in the PALOMA-1 or -2 trials investigating palbociclib + letrozole as first-line treatment for women with ER+/HER2- advanced disease. The PALOMA-3 study investigating palbociclib + fulvestrant didinclude pre or perimenopausal women, and the 
study evaluated patients who were considered endocrine resistant. The subgroup of 108/521(21%) pre or perimenopausal women randomized to palbociclib + fulvestrant + goserelin versus placebo + fulvestrant + goserelin showed a statistically longer median PFS of 9.5 months versus 5.6 months, respectively (HR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.87) ( Figure 1 )
(Loibl et al, 2017 ).
17The ORR in this subgroup was 25% versus 11% (OR: 3.06; 95% CI: 
0.82, 13.38) and the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 69.4% and 44.4% (OR: 2.89; 95% CI: 1.15, 7.34), respectively ( Loibl et al, 2017 ).
17The safety profile from the PALOMA-2 
and -3 trials were consistent, with no new safety signals identified across the Phase 3 studies.Long-term pooled safety analyses of the 3 randomized Phase 2 and 3 studies demonstrated no evidence of specific cumulative or delayed toxicities with palbociclib + endocrine therapy(Dieras et al, 2018 ; Finn et al, 2019 ).
9,13The most frequently reported adverse event (AE) of 
palbociclib was neutropenia, which could be managed with dosing interruption and/or dose reduction.

Furthermore, in the MONALEESA 7 randomized 
controlled trial (RCT), ribociclib, another approved CDK 4/6 inhibitor, in combination with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) demonstrated a significant median PFS benefit (23.8 versus 13.0 months; HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.69; p<0.0001) in patients treated with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy (ET) versus ET alone ( Tripathy et al, 2018 ).
32Similar 
results were demonstrated in the NSAI combination subgroup excluding tamoxifen patients (27.5 versus 13.8 months and HR = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.44, 0.74]; n = 495). OS benefit in the pre or perimenopausal patient population treated with ribociclib + NSAI was also statistically significant, with median OS of not estimable (NE) versus 42 months in the AI subgroup population (HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.98) ( Im et al, 2019 ).
15The recently published FDA
pooled analysis of CDK 4/6 inhibitor treatment for patients with HR+/HER2– advanced or MBC, reported for patients aged 40 years and under who were treated with a CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1128827]-line, showed an HR = 0.50 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.74)

exemestane (and leuprolide) (n=92) versus capecitabine (n=86) in premenopausal women with advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2– BC with a primary endpoint of PFS. Median PFS in the palbociclib combination arm was 20.1 months versus 14.4 months in the capecitabine arm (95% CI: 14.2, 21.8) with HR = 0.659 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.10); 1-sided p=0.024. There was an ORR of 37% (34/92 patients) in the palbociclib group and 34% (29/86 patients) in the capecitabine group which achieved an objective response (p=0.781). The CBR differed between the groups, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (80.4% versus 69.9%, p=0.105) ( Park et al, 2019 ).

Page 11 of 49Real world (rw) assessment has also been shown to be feasible and meaningful. Analysis of 
data for patients with MBC has been conducted to show that clinically meaningful information can be derived from the assessment of real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world tumor response (rwTR) based on electronic health record (EHR) data abstraction when proper quality controls and analytic methods are incorporated based on concordance shown between RCTs and rw data. Concordance of rwPFS and real world tumor response (rwTR) from the US EHR with RCT data in MBC was recently demonstrated in a retrospective analysis comparing the PALOMA-2 trial letrozole + placebo control arm population cohort with a corresponding real-world cohort of US MBC patients treated with letrozole alone indicating the potential for real-world data to provide clinically consistent outcomes information ( Bartlett et al, 2020 ).
3  
Real-world effectiveness for palbociclib combination therapy has been reported through 
retrospective analysis; however, follow-up has been limited. In a single-arm retrospective chart review, the palbociclib + AI treatment, landmark analyses showed that 84.1% of patients were progression-free and 95.1% were alive at 12 months with an ORR of 79.5% ( Taylor-Stokes et al, 2019
30Real world effectiveness of palbociclib + letrozole versus 
letrozole alone on rwPFS and OS was evaluated as an exploratory objective in a HR+/HER2–US MBC population (pre and postmenopausal patients) ( DeMichele et al, 2019 ).
7This study 
analysis suggests an associated rwPFS and OS benefit for palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone in 772 patients and 658 patients, respectively (464 in each propensity score matched group). The HR for PFS was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.65; p<0.0001)and HR for OS was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.73; p<0.0001) in the propensity score matched population. Tumor response was not reported in this analysis. In the subgroup of younger patients (patients aged 18-50 years), a benefit in OS was seen in patients treated with palbociclib + letrozole versus letrozole alone with a HR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.13, 1.20);however, the sample sizes, (n=37 and n= 31, respectively) were limited. Another analysis ofthe EHR database assessed comparative real-world tumor response (rwTR) in a cohort of HR+/HER2– MBC patients receiving palbociclib + letrozole versus letrozole alone who had at least 1 tumor assessment postbaseline. rwTR was assessed using the treating physicians’ clinical assessment of changes in disease burden based on radiologic scans. In 430 propensity score matched patients (215 in each group), patients were more likely to respond to first-line palbociclib + letrozole than letrozole alone after propensity score matching (PSM) with a real-world best tumor response (defined as patients with a complete response or partial response) of 58.6% versus 39.1%, respectively; OR = 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5, 3.2), p<0.0001). In the same PSM-matched patients, a consistent benefit was demonstrated in additional effectiveness endpoints in the palbociclib combination arm with respect to PFS with a HR = 0.60 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.79), p=0.0002) and OS with a HR = 0.58 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.85;
p=0.0052) (Brusfky et al, 2020 ).

The study described in this protocol will evaluate data for all patients initiating palbociclib + 
AI or AI alone within the US Oncology Network (USON) who meet the entry criteria and initiated palbociclib combination therapy between 01 January 2010 and 30 June 2020. Data will be sourced from the USON’s iKM EHR.
The current protocol is not designed as a Post Authorization Safety Study (PASS) and the
study is not a commitment or requirement to any regulatory authority.
8. RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
This study aims to assess real-world tumor response in pre/perimenopausal HR+/HER2–
MBC patients initiating palbociclib + AI or AI alone as first-line therapy during the period on or after 01 January 2010 to on or before 30 June 2020. Data will be obtained from structured data fields within the iKM EHR database and will be supplemented by [CONTACT_815274] a targeted chart review.
Primary Objective
•To estimate the rwRR for pre/perimenopausal patients treated with palbociclib + AI 
compared to AI alone as first-line therapy for HR+/HER2– MBC.

originate from 1 of 2 sources: the iKM EHR database (structured data) or chart review (unstructured data), although some variables may be derived from these raw data sources (eg, age from date of birth). Derived and transformed data needed for the analysis are described and presented along with the operational definitions in Table [ADDRESS_1128833] been found to be more reliably and comprehensively captured through chart review of unstructured fields. Other variables require information that can only be sourced through chart review (eg, response and progression). 
Variables described as being captured at “baseline” will be captured at the date closest to the 
index date initiation within 90 days prior. Variables described as being captured with “prior medical history” will be sourced from patients’ entire medical history within the USON prior to index treatment initiation. If multiple values are available during the time period of measurement, either baseline or prior medical history, the one closest (in absolute value) to treatment initiation will be used.
Some data elements will be captured from both iKM and chart review. Since the chart review 
data are expected to provide a richer source of information, if data are available from both sources for a single patient, then chart review data will supersede what is available in the structured iKM data for the final analysis.
As this study is expected to obtain an exception and waiver of informed consent from The 
US Oncology Institutional Review Board, a deidentified dataset will be used for analysis. To comply with applicable data regulations and to reduce the risk of patient reidentification, the deidentified dataset will be certified through an expert determination process before it is transferred to [COMPANY_007]. This expert determination will be performed by [CONTACT_815275]. During the process, this individual will confirm which data elements can be transferred in the deidentified dataset. Some of the variables anticipated in the protocol may also need to be modified based on guidance received during expert determination, including the granularity of dates, race categories, and geographic location.

prior to indexThe duration of time, in weeks, between the date of BC 
diagnosis and presentation of metastatic disease. 
To assess BC diagnoses that occurred prior to index, patients’ available medical history in iKM will searched. The completeness of this history will vary 
based on the length of disease and the time within the 
USON. Records may also be incomplete for patients with an initial BC diagnosis that occurred outside of the USON.
Diagnosis of BC will be determined through a review 
of iKM’s discrete diagnosis and histology fields, which are populated during the routine course of care (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] codes will not be used).
If no initial diagnosis date is documented, the first 
recorded diagnosis date in iKM will be used. This date will be used in calculations, not reported separately.

Two approaches will be used to capture comorbidities 
documented in patients’ medical records. First, 
comorbidities explicitly documented by [CONTACT_815278]. Separately, patients with suspected comorbidities based on receipt of medications associated with those conditions will be 
identified. 
To identify suspected comorbidities, an extract of all 
concomitant meds documented pre-index for the study 
population cohorts will be generated with patients’ 
entire treatment history documented in the structured data. The study team, including clinical experts and the Physician Investigator, will review the frequency 
distributions of the medications and map these to 
chronic conditions.  
For analysis purposes, comorbidities explicitly 
documented by [CONTACT_815279].

observation 
periodIn prospective clinical trials, response is generally 
assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria In

Instead, for this study, provider documented 
assessments of tumor response will be used. No attempts will be made to mimic the RECIST guidelines.Response assessments documented for the index treatment (depending on cohort). It is possible that

documented if a scan report was documented as the 
basis of the assessment.Tumor assessments will be classified as:
Complete response: Documented as “a complete 
response” to therapy; indication patient is in 
“remission”; “all lesions” have disappeared or “no evidence of disease”).Partial response: Documented as partial reduction 
in size of visible disease in some or all areas 
without any areas of increase in visible disease (decrease in disease volume even though disease is still present).
Stable disease : Documented as disease is stable 
(not progressed or not improved; eg Stable appearance of lobe nodules and Mixed response: Combination of improved and worsened disease.

Table [ADDRESS_1128834] study data will originate from the EHR system of the USON, iKM. 
The USON includes 1,200 affiliated physicians operating in over 470 sites of care in the US and treats approximately 1 million US cancer patients annually (https://www.usoncology.com/our -company). i KM captures outpatient practice encounter 
histories for patients under community-based care, including, but not limited to patient demographics such as age and gender; clinical information such as disease diagnosis, diagnosis stages, performance status information and laboratory testing results; and treatment information, such as dosages and treatment administration within the USON. 
Structured data fields within the iKM EHR database will provide information needed to 
address most research questions. These data will be supplemented by [CONTACT_815282] (methodology described in Section 9.6 ). Electronic chart 
review data will be collected by [CONTACT_3553] a secure, web-based electronic case report form (eCRF) by [CONTACT_815283]. 
The study will only use data from USON practices utilizing full EHR capacities of iKM. 
Data management and administrative processing is supported by [CONTACT_15943]’s quality assurance procedures. Additionally, iKM has previously been used to evaluate patient profiles, treatment patterns and outcomes among MBC patients and the results have been consistent with other published studies. ( Patt et al, 2015 , Patt et al, 2016 , Robert et al,
2015 ).

The Limited Access Death Master File (LADMF) of the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) 
and the National Death Index (NDI) of the Centers for Disease Control will be additional sources of vital status (death), in addition to death dates recorded in the EHR. Common patient identifiers (patient identification, name, and birth date) will be used to link patients from the iKM data warehouse and iKM chart review. Patients’ names, dates of birth and social security numbers (SSN) will be used to link patients from iKM, LADMF and NDI data sources. All patients within iKM are assigned a unique patient identifier by [CONTACT_815284] (eg, some large practices have separate installations by [CONTACT_157478]). When linking to the LADMF, patient SSN is used. Some practices do not collect SSN and some patients may not report it.

Once received by [CONTACT_293423], data validation will continue and will consist of, but is not limited to, quality control checks for appropriate values, logical sequences and quantity of missing values. 
A list of patients eligible for chart review will be generated by [CONTACT_815286]. This list of patients will then be securely transmitted to the Chart Review Team Manager. 
The McKesson study team will lead a training session with chart abstractors to discuss study 
specific considerations. Reference materials will also be provided to abstractors at this time. If chart abstractors have questions during the abstraction process, these will first be raised to the Chart Review Team Manager. If needed, questions can be escalated to the Outcomes Researcher and Principal Investigator. 
Chart review will be accomplished by [CONTACT_2363] a secure, web-based eCRF. The main purpose 
of the eCRF is to obtain data required by [CONTACT_381219]-interventional study protocol in a complete, accurate, legible and in a timely manner.

Page 30 of 499.6.1. Case Report Forms (CRFs)/Data Collection Tools (DCTs)/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient. The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007]. McKesson shall ensure that the CRFs are securely stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by [CONTACT_20011].
McKesson has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, 
and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_593892]. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.
The source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54602]'s chart. In these cases, data collected 
on the CRFs must match those charts. 
9.6.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], 
McKesson agrees to keep all study-related records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source documents, detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained by [CONTACT_815287], whichever is longer. McKesson must ensure that the records continue to be stored securely for so long as they are retained.
If McKesson becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period, [COMPANY_007] should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007].
Study records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1128840] be retained for longer than 15 years if required by [CONTACT_13762].

retention requirements have been met.
9.7. Data Analysis
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
are outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by [CONTACT_456]. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.7.1. Statistical Hypotheses
The primary purpose of this study is to estimate real world tumor response for 
pre/peri-menopausal patients treated with palbociclib + AI or AI alone as first line treatment for HR+/HER2- MBC in the US clinical practice setting. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed.
9.7.2. Sample Size Determination
Approximately 385 patients will be included with close to a 1:2 ratio between palbociclib + 
AI and AI alone cohorts based on examination of structured iKM data applying inclusion/exclusion criteria ( Table 2 andTable 3 ) between 01 January 2010 and 30 June 
2020. It is estimated that there will be approximately 135 patients in the palbociclib + AI armand [ADDRESS_1128842]-baseline tumor assessment.  
9.7.3. Cohort for Analysis
All effectiveness analyses will be based on the pre/perimenopausal cohort. Eligible 
pre/perimenopausal patients with HR+/HER2- MBC will be included into the following cohorts:
Cohort to be analyzed for the primary objective:
a. Pre/perimenopausal patients treated with palbociclib + an AI as the initial therapy for 
the treatment of MBC.
b. Pre/perimenopausal patients treated with an AI alone as the initial therapy for the 
treatment of MBC.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) 
Propensity score matching (PSM) will be used to create matched sets of palbociclib treated 
and untreated patients who shared similar value of the propensity score. The propensity scores produce a set of matched pairs with similar distributions of the covariates but does not require close or exact matches for each individual matched pair of patients. Once the matched sample has been formed, the treatment effect can be estimated by [CONTACT_815288] (IBRANCE®)
A5481159, NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOLProtocol Version 1.0, 21 December 2020
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 32 of 49comparing outcomes between palbociclib treated and untreated patients in the matched 
sample. Variables to be used in the estimation of propensity scores (PS) may include key baseline demographics (ie, age, race) and clinical characteristics (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance score, disease stage at initial diagnosis, visceral metastasis, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and number of disease sites). A final list will be specified in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analyses of Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is real-world response rate (rwRR) and the rwRR will be calculated as 
the proportion of patients with a real-world complete response (CR) or real-world partial response (PR) by [CONTACT_14338]. Patients with a best response of CR or PR are those patients with a CR or PR after 30 days of treatment initiation without a PD at any prior assessment.
Real-world tumor responses (rwTR) are assessed based on treating clinician’s assessment of 
radiological evidence for change in burden of disease over the course of treatment.Assessments were not performed on a schedule and responses were not confirmed by [CONTACT_815289]. Each assessment will be classified as follows:
•Complete response (CR): Documented as “a complete response” to therapy; 
indication patient is in “remission”; “all lesions” have disappeared or “no evidence of disease”).
•Partial response (PR): Documented as partial reduction in size of visible disease in 
some or all areas without any areas of increase in visible disease (decrease in disease volume even though disease is still present).
•Stable disease (SD): Documented as disease is stable (not progressed or not 
improved; eg, stable appearance of lobe nodules) or Mixed response, which is a combination of improved and worsened disease.
•Progressive disease (PD): Documented as disease has “progressed”; or worsening of 
disease.
•Not evaluated (NE): No documentation of status of disease.
To overcome the potential imbalance of baseline characteristics between the 2 cohorts, the 
propensity score (PS) will be computed by a logistic regression model using baseline characteristics for each patient. The PSM technique will be used to control for potentialconfounding factors when comparing the cohorts. Each patient in the palbociclib + AI cohort will be matched (1:1) to a patient in the AI alone cohort using a greedy matching algorithm, which sequentially without replacement selects the control patient whose propensity score is closest to that of the particular patient in the palbociclib + AI cohort. This matching processwill be performed independently and prior to the access of rwTR outcome data.

Page 33 of 49The analysis of the primary endpoint is to estimate the rwRR between the 2 cohorts 
(palbociclib + AI compared to AI alone) using PSM method to balance baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between the two real world treatment cohorts. 
The number and percentage of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, SD, PD, and 
NE will be tabulated. The number and proportion of patients achieving rwTR (CR or PR) will be summarized along with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% confidence interval calculated using a method based on Clopper-Pearson method. The odds ratio and the corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence interval will be calculated to contrast the treatment effectiveness on response rates. 
Two analyses of rwRR will be performed: 
1. rwRR among those patients who had at least one post-baseline tumor assessment 
documented in the database. 
2. rwRR among all eligible patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria as 
defined in study protocol. 
The rwRR rates will be estimated for each treatment cohort and compared by [CONTACT_815290].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analysis will be performed to exam the robustness of the primary analysis.  
Sensitivity analysis 1: Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW)
Inverse probability treatment weighting will be used to balance baseline demographic and 
clinical characteristics between comparison cohorts in this analyses ( Austin and Stuart, 
2015 ).

analysis by [CONTACT_815291].
Sensitivity analysis 2: Stratification by [CONTACT_815292] [ADDRESS_1128843].
Sensitivity analysis 3: Best tumor response imputation
For patients who did not have any post baseline tumor assessment information, their rwTR 
may be imputed using logistic regression predictive modelling to predict response for patients with similar baseline characteristics from known patients.

Page 34 of [IP_ADDRESS]. Subgroup Analyses 
While inclusion of patients between 2010 and 2015, allows for patient to be included in the 
control arm prior to palbociclib being approved, which may help to reduce bias in physician choice of treatment and allow for more patients being matched, however, the varying time periods between cohorts may be a limitation.
A subgroup analyses will be performed including patients only after palbociclib approval in 
the US. Patients included in this analysis with be those who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria during an index period on and after 01 February 2015 until on or before 30 June 2020.
Other subgroup analyses may be performed according to patient demographics and baseline 
characteristics as appropriate, based on availability of the data and sample sizes.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Analyses 
Descriptive analyses for patient baseline characteristics will be conducted.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analyses of AEs of Special Interest
The number of cases of pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) which are directly 
attributable to the treatment will be reported for each treatment cohort which occurred while on first line treatment plus 30 days. 
9.8. Quality Control
With the exception of supplementary vitality status and date of death, study data will 
originate in the EHR, then be extracted into a study dataset through a manual chart review process or programmatic queries. Following analytic file construction and deidentification process, the dataset will be securely transferred to [COMPANY_007]. Sites cannot enter data into the eCRF directly; to support consistency and accuracy of abstraction, dedicated abstractors from McKesson will have centralized access to the EHR from all practice sites, and enter retrospective data into the eCRF. 
This is a retrospective study, therefore issues of quality control at study sites, eg data 
clarification queries, do not apply. Analyses are programmed according the specifications in the protocol's SAP and all code and other technical artifacts are documented and stored following established programming practices on [COMPANY_007] servers and in [COMPANY_007]’s Global Document Management System. Quality control (QC) will follow the USON dataset’s standard procedure for quality control and assurance as described below.
For structured data, McKesson’s Data, Evidence and Insight (DEI) team conducts quality 
assurance checks on all analytics projects. The process includes both technical and clinical quality checks. Technical review of the dataset consists of identifying inappropriate values (eg, out of range, illogical), logical sequences and quantity of missing values. Illogical and missing data will be reported to the study team, which may opt to exclude or impute these

with expectations and prior publications. 
The quality assurance process includes the following areas:
•Project scope and study rules;
•Protocol/SAP development;
•Data extraction and integrity;
•Populated tables and Study Report development.
As results of quality assurance and quality control, McKesson confirms:
•The source of the data and/or results will be documented, and that results/data will be 
verified against the source;
•The internal consistency of the medical research data presented;
•The conclusions are objective, balanced and consistent with the study results;
•The format and content of the document are aligned with the agreed upon template 
and standards.
Quality control and validation of chart review (unstructured) data will occur in multiple 
phases. Chart review processes require that no interpretations be made during the data collection; instead, all data will be collected as documented by [CONTACT_815293]. Prior to full chart review, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_815263] 5% of the patient population, up to 25 patients. Charts will be reviewed by [CONTACT_815294]-rater reliability. Data Quality Specialists will review pi[INVESTIGATOR_815264], including implausible dates (ie, date of death prior to last date of treatment), non-standard treatments, results which are inconsistent with known clinical parameters or other clinical data which is inconsistent with known standards and outcomes. Chart review team will meet following pi[INVESTIGATOR_815265]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_815266]. If necessary, revisions to the tool and/or additional training will be implemented. 
Once the pi[INVESTIGATOR_815267], the remaining chart reviews will proceed. During 
this phase of chart review, Data Quality Specialists will perform random and detailed checks of the data by [CONTACT_815295]. The Data Quality Specialist will also initiate queries, quality control of randomly selected charts and review of final data set before submission to researcher. Finally, the researcher and study’s Biostatistician will provide a final examination of the final dataset by [CONTACT_815296] (IBRANCE®)

Page 37 of 49Biostatisticians use SAS programs to QC data sets provided either by a structured database 
pull and from manual chart review. The team of biostatisticians and data analysts maintains a library of programming codes and algorithms that are used to analyze and classify any variables required for analyses. These codes are validated by [CONTACT_815299]. Any discrepancies are discussed and shared with the primary coder, data management, and biostatistician team.
For the primary endpoint, rwRR, chart abstraction will be undertaken to capture all tumor 
assessments associated with the index treatment (AI monotherapy or palbociclib + AI) documented in progress notes by [CONTACT_44375]. Chart reviewers will classify these tumor assessments into the categories defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , as well as capture the dates 
of assessment and whether they were based on radiologic imaging reports. As described above, McKesson Data Quality Specialists will perform random and detailed checks of the tumor assessment data by [CONTACT_815295]. If questions arise during capture of tumor assessments, these will be addressed with the adjudication process defined above. 
Risks involved in the handling of data and mitigation strategies are described below: 
•Transferring from EHR to database. McKesson’s product management team 
manages the transfer of data entered into the EHR by [CONTACT_815300]. Primary data management is handled by [CONTACT_815301]. This is an automated process and does not require manual data entry. Prior to analysis the biostatistician will examine the data to ensure that all needed elements are within the datasets. During analysis, if the biostatistician discovers any data issues, this is first communicated to the project lead and/or research management for discussion. Data issues that require clinical judgement are examined and discussed with the physician investigator. Any systemic issues are then reported to the data management team. For instance, issues may be caused due to migration of data fromone server to another and the data management team must be notified of any abnormalities. Further, the data management team communicates with DEI leadership and biostatisticians regarding any upcoming changes in the data. 
•Transferring from EHR database to eCRF. There is not direct transfer from the 
database to the eCRF. Data entered into the eCRF is manually performed via chart abstraction. Subsequently, data that is captured in the eCRF is automatically transferred to a dataset within the eCRF application. The dataset can be pulled from the application via automated process that is manually initiated. A multipronged approach is taken to reduce the potential of capturing incorrect information from the chart via manual abstraction. First, fields in the eCRF are built with logic checks ensure data entered fit the parameters of the field and the study. Second, quality monitors perform checks on data captured by [CONTACT_815302]. Last, McKesson Data Quality Specialists perform QC on the data set to determine the overall quality level meets McKesson standards/expectations.

Page 38 of 499.9. Limitations of the Research Methods
9.9.1. Internal Validity of Study Design Measurement Error(s)/Misclassification(s)
This observational and retrospective study uses iKM EHR data. The iKM database is not 
collected for research purposes but for clinical practice reasons. This may impede the standardization of the data collection methods and instruments and the reporting practices of the physician. As with all administrative databases, iKM data are subject to coding errors of omission and commission. Problems with inadequate or inaccurate codes in the databases may introduce some level of misclassification bias of certain diagnoses, events, or procedures of interest in the study. Likewise, some variables of interest may not be as complete across the entire population. The iKM EHR contains information on patients only when they are seen by [CONTACT_815303]. Services and procedures provided outside of the USON are not captured by [CONTACT_532283], as well as drugs received by [CONTACT_815304]. A patient’s treatment history prior to his/her first encounter at a USON practice may be only available in physician progress notes and is not well captured in the iKM EHR. We cannot rule out the possibility that some patients coded as receiving being treatment naïve for advanced disease in iKM EHR actually had previous chemotherapy for advanced disease in healthcare facilities outside the USON.
To minimize this risk, a targeted chart review is being performed to verify patients’ 
eligibility and data elements that may not be reliably captured in structured fields. With chart review, progress notes and additional free-text can be reviewed to provide much richer source of information. All patients in the study sample will be selected for this chart review. 
Information BiasDue to the nature of the study design, there is potential for bias to be introduced into the 
calculations of clinical outcomes. Specifically, patients who initiated treatment during the patient identification period may be meaningfully different from other patients who initiated therapy prior or after the study identification period. To minimize this risk, the study observation period will begin on the date palbociclib was approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer so that the study cohorts will both represent the treatment landscape after this approval. 
ConfoundingThe iKM system is used for clinical practice reasons, not solely for research purposes. As 
such, associations but not causality can be detected, thus bias may be introduced by [CONTACT_35250]. For example, data may be collected with an intent-to-treat (ITT)approach, meaning based on when treatment is assigned rather than received. In particular, it will not be possible to determine if oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815268]. To reduce this potential for bias, an ITT approach will be used for analysis, with the assumption that all prescribed oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815269].

9.9.3. Analysis Limitations
As a retrospective observational study, data entry errors at the point of care may occur and 
influence the results. To reduce this risk, a targeted chart review will be performed to captureor verify data elements that may not be reliably sourced through structured data. Additionally, Section 9.8 describes the quality control process that will be taken to ensure 
data from the EHR are captured correctly, which includes additional verification of outlying and missing values. 
9.9.4. Limitations Due to Missing Data and/or Incomplete Data
Although data quality checks are conducted, it is possible that some variables of interest may 
not be as complete across the entire population. To reduce this risk, a targeted chart review will be performed to capture or verify data elements that may not be reliably sourced through structured data.
Prescriber bias is a component of real-world treatment patterns in the absence of 
randomization and with a change in standard of care and can be adjusted for when confounders are known with statistical approaches including propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting. Addressing unobserved variables presents greater challenges and requires the ability to discern their influence. The USON iKM EHR dataset represents information collected as part of routine clinical practice and thus has limitations typi[INVESTIGATOR_815270]. 
9.9.5. Real-World Tumor Response
Given the retrospective nature of the study, some limitations are present including those 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a data source where the primary purpose for collection was other than research. These include incomplete or missing data, potential for inaccurate data capture, lack of scheduled assessments and lack of standardized tumor assessments. In addition, response to treatment and disease progression were determined based on the individual treating physician’s clinical assessment or interpretation of radiographic scans or pathology results rather than a standard criterion such as RECIST.

REACTIONS REQUIREMENTS
Structured Data Analysis
This study involves data that exists as structured data by [CONTACT_815305] a 
combination of existing structured data and unstructured data, which will be converted to structured form during the implementation of the protocol solely by a computer using automated/algorithmic methods, such as natural language processing.
In these data sources, individual patient data are not retrieved or validated, and it is not 
possible to link (ie, identify a potential association between) a particular product and medical event for any individual. Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event (AE) (ie, identifiable patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be met.
Human Review of Unstructured DataThis study protocol requires human review of patient-level unstructured data; unstructured 
data refer to verbatim medical data, including text-based descriptions and visual depi[INVESTIGATOR_815271], such as medical records, images of physician notes, neurological scans, X-rays, or narrative fields in a database. The reviewer is obligated to report adverse events (AEs) with explicit attribution to any [COMPANY_007] drug that appear in the reviewed information (defined per the patient population and study period specified in the protocol). Explicit attribution is not inferred by a temporal relationship between drug administration and an AE but must be based on a definite statement of causality by a healthcare provider linking drug administration to the AE.
The requirements for reporting safety events on the non-interventional study (NIS) Adverse 
Event Monitoring (AEM) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety are as follows:
•All serious and non-serious AEs with explicit attribution to any [COMPANY_007] drug that 
appear in the reviewed information must be recorded and reported, within 24 hours of 
awareness, to [COMPANY_007] Safety using the NIS AEM Report Form.
•Scenarios involving drug exposure, including exposure during pregnancy, exposure 
during breast feeding, medication error, overdose, misuse, extravasation, lack of efficacy, and occupational exposure associated with the use of a [COMPANY_007] product must be reported, within [ADDRESS_1128847], 
the safety information identified in the unstructured data reviewed is captured in the Event Narrative section of the report form, and constitutes all clinical information known regarding these AEs. No follow-up on related AEs will be conducted.

A5481159, NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOLProtocol Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_1128848] one patient identifier (eg, gender, age as captured in the narrative field of the form) will be reported on the NIS AEM Report Form, thus allowing the report to be considered a valid one in accordance with pharmacovigilance legislation. All identifiers will be limited to generalities, such as the statement “A 35-year-old female...” or “An elderly male...” Other identifiers will have been removed. 
Additionally, the onset/start dates and stop dates for “Illness”, “Study Drug”, and “Drug 
Name” may be documented in month/year (mmm/yyyy) format rather than identifying the actual date of occurrence within the month /year of occurrence in the day/month/year (DD/MMM/YYYY) format.
All research staff members must complete the following [COMPANY_007] training requirements: 
•“YRR Training for Vendors Working on [COMPANY_007] Studies (excluding interventional 
clinical studies and non-interventional primary data collection studies with sites/investigators)”. 
These trainings must be completed by [CONTACT_539950]. All trainings include a “Confirmation of Training Certificate” (for signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_152550]) as a record of completion of the training, which must be kept in a retrievable format. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_539936]. 
Re-training must be completed on an annual basis using the most current Your Reporting 
Responsibilities training materials. 
12. PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by [CONTACT_1204], or if McKesson is aware of any new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of a [COMPANY_007] product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately.

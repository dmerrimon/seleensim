The REVEALPLAQUE  Study :  A pRospEctiVe, multic Enter study to AnaLyze PLAQUE  using  
CCTA  
 
 
  Study Objective Current clinically available methods to quantify coronary artery plaque 
noninvasively from CCTA data are largely manual and as a result, have 
limited utility, reproducibility, accuracy, and precision. An automated 
deep learning based artificial intelligence method for segmenting the 
vessel wall and atherosclerotic plaque from CCTA data has been 
developed . This study will evaluate the level of agreement between this 
noninvasive CCTA-based quantification and characterization of coronary 
atherosclerosis and invasive IVUS .       
 
Study Design Patients who have a stenosis in at least one major epi[INVESTIGATOR_754293]-guided invasive evaluation and/or treatment will be 
eligible for enrollment. Enrolling sites will have FFR CT analysis 
incorporated when indicated into their standard evaluation of CCTA 
scans. Data collected will include  CCTA and FFR CT images, full 
angiographic images, IVUS images, and if obtained, any other imaging 
or physiologic data including OCT, FFR, any NHPR (e.g., dPR, RFR, iFR, 
etc.), and pre- and post-stent implantation invasive data. All non-invasive 
and invasive data collected will be obtained as clinical practice consistent 
with standard clinical care.

I.   BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
HeartFlow, Inc. (‘HeartFlow’) provides a non -invasive method to determine the hemodynamic significance 
of CAD (FFR CT) from subject specific CCTA data using computational fluid dynamics under rest and 
simulated maximal coronary hyperemic conditions (Taylor 2013). Results from four  prospective trials 
suggest that FFR CT accurately predicts the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions when 
compared to invasively measured FFR (Koo 2011, Min 2012, Nørgaard 2014, Driessen 2 018). FFR CT is 
available in Japan, in many European countries (CE mark 2011), in Canada, and in the U.S. (De Novo 
510K clearance 2014).  
One of the next key areas of interest in non-invasive disease identification is con firming whether a deep-
learning based automated method for segmenting coronary atherosclerotic plaques can identify coro nary 
atherosclerotic plaque location, quantity, and type. Recent studies have shown the im portance of 
understanding plaque burden including non-calcified plaque and especially low att enuation plaque to 
better identify patients at risk of myocardial infarction (Thomsen 2016 ). A deep-learning based automated 
method for segmenting coronary atherosclerotic plaques which can quantify total plaque volume from 
CCTA has been designed and tested and now requires prospectively collected invasive imagi ng data to 
assess performance as compared to intravascular ultrasound imaging (IVUS), a gold st andard in plaque 
quantification (Voros 2011, Fischer 2013).  
In the REVEALPLAQUE study, all patients who have a stenosis confirmed by  [CONTACT_218716], have had FFR CT 
completed, and are scheduled to undergo IVUS will be eligible for enrollment.  Enrolling sites will hav e 
FFR CT analysis incorporated when indicated into their standard evaluation of CCTA scans.  All sites will 
provide demographic and medical history of enrolled subjects, CCTA and FFR images,  full angiographic 
images, IVUS images, and if obtained, any other imaging or physiologic data including OCT, FFR CT, any 
NHPR (e.g., dPR, RFR, iFR, etc.), and pre- and post-stent implan tation invasive data. All non-invasive 
and invasive data collected will be obtained as clinical practice consistent with standard clini cal care. 
Data may be used to train deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms for  image segmentation and 
physiological modeling, to improve current and future products.    
 
II. STUDY OBJECTIVE

to medication, side branch occlusion, slow/no flow )       
 
 
 
 
V. E. Follow up 
No follow up with the subjects will be done as a part of this study. 
 
VI. STUDY DURATION 
The anticipated enrollment duration of the REVEALPLAQUE study wi ll be approximately [ADDRESS_1032380] informs the Investigator that they want to withdraw.  Wit hdrawn subjects will be considered screen 
failures if the collected data does not allow for adequate selection criteria assessment. 
VI. B. Screen Failures 
Subjects who sign consent will be deemed a screen failure if: 
● Automatic pullback for IVUS catheter was not used during the procedure 
● Prior to IVUS, the vessel was predilated (medications OK) 
     No data beyond reason for screen failure will be collected. 
VI. C. Rules for Terminating the Study 
There are no formal termination criteria for this study. The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the 
REVEALPLAQUE study at any time. Investigators have the responsibility to comply  with all applicable 
regulatory guidelines and regulations. Specific reasons which may cause the sponsor,  IRB, or local 
regulatory authorities to terminate a center include, but are not limited t o:  
1) Failure of the investigator to comply with investigator agreement, protocol, guideli nes, and/or 
regulations.  
2) Serious protocol violations. 
3) Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to t he sponsor, clinical 
monitor, or other party involved in the study.  
 
VII. SAFETY ASSESSMENT 
Subjects will undergo a clinically indicated ICA and invasive physiological meas urements, which do not 
require additional radiation, extra contrast, or additional procedure time for  this study/protocol. All 
procedures performed will be per standard clinical care and with adherence to revascularization 
guidelines and data obtained will be documented. Therefore, there will be no additional clinical risks for 
subjects who participate. Procedural complications will be documented (i.e., di ssection from catheter or 
wire, reaction to medication).

REVEALPLAQUE Study Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_1032381] been planned as part of routine clinical practice; 
therefore, no additional clinical risks are related to participating in the s tudy. Procedural complications 
will be documented that are related to IVUS or FFR (e.g.,. dissection from cathe ter or wire, reaction to 
medication). 
 
IX. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
IX. A.  General Considerations 
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study , with confidence 
intervals and hypothesis testing performed for the primary and other selected efficacy endpoints. 
Unless stated otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics”  refers to number of events (n), mean, median, 
standard deviation (SD), standard error, minimum, maximum, and coefficient of  variation (CV) for 
continuous data and frequencies and percentages for categorical data.  
All data collected during the study will be included in data listings.  
Unless specified otherwise, all statistical testing will be two-sided and will be pe rformed using an overall 
significance (alpha) level of 0.05.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® System, version 9.1.3 or higher.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will describe the methods of data collection, val idation, analysis, and 
reporting. The sections below provide a brief overview of statistical consideration  for the study. 
IX. B.  Subject Characteristics  
Subject accountability will be described, including number of subjects enrolled, number of subjects 
included in the analysis, and reasons for any subjects discontinued from the study or not i ncluded in the 
analysis. Demographic information will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Sex and  medical 
histories will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335].   
IX. C.  Endpoint Analysis 
The primary endpoint is to assess the level of agreement between total plaque volume o f a deep-learning 
based automated method for segmenting coronary atherosclerotic plaques, compared to IVUS,  on a per-
IVUS-pullback level.  
Bland Altman plots will be constructed. If the deep -learning based automated method CCTA 
measurements fall with the limits of agreement (LoA) estimated from th e IVUS measurements, the DocuSign Envelope ID: 79C9324E-EE95-458E-9DED-D4F328BC6960
REVEALPLAQUE Study Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_1032382] 12th, 2021 
CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.0  Page 15 of 17 
 measures will be assumed to agree. Additionally, Pearson’s correlation and paired t -test will be 
constructed to further describe the relationship between IVUS measurements and deep -learning based 
automated method for segmenting coronary atherosclerotic plaques from CCTA. 
All secondary endpoints which are continuous (e.g., per lesion total plaque volume, per l esion calcium 
volume, per lesion low attenuation volume, per lesion non-calcified plaque volume, segment 
involvement score) will be similarly compared using a Bland Altman plot, Pearson’s correlati on and 
paired t-tests. Reproducibility will be estimated with Intra Class correlation (IC C).  
IX. D.  Sample Size  
Approximately 250 subjects may be enrolled into this study. 
From published data (Conte 2019), the maximum allowable difference between the measuremen ts is 
[ADDRESS_1032383] deviation of 12 mm3, a sample size of 223 patients achieves 90% power 
to detect agreement when the mean is 8, confidence level of the (LoA) is 0.[ADDRESS_1032384] with 
eCRF completion. All site staff including investigators and research coordinators w ill undergo site 
initiation training to become thoroughly familiar with the protocol, case report f orms, and with methods of 
data verification. 
X. C. Archiving of Data  
All study data collected at the investigator site and sponsor site will be archived in accordance  with local

 XI. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
XI. A. Institutional Review  
Before starting this study, the protocol approved by [CONTACT_754306]/local health authorities, as required, in accordance with local regulation s and to the IRB. The study 
will not start before the IRB gives written approval or a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_754298]/local health authorities. 
No changes from the final approved protocol will be initiated without the I RB’s prior written ap proval or 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_754299]. The sponsor will authorize any protoco l amendments, if 
necessary. Significant protocol amendments should be submitted to the IRB without de lay.  
XI. B. Guidelines for Obtaining Subject Informed Consent  
Written informed consent approved by [CONTACT_754307], or their 
legal guardian as required according to section V.B. Subject Selection.  
XI. C. Site Initiation/Training  
Prior to sites enrolling subjects, the sponsor or its designee will contact [CONTACT_754308].  This visit will include the prot ocol review the data requirements for 
the study, including eCRF completion instructions, PI [INVESTIGATOR_387825], and to ensur e all other applicable 
regulatory documents and trainings are completed.  
XI. D. Study Monitoring and Audit  
Edit checks will be included in the study database to ensure that out of rang e values are checked prior 
to inclusion in the dataset. If unusual outliers are found in any of the individu al study populations, an audit 
plan may be developed at that time.  
XI. E.  Clinical Events Committee 
There will not be a Clinical Events Committee for this study. 
XI. F.  IVUS Core Lab 
There will be an IVUS core lab responsible for annotating the angio images, IVUS ima ges, and HeartFlow 
provided Paraview models according to predefined study workflows. These workflows wi ll be the joint 
responsibility of HeartFlow and the core lab and will be approved by [CONTACT_754309]. All imaging data and annotations will be housed in a centralized EDC database.  
XI. G.  HeartFlow Technology / Data Team  
The HeartFlow technology / data team will be responsible for exporting the coronary models for all 
enrolled subjects via Paraview and uploading them into the EDC system for the cor e lab.  
Following the core lab analysis and blinded to the core lab results, the technolog y/data team will have 
access to the x,y,z coordinates from the annotated Paraview models and will use tho se to determine 
the plaque volume from the deep -learning based automated method for segmenting coronary 
atherosclerotic plaques from CCTA. Further details will be included in the stud y manuals separate from 
the main protocol. 
 
XII. FINAL REPORT 
Following conclusion of the study, a final report from HeartFlow or it ’s designee and may be distributed 
to all investigators. This final report will include all enrolled, eligible subjec ts. DocuSign Envelope ID: 79C9324E-EE95-458E-9DED-D4F328BC6960

Protocol Version 11  
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is directly linked to greater fat accrual and retention1 shifting 83% of 
normal weight women into an overweight or obese BMI category at [ADDRESS_1149139]-pregnancy2. Excessive GWG, 
experienced by 56% of U.S. pregnant women3,4, increases offspring fat accrual and risk for overweight or 
obesity development, a characteristic of 31.8% of US children5. Excess adiposity  levels drive disease 
development6, leading to the prediction of a rapid generational decline in life expectancy7 and a surge in 
medical care costs (~$150 billion/yr)8.  
 D uring normal pregnancy , maternal metabolism  shifts  to support fetal growth9 likening to the development 
of the metabolic syndrome (MetS)10-13 including increases in : fat mass10,11, blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]12, coagulation13, 
inflammation, and insulin resistance12. No intervention has been design considering the MetS state of 
pregnancy. Further, prior interventions to prevent excessive GWG were designed based on successful non-
pregnant adult weight loss  studies14, however, incremental weight gain is critical for fetal development. M eta-
analyses  reported a minimal  effect of prior interventions15-[ADDRESS_1149140] of a high fiber (HFib) diet (>30g/day), designed to address the unique MetS state of pregnancy, to reduce GWG, fat accretion, and improve maternal diet quality.  
 The benefits of a HFib diet are supported extensively in the literature. F iber protects against increasing 
body weight
30-33, promotes fat loss34-39, increases satiety40, and improves the metabolic and inflammatory 
profiles30,41-47. Evidence that a HFib diet can reduce body weight and fat mass independent of a reduction in 
energy intake was highlighted in a recent meta-analysis48 and a RCT in adults with MetS49,50. The effect is 
hypothesized in part to be mediated through the powerful prebiotic effect of fiber that favorably shifts  the gut 
microbiota leading t o reduced weight gain48, inflammation51, improved metabolic profile51, and prevention of fat 
accrual34-37,51. Our working hypothesis is that consuming a HFib  diet (≥30 g/day) will reduce GWG  and fat 
accretion by [CONTACT_828177] , reducing hunger thereby [CONTACT_720740], and changing the gut 
bacteria composition. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (n=20) found a 12 wk HFib pregnancy intervention reduced Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes, which was associated with reduced weight gain and fat accretion
52. Current fiber 
intake of pregnant women  is 17.3 g/day53, well below the recommended intake (28 g/day54), and triggering fiber 
to be classified as a nutrient of concern55. Thus , increasing fiber intake has high potential for impact. However, 
RCTs in pregnant women are lacking to understand if this is an effective intervention strategy . 
      The  project objective is to block randomize n=56 pregnant women to either a HFib  diet or usual care. 
Eighteen weekly lessons will educate women on eating a HFib  diet. To ensure fiber intake is met, daily snacks 
(10-12 g/day) will be provided. Weight gain, fat accretion, and stool microbiota will be measured twice during 
pregnancy (pre- and post-intervention) and assessed at 2 months , 6 months, and 12 months  postpartum. 
Infant body composition will be measured at 2 weeks ,2 months , 6 months, and 12 months . The aims are:   
 
Primary Aim 1 : Assess the between group difference in maternal weight gain and fat accretion. H1: The 
HFib group will gain less weight and accrue less fat mass when compared to the control group.  
 
Primary Aim 2 : Compare fiber intake and diet ary quality between groups. H2: The HFib  group will 
consume more fiber  and have a higher diet quality  during pregnancy and postpartum.  
 
2 
  Secondary Aim 1: Characterize between group differences in the gut microbiome composition and 
diversity (alpha and beta) . H1: The HFib group will have a greater change in gut microbiota composition, 
taxonomy, and diversity that will be detected during pregnancy and postpartum.  
 
Secondary Aim 2: Determine if there are between group differences in early infant fat accrual. H2 : 
Offspri ng born to women in the HFib group will have lower fat accrual.  
 
Secondary Aim 3: Determine if there are differences in markers of metabolic, inflammatory, and brain health 
during pregnancy and postpartum. H3 : The HFib  group will be characterized by [CONTACT_828178], inflammatory, and brain health markers at all time points measured.  
 
Impact: Prior intervention design has not addressed the MetS state of normal pregnancy. Dietary fiber 
counteracts the c omponents of the MetS. Increasing fiber intake may positively impact the drivers of poor 
maternal outcomes that prior studies failed to show. Our study has potential to succeed where others have 
failed because we designed treatment to target the metabolic shifts that occur during normal pregnancy . This 
proposal  is innovative because we are measuring the intervention impact on fat accrual and the microbiota in 
mother and early offspring fat accrual. This proposal would fill a large research gap.  
 
RESEARCH STRATEGY  
A) SIGNIFICANCE  
A1) Why maternal excessive weight gain is an important problem : Overall, 55% of women gain excessive 
gestational weight3,[ADDRESS_1149141] within BMI groups; 62% of women with a high normal BMI (22-
24.9 kg/m2) and ~70% of overweight and obese women gain excessively3,4. Maternal overweight and 
excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with poor offspring outcomes including increased 
infant fat mass (FM)3,56 and increased FM in childhood57,58 and adulthood59. Research shows a strong 
relationship between maternal excessive GWG and offspring obesity development60,61, diabetes, and 
cardiovascular disease62,63. Maternal conditions related to excessive GWG include hypertension64,65 and 
gestational diabetes (GDM)66,67. Many women develop overweight or obesity during the childbearing years68. 
Women who gain excessively are more likely to retain [ADDRESS_1149142] yet to be tested, proven viable, or successful. Many primary care physicians do not counsel patients on weight loss, diet, and exercise due to inadequate resources and feelings of ineffectiveness
70. This highlights 
the importance of interventions during pregnancy . Pregnancy is an important time period that “programs” 
disorders and a time when many pregnant women are more likely to adopt healthy behaviors for the well -being 
of their baby14. Several interventions have been completed with varying success and are discussed below.  
 A2) Intervention lack of success: Four meta-analyses
16,18,20,24 and five systematic reviews15,22-25 show limited 
success in published interventions. For interventions including diet and physical activity (PA), three71-73 found 
improvement in rate of adherence to IOM guidelines while ten74-83 did not see improvements in adherence. 
Studies compared differences by [CONTACT_828179]/obese participants
84,85. Two studies in obese pregnant women provided counseling with a 
Registered Dietitian at one session86 or [ADDRESS_1149143] success (80% gained <10.6 kg) was found in a study of overweight/obese 
women using personalization of diet and PA (walking program using pedometers) and consistent self-monitoring
72. This study was especially impressive as the intervention started at 16-20 wks and the entire 
cohort had already gained excessively.   
 A3) Lessons from prior studies: Failed studies cite poor outcomes were due to PA  not being desirable during 
pregnancy
79, needing one provider delivering counseling to ensure consistent messages74, the intervention 
was not intensive enough75,84,85, too infrequent of contact75,79,84, the need to emphasize caloric restriction84, the 
intervention started too late78 or was too short79, the need to involve significant others76, and poor 
adherence75,81. Successful studies were intensive, set calorie and PA goals and used self-monitoring20. 
3 
  Interventions predominantly based on diet only (e.g., a single goal (SG)) versus interventions changing multiple 
behaviors (e.g., multiple goal (MG)) were suggested to be the most effective20. This is hypothesized to be 
because the MG approach requires focus on several messages resulting in the intensity of the intervention being diluted, because there is better adherence in SG diet only interventions with only one behavior to focus on changing, and specific components in the SG diet interventions might have benefits not explored
20.  
 A4) Benefits of dietary fiber : One identified nutrient thought to exert this beneficial effect is dietary fiber. Data 
suggest that dietary fiber can aid in weight loss and maintenance
88-90, promote satiety and reduce hunger40, 
reduce inflammation91, and exert clinical benefits by [CONTACT_828180], insulin levels and lipid levels49,92. 
NHANES 2005-2010 data found in adult males and females the average intake of fiber is only 16.8 g/day93 
which is well below the recommended intake of 25 g/day for females and 38 g/day for males54. Studies report a 
high fiber diet in non-pregnant adults was rated as acceptable to maintain for six months40. The maternal 
physiologic state changes during the course of normal pregnancy to support the growth of the fetus9. As 
pregnancy progresses the metabolic adaptations occurring represent a transient excursion into a metabolic syndrome (MetS) like state, one that is analogous to the worsening of the metabolic profile seen during development of MetS. Dietary fiber exerts protective benefits on several components of metabolic syndrome
94 
that could be beneficial during pregnancy.   
 
A5) Success of a SG intervention: In a large RCT funded by [CONTACT_18121] (R01 HL094575)50 in non-pregnant 
adults with MetS, the effectiveness of two interventions were compared for weight loss and metabolic changes; 
MG vs. SG. Both groups met face-to-face (FTF) in groups for 12 sessions over three months. The MG followed 
the American Heart Association dietary guidelines and the SG focused all lessons on achieving dietary fiber (no calorie or PA goals) intake ≥30 g/day. At [ADDRESS_1149144] -
2.1 kg and both groups saw improvements in dietary quality, insulin resistance, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], inflammation, glucose 
levels and blood pressure. Both groups decreased kcal/d, however the MG group had a greater decrease ( -
464 versus - 200 kcal at 12 months). Olendski
49 tested the effectiveness two simple messages in a three group 
design: 1) calorie restriction + high fiber, 2) calorie restriction + low saturated fat and 3) MG intervention (a 
combination of restricted kcals, high fiber, and low fat). The intervention lasted [ADDRESS_1149145]; 
-7 lbs for MG, -9.1 lbs for fiber and, -10.2 lbs for saturated fat group. All groups improved dietary quality and 
cardiometabolic parameters. At six months, 83% of the fiber group were confident they could stick to their diet, whereas only 60% and 33% were confident in the saturated fat and MG groups, respectively (p=0.008). Taken together, no clear between group differences were found between a SG dietary fiber intervention and a MG intervention. This suggests in non-pregnant adults, both intervention types were effective.  
 
 A6) Promising new intervention approach: Encouraging appropriate GWG by [CONTACT_828181]
95.  FTF 
individual counseling is effective but expensive and difficult to scale up for dissemi nation96. Group based phone 
couns eling (GBPC) is novel and efficiently uses both the time and resources of the providers and participants. 
Pregnant women report9 lack of time, resources and need for childcare as barriers to participating in lifestyle 
interventions. Participants “meet” as a group weekly by [CONTACT_6292] a Registered Dietitian. GBPC interventions 
are effective for weight management in non-pregnant populations97,[ADDRESS_1149146] used GBPC to encourage appropriate GWG in pregnant 
women or used a novel intervention to pregnancy, a SG dietary fiber intervention.   
 B) Innovation: The proposed research is innovative because of the research team, the research design and 
idea, and the techniques used. Our team is using existing science to deliver interventions to high risk and high 
need patients. We are filling a research and clinical  gap by [CONTACT_828182]. Using a SG 
intervention for weight loss and to improve metabolic health has been proven successful in non-pregnant 
adults but remains un-tested in pregnancy
50. In pregnancy, the goal is not to induce weight loss, but blunt the 
rate of excessive gain. Promotion and adherence to a healthy lifestyle is of the utmost importance during 
pregnancy because we can positively impact the health of the mother and her baby.

C) Approach/Preliminary Studies 
C1) Preliminary study: multiple goal behavioral lifestyle intervention to reduce excessive GWG : Drs. 
Hull and Goetz were co- PIs funded on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_828165] a multiple goal  behavioral 
lifestyle intervention (vs. UC) to prevent excessive GWG using GBPC. The primary outcome was the proportion of women gaining excessively based on [ADDRESS_1149147] zero subjects in the intervention. In the intervention 
group, 29% gained excessively while 78% of the UC group gained excessively. Additionally, the UC gr oup 
gained more weight (p=0.010). Structured interviews were done in a sample of those completing the study (n=9). When asked, “What changes did you make due to the intervention?”, 33% responded, “consumed more 
fruits/vegetables ” and “controlled portions ” while 22% said “consumed less sugar”. When asked “What they 
liked about the program?”, 44% replied “ monitoring body weight”. When asked “What they would recommend 
for future interventions?”, responses included, keep a variety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_828166] . 
The data are promising.

C2) Population to be studied: Women between 9 to 19 weeks pregnant with a BMI 18.5 – 45.0 kg/m2 and 
between the ages of 18- 45 years will be recruited from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) OB 
clinics. We will enroll all race/ethnic groups. Participant’s routine OB care will be managed by [CONTACT_828183]. Any interventions, laboratory or other evaluations, and decisions regarding delivery will be made 
by [CONTACT_828184]. Groups of 6-[ADDRESS_1149148] 18 
weeks, ensuring intervention completion by 38 weeks in pregnancy. We will screen women to determine the 
current dietary fiber intake. If they are consuming 25 g/day of fiber or more , they will be excluded from the 
study. Women who do not have internet and phone access will be excluded from the study. Participants must be willing to consume provided snacks. Participants will also be excluded if they have  history of gestational 
diabetes (GDM), diabetes, pre-eclamp sia, hypertension,  heart disease, hypothyroidism, or other metabolic 
abnormalities, current hyperemesis gravidarum, eating disorder, smok ing, or are pregnant with multiples. 
Women that develop any of these medical conditions during pregnancy will be accounted for in the final 
analysis. Deviations from inclusion criteria will be at the discretion of the PI. 
 C3) Recruitment: We have access to the electronic clinic schedule, therefore we have the exact date and time 
of the recruit’s OB visit. We have worked directly with physicians and staff providing an in service at meetings to ensure a smooth recruiting process so that we do not impede clinic flow. Annually, [ADDRESS_1149149] from previous studies will also be approached if eligible via email 
or phone.  
   C4) Curric ulum development: The interventions were designed based on the theoretical framework of the 
social cognitive theory (SCT)
102. Bandura proposed that people attain and then maintain patterns of behavior 
and that behavior is based on the interaction of personal, environmental and behavioral factors. The 
consistency of behavior provides the foundation for development of our intervention strategy. Within the SCT 
there are several constructs that are directly related to weight control programs103,104. Table 2 provides 
examples of the constructs and behavioral strategies and examples of how these will be used in the study.

  Behavior Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_828168].  
Goal Setting  The Dietitian teaches sensible goal setting and assists participants to set personalized goals (e.g., 
fiber intake) to achieve appropriate GWG.  
Self-Monitoring  Participants will report their body weight and fiber intake weekly & be taught self -monitoring.  
Feedback & Reinforcement  Participants receive weekly feedback that includes reinforcement & strategies to overcome barriers.  
Social/Peer Support  Group sessions provide peer support and interaction to model and teach behaviors.  
Stimulus Control  Lessons provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] & behavioral strategies to decrease cues for undesirable behaviors and to 
increase those for healthy behaviors.  
Relapse Prevention  The Dietitian facilitates the development of a contingency plan to address high risk situations based 
on Marlatt and Gordon’s relapse prevention model 105 
 
C5) General intervention description: Group video conferencing will be used to deliver the intervention. The 
weekly 60- minute lessons for the Hfib group provide information on how to obtain ≥30 g/day of fiber (details 
below).  
 
C5a) General layout of the group sessions: The session will start with a review of the prior week’s goals, with 
support and encouragement from group members and the Dietitian (5-10 minutes). A group discussion will 
occur with group members relating and/or providing personal insight and support. The Dietitian will lead 
discussion and engage the women by [CONTACT_828185] , providing encouragement and 
troubleshooting as needed. Each week there will be a structured lesson with an assignment to be completed 
after the session (20-30 minutes). The last 10-[ADDRESS_1149150] group dynamics on video, 5-10 women are optimal.  
 
C5b) Video System : Group sessions will be conducted using Zoom video conferencing system (Zoom Video 
Communications, Inc., San Jose, CA). Participants will be given a link with a password and instructed to call in 5 minutes prior to group start. A log will be generated to track attendance. All conference calls will be recorded 
for quality assurance and to serve as additional training for the group leader.  
 
C5c) Hfib intervention details: The 60 -minute weekly group sessions ( 18 total) will focus on eating a high fiber 
diet both during and after pregnancy. The dietary reference intake (DRI) for fiber during pregnancy is 28 g/day and 25 g/day for females of reproductive age
54. The goal is for participants to gain within 2009 IOM 
recommendations69. To achieve this, all participants will be encouraged to consume ≥30 g/day of fiber. The 
Hfib intervention will receive a fiber goal (no calorie goal). This is intentional because we want to remove the 
driver of what is known to induce weight loss (calorie goal) and determine if a fiber goal without a calorie goal 
can blunt excess GWG. Because the goal is to keep the Hfib  intervention simple, we are focusing on the one 
behavior with the best evidence to control weight gain; consuming ≥30 g/day fiber. Discussion will encourage 
problem solving, provide educational information, and social engagement during the video calls. Participants 
will be taught to track their daily total fiber intake in REDCap.  Participants will be encouraged to follow a 
balanced diet emphasizing fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low -fat dairy and lean protein. General PA 
recommendations during pregnancy will be mentioned but no focus or reinforcement of this behavior will take 
place . All participants will be given a body weight scale and report body weight weekly. Participants will 
receive a notebook containing handouts and assignments specific to each weekly topic. Dietitians will facilitate 
the lessons and lead discussion.  
 In order  to improve adherence to a high fiber diet, all  participants  will recei ve daily high fiber snacks (see table 
3). In pregnant women, the average daily fiber intake is 15 g/day. Therefore, by [CONTACT_828186],  we will 
increase the fiber intake to close  to the goal of ≥30 g/day  fiber. The box will include multiple flavors  of Kind 
bars, chickpeas  and snap  peas. Additionally, they will receive whole grain cereals  including whole wheat 
puffins  and wheat Chex.  All foods  are shelf stable  from [ADDRESS_1149151] of high fiber snacks for one week.

C5d) Monitoring & Compliance: Participants will submit a daily log electronically through REDCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) to report number of servings of high fiber food groups (e.g., fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds). Participants will be given a body weight scale and asked to report their body weight weekly.Research staff will review compliance weekly and contact [CONTACT_828187]. Participants will be flagged for follow -up if they are not attending calls, not completing 
daily REDCap logs, or if they are consistently below their fiber goal as assessed by [CONTACT_828188] 24-hour recalls. 
Participants will also be contact[CONTACT_828189] a body weight change ± 5 pounds over two weeks. 
 
C5e) Usual care group: Those randomized to the UC group will be cared for by [CONTACT_828190].  Standard treatment consists of attending regularly scheduled visits where patients are 
weighed and evaluated. The standard visit schedule is once monthly until [ADDRESS_1149152] the rate of excessive GWG, as the rate of excessive GWG in the control group was 78%. 
 
C5f) Adherence: Adherence will be assessed based on participants meeting their prescribed fiber goal 
(≥30g/day average) as well as by [CONTACT_828191] ≥75% (14 or more calls attended). Starting in week two of the intervention, one 24-hour dietary recall will be collected every two weeks (9 recalls total) to determine fiber intake. Participants will be considered adherent if their number of days meeting fiber goal/number of days reported is ≥75%.
 
 C6) Standard training and quality assurance: [CONTACT_765870] has considerable experience (over 10 years) 
delivering weight management interventions and as a trainer (R01 DK076063, HL11842, DK094833). [CONTACT_765870] will provide initial and ongoing training for the Dietitians who will lead the group sessions . [CONTACT_765870] will 
randomly select 20% of the calls and using the checklist, make sure >80% of the content was covered. If >80% of the content was not covered, the Dietitian will be re-trained focusing on deficient areas.   
 C7) Maternal & infant assessments: Listed in Table 4 is an outline of study visits and procedures. In C 7a-i, 
details are provided regarding maternal & infant outcomes that will be collected.

C7a) Gestational weight gain: GWG will be calculated following the NIH LIFE -Moms protocol106. Self-reported 
pre-pregnancy weight will be replaced with baseline study measured body weight and subtracted from weight 
measured at [ADDRESS_1149153]. GWG guidelines will be used to classify excessive GWG
69.  
 
C7b) Questionnaires : Questionnaires will be given to assess maternal pregnancy and infant birth 
characteristics  at study visits, via REDCap surveys, and over the phone throughout the study . Examples 
include maternal health (medical and obstetric history), self-reported race/ethnic background, income, 
education, household information (marital status, baby [INVESTIGATOR_800884] ’s health, etc.), hunger and satiety, emotional 
health, gastrointestinal health, supplement use, alcohol  consumption, drug use, infant sex, birth weight, birth 
length, and gestational age, to name a few107-109. One survey  will ask about liking  or disliking of foods to assess 
perception of taste and olfaction, which can influence what foods people choose to eat. The survey will be 
taken through a link (https://uconn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aVFeLIsOTSVSCzk ) which is hosted by  [CONTACT_828192]. Once the survey has been 
scored, the results will be sent to the study team. No identifying information except a participant ID will be included in the survey.  
 
C7c) Satisfaction survey : Satisfaction will be measured with three questions measured on a 5-point Likert scale 
at the completion of the study: “How confident are you that you will stick to the study diet?”; “I am always hungry on this diet”; and “This diet is a benefit to my health”. Responses for the confidence question will be: not at all, not very, somewhat, very and extremely confident. Responses for the hunger and benefit to health 
questions will be: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree and strongly disagree.     
 
C7d) 24-hour dietary recall: Three m ultiple-pass 24-hour dietary recalls (2 weekday and 1 weekend day) will be 
collected by [CONTACT_176187], end of intervention, and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum  to 
characterize energy and nutrient intake (1 in person, 2 via phone per each visit using a standardized food 
amounts booklet). One 24-hour recall will be obtained every four  weeks during the intervention to assess fiber 
goal adherence,  Multiple-pass 24-hour recalls accurately estimate dietary intake110,111 and contain less 
reporting bias than diet records110,112. One 24-hour dietary recall will be administered to the child’s caregiver at 
2 weeks , 2 months , 6 months, and 12 months  to characterize the diet of the child. The recalls will be entered 
into the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS -R, version 2020, Minneapolis, MN) for macro- and 
micronutrient analysis.   
 
C7e) Fecal Sample Collection: Stool will be collected five times throughout the study (baseline, end 
intervention, and 2, 6 and 12 months postpartum)  from the mother and four times throughout the study from 
the infant (2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months).  OMNIgene GUT and OMNImet GUT stool collection 
kits (DNAGenotek, Canada)  will be shipped to women with specific instructions on collection and storage at 
home. Women will bring collected samples to their study visit.  DNA extraction will be completed at KUMC 
under the supervision of [CONTACT_828210].  Library preparation and microbial profiling using 16S V4 sequencing will be completed at KU Lawrence.  
8 
   
C7f) Anthropometry: Body weight will be assessed on the same calibrated scale (Detetco Scales, Webb City, 
MO) throughout the study duration for the mother and a calibrated pediatric scale for the infant (Scale-Tronix, 
White Plains, NY). Height will be measured using a wall mounted stadiometer (Accu-Hite, Seca Corp, Hanover, 
MD) for the mother and length using a length board (Shorr Productions) for the infant.  Two or more 
measurements will be taken, and the average recorded. Infant head and waist circumferences will be 
measured two or more times, and the average recorded. 
 
C7g) Maternal and infant body composition: Maternal body composition will be assessed using the Selinger 
four-compartment model113 at baseline, end of intervention, and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum. The 4C 
model includes body mass, body volume, total body water, and bone mineral content. Percent fat will be 
determined by [CONTACT_8028]: %FM = ([2.747/BD] – [0.714*TBW/BW] + [1.129*B/BW] – 2.037) x 100; where BD 
is body density in kg/L, TBW is total body water in L, B is bone mineral in kg, and BW is body weight in kg11. 
Body mass will be measured by [CONTACT_792147] (Detetco Scales, Webb City, MO). Body volume will be assessed via air displacement plethysmography
26 (BodPod®; CosMed, Concord, CA)114. Women will wear 
minimal tight-fitting clothing (e.g. one -pi[INVESTIGATOR_828169]) and a fitted hat. Body density will be calculated as body 
mass/body volume. Total body water will be assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA; Tanita, 
Inc., TBF-310, Tokyo, Japan)115. Bone mineral content will be measured by [CONTACT_751] -energy X-ra y absorptiometry 
(DXA; GE Healthcare, Lunar Prodigy, Madison, WI). DXA is contraindicated during pregnancy since radiation emission is considered harmful to the fetus
116, so bone mineral content will be assessed at 2 weeks 
postpartum1,11,117. Infant body composition will be assessed via air  displacement plethysmography26 (PeaPod®; 
CosMed, Concord, CA)114 at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months  (if infant ≤10kg). Infants are tested nude with a 
tight fitting hat3. Our Pea Pod® system  has the larger tray allowing testing of infants with a body weight up to 10 
kg.  
 
C7h) Maternal and infant DXA: Dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA; Prodigy, Madison, WI, encore software 
version 13.60) will be used to measure body composition and regional adipose tissue distribution. The DXA is 
located within the Dietetics & Nutrition Clinic inside the Smith West building at KUMC. Using specific anatomic 
landmarks as previously described, regions including the arms, legs and trunk will be demarcated118. 
Calculations for FM in each region and summed for regions comprising the central (trunk) and peripheral (arms plus legs) will be completed. If a child moves during the scan the scan may need to be re-done at the same or 
later visit, but no more than 6 total scans will be given over the duration of the study.  
 Pregnant women violate the assumptions used in other body composition methods, so a four-
compartment model is  performed where each component is measured separately to get a more accurate 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]. The components include body mass, body volume, total body water, and bone mineral content. Since 
DXA is contraindicated in pregnancy, the bone mineral content component will be assessed via the DXA at 2 
month postpartum to determine body composition during pregnancy. At 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months 
postpartum , a maternal DXA scan will be obtained because DXA is the only precise technique for measuring 
the location of body fat. Other body composition techniques give an estimate of total body fat only. DXA gives 
a measurement of central  and peripheral fat and has the capability to  estimate visceral adipose tissue (VAT). 
Central body fat (fat located around the organs ), especially VAT, carries a much higher disease risk  than 
peripheral body fat (fat in the extremities). Adults with type [ADDRESS_1149154] higher levels of centrally located fat, whereas fat located in the peripheral region is cardioprotective
118,119. For the 
infants, DXA is the only precise technique for measuring amount and location of body fat longitudinally. The PeaPod
® can only measure infants up to [ADDRESS_1149155] benefit to the infant, the information obtained will yield generalizable 
knowledge of vital importance to this population. The prenatal period is shown in literature to be related t o 
offspring obesity development and disease risk. Overall, 55% of women gain excessive gestational weight4. 
Excessive GWG leads to higher infant fat mass at birth3,56, and therefore higher  childhood fat mass57,59-61. 
Overweight and obesity in childhood are related to disease development later in life, leading to the 
development of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease6,62,63. With the current obesity 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], it is critical to understand if we can intervene during the prenatal period to impact fat ac cumulation 
9 
  and distribution in the infants, which are important drivers of obesity occurrence, disease risk, and severity of 
disease development.  
 
C7i) Process evaluation: Data will be collected throughout the intervention to assess barriers to recruitment 
and study retention, participant acceptability and intervention adherence, and how well the intervention was 
implemented. Participants that drop will be contact[CONTACT_387736] a brief interview to provide 
feedback. Semi -structured interviews will be conducted at the final  assessment (34 wks). Participants will be 
asked about their perception of the intervention including both positive and negative aspects and any 
challenges that were encountered, pros and cons of using group video c ounseling to promote healthy  
behaviors during pregnancy, and their overall satisfaction with the intervention. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Comments will be coded, categorized into themes and used to refine and 
further develop future interventions.  
 
C7j) Safety  monitoring: All subjects will be given a body weight scale and report body weight weekly. This 
allows close supervision of progression of each participant to ensure the intervention is not overly effective and all women are gaining adequate body weight. If a woman gains or loses more than 5 lbs over a two-week 
period, she will be flagged and contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If she is in the Hfib group, total weight gain recommendations will be 
reviewed and her dietary habits and fiber intake will be reviewed and reinforced. Rapid weight changes  or any 
other safety concerns  will be reviewed by [CONTACT_828193]. The participant’s pr ovider 
will be notified if physician deems necessary.  
 
C7k) Maternal blood draw : Maternal venous blood will be collected at 5 times through the study (baseline, end 
of intervention, 2 months , 6 months, and 12 months  postpartum) after an overnight fast by a trained 
phlebotomist. A total of two  4-mL EDTA (lavender top) tubes (1 will be filled ½ full), one 10-mL EDTA, one 7.5-
mL serum (tiger top) tube, and one-8.5mL serum tubes will be collected. At the baseline visit and additional one 6-mL ACD (yellow t op) plasma vacutainer will be collected for ApoE genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. All tubes will be placed on 
ice and processed within 24 hours, including aliquoting for analysis . All tubes will be appropriately labeled with 
the study identification number, date (mm/dd/yyyy), and time (24-hour time, hh:mm).  Blood samples will be 
analyzed to assess biomarkers related to cardiometabolic health (including serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glucose metabolism, 
and inflammation), gut metabolites (short chain fatty acids) and neuronal health (including assessment of 
underlying ApoE genetics). Samples will be sent to Quest Diagnostics for cardiometabolic markers (standard lipid panel (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL -C (calculated), Cholesterol/HDL ratio (calculated), and 
non-HDL -C (calculated)), hemoglobin A1C, plasma glucose, serum  insulin, and high sensitivity - C-reactive 
protein). All other samples will be stored at −80°C for analysis. Batched samples will be analyzed at KUMC 
according to the protocols of the manufacturer using the following formats:, SIMOA (neurofilament-light and 
inflammatory cytokines), and polymerase chain reaction (A poE genotype). Unused samples will be banked for 
future evaluations  related to nutrition and brain healthincluding free cell RNA analysis at KUMC.  
 
C7l) Actigraphy: Maternal physical activity and sleep will be monitored using the ActiGraph wG3TX -BT. The 
device will be worn at the wrist for 7 days around  5/6 study visits ( baseline, end of intervention, 2 months, 6 
months, and 12 months postpartum). Participants will not be able to view any device data. Participants will also be asked to keep a sleep and activity log during this time. Participants will be mailed the device and given 
instructions for use prior to each study visit, along with an activity  and sleep tracker. Following the 7-day 
monitoring period, participants will return the device and log back to the study team. Data collected from the 
device are available at https://www.actigraphcorp.com/actigraph-wgt3x -bt/ and include raw acceleration, steps, 
METs, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and others related to activity and sleep. Participants will download an 
application on a home device that will allow them to daily sync the activity information via Bluetooth and send it to the cloud- based data management platform https://actigraphcorp.com/centrepoint/. 
C7m) Maternal vitals :  Blood pressure & heart rate will be assessed 6 times throughout the study (baseline, 
end of intervention, 2 weeks 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months) using the Omron HEM 907XL IntelliSense Professional Digital Blood Pressure Monitor. Participants will be instructed to sit quietly for 5 minutes in the 
upright position with feet flat on the floor. After completing the period, blood pressure cuff will be placed around 
10 
  the upper arm  and assessment completed per manufacturer’s recommendations. The measurement will be 
repeated until 2 are within 5 mmhg agreement.  
C7n) Veggie meter: Maternal carotenoid skin content will be assessed at 5 time points (baseline, end of 
intervention,  2 months, 6 months, and 12 months) using the veggie meter. Participants will insert a finger into 
the machine. The machine uses LED light to detect pi[INVESTIGATOR_165639]. Three measurements will be taken and 
averaged, each lasting 10-45 seconds.  
C7o) M aternal cognitive testing: The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery will be used to assess cognitive function in 
several different domains, including executive function, language, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], processing speed, and 
attention 5 times throughout the study (baseline, end of intervention, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months) .   
The test will be administrated by a trained team member on an Apple iPad. Consistent with the toolbox 
recomm endations, collected data will be emailed to a member of the study team and archived on the P -Drive. 
The record is not required to be kept on the iPad and can be expunged after confirmation that it has been archived on the P -Drive . 
C7p) Maternal olfactory testing: P
 articipant olfaction will be evaluated at 4 times throughout the study 
(baseline, end of intervention, 2 months, and 12 months). Each patient will be tested with fourteen different scents using aromatherapy inhaling scents  (rose, eucalyptus, clove, lemon, garlic, coffee, spearmint, orange, 
cinnamon, lavender, rosemary, anise, peppermint, and ginger). The scents will be available at two concentrations (1x and 2x), and the participants will be asked to nasally inhale each scent for 10 seconds. The 
participants will be presented with the 1x sticks and asked to state if a smell is present and to correctly identify the odor. If an odor is not detected or correctly identified, the 2x concentration of the same odor will be added to the remaining lot of inhalant sticks.   
C7q) Infant s
 kinfolds: Skinfolds will be assessed 4 timepoints for the infant (2 weeks, 2 months,  6 months, and 
12 months). Six skinfolds will be measured to represent AT distribution in order to compare to larger trials that do not have DXA. All measurements will be collected using standardized procedures to our laboratory. All 
skinfolds will be identified using anatomical landmarks and taken on the right side of the body using Lange 
calipers (Beta Technology, Santa Cruz, CA). Skinfolds will be taken in order from head to toe and then repeated in that same order. If two skinfold measurements differ by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_1149156], along the natural cleavage of the skin. The thigh skinfold will be 
measured at the mid-point between patella (knee cap) and inguinal crease at the anterior surface of the thigh. 
Flank skinfold will be measured immediately above the iliac crest at the mid-axillary line . Central FM will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_574810], suprailiac and flank skinfolds and dividing by [CONTACT_828194], biceps and triceps skinfolds and dividing by [CONTACT_14774].  
 
C7r) Maternal urine & pregnancy test: Urine will be collected at all [ADDRESS_1149157]-partum visits (2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months), the urine will be used to perform a pregnancy test. Urine will be collected and aliquoted into 10, 2-mL cryovials and stored at -80°C. Urine will 
be used to test for polyfluoroalkyl substances. Unused samples will be banked for future evaluations related to 
nutrition and brain health at KUMC. 
C7t) B
reastmilk analysis: Participants who choose to breast feed will be asked to pump one breast until empty, 
homogenize the breastmilk by [CONTACT_828195], and return 20-mL to the study team for nutrient analysis. Participants 
will be asked to do this at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, and 6 months, freeze it, and 
return it to the study team at the 2-month and 6-month visits. The remainder of the breastmilk collected can be 
kept by [CONTACT_828196]. Any leftover sample after initial nutrient analysis will be banked 
for future evaluations related to nutrition and brain health and KUMC.  
11 
  C8) Steps to maximize adherence and retention: We will be using incentives for study visits, incentives for 
reporting goals, and regular short-term performance and feedback.  
 
C8a) Incentive system : Participants will be compensated $10 0 for each of the 6 study visits: baseline, end 
intervention, 2 weeks postpartum , 2 months postpartum, 6 months postpartum, and 12 months postpartum 
totaling up to $6 00 for completion of all visits. Participants asked to return for repeat infant DXA (no more than 
2 at each study timepoint) will be compensated an additional $50. Compensation will be provided on a 
ClinCard, which is given at enrollment. After each visit study staff will load their unique card number with the 
respective pay. Participants can use the card anywhere Mastercard is accepted, and study staff does not have 
access to where the money will be spent.  
 
C8c) Monitoring retention: When participants miss a session or reporting of behaviors, they will be contact[CONTACT_828197] a standardized protocol according to attendance and adherence demands will be used to make every 
effort to retain the participant or encourage reporting. This will be documented and used for program 
evaluation.  
 
C9) Statistical analysis:  The purpose of this study is to attain feasibility data therefore the small sample size 
does not afford the power to detect significance but to identify promising trends and relationships.  
 
 Analysis for Aim 1 H1 : A t-test will be used to d etermine if there is a difference in maternal weight gain and fat 
accretion between the two groups. 
 
Analysis for Aim 2 H2:  A t-test will be used to quantify  if there is a difference in fiber intake and dietary quality 
between the two groups.  
 
Analysis for secondary Aim 1 H1: Repeated measures ANCOVA  will be used to assess the difference in gut 
microbiome composition  and diversity  from baseline to study end between groups.  
 
Analysis for secondary Aim 2 H2: A t-test will be used to determine if there is a difference in infant fat accrual 
between groups.  
 
Analysis for secondary Aim 3 H3: A t-test will be used to determine if there is a difference in metabolic, 
inflammatory, and brain health markers.  
 
Process evaluation: A process evaluation will be completed.  
 
C10) Study challenges:  A primary study challenge is the recruitment and retention. [CONTACT_574843] has completed 
protocols successfully recruiting participants from the OB clinics at KUMC. [CONTACT_220723], KUMC head of OBGYN, reports [ADDRESS_1149158] at KUMC with ~40% overweight. A second challenge is to assure the fidelity of the interventions. [CONTACT_765870] will listen to 20% of GBPC sessions and compare the content 
delivered to a standardized checklist. If less than 80% of content is covered, [CONTACT_765870] will re-train the Dietitian. 
A third challenge is to ensure subjects are attending sessions and reporting behaviors. We had a high degree 
of weekly reporting in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_828170] a similar response rate in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].  
 
C11) Expected results: We anticipate the Hfib  intervention will successfully prevent excessive GWG. The Hfib  
intervention holds promise to be delivered in routine clinical care. If the results are positive, the next study 
would be to adapt and embed the Hfib  intervention in routine clinical care. The literature supports preventing 
excessive GWG has a high likelihood to greatly improve the health of both mothers and their offspring however 
there is variable success in published interventions. This supports the need to design and test interventions informed by [CONTACT_828198].  
 
C12) Environment: The environment at KUMC is well suited to conduct this research.

  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
This study will enroll pregnant women and their offspring. This study will block randomize 6-10 women into one 
of the following groups: a high fiber dietary interve ntion or UC. The primary aim is to assess the difference in 
maternal weight gain and fat accrual. All subjects will be given a body weight scale and report weekly their 
body weight. This allows close supervision of progression of each participant to ensure the intervention is not 
overly effective and all women are gaining adequate body weight. If a woman gains or loses more than [ADDRESS_1149160]. 
Infant body weight and body composition will be measured at 2 weeks , 2 months , 6 months, and 12 months  
using the Pea Pod. An infant DXA scan will be obtained at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. 
 
RISKS TO HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design 
(1) Patient recruitment and informed consent. All recruitment, consent, and data forms for the study 
proposal  will be approved prior to any enrollment. Informed consent for continued testing is obtained by 
a trained research team member with NIH -approved Human Subjects’ protection certification. Consent 
includes  the standard elements: a study description, the potential risks, benefits and options for 
nonparticipation. All subjects are informed they are free to withdraw from the study without changes in 
their usual care. Consent is documented as a signed form and will be kept in a locked file at the study  
office. The study is conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of  
Helsi nki. The IRB review includes a review of all appropriate study documentation to safeguard the 
rights, safety and well -being of the subjects. The protocol, informed consent, written information given 
to the subjects, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents  are 
provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_54852]. The method of obtaining and documenting the 
informed consent and the contents of the consent will  occur either in person or online and comply with 
GCP and all applicable  regulatory requirement(s). 
(2) Describe the characteristics of the subject populations and identify criteria for inclusion and exclusion. 
Subjects will consist of pregnant women and their infants. Pregnant women will be consented for their  
participation and the participation of their infant in the study. Women will be between the ages 18- 45 
years  old; all racial/ethnic groups will be recruited between 9-1 9 weeks pregnant; can be first or greater  
pregnancy; BMI range: 18.5-45 kg/m
2. If they are consuming 25 g/day of fiber  or more , they will be 
excluded from the study. Women who do not have internet and phone access will be excluded from the study. Participants must be willing to consume provided snacks. Participants will also be excluded if 
they have history of gestational diabetes (GDM), diabetes, pre-eclampsia, hypertension, heart disease, 
hypothyroidism, or other metabolic abnormalities, current hyperemesis gravidarum, eating disorder, smok ing, or are pregnant with multiples. Deviations from  inclusion criteria will be at the discretion of the 
PI. Women that develop any of these medical conditions during pregnancy will be accounted for in the 
final analysis . This will be conducted at the University of Kansas Medical Center. We will recruit 5 6 
pregnant women who are between 9-1 9 weeks in gestation. These women will be patients from the 
University of Kansas OBGYN clinic. The race/ethnic breakdown of participants will be 12.5% Hispanic, 
30% Black, 40% White, 12.5% Asian and 5% classified as other. Following randomization and baseline 
testing, the intervention will begin and follow up measures will be acquired during pregnancy for 
outcome measures.  
(3) Identify the sources of research material to be obtained from subjects. In addition to data collected 
directly from participants  infant birth characteristics (e.g., sex, gestational age at birth, birth weight, birth 
length, etc.)  and health information up to [ADDRESS_1149161]. Hull’s locked research 
laboratory. Only study  personnel and [CONTACT_574843] have keys to access this area. Electronic data will be kept 
[ADDRESS_1149162]. Hull's laboratory on the shared drive. Only personnel 
approved by [CONTACT_828200]. 
(4) Describe all potential risks. No appreciable risk of physical, psychological, social, legal or other harm is  
expected. Blood will need to be drawn and may be associated with pain and the usual risks of blood 
letting. We are investigating between groups if differences are found for metabolic changes that occur 
during pregnancy. Many of the metabolic parameters we are exploring must be investigated in a fasted 
state or this would introduce error in the metabolic parameter (insulin, glucose, lipid panel, HbA1C, 
inflammatory markers). Measures will be collected at the CTSU Rainbow location and follow all safety 
protocols to ensure participant safety. In past protocols, w e collect a fasting blood draw and took  every 
precaution so that no harm comes to the mother or her baby. Women are instructed on the days 
leading up to their blood draw to drink plenty of water and to eat dinner and an evening snack if they 
are hungry the night before the blood draw. Appointments are scheduled first thing in the morning and we provide food and juice so that mothers eat immediately following the blood draw. We recorded no 
adverse events  following this protocol . We have had no adverse events. All protocols are IRB approved 
and have undergone heavy scruti ny due to the special population we are working with.  The DXA does 
emit radiation. In the moms, In the infants, three total body DXA scans will be completed over [ADDRESS_1149163] x -ray is equal to 0.1 
mSV or 10 days of exposure to natural background radiation. Over the course of 12 months, the total 
radiation exposure will be under a day of background radiation exposure. This is minimal especially 
considered it is spread over 12 months.   
(5) Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks. N/A. There are no known risks.  
(6) Discuss why the risks are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. N/A. No known risks.  
(7) Plan for monitoring and reporting problems . Adverse events will be assessed every 4 weeks during the 
dietary recalls during the 18-week intervention in the high-fiber group only . Baseline measurements will 
not be assessed for adverse events. Only a dverse events related to gaining or losing too much weight 
or allergic reactions to the study food will be recorded. Research staff will immediately report any 
adverse events to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_96294]. The study physician will review maternal and infant abnormal 
findings . If recommended by [CONTACT_5989], abnormal findings will be communicated to the 
participant’s physicians or infant’s pediatrician.   
(8) Plan for handling study withdrawal/discontinuation. Participants may discontinue study participation at any time in the study. Participants will be asked to sign a withdrawal consent. If participant does not 
sign a withdrawal consent, only data collected prior to withdrawal will be us ed.  
 
Adequacy of Protection Against Risks 
Describe plans for the recruitment of subjects and the consent procedures to be followed. Recruitment will be 
open to all pregnant women that meet the study inclusion criteria. The KUMC IRB will review and approve this  
study prior to implementation. Recruitment will only be performed under the supervision of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_828172]. Personnel will identify subjects 
who might be eligible by [CONTACT_828201] O2. Only medical information related to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be looked at. If determined eligible, research personnel will visit the patient at 
their scheduled clinic visit. OBGYN clinic staff will introduce study to potential subjects. Research personnel 
will discuss the study in detail  and determine final eligibility . Participants missed at their OBGYN visit will be 
contact[CONTACT_65312]. If participants are interested, they will be followed up with via phone or email to determine 
enrollment and complete the informed consent. Informed consent will be obtained via phone or in person at the 
first study visit.  
The women will be informed that the purpose of the study is to determine if a high fiber diet can help 
them gain the right amount of weight during pregnancy and that they will be placed in an intervention or control 
group. They will be told that if they participate in the study, regardless of their group assignment, that they will 
need to be seen two times during their pregnancy and four times after pregnancy. Further, they will be told if 
they are randomized to the intervention group they will be required to attend weekly video calls and  report 
goals weekly to the study coordinator for 18 weeks.  
 
20 
  Consent forms and HIPPA disclosure information per IRBs will be given to all subjects and their signatures  
witnessed. The consent forms will include a description of the study, nature of the data collection, the potential  
benefits and adverse reactions anticipated. Women will be assigned to group by [CONTACT_828202]. The subjects will be told that their usual care would not be changed, 
withdrawn, or reduced if they chose to withdraw from the study at any time. The research team personnel will  
abide by [CONTACT_574829], as well as the Privacy Protection for Research  
Subjects. All research staff will remain current in their NIH required Human Subjects protection and HIPAA  
certification.  
 
Case Report Forms on all women will include medical information pertinent to the study (e.g., smoking history, 
blood pressure, pregnancy history, age, race, etc.) in addition to the information directly related to the study  
(e.g., height, pre-pregnancy and clinic weights, blood pressure, EDD by [CONTACT_828203], etc.). To maintain 
patient privacy, all case report forms, study reports and communications will identify the patient by [CONTACT_828204]. The medical record and originals of outcome data will be the source documents  
for the study. Any changes to the case report forms necessitated because they at are odds with source 
documents will be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_144223]; and all Case Report Forms will be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_107310]. Data monitors and auditors from the IRBs, and regulatory authorities will  
have acces s to the patient’s original medical records for verification of data gathered on the case report forms  
and to audit the data collection process. Subjects will be made aware of persons who may see their protected  
health information in the informed consent document and may choose not to enroll in the study based on the information provided them in accord with 2003 HIPAA regulations. The patient’s confidentiality will be 
maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_6988].  
 
Data monitors and auditors from the IRBs, and regulatory authorities will have access to the patient’s original  
medical records for verification of data gathered on the case report forms and to audit the data collection  
process. S ubjects will be made aware of persons who may see their protected health information in the  
informed consent document and may choose not to enroll in the study based on the information provided them  
in accord with 2003 HIPAA regulations. The patient’s conf identiality will be maintained and will not be made 
publicly available to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_4913].  
 
The investigators will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol given approval by [CONTACT_380859]. Any  
changes to the protocol will require written approval from these committees prior to implementation, except  
when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients or if the change(s) involves  
only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. Any departures from the protocol will be fully documented in 
the case report form and source documentation. IRB review occurs each year and newly dates consent forms  
are issued. The Research Assistant will keep the study binder that includes all comm unication with the IRB and 
CVs for all study personnel, and study personnel approved roles. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring that  
the study binders are in order will fall to the PI (Hull).  
 Patient recruitment and informed consent. All recruitment, consent and data forms for the study proposal  
will be submitted to the KUMC IRB prior to enrollment using templates and educational materials formatted as  
previously IRB -approved in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_828205] -approved Human Subjects’ protection certification. Consent includes the  
standard elements: a study description, the potential risks, benefits and options for non-participation. All  
participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study without changes in their usual care. Consent will be documented as a signed form and will be kept in a locked file at the study office. The study will  
be conducted in accordance wi th ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki. The IRB will review  
all appropriate study documentation to safeguard the rights, safety and well -being of the subjects. The 
protocol, informed consent, written information given to the subjects, safety updates, annual progress reports,  
and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRBs by [CONTACT_093]. The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent will comply with GCP and all  
appli cable regulatory requirement(s). 
 
21 
  Study personnel will identify subjects who might be eligible under a waiver issued by [CONTACT_828206]/exclusion criteria for the study. No personal health information will be 
recorded until consent for the study is obtained in writing. 
 Protection against risk. Although no appreciable risk of physical or mental harm is expected to result from  
the protocol, procedures for dealing with adverse effects are established. Subjects will be instructed to report immediately to the study coordinator if any health problem occurs and to call the PI (Hull) at any time if they  
have questions are concerns. In such an event, it is the PI [INVESTIGATOR_828173].  
Subjects who choose to withdraw from the study will be reassured if they indicate the desire to withdraw.  Subjects will be protected against the risk of breaking confidentiality by [CONTACT_574835].  
Each participant will be assigned a numerical study ID and informed consent forms that include the subject’s  
signature [CONTACT_574840]. For ensuring confidentiality, these are generally  
acknowledged to be the best methods known for ensuring that names are not associated with data. Only  
selected research staff will have access to the subjects’ data. Subjects’ informed consent includes the HIPAA  
compliance documentation approved by [CONTACT_380859]. Research team personnel will abide by [CONTACT_828207]. 
 
Potential Benefits of Proposed Research Describe all potential benefits. There are no direct benefits for participation in the study outside of contributing  
to the knowledge and formulation towards interventions that are successful at helpi[INVESTIGATOR_828174]. This study could contribute to ways to improve maternal and infant health outcomes of pregnant women by [CONTACT_828208].  
 Importance of Knowledge to be Gained We are targeting recruitment of pregnant women who have a pre-pregnancy BMI 18.5 – 45.0 kg/m
2. We are 
specifically targeting women at high risk of excessive GWG during pregnancy. Data show 56% of women gain  
excessively 3,4. Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with poor outcomes. Based on our data, 
we anticipate the following distribution among the 3 pre-pregnancy weight categories selected (BMI <24.9 = 40%; BMI 25-25.9 = 34%; BMI >30 = 26%). Due to the adverse health that is related to excessive GWG, it is  
imperative to seek interventions to prevent excessive GWG.

 INCLUSION OF WOMEN, MINORITIES, AND CHILDREN  
 
Inclusion of Women: We are targeting pregnant women who have a pre- pregnancy BMI 18.5 – 45.0 kg/m 2. We 
are specifically targeting women at high risk of excessive GWG during pregnancy and at high risk of retaining a significant amount of body weight postpartum. Data show 56% of women gain excessively
3,4 and that 
excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with poor outcomes. 
 
Inclusion of Minorities: We are including all racial/ethnic groups in this study. There will be no exclusion criteria 
based on race or ethnicity.

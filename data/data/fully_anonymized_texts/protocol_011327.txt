2 Study Objectives  
To assess the efficacy of salicylic acid peels  every two weeks  in combination with 4% 
hydroquinone versus 4% hydroquinone alone in the treatment of melasma in Hispanic women.  
This study wi ll take  place over 14 weeks in  which time all patients will use 4% hydro quinone 
cream to the affected areas twice daily , but half the face will receive four salicylic  acid peels 
every two weeks.  End points include change in pi[INVESTIGATOR_589754] a mexameter and sub jectively by [CONTACT_589762], the melasma severity assessment, and the physician and patient global evaluation.  
 3 Background   
Melasma is a common disorder of hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_589755], forehead, 
and upper lip.  It manifests as tan -brown macules/patches slowly enlarging on the face.   It 
can affect all racial types but predominately affects women of skin types IV -VI especially 
those living in areas of intense UV radi ation  (1).    
The exact etiology of melasma is unknown, but it is thought to be multifactorial.  
Known triggers/exacerbators include pregnancy, hormone therapy, and sunlight.  Melasma 
can be very difficult to treat and often frustrating for the patient and  physi cian.  A recent 
study  has shown in Hispanic women that melasma significantly affects quality of life in both 
personal and professional aspects (2).       
Conventional treatments thus far include elimination of causative factors and a 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_589756] a gent, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 4% hydroquinone either alone or in combination with a 
October 6, 2006  3 retinoid, topi[INVESTIGATOR_589757].  In addition, patients are advised to use 
a sunscreen and take other sun protective measures (1).   
  Patients with melasma may significantly benefit from the addition of biweekly 
salicylic acid peels to 4% hydroquinone cream. A  previous , uncontrolled study showed that 
salicylic acid peels of 20% to 30% at two week intervals in patients with skin types V -VI 
resulted in moderate- significant improvement in melasma in 4 of 6 patients with melasma (3) . 
Although hydroquinone is the standard of care for melasma, no controlled trials have been 
performed comparing the efficacy of salicylic  acid peels in combination with 4% 
hydroquinone versu s hydroquinone alone.   
4 Agents  
The two agents used in this study will be salicylic acid 20 -30% peels and 4% 
hydroquinone cream, both of which are FDA approved for melasma.   
 The 4% hydroquinone cream will be purchased as a generic cream formulation .  Patients 
will apply this cream twice a day to affected areas on both sides of the face.  Contraindications to 
the use of 4% hydroquinone include pregnancy, plans for pregnancy, or breast feeding (in all cases patients will be excluded from our study).  Side effects can include irritation, redness, 
pruritus, and hypo/hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371].  One study comparing the use of 4% hydroquinone with placebo found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of incidence of side 
effects (4).  
 The salicylic aci d peels will also be purchased from a medical supply company in both 
20% and 30%  concentrations.  Patients will receive [ADDRESS_776907] 
two peels will be 20% and the last two peels will be 3 0%.  Side effects may  include redness, 
irritation, pruritus, skin peeling, and hypo/hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371].  One study looked at the safety and efficacy of salicylic acid peels in darker racial -ethnic groups and found the above mild side 
effects to occur in ~16%, all of which were transient , reso lving in less than two weeks  (3).   
 
5 Eligibility Criteria  
 
Consenting Hispanic women with bilateral moderate -severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_589758].  This study will be limited to only Hispanic women due to the high frequency of m elasma in this population and in order to study a uniform population.  Spanish 
October 6, 2006  4 speaking patients will be eligible for this study and a Spanish consent/HIPAA forms will be 
provided to them.  In addition, someone who speaks Spanish will always be available t o answer 
questions.  Key exclusion criteria include pregnancy, breastfeeding an infant, use of 4% 
hydroquinone cream within three months of the study, and history of chemical peels, microdermabrasion, or facial laser treatment within 9 months of the study.    
 
6 Material and data to be accessioned  
 Thirty  adult Hispanic women with moderate to severe melasma, diagnosed by [CONTACT_589763], will be recruited to participate in this  study.  Accounting for ~ 10 screening failure, we 
hope 20 patients will be abl e to complete this  14 week prospec tive investigator blinded, split -face 
trial of  biweekly salicylic acid peels in combination with 4% hydroquinone versus 4% 
hydroquinone alone .   
 At the initial visit, patients will be asked for their past medical history,  current 
medications, and will undergo a urine pregnancy test.   Once it is determined that patients are 
eligible for the study, they will be asked to give informed written consent  and sign a HIPAA 
authorization.  Next they will unde rgo evaluation of their  melasma by [CONTACT_589764] (an 
electronic device which painlessly measures skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] , 0-white, 1000- black , by [CONTACT_1299] a 
probe on the skin) compared to nea rby [CONTACT_37266].  In addition, a MASI score will be calculated 
(a subjective score based on darkness, area of involvement, and homogeneity o f the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517]).  A 
melasma severity assessment will also be performed by [CONTACT_589765]: [ADDRESS_776908] and polarized  photographs  (a specialized 
photograph that enhances the appearance of hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371])  will also be taken.  P atients will  
then undergo  a 20% salicylic acid peel to half the face (side to be peeled will be determined by a 
computer generated randomization code).  In addition they will be given 4% hydroquinone to use 
on the affected areas twice a day  (X 14 weeks)  and a cleanser and sunscreen to be used daily .  No 
other medications for melasma will be allowed during the study period.  
 At wee k 2, patients wil l undergo another  20% salicylic  acid peel to half the face .  They 
will be asked to report any adverse events from the salicylic acid peels or the hydroquinone.   
Prior to the peel a mexameter reading will be taken and the MASI score calculated  for each side 
of the face.  
October 6, 2006  5  At week 4 and 6 patients will undergo 30% salicylic acid peels and be asked to report any 
adverse events.  In addition, the study investigator will take mexameter readings from the 
peeled/unpeeled sides and calculate a MASI score on both the peeled/unpeeled sides at week 4 (investigator will be blinded as to which side was peeled).  At weeks 8 and 14, patients will report any adverse events and the study investigator will take mexameter readings and calculate a MASI 
score as above.   The physician will also perform a melasma severity assessment for each side of 
the face at weeks 8 and 14.  In addition, at 8 and 14 weeks, both the physician and patient will 
perform a subjective global evaluation of which side, if any , had more improvement in the 
following terms: no change/slight /moderate/marked.  
Visit Schedule and Assessments   
 
 7 Treatments  
Investigational Therapy and Reference Therapy  
Investigational Agent  – salicylic acid p eels (20 -30%) applied every two weeks for a total of four 
peels  
Reference Therapy – hydroq uinone 4% cream applied BID X 14 weeks.  
Treatment Assignment, Blinding , and Randomization 
Patients will all be  given 4% hydroquinone to use on the affected areas for 14 weeks.  In 
addition, each patient will receive biweekly salicylic acid peels to half of the face for a total of 
four peels  (at week 0, 2, 4, 6) .  The first two peels will be 20% salicylic acid and the last two 
peels will be 30% salicylic acid.  The sid e to be peeled will be determined by a computer 
generated randomization code.  Only the investigators will be blinded in the study, due to the Visit Number  1 2 3 4 5 6

No concomitant therapy will be allowed for the duration of the study.  Patients who were 
already on an oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_589759], but oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_589760]. 
Interruption or Discontinuation of Treatment  
Every patient has the right to discontinue study participation at any time, and every 
patient may be discontinued from the study for any reason beneficial to his/her well  being. All 
data generated up to the time  of discontinuation from the study will be analyzed and the reason(s) 
for discontinuation will be recorded.  
Treatment Compliance  
Patients will be asked to return all unused medication at the end of the study and the 
quantity of returne d medication will be  documented.  
[ADDRESS_776909] and polarized photographs will be taken at baseline 
and at week s 8 and  14.  A MASI score will also be calculated at baseline and at week s 2, 4, 8, and 
14.  A melasma severity assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_589766] 8 
and 14.  A physician and patient global assessment will be performed at week s 8 and 14, a 
subjective measure of which side, if any , improv ed more and to w hat degree (no 
change/slight /moderate/marked).   Primary efficacy assessment will be improvement of melasma 
using  mexameter reading s while secondary assessment will be improvement in MASI scores, 
melasma severity assessment,  and physician and patient  global  improvement compared with the 
opposite side.  
[ADDRESS_776910] of monitoring and recording all adverse events, including 
serious adverse events.   An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition 
occurring after starting the study drug (or therapy).  Medical conditions/diseases present before 
starting the study treatment are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the 
study treatmen t.  As this study only involves topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] , the most likely adverse events are 
October 6, 2006  7 minor and may include irritation, redness, burning, skin  peeling , and  hyper /hypo pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] .  
These adverse events will be specifically monitored for by [CONTACT_589767].  The  patient will be specifically q ueried upon each visit regarding adverse 
events from the salicylic acid peels and/or the 4% hydroquinone cream.  A patient has the right to discontinue participation in the study at any time .  The study investigator also has the right to 
discontinue the patient’s participation in the study should the patient’s condition worsen, they are 
unable to follow the treatment schedule, or the patient has unexpected side effects from the study 
medications.  
A serious adverse event is an  undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which: 1) 
is fatal or life -threatening, 2) requires or prolongs  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 3) results in persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, 4) constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect, or 5) is medically significant, in that it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
All adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator.  A ll unexpected or 
serious adverse  events will also be reported to the IRB.    
10 Registration and study monitoring  
Once patients are recruited into the study and complete their initial evaluation, they will 
be given a schedule of follow up visits.  As indicated in the schedule above, at e ach subsequent 
visit, they will be asked about adverse events, and they will be evaluated by a study investigator.  
All information will be recorded in the study report forms.  All adverse events will be reported to the principal investigato r, and all  unexpected or serious adverse events will also be reported to the 
IRB.    
11 Statistical Considerations    
Investigators will enter the information required by [CONTACT_589768] (SRFs).  Additionally, a series of standardized photographs will be tak en of  each patient at 
baseline and [ADDRESS_776911] to 
efficacy and safety observations. Data will be presented for the complete intent -to-treat 
population (all patients having taken at least one dose of study medication) as well as the per -
protocol population (all patients who completed the study without major protocol deviations).  
October 6, 2006  8 The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events, which 
includes all serious adverse events. Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_589769], having an 
adverse event in each body system , and having each individual adverse event. Any other 
information collected (e.g. severity or relatedness to study medication ) will be listed as 
appropriate.   
Efficacy will be primarily assessed by [CONTACT_589770] (affected 
skin-nearby [CONTACT_37266]) on the peeled versus unpeeled side.  This data will be analyzed using a 
two factor repeated measures analysis of variance.  Efficacy will be secondar ily assessed by 
[CONTACT_589771].  Another secondary measure of efficacy will be the melasma severity 
assessment of the peeled versus unpeeled side also using the repeated measures analysis of variance.    
 A McNemar chi -squared test will be used to determine if there is agreement between the 
Physician and Patient Global Assessment of Improvement at [ADDRESS_776912] satisfaction survey analyses will be 0.05.  
 A previous study has  shown that using 4% hydroquinone cream alone  results in total 
improvement in melasma in ~40% of patients  (4).  However , the assessments of melasma 
improvement were  more subjective than objective  in nature and differ from the end points we are 
using in our study .  Furthermore, it is unclear how much more improvement we may see with the 
addition of the salicylic acid peels.  Since we do not know how much improvement to expect 
given our efficacy endpoints, we will be performing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] r ecruiting ~20 patients.

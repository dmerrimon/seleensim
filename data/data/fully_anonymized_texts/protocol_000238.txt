**The day of first study drug administration = Day 1. All subsequent study Days are counted from this Day 1.
1Visit 1 and Visit 2 can be on the same day if required (see also footnote 8). Initiation of randomized treatment at Visit 2 can only begin if the patient meets the criteria for Initiation 
of Treatment (see Section 3.3.4 ).
2 Should a patient prematurely discontinue from the treatment, every effort should be made to keep the patient in the trial and c omplete all of the remaining study visits. If this is not 
possible, assessments at V9 (Wk1), V12 (Wk4), and EoS (V14 or V15 or V16 as applicable) should be completed or at a minimum an early EoS visit.
3 If a patient qualifies for rescue treatment with open label BI 655130 at either a scheduled or unscheduled visit from after Day  8 and up to and including Week 12, all 
procedures/measurements listed for V9 (with the exception of skin biopsy, Whole Blood for RNA sequencing, Soluble Protein Biomarkers in Serum and Whole Blood for Flow Cytometry) are to be performed prior to dosing and an IRT call is to be placed prior to dosing.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940440]-03 (14.0) / Saved on: [ADDRESS_940441] 20165Per physician’s assessment, Days 4 through 7 are optional if the patient has achieved complete pustular clearance (GPPGA pustul ation sub score = 0) at the prior visit.
6Informed consent will be signed at the screening visit (V1). For patients completing V1 and V2 > 6 weeks apart, it is recommend ed that the patient is asked to re-confirm (verbally) 
his/her consent to participate in the trial at Visit 2. 
7Infection testing includes tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV assessments (see Table 5.2.3: 1 ). EoS infection testing should only be done once at V14 or V15 or V16 as 
applicable.
8These procedures do not need to be repeated/performed when V1 and V2 are performed on the same day.
9IL36RN mutation status is to be obtained from the patient’s historical data if available.
10Vital signs: a) On non-study–drug administration days, vital sign assessments are to be done prior to blood sampling; b) On stu dy drug administration days, vital signs will be 
assessed at pre-dose, at approximately [ADDRESS_940442] be taken whether or not the patient has an elevated temperature a nd whether or not the patient takes anti-fever 
treatment. The fever assessments times are to be separated by [CONTACT_479271] 2 to 4 hours on dosing days. At all other visits (non- dosing days), fever will be assessed once a day and 
will be completed prior to receiving medication for fever treatment, if anti-fever treatment is given.
12Only applicable for women of childbearing potential. S – serum pregnancy test (performed at screening). U – urine pregnancy tests  will be performed on-site and only at study 
drug administration visits. Urine pregnancy testing should be done prior to study drug administration. Study drug should only be  administered in case of a negative test result. In 
case of a positive urine pregnancy test, a serum pregnancy (S) test will be done. 
13ECG measurements should always precede blood sampling and drug administration (including visits for rescue treatment).
14Safety laboratory tests include clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urinalysis, and will be performed centrally. Local Labs are to be used for dosing decisions prior 
to i.v. administration. Please refer to Section 5.2.3 for further details.
19These measurements are to be completed by [CONTACT_199085]/her own, without any help from or interpretation by [CONTACT_88360]. I f the patient is too sick to complete the 
questionnaires him/herself but is able to reply verbally, a member of the study team should read the instructions, questions, and response options aloud to the patient and collect the 
patient’s verbal response in as neutral and unbiased a manner as possible. If this is not possible either, the questionnaires ar e not to be completed. The order of completion for PROs 
is recommended to be as follows: PSS;  pain VAS; FACIT-Fatigue; 
20Local tolerability will be assessed during the study drug administration and for approximately 2 hours after the study drug adm inistration. 
21 After Wk1/D8 and through the follow-up period, should a patient who previously achieved a clinical response (GPPGA 0 or 1) to i nitial treatment (either BI655130 or placebo or 
escape medication) experience a recurrence of a GPP flare (see Table 3.1:1 ), treatment with a single i.v. dose of 900 mg BI 655130 is to be administered. After D8, only one rescue 
dose with BI 655130 is permitted if a patient experiences a recurrence of a GPP flare. Subsequent flares are to be treated with  escape treatment (SoC) per physician’s discretion.
22 Only applicable to patients who meet the qualification for treatment with Open Label (OL)  single i.v. dose of 900 mg BI 655130 at Wk1/D8 (see Table 3.1:1)
23Patients who achieved a clinical improvement to study treatment (not including escape treatment) and show no flare symptoms of moderate/severe intensity at V14 or V15 will be 
offered to enter into an open label extension (OLE) trial (1368-0025), if they have completed this study (EoS/V14 or V15) and meet the inclusion criteria for the OLE trial.
24Patients who receive rescue treatment with OL BI [ADDRESS_940443] V14. See also footnote 25. 
25Only for patients who receive rescue treatment with OL BI 655130 between Wk7 – Wk12. V15 is to be conducted 6 weeks (+/-7days) a fter rescue treatment with OL BI655130 
and includes a response evaluation. If at V15, the patient qualifies to enter OLE trial, then V15 will be considered as EoS. If  not, then the patient will have an additional [ADDRESS_940444] an EoS at V16.  p  19

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Clinical Presentation of Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPP):
GPP is a severe skin disease characterized b y the repeated occurrence of acute flares caused 
by [CONTACT_693510] (R15-1421 , R16 - 0933 ). The 
classic presentation of acute GPP was first described as a recurrent pustular form of psoriasis 
by [CONTACT_577067] 1909 (R16-0932) . While GPP and plaque psoriasis can occur at the 
same time in an individual patient ( R17-3403) , GPP is distinct from plaque psoriasis in 
clinical presentation, pathophy siology , histopathology , response to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], epi[INVESTIGATOR_577001].
The clinical presentation of GPP is quite different from psoriasis vulgaris (PV) in its’ 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_496574], often with normal appearing skin between very  acute and severe disease 
flares. GPP is clinically  characterized by  [CONTACT_693511] h silvery  scales representing the 
primary  lesion of typi[INVESTIGATOR_577002]. In addition, the histopathological hallmarks of GPP 
are distinct spongiform pustules of Kogoj located in the subcorneal portion of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. 
GPP may  be associated with sy stemic s ymptoms (fever, increased CRP and neutrophilia) and 
severe extra -cutaneous organ manifestations (liver, kidney  failure, CV shock). While patients 
with GPP may  have pre -existing or co- existing PV, it is possible to clinically  distinguish 
patients with primary  plaque disease (PV) who have a secondary  pustular component from 
patients who have primary pustular disease (GPP) with a concomitant plaque component, 
based on the sequence of manifestations (primary  lesion pustule rather than plaque) and the 
local ization of a GPP pustule on an ery thematous base rather than a PsO plaque.  
As descriptions for GPP are discordant among standard dermatology  textbooks (R17-3403), 
the European Rare And Severe Psoriasis Expert Network (ERASPEN) has defined consensus 
criteria that include as key  diagnosis criteria for acute GPP the presence of primary , sterile, 
macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_577000] -acral skin (excluding cases where pustulation is 
restricted to psoriatic plaques), with or without systemic inflammation, wi th or without 
plaque -type psoriasis, either relapsing (>1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) or persistent (>3 months).
Chronic GPP describes the state in between disease flares that may  be characterized b y the 
complete absence of s ymptoms or the persistence of residual skin s ymptoms such as 
erythema and scaling and minor pustulation.
Treatment options
Current treatment options for controlling acute flare of GPP and maintenance of response are 
limited and do not provide sustained efficacy  (R16-0933). N o treatments are currently  
approved for GPP in the US or centrall y approved for GPP in the EU, though retinoids, oral 
steroids, cy closporine or methotrexate are being recommended (R17-3600) . Although these 
treatments are describ ed to be effective in 70 – 84% of patients ( R17-3600 )these data 
observations are based on a retrospective cohort study  from Japan without clearl y defined 
Boehringer Ingelheim 26Jun 2020

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940465]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016endpoints ( R17-3626 ). Furthermore, these treatments cannot be used long-t erm due to side 
effects and contraindications (retinoids: teratogenicity , hair loss; cy closporine: excessive hair 
growth, renal toxicity ; MTX: liver toxicity ).
Secukinumab (Cosenty x®), infliximab (Remicade®) , ixekizumab (Taltz®), brodalumab 
(Lumicef®), adalimumab (Humira®)
,guselkumab (Tremfy a®)and Risankizumab are only  
registered in Japan for the treatment of GPP and plaque psoriasis. For secukinumab, 
authorization was granted on the basis of long- term treatment data (52 weeks) derived from a 
single op en label clinical trial conducted in 12 patients with chronic GPP and an endpoint at 
16 weeks ( R16-1462 ). Treatment trials supporting licensing in Japan have treated residual 
disease for an extended period of time, providing no evidence of how to appropriatel y treat 
acute GPP flares.  
Biologics (mostly  TNF inhibitors, occasionally  IL-1 or IL -17 inhibitors) are increasingly  used 
to treat more severe, extensive or treatment resistant patients with GPP, based on small 
published ca se series ( R17- 3603 ). However, these drugs are also associated with limitations 
in efficacy  (incomplete and delay ed responses are frequent) and safet y as well as 
contraindications (infusion reactions, tuberculosis, cardiovascula r disease). 
Unmet Medical Need 
Acute GPP flares of varying severity  occur in most patients and may  be idiopathic or 
triggered b y external stimuli, such as infection, corticosteroid use or withdrawal, non 
adherence and dose reduction of current standard of care treatment, stress or pregnancy  (R16-
0933 ). Moderate or severe GPP flares cause significant morbidity  and mortality  (R16-0933)
due to tender, painful skin lesions, extreme fatigue, high fever, peripheral blood neutrophil ia 
and acute phase response and sepsis. The acute phase is associated with a mean duration of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] 10 days (range 3 -44 day s) (R16-0933) . The observed mortality  rate of 7% 
reported in a retrospective study  (R16- 0933) with 102 GPP cases seen in a tertiary  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693491], Malaysia is likely  an underestimate as not all GPP patients were included in the study . 
Mortality  rates are also likely  underestimated due to lack of identify ing the cause of death as 
GPP and are largel y driven by [CONTACT_577070] -cutaneous organ 
manifestations such as renal, hepatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_577004] (R16-0933 ). After 
responding to treatment or spontaneous flare cessation, it is estimated that up to 50% of 
patients may  suffer from chronic GPP characterized by  [CONTACT_577071]. 
Moreover, in countries with lower incidence of GPP, the differential diagnosis can be 
delay ed.  This is partl y due to the absence of a treatment protocol for GPP once it is 
diagnosed.
Based on the limitations described above, current therapeutic options are not suitable for life -
long treatment and do not provide sustained responses in most patients. Therefore, there is a 
high need to develop (i) a highl y effective tre atment with rapid onset of action for patients 
presenting with an acute GPP flare; and (ii) to develop an effective treatment of chronic GPP, 
which reliabl y prevents the occurrence of flares and is safe and tolerable for lifelong 
treatment.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940466]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016Role of IL -36R Signaling in GPP
The classic presentation of GPP flares as described by  [CONTACT_577072] y correlated 
with poly morphisms in the IL36 -R signaling pathway  (R15- 1421, R14 -5158 ) . Individuals 
with loss-of- function mutations of the IL36RN gene which encodes an endogenous IL36R 
antagonist (IL -36RN) have dramatically  higher incidence of GPP, indicating that 
uncontrolled upregulation of IL36 signaling due to defective IL36RN antagonism leads to the 
inflammatory  epi[INVESTIGATOR_577005]. Genetic human studies have demonstrated the 
occurrence of GPP clusters in families with a loss of function mutation in IL36RN, which 
results in uncontrolled IL36R signaling (R14-5158) .  Mutations in other genes linked to the 
IL36 pathway  such as CARD14 ( R16-0929) also lead to GPP. A recently  published gene 
expression study  indicates sustained activation of IL -1 and IL -36 in GPP, inducing neutrophil 
chemokine expression, infiltration, and pustule formation, suggesting that the IL -1/ IL -36 
inflammatory  axis is a potent driver of disease pathology  in GPP (R17-3602) . Moreover, a 
recent meta -analy sis investigated 233 published GPP cases. They  found that 49 (21.0%) of 
233 ca ses carried recessive IL36RN alleles. Those 49 recessive IL36RN alleles defined a 
GPP phenoty pe characterized by  [CONTACT_577073] s ystemic inflammation (R16-
0930 ).
IL36R is a cell surface receptor involved in inflam matory  responses in skin and gut. It is a 
novel member of the IL1R family  that forms a heterodimeric complex with the IL1R 
accessory  protein. The heterodimeric IL36R s ystem with stimulating (IL36α, IL36β, IL36γ) 
and inhibitory  ligands (IL36Ra) shares a num ber of structural and functional similarities to 
other members of the IL1/IL1R family , such as IL1, IL18 and IL33 ( R17-3602 ). All IL1 
family  members (IL1α, IL1β, IL18, IL36α, IL36β, IL36γ, and IL38) signal through a unique, 
cogn ate receptor protein which, upon ligand binding, recruits the common IL1RacP subunit 
and activates NFkB and MAP kinase pathway s in receptor -positive cell t ypes. In human skin 
tissues, IL36R is expressed in keratinocy tes, dermal fibroblasts and infiltrating myeloid cells.  
IL36R activation in skin tissue drives the production of inflammatory  mediators (e.g. CCL20, 
MIP-1β, TNF -α, IL12, IL17, IL23, TGF -β) and modulates the expression of tissue 
remodeling genes (e.g. MMPs, TGF -β). Therefore, the link between GP P and mutations in 
the IL36RN is somewhat analogous to the well-established neonatal onset of sterile 
multifocal osteomy elitis, periostitis, and pustulosis caused b y absence of interleukin -1–
receptor antagonist. In this case, absence of the receptor antago nist allows unopposed action 
of interleukin -1, resulting in life -threatening s ystemic inflammation with skin and bone 
involvement ( R17- 3602) . These clinical features responded to empi[INVESTIGATOR_693492] -1–receptor antagonist an akinra (P09- [ZIP_CODE] ). 
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
1.2.1 Mode of action
BI 655130 is a humanized antagonistic monoclonal IgG1 antibod y that blocks human IL36R 
signaling. Binding of BI 655130 to IL36R is anticipated to prevent the subsequent activation 
of IL36R by  [CONTACT_190216] (IL36 α, β and γ) and downstream activation of p ro-
inflammatory  and pro- fibrotic pathway s with the aim to reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231]/ fibroblast/ 
immune cell -mediated inflammation and interrupt the inflammatory  response that drives

1.2.2 Nonclinical pharmacology
Preclinical Studies
BI 655130 binds to human IL36R with a binding avidity  of less than 1 pM. BI 655130 
inhibits IL36 ligand -stimulated NF -B activation in HT29 and transformed epi[INVESTIGATOR_637414]90 values in a 
consistent range of 0.7 to 3.7 nM. BI 655130 also inhibits IL8 release in primary  human 
intestinal my ofibroblasts and IFNγ secretion in human PBMC stimulated with IL36α, IL36β, 
or IL36γ combined with IL12. Mutations of two key  residues (L234 and L235) to alanine 
were made to BI [ADDRESS_940468] of the mutations in the IgG1 FcR binding sites on both antibod y
-dependent 
cellular cy totoxicity  (ADCC) and complement- dependent cy totoxicity  (CDC) effector 
functions revealed that the mutations abrogate both ADCC and CDC effector functions and 
indicate that BI [ADDRESS_940469] identification studies of the mode-of- action (MoA) of IL -36R inhibition 
were performed in mice using a mouse specific anti -IL-36R monoclonal antibody  (BI 
674304), which is a mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody  with rat va riable regions. In a 13 -
week intravenous toxicity stud y of BI 674304 in mice, no adverse effects of IL -36R 
antagonism were seen at a dose (50 mg/kg, twice weekl y) that was 5 fold higher than the dose 
that was protective in an experimental mouse colonic inf lammation model. In the 26 -week 
toxicity  study , male and female mice (20 -30/sex/group at 0, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day ) were 
administered BI 674304 twice weekl y for 26 weeks by [CONTACT_693512]. There were no BI 674304 -related changes in clinical observations, body  weights, food 
consumption, ophthalmology , clinical pathology  parameters (hematology , clinical chemistry ), 
organ weights, macroscopic or microscopic examinations. The no-observed-adverse- effect 
level (NOAE L) was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day . The in vitro cy tokine release and tissue 
cross -reactivity  assay s demonstrate that the risk of transient cy tokine release in humans is 
low and that, as expected, BI [ADDRESS_940470] -in-Human (FIH) study , BI 655130 or placebo (PBO) was admin istered to 78 
healthy  volunteers with 58 subjects assigned to single ascending i.v. doses from 0.001 mg/kg 
to 10 mg/kg bod y weight and 20 subjects assigned to placebo . Safet y and tolerability  of all 
tested i.v. doses was good. There were no SAEs. AEs categorized as related to treatment were 
observed in 3/20 (15.0%) subjects in the placebo group and in 8/58 (13.8%) subjects treated 
with BI 655130. The most frequent treatment- emergent AEs were nasophary ngitis (BI

illness (BI 655130: 6.9%; PBO: 10.0%), and diarrhea (BI 655130: 3.4%; PBO: 10.0%). There 
were two AEs of moderate intensity  (injection site haematoma, headache), all remaining AEs 
were of mild intensity . There were no s erious AEs, no AEs that led to discontinuation of trial 
drug, no protocol -specified AEs of special interest and no other significant AEs according to 
ICH E3.
No relevant changes were observed in safet y laboratory  tests, vital signs, and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs). Importantly, there were no relevant differences in frequencies of 
subjects with treatment emergent AEs between the treatment groups, and no dose -
dependency  was observed.
PK analy sis showed that exposure (AUC0- tz and Cmax ) to BI  655130 increased with 
increasing dose in an approximately  dose -proportional manner from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. The 
effective half -life of BI 655130 is approximately  4 weeks in the linear dose range. Overall, 
PK data so far suggests target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) kinetics for BI 655130. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected in 9 subjects ([ADDRESS_940472] on placebo), [ADDRESS_940473] target engagement (ITE) of IL36R by [CONTACT_35978] 
655130 using an ex -vivo whole blood stimulation assay  (c09985235 - 01).  The anal yses 
indicate for doses of 3 mg/kg and above, the percent inhibition of macrophage inflamma tory 
protein ( MIP)-1β was at least 94% as compared to baseline during the entire time course up 
to 1680 hrs (10 weeks).
In a multiple rising dose trial, BI [ADDRESS_940474] been administered to healthy  
volunteers at multiple ascending i.v. doses of 3, 6,10 and 20 mg/kg given weekl y for 4 weeks 
(i.e. 4 administrations) or a single dose of 20mg/kg (8 subjects each, 3:1 on active or PBO). 
Overall, multiple i.v. doses of 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, as well as single and multiple 
doses of 20 mg/kg BI 655130 were found to be safe and well tolerated by  [CONTACT_693513]. The incidence and intensity  of drug related AEs appeared to be higher in 
the 20 mg/kg multiple dose BI 655130 treatment group than in the other treatment groups, 
mainly driven by [CONTACT_12704]. No dose -dependent AEs or other clinicall y relevant changes in 
safet y laboratory  tests, vital signs, or ECG were observed. For further details refer to the 
current Investigator`s Brochure (IB ;c03320877 ).
The open- label, single group phase I study  trial (1368.11) was conducted to investigate the 
safet y, tolerabilit y, pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics, and efficacy of a single 
intravenous dose of BI 655130 (10 mg/kg) in 7 patients with acute flare of generalized 
pustular psoriasis. The proof-of-concept (PoC) for IL36R inhibition in GPP was achieved in 
these patients who showed rapid clinical responses to single administrations of BI 
655130. Five of these [ADDRESS_940475] clear of GPP 1 week after the 
infusion, and all of them reached this status 4 weeks after treatment. Within 48 hours of 
treatment, pustules were completely  cleared in 3 patients; pustules were cleared by  [CONTACT_90337] k 1 in 
5 patients, and by  [CONTACT_10585] 2 in 6 patients. The earl y response in the skin was also accompanied 
by [CONTACT_637445] y response in sy stemic components (C -Reactive Protein [CRP] approaching 
normalization within 4 weeks). A major improvement in GPPASI  was observed in all patients 
very early with a mean (SD) percent change from baseline of 73.2% (16.2) at Week 2; by

Additional improvements (mean [SD]) from baseline to Week 2 were observ ed in FACIT- F, 
12.3 (10.1); Pain -VAS, – 45.9 (32.3); and PSS, –5.14 (3.18), all of which were also sustained 
through Week 4. For further details and most recent results refer t o the current IB 
(c03320877) and published article in the New England
Journal of Medicine ( P19-[ZIP_CODE]) .
A placebo controlled Phase II stud y (1368 -0015) has also been conducted in 59 patients with 
palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), 38 of whom received infusions of BI 655130 at doses u pto 
900 mg every  4 weeks (0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) and were followed- up through week 32. Two
Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported (one patient each in the 300 mg BI 655130 and placebo
arm). While the majority  of AEs were mild or moderate and expected for the pop ulation, a
severe AE was reported in 2 patients for each of the three stud y arms (300 mg BI 655130,
900 mg BI 655130 and placebo). Four AEs (10.5%) in patients treated with BI 655130 and
three AEs (14.3%) in patients treated with placebo led to discontinua tion of trial medication.
Three patients in the [ADDRESS_940477] (AESI) were reported. No clinically  relevant
abnormalities with respect to safet y laboratory  and vital signs were observed.
While the proportion of patients who achieved ppPASI 50 at Week 16 in the total population
was similar in all treatment groups (6 of 19 in 900 mg BI 655130 arm, 6 of 19 in 300 mg BI
655130 arm, and 5 of 21 in placebo arm) the baseline disease severit y within the trial
population was lower than expected, with half of the patients having a baseline ppPASI  total
score ≤ 16.70. In patients with baseline disease scores > 16.7, post
-hoc subgroup anal yses
indicated efficacy  for both doses of B I 655130 relative to placebo .The mean percent 
reduction from baseline in ppPASI  total score was 40%, 24% and 8%, at week 16 for BI 
655130 900 mg, BI 655130 300 mg, and placebo respectivel y in this subgroup. The mean 
percent reduction from baseline in pustular severity  was 5 7%, 3 0% and 5% for the 900 mg BI 
655130, 300 mg BI 655130 and placebo groups respectively at week 16 of this subgroup
, 
indicating a dramatic reduction in pustule severity with evidence of a dose response

Summary
BI 655 130 is an anti -IL36R antibody  with a high clinical activity  to block IL36R signaling as 
demonstrated in patients with Generalized Pustular Psoriasis, a severe inflammatory  skin 
disease driven b y uncontrolled IL36 activit y. BI 655130 has been tested in healthy  volunteers 
who received multiple doses every  week for 4 weeks. These weekl y doses of 20 mg/kg i.v. 
were all found to be safe in the subjects treated. In addition, IL36R inhibition shows a 
favorable nonclinical safety  profile. BI  [ADDRESS_940478] -hoc anal ysis for both doses of BI 655130

Current treatment options for controlling acute flare of GPP, complete resolution of 
symptoms and prevention of reoccurrence of flares are limited and do not provide sustained 
efficacy  (R16- 0933 ). No treatments are currentl y app roved for GPP in the US or centrall y 
approved for GPP in the EU, though a combination of retinoids, cy closporine or methotrexate 
has been recommended as primary  options for controlling worsening of chronic GPP (R17-
3600 ). The us e of these for acute flare of GPP is based on anecdotal retrospective case 
reports, making this trial prospectivel y testing a treatment that has shown efficacy for acute 
flare more important to conduct. In addition, long- term use of these treatments is limited due 
to side effects and contraindications (retinoids: teratogenicity , hair loss; cy closporine: 
excessive hair growth, renal toxicity ; MTX: liver toxicity ). Side effects, such as hair loss, 
excessive hair growth and teratogenicit y particularly  limit th e use of these treatments in 
women. Biologics (mostly TNF inhibitors, occasionally  IL-1 or IL -17 inhibitors) are 
increasingl y used to treat more severe, extensive or treatment resistant patients with GPP, 
based on small published case series (R17-3603, R16- 2960) . However, these drugs are also 
associated with limitations in efficacy  (incomplete and delay ed responses are frequent) and 
safet y (risk of infections and infusion reactions). 
Based on the lim itations described above, current therapeutic options are not suitable for life -
long treatment and do not provide sustained responses in most patients. Therefore, to address 
the high unmet needs in GPP there is a critical need to develop (i) a highl y effec tive treatment 
with rapid onset of action for patients presenting with an acute GPP flare; and (ii) to develop 
an effective treatment that also reliably  reduces the occurrence of flares and leads to complete 
resolution of manifestations such as widespread erythema and scaling, and is safe and 
tolerable for lifelong treatment. I n addition, a search of the current literature did not y ield an y 
published studies focusing on moderate to severe GPP flares. Thus, our PoC approach 
(1368.11) and subsequent developme nt plan (1368 -0013) further address the need for GPP 
treatment options.
The strong genetic link between the IL36 signaling pathway  and GPP and experimental data 
identify ing IL -36 as the dominant cy tokine driving GPP ( R17-3602) suggest that inhibition of 
IL36R signaling with the humanized anti -IL36R antibody  BI [ADDRESS_940481] defenses (R17-3632 ).
Based on this rationale, an open -label, single arm study  trial (1368.11) has been conducted to 
investigate proof -of-concept of a single dose of BI [ADDRESS_940482] been treate d with a single IV administration of 10mg/kg of BI 655130. 
As described in Section 1.2.3 , inhibiting IL36R activity  results in a rapid and sustained 
improvement in GPP clinical skin and systemic s ymptoms. In study  1368.11, 7 patients were 
randomised into this open label, single dose, single arm trial of BI 655130. All patients 
received a single intravenous dose of 10mg/kg BI 655130. AEs reported within 20 weeks 
after administration of the trial medication were considered on -treatment.

In 1 patient ,an infusion-related reaction was reported. The patient felt “heat” after the 
infusion of the trial medication during Visit 3. This event was not accompanied by  [CONTACT_190218], in particular vital signs remained stable. This event was transient and did not

In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily  
donate biospecimens for banking (please see Section 5.4.3 ). If the patient agrees, bank ed 
samples may  be used for future biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g. to 
identify  patients that are more likely  to benefit from a treatment or experience an adverse 
event (AE), or to gain a mechanistic or genetic understanding of drug ef fects and thereby

Preclinical profiles of BI [ADDRESS_940488] (c03320877).
No relevant animal species is available for toxicology  testing of the highl y human specific 
antibody  BI 655130. However, preclinical toxicology  studies with a mouse surrogate 
antibody  have demonstrated the safet y of IL-36R inh ibition in mice (c03320877) .
As of September 2018, BI655130 has been given to [ADDRESS_940489] also been a small number of patients experiencing severe 
or serious adverse events in clinical trials. It is unknown whether these adverse events were 
caused by  [CONTACT_35978] 655130. Overall adverse events observed in subjects who received BI 655130 
were comparable to adverse events observed in those who received placebo and no dose -

hypersensitivity including (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for further details) infusion reactions at the 
site according to Instructions for Preparation and Handling of BI 655130.
Based on the findings in the nonclinical studies conducted to date and in accordance with 
international regulatory  guidelines, the inclusion of Women of Child Bearing Potential 
(WOCBP) in this study  is justified. To minimize the risk on unintentional exposure of an 
embry o or fetus to the investigational drug, WOCBP must agree to the requirements for the 
pregnancy  testing and cont raceptive methods described in the protocol. 
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  (DILI) is under constant surveillance 
by [CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this trial requires timely  detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations in selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure 
patients´safet y, see also Section 5.2.6.
Summary of benefit -risk assessment
The trial presents a benefit for the patient of monitoring until the next GPP flare as well as 
monitoring and careful management during and after the occurrence of that flare.  
Considering the medical need of the development of an effective and well tolerated drug for 
treating GPP flares, the benefit of this trial is considered to outweigh t he potential risks for 
and justifies the administration of BI 655130 to patients with Generalized Pustular Psoriasis 
(GPP) presenting with an acute flare of moderate to severe intensit y. Due to the lack of 
mechanism -or compound -related safety signals and the antagonistic mode of action of BI 
655130 it is considered likely  that GPP patients will not be exposed to undue risks.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, pla cebo -controlled Phase II stud y with one 
dose of BI 655130/placebo in patients with GPP presenting with an acute flare of moderate to 
severe intensit y. The primary objectives of this trial are to assess the efficacy, safet y and 
tolerability  of a single intr avenous (i.v.) dose of BI 655130 in comparison to placebo in 
patients with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) presenting with an acute flare of moderate 
to severe intensit y. 
Approximately  11 to 20 countries will participate by  [CONTACT_343669]/centers experienced in the 
management of GPP.
Fifty -one patients with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) presenting with an acute flare of 
moderate to severe intensity  are required to be randomized to receive BI 655130/ placebo 
(2:1) into this trial. 
Patients are considered enrolled (screened) in the study  once they  have signed the informed 
consent. 
Patients eligible to receive treatment after screening will be able to participate in this study  
and will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1(BI 655130/Placebo) to on e of two treatment groups 
as shown in Figure 3.1: [ADDRESS_940501] dose of stud y medication (900 mg 
i.v. BI 655130 or Placebo) on Day  1 of Week 1 (Randomization). Based on the subsequent 
treatment response p atients will then be followed for 12 to 28 weeks (see Flow Chart ). Study  
Week in the flow chart represents the end of each week (e.g. End of Wk1=D8, End of Wk2 
=D15, End of Wk3 = D22, End of Wk4 =D29 etc.).
During Week 1, D1, D2, D3 and D8 are mandatory  visits, however, D4 –D7 are optional 
visits and need not be attended if a patient has alread y achieved complete pustular clearance 
(GPPGA pustulation sub score =0) at the previous visit. 
At the discretion of the investigator, patients may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190211], during or following 
first study  drug administration. Thereafter, the decision to discharge a patient from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693493], based on the evolution of the GPP 
flare and t he patient’s health status.
If the severity  and progression of the disease worsens within the first week (Wk1/D2 -D7) 
(see Table 3.1:1 for definition of disease worsening), the investigator can treat the patient 
with a Standard o f Care (SoC) treatment of his/her choice (escape medication). If the disease 
condition is stable, it is recommended to wait until the primary  endpoint visit (Wk1/D8) 
before prescribing an escape medication (SoC) since there will be an option to administer OL 
BI [ADDRESS_940502] week, the 
patient will not be eligible to receive treatment with OL single i.v. dose of 900 mg of BI 
655130 on D8. For escape medication use during the trial after Wee k 1, please refer to Table 
3.1:1 .

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940503]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016At the Week 1/Day [ADDRESS_940504] a GPPGA ≥ 2 at Wk1 and a 
GPPGA pustulation subscore of  
≥2 will be eligible to receive treatment with a single open 
label i.v. dose of  BI 655130 900 mg. All randomized patients will continue through the 
subsequent visits until the End of Study  (EoS) as outlined in the Flow Chart . If patients 
receiving escape medication during Wk1 (D2- D7) are not willing to attend all subsequent 
visits then assessments at V9 (Wk1), V12 (Wk4) and EoS (V14 or V15 or V16 as applicable) 
should be encouraged or at the very  minimum an earl y EoS visit. 
After Wk1/D8 and through the follow -up period, if a patient who previously  achieved a 
clinical response (GPPGA 0 or 1), either with BI 655130 at D1 or placebo at D1 or escape 
medication or OL BI 655130 at D8, experiences a recurrence of a GPP flare (see Table 3.1: 1
for definition), a rescue treatment with a single i.v. dose of 900 mg BI 655130 is to be 
administered. This could occur at a scheduled or unscheduled visit any time between after D8 
and Week 12. After D8, only  one rescue dose with BI 655130 is permitted if a patient 
experiences a recurrence of a GPP flare. Subsequent flares are to be treated with escape 
treatment (SoC) per ph ysician’s discretion.  
Patients who achieved a clinical improvement to BI 655130 and who show no f lare 
symptoms of moderate/severe intensit y at V14 or V15 visit will be offered to enter into an 
open label extension (OLE) trial (1368 -0025), if they  have completed this study  (EoS/V14 or 
V15 visit, see below) and meet the eligibility  criteria for the OLE trial.
For patients who qualify  to enter OLE, prior to entering into the OLE trial:
Patients who do not require rescue treatment with OL  BI 655130 are to be followed 
until Week 12 (V14/EoS). 
Patients who receive rescue treatment with OL BI 655130 betwee n Wk2 -Wk6 are to 
be followed until Week 12 (V14/EoS). 
Patients who receive rescue treatment with OL BI 655130 between Wk 7 -Wk12 are to 
be followed for additional 6 weeks from administration of rescue treatment up to Wk 
13 –Wk18 (V15/EoS).
Patients who do not qualify  to enter into the open label extension (OLE) trial (1368 -0025), 
will be followed for 16 weeks (EoS/V16/Wk16-Wk28) after the last dose of trial medication, 
which is the latest timepoint of trial medication given during the study  (i.e. the latest of V2, 
V9 if OL BI 655130 is given, rescue with OL BI 655130 if given). 
Individual patient participation is concluded when the patient has completed the last planned 
visit.  The “last
-patient -last-visit-primary -endpoint” is the last sche duled primary  endpoint 
visit (Week 1/D8) completed b y the last patient.  The end of the trial is defined as “last 
patient out”, i.e. last scheduled visit (EoS) completed by  [CONTACT_148869].

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940514]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct20163.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DES IGN, INCLUDING THE C HOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
This phase II trial with BI [ADDRESS_940515] option that can be offered for failing placebo 
patients is BI 655130. In the 1368.13 trial, an y patients regardless of originally randomized 
treatment group, who experiences disease worsening and/or has recurrence of flare during the 
t
rial duration, will be offered escape treatment (SoC – physician’s choice) and/or rescue 
treatment with open label BI 655130. Refer to Section 3.1 for details regarding criteria for 
qualify ing for escape treatment with SoC or rescue treatment with OL BI 655130.
No active control group is included in this trial as there is currentl y no drug approved for the 
induction treatment of acute flares of moderate to severe GPP. Secukinumab (Cosenty x®), 
infliximab (Remicade®), ixekizumab (Taltz®), brodalumab
(Lumicef®), adalimumab (Humira®), guselkumab (Tremfy a®) and Risankizumab are only  
registered in Japan for the treatment of GPP and plaque psoriasis. For secukinumab , 
authorization was granted on the basis of long- term treatment data (52 weeks) derived from a 
single open label clinical trial conducted in 12 patients with chronic GPP and an endpoint at 
16 weeks (R16-1462 ). Moreover, due to the absence of approved drugs and a commonly  
accepted treatment algorithm, patients in this trial will have a very  heterogenous pre -
treatment history  as different SoC are available in different countries, which prevents the 
selection of suitable active comp arator which is relevant for all patients. Considering an add -
on design in treatment- naïve patients or patients with a defined treatment history  would make 
enrolment of this study  non-feasible. In addition, given the lack of a known effect size for 
SoC tre atments (e.g., biologics, retinoids, or cy closporine), because these drugs have not been 
tested in clinical trials in acute GPP, the expected sample size would of necessity  be much 
larger in an acute flare setting in order to account for potentially  smalle r treatment differences 
than might be observed in a comparable trial where placebo is used as the comparator.  This 
approach is not feasible in a rare disease such as GPP where recruitment is much slower and 
driven by  a population with very  few patients. 
Thus, study  1368-0013 will be a single- dose, placebo -controlled study  of patients with acute 
GPP flares of moderate to severe intensit y receiving 900 mg BI 655130 and then followed for 
an additional 12 weeks. Patients who satisfy  the inclusion/exclusion cr iteria of subsequent 
open -
label extension trial (1368-0025) will receive an option to continue receiving treatment 
for GPP with s.c. dosing. See Section 3.[ADDRESS_940516] been invited to participate in order to minimize the risk of under 
recruiting and to meet the goal of 51 patients entered. Recruitment will be ver y challenging

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940517]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016due to the rareness of the disease and because GPP patients must have an acute flare of 
moderate to severe intensity  in order to be randomized on the trial. 
For this trial, it is planned to include patients with active disease regardless of the mutation 
status (the status will be investigated during the trial) for the following reason:
Efficacy  has been seen in GPP patients both with and without the IL36RN mutation (earl y 
response to flare treatment with BI 655130 in 1368.11).
In addition to the described IL36RN mutation, other mutations in the same gene and other
genes linked to the IL36 pathway  have been described (please see Section 1.1 “Medical 
Background”).  This points to a general role of the IL36 pathway  as disease trigger/driver.
Because rapid treatment of flares is critical, patients can be included without the need for 
screening for mutation status.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) at the investigational site irrespective of 
whether they  have been treated with investigational drug or not.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
This study  will assess treatment of patients with GPP presenting with an acute fla re of 
moderate to severe intensity .

These diagnosis criteria include:
Primary , sterile, macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_577000]- acral skin (excluding cases where 
pustulation is restricted to psoriatic plaques)

4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial
A fixed rather than weight -based dose regimen of single dose of 900 mg has been selected for 
the following reasons: 
Early trials of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies often investigate bod y-weight –based 
regimens to reduce the inter
-subject variability  in drug exposure. However, there is 
generall y onl y a modest contribution of body weight to the overall pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and pharmacod ynamic (PD) variabilit y of monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, 
monoclonal antibodies are highl y target specific and offer a relatively  large therapeutic 
window compared to new chemical entities. Therefore, most monoclonal antibodies are 
approved at fixed doses in antibody /target excess in order to cover target turnover and 
maximize efficacy  (R10-6267, R13 - 4749 , R13-4753 , R13-4750 , R13-4754 ).
A dose of 10 mg/kg BI [ADDRESS_940532] trial in 
GPP (Proo f of concept trial 1368.11) on the basis of the SRD trial 1368.1 that tested 
doses up to 10 mg/kg, which were all found to be safe and tolerable in the patient 
populations studied. The dose of 10mg/kg was chosen for Study  1368.11 as it was 
considered to pr ovide greater assurance of achieving appropriate exposure levels in the 
skin and efficacy  in GPP patients.  I n Study  1368.11, no severe or serious adverse events 
were reported, this confirms that in the GPP patients enrolled (n=7), the selected dose of 
10mg/kg is safe and tolerable. 
Thus, based on these data from 1368.11, it was considered reasonable to continue with the 
dose of 10 mg/kg and to maintain the PK exposures observed in the trial 1368.11.  A fixed 
dose of 900 mg as a single IV infusion is recommended for flare treatment in the proposed 
trial (1368-0013) based on the evaluation of the PK data in GPP patients suggest that BI 
655130 exposure in patients was lower when compared to PK in Healthy  Volunteers (HVs) 
and based on flexibility  to recruit s ubjects with a body  weight greater than 70 kg.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940533]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016Tests in healthy  volunteers with doses up to 20 mg/kg (every  week for 4 weeks in trial 
1368.2) indicated that BI 655130 was found to be safe (see Section 1.2.3 and IB for further 
details (c03320877)). Thus, the selected fixed dose (900 mg i.v.) is within safet y limits for 
patients with a lower weight.
The intended dose for treatment of a moderate to severe flare which can be life -threatening is 
the maximum practical dose to deliver at one time. Experience with biologics has consistently  
led to concern about under-dosing leading to inadequate response.  In this trial those who 
have inadequate response at [ADDRESS_940534] of a second dose at an appropriate interval to evaluate under -dosing as the 
explanation for treatment failure.  Given (i) the rarity  of the disease and in particular due to 
the rareness of flaring events precluding t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_693498], (ii) the serious and 
potentially  life threatening nature of moderate/severe GPP and (iii) the favorable efficacy , 
safet y and tolerability profile of BI 655130, exploration of lower doses in GPP patients 
presenting with a flar e (trial 1368- 0013) is considered to be not feasible or worthwhile .
4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
An Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) will be used to screen eligible patients, perform 
drug assignment, manage initial/re -supply  orderi ng of drug supplies and handle emergency  
un-blinding. The investigator will receive all necessary  instructions to access the I RT from 
the Sponsor. Detailed IRT functions and procedures will be documented in the user 
requirement specifications mutually  agre ed to b y the sponsor and the IRT vendor.
During Visit 2 and after the patient’s eligibility  has been confirmed, the treatment will be 
assigned via IRT. Patients will be randomized to receive BI 655130 900 mg or placebo in a 
ratio of 2:1. The assignment will occur in a blinded fashion via IRT. The site is also required 
to register Visit 9 (Wk1/D8) in I RT. On registering the visit, I RT sy stem will determine if a 
drug assignment (Treatment with open label BI 655130) is required. At the subsequent visits 
where stud y medication (Rescue with open label BI 655130) is to be administered (if 
applicable. i.e. in the event of recurrence of flare. Refer to Table 3.1:1 ), the site is required to 
complete the rescue medication module in the I RT. 
At randomization as well as subsequent medication administration visits (if applicable), IRT 
will assign medication numbers. Site personnel will enter the medication numbers in the 
eCRF.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
The treatment to be evaluated is outlined in Table 4.1.4: 1 below. I t will be assigned to each 
patient after the completion of the randomization visit ( Visit 2) , verification of all inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and verification of criteria for initiation of treatment (s ee Section 
3.3.4 ).
Upon randomization, patients will receive the BI 655130 or placebo on Day 1. For further 
details concerning timing see the stud y Flow Chart . The start and end times of the infusion 
will be recorded.  Detailed instructions for the preparation of the infusion solution, the 
volume to be administered, and the infusion rate are provided in the ISF.

period of 90 minutes. In case of safet y concerns, e.g. due to systemic h ypersensitivity
including (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for further details) infusion reactions, it is at the discretion of 
the investigator or his/her designee to adapt the infusion scheme, including but not limited to 
slowing down the infusion rate, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_51119], and provided no further safety concern 
exists, restarting at a slower rate. Regardless, the total duration of infusion should not exceed 
180 min utes (3hours).  Further based on his/her medical judgment the investigator will 
provide medications as needed. 
The administration of the trial medication will be done under the supervision of the 
investigating ph ysician or a designee. The so -called four- eye principle (two- person rule) is 
recommended for administration of trial medication and – if applicable –its preparation, if 
correct dosage cannot be ensured otherwise.

[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Patients and investigators involved in the trial conduct will alway s remain blinded with 
regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after database lock for the final trial 
analysis.
If the trial team agrees to perform the primary  analy sis and the final anal ysis separatel y (see 
Section 7.3), then a database lock for the primary  anal ysis will b e done and treatment will be 
unblinded to trial and project team members. 
If the trial team agrees to perform the primary  analy sis and final anal ysis as one single 
analysis (at the time of trial completion), then patients, investigators, and sponsor personnel 
involved in the trial conduct will be unblinded to the randomized treatment assignme nts after 
the database lock has been performed.

the exclusion from the analy ses of PK samples taken from placebo patients. Bio anal yticswill 
not disclose the randomization code or the results of individual measurements until t he trial 
has been officiall y unblinded to the sponsor. Sample drug levels and demographic data 
together with treatment assignments and dosing information may  be made available to named 
individuals from bio analytics department for the p urpose of PK dataset generation and 
analysis in accordance with sponsor’s standard procedures.
A fully  external DMC will perform an unblinded safet y and efficacy assessment at specified 
intervals in order to ensure that patients are protected from potential harm, please refer to 
Section 8.7 for further details.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] provides the r ules surrounding breaking of the randomization code.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator / pharmacist / investigational drug 
storage manager via IRT (for Japan: only  to the investigator).  It must only  be used in an 
emergency  situation when the identity  of the trial drug must be known to the investigator in 
order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure the safety  of trial 
participants. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or 
appropriate CRF page along with the date and the initials of the person who broke the code.
In case the automated unblinding option via the IRT sy stem is malfunctioning, the IRT 
service provider can be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (24 hours a day coverage) and the treatment allocation can 
be obtained.  IRT support has direct access to the database and the treatment information can 
be manuall y obtained in case the automated process is not working properly.  Details about 
this process will be inc luded in the I SF.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may  be necessary  for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to 
access the randomization code for individual patients during trial c onduct. The access to the 
code will only  be given to authorized Pharmacovigilance representatives and not be shared 
further. 
Treatment unblinding will be performed prior to each DMC meeting as a prerequisite for 
generation of the applicable DMC summaries required, as well as subsequent to the primary  
analysis database lock (if applicable), and the final trial database lock at which time the final 
trial anal yses will be performed. Treatment unblind for the study  will be officially  released 
once database lock for the final trial anal ysis has been performed.

treatment with BI 655130.
When a non- acute h ypersensitivity  reaction related to immune complexes (i.e., serum 
sickness) is suspected, please draw a sample for the laboratory assessment for circulating 
immune complexes.
In case of potential s ystemic allergic reaction, blood samples for determination of serum 
tryptase will be collected 0.5 h, 2 h, 6 h, 24 h after onset of the event.
Severe infections (according to RCTC grading the ISF), serious infections, opp ortunistic or 
mycobacterium tuberculosis infections
Treatment of the infection should be initiated promptly according to local standard of care. 
No further trial medication should be administered until the active infection has resolved. 
Treatment with BI 655130 may  be restarted when the patient has recovered according to 
investigator’s assessment.
Active/Latent TB:
QuantiFERON® ( or if applicable, T- Spot®) TB test will be performed at screening. If the 
result is positive, the patient may  participate in the study  if further work up (according to 
local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusivel y that the patient has no evidence of active 
tuberculosis. Active TB patients must be excluded. If presence of latent tuberculosis is 
established, then treatment shou ld have been initiated and maintained according to local

the TB test results are not available in time for randomization, these patients may  receive 
randomized treatment (provided they  meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria) as long as 
the investigator has ruled out active disease based on available documented history  (i.e. 
negative for active TB) within [ADDRESS_940541] of care.

5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
The primary endpoint, the key secondary endpoint and the secondary endpoints,  
 are specified in Sections 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.2.2, respectively.
Skin condition will be assessed by [CONTACT_693516] (GPPGA), the Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (GPPASI), and the Psoriatic Symptom Scale (PSS), Patients’ questionnaires  
 Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue), 
Pain VAS,  will be used as well. 
Additional details for these assessments are provided below.  Methodological details for the evaluation of the scores/index are described in the ISF.
Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment (GPPGA)
GPPGA relies on clinical assessment of the GPP patient’s skin presentation. It is a modified 
PGA, a physician’s assessment of psoriatic lesions, which has been adapted to the evaluation 
of GPP patients ( R15-5200
). The investigator (or qualified site personnel) scores the 
erythema, pustules, and scaling of all GPP lesions from [ADDRESS_940553] clear. 
GPPGA is provided in Appendix 10.1.1; this score will be measured at the timepoint noted in 
the study Flow Chart .
Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (GPPASI)
The GPPASI is an adaptation for GPP patients of the PASI, an established measure of 
severity and area of psoriatic lesions in patients with psoriasis ( R96-3541). Similar adaptions 
have been used for PPP ( R16-3360). In the GPPASI, the induration component has been 
substituted with the pustules component. It is a tool that provides a numeric scoring for a patient’s overall GPP disease state, ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected by [CONTACT_93489], pustules and scaling and the severity of erythema, pustules, and scaling (desquamation) over 4 body regions.
GPPASI is provided in Appendix 10.1.2 ; this score will be measured at the timepoint noted in 
the study Flow Chart.

The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire ( R10-6433, R07-4311, R16-0029) that 
assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. Answers are 
based on a 5-point Likert scale. Responses of “not at all,” “a little,” “somewhat”, “quite a bit,” and “very much” are available for each question, and correspond to scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (total score range: 0-52). A minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 3-4 points in change score has been reported (R16-0029). The recall period for items is 7 days.
The FACIT fatigue scale (Version 4) is provided in Appendix 10.1.4; this score will be 
measured at the timepoint noted in the study Flow Chart .
PSS
The PSS is a 4-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument that was developed to assess 
the severity of psoriasis symptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis ( R18-1990). 
The symptoms included are:  pain, redness, itching, and burning. Current symptom severity is assessed using a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). The symptom scores are added to an unweighted total score (range:  0 to 16).
The PSS instrument is provided in Appendix 10.1.5 .
Pain VAS
The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity ( R18-1989). It is a continuous 
scale comprised of a horizontal or vertical line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, 
anchored by [CONTACT_334835] (“no pain”, “very severe pain”). The pain VAS is self-completed by [CONTACT_100179]. The respondent is asked to place a vertical ( | ) mark on the horizontal line to indicate the severity of the pain. Using a ruler, the score is determined by [CONTACT_23808] (mm) on the 10-cm line between the “no pain” anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0–100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.
Pain VAS will be measured at the timepoint noted in the study Flow Chart. The Pain VAS 
instrument is provided in Appendix 10.1.9 .

Complete and targeted phy sical examinations will be performed at visits as described in the 
Flow Chart. Height and weight of the patient will be recorded at the Screening Visit.
Complete phy sical examination will include vital sign assessment and general appearance as 
well as evaluation of all organ s ystems. Targeted phy sical examination will include vital sign 
assessment and evaluation of organ s ystems associated with AE(s) s ymptoms or laboratory  
abnormalitie s.
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings will be reported as baseline conditions or AEs. 
5.2.2 Vital signs
Vital signs evaluations will be performed at visits as shown in the Flow Chart. This includes 
measuring temperature, pulse rate, s ystolic/diastolic blood pressure and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], pulse rate, and blood pressure will be measured after patients have been 
sitting comfortabl y for at least [ADDRESS_940559] of blood sampling on the vital 
measurements. 
At visits with i.v. administration, vital signs will be assessed pre -dose, at approximately  5 
minutes a fter the end of infusion and 120 minutes after the end of infusion. On non -study –
drug administration day s, vital sign assessments are to be done prior to blood sampling.
In addition to the temperature being measured along with the vital signs at time poi nts shown 
in the Flow Chart, additional fever assessments will be recorded on dosing day s at three time 
points. If the patient will receive medication for fever treatment, the fever assessment will be 
performed prior to taking the anti-fever treatment. These fever assessments must be taken 
whether or not the patient has an elevated temperature and whether or not the patient takes 
anti-fever treatment. The fever assessments times are to be separated b y intervals of 2 to 4 
hours on dosing day s.At all othe r visits (non-dosing day s), fever will be assessed once a day  
and will be completed prior to receiving medication for fever treatment, if anti -fever 
treatment is given.
During i.v. drug administration, patients should be closely  monitored for signs and s ymptoms 
of hy persensitivity  reactions for approximately  2 hours after the study  drug administration.

ECG results.  The 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded and reviewed prior to dosing as scheduled 
in the Flow Chart . The investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or 
abnormal and whether it is clinically  relevant, if abnormal. ECGs may  be repeated for qualit y 
reasons and the repeated recording used for anal ysis. No central laboratory  will be used for 
ECG recording.
Additional ECGs may  be recorded for safet y reasons. The electronic version, if applicable, or 
dated and signed printouts of the ECG, will be regarded as source data and will be stored in 
the patient’s medical file.
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings will be repo rted either as baseline condition (if 
identified at the screening visit) or otherwise as adverse events and will be followed up 
and/or treated as medically  appropriate.
5.2.5 Local tolerability
Local tolerability  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_693517] ‘swelling’, ‘induration’,

tolerability  will be assessed during the IMP administration and for approximately  2 hours 
after the stud y drug administration. Grade t he intensity  of the local tolerability  according to 
RCTC grading (cf. ISF).
Other Safet y Parameters:
In case of an infusion reaction, monitor the patient per standard of care, grade the intensity  of
the reaction according to RCTC grading (cf. ISF) and proceed as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
All cases of malignancies, sepsis or other serious infections and disseminated intravascular 
coagulation that are detected during the trial will be reported as SAEs. Please refer to the 
current list
of “Alway s Serious AEs” provided in eDC.
5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of Adverse Events 
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny unto ward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
Boehringer Ingelheim 26Jun 2020
BI Trial No.:1368 -0013
c15875404-04                      Clinical Trial Protocol Page 65of 149
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940567]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE whi ch fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe.
-requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]   
- requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],
-results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity , 
-is a congenital anomal y / birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event which, when 
based on appropriate medical judgement, may  jeopardize the patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50069]. 
For Japan only :the following events w ill be handled as “deemed serious for an y other 
reason”. AEs which possibly  lead to disability  will be reported as SAEs.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], subsections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has developed a list of further AEs, which b y their nature, can alway s 
be considere d to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above. The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. 
These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described above.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940568]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016Adverse events of spe cial interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on know ledge from other compounds in the same class. 
AESI s need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see above.
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
Hepatic Injury ,is defined by  [CONTACT_15624]:
An elevation of AST and/or AL T and/or AP ≥3 -fold UL N plus 2 times the baseline, 
combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold UL N plus 1.5 times the baseline, 
measured in t he
same blood draw sample , or
aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥ [ADDRESS_940569]
Any patients with these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to the ‘Drug -
Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) checklist’ provided in the I
SF. In case of clini cal sy mptoms of 
hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , unexplained coagulopathy , right upper 
quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the 
investigator should make sure these parameters are analyzed, if necessary  in an unscheduled 
blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury  alert, the procedures 
described in the DILI checklist should be followed.
Systemic h ypersensitivity reactions including Infusion reactions and anaphy lactic reaction
Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_577031] h ypersensitivity including infusion reactions and any 
anaph ylactic reaction should be defined and assessed using the criteria discussed in the 
statement paper from Sampson HA ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 10.1.6; (R11-4890).
Severe infections (according to RCTC grading in the I SF)
Opportunistic and my cobacterium tuberculosis infections
These include pneumocystis jirovecii, BK virus disease including PVAN, CMV, post-
transplant ly mphoproliferative disorder (EBV), progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy , 
bartonellosis (disseminated only ), blastomy cosis, toxoplasmosis, coccidioidomy cosis, 
histoplasmosis, aspergillosis (inv asive only ), candidiasis (invasive or pharyngeal), 
cryptococcosis, other invasive fungi (mucorm ycosis (zy gomycosis, rhizopus, mucor, 
lichtheimia), scedosporium/pseudallescheria bo ydii, fusarium), legionellosis, listeria

Protocol -specified AESI can be classified as serious or non- serious but all AESI  must be 
reported in an expedited manner similar to serious adverse events on a S AE form (i.e. non 
serious AESI must be reported on the SAE form and follow the same reporting timelines as 
for serious AEs).
Intensity of AEs
The intensity  grading of AEs will be performed according to RCTC Version 2.0 developed 
by [CONTACT_693518] i n Rheumatology  (OMERACT) organization ( R13-3515) . Refer to 
the ISF for intensit y/severity  classification. 
Intensit y options are:
Grade [ADDRESS_940571] that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug. 
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the do se is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:

of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking i nto 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
Additional arguments amongst those stated be fore, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment contin ues or remains 
unchanged.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting
AE Collection
The Investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files. 
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  [CONTACT_1275]:
For patients rolling over into open label extension trial (1368- 0025):
From signing the informed consent of the parent trial onwards until the first dose of trial 
medication in the extension trial:
all AEs (non- serious and serious) and all AESIs.
For patients not rolling over into subsequent OLE trial (1368- 0025):
From signing the informed consent onwards until the individual patient’s end of trial:
all AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs.
After the individual patient’s end of tria l:
the investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for AEs but should only
report related SAEs and related AESIs of which the investigator may  become aware 
of by
[CONTACT_23321], e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be
reported on th e BI SAE form, but not on the CRF .
The follow -up period describes the period of time from the last administration of trial 
medication until the end of trial examination (last per- protocol contact).  
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The investigato r must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
sponsor’s unique entry  point (country  specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940573]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions 
the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
eCRF pages and, if applicable, the BI SAE form. The investigator should determine the 
causal relationship to the trial medication. 
The following should also be reco rded as an (S)AE in the CRF and, if applicable, BI SAE 
form:
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093].
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior to trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only . All (S)AEs, including those 
persisting after a patient’s end of trial, must be followed up until they  have resolved, have 
been  assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further information can be obtained.
Pregnancy
Urine pregnancy  testing should be done prior to study  drug administration. Study  drug should 
only be administered in case of a negative test result. I n case of a positive urine pregnancy  
test, a serum pregnancy  test will be done. Women who underwent tubal ligation are still 
considered of childbearing potential and pregnancy testing is necessary  as well. The testing 
schedule is specified in the Flow Chart .
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must immediately  (within 24 
hours) report an y drug exposure during pregnancy by [CONTACT_15627] A of the Pregnancy 
Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry  point.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an acc ompany ing SAE 
and/or AESI, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form

assessments of drug exposure. The biomarkers and pharmacogenomic parameters are outlined in Section 5.4 are of exploratory nature only.
Information about race should be obtained from all study participants as allowed by [CONTACT_427]. This is because the prevalence and characteristics of psoriasis may differ between patients of different racial origin. It will thus be worthwhile to assess if patients of different race will respond differently to the study treatment.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule specified in the Flow Chart .  Each visit date 
(with its window) is to be counted from Day 1 (V2). 
All deviations from the planned visit schedule are to be documented.  If any visit has to be 
rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedule. Additional visits for the purpose of retesting of laboratory parameters or AE monitoring may be included as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].
For detailed description of the trial procedures, please refer to the Flow Chart.Details relating to study drug administration are provided in Section 4.1.4.  
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
Study procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Flow Chart and respective 
sections of this protocol.  Refer to Section 5 for explanations of the specified assessments and 
procedural details.
Based on the investigator’s clinical judgment, patients may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190211], during or 
following first study drug administration.  If so, patients will perform the needed visits as inpatients.  Subsequent visits will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and the investigator’s judgment (For details, see Flow Chart and Section 3.1 ).
The patients’ questionnaires (PSS,  pain VAS, FACIT-Fatigue, ) are to 
be completed by [CONTACT_199085]/her own in a pre-specified order in a quiet area/room before any other visit assessments or treatments, and, if possible, before any interaction with the investigator or other members of the study team, and, without any help from or interpretation by [CONTACT_88360]. If the patient is too sick to complete the questionnaires him/herself but is able to reply verbally, a member of the study team should read the instructions, questions, and response options aloud to the patient and collect the patient’s verbal response in as neutral and unbiased a manner as possible. If this is not possible either, the questionnaires are not to be completed. The mode of administration should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  p  )

6.2.1 Screening period
Screening (Visit 1):
After patients have been informed about the trial, written informed consent in accordance 
with GCP and the local legislation must be obtained prior to performing any study related procedures. 
Once consent is obtained, the patient is considered to have started the screening process, and 
is assigned a unique patient number by [CONTACT_82550].  The patient is to be recorded on the enrolment log and be registered in the IRT system as a screened patient.  Study requirements, including the procedure for the follow-up of prematurely withdrawn patients, must be fully explained to the patient and written informed consent obtained prior to initiating any study-related evaluation. The importance of staying in the study until completion of all requirements is to be emphasized.  No study procedures are to be done unless the patient has provided consent to take part in the study.
Demographics :
Informed consent date, gender, ethnicity and race (if allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) will be collected 
and reported in the eCRF.
Baseline Conditions:
Chronic diseases, current observable conditions, any new clinically relevant findings 
discovered from the physical examination, ECG, safety labs, and any condition requiring therapy (excluding GPP) will be reported on the Baseline Condition eCRF page.  )

All patients who are screened must be registered with I RT. 
Re-screening: 
If a patient results in a screen failure (i.e. does not meet the eligibility  criteria , or does not 
flare within the 6 month screening period ) the patient must be registered as a screen failure in 
IRT s ystem.  However, re -screening of a previously  screen failed patient will be permitted 
once. Upon re -screening, the patient will be assigned a new patient number. Details of IRT 
procedures can be found in the I RT manual located in the I nvestigator Site File (ISF).

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN – MODEL
This trial is designed as a randomized, parallel- group, double -blind, and placebo- controlled 
trial with one active dose of BI 655130 in patients with GPP presenting with an acute flare of 
moderate to severe intensity .
The primary  objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy , safet y and tolerability  of a 
single i.v. dose of BI 655130 in comparison to placebo at Day  1. The primary  anal ysis, on 
each of the binary , primary  endpoint, achievement of a GPPGA pustulation subscore of 0 at 
Week 1, and key  secondary  endpoint, achievement of a GPPGA of (0, 1) at Week 1, where 
any use of escape medication prior to observing the endpoint is considered to be a non -
response, will compare the proportion of patients who achieve a response on BI [ADDRESS_940597], will be used to perform the primary analysis. Confirmation 
of efficacy  is then given if the proportion of patients achieving a response on the primary  
endpoint is s tatistically  significantly  higher for BI 655130 than for placebo. Formal statistical 
hypothesis testing will be performed at an overall 1 -sided alpha level of 0.025.
Stratification of randomization will be performed in this trial for Japan versus non-Japan. 
This stratification is implemented for operational purposes only  and is not intended to be used 
as an adjustment factor in the primary  analy ses of efficacy  (see Section 7.6 ).

end of the trial once all randomized patients have completed the trial (including an y follow -
up period) if applicable.
The primary  anal ysis and final anal ysis may  be performed as a single anal ysis (at the time of 
trial completion), if, prior to the time of the primary  anal ysis, the trial team agrees that the 
expected time interval between the planned anal yses is insufficie nt to justify  the performance 
of separate analy ses. 
Details of treatment unblinding for the primary  analy sis and final anal ysis are described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Details of the anal ysis to be performed will be described in the TSAP.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_940606]-03(14.0)/Saved on:17Oct2016There will be 3 main patient populations in this trial for analy ses: the randomized set (RS), 
the safet y set (SS), and the per -protocol set (PPS).
Randomized Set 
This patient set includes all randomized patients. Treatment assignment will be as 
randomized. This is the main anal ysis set for presentation of efficacy . 
Safety  Set 
This patient set includes all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of 
study  drug. It will be the main anal ysis set for presentation of safet y. Patie nts will be 
analyzed according to the actual treatment.
Per-Protocol Set  
This patient set includes all patients in the RS who adhered to the CTP without any  Important 
Protocol Violations (I PVs) potentially  affecting the study  outcome which lead to exclu sion 
from the PPS. This set will be used for sensitivity  anal ysis on the primary , key  secondary , 
and secondary  efficacy  endpoints which are included in the testing hierarchy .
Important violations of the protocol will include violations of the key  inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, incorrect medications taken, concomitant use of restricted medications, escape 
medication given without evidence for disease worsening, and an y other violations of the 
protocol deemed important by  [CONTACT_2362]. All decis
ions concerning important protocol 
violations will be made prior to un- blinding of the database for the final trial analy sis.
Further anal ysis sets, e.g. for the BM assessments, will be defined in the Trial Statistical 
Analy sis Plan (TSAP).
Standard stat istical parameters (number of non -missing values, mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, quartiles, minimum and maximum) or frequency  tables (including patient 
frequencies and percentages) will be calculated where appropriate.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
The anal ysis for the primary  endpoint includes t he evaluation of patients achieving a GPPGA 
pustulation subscore of 0 at Week 1. 
Any use of escape medication, e.g. use of restricted medication for disease worsening in 
Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1, prior to observing the primary  endpoint is considered to reflect a failure to 
achieve the endpoint outcome, i.e. non -response (see primary  endpoint definition in Section 
2.1.2 ).
Due to the small sample size of the trial , an exact statistical test will be used to assess the 
statistical significance of the treatment effect versus Placebo. Since the traditional Fisher’s 
exact test may  be unnecessarily  conservative, an alternative test, the Suissa -Shuster Z- pooled 
test, will be implemented in this trial. The Suissa -Shuster Z- pooled test alway s preserves the 
type I error level and is usually  more powerful than the Fisher’s exact test.

sided, alpha level of 0.025.
Secondary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint will include:
A sensitivity  anal ysis utilizing the PPS;
Analysis of an additional estimand whereb y any use of escape medication prior to week 1 
will be considered to represent a non -response. For patients who use other restricted 
medication but not for disease worsening prior to Week 1, data will be censored for 
further anal ysis following the use and imputed using the methods described in Section 
7.5.
Sensitivity  analy ses which utilize alternative methods for the handling of missing data as 
described in Section 7.5. 
A subgroup assessment according to the Japan vs. non -Japan strata will be assessed 
descriptivel y
Sensitivity  analy ses to adjust for the covariates, IL36R mutation status (Yes vs .No) and 
baseline GPPGA total score (3 vs. 4) respectively  using logistic regression.
Further anal ysis of the primary  endpoint will include:
Analy sis of the time to first achievement of a response on the primary  endpoint via 
Kaplan -Meier methods.
7.3.2 Key Secondary endpoint analyses
The anal ysis for the key  secondary  endpoint , for patients achieving a GPPGA score 0 or 1 at 
Week 1 ,will be performed in the same manner as described for the anal yses of the primary  
endpoint .
Any use of escape medication, e.g. use of restricted medication for disease worsening in 
Table [IP_ADDRESS]: [ADDRESS_940608] a 
failure to achieve the endpoint outcome, i.e. non- response (see key  secondary  endpoint 
definition Section 2.1.3).
7.3.[ADDRESS_940609] on the following secondary  endpoints, 1) the proportion of patients 
achieving a GPPASI 75 at Week 4, 2) the change from baseline in pain VAS at week 4, 3) the 
change from baseline in total PSS score at week 4, and 4) the change from baseline in the 
total FACIT -Fatigue sco re at Week 4, will be tested in a hierarchical manner as a part of the 
pre-specified testing strategy, subsequent to the test of the primary  endpoint and key  
secondary  endpoint, which is defined in Section 7.2 . 
The anal ysis for the proportion of patients achieving a GPPASI  75 at Week 4 (where an y use 
of escape medication/OL BI 655130 at D8/rescue treatment with BI 655130 prior to 
observing the endpoint(s) is considered to represent a failure to achieve the endpoi nt 
outcome, i.e. non -response) will be performed using the same approach as that defined for the 
primary  endpoint anal ysis of the study  based on the RS.

Other secondary  endpoints
For all patients who were treated with BI 655130 either through initial randomization, or 
through OL BI 655130 at D8, additional summaries of the following endpoints at Week 4 
will be done where an y use of escape medication prior to Week 4 is considered to represent a 
non-response:
•
The proportion of patients with GPPGA 0 or 1 at Week 4, 
• The proportion of patients with a GPPGA pustulation subscore of 0 indicating no 
visible pustules at Week 4
Other secondary  endpoints will be presented in an exploratory  manner using the methods 
described above. Frequencies and percentages will be presented for categorical endpoints; 
descriptive statistics will be used for continuous data. If applicable, 95% confidence intervals 
will also be display ed.

Adverse events will be coded using the current version of Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  
Activities (MedDR A) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be 
produced.
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned. 
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end 
of the residual effect period will be considered ‘treatment- emergent’; the residual effect 
period (REP) is defined as [ADDRESS_940613] drug 
intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -emergent’.  For 
all subjects who received OL  BI 655130 at D8 or rescue medication with BI 655130, safet y 
assessments including adverse events, laboratories, vital signs etc. which occurred subsequent 
to such intake will be excluded from presentations according to the planned treatments; these 
data will, however, be included in summaries where all data after an y use of BI 655130 are 
display ed.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the 
MedDRA. 
The exposure adjusted incidence rate (per [ADDRESS_940614] y ears) of a selected treatment emergent 
adverse event is defined as the number of subjects experiencing the adverse event per 
treatment group during time at risk divided by  [CONTACT_693520]  100 (per [ADDRESS_940615] 
years), where: 
Time at risk [subject y ears] = (date of onset of TEAE –study  drug start date + 1) /

With regards to the handling of missing data on the primary, key secondary and secondary binary efficacy endpoints, a Non Response Imputation will be applied as the primary imputation approach that is, imputing as a failure to achieve a response, however:
∀If there are available data at the visits both before and after the visit with a missing 
outcome, then impute as a success only if both the preceding and the following

655130 at D8 or rescue medication with BI 655130 within this imputation period; 
Otherwise, impute as a failure to achieve a response (i.e. no response imputation [NRI ]).
NRI is a conservative imputation scheme because it assumes that withdrawal (or missin g data 
due to an y other reason) is related to treatment failure. Other imputation schemes will 
therefore be considered for the primary , key  secondary  and secondary  binary  efficacy  
analyses including:
Best response imputation: impute all missing values bas ed on the best response 
observed at visits prior to withdrawal/occurrence of missing data. If there is no non -
missing data available, then the missing value will be imputed as a failure.
If fewer than [ADDRESS_940624] of all 
possible treatment differences will be generated whereb y each of the potential 
responses (response, non -response) will be imputed for each patient in an exhaustive 
manner.

random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non -
predictable. Access to the codes will be controlled and documented.
Stratification for Japan versus non-Japan will be done in order t o assure that sufficient 
patients per treatment group are recruited specifically  to support individual country  
submission in Japan; these strata will be treated as operational strata and will not be included 
into the analy ses of efficacy  endpoints. 
Withi n each stratum (Japan vs. non-Japan ), patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (BI 
655130 vs. Placebo). The randomization will be done in blocks to achieve balanced 
allocation. The block size of the randomization will be documented in the CTR.
The proce ss of randomization is done via an IRT. Practical aspects of the treatment allocation 
process are detailed in Section 4.1.3.
7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
Based on an application of the defined testing strategy (see Section 7.2 ), a simulation based 
power calculation has been performed for sample size assessment on both the primary  and 
key secondary  endpoints. For this purpose , the correlation of the two endpoints is set to be 
0.[ADDRESS_940632] of BI 655130 on the proportion of patients achieving a GPPGA pustulation 
subscore of 0 at Week 1 and separatel y on the proportion of patients achieving a GPPGA 
score of (0, 1) at Week [ADDRESS_940633] 60% of patients will have complete 
GPPGA pustulation subscore of [ADDRESS_940634] 
60% of patients will have a GPPGA score of 0 
or 1. In comparison, only 10% of patients on placebo are expected to have response to each 
of the primary  endpoint and key  secondary  endpoint at Week 1. 
The power estimates below for detecting th e clinically  relevant differences , for the 
primary  
endpoint, the proportion of patients with a GPPGA pustulation subscore of 0 at Week 1 and 
the key  secondary  endpoint, a GPPGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 1, were derived using R 
version 3.3.2, for a sample size of 51 patients (2:1 ratio), and a 1 -sided t ype I error of 0.025. 
The results are as given in Table 7.7: 1 .

medical records, would be acceptable. 
During the site visit the sponsor’s Clinical Research Associate (CRA) or auditor must be 
granted access to the original patient file (please see Section 8.3.2). The investigator must 
ensure that all patient identifiers (e.g. patient’s name, initials, address, phone numbe r, social 
securit y number or applicable national identification number or information as per local laws) 
have properly been removed or redacted from an y copy of the patients’ source documents 
before sending them to the sponsor.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol, any  corrective action e.g. re -training must be 
documented in the patient file.
For the CRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example: 
Patient identification: gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations)
Patient participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date patient was 
informed)
Dates of patient’s visits, including dispensing of trial medication
Medical history  (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)

Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaph ylaxis ( R11-4890).
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both ( e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -
uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOW ING
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_11310] ( e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dy sfunction ( e.g., hypotonia 
[collapse], sy ncope, incontinence)
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Involvement of the skin- mucosal t issue ( e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -
tongue -uvula)
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_11310] ( e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)
c. Reduced BP or associated sy mptoms ( e.g., hypotonia [collapse], sy ncope, incontinence )
d. Persistent gastrointestinal sy mptoms ( e.g., crampy  abdominal pain, vomiting)
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Infants and children: low sy stolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% dec rease in 
systolic BP*
b. Adults: sy stolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline 
PEF, Peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]; BP, blood pressure.
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg 
+[2 x age] from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

Description of change Co-primary  endpoints have been converted into 
primary  endpoint and key  secondary  endpoint.
The primary endpoint of the study is:

reflecting the clearance of pustules at week 1, and a 
key secondary  endpoint representing the overall 
improvement in GPP skin sy mptoms based on the 
achievement of a GPPGA score of 0 or 1 at week 1. 
The trial is still powered in order that success on 
both o f these endpoints can be achieved.

Description of change Footnote 23 has been clarified to
Patients who achieved a clinical response
improvement to study  treatment (not including 
escape treatment) and show no flare s ymptoms of 
moderate/severe intensity  at V14 or V15 will be 
offered to enter into an open label extension (OLE) 
trial (1368 -0025), if they  have completed this study  
(EoS/V14 or V15) and meet the inclusion criteria 
for the OLE trial.
Rationale for change Clarified that as long as the patients show clinical 
improvement or benefit from BI 655130, the 
patient may  qualify  to enter OLE trial. The patient 
does not have to have clinical response of GPPGA 
of [ADDRESS_940697] dose of trial medication on the 
OLE trial (1368 -0025), the investigator must 
continue to capture the AEs in this trial until the 
patient receives 1stdose in the OLE trial. Please 
refer to section [IP_ADDRESS] for further details.
Rationale for change Updated information to emphasize that if the date 
of EOS visit for this trial is not the same as the date 
of first dose of trial medication on the OLE trial 
(1368 -0025), the investigator must continue to 
capture the AEs in this trial until the pati ent

Section to be changed Section 1.2.1 Mode of action
Description of change BI 655130 is a humanized antagonistic monoclonal 
IgG1 antibod y that blocks human IL36R signaling . 
Binding of BI 655130 to IL36R is anticipated to 
prevent the subsequent activation of IL36R by  
[CONTACT_190216] (IL36 α, β and γ) and downstream 
activation of pro -inflammatory  and pro -fibrotic 
pathway s with the aim to reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231]/ 
fibroblast/ im mune cell -mediated inflammation and 
interrupt the inflammatory  response that drives 
pathogenic cy tokine production in inflammatory  
diseases including GPP, palmoplantar pustulosis 
(PPP), Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD).

Rationale for change Updated Information. Since the sample size has 
increased, it is likely  that we may  have to recruit 
more countries to meet the recruitment goal. 
Section to be changed Section 3.1 Overall Trial Design and Plan
Description of change Added the following updated text:
Fifty -one patients with generalized pustular 
psoriasis (GPP) presenting with an acute flare of 
moderate to severe intensity are required to be 
randomized to receive BI 655130/ placebo (2:1) 
into this trial.
Rationale for change Updated Information reflecting the increase in 
sample size and/or recruitment period. Also, per 
Health Authority  recommendation, it is important 
that additional patients (i.e. bey ond 27) be recruited 
into this trial in order to enhance the safet y 
database in the acute GPP flare setting and, 
consequently, the assessment on benefit -risk. These 
additional patients also allow for a more robust 
assessment on the clinical efficacy , i.e. in a 
situation where the placebo rate is unexpectedl y 
higher than the original estimate for both primary  
and key  secondary  endpoints.
Section to be changed Section 3.1 Overall Trial Design and Plan
Description of change Updated as following:
Patients who achieved a clinical response 
improvement to BI 655130 and who show no flare 
symptoms of moderate/severe intensit y at V14 or 
V15 visit will be offered to enter into an open label 
extension (OL E) trial (1368 -0025), if they  have 
completed this study  (EoS/V14 or V15 visit, see 
below) and meet the inclusion eligibility criteria 
for the OLE trial.
Rationale for change Clarified that as long as the patients show clinical 
improvement or benefit from BI 655130, the 
patient may  qualify  to enter OLE trial. The patient 
does not have to have clinical resp onse of GPPGA 
of 0 or 1 to qualify  to enter in OLE trial.

Patients and investigators involved in the trial conduct will always remain blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after database lock for the final trial analysis.
If the trial team agrees to perform the primary 
analysis and the final analysis separately (see Section 7.3), then, a database lock for the primary analysis will be done and treatment will be unblinded to trial and project team members.

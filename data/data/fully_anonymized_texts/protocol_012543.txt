STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
Study visit overview:  
 The patient -related activities of the PUVENAL FD trial 
are divided into 5 phases:  
1. Screening of eligibility for enrolment (Visit 0),  
2. 2
nd Screening with MRI -PDFF (Visit 1)   
3. Randomization (Visit 2), 
4. Phone call at 1 month for compliance   
5. Visit at 3 months (Visit 3), and  
6. Visit at 6 months (Visit 4) 
7.  Screening of eligibility for enrol lment (Visit 0): 
All participants undergo a Fibroscan first (≥ 300db) and 
must meet criteria for ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_634070] self -
report through medical history . Participants are not 
allowed to use any prescription or over-the- counter 
medication , or herbal remedy taken with an intent to 
improve or treat fatty liver, liver disease , or obesity for 
the 3 months before randomization. Such agents include but are not limited to thiazolidinediones (TZDs). These 
agents are not to be used during screening nor f or the 
duration of the trial. If a  participant is using a statin or

fibrate medication to improve hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_492918], he/she is required to be on a stable dose in 
the [ADDRESS_634071] 2 
months before randomization and are prohibited after 
randomization  and will be assessed by a Food Frequency 
Question naire (FFQ) at screening V0  with <200mg/d DHA 
and/or <60mg/d EPA intake to qualify fo r enrollment . 
 
8. 2nd Screening with MRI -PDFF (Visit 1) 
For those participants who pass the first screening criteria, a n assessment of liver fat percentage by [CONTACT_9268] -
PDFF will occur to confirm ≥12% liver fat content for 
trial eligibility. A second ALT measure will be taken to confirm ALT ≥ 4 0 as well as second alkaline phosphatase, 
and bilirubin measures.  If results exceed more than 50% 
from first lab  results, and are above the normal range , 
then a third test (unscheduled visit) will be repeated 
(only for the elevated test(s)) before V2 to determine the direction of the change. If the third test shows a continued increase  greater than 25% higher than the 
second test  in ALT, Alk -P or Bilirubin the su bject will be 
disqualified.  For those that qualify, all values will be recorded on the CRF.  
 
9. Randomization (Visit 2 ): 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the study interventions or placebo and stratified by [CONTACT_492948] (in no greater than  50% of sample).  
 
10. Phone call at one month for Compliance  
 
11. Visit at 3 months (Visit 3) and visit at 6 months 
(Visit 4 ):  
For details see Table for Scheduled Assessments 
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
For a within -subject 3.6% absolute reduction in liver fat 
for the combination group vs. placebo and setting α=0.05 and 80% power , n=60/arm  for the combination 
and placebo groups are needed. [1, 2] To estimate 
secondary outcomes of DHA alone and Vitamin E alone versus placebo with a confidence interval ±3% of liver fat, n=30/arm for the DHA only and Vitamin E only groups are needed. With 10% expected attrition, the total sample size is 200 subjects.  
Sample will be stratified  by [CONTACT_492949] (no greater than 
50% of sample).

Introduction  
1.2 Background information  
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by [CONTACT_492950] (via imaging or histology) and is not due to 
secondary liver fat accumulation from excessive alcohol consumption or hereditary disorders 
(e.g. Wilson’s disease) [3]. NAFLD is most commonly associated with metabolic syndrome, 
consisting of  obesity, insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure  and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. NAFLD is one 
of the most common causes of chronic liver disease, globally with  a prevalence as high as 30% in 
Western countries [4]. It includes a spect rum of diseases from steatosis to non -alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [5]. Non -alcoholic 
fatty liver  does not involve hepatocellular injury in the form of ballooning hepatocytes, whereas 
NASH is defined by [CONTACT_492951] , inflammation,  and hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or without 
fibrosis  [3]. The causes of NAFLD are likely due to a combination of genetic and physiologic 
factors, namely those that promote oxidative stress and inflammation such as metabolic 
syndrome, visceral adiposity, and changes in intestinal microbiota  [6]. NAFLD is significantly 
associated with increased risk of Type II Diabetes and cardiovascular disease , and increased 
overall mortality compared to age matched controls. There is currently no approved drug 
treatment for NAFLD or NASH. Dietary restriction for weight loss and increased physical activity are the recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_492920].   
1.3 Investigational products 
1.3.1  Vitamin E [(all -rac)-α-tocopheryl acetate]  
Vitamin E is a fat -soluble vitamin that is synthesized naturally in plants  in four tocopheryl  forms: 
α, β, γ and δ. All- rac-α-tocopheryl  acetate has the highest biological activity in animal models 
[7] and it is the α -tocopheryl  form that is used to prevent and treat Vitamin E deficiency in 
humans. Functionally, Vitamin E is an antioxidant  and peroxyl radical scavenger. It is an  inhibitor 
of lipid peroxidation and can also inhibit and modulate intracellular signal ing molecules, e.g. 
protein kinase C, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH) oxidase [7]. α -
tocopheryl  regulates  gene expression of several intracellular enzymes such as 5 -lipoxygenase and 
cyclooxygenase and has anti-inflammatory activity (i. e. decreasing cytokine release and  plasma 
C reactive protein).  It is also known to inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation.  
 
In hepatocytes, Vitamin E suppresses expression of xanthine oxidase, a source of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). It inhibits the propagation of peroxyl radicals by [CONTACT_492952] a hydroperoxide, nonradical product [8]. Proliferation and 
enlargement of hepatic peroxisomes are seen in hepatic steatosis. In patients with NASH, increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_259224], including adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) depletion is present. These patients also have higher cytochrome 
P450 activity which metabolizes long chain fatty acids  producing increased ROS. Such increased 
ROS enhance lipid peroxidation and form aldehyde by -products such as malondialdehyde and 
increased cytokines e.g. tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF -α) and transforming growth factor- β (TGF -
β), markers of inflammation. Th ese cytokines can damage mitochondrial DNA and function , 
leading to a continuous cycle of peroxidation, fatty acid oxidation , and inflammation that result 
in hepatocyte apoptosis and eventually fibrosis. Vitamin E’s antioxidant, anti- inflammatory, and 
inhibitory intracellular signaling functions prevent the propagation of free radicals and 
inflammatory processes.  
 Vitamin E has been shown to have a beneficial effect on NAFLD in previous studies. In a meta -
analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) , Sato  [9] demonstrated that vitamin E 
significantly reduced liver enzymes: aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase

(ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and significantly decreased steatosis, lobular 
inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning compared to control or placebo. In this meta -
analysis, hepatic fibrosis was improved with Vitamin E but was not statistically significant 
(p=0.06). In the largest of these trials, Sanyal [10] found that 800  IU Vitamin E (as RRR-α-
tocopherol) /day for 96 weeks, administered to 84 non -diabetic adults with NASH  significantly 
improved NASH , based on a composite score of histologic features, by 43% compared to 19% in 
the placebo group (n=83) (p=0.001). The rate of  improvement of the comparator, 30 mg/d 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_492921] 34% and not significantly different from placebo.  Significant reductions in 
hepatic steatosis and lobular inflammation were se en with both agents, but improvement in 
fibrosis was not significant. Other smaller studies in adult patients with NAFLD or NASH [11]  [12] 
[13] and [14] , given 500 -800 IU/day Vitamin E have also shown significant decreases in liver 
enzymes, steatosis [12] [13] [14],   inflammation [12] [13], and ballooning  [13]. Two of the trials 
administered Vitamin E with background ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) but guidelines from the 
American Association of Study for Liver Disease considers UDCA ineffective for NAS H 
treatment [15].  
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) ,[16] has established the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for 
Vitamin E as 1000 mg/d of α-tocopheryl  (all stereoisomers), equivalent to 1000 IUs by [CONTACT_492953]. Few adverse effects are seen below doses of 2100  mg according to IOM. The [LOCATION_006] 
Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals, [17] also established a safe upper level of consumption 
of 800  IU. Sanyal’s 2010 study [10] which used 800  IU Vitamin  E found no differences between 
groups in adverse events including no difference in number of cardiovascular events. Although a study by [INVESTIGATOR_158342] [18] of 400IU Vitamin E and Prostate cancer risk found a 17% increased risk in 
healthy me n, other studies have found either no increased risk or decreased incidence in 
prostate cancer  [19] [20] and improved prostate cancer survival  [21]. In an 18 yea r follow up of 
the Alpha- Tocopheryl , Beta -Carotene  (ATBC) Cancer Prevention study [22], α -tocopheryl  had no 
effect on prostate cancer incidence (RR 0.97), no effect on overall mortality and decreased prostate cancer mortality (RR 0.84). Additionally, a n Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
(AHRQ) report  [23] concluded that trials of Vitamin E altoge ther had no overall effect on cancer.  
 
1.3.2  DHA Ethyl Ester  
Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC -PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an important 
omega -3 fatty acid for brain, eye and cardiovascular development and health. It significantly 
reduces triglycerides (TGs), lowers heart rate  [24], lowers blood pressure [25], and reduces the 
risk of cardiac death by [CONTACT_141307] 8% [26] . Both DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have anti-
thrombotic, anti- inflammatory , and anti-oxidative properties [27]. As NAFLD patien ts are at 
significantly greater risk of cardiovascular disease and higher overall mortality, t he 
cardioprotective effects of DHA are significant  and may be beneficial in the NAFLD population.  
 
Potential mechanisms for DHA’s effects in NAFLD include reduction of TG synthesis via activation 
of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR -α and γ) which accelerates fatty acid 
oxidation in liver mitochondria [5]. DHA is also known to have an integral role in maintaining and improving cell membrane fluidity, as a fatty acid that is incorporated into the phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_492922], thereby [CONTACT_492954]. The anti -inflammatory role of DHA in NAFLD may be mediated through activation of 
adiponectin secretion through the PPAR -γ path. Adiponectin improves lipid oxidation and 
reduces insulin resistance and inflammation [5] [28]. DHA also decreases expression of pro -
inflammatory cytokines and increases DHA -derived prostaglandins and leukotrienes which inhibit 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. DHA -derived resolvins, protectins, and maresins are also anti -
inflammatory by [CONTACT_492955]  [27]. Many of these mechanisms may 
contribute to the effects of DHA on metabolic syndrome and improve liver function in NAFLD.  
 A meta -analysis by [CONTACT_309914] [5] demonstrated decreased levels of DHA in NAFLD patien ts compared 
to case controls, and their analysis of [ADDRESS_634079], TGs, 
< PUVENAFLD  >

and liver fat  with doses of 1-5 g/d omega -3 supplementation. They showed that with each one 
gram/day increment in DHA, decreases in liver enzymes, i .e. -7.42 U/L ALT, - 5.3 U/L AST, and -
7.26% reduction in liver fat were  achieved. Other meta -analyses of RCTs [ [28] [29, 30]  have also 
shown significant  decreases in liver fat and positive  results (or positive trends) in  liver enzymes: 
decreases in ALT, AST, GGT, significant decreases in TGs, and increases in high -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) with omega -3 supplementation in NAFLD patients. As reported by 
[CONTACT_492956] [30] a 27% reduction of steatosis, measured by [CONTACT_2207],  was seen across 5 trials  
with doses of 2 -5g/d omega -[ADDRESS_634080] of 
omega -3 (DHA+EPA) ethyl esters (Lovaza®, 4g/d), Scorletti [2] demonstrated an overall trend for 
a decrease in liver fat (β= -3.64, p=0.1) but compliance and contamination in the placebo group 
limited the significance of the results. However, a regression analysis of DHA  independently 
showed a significant 1.7% decrease in liver fat for each 1% increase in red blood cell (RBC) DHA 
(p=0.007) ; when adjusted for cofactors such as age, gender, body weight, each 1%  increase in 
RBC DHA, was associated with a 3.3% decrease in liver fat (p=0.0001). This relationship was not 
seen with EPA. A larger RCT of EPA ethyl ester alone [31] in patients with biopsy -confirmed 
NASH found no significant differences in the NAFLD ac tivity score, steatosis, inflammation, 
ballooning, or liver enzymes between 2 doses of active (1.8  g/d or 2.7  g/d) and placebo. 
Although this trial was conducted in pat ients at a later stage of disease and had a higher than 
expected placebo response rate, the results collectively may suggest that DHA is the key omega -
3 fatty acid to provide benefit for patients with fatty liver, i. e. NAFLD. 
  
1.4 Rationale for conducting the  clinical study  
The combination of Vitamin E and DHA has not been tested in previous clinical trials of adults 
with NAFLD. This combination may provide optimal benefit for patients with NAFLD due to their 
associated  mechanisms of action, namely Vitamin E’s antioxidant action, preventing lipid 
oxidation of long chain fatty acids such as DHA  and thus preventing the propagation of free 
radicals and ROS . Vitamin E’s protection of LC -PUFA DHA therefore assists it  in maint aining cell 
membrane stability and optimal signalling. Their combined anti -inflammatory effects (e.g. 
inhibiting pro- inflammatory cytokines, increasing adiponectin, and producing docosanoids to 
resolve inflammation) may also be efficacious for those with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD. The combination of Vitamin E and DHA will specifically be used in this study to determine if a 
reduction in liver fat occurs after 6 months of co- administration, using a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) technique, proton density fat fraction (PDFF). PDFF imaging is non -invasive and 
highly sensitive to detect liver steatosis in patients with NAFLD. PDFF imaging is significantly 
more accurate than liver ultrasound -based transient elastography (TE) in detecting steatosis 
(AUROC 0.9 9 vs. 0.85 by [CONTACT_783] -CAP) [32] [33]. It also significantly correlates with histology-
determined steatosis (I
2=0.56, p<0.0001) in adults with NAFLD  [34]. MRI -PDFF is also an 
appropriate t echnique to  diagnose and stage disease  in those with metabolic syndrome and 
NAFLD. The clinical trial is designed to test the combination of Vitamin E and DHA against placebo, to 
demonstrat e efficacy and safety. It is not powered however, to compare the combination 
against each of the active products for superiority. Each active product will be included as 
additional treatment arms to gain further insight into their contribution to changes in NAFLD 
parameters and to collect additional safety data.

administration of therapeutic levels of vitamin  E, including use for up to one year in NAFLD 
patients at dose levels of 800mg/d, has shown very few AEs.  Additionally, Section 5.2.1 of the 
Investigator’s Brochure  discusses potential adverse effects involving blood coagulation from 
oral intake of high -dose vitamin E and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], anti- coagulant drugs and/or vitamin K deficiency. 
 When given in tablets, vitamin E  may cause some, all or none of the side -effects listed below at

 DHA EE (study drug) is an essential nutrient found in highest quantities in salmon, mackerel, 
oysters and anchovies. It is essential for the body’s cells to function.  
 The Investigator Brochure for DHA EE in  Tables 5 -1 and 5 -2 lists published studies in healthy 
adults and in those with various medical conditions with DHA and include dose, duration and safety outcomes. The maximal dose tested was 12g/d DHA in a prostate cancer study of 6 months duration; one SAE of urinary obstruction in one subject was reported and considered unrelated to DHA administration. There have been no deaths associated with the use of DHA in these studies. Table 5 -5 in the IB provides a frequency table of reported AEs by [CONTACT_382811] 
556 subjects (DHA n=379; PBO n=220); the most commonly reported AEs  attributed to DHA are 
gastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, Table [ADDRESS_634102] frequent SOC, infections and infestations.  Scorletti, et al, 2014 reported no SAEs attributed to omega -3 administration (Omacor
® 4g/d: 1.52g DHA EE and 1.84g EPA EE) over 15 -18 
months in NAFLD patients. 
 
Literature citations for toxicology studies with DHA are found in Module 2, 24 -Nonclinical 
overview, section 2.4.6 and cited publications can be found in Module 4, 43 -lit-ref. 
 When given in tablets, DHA EE may cause some, all or none of the side -effects listed below at 
the dose and duration used in the study.

5.6 Concomitant treatments/supplements and restrictions 
 Participants are not allowed to use any prescription or over -the-counter medication, or herbal 
remedy taken with an intent to improve or treat fatty liver, liver disease or obesity for the 3 months before randomization. Such agents include  but are not limited to , TZDs. These agents 
are not to be used during screening nor for the duration of the trial. If a participant is using a statin or fibrate medication to improve hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_492925], he/she is required to be on a stable dose in the 3 months  before randomization. Additionally, participants are 
allowed to continue  on prescription anti- hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_124643], if they are on a stable dose . 
Participants on antidiabetic medication  are allowed in the trial if they are on a stable dose in 
the 3 month s prior to randomization.  Use of fish oil, algal oil or Krill oil supplements, drugs , 
e.g. Lovaza
® or foods fortified with omega -3s are not allowed for at least 2 months before 
randomization and are prohibited after randomization.  Fatty fish intake (e.g. salmon, tuna, 
herring, etc) is restricted to <2 fish meals/week. Participants are interviewed with a FFQ for LC -
omega -3s at screening, randomization, and at every visit to document the quantity of LC -omega -
3s consumed. Vitamin E sup plementation of greater than 100 IU/day are not allowed in the [ADDRESS_634103] qualified MRI facilities.  It is anticipated that sites will 
pre-screen subjects from their existing databases to identify potential subjects for this study.  It 
is expected that an advertising  and/or social m edia campaign will be needed also to assist with 
recruitment. Each site will create a recruitment plan in order to meet study recruitment goals.

A second fasted blood draw  (>10 hours) for ALT , AST, Alkaline phosphatase, and Bilirubin will be 
taken to confirm the first lab  results at V 0. If results exceed more than 50% from first lab  
results, and are above the normal range, then  a third test (unscheduled visit) will be repeated  
(only for the elevated test(s) ) before V2 to determine the direction of the change. If the third 
test shows a continued increase  greater than 25%  higher than the second test  in AL T Alk- P or 
Bilirubin  the subject will be disqualified.  For those that qualif y, all values will be recorded on 
the CRF.    
 
All participants will undergo a Fibroscan (≥ 300db) at the first screening visit , V0 and then, after 
liver enzymes and all other labs, are confirmed to be within eligibility cut -offs, (V1) an 
assessment of liver fat percentage  (min. 12%) by [CONTACT_9268] -PDFF examination will occur. MRI scans will 
be sent to a Central reader  to assess the eligibility for enrolment into the trial.

required for trial eligibility. One standard MRI protocol will be used at all sites and one blinded 
central MRI reader will analyse all MRI assessment s. A study- specific MRI -PDFF protocol will be 
developed for all participating sites. Changes in liver fat % assessed by [CONTACT_9268] -PDFF will be 
measured in localized regions of interest (ROI) within each of the liver segments. MRI -PDFF will 
also be performed at V isit 4 (6  mos) using the same procedures.  
 
7.3 Other key assessments 
7.3.1  Liver Fibroscan  
Transient elastography (Fibroscan), a rapid measure of liver tissue stiffness, will be used at Visit 
0 to assess for eligibility in the trial and will be performed prior to MRI-PDFF . Qualifying cut off 
score on Fibroscan is CAP ≥300db . If the subject meets this cut off, then the MRI -PDFF is 
performed  at the second screening visit .  
7.3.2  Liver Fibrosis score  
Fibrosis- 4 score (FIB -4) predicts changes in fibrosis  with high specificity. The FIB -[ADDRESS_634112]/platelet count x √ALT. The FIB -[ADDRESS_634113] to hip ratio and BMI will be calculated.  Sites are advised to counsel the subjects to 
avoid major fluctuations in diet and exercise during the study.  
 
7.3.4  Alcohol Consumption  
At Visit 0, subjects will provide their typi[INVESTIGATOR_492929] (>21 drinks per week in men and > 14 drinks per week

the treatment response.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_634116] (dipstick) will be conducted at 
the site at both Screening (Visit 0) and Randomization (Visit 2) to determine eligibility in the 
trial. A positive pregnancy test during screening or at randomization is exclusionary for trial eligibility. Negative results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
7.3.6  Question naires  
The Medical Outcomes Stu dy 36 -Item Short -Form Health Survey (SF -36), a quality of life 
assessment will be administered to subjects at Visit 2 and 4. See Appendix 2.  
 
A validated FFQ [35] to measure LC-PUFA dietary intake (namely DHA and EPA) will be 
administered at visits V0, V2, phone call at 1mos, V3  and V4 . See Appendix 1.  
 
[ADDRESS_634117].  
 Any of the following conditions leads to premature withdrawal:  
• request by [CONTACT_492965] (withdrawal of consent)  
• erroneously included / randomized subject  
• adverse eve nt or concurrent illness that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], warrants the 
subject’s withdrawal from intervention  
• intake of concomitant medication s/dietary supplements prohibited by [CONTACT_760]  
• volunteers who do not follow the requirements of the investigator, especia lly those 
concerning safety and/or if the subject , after his enrolment  is uncooperative or not 
willing to comply with the protocol (non -compliant) 
• failure to return (lost to follow -up) 
• request by [CONTACT_492966]  
• pregnancy, i.e. a protocol exclusion  criterion  
 The circumstances of any discontinuation must be documented in detail in the corresponding 
study disposition  form in the eCRF. Whenever a subject is withdrawn from the study for 
whatever reason, every effort will be made to perform a final assessment to include standard 
medical and laboratory tests (including a final MRI , if possible ) which would have been done 
upon normal completion of the study, i.e. V4 . The data of the withdrawn subjects will be 
documented in the clinical study report  and may be used in statistical analyses . 
 
Note: S
 ubjects who withdraw prematurely from the study will not be replaced.

9 DATA PROCESSING AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Case Report Form  
9.1.1  Electronic Data Capture  
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator(s) to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the 
eCRF. One eCRF must be compi[INVESTIGATOR_492930].  
 
Data required for the analysis will be acquired and transferred electronically to a central database by [CONTACT_492967] (the “EDC -tool”). The system operates 
over the Internet according to the principle of online data capture. Data entered by [CONTACT_492968] 
a central database, without any permanent local storage.  
 
High security standards for the transfer and storage of study data are guaranteed by [CONTACT_492969], such as encrypted data transfer, firewalls and periodic backup to protect centrally 
stored data. Writing access to the system will be limited to authorized personnel and the system 
will automatically keep an audit trail of all entries and corrections to t he eCRF. Training in the 
use of the EDC -tool will be provided by [CONTACT_492970].  
 The EDC -tool will comprise an eCRF, designed specifically for the present study.  
 
The EDC -tool is operated under an electronic signature, consisting of the combin ation of an 
identification code and a password. In relation to the present study, passwords and electronic 
signatures will be distributed to users of the EDC tool, and used for entering, modifying , or 
viewing study data.  
 It is the responsibility of individuals who receive an electronic signature [CONTACT_492997], i.e., not to reveal it to third parties, and to access the EDC -tool, to enter or modify 
study data using the EDC -tool only under their personal identification code and password.  
9.[ADDRESS_634118] quality control and review of the eCRF, and create a Data Management 
Plan, including programming and validation of the database, user training, data handling and 
edit checks, data cleaning and query generation and processing, medical coding, SAE reconciliation and database closure. Key site and CRO  personnel will be trained on the eCRF and 
the EDC system.  
 
9.3 Statistical Analysis 
 
9.3.1  Statistical hypotheses and methods 
The primary hypothesis of the study is that V itamin E and O mega -3 fatty acid  (DHA EE)  in 
combination will  reduce hepatic fat fraction  greater than placebo after 6 months of intervention  
in adults with NAFLD.  
< PUVENAFLD  > 
 
 
Protocol no.:  2017-
1088  Version: 
3  Date: 5/10/[ADDRESS_634119] deviation, median 
and range. Categorical variables will be summarized with counts and percentages. SAS® version 
9.4 or higher will be used to analyse the data.  
 
9.3.2  Primary endpoint analysis  
Decrease in hepatic fat fraction [%] relative to baseline between Vitamin E + DHA  EE 
combination vs. placebo, measured by [CONTACT_9268] -PDFF after 6 months of intervention .  The decrease 
will be analysed with a linear mixed model with the hepatic fat fraction in % at 6 months as 
response variable. The hepatic fat fraction in % at baseline, treatment group and diabetes status 
will be included as fixed effects. Site will be included as random effect. This representation is formally identical to an analys is that uses the  change in hepatic fat fraction in % (6 mos vs. 
baseline) as response variable and the hepatic fat fraction in % at baseline, tre atment group and 
diabetes status as fixed effects and site as random effect [Laird, N. Further comparative analyses of pre -test post -test research designs. The American Statistician 1983, 37: 329 -330; 
O’Connell, N. Methods for Analysis of Pre -Post Data in Clinical Research: A Comparison of Five 
Common Methods. Journal of Biometrics and Biostatistics, 2017. 8(1):1 -8.]. However, this 
representation is chosen since it allows for easier variance -stabilizing transformations if 
necessary.    Statistical tests of significance will be 2 -tailed at a 5% significance level. 
With blinded data, the residuals of the model will be  analysed visually (QQ -plots, residual plots) 
to determine if the model assumptions (normality, variance, homogeneity) are met. If necessary, variance -stabilizing transformations will be considered.  
 
9.3.3  Secondary endpoint variable(s)  and analyses  
o Differences in hepatic fat fraction  [%], measured by [CONTACT_9268] -PDFF after 6 months of intervention, 
between DHA and placebo will be estimated with the same model as the primary endpoint. 
The estimated difference will be displayed with its 95% confidence interval . 
o Differences in hepatic fat fraction  [%], measured by [CONTACT_9268] -PDFF after 6 months of intervention, 
between Vitamin E and placebo will be estimated with the same model as the primary endpoint. The estimated difference will be displayed with its 95% confidence interval.  
o Between group differences i n anthropometric measures , after 3 and 6 months of DHA EE 
and/or Vitamin E intervention will be analysed with the same approach as the primary 
endpoint, using the relevant anthropometric measure at baseline as the respective baseline 
covariate and gender a s a categorical covariate.  
o Between group differences in inflammatory markers  after 6 months of intervention and liver 
enzymes after 3 and 6 months of DHA EE and/or Vitamin E intervention will be analysed with 
the same approach as above  and diabetes status as a categorical covariate  included in the 
model. 
o Between group differences in the FIB -4 score after 6 months of DHA EE and/or Vitamin E 
intervention will be analysed with the same approach as above.

With blinded data, the residuals of the models will be analysed visually (QQ -plots, residual 
plots) to determine if the model assumptions (normality, variance homogeneity) are met. If 
necessary, variance -stabilizing transformations or non -parametric methods will be 
considered.  
 
9.3.4  Exploratory variables  
Transcriptome analysis of gene expression will be performed in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells in a subset of (n=40) subjects (~[ADDRESS_634120] s/ treatment arm). Changes in gene expression 
from baseline to end of treatment (6 months) will be examined. The analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_2681]. Briefly, d ifferentially expressed genes will be analysed by [CONTACT_134245]. The false discovery 
rate (q values) will be used to correct for multiple testing. Using the global gene expression profiling results, an extensive pathway analysis (e.g. MetaCore program and/or Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis) will be conducted to better understand gene regulation, mechanisms of action 
and activated pathways by [CONTACT_492973].

 Sub-set analyses of PNPLA3, HSD17b and haptoglobin SNPs will be conducted on the Primary endpoint to assess potential genotypic responses to treatment. 
 
9.3.5  Safety variables  
All SAEs and AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_19313]. The number of subjects experiencing any events will be examined and the frequency of occurrence by [CONTACT_492974] ( MedDRA) codes. 
 Vital signs, Hematology , Lipid panel, and Clinical C hemistry data will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_492975] [ADDRESS_634121] S quares Means and 95% Confidence Int ervals.  
 A sub- set analysis will be performed in those with elevated baseline TGs to assess changes with 
the intervention over 6 months.  
 
 
9.3.6  Compliance Analysis  
A compliance analysis will be performed on all randomized participants who completed the study (6 mos) and ingested at least 80% of the study product using plasma DHA levels (µg/ml) 
and plasma α-tocopheryl (µmol/L) to confirm accuracy of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]. ANOVA models will be 
employed with treatment as a factor. Frequency counts and percentages will also be presented for subjects who were at least 80% compliant by [CONTACT_1570]. Differences in this categorical outcome will be assessed using Fisher's Exact Test.  
 
9.3.7  Sample size:   
Le et al. [1] report that the variability (standard deviation) of the within -subject change in liver 
fat [%] for a period of 24 months in a similar population and with the same measurement method (MRI-PDFF) is 7%. Expecting a within -subject 3.6 4% absolute reduction in liver fat for the 
combination group vs. placebo [1, 2]  and setting α=0.05 and 80% power, n= 60/arm for the 
combination and placebo groups are needed  (G*power [IP_ADDRESS], two-sample t -test).

To estimate the secondary endpoints (effect vs. placebo of the components (DHA EE alone and 
Vitamin E alone)) with a given precision (confidence interval width) of ±3% of liver fat, we need n=30/arm for the DHA EE only and Vitamin E only groups, leading to a necessary sample size of 
180. With 10% expected attrition , the total sample size is 200 subjects.  
 
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_492976] (no greater than 50% of sample).  
Subjects who withdraw p rematurely from the study will not be replaced.  
  
9.3.8  Study Populations 
o The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects who receive at 
least one dose of study product, according to the product to which they were randomized. The primary efficacy analysis will be on the ITT population.  
o  The Per- Protocol (PP) population will include subjects who completed the study according to 
the protocol . The subject’s data will be excluded from the per protocol analyses if the 
subject fails to meet one or more of the inclusion criteria at enrollment or meets one or more of the exclusion criteria. Data will be excluded if the subject has other significant protocol deviations or significant non -compliance with taking the study product (to be 
deter mined at a blinded data review meeting).  
o  The Safety population will include all subjects randomized into the study who received at 
least one dose of study product, according to the product they actually received.  
 
9.3.9  Poolability of Data  
It is considered that data will be pooled across sites for all analyses, unless significant deviations or imbalance in one or more sites is identified.  Such discrepancies will be reviewed at the 
blinded data review meeting. Heterogeneity of the variability across sites will be investigated, and assumptions regarding the homogeneity of the variability across sites will be relaxed in the applied statistical model if necessary.  
 A statisti cal analysis plan (SAP) will be written by [CONTACT_492977] . The SAP will detail the handling of missing data  and will 
outline all analyses to be conducted.  
10 SAFETY  
10.1  Definitions and Standards  
 
Adverse Event (AE):  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject involved i n a clinical study  administered an 
investigational product , whether or not related to this product.  
 An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding for example), subjective and objective symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, accidents, and whether or not considered relat ed to the product or study -
related procedure  and reported by [CONTACT_280635].  
 
Adverse Reaction (AR):

Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) SAR means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the product or clinical trial 
material caused the AE . A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an AR, 
which means any AE caused by [CONTACT_20141]. 
 
Serious Adverse Event ( SAE):  
Any AE that at any dose fulfils at least one of the following criteria:  
 
• I s fatal (results in death)  
(note: death is an outcome, not an event)  
• is life -threatening  
(note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetically 
have caused death had it been more severe)  
• requ ires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
(note: “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to an unplanned, overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
(n ote: the term means substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life 
function) 
• i s a congenital anomaly/birth def ect 
(n ote: congenit al anomaly/birth defect in offspring of subject taking the product 
regardless of time to diagnosis)  
• is medically significant  
(n ote : Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in other situat ions, such as important medical events 
that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492932] s above).  
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):  
All suspected adverse reactions that are both unexpected and serious.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Reaction:  
An adverse reaction, the nature, or severity or incidence of which is not consistent with the applic able product information (e.g. Investigator’s B rochure).  
10.2  Adverse event assessment  
Expectedness:  
An unexpected AE is an event of which the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product information.  
  
 
Causality Assessment:  
The causality assessment of an AE to the investigational product will be rated as follows:

 No (Not related):  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to product 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 Yes (Related):  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to product administration makes a causal relationship possible, and o ther 
drugs, therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 Suspected  There is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the observed event. Suspected implies a less er 
degree of certainty about the causality of the observed event  
 
Severity / Intensity:  
The severity / intensity of AEs will be graded on a five -point-scale: 
- Mild or Grade 1: discomfort noted, but no disruption to normal daily activities. 
- Moderate or Grade 2: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activities.  
- Severe or Grade 3: inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
- Life threatening or Grade 4   
- Death or Grade 5  
 
Outcome of event : 
The outcome of an event will be classified as follows: 
- Recovered  
- Recovered with sequelae  
- Ongoing 
- Fatal  
- Unknown / Lost to follow -up 
10.3  Safety Management 
 
10.3.1 Procedures  
All AEs occurring during clinical studies are recorded in the eCRF and are classified according to  
the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) system . AEs should be captured from the 
screening visit ( V1) to the end of the study .  Refer to the 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_8.5x11.pdf and  https://livertox.nih.gov/Severity.html, for additional  information.  
 
CTCAE Terms  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. An AE is a term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analyses. Each CTCAE v4.0 term is a Me dDRA LLT (Lowest Level Term).  
 CTCAE Grades  
Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline:  
 
< PUVENAFLD  >

Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
 
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care 
ADL**.  
 Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5 Death  related to AE. Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and 
therefore is not an option. 
 
A Semi- colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
A single dash ( -) indicates a Grade is not available. Not all Grades are appropriate for all 
AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five options for Grade selection.  
Definitions  
A brief Definition is provided to clarify the meaning of each AE term. A single dash ( -) 
indicates a Definition is not available.  
 
Navigational Notes  
A Navigational Note is used to assist the reporter in choosing a correct AE. It may list other AEs that should be considered in addition to or in place of the AE in question. A single dash ( -) indicates a Navigational Note has not been defined for the AE term.  
 Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self- care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden. 
 SAEs are reported in the eCRF and processed according to the applicable FDA requirements 
governing the conduct of clinical studies. All SAEs will be followed until resolution or at the 
latest [ADDRESS_634123]’s completion in the study.  
 S[LOCATION_003]Rs are reported and processed according to the FDA requirements governing the conduct of 
clinical studies.  
 When an unexpected SAE not previously listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) occurs in a 
multi- center clinical study, all investigational sites currently involved in the study should be 
notified by [CONTACT_492978].  SAE and S[LOCATION_003]Rs are  also reported to  a third -party vendor (referenced as Pharmacovigilance 
Vendor (UBC) ) per flowchart below .  
 SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be recorded on the electronic SAE Form. Following case processing, a US 
FDA MedWatch Form 3500A will be generated from the Pharmacovigilance Vendor for S[LOCATION_003]Rs. 
The event is entered into the PV safety database for filing and further expedited reporting  by 
[CONTACT_492979] -Principal Investigator.

The directions for completing the SAE Form are detailed in the “ CRF Guidelines”. This g uideline 
will be available  to all sites in the study.  
 
For S[LOCATION_003]Rs, study treatment may be unblinded prior to reporting the case to the applicable 
regulatory authorities and IRB/IEC.  Please see section 4.[ADDRESS_634124] (DSMB) will be arranged  to review the safety information in the 
trial on a bi -annual basis. Details of the DSMB’s responsibilities will be outlined in a DSMB plan.  
 SAEs will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_492980] . 
 
During or at the end of each study, an SAE reconciliation between data entered in the study 
database and the data entered in the pharmacovigilance database will  be performed if any SAE 
has occurred in the study. All discrepancies found during the reconciliation are documented in an SAE reconciliation report and corresponding queries are sent to the investigators for clarification.  
 Since pregnancy is an exclusion criterion in the study, then for any case of  pregnancy occurring 
during the conduct of the study, the course of the pregnancy and the outcome of both the mother and the offspring have to be documented in the eCRF and on the Pregnancy Form. This 
form will be provided to sites in the study, if needed.  
 
The directions for completing the Pregnancy Form are detailed in the “Guidelines for Completing the Pregnancy Form”. This guideline will be provided to sites in the study when needed.

physician's , nurse's and research assistant’s notes, appointment book, original laboratory 
reports, X-rays, pathology, and special assessment reports, signed informed consent 
forms, consultant letters, and subject screening and enrolment logs.  
 
The Investigator should retain the study documents of the ISF for the retention time specified in 
their contract.  
 Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to 
another location, CRO must be notified in advance.  
 If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site for any 
or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made with the I nvestigator and CRO to 
store these in a sealed container(s) outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the

data) provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accord ance with local requirements 
and as specified in the contract . 
The Study Coordinator (SC) or Study Nurse (SN) at the site of the investigation will be instructed 
by [CONTACT_492988]: 
• Monitoring the study supplies and, if requested, returning all undispensed supplies to manufacturer or CRO  at completion of the study.  
• Maintaining all records of the study.  
• Checking source documents for legibility and completion at the time they are received 
from the investigator. After review of study data with the invest igator, the SC/SN will 
complete the formal eCRFs. 
• If required by [CONTACT_1758], removing tear -off labels on receipt of double -blind labelled 
investigational product  prior to its being dispensed to the subject/patient.  
• Contact[CONTACT_492989] a final disposition for every subject/patient who is entered in the study.

• Checking for reasonableness and completeness of source documents and of recorded CRF 
data before CRFs are reviewed by a m onitor at each routine monitoring visit.  
It will be the monitor's responsibility to review the study documents (e.g. CRF s) at regular 
intervals throughout the study, to verify the adhere nce to the protocol and the legibility, 
completeness, consistency , and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor must 
have access to laboratory test reports and other subject records needed to verify the entries on 
the CRF .  
The investigator (or his/her deputy) facilitates the monitoring tasks including the source 
document verification  and agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any issues 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

All IP used in clinical studies are subjected to quality control. Quality assurance audits may be 
performed by [CONTACT_492990]

 The study documents will be retained for a period of 2 years following the date a marketing 
application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated; or if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and F DA is notified.  
 The Trial Master File (TMF) shall be retained for a longer period, where so required by [CONTACT_492991]/or as specified in the contract of the

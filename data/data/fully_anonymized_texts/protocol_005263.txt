Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_250855] Title: Underutilization of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209878]:  Chan ning E. Tate, MPH  
Mentor: Ronica Rooks, PHD  
Version Date:  0124/19        
 
I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :  The goal of this study is to determine if poor health literacy 
and/or insufficient knowledge of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209879]. Additionally, the study will evaluate the influence of perceived discrimination and mistrust in 
healthcare on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209880].  
 
Aim 1:  To evaluate the relationship between literacy, mistrust and perceived discrimination on 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209881].  
 
Aim 2 : To evaluate the effect of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209882] t materials on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209883].  
 II. Background and Significance : 
Research demonstrates that African Americans fail to enroll in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249] ,
1,[ADDRESS_250856] common among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209884]. The increasing number of people of 
color living with debilitating chronic disease and the contin ued growth of healthcare expenditures 
threatens  to financially overburden Medicare . By [CONTACT_2892] 2050,  African Americans will comprise 
nearly 12% of Americans over the age of 65 .3 These factors create a significant need for 
interventions to increase hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209885].  
There is limited research that explores the reasons driving underutilization of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209886]. Many researchers reduce the disparity to religious and/or cultural beliefs and an inherent preference for more aggressive treatments .
1,4-[ADDRESS_250857] that White 
providers are less likely to provide information about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209887].15-19 Other cultural barriers for African Americans include an 
emphasis on informal or family caregivers and family -centered decision making,20,21 and the 
importance of integrating religious and spi[INVESTIGATOR_209888] .6,20-24 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209889] -centered care models and accommodates patients’ religious and spi[INVESTIGATOR_86263], but this 
core pi[INVESTIGATOR_209890]. Inaccurate and inadequate information about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209891] .
12,14,[ADDRESS_250858] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209892] (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209893]) that will 
potentially address knowledge and literacy barriers to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209894]. The 
decisional support materials conform to the rigorous standard of the Internal  Patient Decision Aid 
Standards (IPDAS), which is an organization that ensures the production of high- quality patient -
centered decision aids.  
This st udy hypothesizes  that low health literacy correlates to low hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209895]. This  
hypothesis  builds on prior work by [CONTACT_209940]27,28 which demonstrates  poor health

 literacy is a stronger predictor of end of life choices than race. These studies focused specifically 
on end of life decisions in patients wit h dementia. Some scholars criticize the Volandes team’s 
work for producing heavily biased videos that show graphic representations of end- stage disease 
and treatments that shock patients into choosing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].[ADDRESS_250859] is to use 
a neutral decision aid representing the benefits and disadvantages of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. The content of this 
decision aid heavily relied on input from stakeholders such as patients, caregivers and the div erse 
variety of providers who care for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69223]. The decision aid presents general information about hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209896], unlike Volandes’ decision tools.    
Additionally, this study hypothesizes that  standing  paradigms of discrimin ation perpetuate 
a systemic mistrust in healthcare. African Americans were systematically and intentionally excluded 
from healthcare and the evolution of the modern healthcare system. From pre- slavery America 
through the middle of the [ADDRESS_250860] and improve perceptions of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].   
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
We conducted and extensive qualitative needs assessment and environmental scan of 
available hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209897]. Though the needs assessment we interviewed 5 patients, 20 caregivers and 27 providers (e.g. social w orkers, nurses, chaplains) regarding their perceptions of 
participating in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. In the preliminary analyses, we found that all participant groups describe misunderstandings and myths regarding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209898].  
Additionally, we learned that timing of introduction and initiating of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209899] a major theme 
across all participants. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209900]. As a 
result, caregivers expressed regret for not being awar e of or enrolling their loved ones in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209901].  
People from varying different backgrounds, races/ethnicity and cultures participated in the 
qualitative  needs assessment . Overwhelmingly participants from diverse race and ethnic  
backgrounds felt a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209902]. Study participants felt any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209903]. Participants advocated for a neutral balanced tool that clearly 
explained the pros and cons of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], detailed the eligibility requirements and accurately 
described the payment mechanisms for hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_3677].  
Our environmental scan found only [ADDRESS_250861] all participants went to sites such as yelp to get narrative 
descriptions of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187621].33 
 IV. Research  Methods  
A. Outcome  Measure(s):   
Protocol Template  Page 3 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 Overview:  The goal of this study is to test whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209904].  
 
Primary Outcomes : There are t hree primary outcomes for the study  which are change in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209905] , change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_209906] (HBAS)  and decision 
self-efficacy will be measured the Decision  Self-Efficacy Scale . These scales utilize a scoring 
scheme in which a higher score indicates more knowledge and a more positive view of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], and m ore decision self -efficacy , respectively.  
 
Description of surveys  for primary outcomes : 
• Knowledge of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209907] : The Knowledge of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209908] a 23- item scale wit h 
true/false questions.34,35 The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the scale is 0.75 showing 
good internal rel iability.  
• Decision Sel f-efficacy:  Is an 11- item instrument that one’s self -confidence in decision 
making. This scale is a validated scale with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92 and correlates with DCS subscale of being informed (r=0.47). Based on our prior study of a decision aid in palliative care, we hypothesize that one of the strongest effects of a decision aid might be 
to increase self -efficacy of the decision making.
36   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209909] (HBAS) : The HBAS is an 8- item scale developed to 
measure beliefs and attitudes towards hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677].12 It has a Cronbach’s α = .74 for the 
scale, indicating a good degree of internal reliability.   
• Demographic Form- a brief demographic form t o record SES, age, sex and comorbidities 
such as diabetes, heart di sease, and cancer . 
Description of qualitative writing sample:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209910]. Matsuyama et 
al37 described a brief qualitative assessment in which participants are asked to describe 
“what is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]” in their words. Participants will provide their answers on paper. These 
brief writings will be analyzed using thematic content analysis.  
 
B. Description of Population to be Enrolled :   
The target population are African American adults who are [ADDRESS_250862] be English speaking and self -identify as African American.  
 
C. Study Design and Research Methods    
Study Design: The study employs a two phase pre- /post -test intervention design or a small 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_209911] (RCT), utilizing a one- to-one randomization scheme. Participants 
will be randomized into groups after completing the baseline assessments. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_209912] a new intervention, as well as the feasibility of implementing a new intervention.
[ADDRESS_250863] the efficacy of a paper and video decision 
aid for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677]. The intervention group will receive both decisi on aids and the control 
group will receive no intervention. All participants will receive the intervention materials at the conclusion of the study regardless of intervention group.  
 
Study Setting:  Recruitment will take place at community organizations ser ving older African 
Americans  and the outpatient primary care clinics for both UCHealth and Denver Health.  
 
Recruitment:  The target enrollment is 150 total (75 per arm) participants.  
 
• Community Organizations -will consist of passive recruitment via flyers, listservs, 
electronic mailing mechanisms and advertisements in newsletters  and newspapers .  
Protocol Template  Page 4 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 • Outpatient Clinics - potential patients will be identified through weekly chart reviews. The 
study team will communicate with the outpatient physician by [CONTACT_5657]/her preferred 
communication method (e.g. email, phone) to determine whether the patients are 
appropriate to be approached. If eligible and appropriate, a research team member will 
approach the patient and introduce the study following their clinical encounter. Fl yers will 
also be hung in treatment rooms and common areas of each clinic. Reasons for non-
approach will be recorded.  
o Email/Mailings -We will also review medical records for potentially eligible patients 
and send them either an email or letter via US mail describing the study and 
asking them to contact [CONTACT_209941].  
 
Research Methods: This will be a 1:1 intervention:control  randomization scheme.  
• Baseline Visit (Aim 1) - All participants will com plete the baseline measurements:  brief 
writing exercise , the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209913], Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209914] 
(HBAS), and decision self -efficacy scale  (all measurements described above). Additionally, 
all participants will be asked to briefly describe in writing “what is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]” in their own 
words. Prior research shows this brief writing exercise exposes many of the 
misconceptions of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209915] .37 A trained research assistant will be available to answer questions and provide 
clarification if necessary. Additionally, the participants’ preferred method of contact [CONTACT_209942] -up visit (Aim2) . After completion of baseline 
surveys, participants will be randomized for Aim 2 of the study.  
• Follow -up Visits (Aim 2 ) - Participants  randomized to the intervention group will be asked 
to review the PtDA s within 1 week of the baseline visit. Each participant will be contact[CONTACT_209943] 1 visit to complete follow -up assessments by [CONTACT_648]. All 
participants, regardless of study arm, will be called 1- month after the baseline  visit to 
complete the follow -up surveys by [CONTACT_648]. The contr ol and intervention groups will 
complete the primary outcomes surveys (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209916], decision self-efficacy & 
HBAS). The proposed intervention and follow -up are consistent with other shared decision 
making and PtDA studies .26 
Data collection:  For patients who agree to participate, the study coordinator will collect baseline 
demographic and quantitative data (surveys described above in Section A). The r esearch 
coordinator will then open the envelope to determine the patient’s allocation. Control patients will be asked to complete the baseline measures at time of enrollment and again at 1- month follow -up. 
Intervention patients will be given the decision aid and asked to review it within the next week . 
Then the best way to contact [CONTACT_209944] -up calls will be recorded. Finally, each 
participant (control and intervention) will be contact[CONTACT_209945]. $25 gift cards will be given for baseline and one- month follow -up surveys.    
 
• Baseline visit (control & Intervention)-  All participants will be asked to complete the brief 
writing exercise, REALM test, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209917], Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209918], Decision Self -efficacy scale, and demographics.  
• One Week Follow -up call (intervention only)- Participants will be asked to complete the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209917], Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_209919],  Decision  Self-efficacy 
scale , the decision aid acceptability scale and brief decision aid feasibility questionnaire.   
• One Month Follow -up (control & intervention)- At one month follow -up all participants 
will be asked to complete the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209917], Hosp ice Beliefs and Attitudes 
Scale, and the Decision Self -efficacy scale.  
 
D.   Description, Risks and Justification of Proc edures and Data Collection Tools: 
This project poses minimal risk to all subjects involved. The intervention involves review of 
decisional support materials and a series of quantitative and qualitative questions.  Data 
collection from participants includes questions and medical record review to screen for eligibility and only limited demographic data will be obtained. There is always a risk t hat 
Protocol Template  Page 5 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 participants may feel uncomfortable discussing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209920]- of-life decisions. Participants 
will be informed of their right to refuse to answer any question they do not wish to answer, and 
may terminate participation in the study at any point (and th at should they decline to 
participate, answer a question or withdraw this will not affect their medical care).   
 
Data collection and storage has been planned to appropriately protect participant 
confidentiality. All patients will be given a unique identifi cation number, and study data and 
identifiable information will always be kept separate. REDCap, the COMIRB -preferred system, 
will be used to store all s urvey and enrollment data, and access to both REDCap and the 
secure server will be limited to study per sonnel only. All paper documents will be stored in a 
secure and locked file cabinet in a secure and locked office building –  again, all study data 
paperwork will be stored separate from paperwork with identifiable information (i.e. signed consent forms) and be accessible to study personnel only.  
     
E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
Will participants with low health literacy/numeracy be able to understand decision aid (DA)?  
A key challenge in DA research is assuring that the resultant products are acc essible to all 
populations. Because most DAs require a minimum level of education, they risk widening 
disparities by [CONTACT_209946]. The DA has been developed in 
accordance with recommendations for clear communication. The current protocol is limited to 
English speaking and reading participants. In this first stage of intervention assessment we are limited to an English version of the DA since there is currently no staff with credentials to conduct health language translation in Spanish, Amharic, Congolese, Mandarin, Arabic, etc. 
Upon successful evaluation of this protocol, discussions for DA translation will be conducted.  
 
F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
Qualitative Analysis - The open- ended qualitative question will be analyzed using inductive and 
deductive content analysis .39-41 The deductive approach will identify participant knowledge of 
key domains of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]. The inductive approach will identify any key misconceptions or fallacies expressed by  [CONTACT_81260]. All qualitative analysis will be done with 
Atlas.ti. 8.0 (GmbH, Berlin).  
 
Quant itative Analysis -We will compare differences between intervention and control pre/post 
intervention using t -tests for continuous outcomes and chi -square tests for dichotomous 
outcomes. We will perform a multivariate analysis of our outcome variables (i.e. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209895], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209921]) and look for mediation and/or moderation 
effects of  level medical mistrust, level of perceive d discrimination (schedule of racist events) 
age, race, and gender; while controlling for potential confounders.

G.  Summarize Knowledge to be  Gained:   
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209922]. The proposed research aims to specifically target older African 
Americans who are especially vulnerable to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209923]. The decisional support materials used in the proposed research will provide valuable insights 
into issues and barriers that prevent African Americans from enrolling in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209924] a salient means  to improve hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209925]. This study is designed to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_209926] a planned multi -site RO1 addressing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209927] 6

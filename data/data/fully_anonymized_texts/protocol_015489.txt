.0 Introduction 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a life saving therapy for 
patients with hematopoietic malignancies. The ability of HSCT to control an underlying 
hematologic malignancy is based on three variables, the intrinsic sensitivity/resistance 
of the malignancy, treatment regimen intensity, and graft versus tumor effects.  
Transplantation was initially developed as a treatment in patients with resistant 
leukemia. While the approach achieved short term control in many patients, relapse 
remained a problem in this patient group such that only 10-20% of patients became long 
term disease free survivors using matched sibling donors. Even today, long term 
disease free survival in patients with active leukemia at the time of transplant as 
reported by [CONTACT_186846] 20%. In contrast, patients transplanted in 
remission for similar diseases with identical conditioning regimens may achieve long 
term survivals of greater than 60%. Treatment intensity is near maximal in most 
transplant regimens. Higher doses of TBI or chemotherapy are associated with lower 
incidences of relapse, but usually at the price of more regimen related toxicity which 
limits overall gains in outcome. Disease sensitivity/resistance is not something that can 
be changed when patients present for treatment, and transplant regimen intensity can 
be further increased only over a narrow additional range. Consequently, it is difficult to 
manipulate these variables to effect substantial improvements in this group of high risk 
HSCT candidates. Graft versus tumor (GVT) effects may thus be the only variable 
which can be manipulated to address this problem.   
 
It is now understood that, in some diseases, a GVT effect, not regimen intensity, is the 
primary mechanism for long-term disease control after allogeneic transplantation. In 
other diseases, both treatment intensity and GVT effects contribute to disease 
eradication. This principle has been firmly established by [CONTACT_186847], the success of reduced intensity HSCT1 and disease 
eradication after donor lymphocyte infusions.[ADDRESS_220764]. As demonstrated in Table 1, the outcomes reported in several trials for 
patients in this category are dismal with overall survival (OS) rates consistently less 
than 30% for all the trials, and below 25% in many.

CR @ [ADDRESS_220768] shown much 
higher relapse rates than transplants from HLA identical siblings. The twin is 
presumably unable to mount a stronger GVT response than the patient him/herself. 
Conversely, unrelated donor (URD) transplants tend to have lower relapse rates than 
transplants from matched sibling donors because of the greater mismatching of non-
inherited antigens. While HLA antigens and alleles can be matched for in URD HSCT, 
there is a much greater probability of minor histocompatibility (mHAg) and killer 
inhibitory receptor (KIR) mismatching resulting in greater recognition of non-self19 by [CONTACT_186848]. Unfortunately, only about one in three patients will have an available well-
matched unrelated donor and for many non Caucasians, the odds of finding a well-
matched unrelated donor are considerably worse.   
 
HLA mismatching associated with haploidentical HSCT has been shown to potentiate 
graft versus tumor (GVT) effects because of the high degree of mismatch involved in 
this type of transplant. It has been demonstrated that the graft versus tumor effects 
associated with haploidentical HSCT are more potent than those from matched sibling 
HSCT.20-[ADDRESS_220769] 
because it is not limited by [CONTACT_98680]/ethnic HLA diversity. Thus haploidentical HSCT 
enfranchises segments of the population such as individuals of mixed racial ancestry as 
well as African Americans who, because of a higher degree of HLA diversity, are often 
without a well matched donor. Unfortunately, haploidentical HSCT has traditionally been 
associated with higher mortality rates as compared to transplants from well matched 
donors, limiting its application. The primary approach to haploidentical BMT has been to 
rigorously T cell deplete the graft to avoid severe GVHD. T-cell depletion techniques 
have been successful in decreasing GVHD, but higher rates of relapse, graft rejectio n 
and opportunistic infection (OI) due to the lack of T cells in the donor inoculum have 
resulted in increased mortality.23,[ADDRESS_220770] been achieved with 
large doses of rigorously CD34 selected HSC by [CONTACT_186849],25 but their 
approach has not lent itself to widespread adoption at other centers. Additionally, 
relapse rates and treatment related mortality in patients entering transplant with active 
malignancy remain high using this approach.   
 
In recent years, administration of cyclophosphamide (CY) after a T replete (ie non T cell 
depleted) marrow graft in order to preferentially eliminate proliferating alloreactive T 
cells has been successfully utilized in non-myeloablative haploidentical HSCT.26, 27 With 
this approach, patients avoid profound immunoincompetence due to the remaining 
donor T cells which, because they are not alloreactive and proliferating early after 
transplant, are less affected by [CONTACT_3962]. While promising, this approach does not allow one 
to separately control the T cell and stem cell content of the transplant, as the T cells 
represent a varying number of passenger cells in the graft. In addition, depending on 
the patient’s age or disease at the time of transplant, a reduced intensity regimen is not 
always an optimal treatment strategy. An approach to myeloablative haploidentical BMT 
with low non relapse mortality serves as an ideal platform to explore the GVT effects 
associated with haploidentical HSCT.

[ADDRESS_220771] successfully applied to patients with hematologic 
malignancies.  We refer to this as a 2-step approach because the lymphoid and stem 
cell portions of the graft are collected and administered at different time points during 
the conditioning regimen. Our approach does not involve ex vivo T cell depletion, but 
uses CY to tolerize donor lymphocytes. The separation of the myeloid and lymphoid 
portions of the graft allows us to use a fixed dose of donor T cells creating a consistent 
platform from which to compare outcomes. We believe this approach fulfills the need for 
an approach to explore GVT effects in a setting where regimen-related mortality is 
acceptable. 
 
In the initial 2 step trial (IRB #06U.20, 2006-2009), we used TBI (1.5 Gray x 8) and CY 
(60 mg/kg x 2) for conditioning. Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) were 
used as post transplant immunosuppression in a relatively standard fashion. The 
treatment schema is below.

As illustrated in the treatment schema above, donor lymphocytes infusions (DLI) 
containing a fixed dose of donor T cells, were given after the final fraction of TBI on day 
-6. In the phase I portion of the trial, the dose of T cells which resulted in consistent 
engraftment and the avoidance of severe GVHD was 2 x 108/kg. This dose given to all 
patients in the trial as well as all of the subsequent patients treated on [ADDRESS_220774] to a TH2 phenotype. We found that 
donors tolerated the aphereses without appreciable toxicity.   
 
In this approach, T cells in the HSC portion of the graft are not exposed to CY and thus 
are potentially alloreactive.  Our goal was to administer a CD34+ cell dose of  2-
10x10e6/kg and a CD3+ cell dose of <5x10e4/kg. To minimize T cell content, the HSC 
portion of the graft was CD34 selected, using the Isolex device (Baxter). After CD34 
selection, we incubated the CD34 cells in OKT3 and then washed out any unbound 
antibody. The goal was to coat any residual T cells with OKT3 which would lead to their 
lysis in vivo after infusion, but to avoid infusing free OKT3 which would compromise the 
T cells which had been rendered tolerant by [CONTACT_3962].   
 
1.1.1  Results of Our Initial Trial 
Patient Population: Between 2006 and 2009 twenty-seven patients, median age of 52 
years (range 19-67), with high risk hematological malignancies were transplanted from 
haploidentical donors that were mismatched for HLA-A, B, C, and DR in the GVHD 
direction at 4 antigens (13), 3 antigens (11), and 2 antigens (2). One patient had no 
mismatches in the GVHD direction but was a 3 antigen mismatch in the rejection 
direction due to HLA homozygocity. It was subsequently decided that patients with 
mismatches only in the HVG direction should be treated on our matched related rather 
than haploidentical trial (ie that we would consider matching status from the GVH, not 
HVG perspective). Consequently, the study was amended to add one additional patient 
to the study group such that 27 patients were treated, rather than the initially planned 
26. Diagnoses included MDS (n=2), AML (n=16), ALL (n=4), Biphenotypic Leukemia 
(n=1), CLL/Richter’s (n=1), NHL (n=2), and Aplastic Anemia (n=1). Fifteen of 27 patients 
(56%) had evidence of persistent disease at the time of transplant. All 27 had some high 
risk feature including high risk cytogenetics, secondary leukemia, progressive disease, 
or second or greater remission.   
 
Results: All patients are currently at least [ADDRESS_220775] been no 
changes in DFS or OS since 2009. In this group, there were no deaths from GVHD and 
the cumulative incidence of grade III-IV GVHD was only 7.4%. Only 16% of patients 
developed chronic GVHD, and in all cases it was mild (NIH consensus criteria score of 
1).   
 
Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 22.6% with 3 deaths from 
infection and 3 deaths from regimen-related toxicity. Engraftment was consistent with 
this approach. Two patients experienced graft failure and died from complications of 
undergoing two condition regimens in close succession in a second engraftment 
attempt. These patients account for 2 of the 3 patients that died of regimen-related 
toxicity. The graft failures occurred in maternal recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186824]/donors’ HLA antigens. The risk of rejection based on HLA antibodies in the 
myeloablative setting was not widely recognized at the time of this trial. In patients

[ADDRESS_220795] few days after infusion. As a result, 
a smaller percentage of GVT T cells will be activated early on, and, consequently, fewer 
GVT T cells are likely to be eliminated by [CONTACT_186850] (Figure 5). As the tumor burden progressively increases, more and 
more GVT reactive T cells will encounter tumor cells during the first few days after 
infusion, thus becoming activated and subsequently eliminated by [CONTACT_186851]. The 
larger the tumor burden at the time of lymphocyte administration, the more the potential 
of CY to blunt the GVT 
effect, ultimately 
eliminating any 
differential impact 
compared to GVHD 
which may occur in 
remission patients. One 
simple solution to this 
problem would be to 
administer the T 
Cells closer to the true 
tumor nadir following the

chemoradiotherapy.  
 
Currently, the DLI, 
containing 2 x 108/kg T 
cells, is administered immediately after the last fraction of radiation. In this proposed 
trial, we will administer the T cells two days after radiation ends. This will allow a longer 
time period for tumor cells and antigen presenting cells capable of presenting tumor 
antigens to die off prior to the infusion of the DLI. Our hypothesis is that after the 
infusion, less donor GVT reactive T cells will become activated due to the reduction of 
these recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186825], and by [CONTACT_66250], less 
GVT reactive donor T cells will be vulnerable to subsequent eradication by [CONTACT_3962].

We also note that patients with lymphoma will be treated on this protocol. While most of 
these patients do not have marrow based involvement of their malignancy, the 
additional time between the radiation and the donor GVT reactive T cell infusion will 
allow tumor cells in the lymph nodes as well as antigen presenting cells capable of 
presenting tumor antigens, to die off. As with marrow based disease scenarios, the 
activation and subsequent elimination by [CONTACT_186853] T cells will also be 
avoided. The only difference is that the primary location of the malignant disease is 
different.

.3 Donor Lymphocyte Infusions 
The dose of the donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) will be based on CD3+ T cells per 
kilogram of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148]. T-cell and progenitor cell doses and 
cyclophosphamide dosing will be based on adjusted dosing weight (40% the difference 
between actual and ideal body weight + the actual body weight). The donor T-cells will 
be collected prior to the use of G-CSF for progenitor cell collection.   
 
DLI specimen handling and labeling conventions will be performed in accord with the 
relevant AABB (American Association of Blood Banks) and/or FACT (Foundation for 
Accreditation for Cell Therapy) regulations and guidelines. All DLI specimens must be 
appropriately labeled in accord with these standards to be accepted by [CONTACT_186856]. A valid prescription and request form must be submitted by [CONTACT_186857].  
 
The following guidelines should be used to calculate the correct volume of blood to be 
obtained from the donor to achieve the target T-cell dose.  
 
An aliquot of the apheresis product will be assessed for CD3 content by [CONTACT_4133]. 
The following cell panel will be used:  
FITC  PE  
IgG1  IgG1  
IgG1  IgG2a

CD4  CD8  
CD4 CD25+ FoxP3+  
 
A gate is drawn around the entire CD45+ population. %WBC/total events = the 
percentage of CD45+ cells within this gate corrected for the isotype control. CD3 
percentages are calculated, corrected for the isotype control, based on the total white 
cell (CD45+) gate, not based on a “lymphocyte gate”. There are 4 CD3 counts 
performed in the panel. The two median values are averaged to determine the final raw 
CD3 count. The raw CD3 count is then corrected for any counted events which are not 
WBC (i.e. CD45-), as follows:  
 
Corrected %CD3 = (raw CD3 count)/(%WBC/total events).

All donors will report for apheresis of lymphocytes the day before the planned DLI. If the 
targeted amount of lymphocytes is not collected on the first day, the donor will return for 
a second day of lymphocyte collection on the day of the DLI. 
 
Lymphocyte apheresis will be performed at Thomas Jefferson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186827], by [CONTACT_186858]. No 
hematopoietic growth factors will be administered to apheresis donors prior to 
lymphocyte collection. The donor will have venous catheters placed in each arm for the 
purposes of undergoing leukopheresis. Leukocyte collections will be performed using a 
standard apheresis machine such as the Cobe Spectra apheresis instrument (Cobe 
Laboratories Inc., Lakewood, CO).  
 
For the donor lymphocyte apheresis, total blood volumes to be processed will be 
determined using the following calculation: 
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186828]:                    __________kg 
Multiply by [CONTACT_186859]3+ cells/kg:  x __________x10(7)/kg

d by 100 x 10(&) TMC/L        = _____ Liters processed 
 
During the infusion of the DLI, the patient will be monitored for any untoward reactions. 
Each infusion will take place in the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit. Donor lymphocyte 
infusions will be administered by [CONTACT_186860].  
 
5.3.1 DLI Dosing 
2 x 10e8/kg donor T cells will be collected from a single donor and infused

.4 Cyclophosphamide 
CY 60 mg/kg IV over 2 hours will be administered on days –3 and –2 of the conditioning 
regimen. Mesna 60 mg/kg continuous IV infusion over 24 hours X 2 doses will be 
administered on days –3 and -2. Day –[ADDRESS_220812]. 
 
Voriconazole can block the conversion of CY to its active metabolite, 4-
hydroxycyclophosphamide. For this reason, no voriconazole will be administered 
to any patient from admission (or the beginning of conditioning) until day -1.  
Voriconazole may be started on day -1.  
 
The data39 regarding Posaconazole, a newer drug is unclear in this regard. 
Therefore, like voriconazole, no posaconazole will be administered to any patient 
from admission (or the beginning of conditioning) until day -1.  Posaconazole 
may be started on day - 1. 
 
There are no restrictions on the use of liposomal amphotericin.  
 
5.5 Collection and Infusion of Progenitor Cells 
Donors will begin G-CSF, 5µg/kg bid, on day -5, and will return for neupogen-primed 
progenitor cell collection on days -2 and -1. Each day, 18-27 liters will be processe d. 
 
5.5.1 CD 34+ Cell Doses 
The target dose of donor PBSCs to be infused into the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186829] 3 –5 x 106 
CD34 cells/kg of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186830]. The acceptable minimum infusion target 
of PBSCs will be 1 x 106 CD34 cells/kg. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186831] 10 x 106 
CD34 cells/kg, the maximum dose. If less than 50% of the minimum acceptable CD34 
cells/kg target dose is obtained after the first collection, one dose of Plerixafor,  0.24 
mg/kg (donor actual body weight), may be administered subcutaneously the evening 
prior to the second collection. Because the meaningful dose of T cells has already been 
collected and infused by [CONTACT_159753], Plerixafor would not have polarization effects on T 
helper cells. A third day of collection may be performed to meet the minimum cell 
requirements.  
 
Progenitor cell apheresis will be performed at Thomas Jefferson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186832], by [CONTACT_186858]. 
The donor will have venous catheters placed in each arm or an apheresis catheter for 
the purposes of undergoing leukopheresis. Leukocyte collections will be performed 
using a standard apheresis machine such as the Cobe Spectra apheresis instrument 
(Cobe Laboratories Inc., Lakewood, CO).  
 
Handling and labeling of the progenitor cell product will be performed in accord with the 
relevant AABB (American Association of Blood Banks) and/or FACT (Foundation for 
Accreditation for Cell Therapy) regulations and guidelines. All donor specimens must be 
appropriately labeled in accord with these standards to be accepted by [CONTACT_186856]. A valid prescription and request form must be submitted by [CONTACT_186857].

CD
34+ cell enrichment will be performed via the closed system method using the 
CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). The CliniMACS 
system utilizes super-paramagnetic particles composed of iron oxide and dextran 
conjugated to monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies bind to target cells with the 
corresponding cell surface antigen (in this case, CD34). After magnetic labeling, the 
cells are separated using a high-gradient magnetic separation column. The magnetically 
labeled cells are retained in the column and separated from the unlabeled cells. 
Removing the magnetic field from the separation column elutes the retained cells. 
Eluted cells will be characterized using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) 
analysis. All procedures will be performed in a sterile environment with strict adherence 
to all applicable regulations regarding the processing and use of human stem cells. The 
use of this device will conform to TJU BMT Laboratory standard operating procedures. 
 
In our experience, the ideal amount of T-cells left in the PBSC product is no greater 
than 5x104/kg, so that every effort will be made to keep T-cell amounts to below this 
threshold. It is recognized that because of donor heterogeneity, every product will have 
varying percentages of cells. Thus, patients will be advised during the informed consent 
process that an excess amount of residual T-lymphocytes in the PBSC product may 
increase the risk of GVHD.  
 
The donor product is infused UNFILTERED or through a filter of at least [ADDRESS_220813] operating procedure, CL: Ppp040.05, of the Thomas Jefferson 
University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186833].  Pre-medications (if 
any) prior to marrow infusion will be at the discretion of the physician.  
 
5.6 GVHD Prophylaxis 
Tacrolimus and MMF will be started on day -1. The day -1 tacrolimus dose is a loading 
dose and will be 0.03 mg/kg IV in a divided dose whether the patient is on voriconazole 
or posaconazole. Starting on day 0, tacrolimus will be maintained at a dose of 0.015 
mg/kg in divided doses IV if given simultaneously with voriconazole or posaconazole.  If 
the patient is not receiving voriconazole or posaconazole, the dose of tacrolimus will 
remain at 0.03 mg/kg in divided doses IV. Tacrolimus levels will be checked daily

rting on day 0. Tacrolimus dosing should be titrated to maintain a target level of 
8ng/ml +/- 2.  
 
MMF will be dosed at [ADDRESS_220814] 2 to 3 days prior to discharge. This is to 
assure that stable, therapeutic levels are reached on oral drug prior to discharge.   
 
MMF will be discontinued beginning at day +28 +/- 3 days in the absence of GVHD.  
MMF may be discontinued earlier if there is count suppression thought to be due to the 
drug. Do not wean MMF. MMF is not tapered. 
 
The tacrolimus taper should be initiated by [CONTACT_4475] + [ADDRESS_220815] at roughly 15% per week (range 10 to 20% per week). Once tacrolimus 
levels are less that 5 ng/ml levels, they no longer have to be checked unless there is a 
clinical concern to do so. Because of the variability in patient outpatient office visit times 
and the need for GVHD assessment, it is not mandatory that the taper begins exactly 
day +42, but should begin within 2 weeks of day 42. 
 
5.6.1 Treatment of Patients with Acute GVHD 
The following steps will be taken if GVHD is suspected: 
 Begin prednisone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day (1mg/kg q12h).  As soon as 
manifestations show clear cut evidence of improvement usually 2-3 days after 
initiation of therapy (and  not to be interpreted as complete resolution of all 
manifestations ) reduce the prednisone dose to 1 mg/kg/day (0.5 mg/kg q12h).  
Thereafter, taper by 20 mg/dose every [ADDRESS_220816] 
weekly as an outpatient until a 20 mg daily dose is reached. 
 If patients were on Tacrolimus and/or MMF, they may remain on these 
mediations to facilitate weaning the steroids. If these medications had been 
discontinued, they should be restarted only if the patient fails to respond to 
steroids.   
 Once prednisone is at 20 mg per day or lower, it may be preferable to taper 
tacrolimus or discontinue MMF while holding prednisone at the current dose as 
these other medications may represent a more substantial burden of 
immunosuppression for the patient at these low prednisone doses. Alternatively, 
one can complete the steroid wean over another 2-4 weeks. 
 In the absence of GVHD flare, begin weaning Tacrolimus or discontinue MMF 
two weeks after the prior medication has been stopped (or immediately after the 
steroid taper has been paused at a dose of 20 mg/day of prednisone or less.   
 If patients flare on this sort of taper, medications should be increased to at least 
the prior dose which achieved control and photopheresis should be initiated 2- 3 
times per week for patients with skin disease. Efforts should be made to begin a 
taper again after 2 weeks of photopheresis.   
 This taper reflects a guide as to the slowest, not the fastest, that immune 
suppression should be tapered.  The pace should be accelerated in patients with 
significant bacterial, viral, fungal, or other infections. The goal is to find which

6.0 Laboratory Studies/Outcome Assessment 
6.1 Analyses of Leukemia MHC Gene Content and Expression 
Since the majority of these patients will be transplanted in relapse, it is permissible, but 
not mandatory, to obtain and cryopreserve buccal swabs, blood and/or marrow 
specimens prior to transplant and at the time of relapse if relapse occurs. Specimens 
will be analyzed using pan-HLA class I and pan-HLA class II antibodies to assess 
whether overall levels of MHC molecules have declined on the cells surface. Genetic 
analysis including sequencing of these paired specimens will allow us to assess 
whether asymmetric loss of one haplotype, such as from uniparental disomy, occurs 
after transplant on this regimen.  
 
In addition to the above studies, SNP or other genetic analyses can be performed in the 
matched pair samples as hypotheses are generated to test for other mechanisms 
through which leukemia cells escape GVT.

8.0 Drug Information and Administration 
8.1 Cyclophosphamide 
Mechanism: A multistep process activates it by [CONTACT_186863] 4-
hydroxycyclophosphamide by [CONTACT_186864].  Aldophosphamide 
spontaneously degrades into acrolein and phosporamide mustard, which cause cellular 
glutathione depletion and DNA alkylation. This results in inhibition of DNA replication 
and transcription. Cells expressing high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (e.g. stem 
cells, L1210 leukemia cells) resist cyclophosphamide-mediated cytotoxicity as 
aldophosphamide is inactivated by [CONTACT_75107]. The drug also does not affect quiescent 
cells and therefore stem cells are generally protected, an important factor if autologous 
hematopoietic recovery is relied on in the event of graft failure.

December 22, 2015 
Version 2.3 Metabolism: Cyclophosphamide is broken down as described above and the break 
down products are excreted by [CONTACT_8212]. It is a substrate of CYP2A6 (minor), 
CYP2B6 (major), CYP2C19 (minor), CYP2C9 (minor), CYP3A4 (minor); Note: 
Assignment of Major/Minor substrate status based on clinically relevant drug interaction 
potential; Inhibits CYP3A4 (weak); Induces CYP2B6 (weak/moderate), CYP2C9 
(weak/moderate). 
 
Incompatibilities: Phenobarbital  or rifampin  may increase the toxicity of 
cyclophosphamide. Concurrent allopurinol  or thiazide diuretics  may exaggerate bone 
marrow depression may prolong neuromuscular blockade from succinylcholine  
Cardiotoxicity may be additive with other cardiotoxic agents ( cytarabine , daunorubicin , 
doxorubicin). May decrease serum digoxin  levels. Additive bone marrow depression 
with other antineoplastics or radiation therapy. May potentiate the effects of warfarin . 
May decrease antibody response to live-virus vaccines and increase the risk of adverse 
reactions. Prolongs the effects of cocaine. 
 
Toxicity: Nausea, vomiting, water retention due to inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic 
hormone (SIADH), cardiomyopathy with myocardial necrosis and congestive heart 
failure, hemorrhagic cystitis, alopecia, skin rash, pulmonary fibrosis, sterility and 
secondary malignancies. 
 
Administration: Patients will receive a dose of cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg IV, on days 
–3 and -2. The dose of cyclophosphamide will be calculated according to the dosing 
body weight. The cyclophosphamide dose is dissolved in saline and administered as a 2 
hour IV infusion. Patients shall receive hydration consisting of normal saline solution at 
3 ml/kg/hour (actual weight) for 2 hours before and 8 hours after the cyclophosphamide 
infusion. MESNA (sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) will be administered as a 60 
mg/kg/continuous IV infusion over [ADDRESS_220828] dose of 
cyclophosphamide. The dose of MESNA will also be calculated based on dosing body 
weight.

8.2 Donor Leukocyte Infusion (DLI) 
Administration: All patients will receive a dose of CD3+ T cells per kilogram of dosing 
body weight as outlined in the treatment design. Details of the apheresis procedure to 
obtain white blood cells, quantification of T cells by [CONTACT_4133], and administration of 
the white cell product to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186837]. All drugs 
that may cause lymphocyte suppression are held prior to lymphocyte infusion (day -6), 
through day [ADDRESS_220829] fraction of TBI as described in 
section 5.0. Moreover the viability of the lymphocytes will be tested by [CONTACT_186865]3+ T cells will be used to dose the DLI.  
 
Toxicity: GVHD, delayed myelosuppression, infusion reactions. 
 
8.3 G-CSF  
Mechanism: G-CSF is a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor produced by 
[CONTACT_12060]. It is a glycoprotein which acts on hematopoietic cells by 
[CONTACT_186866], differentiation, 
commitment, and some end-cell functions. Activates neutrophils to increase migration 
andtoxicity. 
 
Metabolism: Absorption and clearance of G-CSF follows first-order pharmacokinetic 
modeling without apparent concentration dependence. The elimination half-life in both 
normal and cancer patients is 3.5 hours.   
 
Incompatibilities: Safety and efficacy of G-CSF when used simultaneously with 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy has not been evaluated. Donors receiving either of these 
2 modalities will not be permitted on study. 
 
Toxicities: Allergic reactions consisting of rash, wheezing and tachycardia.  Splenic 
rupture, ARDS, and exacerbation of sickle cell disease have been reported rarely. 
 
Adminstration: In this protocol, G-CSF will be administered to healthy donors at a dose 
of 10 µg/kg (actual weight) subcutaneously on days -5 through day - 1.

8.4 GM-CSF (Sargramostim, Leukine) 
Mechanism:  GM-CSF is a recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 
produced by [CONTACT_94988] a yeast expression system. It supports 
survival, clonal expansion, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. GM-CSF is also 
capable of activating mature granulocytes and macrophages, and is a multilineage 
factor with effects on the myelomonocytic, erythroid, and megarkaryocytic lines.  
 
Metabolism: GM-CSF is detected in the serum at [ADDRESS_220830] for Patients with High Risk Disease 
Kimmel Cancer Center 
30 
December 22, 2015 
Version 2.3 Incompatibilities: Interactions between GM-CSF and other drugs have not been fully 
evaluated. Drugs which may potentiate the myeloproliferative effects of GM-CSF, such 
as lithium and corticosteroids, should be used with caution.  
 
Toxicities: Allergic and anaphylactic reactions have been reported. A syndrome 
characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1506], hypoxia, flushing, hypotension, syncope and or 
tachycardia has been associated with the first administration of GM-CSF in a cycle.  
These signs have resolved with treatment.  
 
Administration: In this protocol, GM-CSF will be given to the patients beginning on Day 
+1. The drug should continue until the patient has a self-sustaining ANC of ≥ 1000.

8.5 Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 
Mechanism:  Inhibits the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is 
involved in purine synthesis. This inhibition results in suppression of T- and B-
lymphocyte proliferation.  
 
Metabolism: Following oral and IV administration, mycophenolate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186838] (MPA), its active metabolite. Distribution is unknown. MPA is 
extensively metabolized; <1% excreted unchanged in urine. Some enterohepatic 
recirculation of MPA occurs. Half Life: MPA ¾17.9 hr. 
 
Incompatibilities: Combined use with azathioprine is not recommended (effects 
unknown) .  Acyclovir and ganciclovir compete with MPA for renal excretion and, in 
patients with renal failure, may increase each other's toxicity. Magnesium and aluminum 
hydroxide antacids decrease the absorption of MPA (avoid simultaneous 
administration). Cholestyramine and colestipol decrease the absorption of MPA (avoid 
concurrent use). Toxicity may be increased by [CONTACT_186867]. May interfere with the action 
of oral contraceptives (additional contraceptive method should be used). May decrease 
the antibody response to and increase risk of adverse reactions from live-virus 
vaccines, although influenza vaccine may be useful. When administered with food, peak 
blood levels of MPA are significantly decreased. 
 
Toxicities: GI: Bleeding, Diarrhea, Vomiting, Hematopoietic: Leukopenia Miscellaneous: 
Sepsis, Increased Risk of Malignancy  
 
Administration: In this protocol, MMF will be administered at a dose of 1 gram IV BID 
beginning on day -1. MMF will be discontinued on day +[ADDRESS_220831] for Patients with High Risk Disease

8.6 Tacrolimus 
Mechanism: Tacrolimus, it is a macrolide immunosuppressant. It inhibits lymphocytes 
by [CONTACT_12789] a complex with FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin leading to the decrease in the 
phosphatase activity of calcineurin. This in turn prevents generation of NF-AT, a nuclear 
factor for initiating gene transcription for lymphokines like interleukin-2 and interferon 
gamma. This drug is used with corticosteroids for prophylaxis of organ rejection in 
patients receiving allogeneic liver transplants. Its use is also currently being investigated 
in kidney, bone marrow, cardiac, pancreas, pancreatic island cell and small bowel 
transplantation.  
 
Metabolism: This drug is well absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver by [CONTACT_186868] n 
mechanisms and demethylation and hydroxylation has been proposed based on in vitro  
studies. The metabolized products are excreted in the urine. Tacrolimus is a substrate 
of CYP3A4 (major), P-glycoprotein; Note: Assignment of Major/Minor substrate status 
based on clinically relevant drug interaction potential; Inhibits CYP3A4 (weak), P-
glycoprotein.  
 
Imcopabilities: Nephrotoxic drugs, antifungals (azoles), calcium-channel blockers, 
cimetidine, danazol, erythromycin, methylprednisone and metoclopramide increase the 
bioavailabilty of tacrolimus. On the other hand phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifamycins and 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_186839].  
 
Toxicities: Adverse reactions include: tremor, headache, neurotoxicity; diarrhea, 
nausea; hypertension; TTP and renal dysfunction.     
 
Administration: Tacrolimus will be started on day -1. The day -1 tacrolimus dose is a 
loading dose and will be 0.03 mg/kg IV in a divided dose whether the patient is on 
voriconazole or posaconazole. Starting on day 0, tacrolimus will be maintained at a 
dose of 0.015 mg/kg in divided doses IV if given simultaneously with voriconazole or 
posaconazole. If the patient is not receiving voriconazole or posaconazole, the dose of 
tacrolimus will remain at 0.03 mg/kg in divided doses IV. Tacrolimus dosing should be 
based on levels due to numerous drug interactions such as with antidepressants 
(Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor/Antagonist). Tacrolimus levels will be checked daily 
starting on day 0. Tacrolimus dosing should be titrated to maintain a target level of 
7ng/ml +/- 2. The tacrolimus wean will be initiated by [CONTACT_4475] +42 in the absence of GVHD.

Version 2.3  
T
he study will be monitored on an ongoing fashion by [CONTACT_079] (PI) and 
the study medical monitor.  Monitoring reports will be submitted to the Clinical Research 
Management Office (CRMO) for review by [CONTACT_186869].  
Adverse events and a report summarizing their impact on the conduct of the trial are 
submitted to the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC) quarterly, and the 
DSMC reports are then submitted to the CCRRC and IRB annually. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_186840] (SAE) to the TJU IRB utilizing the electronic Kimmel Cancer 
Center Clinical Trials Adverse Event Reporting system. Due to the nature of the study 
treatment as outlined in this protocol, expected grade 3 AE/SAEs that occur while 
receiving standard inpatient protocol treatment may be included on the patient’s AE log 
for quarterly review by [CONTACT_186870].  It is the responsibility of the study Principal Investigator (PI) to report any 
grade 3 AE/SAE to the DSMC per the DSM Plan should the length of standard protocol 
treatment hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186841]/or the grade 3 AE/SAE is more acute than 
expected as outlined in the informed consent form. Unexpected deaths related to this 
protocol will be reported within 24 hours. 
 
The medical monitor will be a TJU physician who is not a collaborator in this trial. The 
medical monitor will review all adverse events (in addition to unexpected adverse 
events), safety data and activity data observed when this trial is ongoing. The medical 
monitor may recommend reporting adverse events and relevant safety data not 
previously reported, and may recommend suspension or termination of the trial. The 
summary of all discussions of adverse events will be submitted to the DSMC after 
completion and included in the PI's reports to the CCRRC and the TJU IRB as part of 
the study progress report. The CCRRC, DMSC, and/or the TJU IRB may, based on the 
monitor's recommendation suspend or terminate of the trial. The quarterly safety and 
monitoring reports will include a statement as to whether this data has invoked any 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (dose-limiting toxicities) in the clinical protocol.  
 
In addition to the Cancer Center's DMSC, the TJU BMT program members meet weekly 
to discuss the status of patients on trial and generate discussion regarding the progress 
of the patients on the trial. 
 
Auditing and Inspecting: 
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], 
the funding sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and 
quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, 
regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.). The investigator w ill 
ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities. 
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection 
by [CONTACT_137713].

[ADDRESS_220833] achieved 10% of target accrual. However, a 
study can be audited at any time based on recommendations by [CONTACT_1201], DSMC, 
CCRRC and/or the Director of Clinical Investigations, KCC. Studies are re-audited once 
they have achieved 50% of target accrual. Special audits may be recommended by [CONTACT_5040], DSMC or CCRRC based on prior findings, allegations of scientific misconduct and 
where significant irregularities are found through quality control procedures. Any 
irregularities identified as part of this process would result in a full audit of that study.  
 
In addition to the audits at 10 and 50%, the CRMO randomly audits at least [ADDRESS_220834] a bi-annual basis, to verify that there is a signed and dated patient consent form, 
the patient has met the eligibility criteria, and that SAEs are documented and reported 
to the TJU IRB.  
 
All reports are submitted to the DSMC for review and action (when appropriate). A copy 
of this report and recommended DSMC action is sent to the CCRRC and TJU IRB. The 
committee regards the scientific review process as dynamic and constructive rather 
than punitive. The review process is designed to assist Principal Investigators in 
ensuring the safety of study subjects and the adequacy and accuracy of any data 
generated. The TJU IRB may, based on the DSMC and auditor’s recommendation, 
suspend or terminate the trial. 
 
10.0  Statistical Analysis 
Statistical Analysis Plan: 
The main objective of this trial is to demonstrate that the disease free survival (DFS) at 
one year for patients treated on this clinical trial is significantly higher than 25% (the 
average 1-year DFS in historic controls). The primary hypothesis will be tested using an 
exact one-sided binomial test with alpha 0.05. The trial will be considered successful if 
the null hypothesis of 25% 1-year disease free survival (DFS) is rejected. In addition, 
the exact binomial 95% confidence interval for 1-year DFS will be computed. 
 
Sample Size: 
Sample size computations are based on expectation of ~45% disease free survival 
(DFS) at one year for patients treated on this clinical trial. This figure is based on the 
historical literature reviewed in Section 1.0, as well as our current experience with the 
outcomes of patients with similar disease states treated on the 2 Step 
approach. Assuming that the true 1 year DFS rate is 45%, we need 36 evaluable 
patients for an 80% power using a one-sided binomial test with alpha 0.05. Assuming a 
10% dropout/incompletion rate, we will need to enroll up to [ADDRESS_220835] are considered evaluable if…We estimate that it

ssessments for the secondary objectives will be reported descriptively. Data pertaining 
to the secondary objectives will be collected and placed in each patient’s study binder 
for analysis.  
 
Analysis for Safety 
Patient outcomes are routinely monitored in an ongoing fashion for all patients on 
investigational trials, beyond their formal endpoints. Based on prior experience using a 
two step approach similar to that described in this trial, we anticipate that the incidence 
of graft failure should be less than 10%, the incidence of severe GVHD (grade 3 or 4) 
should be less than 20%, and the non-relapse mortality should be less than 20% at [ADDRESS_220837] a sufficient denominator in which to examine 
outcomes based on percentages.

ppendix A: Modified Karnofsky Performance Scale – Web Based Tool 
The modified KPS is a Web-based tool developed in our program that builds upon the 
original KPS.64 The tool was developed to characterize each patient’s performance 
status in more depth than what was possible with the original KPS. The tool is intended 
to assist with the assessment and counseling of patients regarding their ability to 
withstanding the rigors of HSCT.  
 
On the tool, the item that most closely reflects the patient’s performance status is 
selected and the “submit” button is chosen. A performance score is then calculated. 
 
The categories “Not on immune suppression” and “At home, not self sufficient” are not 
further subdivided. The other three categories subdivide into additional questions. An 
example this further characterization is given below for the “Self sufficient at home” 
category.

ppendix C: Radiation Guidelines 
 
Modality: 
Photon irradiation is to be used for the TBI in all patients. Areas beneath lung blocks will 
be supplemented with electrons to maintain the homogeneity criteria.  
 
Energy:  
A linear accelerator with energy ≥ 4 MV.  Dose to superficial tissues near skin 
surface will be increased by [CONTACT_2329] a beam “spoiler” lucite plate close to the 
patient.  
 
Since neoplastic infiltrates may be found in the skin, it is necessary for the superficial 
dose to satisfy the same total dose requirements as other locations. 
 
Geometry  
The treatment configuration shall be such that the patient is entirely included within the 
treatment beam. It is essential that the correlation between the light field and the 
radiation field be established and verified for extended TBI distances. 
 
Dose Rate 
A dose rate of 0.05 to 0.25 Gy/minute at the prescription point shall be utilized. The 
physicist of record, involved with TBI treatments, shall be consulted to achieve correct 
range of treatment dose rate. 
 
Calibration & Beam Data Verification 
The calibration of the output of the machine, used for this protocol, shall be verified on a 
daily basis prior to start TBI treatments. All dosimetric parameters, necessary for the 
calculation of dose delivered during TBI treatments, shall be measured at the 
appropriate treatment distance. They shall be documented and made available for 
calculation of every patient treatment. 
 
Treatment Volume 
The patient shall be entirely included within the treatment beam. Care should be taken 
to guarantee that the entire patient is within the 90% decrement line at each depth. The 
90% decrement line is defined as the line in each plane perpendicular to the central axis 
connecting the points which are 90% of the central axis dose, in that plane.  
 
Diagnostic Determination  
CT scans through the chest and abdomen will be done prior to initiating irradiation. An 
average chest wall thickness (both anteriorly and posteriorly) will be calculated and 
used in determination of electron energy for supplementing the chest wall beneath the 
lung blocks. The abdominal scan, renal ultrasound, or intravenous pyelogram will be 
used to localize the kidneys for proper placement of renal shielding.

Kimmel Cancer Center 
[ADDRESS_220847] point along the longitudinal axis at the 
level of the umbilicus.  
 
Dose Units  
All doses shall be specified in Gray (Gy) to muscle tissue.  
 
Tissue Inhomogeneity Considerations  
No inhomogeneity corrections shall be made in the calculation  of the dose to the 
prescription point.  
 
Prescription Point Dose  
The total dose shall be 12.[ADDRESS_220848] wall dose with electrons (both anteriorly and posteriorly) shall 
be done once a day on 2 treatment days, immediately preceding or following treatment 
to the entire body. The area beneath the lung blocks shall receive an additional 6.0 Gy 
to dmax in a total of 2 fractions.  
 
Total Number of Treatment Days  
There shall be a total 3 consecutive treatment days.  
 
Treatment Interruptions  
An interruption in the radiotherapy regimen shall not be allowed.  
 
Dose Homogeneity  
The total absorbed dose along the patient's head to toe axis(in the midplane of the 
patient) shall not deviate more than 10% from the prescribed dose.  
 
Treatment Technique 
Treatment Fields  
Equally weighted parallel opposed portals shall be used. AP/PA fields shall be used. 
 
Field Size  
The collimation and treatment distance shall be such that the patient will be entirely 
included within the treatment beam and that no part of the patient extends beyond that 
region. The agreement of the light field and the radiation field should be checked 
periodically for the extended TBI treatment distance.

Version 2.3 Treatment Position  
The patient shall be treated in any position that is compatible with the homogeneity 
requirement, allowing for the reproducibility of the patient setup and dosimetry.  
 
Field Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_186843]. Customized blocking to the liver and/or 
kidneys is optional, at the discretion of each participating center with the approval of the 
coordinating center radiation oncologist.  
 
Patient specific, individually fabricated shielding blocks are required for the lung from 
both the anterior and posterior directions. A partial transmission block corresponding to 
a total dose of 8.[ADDRESS_220849] of the patient under the blocks shall be used. No 
corrections for inhomogeneity shall be used.  
 
Patient specific, individually fabricated shielding blocks are optional for the liver from 
both the anterior and posterior directions. A partial transmission block corresponding to 
a dose reduction to 90% of the central axis dose shall be utilized.  
 
Patient specific, individually fabricated shielding blocks are optional for the kidneys from 
the posterior direction only. A partial transmission block yielding a total dose of 10.8 Gy 
+/- 10% to the midplane of the kidney shall be used.  
 
Customized electron cut-outs shall also be constructed corresponding to the size of the 
lung block plus appropriate margins in all directions.  
 
Superficial Tissue Supplement Technique  
The portion of the chest wall shielded by [CONTACT_186872] (or shaped) low energy electron fields. A total of 6.[ADDRESS_220850] scan, 
with the depth of the 90% dose relative to dmax used to determine the electron energy. 
The dose prescription point will be at dmax.  
 
Calculations  
Central Axis Dose  
It is recommended that the dose calculation method be based upon measurements that 
are made in a unit density phantom with the following minimum dimensions:  
Length equal to top of shoulder to the bottom of the pelvis. 
Width equal to the patient width at the level of the umbilicus. 
Thickness equal to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_186844]. 
All measurements should be made at the appropriate extended SSD. 
 
Superficial Dose  
For the radiation beam with the Plexiglas plate in place, data should be available 
demonstrating that the skin dose is within 5% of the prescribed dose.

[ADDRESS_220851] wall supplement, the TBI delivers between 8.0 Gy +/- 10% (defined 
at midplane at level of carina). 
 
Quality Assurance Documentation  
For purposes of quality assurance the following must be performed on every patient 
undergoing TBI:  
 A check of the monitor unit calculation by a second physicist and a radiation 
oncologist prior to first treatment.  
 Simulation films documenting lung, liver and kidney blocks in both the anterior 
and/or posterior projections shall be taken.  
 Portal films (both AP & PA) verifying the position of the lung, liver and kidney 
blocks shall be taken and must be approved by [CONTACT_186873].

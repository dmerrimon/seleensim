INTRODUCTION  
You are being invited to take part in a medical research study. Before you decide to 
take part in this study, you should read this document. This document, called an 
informed consent documen t, explains the study. Please ask as many questions as 
needed so that you can decide if you want to be in the study.  
 
To be in this research study, you cannot already be in another medical research 
study.  
 
You must be honest and complete in providing your medical history. Giving false, 
incomplete, or misleading information about your medical history, including past and 
present drug use, could have very serious health consequences.  
 
The study doctor is being paid by [CONTACT_883963].  
 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY   
The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of treatment with Lumega Z®, (a 
medical food containing lutein, zeaxanthin and meso -zeaxanthin, as well as other 
components) with treatment with AREDS2. AREDS 2 is a nutrient formula used for 
age-related vision loss that is available over the counter and marketed by [CONTACT_59268] & 
Lomb as PreserVision® AREDS 2.  Lumega Z is different than PreserVision AREDS 2 in 
that it is available only by [CONTACT_883964], antioxidants, 
and micronutrients.

Patients with early signs of age -related vision loss (defined for this study as  having 
yellow deposits  in the retina  and no or mild abnormality of dark adaptatio n) that 
take one of the two treatments (PreserVision AREDS 2 or Lumega Z) will be 
compared with those with normal dark adaptation  and with the other treatment 
group.  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY  
Each potential patient will undergo a screening test called AdaptDx to identify 
patients with normal dark adaptation and those with abnormal adaptation. AdaptDx 
is a machine used to test dark adaptation that involves looking into a dark field and 
recognizi ng when a light appears.  All patients will receive the same exams at 
baseline, three months and six months (for details see listing below).  
 
Those who are confirmed as normal dark adaptation will receive no treatment 
because they do not need this treatme nt. Those who are confirmed with  a few 
drusen on Visucam photography and mild dark adaptation difficulty (less than or 
equal to 10 minutes on the AdaptDx) will receive one of two treatments below for 6 
months:  
 
x Lumega Z, a medical food, containing all [ADDRESS_1236664] sensitivity (CSV -1000)  
Intraocular pressure, non dilated slit lamp exam  
Dark adaptation (AdaptDx, extended exam)  
Macular Pi[INVESTIGATOR_883953] (Mapcat SF) 
Macular Ocular Coherence Tomography (Cirrus OCT)  
Fundus Photography (Zeiss Procam)  
 
If the Sponsor determines there is a need to extend the study, you may be asked 
to attend extra visits, although this is not required.

Protocol Number: [ADDRESS_1236671] of a Medical Food  
Containing  All Three Macular Caro tenoids and Essential  Cofactors   
Compared to  AREDS2 o n Early  Macular Degeneration  
 
PURPOSE:  
This 6-month  randomized control study is undertaken to compare the effect of treatment with  
LumegaZ, a medical food containing lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso -zeaxanthin, as well as 
essential cofact ors, other antioxidants, and mitochondrial support, with  the effect of  treatment 
with AREDS2.  P atients with early  macular degeneration, defined as photographically  visible 
drusen  with or without abnormal dark adaptation  on the AdaptDx  will be randomized 2:1 and 
both groups will be compared to untreated patients with normal dark adaptation.  
 
BACKGROUND:  
Macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in people over the age of 60.  
The incidence of macular degeneration at all stages is 1 in 8 and is more common than diabetes 
and glaucoma at the same age.  
The dietary car otenoids lutein and zeaxanthin (derived primarily from  leafy green vegetables 
and other colored fruits  and vegetables)  as well as meso -zeaxanthin, a metabolite of lu tein, are 
stored in the macula  in all healthy retinas.  This area serves central vison, and is the specific 
area that is affected by [CONTACT_883970].  The accumulation of these pi[INVESTIGATOR_883954] a 
yellowish coloration  of the retina, the concent ration of which is called macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_883955].  
A large multicenter trial called AREDS 2 (2013) showed that supplementing lutein and 
zeaxanthin  reduced progression of moderate to advanced AMD by 25%.  The CREST (2014) and 
MOST (2015) studies showed tha t supplementation of all [ADDRESS_1236672] sensitivity in early 
AMD.  All 3 macular carotenoids are recognized by [CONTACT_4760] ‘generally regarded as safe 
(GRAS) for supple mentation in foods.  
Macular degeneration can be understood as a disease of excessive oxidation of the retinal 
tissue with genetic, age, dietary and light exposure  components leading to accumulation of 
oxidized cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids  both on Bruch’s membrane and between 
Bruch’s membrane and the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_883956] a condition analogous to plaque 
buildup in arteries.  These deposits block transfer of waste out of the retina leading to more 
accumulation and block transfer of nutr ients into the retina.  In macular degeneration,  not 
enough Vitamin A  crosses Bruch’s membrane because of the build -up, causing a localized 
deficiency of Retinol in the parafoveal rods . This  causes  slower dark ada ptation after bleaching 
light, which is the  earliest symptom of macular degeneration: difficulty driving in darkness or 
adapting to dark cond itions  increasing with aging.  
Abnormal dark adaptation found by [CONTACT_883971]. This has enabled diagn osis of subclinical macular degeneration with 90% positive 
and negative test reliability, 3-[ADDRESS_1236673] drusen is visible clinically.  Those patients 
who exhibit impaired dark adaptation, whether they are subclinical with no drusen or early wit h 
mild drusen, may benefit from nutritional and /or lifestyle changes which could significantly 
slow the progression of the disease.  This would result in maintenance of retinal health and 
visual performance.  
It is clear that early, effective  intervention in any disease process is the key to reducing 
morbidity.  Earlier diagnosis of macular degeneration is now possible with AdaptDX testing.  
Effective intervention involves reducing the photo -oxidative damage of the retina caused by [CONTACT_883972], and potential clearing of the early stage blockage of bidirectional 
transport across Bruch’s membrane. Thirty percent of people over age [ADDRESS_1236674] abnormal dark 
adaptation.  Likewise, 30% of people have an abnormal spatia l profile of macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_883957] -zeaxanthin creation from lutein.  Supplementing meso -zeaxanthin  
as well as lutein and zeaxanthin can restore the macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_883958].  Ear ly results from an  as yet unpublished 
exploratory study in progress with such supplementation in subclinical AMD indicate 
improvement in MPOD and best  corrected contrast sensitivity in many patients by [ADDRESS_1236675] ement approval by [CONTACT_883973].  The medical food to be 
used by [CONTACT_883974] , but also significant cofactors, such a s vitamins,  minerals,  
ALA, astaxanthin, N -acetylcysteine,  carnosine and others.  A ll of these ingredients working 
together  should significantly improve the mitochondrial , antioxidant and anti -inflammatory 
functions of the retina.  This should allow  creation of less damage to critical elements of the 
retina and less toxic waste such as oxidized cholesterol and oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids 
which are the major components of the sub -RPE and Bru ch’s membrane deposits.  This 
controlled study will attempt to show that using a medical food designed to optimize  retinal 
metabolism and antioxidant capacity will exert a positive effect in subclinical macular 
degeneration, which is greater than supplemen tation with AREDS2 and will also improve 
measured functions into the range of function i n untreated normal patients.  
 
STUDY:  
All study candidates are routine patients in a general ophthalmology practice. All patients who 
are interested will be offered the  opportunity to participate in this controlled study of the 
effect of a nutritional food on subclinical macular degeneration. Each patient will undergo a 
screening AdaptDx to sep arate patients with n ormal dark adaptation from those with abnormal 
dark adaptation. All patients will receive the same exams at baseline,  [ADDRESS_1236676] dark adaptation scores of less than 10 minutes  will 
receive treatment by [CONTACT_279794] a commercially availab le medical food, containing all 3 macular 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_883959], or AREDS2,randomized 2:[ADDRESS_1236677] sensitivity  (CSV 1000)  
o Intraocular pressure, nondilated slit -lamp exam  
o Dark adaptation ( AdaptDX, extended exam)  
o Macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_835593] (MapcatSF)  
o Macular ocular coherence tomography (Z eiss Cirrus OCT ) 
o Fundus photography ( Zeiss VisuCam Pro)  
 
Because these patients will have additional problems found in routine clinical practice, oth er 
exams may occur for other problems and will not be considered part of the study data.  Should 
any adverse effects be noted thought to be from the study treatment, the patient will be 
examined to understand the effect and if it is felt to be not signific ant, the patient will be asked 
to continue in the study. In the highly unlikely event a serious adverse effect is noted the 
patient will be terminated from the study and appropriate treatment will be undertaken.  
 
DATA COLLECTION:  
The data will be maintaine d on standardized forms  and printable graphics, as well  as in the 
patient’s routine clinical file.  To protect identifiable information, files will be locked in a file 
cabinet, accessible only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_55532] e study coordinator. Data will be transcribed with out 
personally identifiable information into standard Excel files and analyzed as appropriate using 
standard statistical techniques.  
STUDY REQUIREMENTS:  
This study will be conducted  with the protocol, good clinical practices and applicable regulatory 
requirements. This is a no significant risk study, using commercially available supplements, 
Lumega -Z or AREDS 2, containing  2 or 3  of the three carotenoids that are FDA “generally  
recognized as safe” for food supplementation and are found in all healthy retinas. All 
examinations are noninvasive and are performed with FDA cleared, commercially available 
medical devices in routine clinical use.  
The study population consists of [ADDRESS_1236678]. Immediate 
attention will be paid to any serious adverse events, which by [CONTACT_883975]. If  any injuries occur to subjects in the protocol , they are considered to 
be under treatment for early  AMD, (diagnosis AMD, ICD H35.3131 ) and will be dealt with as any 
other medical condition or complication of treatment.  
Data will be reviewed for safety and unexpected positive or negative effects after three and six 
month visit period are completed for all subjects.  
Data will be collected in the subjects routine electronic medical record and confirmed as  
complete on a ha rd copy visit log in a study folder for each subject.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_883960]. There will be a protocol deviation log, adverse events log and a study 
supplement log in each subjects folder.  
The information collected will be us ed in anonymous group data analysis to be prepared for 
submission for potential publication. The information will not be sold or  used in future 
research. The data can be verified through the audit trail in the subject’s individual electronic 
medical record  original source. No data will be stored on a portable device. The data will not be 
destroyed because it is part of medical record of care of AMD unspecified for an individual  and 
is subject to the laws of the state of [LOCATION_007] and the rules of the state med ical board.  
Statistical Analysis Plan   At the end of the trail period, data will be collected by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_883961], Pomona CA.  The data provided will only contain patient ID, age, and sex, without containing any identifying details about each participant. Data will be analyzed upon measurement quality, according to the respective manufacturer procedures, in each outcome measure. In the event which data is missing or incomplete, we will evaluate the appropriate measures to include the available information and consult with qualified professionals.  Preliminary and sub-analyses will be performed using the statistical programing software, SPSS Systems. The objective is to examine the distribution and potential relationships within data sets through standardized descriptive-numerical summaries. Statistical analysis strategies may include a mixed-design Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) to examine the following outcome measures across the three time-points of data collection; including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, dark adaptation recovery, and MPOD levels. A post hoc sub-analysis of paired sample t-test may be used (either Bonferroni correction or Tukey test) to evaluate the change in each outcome measure parameter, if needed, in respect to each treatment group. Additionally, each group-measurement may be separated and analyzed by [CONTACT_72067]; to evaluate inter-eye differences from each treatment. Results of the statistical analysis will be analyzed as group averages of each outcome measurement.

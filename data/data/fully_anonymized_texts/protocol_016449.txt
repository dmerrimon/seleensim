Study Drug  GBT440 capsules: 300 mg strength, administered orally .  
Matching placebo, administered orally . 
Objectives  Primary  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of GBT440 
administered to subjects with IPF .  
Secondary  
 To evaluate the effect of GBT440 on oxygen saturation at Days 15 
and 28 compared to baseline during 6 -minute walk testing 
(6MWT).  
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of GBT440 in 
plasma and whole blood . 
Exploratory  
 To evaluate the effect of GB T440 on distance walked during the 
6MWT at Days 15 and 28 compared to baseline.  
 To evaluate the effect of GBT440 on IPF -related symptoms using 
patient reported outcomes (PROs) at Day 28 compared to baseline.  
 To evaluate the effect of GBT440 on cardiopulmon ary exercise 
testing  (CPET)  parameters at Day  29 compared to baseline.  
 To evaluate pulmonary function, including assessment of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_581786]  (DLco ) at Day 28 compared to baseline . 
 To evaluate the PK -pharmacodynamic ( PD) relationship of 
GBT440 at Days 15 and 28 compared to baseline.  
Study Design  This study is a randomized, placebo -controlled trial that will be conducted 
in two parts. Together, Parts A and B will provide safety and efficacy data 
across a range of GBT440 doses that are expected to improve oxygen 
saturation in the enrolled subjects.  
 In Part A , eligible IPF subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive 
GBT440 900 mg (n  = 6) or 600 mg (n  = 6), or placebo (n = 6) 
administered orally as 300 mg capsules once daily for 28 days . The 
study site, subjects and Sponsor will be blinded to study treatment.  
 In Part B  eligible IPF subjects will be randomized 3:1:1 to receive 
GBT440 1500 mg (n  = 9) or 600 mg (n  = 3), or placebo (n = 3) 
administered orally as 300 mg capsules once daily for 28 days in

 which the study site and subjects are blinded to study treatment. The 
Sponsor will be unblinded to study treatment.  
Subjects will participate in the study for approximately 79 days : screening 
(up to 21 days), treatment period (28 days) and follow -up period (30 days) 
with a total of [ADDRESS_765013] be 
completed  and evaluated before randomization (Day 1).   
Subjects may be rescreened up to two times, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_581825]. The rescreening visit should not occur sooner than 
10 calendar d ays after the failed screening visit.  
Patients on a stable dose of pi[INVESTIGATOR_581787]/or N -acetyl 
cysteine at screening are eligible for entry into the study . 
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) is planned to review all safety 
data on an ongoing  basis throughout the study. If the SMC does not 
identify any clinically significant safety concerns in Part A, following 
review of data from approximately [ADDRESS_765014] completed Day 
15, the Sponsor will initiate Part B of the study and randomise u p to an 
additional 15  subjects, to the three study treatment arms to better 
characterize the safety, tolerability and/or potential treatment response of 
GBT440 in subjects with IPF . 
The dose levels predicted to achieve the hemoglobin ( Hb) modification 
targets of ~20% to ~50% in IPF subjects are based on clinical PK and PD 
data from study GBT440 -001. Dose levels of 600 mg or 900  mg per day 
administered to healthy subjects for 15 days resulted in a mean Hb 
modifications of 24% and 38%, respe ctively. A dose level of 300 mg per 
day resulted in a mean Hb modification of 11%, which is below the PD 
effect that showed benefit in animal models of hypoxemia. A dose of 
1500  mg is expected to achieve a Hb modification target of ~50% .  
Part A Treatment:  
• GBT440 900 mg : 3 GBT440 300 mg capsules.  
• GBT440 600 mg : 2 GBT440 300 mg capsules and 1 placebo 
capsule.  
• Placebo : 3 placebo capsules.  
Part B Treatment:  
• GBT440 1500 mg : 5 GBT440 300 mg capsules  
• GBT440 600 mg:  2 GBT440 300 mg capsules and 3 placebo 
capsule s.  
• Placebo:  5 placebo capsules.  
In Part A two unblinded interim analyses of the primary and secondary 
endpoints are planned: i)  when approximately [ADDRESS_765015] completed 
their Day 28 study visit and ii) when approximately [ADDRESS_765016] 
completed their Day 15 study visit.

(DLco) Measurements  
All equipment, procedures, and personnel qualifications for the assessment 
of lung function are based on the recommendations of the American 
Thoracic Society ( ATS 2005 ) and will be performed at each site using 
local equipment. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_581789], FEV [ADDRESS_765028] -bronchodilator assessments will not be 
performed. DL CO will be measured at each site by [CONTACT_581828]/transfer capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide  
Oxygen Sa turation  
During screening and with all scheduled vital sign assessments resting, 
room air oxygen saturation (SpO 2) will be measured by [CONTACT_406] 
(provided by [CONTACT_1034]) whilst the subject is seated and resting for at 
least [ADDRESS_765029] (6MWT) and Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion  
Functional exercise capacity will be evaluated at baseline, Days 15, [ADDRESS_765030] using supplementar y oxygen. Oxygen may be used at any time 
during the 6MWT, if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_581790]. The 6MWT should then be 
stopped.  
Guidelines developed by [CONTACT_581829]/ATS will be used for conducting the te st 
and interpreting the results ( ATS 2002  and Holland 2014 ).  
As part of the 6MWT SpO 2, heart rate and the Borg dyspnea scale will be 
measured  prior to starting the test, during the test, at completion of the 
test, [ADDRESS_765031] completion.  
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)  
Symptom -limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing using a bicycle 
ergometer will be performed  at baseline and Day 29. At baseline and 
during the exercise period the collected data will include but is not limited 
to: SpO [ADDRESS_765032] and interpreting the results

St George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ)  
The SGRQ is a symptom -specific [ADDRESS_765033] self -administered 
questionnaire that assesses shortness of breath while do ing a variety of 
activities of daily living. This questionnaire comprises three domains: 
symptoms, activity and impact. Paper questionnaires will be provided to 
Protocol Number GBT440 -[ADDRESS_765034] ionnaire 
(UCSD)  
The UCSD is a 24-item assessment of breathlessness associated with 
various activities of daily living. The response for each item is measured 
on a 5 -point Likert scale from 0 (none at all) to 5 (maximal or unable to 
perform). Refer to the  Procedure Manual for a copy of the questionnaire. 
Paper questionnaires will be provided to sites prior to subject enrollment . 
Borg Dyspnea Scale  
The Borg Dyspnea scale is a one -item assessment, self -administered by 
[CONTACT_581830] 6 MWT.  The instrument will be 
used to assess dyspnea from the patient’s perspective. The Scale ranges 
from 0 (Nothing at all) to 10 (Absolute maximum/Highest possible). See 
Procedure Manual for a copy of the assessment. A paper scale will be 
supplied to si tes prior to subject enrollment.  
A Tool to Assess Quality of Life (ATAQ) in IPF  
ATAQ questionnaires (IPF Symptoms Questionnaire and IPF Impacts 
Questionnaire) will be administered in Part B of this study.  
End of Study Questionnaire  
The end of study questio nnaire is an 8-item survey to evaluate the subjects' 
experience while on the study including symptoms, changes in oxygen 
saturation and use. This is a self -administered survey to be completed 
during the Day 58 visit. The survey is to be completed by [CONTACT_581831] B of the trial.  
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Cough Severity  
Cough will be assessed using a VAS in which the subject will indicate the 
severity of their cough by [CONTACT_740] a mark on a 100 mm scale, which 
ranges  from 0 - “no cough” to 100  mm - “worst cough severity”. A paper 
scale will be supplied to sites prior to subject enrollment.   
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Plasma and whole blood concentrations of GBT440 will be measured. PK 
samples will be collected at the  following times: on Days 1 and 28 : 
pre-dose, and [ADDRESS_765035] dose (+/- 15 minutes); Day 2 : 24 hours (+/- 2 
hours) after the Day 1 dose and prior to receiving the Day 2 dose; Days 8 
and 15: pre-dose only; during follow -up on Days 45 and 58.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Disease Background  
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease of unknown etiology  that is 
characterized by [CONTACT_581832], resulting in worsening dyspnea 
and progressive loss of lung function [Raghu 2011 ]. IPF is the most common type of 
interstitial lung disease with a  high mortality rate [Michaelson 2000 ]. While the course of the 
disease is variable, the prognosis is uniformly poor, with  a median survival of about 
3-5 years after diagnosis. [Raghu 2006 , King 2001 , Nicholson 2000 ]. In the [LOCATION_002], it 
is estimated to affect up to 200,000 people with approximately 50,000 new cases dia gnosed 
each year [Raghu 2006 ] and approximately 40,000 dying  each year [Olson 2012 ]. IPF is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_581792], more commonly in men than women, usually occurring 
between the ages of 50 -80 years, with a median age of 65 at diagnosis [Raghu 2006 ]. The 
natural course of IPF is variable. As the interstitial fibrosis and architectural distortion 
advance, the lung becomes increasingly non -compliant, and the work of breathing and 
dyspnea increase. The lungs lose their ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream 
resulting in hypoxemia, tissue hypoxia, and ultimately organ dysfunction and symptoms. 
Subject s with IPF typi[INVESTIGATOR_581793], with the development of significant co -morbidities, the use of supplemental oxygen and 
frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581794] [Raghu 2011 ]. Supplemental oxygen 
relieves dyspnea, prevent s secondary pulmonary hypertension and improves functional 
status, but requires equipment for oxygen administration which can limit patient  mobility and 
quality of life.  
There are two marketed products available for the treatment of IPF, nintedanib and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_581795] 2015 [ Raghu  2015 ]. In clinical studies, these products demonstrated an effect on forced 
vital capacity and decline in lung function, but did not show an effect o n survival or disease 
modification . Furthermore , these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_581796] [ Richeldi 2014 , King 2014 ]. IPF 
remains a disease with high unmet medical need requiring novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_581797] -morbidities and that provide improvement 
in the patients’ quality of life . 
1.2. GBT440  
Global Blood Therapeutics (GB T) has developed GBT440, a novel small molecule allosteric 
modulator of hemoglobin (Hb) oxygen affinity , that is currently being investigated for the 
treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) . GBT440 binds to the Hb α chain, and thus has the 
same pharmacodyna mics effect on normal adult h emoglobin (HbA) than on sickle  
hemoglobin (HbS). In SCD, GBT440’s effect on HbS was expected to decrease red blood 
cell sickling, which was confirmed in preliminary Phase I/II data [ Lehrer -Graiwer 2015 ]. 
Likewise for IPF , GBT440’s effect on HbA is expected to increase oxygen uptake in the  
lungs , improve hypoxemia  and oxygen delivery to tissues and in turn provide significant 
benefit  to IPF patients . 
In IPF , hypoxemia results from  ventilation -perfusion mismatch and ineffici ent gas exchange 
at the alveolar -capi[INVESTIGATOR_45075]. The resultant reduced oxygen saturation (SpO 2) leads to 
Protocol Number GBT440 -006  Global Blood Therapeutics

CONFIDENTIAL  
 insufficient  oxygen delivery to tissues and tissue hypoxia, and in turn numerous adverse 
systemic effects including exercise intolerance with associ ated desaturation and pulmonary 
hypertension. As demonstrated by [CONTACT_581833], i mproving 
oxygenation  clearly provides clinical benefit ; with improvement in  dyspnea, functional 
capacity, quality of life, and prevention of disease associated complications . [Eaton. 2004 ] 
Based on it’s mechanism of action, GBT440 is expected to increase Hb -O2 saturation at low 
alveolar oxygen tensions and provide similar benefit to patients with IPF.  In support o f this 
hypothesis, individuals with naturally occurring high affinity Hb mutations are 
physiologically adapted to the low oxygen tensions present at high altitude and are able to 
load and deliver more oxygen than normal controls [Hebbel 197 8]. Furthermore, numerous 
animal models have shown that increasing Hb oxygen affinity during acute and chronic 
hypoxia improves arterial oxygenation, cardiovascular function and survival. [Eaton  1974 , 
Yalcin and Cabrales 2012 ] Based on these observations and its ability to safely increase Hb 
oxygen affinity in  humans (both healthy subjects  and patients with SCD in the ongoing 
GBT440 -001 study), GBT440 may improve arterial oxygenation, tissue oxygen delivery, 
symptoms and functional status in subjects with IPF.  
1.3. Rationale for Study  
GBT440, a hemoglobin modifier that causes a left -shift in th e oxy-hemoglobin dissociation 
curve (ODC ) has the potential to enable increased oxygen uptake in the lungs  and O2 
saturation, resulting in improved oxygen delivery to tissues. A key therapeutic  goal for IPF 
patients  with GBT440 is to reduce hypoxemia and i mprove the associated debilitating 
symptoms and functional impairment. Supplemental oxygen therapy is a well -established 
treatment in IPF and other chronic hypoxemic pulmonary diseases where it improves 
symptoms, functional status and (in the case of C hronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ) 
improves survival. Supplemental oxygen therapy has disadvantages, however, which can 
negatively impact patient quality of life including the burden and decrease d mobility from 
the required oxygen delivery devices, local complications , poor compliance and  inadequate 
symptomatic relief . GBT440 therapy may be able to provide many of the same clinical 
benefits of oxygen therapy without the negative aspects of oxygen supplementation. GBT440 
could also be useful as an adjunct to oxygen therapy in more severe subject s who are not 
adequately oxygenated despi[INVESTIGATOR_581798], 
more convenient oxygen equipment for the same clinical benefit. This study will gather 
preliminary data , across a  range of GBT440 doses , to determine whether  GBT440 could 
improve : oxygen saturation  at rest and with exercise , IPF-related symptoms  and exercise 
capacity.  
GBT440 has been administered to healthy subjects  and subjects with SCD. Overall, multiple 
doses of G BT440 have  been well tolerated across a broad range of doses (300 mg –1000mg ) 
for up to [ADDRESS_765036] s. 
1.4. Nonclinical Data  
An overview of the key nonclinical data is provided below.  For a more detailed discussion of 
the nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicology studies conducted to 
date, please refer to the GBT440 Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .

CONFIDENTIAL  
 1.4.1.  Nonclinical Pharmacology  
In vitro pharmacology studies were conducted to  characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) 
effects of GBT440. These studies demonstrated that GBT440 binds to Hb, modulates Hb -O2 
affinity and maintains the oxyHb state during deoxygenation. In addition, these studies 
showed that GBT440 -modified Hb retains the  Bohr Effect, which is the ability to augment 
oxygen delivery in metabolically active (low pH) tissues. This should preserve the ability of 
GBT440 -modified  hemoglobin to off -load oxygen to metabolically active tissues, despi[INVESTIGATOR_581799].  
In vivo pharmacology studies were performed in murine models of acute hypoxia challenge 
and pulmonary hypoxemia (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] -induced acute lung injury [ALI] and 
bleomycin induced lung fibrosis and hypoxemia. These in vivo studies demonst rated that 
pharmacologically increasing Hb -O2 affinity in these mouse models of pulmonary 
hypoxemia resulted in improved O 2 saturation, translating into improved physiologic 
endpoints and survival.  
1.4.2.  Safety Pharmacology  
Safety assessments of GBT440 in three in vivo studies did not identify any biologically 
significant effects in the central nervous system ( CNS ) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]. There were 
minor effects in the cardiovascular ( CV) safety pharmacology studies, with a mild increase in 
systolic BP at higher  doses (1000  mg/kg) and a small decrease (15.3%) in hERG channel 
current at 10µM. Based on these results, there appears to be a low risk to humans for adverse 
effects on CNS, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or CV function.  
1.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation sho wed that GBT440 had low blood clearance (CL), low 
blood V ss, and long  terminal t½ and was well absorbed in all animal species tested.  GBT440 
whole blood concentrations were much higher than plasma concentrations (calculated RBC : 
plasma  ratio ~150:1), consistent with a high affinity and specificity of GBT440 for Hb. The 
PK properties of GBT440 in animals suggest that it will preferentially bind to Hb and be 
slowly but completely eliminated from the body.  With increasing doses in rats and  dogs, the 
exposure with GBT440  is less than dose -proportional .  
Protocol Number GBT440 -[ADDRESS_765037] . In vitro metabolism studies indicate that GBT440 could be 
metabolized by [CONTACT_64069], i.e., CYP1A1, 1B1, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, and 3A5.  
However, in total, the data show that the exposure of GBT440 is unlikely to dramatically 
increase ( <1.7-fold) whe n coadministered  with a CYP inhibitor.  Refer to  Section 8.5.2  for 
restricted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_411598].  
GBT440 has also been evaluated as a potential inhibitor /substrate  of various membrane 
transporters. Refer to the GBT440 IB for further details of these  studies . 
1.4.5.  Toxicology  
The toxicity of GBT440 has been evaluated in single dose , repeat dose  and reproductive  
toxicity studies . The genotoxic potential of GBT440 has been evaluated in a battery of in 
vitro and in vivo assays . The details of the nonclinical t oxicology pr ogram, including 
toxicokinetics, are provided  in the GBT440 IB. 
1.5. Clinical Development of GBT440  
Clinical studies to date have been conducted primarily in healthy subjects and subjects with 
SCD.  They include an ongoing Phase I/II study (GBT440 -001), Phase II adolescent SCD 
study (GBT440 -007) and 8 (4 complete and 4 ongoing) Phase  I clinical pharmacology 
studies in healthy subjects.  GBT440 is also being evaluated in an ongoing Phase II study in 
IPF subjects using oxygen at rest (GBT440 -026). 
The Ph ase I/II study (GBT440 -001) is a randomized, placebo -controlled, ascending dose 
study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD effects of single and multiple doses of 
orally administered GBT440 in healthy subjects and subjects with SCD.  Healthy subj ects 
have received multiple -doses of 300 mg to 900 mg/day of GBT440 for up to [ADDRESS_765038] received multiple doses of 500  mg to 1000 mg/day for up to 28  days, and 
700 mg or 900 mg/day for up to 90  days; some subjects (900 mg) are continuing t reatment 
for up to 6 months under a separate protocol (GBT440 -024).  
The Phase II study in adolescent subjects with SCD (GBT440 -007) is an open -label, single  
dose and multiple  dose PK study of GBT440 in pediatric subjects, ages 12 to 17 years.   
The eight clinical pharmacology studies (GBT440 -002, GBT440 -003, GBT440 -004, 
GBT440 -005, GBT440 -008, GBT440 -017, GBT440 -018 and GBT440 -019) are evaluating  
the absorption, metabolism, excretion,  food effect,  relative bioavailability  and drug -
drug- interactions (DDI)  of GBT440.  
The Phase II IPF study (GBT440 -026) is an open label  trial evaluating the safety of GBT440 
and its effects on oxygen saturation and supplemental oxygen requirements in IPF subjects  
who use oxygen at rest . GBT440 is being  dosed at  [ADDRESS_765039] 1 dose of GBT440:  
205 healthy subjects , 47 adult SCD subjects  and 7 pediatric SCD subjects .  
The majority of the adverse events ( AEs) were mild or  moderate (Grade 1 or Grade 2), most 
commonly headache or diarrhea, and no clinically significant findings in vital signs, 12 -lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) , or laboratory safety values  were identified . 
In the SCD subjects dosed for 90 days, the majority of th e AEs were also mild or moderate 
(Grade 1 or Grade 2).  The most common AEs, occurring in ≥ 2 subjects and at a similar 
frequency in GBT440 and placebo -treated subjects, were headache, back pain, fatigue, and 
rhinitis.  
The AEs that occurred at a higher rate  in subjects receiving GBT440 included cough, 
diarrhea , and rash, of which diarrhea and rash were considered treatment -related by [CONTACT_3786] . No epi[INVESTIGATOR_581800], anaphylactoid, or hypersensitivity reactions were 
reported.  
Rashes were morbilliform in nature, typi[INVESTIGATOR_581801], associated 
with mild pruritus, resolving within 2 to 5 days (in one case with continued dosing), and were 
not associated with any systemic features.  
Overall, 10 serious adverse events ( SAEs) have been reported  as of 30 September  2016 , in 
10 subjects with SCD, considered by [CONTACT_581834].  
There were 7 events of sickle cell crisis (Grade 3), all occurring off treatment during 
follow -up (1  placebo; 6 GB T440); one event of presumed infection with hemolysis (Grade 2) 
(GBT440); one event of an ovarian cyst (Grade 3), occurring after the last dose of study drug 
(GBT440) and one event of Grade [ADDRESS_765040] infection requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(GBT 440). 
Please refer to the GBT440 IB for additional details on  GBT440 safety findings .  
1.5.2.  Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
The mean PK results of GBT440 from analy zed samples to date , derived from whole blood 
concentration -time profiles , shows that both C max and AUC increased proportionally with 
study drug dose for both single or multiple doses. The exposure of GBT440 at steady -state 
was consistent with accumulation predicted based on the single dose data.  
For the same dose, GBT440 exposure was lower and the  T1/[ADDRESS_765041] hematocrit values within  the normal range, PK of GBT440 in these patients are 
expected  to be similar to that of healthy volunteers.  Please refer to the GBT440 IB for 
additional details of GBT440 PK parameters .

CONFIDENTIAL  
 1.5.3.  Dose Rationale  
The selection of GBT440 doses for investigation in IPF patie nts is based on 
pharmacodynamic  (PD) targets that are expected to correspond  to an increase in Hb -O2 
affinity which may  result in a clinically significant increase in oxygenation. These PD targets 
are derived  from data from three nonclinical pharmacology studies that included a hypoxia 
challenge model and two models of pulmonary hypoxemia (refer to the IB for details of these 
studies). Based on the in vivo data the lower limit for treatment response during exe rcise -
induced desaturation is expected to be ~20% Hb occupancy by [CONTACT_558120]440 .  
The dose levels predicted to achieve the Hb modification targets of ~20% to ~50 % in IPF 
subjects are based on clinical PK and PD data from study GBT440 -001. Dose levels of 
600 mg or 900 mg per day administered to healthy subjects for 15 days resulted in a mean Hb 
modifications of 24% and 38%, respectively. A dose level of 300 mg per day resulted in a 
mean Hb modification of 11%, which is below the PD effect that showed benefit in ani mal 
models of hypoxemia.   
The safety of the proposed  doses of 600 mg and 900 mg  in the in itial c ohort (Part A) of 
approximately 18 subjects and the safety of pursuing parallel dosing in this study are based 
on the totality of available nonclinical and clin ical safety data.  The expansion Cohort (Part B) 
of [ADDRESS_765042] 3 dose arms: 1500  mg, 600  mg and placebo.  Addition of a higher 
dose is supported by : [CONTACT_581835] A  subjects dosed to  
date in this study ; review by [CONTACT_581836] 
12 subjects who completed up to 28 days and 16 subjects who completed 15 days of dosing  
in Part A  and Safety Monitoring Committee agreement to proceed with the evaluation of 
GBT440 1500 mg; cont inued favorable safety profile in ongoing studies evaluating GBT440 
in subjects with SCD, including continued dosing for up to 6 months ; and an anticipated 
dose-dependent improvement in oxygen saturation . Guidelines for the safety review of Part 
A and Part  B of the trial are outlined in the Safety Monitoring Committee section ( Section 
10.1). 
1.5.4.  Potential Risk of GBT440 Treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tissue Hypoxia  
There is a theoretical r isk of tissue hypoxia in subjects treated with GBT440 based on the 
mechanism of action  and potential associated impairment in O [ADDRESS_765043]  
and in vivo data from animal models of pulmonary hypoxemia are consistent with increased 
oxygen extraction and consumption by [CONTACT_68061].  Furthermore , clinical data from subjects 
receiving study drug and those participating in maximal cardio -pulmonary exerci se tests in 
the ongoing Phase I/II study, GBT440 -001, have not identified a concern with tissue hypoxia.  
Please r efer to the GBT440 IB  for further det ails. 
IPF subjects in this study will be closely monitored for subclinical evidence of worsening 
tissue hy poxia as measured by [CONTACT_581837], increased resting heart rate and erythropoietin 
and laboratory tests indicating organ injury (e.g. liver aminotransferases ). To date, none of 
these findings have been documented in Part A subjects dosed in this study.

 1.5.5.  Conclusions  Based on Clinical Study  Data  
The emerging experience from clinical studies in healthy volunteer s, SCD and approximately  
16 IPF subjects from Part A of this study (reviewed by [CONTACT_4484]) , having received  GBT440 
across a wide range of doses , has shown that GBT440 is well tolerated and no clinically 
significant sa fety signal has been identified. Based on these results  it is anticipated that 
GBT440 will have favorable benefit -to-risk profile in  IPF subjects , enrolled in both Parts A 
and B of th is study . 
The steady -state exposure and PD effect, which are predicted for the  [ADDRESS_765044] been demonstrated to be safe and tolerated in the healthy subjects 
treated with GBT440 for 15 days in the Phase I/II study (GBT440 -001). The 1500 mg  dose to 
be included in Part B is supported by [CONTACT_581838]  600 mg  and 90 0 
mg dose arms  in this study  and an anticipated dose -dependent improvement in oxygen 
saturation . Furthermore, safety experi ence in SCD subjects treated for 90 days supports the 
proposed 28  day treatment duration in IPF subjects.

 3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Study Design  
This study is a randomized, placebo -controlled trial that will be conducted in two parts. 
Together , Parts A and B will provide safety and efficacy data across a range of GBT440 
doses that are expected to improve oxygen saturation in the enrolled subjects.  
 In Part A  (Figure  1) eligible IPF subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive GBT440 
900 mg (n  = 6) or 600 mg (n  = 6), or placebo (n  = 6) administered orally as 300 mg 
capsules once daily for 28 days . The study site, subjects and Sponsor will be blinded to 
study treatment.  
 In Part B  (Figure  2) eligible IPF subjects will be randomized 3:1:1 to receive GBT440 
1500 mg (n  = 9) or 600 mg (n  = 3), or placebo (n = 3) administered orally as 300 mg 
capsules once daily for 28 days in which the study site and subjects are blinded to study 
treatment. The Sponsor will be unblinded to study treatment.  
A signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) must  be obtained  before any screening 
procedures or study -specific tests may be performed.   
The screening period for each subject commences when the subject undergoes the first 
study -specific screening assessment and must be completed  and tests evaluated before 
randomizat ion (Day 1).  Subjects may be rescreened up to two times, if deemed appropriate 
by [CONTACT_9525].  The rescreening visit should not occur sooner than 10 calendar 
days after the failed screening visit .

Study drug will be dispensed to subjects on study Days 2, 8 and 15 as indicated in the 
schedule of assessments ( refer to  Appendix A ). Each daily dose will be dispensed into 
separate containers and provided to the sub ject at the study site.  
If a dose reduction is required subjects must return to the study site for study drug to be 
re-dispensed. Subjects must return any remaining study drug and all study drug containers to 
the site where they will be destroyed as instru cted by [CONTACT_1034].  
8.3. Dose Modification  
Modification of study drug dosing may be considered if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_581810], the AE may be related to study drug and it would be unsafe for the subject to 
continue receiving their current dose of study drug. The Investigator’s assessment of AE 
relatedness should take into account the toxicity profile of all concomitant medications 
including pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317] .

Dose adjustments  may be initiated by [CONTACT_581848] ’s 
Medical Director . 
The Investigator , in discussion with the Sponsor’s  Medical Director,  may cho ose to: 
• Change dosing frequency,  to one capsule 3 times per day   
• Reduce the total daily dose   
A reduction in dose should be by [CONTACT_581849] . Dose reductions will require 
the subject to return to the study site for the unblinded pharmacist to dispense new study drug 
capsules.  Subjects will continue to take [ADDRESS_765077] . The timing of 
the second dose reduction will be based on the Investigator’s clinical assessment and in 
discussion with the Sponsor ’s Medical Director .  
The Investigator must make every effort to restart the dosing regimen assigned to the subject 
at rando mization , as soon as it is safe to do so .  
8.3.2.  Dose I nterruption  
Dose interruption may be initiated by [CONTACT_581850]’s  
Medical Director .  
Re-initiation of dosing will be based on the Investigator’s clinical assessment and in 
discussion with the Sponsor ’s Medical Director . Dosing should  be restarted at the dose 
assigned to the subject at randomization.  
The Investigator must make every effort t o restart the dosing regimen assigned to the subject 
at randomization as soon as it is safe to do so.  
Study treatment may be discontinued due to an AE if , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it is 
unsafe for the subject to continue receiving study drug . Patients who discontinue study drug 
should remain in the study and complete all scheduled assessments ( refer to  Section 6).

8.4. Treatment Overdose  
To date no events of overdose have been reported. Based on the mechanism of action of 
GBT440, the result of an overdose might include, but is not limited to, increased severity of 
previously reported associated adverse events or decrease d oxygen delivery to tissues  (refer 
to Section 1 ). In the event of a medical emergency due to suspected GBT440 overdose  the 
Medical Monitor  should be contact[CONTACT_112073] .  
8.5. Concomitant Medications  
A concomitant medication is defined as any prescription or over-the-counter preparation, 
inclu ding vitamins and supplements.  
In the interests of subject safety and accept able standards of medical care the Investigator 
will be permitted to prescribe treatment(s) at his/her discretion.  For all randomized subjects, 
all administered concomitant medications from signing the informed consent until the last 
study visit must be recorded in the subjects’ eCRF . 
All prior and concomitant medications that have been reported , will be coded  using the 
current version of the WHO Drug Dictionary . 
8.5.1.  Permitted therapy  
Use of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_581814]:  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], nintedanib or N -acetylcysteine (NAC)  for the treatment of IPF   
- If at the time of screening, the dose has been stable for at least 1 month prior to 
screening and with no anticipated need for dose adjustments during the study.  
• Corticosteroids:  
- if the dose at screening is ≤10 mg per day of prednisone (or an equivalent) and 
has been stable for at least [ADDRESS_765078]’s medical 
history a t the time of screening . 
Medications such as acetaminophen, non -steroidal anti -inflammatories and routinely 
taken  dietary supplements, including vitamins are allowed at the discretion of the 
investigator and provided that the medications have no discernabl e impact on the study .

8.6. Fertility/Contraceptive Requirements  
8.6.1.  Acceptable Forms of Contraception  
Highly effective methods of birth control are  defined as those which result in a low failure 
rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:  
- Oral 
- Intravaginal  
- Transd ermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
- Oral 
- Injectable  
- Implantable  
Note: Hormonal contraception must be supplemented with a barrier method (preferably male 
condom).

 • Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomised partner. Note that vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth 
control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of child 
bearing potential trial particip ant and that the vasectomised partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success.  
• Sexual abstinence. Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if 
the subject is refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire pe riod of risk 
associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.  
For male subjects:  
• Men must agree to use two acceptable methods of contraception, at least one of which 
must be a barrier method (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of 
the study , and for [ADDRESS_765080] r andomization will be carried out central ly through an Interactive Response System 
(IxRS). 
In Part A , eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to either: 9 00 mg GBT440, 600 mg 
GBT440 or p lacebo , respectively . A total of approximatel y 18 subjects will be randomized .  
In Part B,  up to an additional  15 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 3:1:1 to either: 
1500  mg GBT440, 600 mg GBT440 or placebo  to further  characterize the safety , tolerability 
and potential treatment response of GBT440.  In the eventuality that one treatment arm is 
discontinued subjects may be randomised 1:[ADDRESS_765081]’s medical condition requires 
knowledge of the treatment assignment, the study blind may be broken (through IxRS ) for 
that specific subject only.  If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], there is no impact on patient 
safety,  the Investigator is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_3433] e Sponsor’s Medical Director  prior to 
unblinding. The reason for unblinding must be  documented in the  appropriate section of the 
eCRF .  
At the study site , only t he Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_581817] . If, in the Investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] , and for the s afety of the subject other study site personnel are required to be aware 
of the treatment assignment , the Investigator  will ensure that the minimum number of 
personnel are informed.  
The SMC must be informed by [CONTACT_1034] ’s Medical Director  of any case of unblinding . 
Additionally, the SMC may unblind individual treatment assignment for further safety 
evaluation at their discretion.

 10. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
GBT440 is not an approved drug and as a result,  the entire safety profile is not known at th is 
time. This Phase II study will contribute to the understanding of the safety profile for 
GBT440  and for its use in IPF patients.  
10.1. Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC)  
The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) consisting of the Sponsor’s Medical Director , one 
Independent Physician  with clinical IPF expertise and one Independent  Physician with 
clinical trial experience. The SMC, along with the CRO’s statistician and data manager, will 
review the safety data throughout the study .  
The SMC may meet at any time during the study to review blinded or unblinded data when 
deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_4484] .  
In Part A, t he SMC will initially convene to review all available safety data after 
approximately [ADDRESS_765082] completed 
the Day 15 visit. I f the SMC does not identify any clinically significant safety concerns the 
Sponsor will randomise  up to an additional 15 subje cts, to three study treatment arms (1500 
mg GBT440, 60 0 mg  GBT440 or placebo) to better characterize the safety, tolerability 
and/or potential treatment response of GBT440.  
In Part B, the SMC will initially convene to review all available safety data after 
approximately [ADDRESS_765083] one dose of study drug.  
Details of the SMC are described in a separate charter.  
10.2. Adverse Events  (AE)  
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a ny subject enrolled in a clinical 
investigation administered a pharmaceutical product  regardless of causal attribution.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and /or unintended sign, symptom, or disease 
temporally associat ed with the use of an investigational product, whether or not it is thought 
to be related to the investigational product. In addition to new events, any increase in the 
severity or frequency  of a pre -existing condition that occurs is considered an AE. This  
includes any side effect, injury, tox icity or sensitivity reaction.  Subjects will be monitored 
throughout the study for AEs, from the time informed consent is obtained until the last study 
visit (Day 58). Reporting of AEs prior to randomization should onl y include SAEs or AEs 
resulting from any protocol related interventions.  
Adverse events that are identified at the last assessment visit as specified in the protocol must 
be recorded in the  eCRF. All events that are ongoing at this time will be recorded  as ongoing 
on the eCRF. All (both serious and nonserious) AEs must be followed until they are resolved 
or stabilized, or until reasonable attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted. 
The investigator should use his/her discretion in orderi ng additional tests as necessary to 
monitor the resolution of such events.  
Protocol Number GBT440 -006  Global Blood Therapeutics  
Final  21 December 2016  Amendment 3  Page 54 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 All reported AEs will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The procedures specified in Section 10.7 are to be followed for reporting  SAEs.  
10.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events are to be recorded on the AE eCRF. The following information will be 
recorded:  
• Whether o r not the AE is an SAE ( Section 10.4.1 ) 
• AE severity (Section 10.4.2 ) 
• AE relationship to investigational product ( Section 10.4.4 ) 
• Action taken , includin g but not limited to none, study drug dose modification  or 
discontinu ation, required concomitant medication, required procedure, or other  
• Outcome - recorded as : event resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, or death . 
10.4. Assessment of Adverse Events  
The investigator will assess each AE for seriousness, severity , and relationship to study drug . 
10.4.1.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
The investigator is responsible for determining whether an AE meets the definition of an 
SAE. An SAE is any AE occurring from signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the 
end of the study (Day 58) that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening  
- i.e. an AE that places the subject at immediate risk of death   
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105690]  
• A persistent or signi ficant disability or incapacity  
- i.e. a substantial disruption in the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  in a neonate or infant born to a mother exposed 
to study drug  
• Significant medical events that , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871],  may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
SAEs will be reported to the CRO’s Drug Saf ety Department within 24  hours of the 
investigator, designee, or site personnel’s  knowledge of the event. Refer to “Reporting 
Serious Adverse Events” ( Section 10.7) for details.  
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581818] a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462598] (e.g. elective surgery) during the study, that was scheduled prior to the subject 
entering the study (i .e. before the subject signed the inf ormed consent) for a pre -existing 
condition (i.e. one that occurred before the study). However, if the event/condition worsens 
Protocol Number GBT440 -[ADDRESS_765084] be reported as an AE (or SAE, if the event/ condition results in a 
serious outcome such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]). 
10.4.2.  Protocol -Defined Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is any AE occurring from signing of the 
informed consent form (ICF) until the end of the study (Day 58) that results in: 
 An alle rgic reaction/hypersensitivity:  Grade 2 or higher (as defined by [CONTACT_581853] 4.03)  
AESIs will be reported to the CRO’s Drug Safety Department within 24  hours of the 
investigator, designee, or site personnel’s  knowledge of the event. Refer to Section 10.[ADDRESS_765085] and/or the need for 
medical care necessary to treat th e event.  Adverse events reported for subjects participating 
in this study will be graded using the National Cancer Institute’s  (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criter ia for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03  
The Investigator will grade the severity of each AE us ing, when applicable, the NCI CTCAE, 
version 4.03. For AEs not included  in the NCI -CTCAE Version 4.03 , the c riteria outlined in 
Table  2 should be used as a g eneral guideline.  
Table  2 Grading for Adverse Events not Covered  in the NCI -CTCAE  
 
Severity  Description  
Grade 1 – Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
Grade 2 – Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limited age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
Grade 3 – Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; 
disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
Grade 4 – Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5 – Fatal  Death  
ADL  = activities of daily living; NCI -CTCAE = National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events . 
10.4.4.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the investigational product should be determined  by [CONTACT_89300]:  
Protocol Number GBT440 -006  Global Blood Therapeutics  
Final  21 December 2016  Amendment 3  Page 56 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 • Not Related:  Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the 
study drug (such as a preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication).  
• Possibly/Probably Related:  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset 
and administration of the study drug.  It cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_581819] t he known therapeutic and pharmacologic actions of the drug.  In 
case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the event abates or resolves and reappears 
upon rechallenge.  It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be 
considered as causally related in the context of adverse event reporting.  
These criteria in addition to good clinical judgment should be used as a guide for determining 
the causal assessment.  If it is felt that the event is not related to study drug therapy, then an 
alternative explanation should be provided.  
10.4.5.  Unexpected Adverse Reactions  
An adverse reaction is ‘unexpected’ if its nature and severity are not consistent with the 
information about the  study drug : 
• In the case of a product with a marketing authorization , in the summar y of product 
characteristics for that product . 
• In the case of any other IMP, in the Investigator’s Brochure relating to the trial in 
question .  
10.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
10.5.1.  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the eCR F rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g. , record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs  and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized  as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information  and the diagnosis 
entered in the e CRF . 
10.5.2.  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g. , cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is 
known to have resulted i n dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or 
SAE on the eCRF .  
However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example , if a 
severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should  be recorded 
separately on the eCRF . 
Protocol Number GBT440 -[ADDRESS_765086]  
evaluation time points . Such events should only be recorded once in the eCRF unless their 
severity increases.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it  should be recorded again on 
the Adverse Event  eCRF.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subjec t evaluation time points and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an Adverse Event eCRF.  
10.5.4.  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF (e.g. abnormalities  that require study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow -up assessments, 
further diagnostic investigation, etc.). 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a  disease or syndrome (e.g. , 
increased alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin associated  with cholecystitis ), only the diagnosis 
(e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the eCRF . 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be 
recorded as the AE or SAE.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0  mEq/L 
should be recorded as “hyperkalemia” . 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the Adverse  Event eCRF, unless their 
severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.  
10.6. Discontinuation due to Adverse Events  
Any subject who experiences an AE , serious or nonserious , may have study drug 
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator. The AE(s) should be noted on 
the appropriate eCRFs and the subject’s progress should be followed until the AE is resolved 
or stabilized  as determined by [CONTACT_34462]. The Sponsor’ Medical Director and the CRO  
medical monitor must be notified. If the AE relates to overdose of study treatment, the 
Investigator’s Brochure should be consulted for details of any specific actions to be t aken.  
Subjects sho uld return to the study to complete assessments as outl ined in Section [ADDRESS_765087]  
SAEs /AESIs  occurring in this study will be reported  to the CRO’s Drug Safety Department 
within 24  hours of the investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the event.  The 
SAE /AESI  will be reported by [CONTACT_581854] /AESI  eCRF in  the EDC system.  
In the event that the EDC system is not ava ilable, a paper SAE /AESI  report form  must be 
submitted  to the CRO’s Drug Safety Department ( [EMAIL_3649] or faxed to 
[PHONE_3101] ) within [ADDRESS_765088] complete the SAE /AESI  eCRF page as soon as the EDC system becomes 
available.  
Protocol Number GBT440 -[ADDRESS_765089] (IRB) or 
Independent Eth ics Committees (IEC) in accordance with local regulations, of all SAEs.  The 
Sponsor  or designee may request additional source documentation pertaining to the SAE 
from the investigational site.  If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study due to a n 
SAE, this information must be included in the initial or fo llow-up SAE report in the eCRF . 
Properly anonymized and de -identified documents (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], 
autopsy reports, and/or death certificates) as available will be provided to the CRO’s Drug 
Safety Department for all reported SAEs /AESIs . 
10.8. Choosing Adverse Event Terms  
Whenever possible, reported event terms for AEs (including SAEs) should be the names of 
medical events, not lists of symptoms or event outcomes.  Below are some examples of terms 
to avoid and more accurate alternatives.  
Examples of Terms to Avoid  Examples of More Accurate Terms  
Death (this is an outcome)  Fatal myocardial infarction (best choice)  
Death due to unknown cause, autopsy results 
pending (if no other information is available)  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (this is a serious criterion)  Myocardial infarction (best choice)  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581820], rule out myocardial 
infarction (if no other information is available)  
Chest pain, shortness of breath, 
diaphoresis, anxiety, left a rm pain  Myocardial infarction (best choice)  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], rule out myocardial infarction (if no 
other information is available)  
10.9. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring in a female subject or in a male subject’s partner while enrolled in this 
clinical study throug h [ADDRESS_765090] be 
reported on a Pregnancy Monitoring Form and sent to the CRO’s Drug Safety Department 
within 24 hours of the investigator, designee, or site personnel  learning of the pregnancy  
(refer to  Section  10.5). 
If a subject becomes pregnant while taking study drug, the study treatment will be 
immediately discontinued and the pregnancy must be reported within [ADDRESS_765091] and/or pregnant partner (or ensure such counselling 
is provided).  
An uncomplicated pregnancy will not be considered an AE or SAE; however, all pregnancies 
will be followed through birth and [ADDRESS_765092] will be reported as an SAE. The outcome of any pregnancy  and the presence or 
absence of any congenital abnormality will be recorded in the source documentation and 
reported to the CRO’s Drug Safety Department.  
The investigator will complete a Pregnancy Monitoring  Form and report the information 
regarding the pregnancy, outcome, and status of the newborn, as appropriate.  
Protocol Number GBT440 -[ADDRESS_765093]  deviation (SD), coefficient of variation 
(CV%, as appropriate), median, minimum, maximum, and, as appropriate, geometric mean.  
Categorical variables will be summarized  by [CONTACT_132075] (frequency) and 
percentage in each category.  
Data from Parts A and B of the study will be pooled across the common treatment arms, i.e. , 
GBT440 [ADDRESS_765094] s.  
The study will enrol l approximately 33 subjects : approximately 18 subjects in Part A and 
approximately 15 subjects in Part B.  
11.2. Populations for Analysis  
The following populations will be considered in the analysis of data for this study. 
Assignment or exclusion of subjects from the analysis populations will be performed prior to 
study unblinding . 
• Safety population : All subjects who receive any amount of study medication will be 
included in the safety population. Subjects will be analyzed based on medication 
received. This is the primary population for all safety analyses performed for this 
study.  
• Efficacy evaluable population : All randomized subjects who received at least 15 days 
of study drug treatment will be included in the Efficacy evaluable population.  The 
Efficacy evaluable population will be used for analysis of all secondary and 
exploratory efficacy endpoints, and subjects will be analyzed as treated.  
• PK population : All subje cts who receive investigational treatment and provide 
adequate data to evalu ate the relevant PK parameter.  
11.2.1.  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is the safety and tolerability of GBT440.  
Analysis will be based on data from all subjects  who were randomized and received at least 
one dose of study drug. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], laboratory evaluations, vital signs 
and ECGs. Data from these subjects will be used for analysis of all baseline demographics 
and safety summaries.  
11.2.2.  Secondary end points  
Analysis of data for secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on all randomized subjects 
who received  at least [ADDRESS_765095] 
1 dose of study drug.  Individual and summary blood pressures, heart ra te, ECG parameters, 
exercise testing endpoints and clinical laboratory data (hematology, serum biochemistry and 
coagulation) will be summarized . 
For the laboratory safety data, out of range values will be flagged in the data listings and a 
list of clinical ly significantly abnormal values will be presented.  
Adverse events and medical history will be tabulated and summarized according to the 
current version of MedDRA.  
11.3.2.  Efficacy Data  
For secondary and exploratory endpoints, binary data will be analyzed  via Fish er’s exact test. 
Data for other endpoints will be analyzed  with Wilcoxon’s test  or analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with baseline value as covariate . Full details of analysis methods , including how 
missing data will be handled,  will be provided in the SAP which will be finalized prior to 
study unblinding .  
11.3.3.  PK Data  
A listing of PK sample collection times as well as derived sampling time deviations will be

Exploration of exposure -response relationships of GBT440 to  exploratory efficacy data, and 
safety data (described below) will be performed as data permits.  
Protocol Number GBT440 -[ADDRESS_765096] (IRB)  and Regulatory Appro val 
The Investigator must inform, and obtain approval from, the IRB/IEC  for the conduct of the 
study at named sites, for the protocol, the Subject Informed Consent Form, and any other 
written information that will be provided to the subjects and any advert isements that will be 
used.  Written approval must be obtained prior to recruitment of subjects into the study and 
shipment of investigational drug.  
Proposed amendments to the protocol and aforementioned documents must be discussed 
between  the Sponsor and C RO, and then submitted to the IRB/IEC  for approval.  
Amendments may be implemented only after a copy of the local IRB approval letter has been 
transmitted to the Sponsor.  Amendments that are intended  to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented prior to receiving Sponsor or IRB/IEC  
approval.  However, in this case, approval must be obtained as soon as possible after 
implementation.  
The Investigator will be responsible for en suring that an annual update is sent to the IRB/IEC  
to facilitate their continuing review of the trial (if needed) and that the IRB/IEC  is informed 
about the end of the study.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_128455], subsequent approvals and final letter must 
be sent to the Sponsor.  
12.3. Insurance and Financial Disclosure

original reports of test results, investigational drug dispe nsing logs, correspondence, records 
of informed consent, and other documents pertaining to the conduct of the trial) must be kept 
for the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_8236].  Documents should be stored in 
such a way that they can be accesse d/data retrieved at a later date.  Consideration should be 
given to security and environmental risks.  
No trial document will be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor 
and the Investigator.  Should the Investigator wish to assign the tr ial records to another party 
or move them to another location, written agreement must be obtained from the Sponsor.  
12.8. Study Record Retention  
In accordance with 21 CFR 312.62(c), the investigators will retain records required to be 
maintained under this part for a period of [ADDRESS_765098] retain protocols, amendments, IRB/IEC approvals, copi[INVESTIGATOR_581821] 1572, signed an d dated consent forms, medical records, eCRFs, drug accountability

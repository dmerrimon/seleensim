1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
[COMPANY_012] Vision has a daily disposable multifocal conta ct lens, 1-DAY 
ACUVUE®Moist Multifocal, in the market place.  The lens is the only ma rketed soft 
multifocal lens to have its optical design optimized for the ch anges that occur in pupil size 
with refractive error.  There is a desire to evaluate a multifo cal contact [CONTACT_171180] a 
reusable modality.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate a multifocal optical design 
manufactured from senofilcon-A material using two slightly different manufacturing processes to determine if these differences have a significant impact on the on-eye 
performance of the lens.  
1.1. Name [CONTACT_171199]: JJV Investigational senofilcon A Multifocal Contact L enses. The lenses are 
manufactured in senofilcon A and use two different manufacturing processes.
1.2. Intended Use of Investigational Products
All lenses are intended to correct spherical refractive error and presby[CONTACT_19555].  The lenses are 
intended to be used as a 2-week, reusable, daily wear lens.  Th e lenses require use of a care 
system to clean and disinfect the lenses. 
1.3. Summary of Findings from Nonclinical Studies
All previous pre-clinical findings were deemed satisfactory pri or to proceeding with clinical 
trials on humans. For the most comprehensive nonclinical informa tion regarding JJV 
investigational senofilcon-A multifocal refer to the latest ver sion of the CR-[ADDRESS_200465] lens displayed good visual acuity with the mean distance an d 
intermediate logMAR acuity better than 0.0 and the mean near lo gMAR acuity better than 
+0.[ADDRESS_200466] binocular logMAR acuity of -0.082, -0.042 and 0.054 for distance, 
intermediate ,and near ,respectively.  There were two adverse events reported dur ing the 
study ;one that was non -ocular and not related to the test articles the other was an oc ular 
adverse event, contact [CONTACT_171181], that was classified as likely related to 
the study lens.  The event resolved with treatment and the su bject was discontinued from the 
study.  
 was a non -dispensing evaluation with a primary endpoint of logMAR visual acuity 
and contrast sensiti vity.  The lenses were compared to another investigational lens as well as 
the marketed [ADDRESS_200467] binocular logM AR acuity of -0.119,-0.099,
and 0.0 25for dis tance, intermediate ,and near ,respectively.  There was one non -ocular 
CR-6317, v 1.0 Page 17 of 163 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
adverse event (acute nasopharyngitis) reported in the study. Th e event was assessed as not 
related to the study treatment. There were no ocular adverse ev ents reported in this study.
The Test lenses have also been evaluated in  which as of the writing 
of this protocol did not have final clinical study reports.  For additional details refer to the 
Investigator Brochure for this study.

materials. 
4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
4.1. Description of Study Design
The clinical study is a randomized-controlled, double-masked, c rossover clinical trial.  There 
are two study treatments. A total of approximately [ADDRESS_200476] article will be dispensed for 3±1 days and an 
optimization visit will occur.  The final lens pair will be disp ensed for 12±2 days and the at 
CR-6317, v 1.0 Page 20 of 163 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
the follow-up the final lens measurements will occur.  Subjects  will complete a 7±[ADDRESS_200477] on the primary/secondary endpoints measured i n the study.    
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration
A total of approximately [ADDRESS_200478] Article Allocation 
The study lenses will be worn in a bilateral and random fashion  using a 2×[ADDRESS_200479] will randomly be ass igned to one of two unique 
sequences (Test/Control or Control/Test).  Randomization will b e stratified by [CONTACT_3725].
Permuted block randomization will be used to avoid bias in the a ssignment of subjects to 
treatment, and to enhance the va lidity of statistical compariso ns across treatment groups. 
Each block will contain two different lens trial sequences.
The order of lens wear will be based on the randomization scheme  assigned to the study site.  
The study site will follow the randomization scheme provided an d will complete enrollment 
according to the randomization list and will not pre-select or assign subjects.
5.2. Masking
This is a double-masked study with the subjects and the investi gators being masked. 
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until  all subjects have 
completed the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the mask should be broken only 
if specific emergency treatment/course of action would be dicta ted by [CONTACT_23792]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_35041].  In the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as 
CR-6317, v 1.[ADDRESS_200480] articles may be 
replaced at the discretion of t he Investigator and/or the Spons or.
6.4. Packaging and Labeling
The test articles will be packaged in blisters, as the primary packaging. The test article will 
be over-labeled to mask the subject to the identity of the lens.  The test articles will be in 
investigational cartons sealed with a tamper evident seal, comm ercial cartons, or in plastic 
bags as the secondary packaging form. The sample study label is shown below:
6.5. Storage ConditionsTest articles will be maintained at ambient temperatures at the  clinical site. Test articles must 
be kept under secure conditions.
6.6. Collection and Storage of Samples
When possible, any lens or test article associated with an Adve rse Events and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial w ith moderate solution pending 
directions from the sponsor for potential return to JJV.
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles
JJV will provide the Investigator with sufficient quantities of study article and supplies to 
complete the investigation.  The Investigator is asked to retai n all lens shipment 
documentation for the test article accountability records. 
Test article must be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessib le only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this  activity to authorized study 
site personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log.  All test art icles must be accounted.  This 
includes:
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear  out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits 
2. What was returned to the Investigator unused
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements  
CR-6317, v 1.[ADDRESS_200481]’s participation. Subject returned unused test articles must be separated from the 
clinical study inventory of un-dispensed test articles and must  be labeled with the subject 
number and date of return.  Following final reconciliation of t est articles by [CONTACT_2037], the 
Investigator or monitor will return all unused test articles to  the Sponsor.
If there is a discrepancy between the shipment documents and the  contents, contact [CONTACT_35501] .

xThe subject should not proceed to wear the 
lenses if any of the following is observed:
xpresence of limbal exposure (appearance of 
clear cornea) in any gaze
xpresence of edge lift
xpresence of unacceptable movement 
(excessive or insufficient) in all three
movement categories (primary gaze, upgaze, and push-up).
If either lens is deemed unacceptable, the subject will be discontinued from the study.  Remove the lenses, p
erform a slit-lamp
evaluation, and complete the Final Evaluation form.

10. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon identification of a  protocol deviation. Major 
protocol deviations must be reported to the sponsor within 24 h ours after discovery of the 
protocol deviation.  The Investigator will report deviations pe r IRB/IEC requirements.  All 
deviations will be tracked, and c orrective actions implemented a s appropriate. 
If it becomes necessary for the Investigator to implement a dev iation in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Investigator may imp lement the deviation 
immediately without notification to the sponsor. Within [ADDRESS_200513] notify and provide the rationa le to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB. 
11. STUDY TERMINATION
If more than [ADDRESS_200514] len s group develop serious expected 
(e.g., definite or probable MK) or unexpected device related adverse events, the study will be 
suspended. Upon review and consultation with IRB, DMC, and JJV s afety review committee, 
the study may be terminated. This potential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_171166] [ADDRESS_200515] lens for up to 3

JJV reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for an y reason.  Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreaso nable risk is determined.  The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_171168], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a di scussion with JJV, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.   JJV (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all ad verse events.  If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unreasonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting t he risk, will be terminated, a s soon as possible.
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as schedul ed), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_19566] l regulatory requirements.
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electr onic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, dur ability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have b een released for clinical trial 
use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources includin g but not limited to 
subjects, clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operatio ns managers (COM), medical 
monitors, and site personnel, etc. The following are not consid ered product quality 
complaints:
xSubject s atisfaction inquiries reported v ia “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO)”
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged af ter receipt at the 
investigational site
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall-outs
CR-6317, v 1.0 Page 51 of 163 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_171188] h andling by [CONTACT_28024], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, e tc.), only in situations 
where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_171189] [ADDRESS_200517] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic ema il notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases wh ere the EDC system in 
use is not configured to send automatic notifications or when a n EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery  that a PQC has occurred.  
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]:
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness)
xWho received the complaint
xStudy number
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone num ber)
xLot number(s)
xUnique Subject Identifier(s)
xIndication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or s ubject)
xOD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted
xAny related AE number if applicable
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.)
xEye Care Provider objective (slit  lamp) findings if applicable
xConfirmation of product availability for return (and tracking i nformation, if 
available), or rationale if product is not available for return  (Refer to F orm Control 
for test article return instructions)
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], C RA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (A E/SAE).  If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel wil l follow Section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product  quality related deficiency, 
these procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.   
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_779] i n error.  In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must 
be documented.
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laborato ry findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not re lated to the investigational  medical device. 
CR-6317, v 1.0 Page 52 of 163 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes events related to the investi gational medical device 
or the comparator.
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes events related to the procedu res involved.
Note 3 to entry: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices .”1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing conditio n) that:
1. Was not present prior to the study, but appeared or reappeare d following initiation of 
the study 
2. Was present prior to the study but worsened during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting from concomitant illnesses, reactions to co ncomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states
3. Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the 
clinical monitor and to the Sponsor immediately upon learning o f the event
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) –An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:
xResults in death
xIs life threatening
xRequires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171169]/incapacity (e.g ., a sight threatening 
event, a significant persistent or permanent change, impairment , damage, or
disruption to the subject’s body)
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect
xRequires intervention to prevent p ermanent damage (the use of t he test article 
resulting in a condition which requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude 
permanent impairment of the body structure or a body function).  Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or re quire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71154], based upon appropriate medical judgm ent, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or su rgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Serious Adv erse Events include, but not 
limited to:
xMicrobial Keratitis (MK)
xIritis (including cells in the anterior chamber)

CR-6317, v 1.[ADDRESS_200518]
xLimbal cell Damage leading to Conjunctivalization
Significant Adverse Events –Those events that are usually symptomatic and warrant 
discontinuation (temporary or permanent) of the test article (e xcluding Serious Adverse 
Events).  
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Significant Adverse Events include, but 
not limited to the following:

Non-Significant Adverse Events –Those conditions that are usually asymptomatic and 
usually do not warrant discontinuation (temporary or permanent)  of the test article.  
However, the Investigator may choose to treat as a precautionar y measure.  
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Non-Signifi cant Adverse Events 
include, but not limited to the following:
xNon-significant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)

which necessitates temporary lens discontinuation < [ADDRESS_200520] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse ev ent related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, inst allation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational medical device.
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the in vestigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_200521] (UADE) –Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or a ssociated with, the test article, 
CR-6317, v 1.[ADDRESS_200522], problem, or death was not previously identified  in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to 
ensure the events are categorized correctly.  Elements of categ orization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (see definition in Section 13.1)
xCausality or Relatedness –i.e. the relationship between the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures and the adverse event (not relate d; unlikely related; 
possibly related; related - s ee definition in Section 13.2.1)
xAdverse Event Severity –Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all events - see definition in 
Section 0)
xOutcome –not recovered or not resolved; recovering or resolving; recovered  o r  
resolved with sequelae; recovered or resolved; death related to a dverse event;
unknown
xActions Taken –none; temporarily discontinued; p ermanently discontinued; other
13.2.1. Causality AssessmentCausality Assessment –A determination of the relationship between an adverse event an d 
the test article. The test article relationship for each advers e event should be determined by 
[CONTACT_32981]:
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures
xUnlikely Related –An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely
xPossibly Related –An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test artic le, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. 
concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.   The relationship in 
time is reasonable.  Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded
xRelated –An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (de vice) or 
adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by a n alternative 
explanation, e.g. concomitant tr eatment of concomitant disease( s).  The relationship 
in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challeng e and re-challenge
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment –A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adver se 
event as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of test article, st udy treatment or study procedure 
relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following 
scale:
CR-6317, v 1.0 Page 55 of 163 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
xMild –Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and  does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities
xModerate –Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and  m a y  
interfere with the subject’s daily activities
xSevere –Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or altera tion of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) begins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatme nt, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medic al events reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse event s at the discretion of the 
Investigator.
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_19535]. He/she will complete the Adver se Event /eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adve rse events must be available i n the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic reactions not meeti ng the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form o r electronic data 
system. All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  
It is the Investigator’s respon sibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse 
event. All adverse events will b e followed in accordance with a pplicable licensing 
requirements.  Such documentation w ill include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom)
xDrawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the fin ding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.) 
xDate the clinical site was notified 
xDate and time of onset
xDate and time of resolution
xAdverse event classification, severity, and relationship to tes t articles, as applicable
xTreatment regimen instituted, including concomitant medications  prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements
xAny referral to another heal th care provider if needed
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any)
xLikely etiology
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will comple te the Corneal Infiltrate 
Assessment eCRF.  Where necessary , a culture of the corneal les ion will be collected to 
CR-6317, v 1.[ADDRESS_200523] returned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved.  If further treatment beyond lice nsure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider.  The Inves tigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event  will continue in the study.  
If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to record the reason for discontinuation.  The Investigator will a lso document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects  with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test article, study treatment or study pr ocedures, as of the final study 
visit date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse eve nt or until referral to an 
appropriate health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_11856]. Non-ocular adverse 
events that are not related to the test article, study treatmen t, or study procedures may be 
recorded as “ongoing” without further follow -up.
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by  e-mail, facsimile, or 
telephone as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from d iscovery for any serious 
/significant adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event.  
In addition, a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_39725] l Investigator to the IEC/IRB 
according to their requirements (Section 13.4.2).  The report w ill comment whether the 
adverse event was considered to be related to the test article,  study treatment or study 
procedures.
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/signifi cant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e-mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event.  The Investigator is ob ligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All subjects experiencing a serious/significant adverse event m ust be followed up and all 
outcomes must be reported.
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the random ization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received.  The S ponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Invest igator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately
CR-6317, v 1.[ADDRESS_200524]’s records all pertinent medi cal information and

whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test  article
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedu re according to 
national regulations
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effec t (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_200525] report the results of the
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_200526].
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non-serious adverse events, including non-serious adverse d evice effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from di scovery.
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting  must be reported within the
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer  to and follow any guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines. 
13.4.3. Event of Special Interest
None
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study w ill be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event.  Once discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes.  At t he Investigator’s discretion, the 
study participant may be followed by [CONTACT_171191] d elivery. However, this data 
will not be collected as part of the clinical study database.  Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_71179], but due to 
general concerns relating to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584].  S pecifically, pregnant women 
are discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or  visual acuity that occur 
secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforese en health risks to the 
mother or fetus.

14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed u sing the Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Thr oughout the analysis of 
data, the results for each subject/eye will be used when availab le for summarization and 
statistical analysis.  Unscheduled visits will be summarized se parately and will be excluded 
from the statistical analysis.
Summary tables (Descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables)  will be provided for all 
baseline variables, efficacy variables and safety variables as appropriate. Continuous 
variables will be summarized with  descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD],
median, minimum and maximum). Fre quency count and percentage of  subjects or eyes 
within each category will be provided for categorical data.Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_171192] (Safety Population or Per-Protocol Population). All analyses will be 
conducted on per-protocol population (see Section 14.3).  
14.2. Sample Size Justification
Historical study  tested hyp eropes in presby[CONTACT_171193]. The data from 
was used to estimate the sample size of the study. The rationale is the Test lens in 
has the same optical and mechanical designs, but a different curing method compared with 
both test article in this trial. 
Using the POWER procedure in SAS 9.4, the table below shows the  power to test the 
primary hypothesis with overall type I error 0.[ADDRESS_200527] s.
Primary Hypothesis: CriteriaTrue Difference 
(Test-Control) Power
CLUE Vision Test-Control>=-5 0 0.48

4 0.89
14.3. Analysis Populations
Safety Population:
All subjects who were administered any test article excluding su bjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation should  be recorded.
Per-Protocol Population: 
All subjects who have successfully completed all visits and did not substantially deviate from the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_19588] 
(Per-Protocol Population). Justification of excluding subjects with protocol deviations in the 
Per-Protocol Population set will be documented in a memo to fil e.
CR-6317, v 1.0 Page 59 of 163 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:
All subjects regardless of actual treatment and subsequent withd rawal from study or 
deviation from protocol. At least one observation should be reco rded.
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance
All planned analysis for this study will be conducted with an o verall type I error rate of 5%. 
14.5. Primary Analysis Primary efficacy analysis:
Overall quality of vision scores will be analyzed using a linea r mixed model adjusting for 
baseline values as fixed covariates. The model will include the  experimental design factors: 
sequence of lens wear, period, lens type, time point and intera ction between lens and time 
point as fixed effects. The covariance between residual errors from the same subject across 
lens wearing periods/time point will be selected based on the f inite-sample corrected 
Akaike’s Information Criterion .
6Covariance structures considered may include: 
Homogenous compound symmetry (CS) and Unstructured covariance s tructure (UN). The 
structure that returns the lowest Akaike Information Criteria C orrected (AICC) will be 
selected as the structure t hat best fit the data. 
Comparisons between the Test lens and Control lens at 2-week fol low-up will be carried out 
using 95% confidence intervals constructed of least-square mean s (LSM) differences (Test 
minus Control) from the linear mixed model. The non-inferiority  of the Test lens relative to 
the Control will be concluded if the lower confidence limit of L SM difference is above the 
non-inferiority margin -5. The superiority will be established if the lower confidence limit is 
above 0.
In all models, the Kenward and Roger method7will be used for the calculation of the 
denominator of degrees of freedom.
14.6. Secondary Analysis
Secondary efficacy analysis:
Binocular, high luminance, high contrast visual performance on logMAR scale will be 
analyzed using a linear mixed model to test for the difference between the study lens 
systems. Each model will include the experimental design factors: sequence of lens wear, lens wearing period, lens type, distance and the interaction be tween lens type and distance as 
fixed effects.  Other baseline characteristics known of importa nce such as age, gender, and/or 
add power will be included as fixed covariates when appropriate . Site and subject nested in 
site will be included as random effects when appropriate. The c ovariance between residual 
errors from the same subject at the same distance across lens w earing periods will be selected 
based on the finite- sample corrected Akaike’s Information Criterion .
6Covariance structures 
considered may include: Homogenous compound symmetry (CS) and U nstructured 
covariance structure (UN). The structure that returns the lowes t Akaike Information Criteria 
Corrected (AICC) will be selected as the structure that best fi t the data.
CR-6317, v 1.[ADDRESS_200528] lens and Control lens will be carr ied out using 95% 
confidence intervals constructed of least-square means (LSM) di fferences (Test minus 
Control) from the linear mixed models. The non-inferiority of t he Test lens relative to the 
Control will be concluded if the upper confidence limit of LSM difference is below the non-
inferiority margin 0.[ADDRESS_200529] clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dr opout is systematic or not -at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitivity ana lysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the proportion of subject dropou t is greater than the 15%. The 
SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized  with a 
parametric regression method used t o make at least [ADDRESS_200530] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ARCHIVING

APPENDIX E: PRESBY[CONTACT_19602]
1. Do you notice that you often have to hold things farther away  so that you can read 
them?
2. Do you notice that you often have difficulty focusing on near  objects (i.e., 
experiencing blurry vision when looking at things close-up)?
3. Do you often have headaches or eyestrain, or feel fatigued, w hen reading or 
conducting other near activities?
4. Do you often have difficulty reading small or fine prints, su ch as phone books, 
medicine bottles or package labels, etc.?
5. Do you often have difficulty reading under dim or low light?

APPENDIX G: TEST LENS FITTING GUIDE  
Step 1.
Choose the first lens based on th e best spherical equivalent re fraction and ADD power for 
both eyes.   Select the first lens per table 1 below.  
Table 1.  Initial Lens Selection  
ADD
+0.75 +1.00 +1.25 +1.50 +1.75 +2.00 +2.25 +2.[ADDRESS_200540]’s vision at distance and near after the lens has settled (10 minutes).  If the 
vision is acceptable continue with the fit assessment and dispe nsing as per the protocol.  
If the vision is not acceptable, ensure that the proper initial lens power was selected by [CONTACT_746] a distance over-ref raction with +/- 0.25D trial lense s (or flippers) to determine if 
a change in the initial lens power is required (note:  the over -refraction should be performed 
outside of the phoropter in normal room illumination).  Recheck  both distance and near 
vision with the over-refraction i n place.  If a change in the i nitial lens power is not required 
refer to the fitting steps listed below in step 2 (table 2).  
Step 2.

lens power on the non-dominant ey e (see example below).  
Example:  The subject is a +1.75 ADD and has a near complaint a nd it is determined a 
change in lens pairs is needed.  Referring to table 2 near comp laint section, under 
the +1.75 ADD it states to keep the dominant eye the same (i.e.  MID) and add 
+0.25D to the non-dominant eye (i.e. MID+).       
Subjects spherical equivalent distance refraction  
OD: +2.50
OS:  +3.00 (OS non-dominant eye)
The new lens chosen should be as follows:
OD: +2.50 MID ADD (i.e. no change) 
OS:  +3.[ADDRESS_200542]’s vi sion is still not 
satisfactory, and additional optimizations are allowed by [CONTACT_941] p rotocol, lens changes may be 
attempted, based on the Investigator’s clin ical experience, to determine i f acceptable vision 
can be achieved.

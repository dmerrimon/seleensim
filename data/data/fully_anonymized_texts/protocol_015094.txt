simple activity monitor and feedback application. Both interventions will include self-monitoring and feedback 
through the mobile apps and additional feedback through weekly brief counseling phone calls. Thus, 
comparing the two interventions will allow the investigators to draw conclusions about the unique motivating 
aspects of the narrative games. A follow -up assessment at 12 months will further allow investigation of 
intervention effects on activity maintenance over time. The study will address the following specific aims:  
Aim 1. Compare a motivationally enhanced intervention to a standard intervention in a [ADDRESS_1053789] cancer survivors (N = 120) will 
be randomized to the enhanced intervention or to a standard intervention. We will test objective measures of 
physical activity, physical function, and fitness at the conclusion of interven tion contact (6 months) and after a 
6-month maintenance phase (12 months).  
Aim 2. Compare quality of life and psychological outcomes across the two interventions at 6 and 12 
months . We will investigate quality of life  (physical, social, emotional, function al, and breast -related) , 
depression, anxiety, and fatigue at 6 and 12 months.  
Aim 3. Compare autonomous motivation across the two interventions at 6 and 12 months.  Hypothesized 
psychosocial predictors (Self -Determination Theory constructs and narrative tr ansportation) will also be 
investigated . 
Aim 4. Investigate the cultural appropriateness of the two interventions.  At the 6 month assessment  or 12 
months assessment (if not collected at 6 months) , we will conduct brief interviews with participants (N = 120) 
and stakeholders (N = 10) to investigate acceptability of  intervention components. Qualitative analyses will 
examine racial and ethnic differences.  
We hypothesize that the narrative -based enhanced intervention will produce greater increases in activity, 
physiological outcomes, and quality of life outcomes as compared to a standard intervention. This study will 
provide crucial information to inform future research and practice related to cancer control and survivorship 
care. Its results will provide the fo undation for future efficacy and dissemination studies with the potential to 
quickly and significantly improve public health at a population level.

(e.g., those based on SCT that target self -regulation, self -efficacy, etc.) are effective, but adherence decreases

include motivating game mechanics and persua sive narratives hold promise as a medium for delivering such 
an intervention. Below, we discuss the theoretical background and rationale for a game -based study,  
B.1. Theoretical framework: Self -determination theory   
Figure 6.1. Conceptual model                               The theoretical framework for this 
intervention (see Fig. 6.1) includes 
constructs from Self -Determination Theory 
(SDT) and theories of narrative 
transportation.  
SDT proposes a continuum between 
autonomous and controlled motivation,47,48 
with autonomous motivation being more 
strongly associated with physical activity 
over time.13,14 Autonomous motivation for 
activity includes both completely intrinsic motivation (that is, motivation in the absence of  external 
rewards/demands) as well as integrated and identified regulation (relatively autonomous forms of motivation 
that involve valuing the outcomes of activity). According to SDT, autonomous motivation is predicted by [CONTACT_768342] n eeds for competence, autonomy, and relatedness.[ADDRESS_1053795] produced excellent results, including long -term maintenance of 
physical activity49 and weight loss.50,51 
B2. Narrative tra nsportation  
Narrative transportation (also called narrative engagement) occurs when an individual is mentally immersed in 
a narrative storyline. Transportation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_768319] a story.52 Narratives can increase enjoyment and motivation generally22,23 and specifically towards physical 

American Cancer  Society, Inc.   
Version# 2 04/01 /[ADDRESS_1053796] narratives, as they combine the suspense and 
enjoyment of a sto ry with the autonomy of creating a personalized experience.54 Further, active video games 
may be a powerful medium for such storytelling, as embodied role -play ( physically acting out the story) could 
amplify feelings of autonomy and mastery.55,[ADDRESS_1053797] information provision.57 This persuasion is implicit and emotional 
rather than overt and analytical, which may produce more enduring effects.52 It is possible that active video 
games with a compelling narrative could persuade players that they are competent,  via identification with 
competent characters.58,59 Role-play as a fit character could also increase perceived competence via social 
cognitive means, by [CONTACT_768343], modeling, and mastery experiences.60  
Narrative also has the power to change behavior by [CONTACT_768344]’ attitudes and beliefs. Identification 
with characters can lead to “trying on” their personality traits and values.59,61-[ADDRESS_1053798] found 
that part of their appeal is their potential to fulfill the se psychological needs,71,72 and that games that increase 
these perceptions more are more likely to be played again in the future.73 For example, games can encourage 
autonomy by [CONTACT_768345].74,75 They can encourage perceptions of competence (similar to self -
efficacy) via modeling, practice, role -play, verbal persuasion, and mastery experiences.[ADDRESS_1053799] in fluenced disappointing results of a large -scale dietary intervention.81 Thus, racial/ethnic

lupus found that individualization was one of the reasons they enjoyed using an active video game.[ADDRESS_1053801] their experiences and who resemble them.84,85 Effects of narratives on health 
behavior appear to be greatly influenced by [CONTACT_768346]. The more characters resemble the 
reader /viewer/player, the more effective the narrative.[ADDRESS_1053802] effects in intermediate outcomes – typi[INVESTIGATOR_768320]. Using 
physical activity as an outcome at an early stage in intervention development is very important, as large -scale 
trials often fail to show health outcome changes due to failures  to produce sustained behavior changes in 
activity.[ADDRESS_1053803] cancer survivors. In the short term, the study will provide valuable information about 
the potential of mobi le technology for improving health behaviors, intermediate health outcomes 
(cardiovascular fitness, physical function etc.), and mood. In the longer term, the results of the study have the 
potential to improve cancer control on a large scale, and ultimatel y decrease the morbidity and mortality of  BC. 
If the intervention is ultimately successful, it could be included in survivorship care plans as a standard tool for 
improving physical activity, benefiting millions of survivors and lowering overall cancer bur den. Because the 
intervention was designed to be easy to individualize, similar programs could easily be targeted to other 
cancers or chronic conditions.  
D. INNOVATION  
This project is an innovative step forward for the discipline in several ways: 1) The prima ry focus of the 
intervention is activity maintenance, with a strong theoretical rationale for each intervention component’s effect 
on long -term change. To our knowledge, this will be the first large -scale investigation of the use of video game 
mechanics in  an intervention among older adult cancer survivors. This strategy holds potential for a large 
American Cancer  Society, Inc.   
Version# 2 04/01 /[ADDRESS_1053804] but has received little research attention. 2) The individualized and user -centered nature 
of the intervention may be able to address barrie rs that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in physical activity 
rates and health outcomes. 3) The intervention incorporates tailoring and patient -centered outcomes in a way 
that does not decrease the potential ease of dissemination. The applications w ill allow for simple customization 
and autonomous choices.  
E. PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
[CONTACT_768371] has extensive experience in the areas of technology and physical activity. The research mentors 
have been carefully chosen to complement these strengths and to fill g aps in knowledge and experience. The 
major areas of preliminary evidence for this research study are outlined below.  
E.1. Video games and physical activity   
In her previous studies, [CONTACT_768371] has found that significant differences exist across active video  game types in 
both energy expenditure and enjoyment89 and that enjoyment of an active video game predicted energy 
expenditure.90,91 Comparison of a “game” themed around exercise simulation (jogging) and a game themed 
around a true game (hula hoopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) found that framin g an activity as a playful game produced greater 
enjoyment than did simulating an exercise activity.[ADDRESS_1053805], she has recently 
analyzed the results of a large (N = 1053) survey of BC survivors r egarding technology and health promotion. 
Breast cancer survivors reported using computers and the Internet (86%), and were more interested than other 
cancer survivors in computer (36%) and mobile interventions (though interest in smartphone interventions was 
low, 12%). In fact, interest in computer interventions was greater than interest in clinic or telephone based 
interventions.  
A series of focus groups and interviews with postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (N = 20, 4 ethnic/racial 
minority ) found t hat these apparent low levels of interest in smartphone interventions were informed by 
[CONTACT_473588]’ expectations. For example, one participant stated that she did not like video games or smartphones. 
Later in the discussion, she mentioned playing Angry Birds  on her tablet. She saw no contradiction in these 
two statements, echoing attitudes of many of the other participants. They did not count the kinds of casual 
video games that they played as “video games,” nor did they believe that other mobile devices (tab lets, iPods) 
and smartphones were similar. Thus, some video games and mobile devices are actually highly acceptable to 
older adult breast cancer survivors, despi[INVESTIGATOR_224127] -reports (such as in the above study) that suggest the contrary.  
A pre-experimental pil ot study (N = 10, 4 ethnic/racial minority) using mobile devices in older adults included 
two women who were long -term BC survivors. The study protocol, which involved provision of a tablet and 
activity monitor, was found to be feasible and acceptable over  the brief intervention period (6 weeks). 
Participants wore the monitors as instructed and synced their data daily or multiple times per day. Adherence 
was very good, with monitors worn and synced 402 out of a possible 420 days. Participants significantly 
improved their fitness and function compared to baseline. Measures of acceptability showed that participants 
found the tablet, monitor, and application to be useful and enjoyable.  
An additional pre -experimental pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (N = 10, 3 ethnic/racial minority) is investigating one of the games to be 
used in the proposed study ( Zombies, Run! ). We provided smartphones with the game app to adult women (18 
– 69), six of whom were over 55. The study is not yet complete, so we cannot estimate adherence . However, 
qualitati ve acceptability measures taken at the midpoint  indicate two major reported reasons for non-
adherence: preference for using the participant’s own phone and preference for measuring lifestyle activity 
rather than (or in addition to) planned activity. All pa rticipants had no problems using the smartphones provided  
and reported finding the game and story very motivating. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_768321], the requirements 
surrounding use of the game were felt to be onerous . Unlike in the above trial, participant s were required to 
remember to turn on the app prior to planned walking bouts. Several women mentioned forgetting to carry a 
second phone (since they already had their own cell phone), or felt that the requirements to remember a 
second phone and to remembe r to turn on the app were burdensome . We hypothesize that using a non -
smartphone mobile device  (like an iPod or iPad) , allowing use of participants’ own phones, and providing a 
choice of apps that include lifestyle monitoring  (i.e., that doesn’t require pr e-planned activity bouts ) would 
improve adherence.

F.1. Overview and study flow  
The primary purpose of the SMART GOAL (Self -Monitoring Activity: a Randomized Trial of Game -Oriented 
AppLications) study is to investigate the impact of an e nhanced motivational physical activity intervention 
among sedentary postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT; N = 120) comparing the enhanced intervention to a standard self -monitoring intervention. The enh anced 
intervention will consist of provision of two active video games and a mobile device on which to play them. 
Participants will also receive weekly brief counseling/check -in calls.  The standard intervention will consist of 
provision of an electronic a ctivity monitor and a mobile device, with the same phone call content and schedule.  
The trial will be conducted over the course of three years, in three yearly cohorts. Participants in the trial will 
each attend four visits: a baseline assessment/orientati on one week later , an initial counseling/goal -setting  Games  Monitor

and 12 months will be monitored as a maintenance period, to determine whether behaviors are maintained in 
the absence of further counseling. Participants will receive $25 gift cards at  the 6 month and 12 month 
assessments for a total of $50 incentive. They will also keep the mobile device as an additional incentive. The 
flow of the trial is displayed in Table 6. 3. This pattern will be repeated for each cohort.  
Personnel conducting the s tudy will include a clinical research coordinator and two graduate research 
assistants. The research coordinator and one of the graduate research assistants will perform counseling calls, 
oversee monitor data, and provide technical assistance, while the ot her research assistant (blinded to 
participant group assignments) will conduct assessments. During the maintenance phase of this intervention (6 
– 12 months), the research coordinator will continue to make monthly phone and mail contact [CONTACT_768347] (e.g., thank you and reminder postcards, calls to check for changes in contact 
[CONTACT_3031]). No counseling content will be offered during these contacts.

F.3. Participants and procedure (Aims 2 – 4) 
For the trial, we will recruit participants in three cohorts of 40 participants each, 20 per group, with 
oversampling of African American and Hispanic women (at least 30% of the sample). Participants will be 
randomly assigned to receive an enhanced or a s tandard intervention. Major eligibility criteria will include 
female gender, postmenopausal status (cessation of menses for at least 12 months), aged 45 -75, current 
inactivity (< 90 minutes moderate -vigorous activity per week), BMI > 25 and < 40, no psycho logical issues that 
would interfere with study completion, ability to walk for physical activity, safety of physical activity, and not 
currently using the monitor/application to be provided. The PAR -Q+ will be used to screen for potential 
contraindications  to exercise 132. Endorsement of any of its items will require physician clearance to participate 
in the study.  
Based on incidence data from the [LOCATION_007] Cancer  Registry, we estimate that approximately [ADDRESS_1053809] 
cancer survivors aged 55 – [ADDRESS_1053810] 10 years currently live in Galveston county, 500 of 
whom are African -American or Hispanic. We will also sample from nearby [CONTACT_181662] (includ ing Harris county, 
which includes Houston). [CONTACT_768372] -Engquist successfully recruited a sample of [ADDRESS_1053811] cancer survivors in 
two years for a physical activity intervention study112 (37% African American and Hispanic) as well as larger 
samples for cross -sectional research (36% African American and Hispanic).29 Recently, 6 of 10 older adults 
recruited for a similar study were African American or Hispanic. Thus, we believe our recruitment targets of 40 
per year for three years and 30 - 40% minority recruitment ( 12 or more  per year) to be feasible. We will u se a 
combination of advertisement, community engagement,  pre-screen via medical record for eligibility  and clinic -
based solicitation to recruit potential participants. We will sample from Galveston as well as other nearby 
[CONTACT_181662] (including at UTMB and MD  Anderson clinics in Harris county, which includes Houston , and up to 
Victoria County ). The clinical research coordinator also coordinates a UTMB program that encourages 
recruitment of ethnic/racial minorities into clinical trials, and has ample experience  in recruiting from local 
communities.  
F.4. Enhanced i ntervention  
The intervention consists of several complementary components:  
1) Provision of a mobile device (iPod Touch) with armband and headphones  
2) Provision of one mobile game application  
3) Provision of online currency  (e.g., iTunes gift cards)  to purchase music to be used in the game ($50)  
4) Brief counseling phone calls that occur weekly for 3 months, then monthly until 6 months  
American Cancer  Society, Inc.   
Version# 2 04/01 /2020  Page 9 of 28 Participants will be able to use their own smartphone devices shou ld they wish to; however, we will provide an 
iPod Touch mobile device to ensure that they have access to a device compatible with the chosen apps. (It will 
also serve as an incentive, as iPod Touches can hold much more music and data than most smartphones and 
take high -quality pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].) The iPod Touch is similar to an iPhone, but does not require cellular service for use 
and is primarily an app and music use device. Thus, we believe that it should be perceived as a more 
acceptable mobile device than a smar tphone, despi[INVESTIGATOR_768322]. In our preliminary studies 
(see pages 6.5 - 6.6) we found that smartphone -based interventions are acceptable among older women, but 
that allowing use of their own phone and/or providing a non -phone mobile dev ice is preferred.  
The game to be used is Zombies, Run! , created by [CONTACT_768350]. Th is gam e was chosen due to its 
unique blending of an involved narrative storyline with game mechanics and extensive interactive behavioral 
tools. Zombies, Run!  is a game that encourages bouts of 30 – [ADDRESS_1053812] commonly used in the game , and Figure 6. 2 shows 
screenshots of the game. Players use the mobile device to set up the game, but during exercise the device is 
held or worn on the arm (armbands and headphones are included with the mobile device ). The game plays 
user-chosen music and places clips of an audio narrative in between those songs, to provide an illusion of 
other characters “radioing in” while the player travels by [CONTACT_768351] a post -apocalyptic world. While songs are 
played, the game provides audio cues when players “pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049] ” virtual supplies or are chased by [CONTACT_768352]. 
Zombie chases (which can be turned off) require players to increase their speed by 20% for one minute in 
order to out -run their pursuers. If the zombies catch the player, they “drop” some of their virtual suppli es to 
distract the zombies and escape.  
The game consists of over 120 missions in the main storyline, with complementary side missions that provide 
additional insight into some of the characters. Additional missions will be released in April, 2015 , so the 
storyline is long enough to sustain activity over the year -long period. The narrative is written by a professional 
writer and includes main characters of multiple genders and races. The player character is never referred to by 
[CONTACT_768353] -person as “you” or “Runner 5.” Players can assume that their 
character is any gender, race, ethnicity, etc. Participants in the preliminary study reported high levels of 
parasocial interaction with the two main non -player characters (one of whom is an African -American woman).  
Thus, we believe that this narrative will be appropriate for testing hypotheses related to 
transportation/engagement.   
*Please note: A similar game called The Walk  will be pre -loaded onto the iPod device. During orientation,  
interventionists will briefly reference it as a potential back -up should participants find the content of Zombies, 
Run! aversive. The Walk  is made by [CONTACT_768354], but the story is 
different and less violent. Our i ntent is for participants to use Zombies, Run!,  but we will provide the option of 
The Walk  as a backup for cases in which participants feel strongly that they cannot use the zombie game.  
Counseling content for the narrative game group was adapted from the narrative counseling used in the PACT 
study133 and extended to include appropriate constructs of interest in this study . Discussions will draw from the 
Zombies, Run!  game and make suggestions related to future play. For example, some se ssions will call 
participants’ attention to the exercise imagery they engage in during walking sessions, and others will 
encourage participants to imagine their ideal selves when playing as their character. Participants in this group 
will also receive the basic counseling provided to the self -monitoring group that covers self -monitoring, 
feedback, action -planning, and problem -solving.

 F.5. Self-monitoring  Intervention  
Participants randomized into the s elf-monitoring  intervention will receive  a walking app preloaded onto an iPod 
touch device, headphones and an armband for using the device, and $55 in credit towards purchasing music 
and/or additional in -app features. The app Runkeeper (FitnessKeeper, Inc. , [LOCATION_011], MA ) was chosen because 
it includes the self -regulatory tools typi[INVESTIGATOR_768324]/running apps without additional game - or narrative -related 
components. Users set up music playlists to listen during walks and indicate when they wish to begin and en d 
their walk. On the iPod, the app measures length of time as well as steps us ing the device’s accelerometer. 
Participants may a lso enter additional self -reported information, such as their mood upon completing the walk.  
Counseling will include standard s elf-regulatory skill building content from interventions based on Social 
Cogni tive Theory, addressing behavior change techniques  related to goal -setting, self -monitoring, feedback, 
problem solving, and action planning. In order to ensure that equal attenti on is offered to both intervention 
groups, counselors will spend additional ti me with the self -monitoring group participants by [CONTACT_768358][INVESTIGATOR_768325] (e.g., longer discussion of 
comparisons to past performance along with a guided tour through the app’s walkin g logs). The purpose of the 
extra time spent with these participants is to match the time spent in the narrative and game group discussing 
narrative -specific topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  
F.6. Measure ment  
Table  6.5 displays information on the physiological and anthropometric ou tcomes to be assessed. Physical 
activity will be m easured objectively using Actigraph wGT3X BT monitors. Wear time will be seven days at 
American Cancer  Society, Inc.   
Version# 2 04/01 /2020  Page 13 of 28 each assessment point. Because continuous  measurement is not feasible, a week -long sample will be taken at 
the three as sessment periods. Estimates will be valid if the m onitor is worn ≥ 10 hours per day on ≥ 4 days . 
Non-wear time will be determined by 60 or more of consecutive minutes of zero activity counts. Based on 
criteria used for the NHANES surveys, epoch length will be one minute, and activity counts over 2020 per 
minute will be considered moderate -vigorous intensity .134 Physical activity will be measured as minutes per 
week of moderate -vigorous intensity  activity . Measurements from the mobile devices will also be abstracted 
and used as an exploratory se condary measure of physical activity. A validated and widely used self -report 
measure (CHAMPS) will also be used to estimate total caloric expenditure at all time points, including follow -
up. The objective measure of minutes per week  (measured by [CONTACT_768359]) at 6 months will be the primary 
endpoint of the study, with the self -report measure providing additional insight into activity types and overall 
caloric expenditure.  
Specific quality of life -related outcomes (depression, pain interference, anxiety, se lf-reported function, and 
sleep disturbance) will be measured using PROMIS computer adapted testing at 0, 6, and 12 months.135 
Participants will be emailed links to the assessment website (which stores information by [CONTACT_768360] a 
secure server). All item banks for each construct include a number of items. The computer adapted testing 
procedure uses item response theory to determine which items are shown to partic ipants based upon their 
previous responses. No more than [ADDRESS_1053817] will ever need to be answered by [CONTACT_4317]. Table

Intermediate outcomes  
We hypothesize in our conceptual model that several motivational and identity variables may mediate 
the relationship between group assignmen t and physical activity. Exercise identity will be measured using the 
Exercise Identity Scale ,141 a 9-item scale with subscales of exercise role identity (“Others see me as someone 
who exercises regularly”) and exercise beliefs (“E xercise is something I think about often”).  Responses range 
from 1 (“Strongly disagree”) to 7 (“Strongly agree”). This measure is widely used with a reported Cronbach’s 
alpha of .94, and several factor analyses have confirmed this factor structure .142,143 
 Motivation will be measured using the 19 -item Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire -2, 
which measures external (“I exercise because other people say I should”), introjected (“I feel guilty when I don’t 
exercise”), and identified regulation (“I value the benefits of exercise”), amotivation (“I don’t see why I should 
have to exercise”), and  intrinsic motivation (“I exercise because it’s fun”) .144 We will also include four items to 
measure integrated regulation (“I consider exercise a fundamental part of who I am”), which is not traditionally  
included in exercise measures but which has been found to be an important predictor of exercise behavior .145 
Responses are provided on a 5 -point Likert scale from 0 (“Not true for me”) to 4 (“Very true for me”). The 
complete questionnaire with integrated regulation questions has shown reliability (between 0.70 and 0.93 for 
the subscale s) and predictive validity .145 A psychometric investigation showed discriminant va lidity between 
integrated regulation and exercise identity; though similar, these measures represent conceptually different 
latent constructs .143 
Other variables  
We will measure several other variables in the conceptual model that relate to games and narrative. 
Narrative transport ation will be measured using Green and colleagues’ Narrative Transportation Scale .146 A 15-
item version will be used, which will include four items related to “imagery” th at are specific to characters in the 
game (“While playing the game, I had a vivid image of Sam Yao”) as well as the standard 11 items relating to 
cognitive (“I was mentally involved with the game while playing it”) and affective (“The game affected me 
American Cancer  Society, Inc.   
Version# 2 04/01 /2020  Page 14 of 28 emot ionally”) aspects of transportation. Responses will be provided on a seven -point Likert scale with anchors 
“very much” and “not at all.” This scale is widely used and has demonstrated reliability (alpha > .70) in previous 
experiments using video games147 and diverse samples of adult women viewing cancer -related narrati ves.[ADDRESS_1053819] use of the Presence Self -Assessment Manikin as a crude indicator of immersion 
applicable to both applications. This measure consists of a row of  five pi[INVESTIGATOR_768326] a nine -point 
Likert scale and has demonstrated predictive validity in a previous study of narrative video games .149 The 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_768327] a figure at various distances from a TV screen. Respondents are told that “the pi[INVESTIGATOR_768328] a 
person who feels he or she is inside the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], a part of the story, a part of the action on the left end, to a 
person who feels he or she is outside the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], removed or separated from the story, not part of the action 
on the right end.”  
The Exercise I magery Questionnaire is a widely -used measure that includes three subscales: 
appearance (“I imagine a leaner -me from exercising”), techniques (“When I think about exercising, I imagine 
my form and body position”), and energy (“To get me energized, I imagin e exercising”) .150 An additional 
subscale related to enjoyment (“When I think about exercise, I imagine myself having fun while exercising”) will 
be included .151 The resulting scale has 12 items and responses range from 1 (“Never”) to 9 (“Always”). 
Cronbach’s alphas ranged between 0.[ADDRESS_1053820] 
found relationships in the expected directions; for example, appearance imagery predicted controlled 
motivation, whereas enjoyment and technique imagery predicted autonomous mo tivation151. 
Character identification cannot be accurately compared across groups, as the monitoring app does not 
include characters. To provide a proxy for ch aracter identification, we will use the procedure described by 
[CONTACT_768361]/using the app .61 Participants will complete the Ten Item Personality Inventory with reference to their ideal 
self (at baseline), then regarding themselves while using the app (other time points). Correlations between 
ideal self and game -self for each of the items will be averaged, with neuroticism items reverse -coded, to create 
a number between -1 and 1 that indicates ideal -self and walking -self convergence. This convergence will be 
considered a proxy measure of the extent to which identific ation with the player character led to “trying on” of 
her characteristics.  
The Play Experience Scale is a 16 -item scale made up of four subscales: freedom (“I was able to make 
the game do what I wanted it to”), no extrinsic (“I was not worried about someon e judging how I performed in 
the game”), play -direct (“I would characterize my experience with the game as playing”), and autotelic -focus 
(“When I was using the game, I was focused on the task at hand”). Responses range from 1 (“Strongly 
disagree”) to 6 (“ Strongly agree”). This is a relatively new scale with few published studies using it, but it has 
demonstrated reliability (alpha > .80) and convergent validity with intrinsic motivation (r = .79) .152 
The Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale will measure autonomy (“I feel that the way I exercise 
is the way I want to”), competence (“I feel that exercise is an activity which I do very well”), and relatedness 
(“My relationships with the people I exercise with are very friendly”). Responses  to this 11 -item scale use a 1 – 
5 Likert scale (“I don’t agree at all” to “I completely agree”).  Reported alphas for the subscales were 0.[ADDRESS_1053821] studies, for ex ample to investigate the relationship 
between perceived competence and exercise role identity (partial r = 0.20) .142 
At baseline, demographic information will be collected regarding gender, race, and age. Cancer -specific 
information will also be collected regarding time since diagnosis, type/stage of breast cancer, and type of 
treatment.  Participants will complete the Transportability Scale to investigate t heir tendency towards narrative 
transportation.154 We will include treatment status as a covariate in our outcomes models to take into account 
any variability associated with treatment status . 
 
Acceptability and process  measures  
  
 
Acceptability and usability items will be adapted from Vandelanotte and colleagues .155,156 Process measures 
for both groups will include logs of completed counseling phone calls, attrition, and adverse events. Objective  
process measures will also be recorded from the two apps. Zombies, Run!  and Runkeeper will  send exercise 
session information to the Runkeeper  service, where an interventionist account will “friend” the participant’s 
account. (Participants will not have a ccess to the Runkeeper account.) Number of walks per week, total 
minutes per week, and steps during walks per week will be abstracted from the website.  
American Cancer  Society, Inc.   
Version# 2 04/01 /[ADDRESS_1053822] the option to complete them on paper or on a sec ure 
website. The same website that houses PROMIS measures can be adapted to include our other questionnaire 
items for those who choose the Internet option.  
At the 6 month assessment  or 12 month assessment (if not collected at 6 months) , participants will d iscuss 
intervention acceptability and individualization during in -depth interviews , which have been recommended as a 
method for improving the cultural sensitivity of interventions .[ADDRESS_1053823] in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_768329]. Results of these interviews will be used to further adapt the intervention for better 
cultural sensitivity.  Table 6.7  shows example questions.  
Table 6.7. Selected questi ons from interview guide  
Topic  Question  
Individualization  Did you feel that the app was something you could easily adapt to fit your needs and preferences?  
 Is there a way the app could have been better designed to be more appropriate for you or someone like you?  
Narrative  How much did you feel like the characters in the game resembled you?  
 Did playing as the main character make you feel differently about yourself?  
F.7. Power and sample size  
This study is powered to detect differences between the two groups in minutes of moderate -vigorous physical 
activity at 6 months. We used G*Power to calculate sample size based on several studies that are similar to 
this one. Similar t rials of telephone counseling and activity monitoring among BC survivors produced  effect 
sizes ranging from 0.[ADDRESS_1053824] size for physical 
activity at 6 months of approximately d = 0.65, which would require an N of 78 for 80% power at an alpha of 
0.05. This effect size transl ates to a between groups difference of approximately 20 minutes per week  (SD =  
30 minute s). An N of [ADDRESS_1053825] of physical activity even in the case of 20% attrition  
and higher variability than expected (i.e., lower effect size) .  
Similar studies that investigated maintenance are so few (three to our knowledge) and show such disparate 
results that power was difficult to calculate for this effect. For example, Rogers et al. report large differences in 
change scores between groups fr om baseline to the end of maintenance (79 vs. -22 minutes per week; 3 
month follow -up),161 whereas Vallance et al. report smaller differences (24 vs. -14 minute s per week; 6 month 
follow -up).[ADDRESS_1053826] group differences during the maintenance period as well.  
F.8. Statistical analysis   
The primary endpoint of thi s study will be behavioral change in physical activity at 6 months (Aim 1). Our 
primary hypothesis is: Participants who receive the enhanced  interventi on will spend more minutes per week in 
moderate -vigorous  physical activity  at [ADDRESS_1053827] the difference between groups at 6 months, controlling for 
baseline. Missing data will be imputed. As a secondary analysis, w e will  use linear mixed modeling to 
investigate changes in physical activity over time at baseline,  6, and 12 months . This procedure will provide 
necessary information for powering a subsequent larger trial that will require complex modeling of multiple time 
points. We will also use multiple im putation techniques prior to all analyses to ensure that missing data due to 
attrition do not bias our results. Analyses will be performed using SAS  9.2 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). [CONTACT_768371] and 
the research assistants will conduct all analyses in collaboration  with biostatisticians from the biostatistics key 
resource in the Institute for Translational Sciences. Outcomes and effect sizes for other variables will be 
assessed using the same protocol.  
Interviews with participants and stakeholders will be transcribe d and coded by [CONTACT_768362]. Code lists 
will initially be derived from Self -Determination Theory and theories of narrative transportation. Then, coders 
will use grounded theory to derive codes based on themes brought up by [CONTACT_4317].[ADDRESS_1053828].92 NVivo qualitative software will be used to code and compare codes across 
American Cancer  Society, Inc.   
Version# 2 04/01 /[ADDRESS_1053829]’s progress.  
F.10.a. Recruitment difficulties.  First, w e may h ave difficulty recruiting a sufficiently large sample.  We will 
approach appropriate cancer and volunteer registries for recruitment such as  the UTMB cancer registry  and 
MD Anderson registries (email and/or phone calls).  We have partnered with several area  volunteer groups 
through which we plan to recruit, and we have budgeted for continuous newspaper, radio , and television  
advertisements  throughout the three year data collection period . UTMB has extensive resources for assisting 
with recruitment,  including  volunteer registries and  a recruit ment core . If we fell behind schedule in recruitment 
progress, we would  increase our efforts and expand recruitment to include neighboring counties (including 
southern Harris County, location of Houston , and up to Victori a County ) and additional UTMB and M.D. 
Anderson clinics . Recruitment from M.D. Anderson clinics is  feasible , as long drives are very commo n in the 
Houston -Galveston area.  Recruitment of MD Anderson patients will occur in person at MD Anderson and joint 
MD Anderson/UTMB clinics as well as by [CONTACT_648] (following the same procedures used to identify UTMB 
patients to approach , except by [CONTACT_768363] -person ). For the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_768330]. Lyons is currently 
conducting, many participants live in surrounding areas ≥ 30 minutes’ drive away from UTMB but are still 
willing to come in for assessments . The Breast Health Center at UTMB’s mainland facility (approximately 30 
minutes from Galveston and 30 minutes from downtown Houston) offers the opportunity to conduct 
asses sments closer to Houston . We will accommodate based on location and travel convenience.  We have 
collaborated with oncologists at various clinics to expand our effort in recruitment. A HIP AA waiver request 
form has been completed. With the oncologists appro val, we will pre -screen patients via medical records for 
eligibility. The oncologists will refer their patients. We will not approach patients unless we have oncologists 
and patients permission.   
We have allowed additional time during the five -year award period such that if recruitment is not complete in 
the first three years, we can continue data collection through the fourth year and still have one year for analysis 
and dissemination. If absolutely necessary, we can expand our inclusion criteria to inclu de women with other 
cancers ; we do not anticipate this being necessary, however.  
F.10.b. Retention difficulties. The intervention and maintenance periods of the study together equal [ADDRESS_1053830] information, and collection of information on friends/family who can be listed as 
secondary contacts in case contact [CONTACT_19297] a participant changes unexpectedly.  We will send a Thank 
you/holiday card during the study participation.  
F.10.c.  Technical difficulties.  The monitors and/or application may present technical obstacles to some less 
tech-savvy participants. We will provide extensive technical assistance as needed. We will be available by 
[CONTACT_768355] (whi ch we will log and measure), and will provide in -depth illustrated 
instructions with troubleshooting tips and frequently asked questions as part of the manual.  We will allow up to 
one in -person meeting for technical support.  We will reschedule an assessmen t visit twice if necessary . Based 
on our interventions  thus far with older adults using tablets and smartphones, we believe that technical issues 
will not be so great as to reduce feasibility or acceptability.  In case of a broken/lost ipod, we will lend on e ipod 
for the duration of the study . We will  also replace a lost charging cord one time if necessary . 
F.10.d. Phone Calls /Communication . The calls will be generated by [CONTACT_768364] 3 months 
and monthly until 6 months (we will call two tim es within 15 minutes of weekly counseling phone call and 
arrange one make -up per week if necessary) from their randomization date. Staff will view the list on a weekly 
basis to make sure that calls are made on time. Once the call has been successful and th e forms completed, 
or after [ADDRESS_1053831] phone call 
and if it was successful. If a counseling call lasts longer than 20 minutes, we will end the call as quickly as 
possible. We will  reply to texts/emails/phone calls during business hours for technical problems or to schedule 
calls/assessments. After hours texts or calls will only occur if pre -arranged for the purposes of pi[INVESTIGATOR_768331] -hours counseling calls. We may contact [CONTACT_38439], text, or email to schedule 
appointments, the day before an appointment as a reminder, and if we have a question or concern regarding 
their participation such as following up on questionnaire responses or adverse events. Additional 
calls/texts/emails may  occur to schedule droppi[INVESTIGATOR_768332] 6 month and 12 month 
American Cancer  Society, Inc.   
Version# 2 04/01 /[ADDRESS_1053832] period, with the 
final year dedicated to data clea ning, evaluation, dissemination, and intervention protocol refinement (or, in the 
case of delays, completing data collection as well). The timeline for the award period is displayed in Table 6. 8.

Results d issemination (manuscripts, gran ts)                     
Deliverables for this project include conference presentations, published manuscripts, counseling scripts, study 
protocols, and grant applications. We anticipate at leas t one publication related to the study per year, with 
potential examples shown in Table 6. 9. Because this trial uses novel technology -based methods, is one of few 
studies that includes a maintenance period, and is fully powered on its primary behavioral ou tcome, we expect 
the outcomes papers to be published in high -impact journals. Targeting high -impact medical journals that are 
read by [CONTACT_768365] (e.g., JAMA Internal Medicine, J Clin Oncol,) is part of our 
strategy for speedin g dissemination. Ancillary papers on motivation, qualitative results, and methodology will 
be submitted to well -regarded discipline -specific journals.  Data or specimens collected in this research might 
be de -identified and used for future research  or distr ibuted to another investigator for future research without 
your consent .   
Table 6. 9. Examples of potential manuscripts based on study findings  
Upon completion of data collection for the randomized controlled trial, we will draft an application for an 
independent research award (e.g., R01, Research Scholar Award, etc.) to fund a follow -up project. The 
intervention content will be modifi ed based on process and outcome evaluation findings. The larger sample 
and funding of such an award will allow adequate power to detect differences in more distal health outcomes 
over longer intervention and maintenance periods, to formally test mediation,  and to investigate moderation by 
[CONTACT_545]/ethnicity. Our overarching goal is to create a successful program that can eventually be incorporated into 
survivorship care plans and implemented on a large scale. The preliminary data provided by [CONTACT_768366], in combination with the training activities discussed elsewhere in this application, will provide the 
necessary foundation upon which a truly disseminable program can be built.   Year  Paper subject

Randomization details  
Participants will be randomi zed using sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Group assignments 
will be written on pi[INVESTIGATOR_215001], placed under a pi[INVESTIGATOR_607690], wrapped in aluminum foil, and then 
sealed one per opaque envelope. The envelopes will be then thoroughly sh uffled and numbered sequentially. 
Envelopes will be assigned to participants after baseline assessment (which will occur after orientation) in 
order of presentation by a member of the research team blinded to the original randomization process. The 
partici pant’s ID number will be written on the envelope to ensure that the carbon paper serves as an audit trail.  
Questionnaire content  
Table s 6.[ADDRESS_1053834]. For measurement within the 
enhanced group, we will use the Transportation Scale,146 which is widely used in the literature, and the 
Narrative Engagem ent Scale,164 which provides subscales that may point to interesting areas for future work 
(narrative understanding, attentional focus, narrative presence, and emotional engagement).  To compare the 
two groups, it was necessary to use a more general measure of presence (also known as engagement or 
immersion). Table 6.[ADDRESS_1053835]

Week 3. Uncovering Barriers   
[Discuss exercise progress report  abstracted from application – ask for totals from the feedback screen(s)]  
Last session we discussed findin g times to fit in exercise. You mentioned that you wanted to try fitting in exercise 
______________. Did you try it? Did you develop plans for the rest of the week? (YES NO)  Were you able to fit 
in exercise in times that you hadn’t before? What were they? _________________________________  
We are going to use something called the IDEA process to examine ways to overcome barriers to exercise. The 
IDEA process stands for Identify, Develop, Evaluate, and Analyze. Let’s choose one barrier and problem -solve 
that b arrier.  
I-Identify problem.____________________________________________________  
D- Develop creative solutions. What are some possible solutions? (just brainstorm as many as you possibly can) 
________________________________________________________________ ____  
E- Evaluate the solutions and select the one you are most likely to implement and develop a specific plan to 
implement._____________________________________________________________________  
Which solution do you think would be the easiest for you to im plement? This week try implement _____________ 
and we can review next week.  
A- After implementing, analyze how well it worked and revise if necessary .  
HMWK: This week, think about the barrier that you chose and implement the plan. Next week we will analyz e 
how the plan went.

 1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the 
applicable  federal  regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures.  
 
1.1 Background  
 
Recurrent aphthous  stomatitis (RAS), or canker sores, represents a very common mucosal disorder, occurring in 
men and women of all ages, races and geographic regions and affecting up to 60% of North Americans.[ADDRESS_745246] ‘aphthous’  originates from the Greek word aphtha referring to an ulcer of the mucosal surface and 
‘stomatitis ’ refers to inflammation of the oral mucosa. Patients suffer from simple aphthosis, meaning they 
develop only occasional canker sores a few times per year which are a nuisance, but are not otherwise a difficult 
problem . 
 
However, a subset of individuals with RAS  suffer from a severe variant with persistent, refractory ulcers which 
may be present more often than not. This sub set of canker sore sufferers tend to have more painful, persistent 
canker sores which may be larger, with multiple lesions occurring synchronously. These ulcers can take several 
weeks to heal, and as one epi[INVESTIGATOR_176378], another bout of ulcers develops. P atients often have ulcers present 
more than 50% of the time, and go from one epi[INVESTIGATOR_567379]. 
 
Severe RAS (ulcers present more often than not/multiple, large ulcers/present synchronously/ slow to heal) – is 
sometimes referred to as "complex aphthosis" a term suggested by [CONTACT_567394]2, experts in the field of 
oral dermatology. Such patients are otherwise healthy, with no systemic disease and few to no comorbid 
conditions. It is tho ught that this phenomenon may represent an "up regulation" of the immune system.3 Attacks 
of RAS may be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_567380], stress, food intake, drugs, hormonal changes and vitamin and trace 
element deficiencies.1 Local and systemic conditions, and gen etic, immunological and microbial factors all may 
play a role in the pathogenesis of RAS.1 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
 
Otezla (a premilast) 30mg .  
 
1.[ADDRESS_745247] of clarification , – severe RAS (or complex aphthosis) – is quite discrete from Behç et’s disease, which 
also is characteristically associated with oral ulceration. In contradistinction, Beh çet’s disease is a rare, chronic, 
multisystemic disorder characterized by [CONTACT_567395], ocular, vascular and central nervous system 
6/21/2017  
Alison Bruce, MD  Page 7 
 manifestations, and is  thought to be  a systemic vasculitis.4 The clinical spectrum is wide and may include  oral 
and genital ulcers among the  many clinical features. The etiopathogenesis of Behçet’s disease remains 
unknown, although genetic predisposition, environmental factors and immunological abnormalities have been 
implicated.5 The prognosis of Beh çet’s disease is very different and may be guarded depending on the extent of 
the systemic v asculitis and treatment may be  lifelong. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_567381] çet’s 
disease, it is postulated that treatments that attenuate the mucosal manifestations of Beh çet’s may also be 
effective in management of severe RAS . 
 
A phase 2, double -blind, placebo -controlled study was publis hed in [ADDRESS_745248] to be 
effective in treating the oral ulcers manifested in Beh çet’s disease.6 Given that oral ulcers are the cardinal 
manifestation of Beh çet’s disea se, it has been suggested that a premilast may also be effective in patients with 
severe RAS.  
 
To date, there has been one case7 reported in which a pat ient with RAS was treated with a premilast. This was a 
male in his 60’s with a history of recurrent oral ulcers for [ADDRESS_745249]  in patients with severe RAS, as it may 
represent a safe and effective alternative to current management options . 
 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
 
Based on the safety and effi cacy of previous studies using a premilast for Beh çet’s dise ase and psoriasis, t he 
dose of a premilast 30mg was chosen for the present study.  Subjects will receive a premilast 30mg twice daily for 
[ADDRESS_745250] 
infection , hypersensitivity reactions  and depression.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective  
• To evaluate the efficacy of a premilast for the treatment of RAS.

All subjects who complete the active treatment phase are to enter the 8 -week posttreatment observational 
follow -up phase.  
 
3.1.1 Contraception Education  
 
The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilas t are not known at this time.  Results of the animal and 
in vitro studies can be found in the IB.

in section 4.1.[ADDRESS_745253] (IP) and for at least [ADDRESS_745254] of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant 
changes at the time of study entry or at any time during the study, th e Investigator will educate the subject 
regarding options and correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully 
prevent pregnancy.

Statistical Plan  
6.2 Sample Size Determination  
 
A total of 15  patients will be enrolled in this study. T his sample size will be sufficient in order to gain valuable 
data that could be used in the design of a future, larger study. Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility nature of the study, no 
formal power calculations were performed.  
 
6.3 Statistical Methods  
 
Data Analysis – Given the design, all statistical analysis will be descriptive . Continuous outcome measures will 
be summarized using the sample mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 25th and 75th percentiles, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized wi th number and percentage. 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) will be  estimated where appropriate.  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
 
We will summarize continuous variables using the sample mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 25th 
and 75th percentiles, and maximum. We will summarize categorical variables with number and percentages. 
Ordinal variables will be summarized using the s ample median, minimum, 25th and 75th percentiles, and 
maximum, as well as with number and percentage.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
 
Given the prospective nature of the study, we expect to encounter little if any missing data. However in the 
event of missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; missing data will 
be treated as missing.  
 
Multiplicity  
 
No adjustment for multiple testing will be made owing to the exploratory, pi[INVESTIGATOR_109248].  
 
Primary Hypothesis : 
 
We hypothesize that a premilast  administration  for RAS  will decrease the number of ulcers at the end of 
treatment compared to baseline.    
 
The primary endpoints of the study is the change in number of ulcers at the end of treatment compared to 
baseline.  
 
The seconda ry endpoints of the study, occurrence of adverse reactions and morbidity, are both dichotomous 
categorical variables. As such, the proportion for which these outcomes occur will be estimated along with 95% 
confidence interval .

7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychol ogical, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including 
individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse 
experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or pr olonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or 
significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new 
information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or 
others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e., unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential 
risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an 
underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" wh en it was unforeseeable at the time of its 
occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an 
increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the r esearch procedures.  
 
 
Adverse Event  
 
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, device, biologic) 
in a patient or research subject.  
 
 
Serious Adverse Event  
 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well defined and 
include;  
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_567388], new, or prolonged;  
• disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant birt h defect/anomaly  
6/21/2017  
Alison Bruce, MD  Page 17 
 • important medical event  
 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life threatening or 
result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgi cal 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.   
 
or other events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -investigator may have adversely affected the rights, 
safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the re search data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is 6 months  after enrollment. The  adverse event monitoring 
period will end at th e end of the follow -up period. If an event is reported after this time it would need to be 
determined whet her or not it is study related.  
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the  
study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of 
the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definiti on of an adverse event must 
also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_456] -investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the sponsor -
investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor -investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the 
subject, or the subject’s personal physicia n, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if it was exhibited as a severe 
reaction i.e. swelling, that required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_567389].  
 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28688] a serious adverse event unless specifica lly instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an 
adverse event.   
 
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in 
the following circumstances:

immediately in the source document, and al so in the appropriate adverse event section of the case report form 
(CRF) or separate worksheet.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or 
procedure results should recorded in the source document.  
 
All adverse events occu rring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study 
treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of 
the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome.

study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and/or log.  The sponsor -investigator 
will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up and reporting required.  
The SAE must be rep orted immediately (i.e., within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event) to 
Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_6972].  A written report (prepared by [CONTACT_737](s) using an SAE Report Form or a 
3500A Medwatch form  is to be faxed to Safety (see below  for contact [CONTACT_3031]).

7.3.1 Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of 
a female subject or the female partner of a male subject  occurring while the subject is on study drug, or within 
[ADDRESS_745270]’s last dose of study drug, are considered immediately reportable events.  Study drug is to 
be discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused po rtion of the study drug to the 
investigator(s).  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene 
Safety immediately facsimile using the Pregnancy Report form provided by [CONTACT_27718].

 7.3.2 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: n otifying the Mayo IRB  
The sponsor -investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68258] -UPI[INVESTIGATOR_137136].  
7.[ADDRESS_745271] along with consultation between 
the study team and th e IRB.  
7.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction a nd 
implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 - “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and 
Inspecting”).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse 
events.  
 
[ADDRESS_745272], and stored into a REDCap 
database.  
 
Variables to be collected include: (please list variables to be collected, at different time points if applicable)  
8.[ADDRESS_745273] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the 
ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that h ave 
revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least 
vital status (long term survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
Hard copy data such as consent  forms will be stored in locked file cabinets; electronic data will be stored in 
secure web -based database (REDCap) that will be designed with the help of the statistician.  
8.3 Source Documents  
Source data are all information, original records of clinical fin dings, observations, or other activities in a clinical 
trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  
Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], cl inical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded 
data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_567391] 
6/21/[ADDRESS_745274] files, and records 
kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
Data Management  
Study data will be managed in a study specific REDCap system  
 
Data Security and Confidentiality  
 
The REDCap system has built in systems for control of access, data integrity and audit trails. Access and 
confidentiality are controlled in a manner similar to other institutional system s.

investigator will permit monitori ng, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], Mayo internal auditing , and government 
regulatory agencies  of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data 
collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the  capability for inspections of applicable 
study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_93515] c ompliance offices.

concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the sponsor -investigator before commencement 
of this study.  
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent form 
will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_14884].  The formal consent of a 
subject, using the Approved IRB consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study

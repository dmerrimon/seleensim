https://myirb.wusm.wustl.edu/summary/projects.page?mode=pf&OID=109499392 3/9an interv ention. The interv ention aims to prompt screening for financial distress, facilitate discussions about care costs
with cancer patients, support health insur ance selection, and ultimately reduce cancer patients’ financial to xicity
associated with cancer care [1-3]. This interv ention is an online decision tool called I Can PIC (Impro ving Cancer
Patients’ Insur ance Choices). 
This study will ev aluate I Can PIC’ s impact on patient care among newly -diagnosed patients with gynecologic, colorectal,
or lung cancer . At the start of Aim 2, we will conduct a historic control surv ey of [ADDRESS_500113] a
pi[INVESTIGATOR_397441] I Can PIC, then complete a surv ey after their next oncology
appointment. 3-6 months from recruitment, patient participants will complete a follow -up surv ey. 3 and 6 months after
beginning recruitment, we will giv e the pro viders real-time feedback about how often they screened for financial distress
and referred patients to I Can PIC.
1.4 Specif y your research question(s), study aims or h ypotheses:
We propose to modif y the I Can PIC decision aid based on stak eholder feedback and to implement it as part of usual
care, along with screening for financial to xicity and cost discussions. 
 
The goal of this study is to ev aluate the refined I Can PIC’ s impact on gynecologic, colorectal, and lung cancer care
using a between subjects design.
1.5 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project:
Cancer patients often pa y substantial out -of-pock et costs for care, with some spending as much as 10-20% of their
annual income on healthcare expenses [4,5]. Some new cancer ther api[INVESTIGATOR_397442], of
which a large portion can fall on patients [6,7]. In a recent study of 9.5 million cancer patients, more than 40%
depleted their sa vings and assets within two y ears of diagnosis [8]. Out -of-pock et costs are rising due to longer
surviv al times, rising prices of new cancer treatments, and insur ance cost -sharing increases [5]. Financial to xicity
can exacerbate health disparities; those with low income and those uninsured or underinsured ha ve more difficult y
managing the costs of cancer treatment and adhering to care plans [9, 10]. 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_397443]’ o verwhelming concerns about care costs, pro viders often miss opportunities to discuss costs with
them [11,12]. Although costs often impact cancer patients’ treatment decisions [13], particularly when treatments
lead to similar health outcomes [14], costs are not often included in patient materials. Discussing out -of-pock et
expenses with patients can lower their costs without impacting cancer outcomes [15]. Y et pro viders often feel
inadequately tr ained to ha ve cost con versations. Pro viders often hesitate to address costs of care because costs can
vary consider ably across patients [11,16]. In our prior work, fewer than half of pro viders discussing breast cancer
surgery addressed relativ e costs of treatment. 
 
We also found that patients without guidance find it difficult to choose an adequate health insur ance plan [17-19],
particularly when viewing monthly premiums and plan features without a cost calculator . Lower health insur ance
literacy and suboptimal insur ance led man y to dela y or forgo needed care [19, 20]. 
 
We dev eloped and tested I Can PIC to help cancer patients understand insur ance terms and options, consider care
costs, talk to pro viders about financial needs, and identif y financial resources or insur ance to help offset care costs. I
Can PIC pro vides plain language education at an accessible reading lev el, uses Medical Expenditure P anel Surv ey
(MEPS) data to estimate annual costs patients might incur across plan t ypes, and allows users to input their plan
details to compare cost.

For the historic control surv ey, the WU research staff will screen the patients of participating pro viders through EPIC to
identif y potentially eligible patients. They will retriev e the phone numbers and mailing addresses of potentially eligible
patients so WU research staff can contact [CONTACT_476]. When possible based on appointments scheduled in adv ance (e.g. , not
same-da y add-ons), WU research staff will mail potential participants a letter explaining the study’ s purpose and
procedures so they ha ve background about the study to review before being approached for consent. A week after
mailing the letter , WU research staff will contact [CONTACT_397456] b y telephone to review the study and assess interest and
eligibilit y. To confirm eligibilit y, WU research staff will ask for the potential participants’ age, comfort reading and writing
in English, cancer diagnosis, and time since cancer diagnosis. 
 
If the potential participant is eligible and interested, WU research staff will ask if the participant would prefer to
complete the surv ey in-person, o ver the phone, or online at home. If the participant chooses to complete the surv ey
over the phone, WU research staff will review the phone consent information sheet with the participant. If the
participant chooses to complete the study online, WU research staff will record their permission to send them emails,
and send them a test email to confirm the email giv en is correct. Once staff receiv e confirmation from the participant
they will send a link to the surv ey, in which the consent information is on the first page of the surv ey. The participant
will indicate consent b y clicking to the next page. If the participant chooses to complete the surv ey in-person, WU
research staff will review the informed consent document when they meet with them in person in a priv ate room. The
potential participant can tak e as much time as they would lik e to consider their participation. 
 
For the second part of this study , the study populations include 15 BJC medical or surgical oncologists who treat patients
with gynecologic, colorectal, or lung cancer , and 80-100 of their patients who ha ve been diagnosed with gynecologic,
colorectal, and lung cancer . Participating pro viders will giv e their permission for WU research staff to review their
patients’ medical records and contact [CONTACT_395936] . 
Eligible pro viders will be identified b y the WU study team. The WU study team will contact [CONTACT_397457] b y phone or
email to assess interest. F or eligible and interested pro viders, WU research staff will review the consent information o ver

At the start of this study , we will conduct a historic control surv ey of [ADDRESS_500117] participants' distress assessment data, insur ance
status and other health conditions data from the electronic medical record in EPIC. A t the time of enrollment, WU
research staff will confirm participants’ contact [CONTACT_3031] (telephone/address). If they giv e us permission to email
them we will document this in our records. They will receiv e a $[ADDRESS_500118] as a thank y ou for their time. 
 
Then, we will tr ain 15 BJC gynecologic, colorectal, and lung cancer care pro viders in using I Can PIC and discussing
costs with patients in a brief 15 min presentation that can be deliv ered in-person or virtually . Providers will complete a
survey before and after their brief tr aining at the start of the study . These surv eys will tak e appro ximately 5-10 mins to
complete in total. During the study , at 3- and 6- months, we will giv e providers on the percent of time that they
screened for financial distress and referred patients to I Can PIC. This information is collected from the patient
participants' surv eys. A t the end of the study , we will examine adoption, implementation, and maintenance measures.
Providers will receiv e a $[ADDRESS_500119] at the end of the study . 
 
Next, we will recruit 100 gynecologic, colorectal, and lung cancer patients of the pro viders we tr ained o ver a 9 month
period. A t the time of enrollment, WU research staff will confirm participants’ contact [CONTACT_3031] (telephone/address). If
they giv e us permission to email them we will document this in our records. Next, they will use I Can PIC. This will tak e
appro ximately 10-15 mins. After their next appointment with their pro vider, they will complete a brief surv ey online
about their knowledge of health insur ance and confidence communicating about care costs. WU research staff will
provide their surv ey to participants via phone, email, or in-person. The surv ey will tak e about 10 mins. P articipants will
receiv e a $[ADDRESS_500120] participants' distress assessment data, insur ance
status and other health conditions data from the electronic medical record in EPIC. After 3-[ADDRESS_500121] participants' distress assessment data, insur ance status and other health conditions data from the electronic

the participant (if an y)
benefits to societ y (if an y)
There are no direct benefits to participation. Our goal is that the knowledge gained will benefit cancer patients and
surviv ors in the future who are managing health care costs. P articipants ma y feel a sense of contribution to their
communit y and to others. They could also learn about health insur ance terminology and care costs resources
through participating in the study . 
 
The results of this study will inform efforts to implement I Can PIC in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42619]. Giv en that risks to
participants are minimal, they do not outweigh these potential benefits.
1.22 Provide a summary of the analysis methods y ou will use, including, if applicable, the data points or outcomes y ou
will analyz e.
Descriptiv e statistics will be calculated for all v ariables and RE- AIM outcomes. Data will be examined for
effectiv eness outcomes between historic controls and interv ention groups in a multiv ariable regression model
controlling for up to 4 independent co variates (e.g. age, health liter acy, insur ance status, cancer t ype). The 3-6

the first time point (after viewing I Can PIC) and the 3-6 month follow -up will be examined in a multiv ariable
regression model controlling for up to 4 independent co variates (e.g. age, health liter acy, insur ance status, cancer

Pain Outcomes of Intra -operative IV Tylenol and/or Toradol for Carpal Tunnel and Distal 
Radius Fracture Surgeries  
NCT 02313675  
Initial IRB approval: 5/11/[ADDRESS_683629] recent IRB renewal: 1/25/[ADDRESS_683630], PRO14110464. It was registered with 
Clinicaltrials.gov, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. Patients were recruited from the clinical practice of the senior 
author and enrolled in the study if consented to undergo endoscopic carpal tunnel release. The 
following exclusion criteria were used: current pregnancy, allergy to acetaminophen or 
ketorolac; medical contraindication to acetaminophe n and/or ketorolac; pre -operative/current use 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; history of IV drug abuse; workers’  compensation.  
The Investigational Drug Service (IDS) at our institution randomized subjects using a blocked 
computerized randomization protocol and dispensed the s tudy medication. The four treatment 
arms include: placebo (Group 1), IV acetaminophen (Group 2), IV ketorolac (Group 3), or both 
IV acetaminophen and IV ketorolac (Group 4). The dose of ketorolac was [ADDRESS_683631] weight -based titration of propofol. After adequate se dation, the senior author 
injected a mixture of 5 mL of 1% lidocaine and 5 mL of 0.5% marcaine into the surgical field for 
intra-operative procedural anesthesia. All carpal tunnel releases were performed using a single 
incision endoscopic technique.  
All pa tients received the same standard post -operative prescriptions for pain management: 
Tylenol 1000 mg by [CONTACT_19793] 8 hours, naproxen 500 mg by [CONTACT_19793] 12 hours, and 
oxycodone 5 mg by [CONTACT_19793] 6 hours as needed for severe pain rated as more than 7 ou t of 10 
on an 11 -point pain scale (0 -10). Each oxycodone prescription was for 20 tablets and no refills 
were authorized. Pain surveys were distributed to the subjects on the day of surgery and the 
subjects were instructed to complete the surveys every 8 ho urs for 7 days after surgery. The 
subjects also noted the number of oxycodone tablets consumed per day.

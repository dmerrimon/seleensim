Injury to the ankle syndesmosis is commonly associated with rotational ankle fractures, occurring in 
23-52% of cases1-4. Accurate syndesmotic reduction and stabilization of the ankle mortise has been 
shown to correlate with improved functional outcomes in these patients1,4,5. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_820014], syndesmotic malreduction remains common1,6. Use of the 
contralateral, uninjured ankle as a template for the reduction of the injured ankle syndesmosis by 
[CONTACT_820016]. al has sho wn the lowest malreduction rate of 6% (1 / 18 patients), however, CT scan of 
the uninjured ankle was not used as comparison7. Use of intraoperative CT scans can also reduce the 
rate of syndesmotic malreduction but can be cumbersome and is often unavailable  or unfamiliar to 
the surgeon8. Intraoperative [ADDRESS_1136336] scan-like images,  yet operates  like a conventional  C-arm. 
This prospective, observational study will enroll patients with unilateral, unstable, rotational ankle 
fractures with preoperative or intraoperative evidence of syndesmotic instability to assess ability of 
3D fluoroscopy to aid in accurate syndesmotic redu ction. Patients with syndesmotic instability will 
undergo reduction of the syndesmosis followed by [CONTACT_820017] a clamp or Kirshner 
wire. The reduction quality will be initially compared to the contralateral ankle mortise and talar - 
dome later al radiographs using the technique of Summers7. After the attending surgeon is satisfied 
with the reduction quality, 3D fluoroscopy will be used to generate additional images to assess 
syndesmotic and fibular reductions. The number of times that the surgeo n changes the reduction of 
either the syndesmosis reduction (primary outcome) or fibular fracture reduction (secondary 
outcome) because of information provided by 3D fluoroscopy will be recorded. Fixation of the 
syndesmosis by [CONTACT_820018] a standard fashion. A limited postoperative bilateral ankle CT scan will be performed  to 
assess the accuracy of  reduction.

Hypothesis  
We hypotheses that intraoperative 3D fluoroscopy will frequently lead the surgeon to change the 
reduction of the syndesmosis and/or fibular fracture and that the use of novel 3D fluoroscopy 
technology will yield a low rate of syndesmotic malreduction.  
Specific Aims  
Specific aim #1: Identify the frequency where intraoperative 3D fluoroscopy leads to a change in the 
syndesmotic reduction after using the standard technique of contralateral ankle fluoroscop ic imaging 
by [CONTACT_820019]7. 
Specific aim #2: Describe use of 3D fluoroscopy in assessment of ankle and syndesmotic reduction 
quality to the orthopedic community.  
Specific aim #3: Ascertain patient functional outcomes using Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical health outcomes on patients at [ADDRESS_1136338] commonly by [CONTACT_820020] (uninjured) radiographs to assess fibular length, rotation, and syndesmotic 
reduction. Some authors suggest direct open visualization of the syndesmotic reduction at the time of 
fixation. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_820015] d escribe the use of 3D fluoroscopy and feasibility of use 
intraoperatively for acute ankle syndesmotic injury.  
Methods  
Study design : 
A prospective, observational study proposes to enroll patients with unilateral, unstable, rotational 
ankle fractures with preoperative or intraoperative evidence of syndesmotic instability to assess 
ability of 3D fluoroscopy to aid in accurate syndesmotic reduction. Patients with syndesmotic 
instability will undergo reduction of the syndesmosis followed by [CONTACT_820017] a clamp 
or Kirshner wire. The reduction quality will be initially compared to the contralateral ankle mortise 
and talar -dome la teral radiographs using the technique of Summers7. After the attending surgeon is 
satisfied with the reduction quality, 3D fluoroscopy will be used to generate additional images to 
assess syndesmotic and fibular reductions. The number of times that the sur geon changes the 
reduction of either the syndesmosis reduction (primary outcome) or fibular fracture reduction

 (secondary outcome) because of information provided by 3D fluoroscopy will be recorded. Fixation 
of the syndesmosis by [CONTACT_820021] a standard fashion. A single postoperative bilateral ankle CT scan will be performed to 
judge the accuracy of the injured ankle reduction to the uninjured ankle, the current gold  
standard. The patient outcome variables studied will include American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle 
Society (AOFAS) scores at 3 and 6 months as well as use of PROMIS patient physical health 
outcome measures using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) so ftware survey system. 
Subjects unable to return to clinic for their 3 and 6 month follow -up visits will be asked to complete 
the AOFAS over the phone with the researcher. At that time, they will be asked for their e -mail 
address and sent a link to complete  the PROMIS survey.  
Study Subjects : 
Inclusion criteria  
• Patients 18 -75 years of age, skeletally mature;  and 
• Patients with unilateral, acute, displaced ankle fractures with preoperative evidence of 
syndesmotic  disruption  or intraoperative  evidence  of syndesm otic instability  following  malleolar 
fixation.  
Exclusion criteria  
• Patients skeletally  immature;  
• Patients less than age 18 years and more than age  75; 
• Patients with previous ankle trauma to either  ankle;  
• Patients with bilateral ankle  injuries;  
• Patients with previous osseous injuries to the tibia or fibula;  and 
• Patients  with isolated  syndesmotic  injury  and no fracture  (i.e. high ankle  sprains)  
 
 
Sample Size:  
 
In 2015, 40 patients were treated operatively for a syndesmotic disruption at Memorial Hermann 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. For patient enrollment collection over 8 -9 months, the estimated sample size is 30 patients.  
 
Data Collection / Handling:  
Data will be collected and ma intained by [CONTACT_2710], residents, fellows, and faculty from the 
Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. The orthopedic trauma fellow (B.C.) will be primarily 
responsible for data handling and storage. Data will be stored in locked departmental research  
facilities and on password -protected networks and devices of departmental research personnel and 
residents. When the data collection is complete, patient identifiers will be removed prior to the 
sharing of data for statistical consult and analysis.

 Data Analysis:  
Injury radiographs and intraoperative fluoroscopy will be reviewed by [CONTACT_820022] -trained orthopedic traumatologists to identify patients with acute syndesmotic 
instability in as sociation with ankle fractures.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS. Continuous variables will be 
presented as a range, with mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables will be expressed as 
percentages. Logistic regression and multivariate analysi s may be used to assess significant 
associations between predictor variables. A p value of <0.05 will be used for the significance testing.

Benefits  
This novel technology is beginning to be used in orthopedic trauma to improve 3 -dimensional 
understanding of complex injures. This study may lead to improved syndesmotic reduction and 
possibly improved patient reported functional out comes.

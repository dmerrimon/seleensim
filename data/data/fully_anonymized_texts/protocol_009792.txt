Consistent with the goals of PAR -12-279 “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_678850] (R34) ” this R34 
proposal seeks  to improve the delivery of evidence- based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for childhood 
anxiety disorders with a recently developed smartphone application,  Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach . This 
application has the potential to 1) increase access to high qual ity care beyond the brick and mortar mental 
health setting; and 2) improve the quality and efficiency of face -to-face therapy by [CONTACT_678970].  
Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders in childhood with prevalence rates as high as 
15%, but the least likely to be treated (approximately 30%) .1-[ADDRESS_918462] health professionals.16 A growing body of 
research suggests that information and communication technology (ICT), such as smart phones, can lead to 
more out -of-office health -related behavior change than standard paper methods (e.g., diaries or self -help 
books) through increased convenience, interactivity , and adherence.19-26 Such interventions may be especially 
attractive to youth because they contribute to an increased sense of autonomy .27,28 
The current proposal is part of a larger research program to develop clinically informed methods for 
increasing access to evidence- based treatment  for childhood anxiety disorders. This pro gram recently 
developed a smart phone application, Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach , based on cognitive- behavioral treatment for 
anxiety disorders (i.e., exposure- based therapy)29,30 that can be used as 1) a stand -alone treatment requiring 
minimal provider  contact ; and 2) an augmentation of face- to-face treatment that increases clinician fidelity and 
patient adherence to evidence- based treatment . The design of Anxiety Coach is based on evidence and 
theory23 suggesting that ICTs are well-suited for encouraging behavior change through 1) scheduled reminders 
to engage in therapeutic exercises ,31 2) point of performance support ,32 3) individually tailored information,21,33, 
19 4) real -time symptom assessment ,34 and 5) readily accessible asynchronous communication.[ADDRESS_918463] will:  
Aim 1:   Adapt Anxiety Coach for use with a health care provider.  During Phase I, a  web-based portal that  
allow s providers to monitor  symptoms and adherence, provide reminders to complete therapeutic exercises, 
and communicate asynchronously with patients will be developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_60528] 15 patients. In addition, 
community therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678851] a survey of current practices conducted under 
IRB 14-002608  for participation in Phase II.  
Aim 2:  Assess feasibility , safety, acceptance, and impact on behavior and symptoms of Anxiety Coach.   
During Phase II , [ADDRESS_918464] : 1) Reviewing the acceptability of Anxiety Coach and integrating into their practice as desired (n= 30  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]); 2) Treating children with anxiety disorders with treatment as usual or Anxiety Coach  with face- to-
face therapy,  (N = 30 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_41259] 30 patients);  or 3) Treating children with anxiety disorders with treatment 
as usual or Anxiety Coach with minimal contact  (N = 30 patients) . 
 
Note: The current modification covers the initiation of Trial 2  and Trial 3. T rial 1 has been approved and 
enrollment as begun.   
Aim 3 :  Develop a protocol for implementing Anxiety Coach.  During Phase III, the feasibility data, along 
with input from patients and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678852], will be analyzed and used to write a

Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918465] will deliver  a protocol detailing  the use of an innovative smart phone 
technology, Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach, to improve access to effective care for childhood anxiety disorders 
through 1) providing interventions outside traditional mental health settings with minimal provider contact; and 
2) disseminating exposure- based CBT to community practitioners. These results will be used to pursue R01 
funding to conduct randomized controlled trials powered to ev aluate the symptom improvement and cost -
efficiency of using Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach in these settings . By [CONTACT_678971], Anxiety Coach has the potential to improve the outcomes for a large number of children suffering 
from anxiety disorders.  
  
 
RESEARCH STRATEGY  
 
Overview.  This proposal satisfies the purpose of PAR-12-279 “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_678853] (R34) ,” which seeks to encourage intervention development and service delivery research.  
 
A. SIGNIFICANCE  
To increase access to evidence- based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  (CBT ) for childhood anxiety disorders , 
the current proposal will enhance a recently developed smart phone application, Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach , 
and examine its feasibility for providing treatment to patients with limited access to traditional mental health 
services and for disseminating therapeutic strategies to professionals.  
Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in childhood with prevalence rates as  
high as 15% , however they are the least likely to be treated (approximately 30%).
1-[ADDRESS_918466] an 
adequate number of providers to address the populations’ psychiatric needs.[ADDRESS_918467] with health professionals.16  
Information and communication technologies (IC T; i.e., web - and smartphone- based applications) have the 
potential to more efficiently provide health care in a variety of areas including anxiety and depression,[ADDRESS_918468] -efficient means to not only disseminate evidence-
based practice to clinicians, but to provide high quality care directly to patients. For such programs to be effecti ve they need to provide evidence- based treatment strategies (i.e.,
 CBT) via a medium based on 
evidence regarding the promotion of health behavior change through ICT.35,36  
 
B. INNOVATION  
 
B.1. Dissemination Through Information and Communication Technology (ICT) . Mayo Clinic Anxiety 
Coach provides  the content depth of  web-based programs with the point -of-performance tailored messaging 
possible with a mobile device to affect behavior change outside of the presence of a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  
 Health and behavior change programs administered via ICT, similar to Anxiety Coach,  have a number of 
features that can improve treatment adherence and outcome including: 1) scheduled reminders to engage in therapeutic exercises ,
31 2) point of performance support ,32  3) individually tailored information,19,21,33 4) real -
time symptom assessment ,34 5) readily accessible asynchronous communication,33 and 6) attractive ness  to

Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918469] been evaluated scienti fically are applicable to child anxiety disorders.  
 Smartphones present a unique opportunity to reach a large portion of the population including underserved 
groups . As of September 2012, 59% for those ages 30 to 49, the age range for parents in this proposal , owned 
a smartphone. In underserved populations, rates are 35% for low income households, 29% for rural areas, and 
are higher  for minorities than Caucasians.47 The majority of the population will likely own sma rtphones in the 
near future as 85% currently own  a cell phone and the percentage of  smartphones versus traditional cell 
phones is rising, 55% in June 2012 up from 30% in October of 2010.[ADDRESS_918470]  that smartphones 
will be a convenient medium for reaching individuals of all ethnicities, incomes, and regions.  
 
B.2. Evidence- Based Treatment for Childhood Anxiety Disorders.   Anxiety Coach maximizes the likelihood 
of disseminating CBT to practitioners by [CONTACT_678972] (e.g., fear hierarchies , automated 
messaging) that accentuates  the importance of  exposure.  
 The treatment content provided by [CONTACT_678973]. Although a wealth of data supports the efficacy  of CBT for 
childhood anxiety disorders,30,49-[ADDRESS_918471] been largely 
unsuccessful .18,52-54 One possible factor for the lack of differentiation with usual care may be the infrequent use 
of exposure in effectiven ess trials (e.g., 50 %-60% of patients compared to upwards of 90% in efficacy  
trials).18,30 Exposure is frequently described as the active ingredient in  CBT29,55-62 and, consistent with basic 
research on the effects of approach and avoidance on children’ s acquisition  of fear beliefs,63 is hypothesized to 
allow successful emotional reprocessing of feared stimuli64 and modification of harm expectancies.65 The 
importance of exposure is supported by a review of meta -analyses of adult  anxiety treatment  finding strong 
support for exposures , but variable additional benefit from cognitive techniques66 and outcome studies with 
children finding improvement only after the initiation of exposure.67,68 Other possible contributions to the 
difference between effectiveness and efficacy studies  include poorer retention, shorter treatment duration,  and 
lack of protocol flexibility to address comorbidity.18 Taken together these  results  suggests that dissemination 
may be more successful by [CONTACT_678974] ( e.g., community therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s report using in vivo  
exposure approximately a third of time, less often than cognitive and non- evidence- based interventions14,15), 
while preserving flexibility to individually tailor treatment. In fact, recent protocols that encourage exposure 
early in treatment through the use of decision rules  have been more effective than manuals  following a more 
prescriptive session- by-session format.69,[ADDRESS_918472] 
that protocols specify ing a primary active treatment ingredient and allowing  the clinician to individually tailor 
treatment administration may lead to more effective community care than previous  approaches.   
 
B.3. Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach.  Current ly Anxiety Coach delivers individually tailored exposure- based CBT 
with automated messaging. The proposed study will allow patients to use Anxiety Coach with a provider by 
[CONTACT_678975] (e.g., text messaging) through a web- based portal and generate 
data supporting the application’s feasibility, safety, and estimated impact.  
 Anxiety Coach is an application to deliver  CBT for anxiety disorders via iOS (the operating system for the 
iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) that combines the latest research on ICT and CBT dissemination. The content 
consists of three modules: Assessment, Psychoeducation, and Treatment. The assessment module measures  
the frequency of  anxiety symp toms corresponding to the DSM  criteria with a self-report Likert -type scale. The 
application minimizes patient burden by [CONTACT_678976]’s responses on a 14-
item screener to determine the number of  follow -up questions (maximum 21) needed to characterize the 
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- 000288  Page 5  patient’s symptoms . The results of the evaluation are presented graphically along with text describing the 
results and providing tailored recommendations. Patients can track their progress over time by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]- taking the 
assessment and by [CONTACT_678977]. The second module contains 
psychoeducational material on the use of Anxiety Coach, the cognitive- behavioral conceptualization of anxiety, 
descriptions of each anxiety disorder, explanations of cognitive behavioral therapy, and guidance for accessing other forms of treatment. The information for each category is easily accessible through 4 to 8 brief segments 
that typi[INVESTIGATOR_678854] 1  to 2 screens (less than 400 words).  
 The central component of the application is the treatment module that guides patients with the help of a 
parent through the use of exposure therapy. Pati ents and parents can select from approximately 100 premade 
fear hierarchies that outline graduated exposure exercises for a wide variety of anxiety symptoms (social situations, panic attacks, separation from loved ones, general worry, obsessions and compul sions, trauma, and 
specific fears). Patients and parents can also enter text for additional items or use a 4- step wizard to create a 
unique fear hierarchy. Once a hierarchy is established, Anxiety Coach  guides the patients and parents through 
the completion of exposure in real -world situations. This process includes assessing the likelihood and severity 
of negative outcomes, beginning an exposure ( in vivo , imaginal, or interoceptive), tracking anxiety graphically 
during the exposure, receiving prompts to continue until the anxiety has decreased, and evaluating the 
outcome of the exposure. Patients and parents can record their success by [CONTACT_678978] o f completion, the 
duration of the exposure, and anxiety ratings at the beginning and end. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678855].  
 Anxiety Coach has four features that differentiate it from other applications: 1) coverage of the full range of 
anxiety disorders; 2) emphasis on exposure, the evidence- based active ingredient of treatment; 
3) individualization to the patient’s symptoms; and 4) a library of clinical -based exposur e hierarchies. A search 
of the A pp store, the Internet, library databases, and a list compi[INVESTIGATOR_483256] a survey by [CONTACT_678979]. In addition, to our knowledg e 
no smartphone application has a web- based portal for a clinician to track an individual’s engagement in, or 
progress with, treatment. Other applications provide either instruction in relaxation or other non -evidence 
based interventions, emphasize cogniti ve restructuring rather than exposure, cannot be individualized, focus 
on a single disorder , or do not provide a library of pre- existing hierarchies. Anxiety Coach is designed to be 
applicable to individuals across the age range and includes [ADDRESS_918473] interventions ,71 the user interface design is based 
on principles associated with retaining users : appealing colors and screen layouts; intuitive, concise navigation 
and functionality to minimize user burden; and features encouraging interactivity, such as self -tests and self -
monitoring.23,[ADDRESS_918474] functions found to increase effectiveness,  such as individually 
tailored content and point of performance feedback.21,33 Likewise, we will recruit participants (i.e., therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678856]) that are likely to adhere to the study protocol 
because they find the content personally relevant.[ADDRESS_918475] for health 
behavior change including quantifying the appropriate dose and the degree of professional assistance needed 
to benefit from Anxiety Coach, measuring behavior change (i.e., exposure) hypothesized to lead to symptom 
improvement, and focusing on safety, data security, and tolerability.23,35 
 
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918476] will provide a protocol detailing the use of Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach to 1) promote and 
monitor provider fidelity to evidence- based practices, and 2) allow patients to access effective care  outside 
traditional brick and mortar  mental health settings. By [CONTACT_678980], Anxiety 
Coach has the potential to improve outcomes for a large number of children suffering from anxiety disorders.  
 
C. APPROACH  
 
C.1. Overview. In this proposal we will augment Anxiety Coach with functions that facilitate patient -provider 
communications and feedback. We will then do a small -scale deployment of the enhanced software as a tool to 
a) facilitate use of evidence- based practices within face -to-face therapeutic encounte rs, and b) provide CBT to 
patients with infrequent face- to-face contact, carefully examining its acceptability, ease of use, and need for 
contact.  Findings from this deployment will be used to develop a protocol for implementing and testing within a 
future  randomized controlled trial . During Phase I  we will a) develop a web-based portal for practitioners to 
monitor  symptoms and adherence, provide reminders to complete therapeutic exercises, and communicate 
asynchronously with patients; b) pi[INVESTIGATOR_678857] h with 15 patients; and c) recruit therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678858] a survey  conducted under IRB 14- [ADDRESS_918477] : 1) Reviewing the acceptability of 
Anxiety Coach and integrating into their practice as desired (n= 30 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]); 2) Treat ing children with anxiety 
disorders (with the support from study personnel) using treatment as usual  (TAU) or Anxiety Coach  with face-
to-face therapy  (FTF-AC); or 3) T reating children w ith anxiety disorders (with the support from study personnel) 
using TAU or Anxiety Coach with minimal contact  (MC-AC). During Phase III the feasibility data will be 
analyzed and used to write a protocol for training therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678859]- to-face 
therapy and provide treatment with minimal contact.  
 
Note: The current modification covers the initiation of Trial [ADDRESS_918478] anxiety during  exposure exercises. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678860] a secure webpage the patient’s 
symptoms, the fear hierarchy items targeted for exposure, the patient’s anxiety ratings during the exposure, 
and number of exposures completed. This information all owed the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678861]’s adherence 
to treatment recommendations as well as symptom response without a face- to-face meeting. The test version 
was pi[INVESTIGATOR_60528] 4 child- parent dyads seeking treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, specific  phobia, and 
obsessive compulsive disorder (x2) through the Mayo Clinic Pediatric Anxiety Disorder Clinic . All families rated 
the application as “very  helpful” and “very easy to use” (the top rating on a four -point scale).  The families 
accessed the program  on 56% of days, suggesting that intervention was moderately integrated into the families 
routine compared to once or twice weekly homework
[ADDRESS_918479], suggesting that increased functionality would increase the frequency of use.  
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918480] format.75-77 In a retrospective study75 and a prospective 
study77 characterizing the delivery of treatment components with anxious youth in our clinic (Ns of 43 and 28 
respectively), treatment was generally shorter (8 to 9 vs. 14 to 16 sessions) and included exposures earlier (3rd 
or 4th vs. 10th session) than in traditional manualized interventions in efficacy and effectiveness studies. 
Exposure begun earlier resulted in more patients receiving exposure than in effectiveness studies (100% vs. 
59%) and greater use of exposure was associate d with 
more improvement in functioning ( r = .32). Both studies 
found large pre to post effect sizes among treatment 
completers for parent -reported symptoms (1.47 and 
1.82) and functioning (1.72 and 1.24). A third study 
suggests that the exposure- focused approach prepares 
families to maintain improvement after the termination 
of direct therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220887]. In this uncontrolled 
examination,  15 youth  completed a 5- day intensive 
treatment for OCD. Baseline  scores on the Children’s 
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsiv e Scale (CY -BOCS)  
in the severe range ( m = 28.3, s.d. = 5.0) decreased to 
a moderate level ( m = 16.3, s.d.  = 6.4) immediately 
following the intensive week  and continued to decline to 
the mild range ( m = 11.8, s.d.  = 7.5) over the next four  
months without direct therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220887].  
 
C.2.c . Application Development. Following the development of the test version and treatment content  Drs. 
Whiteside, Abramowitz, and Duncan received a CoDE Fund (Connect, Design, Enable) Grant from the Mayo 
Clinic Center for Innovation in 2010 to develop the current version of Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach described 
above (Section B.3). The goal was to design an application that had comprehensive content to be a stand -
alone intervention; flexibility and responsiveness to be individually tailored; an intuitive interface to be used 
independently; a simple and interactive design to retain users; and functionality to interact with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. 
Over a [ADDRESS_918481]. The resulting beta version was submitted to a focus group of 
individuals from varied backgrounds with limited knowledge of mental health treatment. Through an iterative 
process of collecting feedback from the initial focus group and additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], experts in systems and procedures, and laypersons the team simplified and r efined the content and design.  
 Anxiety Coach was then pi[INVESTIGATOR_678862]: a 14 -year-old girl presenting for a week -long intensive 
treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia, separation anxiety disorder,  GAD , and OCD; and a 12- year-old 
girl, using Anxiety Coach  as an adjunct to stalled progress in individual CBT for OCD. Both patients used the 
application to complete exposures approximately twice per week, and described it  as helpful and engaging. 
The first patient’s symptoms as measured by  [CONTACT_6270]- and mother -report on the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale, 
remained stable during baseline prior to t reatment, improved during the [ADDRESS_918482] (Figure 1). The second patient experienced 
minimal symptom improvement over 2- months (CY -BOCS 21 to 18). This pi[INVESTIGATOR_678863], but reiterated the importance a mechanism for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s to monitor and communicate with the 
patient. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_678864] [ADDRESS_918483] downloaded

of the application prior to and during Phase I of the S tudy.  
 
C.2.d. Summary and Justification for Funding. To build on the initial development and pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], f unding 
is necessary to create the web- based portal; and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and impact of 
Anxiety Coach to disseminate evidence- based CBT and provide a minimal contact [CONTACT_52886]. Funding is 
needed to create and refine the clinical content and feedback components of the web- portal as well as to 
develop the software that supports the portal. Funding is als o needed to support the recruitment of community 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133224], conduct assessment and treatment, analyze data from the feasibility study, prepare 
scientific reports, and to develop the procedures and protocols for testing Anxiety Coach within an RCT.  
 Each of the investigators and consultants has considerable experience that support the successful 
completion of the proposed project: (1) Dr . Whiteside has extensive experience in exposure- based CBT for 
childhood anxiety disorders, as well as the development and evaluation of treatments; (2) [CONTACT_679017] 
has expertise in qualitative and quantitative assessment, (3 ) [CONTACT_679018] is an internationally known anxiety 
disorder researcher with exper tise in treatment evaluation; (4 ) [CONTACT_41942] has created multiple healthcare -
related applications for the iOS platform; (5) [CONTACT_679019] is an internationally recognized expert and leading 
figure in the development and evaluation of treatments for childhood anxiety disorders; ( 6) [CONTACT_679020] is a 
leading authority on the development of ICT -based psychological interventions; and (7) the Principal 
Investigator’s (PI’s) site is an internationally recognized medical center with extensive resources including 
biostatistician services, a center for the development of medical information technology, and  an extensive 
network of community mental health providers contracted through an affiliated insurance plan.  
 
C.3. Study Design 
 
C.3.a. Study Phase I: Web Portal Design, Use &  Procedures Manual Development, Open Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], and 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678865]: (14  months) . Study Phase [ADDRESS_918484] four months Drs. Whiteside and Abramowitz 
will develop the content of a web- based portal that enables a health care provider to asynchronously monitor 
and communicate with patients using Anxiety Coach. Information from the patient ’s device (e.g., symptom 
ratings, target and duration of completed exposures) will be automatically uploaded to the web- based portal, 
which the provider accesses from a computer. The portal will be a webpage through which the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678866] a ) whether the patient is using the application, b) the patient’s current symptom level , and c) 
communicate with the patient electronically. The homepage will display all of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s patients actively 
using Anxiety Coach. Each name [CONTACT_258503] [CONTACT_102]’s recent use of Anxiety Coach including the 
number of exposures completed over the past week, change in symptom ratings, and the presence of any messages or activities (i.e., reassessment) that need attention. From the home page the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678867] a 
patient from the list to access more detailed information including: a) frequency and duration of time spent by 
[CONTACT_678981]; b) logs of completed exposures including item, anxiety ratings, duration, and 
outcome; c) graphics  of daily symptom ratings; d) the fear -hierarchy with mastered items; e) summaries of 
assessments; and d) a log of communication with the patient. The provider will be able to compose and send messages to the patient; enable automated reminders and messages; generate progress notes; or schedule 
interactions  (e.g., phone call, videophone, in person meeting). In addition, the web- based portal will track the 
amount of time therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678868] a patient’s case outside of therapy sessions. The patient’s  interfac e 
through the Anxiety Coach application will be enhanced with embedded instructional videos, increased child 
friendly features (e.g., interactive educational materials, graphics for the To Do List),  capability to message and 
schedule with the provider, and automated reminders. The software to implement these features in a secure 
fashion will be completed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Duncan over the first eight months. The system will employ industry -standard 
security practices to ensure the protection of sensitive data and adher e closely to applicable health technology 
standards including HIPAA and preliminary guidance from the FDA on mobile medical software.

Whiteside 13- 000288  Page 9  C.3.a.2. Development of a Use and Procedures Manual (UPM). During the first [ADDRESS_918485]. Abramowitz will develop a Use and Procedures Manual (UPM) to guide the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678869]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678870]: a) a treatment rationale and 
background; b) a curri culum for using the Anxiety Coach to introduce patients to the application and exposure-
based CBT; c) minimum standards for the frequency that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678871], d) 
thresholds for determining when patients are not adhering to treatment or progressing adequately; e) 
instructions for intervention when patients fail to meet thresholds; f) procedures for assessing and responding 
to crises, comorbidity, and safety issues; and g) decisions trees for initiating additional face -to-face contact. 
The section for the study personnel  that support the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678872]: a) a curriculum for training 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678873], exposure -based CBT, and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678874]; b) minimum standards for the 
frequency that support personnel monitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678875]; and c) instructions for 
how to intervene when therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678876]. The above guidelines for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678877] w ith appropriate modifications for FTF- AC 
versus MC -AC. In addition, a comparable set of instructions to orient therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678878]. The protocol  will be reviewed by [CONTACT_678982] s 
[CONTACT_679021] as an expert in child anxiety disorder s treatment research and [CONTACT_679022] 
as an expert on the ICT delivery of psychological  treatment s.
  
 
C.3.a.3. Open Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238].  During months [ADDRESS_918486]. Whiteside will provide support to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Staff from Mayo Clinic 
HealthCare Policy & Research under the supervision of Drs. Vickers Douglas will conduct qualitative interviews 
with patients, parents, and clinicians to elicit information regarding the design, content, usability, and 
satisfaction with FTC -AC, MC -AC, and the UPM. Drs. Whiteside, and Duncan with consultation from [CONTACT_679023] will review data regarding symptom change, exposure use, and use of Anxiety Coach  to examine 
whether patients made acceptable improvement (defined as equal or greater to outcomes found previously in our clinic and in published trials) and qualitative data regarding patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678879].  
 
C.3.a.4. Recruitment of Community Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Simultaneously to the steps outlined in C.3.a.[ADDRESS_918487] s for participation in Phase II. 
The survey will be administered through the Mayo Clinic Survey Research Center and will be sent to outpatient 
mental health therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] . This panel includes  1111 mental health providers ( 25% clinical social workers, 17% 
psychiatrists, 16% master’s professional counselors, 13% Ph.D. psychologist s, 10% marriage and family 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], 7% PsyD psychologists, and 5% nurse practitioners) practic ing in a variety of settings ( 54% regional 
clinics, 22% private or group practice, and 14% in a major medical center). The practi tioners ar e in 45 counties 
across southeaster n Minnesota, northern Iowa, and western Wisconsin with 45 % in counties, excluding major 
metropolitan areas , designated by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as Mental Health Care 
Health Professional Shortage Areas.
78 The survey will inquire about theoretical orientation, number of children 
with anxiety disorders seen, use of a variety of ther apeutic s trategies including exposure, and beliefs about 
exposure. The survey will be sent electronically. Non- responders will be sent a second e mail.  This procedure 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_678880] s in a 30 to 40% response rate. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s in underserved counties (excluding the major urban 
centers)  that report treating children with anxiety disorders, openness to CBT, and infrequent use of exposure 
will be recruited for participation in Phase II. In addition, data will be used to characterize the frequency with 
which evidence- based therapy is provided within the community .  
 
In response to concerns expressed by [CONTACT_678983],  the recruitment plan was 
amended to include contact[CONTACT_678984][INVESTIGATOR_678881]. This plan was approved under a separate IRB proposal (IRB # 14 -

send an email invitation to all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678882] (e.g., psychology and social work), 2) Re -send an email  invitation to all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678883], 3) Contact [CONTACT_678985][INVESTIGATOR_678884].  Based on previous lists we anticipate that we will send 
invitations t o approximately 8,000 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  
 In response to the IRB’s decision that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678885] 2 and 3 will be engaged in research activity, 
participation in Trials 2 and 3 will be limited to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678886] ([COMPANY_002]ster and Health System) 
and external organizations that have an IRB and with which we complete a reliance agreement.  Recruitment of 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678886] (Mayo Clinic will be used to refer to R ochester and Health System ) will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_5984] (PI, study coordinator, intervention specialists) directly through emails and phone 
calls (scripts included in this modification).  In addition, study staff will provide the recruitment scrip ts to division 
leaders and supervisors to ensure that recruitment and participation in the study is consistent with clinical programming. Finally, the study staff will provide recruitment materials to members of the Convergence Child 
Specialty Council to provide interested clinicians with familiar contact [CONTACT_678986]. All efforts to recruit 
clinicians will emphasize the voluntary nature of the study and that declining to participate will have no effect 
on their employment or care through Mayo Clinic. Our study staff will directly contact [CONTACT_678987]. Only 
institutions that have at least [ADDRESS_918489] trial, 
i.e., acceptability study.  
 
 
C.3.b. Phase II: Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678887] (18 months).  The second phase of this proposal will address Aim 2 of 
assessing the feasibility, safety, acceptance, and impac t of Anxiety Coach through three trials.  
 
Note: The current modification covers the initiation of Trial 2 and Trial 3. Trial 1 has been approved and 
enrollment as begun.  
  Trial 1.  In Trial 1 (Acceptability) we will gather acceptability and usability data from up to [ADDRESS_918490] patient confidentiality , the system will generate 
numerical identifiers  (e.g. Patient #1) and  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678888], rather than 
full names and birthdates. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678889]. In addition, 
data automatically recorded through any use of the application will be analyzed.  
 Trial 2.  In Trial 2 (Increasing Exposure Us e) 30 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678890] t reat 30 children with 
anxiety disorders with treatment as usual or FTF- AC. (If necessary due to limited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599144], 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678891] a second patient with FTF -AC).Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133224]/parents will be 
consented. Data collection will include questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_11437], patients, and parents before 
and after treatment, as well as audio recordings of sessions, and data automatically saved by [CONTACT_99023].  
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- 000288  Page 11   Trial 3.  In Trial 3 (Increasing Access) children with anxiety disorders will be randomize to receive with MC-
AC delivered by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_678892] (study staff) or treatment as usual in the 
community or within Mayo Clinic, just not with their current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] . Data collection will include questionnaires 
completed by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_11437], patients, and parents before and after treatment, as well as data automatically saved 
by [CONTACT_99023]. Following the study all patients will be offered treatment within the Pediatric Anxiety 
Disorders Clinic. Patients in the community treatment group will also receive the Anxiety Coach application.  
 
C.3.c. Phase III: Revision Stage (4 months).  During the final [ADDRESS_918491] care and disseminate evidence- based treatment.  
 
C.4. Participant Availability  and Recruitment.  The outpatient mental  health therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678893] 2 will be 
recruited  and will subsequently recruit their own patients into the study. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678894]. Before recruiting patients, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678895]. Patients will be recruited by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_678896]. 
Patients will be screened and consented by [CONTACT_464]. Patients and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678897] ($100 total) and will receive an iPod Touch  that 
they can keep . Partnering institutions in the minimal contact [CONTACT_678988]- billable time 
spent on the Anxiety Coach  portal at a rate of $146.[ADDRESS_918492] 
largely been recruited under the initially approved IRB protocol. Additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678898].  
 
C.4.a. Inclusion Criteria.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] : 1) Treat child anxiety patients; 2 ) Current license as a mental health

of [CONTACT_679024] and evaluator); 2) A parent or other p rimary care giver available to participate with the child in 
all assessment and treatment acti vities ; and 3) English speaking.  
 
C.4.b. Exclusion Criteria.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] : 1) History of investigation or disciplinary action (based on review of 
institutional records) , Trials 2 and 3 only ; and 2) Opposition to CBT per survey responses. Patients : 1) History

Patients and their prescribers  will be encourag ed to refrain from changing psychotropic medications or 
dosages during the study without consulting the study staff ( Human Subjects); changes will be recorded and 
analyzed.  
 
C.5. Interventions. Each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678899] s with TAU  or FTF-AC. The 
general intervention structure is consistent across treatments to avoid confounding variations.  
 C.5.a. General Intervention Structure.  In Trial 2, p rior to each patient beginning treatment an intervention 
specialist  will conduct a [ADDRESS_918493] an additional phone call with the study coordinator to receive assistance accessing the 
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918494] will provide 6 to 12 treatment contacts over the 12 -week period. 
These parameters are based on the median and modal number of sessions attended by [CONTACT_678991]  (6)77 and the number of sessions in the seminal trial of childhood anxiety treatment (12).[ADDRESS_918495]’s clinical judgment. These requirements are to ensure that patients receive a sufficient treatment dose 
to compare therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678900]. In each condition of Trial [ADDRESS_918496]  will: 1) 
Review each patient weekly; 2) respond to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678901] w ithin 24 hours; and 3) contact [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_678902] . In Trial [ADDRESS_918497] over with 
question about how to use Anxiety Coach for a six -month period following the initial training.  
 
C.5.b. Treatment as Usual (TAU).  In the  TAU condition (Trial 2) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678903]. Previous research suggest that TAU will include supportive therapy, 
relaxation, and cognitive restructuring.[ADDRESS_918498]’s office, with flexi bility to leave the office (e.g., for exposure). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678904] (e.g., phone calls), as long as this medium is not the primary 
mode of treatment. In preparation for TAU the project director will train therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] i n: 1) teaching patients and 
caregivers to record daily symptoms with the iPod Touch; 2) audio recording sessions; 3) the role of the project director to track progress and provide support; and 4) the guidelines regarding the structure of sessions.  
 
C.5.c . Face- to-face Treatment Using Anxiety Coach (FTF -AC). In this condition therapi[INVESTIGATOR_208991] [ADDRESS_918499] in using Anxiety Coach within therapy including: 1) a 
brief overview of the cognitive behavioral model and demonstration of the psychoeducation component of the application; 2) demonstration of the assessment aspects of the application and instructions on how to direct 
patients to take the self -test and provide daily ratings; 3) introduction on how to construct a fear hierarchy using 
Anxiety Coach; 4) demonstration of how t o conduct exposure exercises with cognitive restructuring using 
Anxiety Coach; 5) introduction to use of the web- based portal to monitor patient use of the application, 6) 
discussion of the procedures for the project director to monitor use of the applicat ion and how to contact [CONTACT_678992]; and 7) the guidelines regarding the structure of sessions.  
 
C.5.d . Minimal Contact [CONTACT_678993] (MC-AC).  
In this condition , the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678905] a [ADDRESS_918500] is expected to review the patient’s progress via the web-based portal and communicate with the patient electronically at least once per week for a total of at least [ADDRESS_918501] director will train therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (all study 
staff) on using Anxiety Coach as in the FTF -AC training ( C.5.c ) with the exception of 7) the guidelines 
regardin g the structure of contacts  (rather than sessions).  
 
C.5.e. Treatment as usual (TAU) . The control condition in Trial [ADDRESS_918502]. Specifically, the TAU  vs. FTF -AC 
comparison  provides an estimate of the feasibility and palatability of Anxiety Coach  to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], a measure 
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- 000288  Page 13  of the extent to which the application facilitates therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ use of exposure -based methods, the usefulness of 
Anxiety Coach for disseminating evidence- based CBT methods to community therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and its value for 
facilitating treatment adherence among patients with anxiety disorders.  Randomizing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]/patients to one 
of two  conditions removes the potential for bias to affect recruitment, keeps the evaluators blind to 
experimental condition, removes concerns with order effects, and allows for the more patients to be treated 
simultaneously thus decreasing the length of the study. The MC-AC vs. TAU  comparison provides an 
estimate of the feasibility as well as the impact on acceptability and outcome of using Anxiety Coach with 
limited direct therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678906] a method for extending treatment outside of the brick and mortar mental 
health settings. To increase the real -world generalizability of the study, the study will not pay for therapy, but 
patients in all conditions will be reimbursed for participation in assessments and will be allowed to keep the 
iPod Touch.  
 
C.6.b . Inclusion of Treatment as Usual . The inclusion of TAU provides a more stringent and naturalistic test 
of the relative feasibility and benefits of Anxiety Coach than use of no- treatment or non- specific active placebo. 
In addition, a TAU control group does not require training of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. On the other hand, although exposure 
is rarely used in community practice,[ADDRESS_918503] in participating in the 
study will be assessed through phone screening completed by [CONTACT_3476]. Information regarding licensure 
status, frequency of treating children with anxiety disorders, and openness  to pi[INVESTIGATOR_28882] a smartphone -based 
CBT aide will be confirmed by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ institution. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678907]/exclusion criteria will be 
mailed a consent form.  
 
C.7.c. Patient Telephone Screening. For Trials 2 and 3, a  multi -gate screening procedure will be used to 
recruit patients . Interested patients evaluated as part of clinical practice by [CONTACT_678994][INVESTIGATOR_678908], instructions, two copi[INVESTIGATOR_243305]/assent documents, parent - and child- report forms , 
and instructions to contact [CONTACT_678995] -consent screening. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678909]. During the screening call, i nformation  regarding the 
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- 000288  Page 14  patient’s symptoms, previous treatment  and diagnoses, and willingness to be assigned to one of three 
treatment conditions will be gathered.  The number of callers deemed ineligible and reasons for ineligibility will 
be recorded in the Screening Log.  If patient is likely to be eligible, a consent  and evaluation videophone visit 
will be scheduled. This visit should occur within 1 week (+/ - 1 week) from the initial therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678910].  
 
C.7.d . Consent and Evaluation. For Trials 2 and 3 t he videophone consent and evaluation visit  should be 
completed within 1 week (+/ - 1 week) from the initial therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678911]: 1) 
Consent  and 2) Evaluation. During the Consent phase, the consent/assent documents will be reviewed and all 
parties will be given adequate opportunity to ask questions. Specific areas of the consent/assent will be re-
reviewed if deficits in understanding are identified. If consent/assent is signed, completion of the Evaluation 
phase of the visit will commence. If signed consent/assent is not received, the patient will not be enrolled and 
the information will not be used. Patient eligibility will be formally determined during the Evaluation phase by [CONTACT_678996]. Vickers  Douglas . At this time 
the child and parent will complete paper and pencil measures as well as interviewer administered structured 
diagnostic interviews. T he feasibility of conducting assessments via videophone has been demonstrated in a 
recently  completed multi- site study of an intensive treatment with [ADDRESS_918504]. Whiteside. In this study 100% of the OCD diagnoses made at the initial evaluation via videophone were 
confirmed with face-to-face assessments completed after  a one -month no -treatment period. Preliminary data 
suggest that 67% did not meet criteria for OCD after the evaluation and scores on interview administered 
continuous measures decreased by 65% suggesting that videophone assessments are sensitive to treatment. 
Access to ICT did not appear to harm recruitment as 100% of the families who expressed interest in 
participation already had access to the Internet prior to study enrollment.  At the end of the videophone 
evaluation, caregivers  will be instructed to return signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_127051]/assent  forms  and completed parent - 
and child- report forms in the postage- paid envelope to study staff as soon as possible.  Patients will not be 
considered enrolled in the study until the signed consent/assent documents have been received and signed by 
[CONTACT_464]. Patients for whom consent/assent is not returned will be considered screen failures, and data 
collected prior to receiving consent will not  be included in  any research- related activities.   
 
If therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678893] [ADDRESS_918505] will then o ffer participation to the next patient they see likely to qualify. (If needed, 
the second patient treated by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678912]-AC condition. ) This 
format clearly differentiates the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ participation in the study from the patients’ participation.  To limit 
bias in enrollment, neither pati ents nor the independent evaluators will be aware of therapeutic condition at the 
time of enrollment . Treatment in each condition can  begin within [ADDRESS_918506] will not receive any instruction regarding the content of treatment. In all three 
conditions across the two trials the intervention specialists or the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_678913]’ 
compliance with guidelines. The  intervention specialis ts have highly developed therapeutic skills, at least five 
years ’ experience providing CBT to children with anxiety disorders  and their families, extensive one- on-one 
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918507]’s use of the study interventions or a patient’s  progress, clinical deterioration, or 
development of new symptoms.  
 
C.7.g. Assessment Timeline.  Patient participants will receive two assessments conducted via videophone by 
a trained independent evaluator blind to condition under the supervision of [CONTACT_679017].  The initial 
assessment will b e conducted at baseline (Time 1) when the patient’s eligibility is determined. The patient will 
begin treatment within one to two weeks. The patient’s response to treatment will be assessed 12 weeks  (+/- 2 
weeks)  after the initial treatment session  (Time 2). T he evaluations will be comprehensive in nature (e.g., 
diagnostic interview, clinician ratings, par ent- and self -reports ). Accommodations will be made for families 
without electronic access, such as videophone assessments in the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s office. Beginning at the baseline assessment and continuing throughout  the study, patients will rate their daily s ymptoms  with an iPod Touch.  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678893] [ADDRESS_918508] will be asked to complete the survey material, usability measure, 
and a questionnaire about their actual use of Anxiety Coach since the training.  
 
C.7.h . Additional Treatment. During Trials 2 and 3 participants will be asked to refrain from participating in 
additional treatment during the study (i.e. other therapy, initiating or changing medications). Following the post -
treatment evaluation patients can continue with their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678914]. Patients in the TAU 
condition will be provided Anxiety Coach  and treatment recommendations after the post -treatment evaluation. 
Given that many children are treated with medication before being referred for therapy , restricting participation 
to medication- free patients would interfere with enrollment . Medication changes during the study will be 
recorded and analyzed.  
 C.8. Procedural Considerations.  
 C.8.a . Age Range.  A relatively broad age range will be included to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing Anxiety 
Coach with children at different developmental levels. Although the proposed agent of change ( cognitive 
change through exposure) is  theoretically consistent across the age range, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678915] a developmentally sensitive manner , e.g. allowing more independence with 
adolescent s, less discussion of cognitions with children. The current proposal focuses on youth as this 
population is at particularly high risk of not receiving effective treatment, has an high level of familiarity with 
ICT, and has been found to be particularly motivated by [CONTACT_678997].
4,27,28 
 
C.8.b . Inclusion of Patients with Comorbid Disorders.  Children with multiple anxiety disorders or additional 
diagnosis (i.e., well- managed ADHD) will be included except  disorders that present a more severe group 
requiring treatment  that might interfere with CBT (e.g., Major Depression, Oppositional Defiant Disorder).  
 
C.8.c. Recruitment. The current recruitment strategy is intended to approximate the conditions under which 
Anxiety Coach would have the most impact, i.e. areas where psychiatric needs exceed mental health providers  
with specialization in CBT for childhood anxi ety disorders. To maximize external validity the experimental 
treatment will be implemented by [CONTACT_296805][INVESTIGATOR_678916] a large geographical area, particularly 
areas with a mental health shortage designation, and treatment will be paid for throu gh traditional clinical 
mechani sms.[ADDRESS_918509] treatment where it 
would be more difficult to address problems with safety, usability, or lack of progress. We anticipate that the 
data from the proposed study will prepare for future projects extending services to those outside the system by: 
a) improving the application; b) documenting the utility of Anxiety C oach; and c) creating a web -based portal 
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918510] (face -to-face or via the web- portal depending on the condition) once per week for [ADDRESS_918511], parent and child report will be completed online via the Survey Research Centers electronic survey 
tools (or by [CONTACT_678998]).  
 
C.9.a. Clinician- Administered Measures :  Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM -IV-Child Version  
Child an d Parent Interview Schedules (ADIS -IV-C/P).79 The ADIS -IV-C/P are structured interviews to assess 
the child’s symptoms. Diagnoses reflect endorsement of symptoms as well as a severity rating (patient impairment/distress) of at least [ADDRESS_918512] -treatment to determine whether an anxiety disorder  is the primary 
diagnosis and the presence of comorbid diagnoses. Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scal e (PARS).
80 The PARS is a 
summation of six items assessing anxiety severity, frequency, distress, avoidance, and interference and has 
been used as the primary continuous outcome measure in treatment studies.30 Clinical Global Impression -
Severity  and Improvement (CGI -S/I).81 The CGI -S/I is a 7 -point clinician rating of severity of psychopathology  
and treatment response. The CGI -I will be completed at time 2 and youth recei ving a sc ore of 1 (“very much 
improved”) or 2 (“much improved”) will be considered treatment responders.  Finally, the child and parents will 
be asked to rate the recent severity of the child’s anxiety symptoms on a 0 to 10 scale.  
 
C.9.b. Parent and Child Report Measures. Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS).82,83 This scale 
measures anxiety symptoms in six areas that correspond with the anxiety disorders in DSM -IV. Child Sheehan 
Disability Scale (CSDS).76 This scale allows the respondent to rate the degree of impairment in the child’s and 
parent’s social, school/work and family domains related to anxiety  symptoms. Child Avoidance Measure 
(CAM) .  This scale allows the respondent to rate how much the child avoids things due to their fears and 
worries.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678917] (TAS).[ADDRESS_918513] (seven items) and perceived agreement 
with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678918] (one item)  will be assessed at the end of treatment .  
 C.9.c. Parent Report Measures. Vanderbilt Assessment Scale (NICHQ) – Parent Informant. This scale is 
used to measure externalizing symptoms (i.e., ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder). Children’s Accommodation Scale  (CAS) . This form is used to rate how the parent responds to the child’s anxiety and 
distress. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21. Parent psychiatric symptoms will be assessed  at screening and 
post treatment  with the DASS21 .  Client Satisfaction Questionnaire- 8 (CSQ-8).
87 Parent satisfaction will be 
assessed at the end of treatment with t his self -report measure provided to the parent through REDCap survey . 
The modified System Usability Scale plus AC items (mSUSplus; Bangor et al., 2008; Brooke, 2013). Parents will complete the mSUSplus after treatment with anxiety coach.  
 
C.9.d. Child Report Measures.  Personal Health Question –  9. The PHQ -9 is a 9 -item self -report measure of 
depressive symptoms over the previous two weeks. Child Automatic  Thoughts Scale.  This scale measures the 
frequency of self -reported anxiety provoking thou ghts. Child Survey of Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   This is a self -reporting 
measure of how the child copes with their fears and worries. Children will rate the severity of their anxiety 
symptoms on a daily basis using a 11 -point scale on the iPod Touch.   These report measures will be provided 
to the child through REDCap survey . 
July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918514] Report Measures. The survey , conducted under IRB 14 -002608,  will be an  adaptation of the 
measures used in a previous study15 and will inquire about demographic/practice information. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s will 
be asked to indicate whether or not they have used various interventions over the past 12 months with anxious 
children and adolescents (presented separately). Additionally , therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678919]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678920].  The modified System Usability Scale plus AC items (mSUSplus; Bangor et al., 
2008; Brooke, 2013). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678921] [ADDRESS_918515] treatment measures.  
 
C.9.f. Session Coding.  All therapy sessions in the TAU and FTF -AC will be audio recorded and coded with a 
CBT for child anxiety Treatment Adherence scale that has been used in previous treatment studies, 18,67,74 in 
addition to recording the amount of time spent planning and conducting exposure. Audio recording will be used 
rather than video, as it will be easier to set -up and transport if exposures are completed outside of the office.  
Electronic communication between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678922]. These contacts will also be coded for recommendations regarding 
exposure. 10% of ses sions will be coded by [CONTACT_678999] -rater reliability.  
 C.9.f.2 Electronic Data.  All use of the Anxiety Coach system (desktop or mobile device applications) is 
automatically recorded. This data will include anxiety ratings, fear ladder items, and details on completed 
exposures. These data will be extracted to assess use of the system in all three trials. In all three trials therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678923] a study name (i.e. T1therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]1) in the Anxiety Coach system. In Trial 1, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678924] [ADDRESS_918516] will be instructed that because it is in 
development that patient names should not be entered. As such, the system will automatically assign patient 
idenitifiers (e.g., Patient #1). In Trials 2 and 3, enrolled patients will be given a study name (i.e. T2patient1).  
 
C.9.g. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678925].  The frequency and content of communication between the project director  and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678926]. All electronic communication within Anxiety Coach will be automatically saved within the web- based portal and the duration and content of phone conversations or standard electronic 
communication will be logged.  
 C.9.h. Rater Training and Integrity.  Clinician rated measures will be completed by [CONTACT_262420] 
(IEs) blind to the study hypotheses under the supervision of [CONTACT_679017], who will ensure that 
evaluations are completed acc urately and thoroughly. Therapy session recordings will be coded by a separate 
IE blind to the study hypotheses and assessment results. Dr . Whiteside will lead t raining of the independent 
evaluator s in assessment and coding including ratings of criterion tapes and review of practice assessments. 
Raters will be expected to score within 15% of [CONTACT_679025]’s  ratings on criterion cases. [CONTACT_679024] will 
review 10% of assessments and session codings completed by [CONTACT_679000] 15% range will not conduct evaluations until this level of agreement is 
achieved. After competency has been established [CONTACT_679024] will review 5% of assessment s and sessions 
codings . [CONTACT_679017] will review assessment and coding discrepancies between the IEs and [CONTACT_679026] during the study to reduce the effect of bias.   All assessments done by [CONTACT_679001]. V ickers Douglas and [CONTACT_679024] can ensure that the evaluations are 
completed accurately and thoroughly.  
 
C.9.i. Qualitative Measures. [CONTACT_161494] ckers Douglas will work with Dr . Whiteside to identify questions and topi[INVESTIGATOR_678927] a semi -structured interview script. The script will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested to ensure that questions and follow -up 
probes are easily comprehended and delivered in a sensitive manner. The semi -structured script will follow 
guidelines for minimizing bias and increasing the reliability and vali dity of interview data.
90,91 The interviews will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_679002]’ medical care or 
development of Anxiety Coach or the treatment protocols. All interviews will be audio- recorded

Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918517] statistical summaries of the 
study data. As this is a feasibility study and not powered to examine the statistical significance of group 
differences, the s tatistical analysis will be primarily descriptive in nature . 
 C.10. b. Tests of Specific Aims  
 
C.10. b.1. Aim 1: Adapt Anxiety Coach  for use with a health care provider.  Data from an open trial of 15  
patients treated with Anxiety Coach and the web- based portal in FTF -AC or MC -AC (7 to 8 per condition) will 
be analyzed descriptively. Quantitative data regarding adherence (accessing the application at least 50% of 
days) and improvement (symptom change) will be examined to ensure that patients  are utilizing and benefiting 
from treatment. For qualitative data, themes regarding usability and treatment satisfaction will be identified and a coding strategy will be developed. Analysts with experience in qualitative data analysis will code interviews

themes).

design of Trials 2 and 3 , descriptive statistics will be calculated on all fidelity (e.g., frequency of exposure), 
feasibility (e.g., quantity and content of communication between the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_476315], frequency of assessing the application), and clinical variables (e.g., means, standard deviations, percentage of patients 
continuing to meet diagnostic criteria). Consistent with the ultimate goal of generating estimates of the effect of 
Anxiety Coach, symptom change within Trials 2 and 3 will be compared between groups using repeated 
measures analysis of variance (RMA NOVA) and the frequency of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ use of exposure will be 
compared between the TAU and FTF- AC condition using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to control for 
diagnosis and symptom severity. Given that this project aims to test the feasibility of a fully powered RCT, analyses testing group differences will be considered exploratory.  Although the use of RMANOVA and 
ANCOVA has significant limitations (i.e., the treatment of missing data), the small sample size and inclusion of multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678929] a more powerful statistical approach such as a mixed -effects

4.1.1 Risks to Human Subjects  
 
4.1.1.a. Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design:  Participants and their involvement will 
include: 1) community therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678933] a survey , conducted under IRB 14 -002608, of practice 
characteristics and beliefs during Phase I; 2) 30 community therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678934], Trial 1; 3) 40 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678935] (Phase II , Trials 
2 and 3 ); and 3) 75 children with an anxiety disorder  ages 7  to 17 and one or more caregivers, anticipat ed to 
be up to 60 years of age, r eceiving study intervention ( 15 in Phase I, 60 in Phase II  Trials 2 and 3) . Children 
below the age of [ADDRESS_918520] the feasibility of the study intervention for disseminating evidence- based treatment to 
community/non- specialty settings.  
The inclusion of children with an anxiety disorder and a caregiver is necessary to examine the 
feasibility of improving treatment  outcome for children with anxiety disorders. T he project includes children, a 
special population, because this population is particularly at risk for not receiving evidence- based care and the 
project’s aim is to improve access to cognitive behavioral treatment for childhood anxiety disorders. Children 
will be recruited through participating community therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678936] a 
test of the intervention’s feasibility for improving care in community , non -research settings. Parents  will provide 
consent for themselves and their child to participate. Children will provide assent .  
 
4.1.1.b. Sources of Materials : Research material  will be collected from  the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678937] [ADDRESS_918521] survey materials will include demographics, frequency 
of treating patients with anxiety disorders, frequency of using a variety of therapy strategies,  beliefs about 
exposure therapy , opi[INVESTIGATOR_678938], and report of how often and why they 
chose to use the application. Reponses to the survey will be initially individually identifiable to allow recruitment of eligible the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_678939]. Only the staff at survey research center (SRC) will have access to this 
individually identifiable data, which will not be shared with the project researchers or other study staff.  
Following consent, but prior to participation in Phas e II Trials [ADDRESS_918522] -provided audio recordings of treatment sessions that the independent evaluators 
use to code the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ use of treatment principles. The recordings will not be identifiable (i.e., they will be label ed with code numbers described below). The final material collected from therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678940]-
administration of the beliefs about exposures questionnaire from the survey in IRB 14 -002608 . 
Material collected directly from the participants (child and c aregiver) will be responses to behavioral 
ratings scales, psychiatri c interviews, data entered into the Anxiety Coach application, and session content  
from audio recordings . The therapy sessions will be recorded by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_11437], transferred to the study team 
via the secure intervention web- portal, labeled with a code number (see below) by [CONTACT_9137], and 
coded by [CONTACT_679004]. All other data will be collected and entered by [CONTACT_679004].  
Appropriate steps will be tak en to ensure the confidentiality of data from survey respondents, study 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], patients, and parents.  To begin with , participants (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], patients, and caregivers)  will be 
assigned study codes that are not based on the individual’s  information. All written, electronic, and audio 
recording material and data will be identified only by [CONTACT_104846]. The key linking participants  to study codes will be 
kept in a locked cabinet separate from the data.  All paper -generated data will be stored in locked files in the 
office of [CONTACT_679024]. All computer -generated data will be maintained in password- limited, secure network 
drive files.  All identifiable information from the survey will have the same level of protection with the addition of 
being managed by [CONTACT_679005]. To protect patient confidentiality, only

Whiteside 13- [ADDRESS_918523] the right to review research 
records. Confidentiality of those records will be protected to the ex tent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. Research records will 
be kept separate from identifying information in a locked cabinet and will not be released without the 
participant’s consent unless required by [CONTACT_2371]. Identifying information will be removed prior to publication and 
presentation of the study results.  The Anxiety Coach application will not have any fields that request 
identifiable in Phase I or II, Trials 1, 2, or 3.  
 
4.1.1.c. Potential Risks : The risks of participating in this project are considered to be minimal and include 
completing relatively lengthy research measures , the potential to be randomized to a condition with less 
effective treatment,  and breach of confidentiality. The methods to address these potential risks are outlined 
below  in Section 4.1.2.b.  
 One potential risk of participating in this project includes discomfort during the data collection (survey, 
phone screenings, and assessments)  related to discussing sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_678941]. 
However, the length of material completed by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_678942]. It is estimated 
that the survey will require [ADDRESS_918524] on the quality of the patient’s treatment. In fact, the study requirement of a minimum of [ADDRESS_918525] (with the 
assistance of the study staff under the direction of Dr . Whiteside)  will assist the family in making arrangements 
for appropriate care.  
More generally, the study includes potential risks related to psychotherapy. In rare cases 
psychotherapy may exacerbate symptoms. Should a patient’s symptoms increase significantly anytime during the study and require discontinuation of study treatment, families will be connected with appropriate alternative 
treatments outside the study protocol including psychotropic medication, additional ps ychotherapy, or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. In addition, as with all treatment , the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678943]’s  emotional well -
being and pace therapy appropriately (i.e., recommending a slower pace or “exposure breaks”). The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678944] -child interactions and the parent’s emotional state to determine if further action is 
indicated. Moreover,  the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678945].  
The confidentiality of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], in addition to patients (children and caregivers), will be maintained 
through the procedures described above in Section 4.1.1.b. To minimize risk, identifiable information from the 
survey will only be available to the SRC. However, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s inclusion in the pool of providers eligible for 
participation in Phase II impli es an endorsement of openness to CBT and infrequent use of exposure. 
However, this is thought to pose a limited risk as previous research suggests such responses will be the norm. During recruitment, the structure of phone screenings will allow therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678946] a manner 
that does not imply a history of disciplinary action.

July 1, 2019 (Version 12 ) 
 
Whiteside 13- 000288  Page 22  4.1.2.a. Recruitment and Informed Consent : Recruitment will begin with a survey sent to all mental health 
providers contracted by [CONTACT_679006] 14- 002608. The survey will include consent language 
approved by [CONTACT_679007]. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_678947] (i.e., the follow -up to nonresponders). The SRC will provide a de -identified data set to the 
study team who will identify all eligible participants. The SRC will provide the name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_19297] 
a randomly selected recruitment pool of 80 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (or more if needed), but not the associated code 
numbers. During the screening phone call placed by [CONTACT_52931], the study will be described (including 
inclusion crite ria) and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678948]. Those interested will have the consent form 
reviewed and be mailed two copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (one to return, one for their records). Only after one copy of the written consent form has been received will the study s taff verify that the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678949] a 
history of disciplinary action. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678950] . 
Patients (children and caregivers) will be recruit ed for participation in the study  by [CONTACT_679008][INVESTIGATOR_11437] . During the initial evaluation the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678951] 
a prepared script. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678952] a study packet and 
encourag e them to contact [CONTACT_679009] . The study coordinator will conduct a phone 
screening with the caregiver including questions to assess the presence of an anxiety disorder  and obtain 
other information relevant to inclusion and excl usion criteria (e.g., diagnostic and treatment history). Those 
who are determined to be ineligible will be offered other treatment options including treatment  with the referring 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], an evaluation at Mayo Clinic outside of the study if appropriate, and resources for finding other 
providers.  Those who appear to be eligible will be scheduled for the videophone Consent and Evaluation visit. 
During the initial part of this visit, the patient and parents will be given a review of the informed consent 
document including information about the treatment options within the study , potential risks and benefits of 
study participation, as well as any alternatives to participating in research. The investigators will try to foster an 
open exchange of information and will encourage the child and caregivers to ask questions and discuss 
concerns.  It will be the responsibility of [CONTACT_679024] to ensure that all participants (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], patients, and 
caregivers) have provided consent/assent and understand their role in the research. Participants will be told 
that they can discontinue participation at any time, or refuse to answer any study questions, without adverse 
consequences.  If patients and caregivers are interested in participation, a copy of the consent and assent  
documents will be signed and placed in the postage -paid envelope included with the study packet. To 
minimize delay in beginning therapeutic treatment, the pre- treatment evaluation will be conducted at this visit. 
However, patients will not be considered t o be enrolled in the study until the signed consent/assent documents 
have been received and signed by [CONTACT_464]. In the event that data is collected but signed consent/assent documents are not received, data will be excluded from any research- related act ivities or analyses. Data on 
screening, eligibility decisions, and enrollment will be tracked .  
 
4.1.2.b. Protections Against Risk:  
At the time this application was submitted the Research Committees within the Department of 
Psychiatry and Psychology and the Department of Pediatrics with Mayo Clinic approved  all study procedures 
including the language in the consent and assent forms to ensure that it is simple and understandable.  Prior to 
the onset of the study, the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board will  also approve these materials . The 
research team will carefully protect the confidentiality of all participant research information. Investigators are 
required to undergo and periodically renew training in research ethics and HIPAA. Given their role in recruiting 
patients, participating t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_678953].  All paper -generated data, computer -
generat ed data, and session recordings will be labeled with code number unrelated to the patients ’ identifying 
information. All paper -generated data will be stored in locked files in the office of [CONTACT_679024] or the SRC . All 
computer -generated data and session recordings will be maintained in password- limited, secure network drive 
files. Participant names (or other identifying information) will not be kept on the study measures. Instead code 
numbers will be used and the key linking code numbers with participant identifiers will be kept in locked files 
separately fro m the data. Only [CONTACT_679024] and the study coordinator (or the SRC for survey data) will have 
access to the code key . To protect the confidentiality of data collected through the Anxiety Coach application 
no-identifiable information will be requested. Specifically, rather than requesting full names and birthdates, the 
system will generate identifiers (e.g. Patient #1)  rather than names and allow entry of ages  but not birthdates .

for research purposes.  
 
To decrease the likelihood that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678954] a continuous process 
by: [CONTACT_679010], routinely assessing participant (patient and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) comfort with the study, reviewing the study components that have been completed and that are 
upcoming at each evaluation time point, supporting non- billable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678955] , reimbursing participant families for their time to complete study assessments, and allowing 
participants (patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) to  keep an iPod Touch. To decrease the likelihood that youth will feel 
coerced by [CONTACT_679011], the IE who completes the enrollment assessment will directly ask the 
child if s/he is interested in participating. If the IE has concerns about tha t the child is feeling coerced he will 
ask to speak to both the child and the parent individually to gather further information, and then discuss his/he 
concerns with the PI. If patients deteriorate or develop clinical crises the investigators may recommend 
adjunctive treatment or study termination. Prematurely terminated participants may continue with study 
treatment and provide assessment data.  All participants randomized to treatment conditions will be included in 
data analyses and the circumstances sur rounding missing data will be recorded.  
Thorough screening and assessment will aim to rule out psychiatric conditions in children and 
caregivers that may prevent families from participating in the study. Once in the study  families will be followed 
closely by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678956]. Whiteside.  [CONTACT_679024], the treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541],  an 
intervention specialist or a covering clinician through the Mayo Clinic Division of Child Psychiatry and 
Psychology will be available for research subjects 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Side effects and adverse 
events will be monitored closely throughout the study. Specifically, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (or eval uator) will conduct a 
general inquiry at each contact [CONTACT_679012] , adverse events, self -harm, or any health 
complaints. If at any point during the study participants develop elevated risk for harm to self or others, or 
experience increased sym ptoms, appropriate treatment will be instituted. Reported complaints will be coded on 
a standardized form as Mild (minor complaint causing no interference and not requiring intervention), Moderate (more than minimal problem, source of some interference and may require intervention), Severe (significant 
complaint, definite interference requiring intervention), or Serious (life threatening, a potential for long- term 
disability, and/or requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Based on the nature of the complaint the independent evaluator will 
determine whether it is related to the study, and [CONTACT_679024] will take appropriate action (e.g., monitoring, 
adjunctive intervention, removal from study). Any cases of suspected abuse will be reported consistent with the 
roles of mandated reporters by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_678957]. Whiteside.  Any instances of 
suspected malpractice by [CONTACT_484214][INVESTIGATOR_678958], the ethics code of the American Psychological Associ ation, and the credentialing body of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678959].  
Protections related to subjects with depression or suicidal ideation are as follows: Patients who  endorse 
severe depression or suicidal ideation during the screening phone call or the initial evaluation will not be enrolled in the study. Patients who endorse mild to moderate depression that is secondary to a primary anxiety 
disorder during the screening, initial assessment, or post -treatment assessment will be allowed to participate in 
the study. In all cases  of severe or moderate depression, the project director will communicate the results of 
the patient’s depression evaluation to the treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. If during any contact [CONTACT_679013], appropri ate steps will be taken by [CONTACT_52931] , [CONTACT_679024], and/or the 
treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678960]’s safety, i.e. emergent evaluation or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
 The PI ([CONTACT_679026]) is a board- certified child psychologist  with extensive experience treating youth with anxiety 
disorders, including comorbid suicidality . [CONTACT_679024] will follow standard policies and procedures developed 
by [CONTACT_679014] t of Psychiatry and Psyc hology, e.g., 
comprehensive assessment of depressive symptomatology, assessment of suicidal ideation (inclusive of intent, means, plan), immediate notification to the subject’s legal guardian, and referral to the Mayo Clinic Child 
and Adolescent Inpatient Psychiatry unit (in cases of immediate lethality). Implementation of strategies to

Attrition Prevention procedures and guidelines will be followed, based on an adaptation of the MTA’s 
procedural manual (ASAP)94 similar to other NIMH clinical trials (e.g., MTA, POTS).  Under ASAP guidelines 
situations that require interventions will be addressed in a manner that responds appropriately to the emergent 
clinical needs of the participant families, while, to the extent possible, maintaining the integrity of randomization 
(i.e., preventing attrition), and limiting contam ination of study treatments. This approach is adopted to maintain 
subjects in the study and intent -to-treat analyses.  
In cases where children are receiving anxiety -related medications prior to the period of study eligibility, 
or where initiation (or discontinuation) of a medication during the study period seems clinically necessary, this 
care will be managed by [CONTACT_679015]. Although we expect that medication changes will be minimal or 
absent, if such occur, we will analyze outcomes from patients with and without medication changes occurring 
during the course of the study to determine if changes in outcomes are attributable to medication changes.   
 
4.1.3  Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human  Subjects and Others  
 Participants in the study potentially will benefit from receiving a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation 
and treatment for childhood anxiety  and access to a novel treatment aide (either during or after the study 
period in the treatment as usual condition) . Although this study is designed to develop the treatment, rather 
than demonstrate efficacy, participants will likely experience improvement in symptom s and functioning. In 
addition, the patients will be compensat ed $25 for pre -assessment and $[ADDRESS_918529] -assessment (total of $50)  
and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678961] $[ADDRESS_918530]  will 
be able to keep the iPod Touch. Benef its to others are discussed in Section  4.1.4 . 
 
4.1.4  Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
The primary benefit to society is the creation of a novel tool for 1) disseminating evidenced- based 
treatment for childhood anxiety disorders to practitioners and 2) providing effective care to children who have 
limited access to brick and mortar mental health facilities. Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric 
disorders in childhood with prevalence rates as high as 15% , but the least likely to be treated (approximately 
30%) .1-[ADDRESS_918531] into adulthood.5-8 In 
addition to improving the lives of children with anxiety disorders  and their families, increased access to 
treatment has a benefit for society as a whole by [CONTACT_679016] -related costs of anxiety disorders .

monitor data and safety thr ough annual progress reports. Drs. Whiteside (with consultation from Drs. 
Abramowitz, Ollendick, and Andersson) will review data at the end of the open trial and pi[INVESTIGATOR_678962]. As noted in Sections 4.1.1.b.  the 
confidentiality of research data will be closely guarded through separating identifying information from patient 
responses and storing all data in locked or password protected locations. [CONTACT_679024] has overall 
responsibility  for monitoring the integrity of the study data and patient safety under the oversight of the IRB . [CONTACT_679026] will be responsible for reviewing and reporting to the IRB plans for data and safety monitoring, 
reviewing adverse event reports, monitoring da ta integrity during the study, and interpreting the relevance to 
the study of any external scientif ic or therapeutic developments.  
The following procedures will be followed to ensure participant safety: a) Participants at increased risk 
for adverse events will be excluded from the study (e.g., actively suicidal, psychosis, below age 7); b) 
Participants’ symptoms will be closely monitor ed throughout the study by [CONTACT_137330][INVESTIGATOR_541] , intervention 
specialists, and [CONTACT_679024]; c) Participants will be offered additional , emergent treatment as needed; d) the 
study staff will meet weekly to discuss participant safety; and e) T he adequacy  of safety procedures and the 
safety of participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_1201].  
The following procedures will be followed in reporting adverse events: All adverse events occurring 
during the study, including those not meeting the criteria of an Unanticipated Serious Adverse Event ([LOCATION_003]E)  
will be recorded on the appropriate case report form.  Records of these events will be maintained and reports 
submitted to the IRB according to the regulatory requirements.  Expected serious  adverse events (SAEs) and 
nonsignificant (not serious) adverse events  (AEs)  will be reported to the IRB at the annual review . Expected 
adverse events and anticipated adverse device effects are those listed in the protocol , investigational device 
information,  or consent docum ents as a potential risk factor.  [LOCATION_003]Es will be reported to the IRB within five 
working days of learning of it using the Reportable Event form in the IRB electronic system.

Study Name : [CONTACT_668718]-CIP-[ADDRESS_903189] stimulation (SCS) involves the application of electrical stimulation to the large 
myelinated f ibers of the dorsal column via electrical leads placed  in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814]. SCS is 
minimally invasive , reversible1 and has been used successfully to help manage a variety of pain 
conditions including diabetic neuropathy,[ADDRESS_903190] care. An examination of the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database estimates that 82% - 84% of pati ents eligible for SCS will require an MRI at some point within 5 years of 
implant.

MRI is a diagnostic method for viewing high quality two and three -dimensional images of the body. 
MRI systems generate three electromagnetic fields (i.e. a static magnetic field, a time -varying 
gradient magnetic field, and a radiofrequency field) that are used to produce the image. All three of these fields interact with implanted devices, creating h azards for the device, the subject, or both. Due 
to these risks, currently marketed implantable generators (IPGs), leads, or accessories may  be 
contraindicated  for use in an MRI environment.  
Abbott (formerly St. Jude Medical) has developed MR conditional neurostimulation systems designed to mitigate such interactions. These systems provide the option for conditionally safe scanning of subjects when the scan is performed according to approved guidelines. MRI compatible devices 
improve patient care by [CONTACT_668699].  
The devices used in this study have received CE mark and are being implanted in subjects.  CE mark 
was granted based on preclinical device testing. This study will be conducted as a post -market clinical 
follow up (PMCF) study to collect additional scientific data to support the CE label  for Prodigy 
MRI™ and Proclaim Elite™ systems. Patients with an existin g Prodigy MRI or Proclaim Elite MR 
conditional system  who either undergo an MRI scan as standard of care, or agree to  an MRI scan for 
study purposes , will be interviewed before the scan, after the scan, and [ADDRESS_903191] meet the specific eligibility criteria and provide informed consent to participate in the study.  
 SJM- CIP-[ZIP_CODE] 
Study Name : [CONTACT_668718]-CIP-[ADDRESS_903192] harm. The following potential adverse effects may occur in the MRI environment: 
• Lead electrode heating resulting in tissue damage or serious subject injury  
• IPG heating resulting in tissue damage in the implant pocket or subject discomfort or both 
• Induced currents on leads resulting in overstimulation or shocking sensations 
• Damage to the IPG or leads causing the system to fail to deliver stimulation or causing the system to deliver overstimulation  
• Damage to the functionality or mechanical integrity of the IPG resulting in the inability to communicate with the IPG  
• Movement or vibration of the IPG or leads  
 Residual risks associated with the study device, as identif ied in the risk analysis report.  
The clinical risks associated with neurostimulation systems for SCS applications are well known.  
Many of the clinical risks may develop as a consequence of not following the manufacturer recommended guidelines at the time o f performing the MRI scans.  
Any potential residual risks are considered to be outweighed by [CONTACT_111333], and the overall residual risk was determined to be acceptable. Clinical evidence demonstrates acceptable safety and performance of the study device.  
 Risks associated with participation in the clinical study  
The risks involved with this study are comparable to those associated with the implant of any other  
commercially available MR conditional SCS  system.  
 Risk -to-benefit rationale  
Since no design changes exist between the Prodigy MRI and Proclaim Elite MR conditional SCS system s and the predicate SCS system s, except for implementation of the MRI Mode, the non- MR 
performance of these products is already well established.  
 
In addition, the clinical evidence demonstrates that the safety and performance of the study device, when used under the conditions and for the purposes intended, as specified by [CONTACT_3455], are in compliance with the Requirements of the AIMD Directi ve 90/385/EEC, including the 
Essential Requirements.

 Indication for Use  
The Prodigy MRI  and Proclaim Elite  SCS systems are indicated as an aid in the management of 
chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with the following: failed back surgery syndrome and intractable low back and leg pain. 
 Description  of the study d evices  
Please refer to the country - and device -specific IFU for additional information regarding the devices 
used in this clinical investigation.  
The Proclaim Elite system is MR conditional for scans of the head, extremit ies (upper except 
shoulder, lower except hip) , or any other body part. The Prodigy MRI system is only MR 
conditional for scans of the head and extremities (upper except shoulder, lower except hip). Scan requirements for each system  (Proclaim Elite and Prodigy MRI)/lead (Octro de and Penta) 
combination are provided in the MRI Procedure Information Manual. 
Clinically relevant MRI safety  criteria identified by [CONTACT_99894]. Jude Medical (now Abbott) are unchanged 
between the Prodigy MRI and Proclaim Elite systems. Additional Proof of Safety  testing has 
demonstrated that the Proclaim Elite device satisfies these same criteria when used with a body RF

this study, this clinical investigation plan adds the requirement of having a Clinician Progr ammer 
(for Proclaim devices) or a Rapid Programmer (for Prodigy devices) present at every MRI scan.  The MRI Procedure I nformation  manual allows for the determination of whether conditions ha ve 
been satisfied by [CONTACT_668702]. This labeling 
allows  radiologists and MR technologists to identify MR conditional components and assess 
whether their MRI equipment can safely scan a subject  implanted with a n Abbott (formerly St. Jude 
Medical)  MR conditional SCS system. Guidance is also provided to the physician and subject on 
how to prepare for a n MRI scan.  
 Additionally, a Subject Identification (ID) Card is provided to all subject s as labeling that al lows 
for identification of their implanted neurostimulation system in support of determining if the subject  
has an MR conditional system.   Additional resources (including the MRI Procedure Information manual) for ensuring that the MRI scan complies with the MRI conditional labeling can be obtained from the Sponsor or found on the 
following websites:

A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be formed as best practice to ensure that the primary 
outcome is  as free from bias as  possible. The CEC will review and adjudicate reportable adverse 
events as defined in the CEC charter  for seriousness,  device- relatedness, and MRI -relatedness. 
 Description of the m ethods that will be used to address potentially confounding factors  
Stratified analysis will be used to diagnose the potential confounding factors, and multiple regression will be used to adjust the outcome of the primary endpoint in case confounding factors are identified. The factors of interest can be, but are not limited to:  
• Subject baseline characteristics  
• Use of other medical devices  
 Criteria and p rocedures for s ubject withdrawal or discontinuation  
Each subject should remain in the study  until completion of the required follow up period; however, 
a subject’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time. Should this occur, the reason 
for discontinuation must be documented in the withdrawal form.  Subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the study at any time , and for any 
reason , without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled and 
that withdrawal from the study will not jeopardize their future medical care or relationship with the 
Investigator. Subjects will be asked to specify the reason for the termination but have the right not 
to answer.  
 The Investigator may decide to withdraw a subject from the study at any time with reasonable 
rationale. The subject’s future care will not be influenced by a decision, voluntary or otherwise, to 
withdraw from the study . All reasonable efforts should be made to retain the subject in the clinical 
study until completion of the study. 
 Reasons for subject’s withdrawal include, but are not limited to: 
• Subject refuses to continue participating in the study  
• Subject does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and does not require additional follow -
up for safety reasons.  
• Subject is deceased (cause must be documented)  
• Subject’s non- compliance  
• Subject’s participation is terminated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] I nvestigator, although the subject consented, 
since participation is no longer medically appropriate  
• Subject is ‘lost to follow up’:  Subject does not adhere to the scheduled follow up visits but has 
not explicitly requested to be withdrawn from the clinical study t his does not apply to missed 
visits). Site personnel should make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with the subject to achieve subject compliance to the scheduled follow up visits: o A subject will be considered ‘Lost to Follow Up’ after a minimum of [ADDRESS_903212]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]. 
o If these attempts are unsuccessful, a letter should be sent to the subject’s last known address or general practitioner (GP) and a copy of this letter should be maintained in the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].  
 
 SJM- CIP-[ZIP_CODE] 
Study Name : [CONTACT_668718]-CIP-[ADDRESS_903213]’s reasons for 
withdrawal on a Withdrawal CRF.  
 No additional follow –up will be required or data recorded from subjects once withdrawn from the 
clinical investigation. 
 COMPLIANCE TO CIP  
 Statements of compliance  
The study will be performed in accordance with the most current versions of the World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki, and any regional and/or national regulations as appropriate.  The current version of the harmonized ISO14155 shall be used as a guideline.   The Investigator will not start enrolling subjects or requesting informed consent from any subject 
prior to obtaining IRB/EC approval and Competent Authority approval, if appli cable, and 
authorization from the sponsor in writing for the study.    In case additional requirements are imposed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC or Competent Authority, those requirements will be followed, if appropriate. If any action is taken by [CONTACT_2717]/EC, and regulator y 
requirements with respect to the study, that information will be forwarded to Abbott.  As sponsor, Abbott has taken up general liability insurance in accordance with the requirements of 
the applicable local laws.  If required, additional subject coverage  or a study specific insurance will be provided by [CONTACT_668705].  
 Adherence to the Clinical Investigation Plan  
A deviation is defined as an event where the clinical I nvestigator, site personnel, sponsor or sponsor 
representative did not conduct the c linical study according to the Clinical Investigational Plan, 
IRB/EC requirements , or the Investigator Agreement. The Investigator is not allowed to deviate 
from the CIP, except as specified under emergency circumstances.   
 In some cases, failure to comply with the CIP may be considered failure to protect the rights, safety 
and well -being of subjects, since the non- compliance exposes subjects to unreasonable risks. For 
example, failure to adhere to the inclusion/exclusion criteria: these criteria are specifically defined by [CONTACT_668706]. This may be considered failure to protect the rights, safety , and well -being of 
the enrolled subject. Similarly, failure to p erform safety assessments intended to detect adverse 
events may be cons idered failure to protect the rights, safety and well- being of the enrolled subject. 
Investigators should seek minimization of such risks by [CONTACT_110596].  Simultaneously, in the  event that adhering to the CIP might expose the subject to unreasonable 
risks, the I nvestigator is also required to protect the rights, safety , and well -being of the subject by 
 [CONTACT_632185]- CIP-[ZIP_CODE] 
Study Name : [CONTACT_668718]-CIP-[ADDRESS_903214] enrolled in 
an investigation.  Regulations require that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_115656], complete, and current records, including documents showing the date of , and reason for , every deviation from the Clinical Investigational 
Plan.  Relevant information for each deviation will be documented on a Deviation Case Report 
Form. The site will submit the CRF to Abbott.  Regulation s require Investigators obtain approval from Abbott and the IRB/EC ( as required ) before 
initiating changes in or deviations from the protocol, except when necessary to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency.   Prior approval must be requested when the PI [INVESTIGATOR_115657], contemplates, or makes a conscious decision to depart from the CIP, except when unforeseen circumstances are beyond the Investigator’s control (e.g. a subject who fails to attend a scheduled follow -up visit, a subject is too 
ill to perform a CIP -require d test, etc.). All deviations, including those beyond the I nvestigat or’s 
control, must be reported on a CRF.  To obtain approval, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_668678].  
 All deviations must be reported to appropriate regulatory authorities in specified timelines (if appropriate).  The Investigator is required to adhere to local regulatory requirements for reporting deviations to 
IRB/EC.  
 Repeated and serious non -compliance  
In the event of repeated non -compliance or a one -time serious non -compliance, as determined by 
[CONTACT_1034], a Clinical Research Associate or clinical representative will attempt to secure  
compliance by [CONTACT_294263]: 
• Visiting the Investigator 
• Contact[CONTACT_668707] 
• Contact[CONTACT_668708]  
• Retraining of the Investigator 
 
If an Investigator is found to be repeatedly non- compliant with the signed agreement, the CIP or 
any other conditions of the clinical study, the Sponsor will either secure compliance or, at its sole discretion, terminate the Investigator’s participation in the clinical investigation.

Determination should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, evidence of alternative etiology, medical/biologic plausibility, and patient condition (pre-existing condition). 
 Procedure for assessing, recording and reporting AEs, ADEs, SADEs :  
Safety surveillance within this study and the safety reporting, both performed by [CONTACT_737], 
starts as soon as the subject is enrolled in this study  (date of signature [CONTACT_668721]) . The 
safety surveillance and the safety reporting will continue until the last study visit has been 
performed, the subject is deceased, the subject/ Investigator concludes his participation in the study 
or the subject/I nvestigator withdraws the subject from the study. 
 Records related  to the subject’s subsequent medical course must be maintained and submitted (as 
applicable) to the Sponsor until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained. Adverse events will be monitored until they are adequately resolved. The status of the subject’s condition should be 
documented at each visit.   
 Adverse event data will be collected througho ut the clinical study and will be reported to the 
Sponsor on a dedicated case report form.  
 
Reportable events to sponsor are considered:  
1. All Serious Adverse Events 
2. All procedure- (e.g., MRI scan) or device-related Adverse Events (whether or not the event is considered serious). 
 
SAE Reporting 
The investigator should report all SAEs to the Sponsor as soon as possible but no later than outlined below.   
Clinical Site  Reporting timelines

the site personnel became aware of the event or as per the investigative site’s local 
requirements, if the requirement is more stringent than those outlined.  
 
The date the site staff became aware the event met the criteria of an SAE must be recorded in the source document.  The Investigator will further report the SAE to the local IRB/EC according to the institution’s IRB/EC reporting requirements.  
 The Sponsor will ensure that all events are reported to the relevant authorities as per regulations.  
 
Foreseeable Adverse Effects  
In addition to the adverse events commonly associated with surgery, the following adverse effects  
are associated with implanting or using the neurostimulation for SCS.  
 List of foreseeable adverse effects: 
• Unpleasant sensations or motor disturbances, inclu ding involuntary movement, caused by 
[CONTACT_668709] (i f either occurs, turn off the IPG immediately) 
• Undesirable changes in stimulation, which may be related to cellular changes in tissue around the electrodes, changes in electrode position, l oose electrical connections, or lead failure  
• Stimulation in unwanted places  
• Lead migration, causing changes in stimulation or reduced pain relief 
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_307865], hematoma, infection, spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377], or paralysis from placement of a lead in th e epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814]  
• Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) leakage  
• Paralysis, weakness, clumsiness, numbness, or pain below the level of the implant

• Seroma (mass or swelling) at the IPG site  
• Allergic or rejection response to implant materials  
• Implant (IPG)  migration or skin erosion around the implant 
• Battery failure or battery leakage  
Changes in stimulation parameters may occur due to the failure of, or changes in, components over time, which results in:
 
• Understimulation  
• Return  of underlying symptoms 
• Overstimulation  
• Premature battery depletion  
• The need to explant the device  
The following potential adverse effects may occur in the MRI environment:  
• Lead electrode heating resulting in tissue damage or serious subject injury  
• IPG heating resulting in tissue damage in the implant pocket, or subject discomfort, or both 
• Induced currents on leads resulting in overstimulation or shocking sensations 
• Damage to  the IPG or leads causing the system to fail deliver stimulation or causing the system 
to deliver overstimulation  
• Damage to the functionality or mechanical integrity of the IPG resulting in the inability to communicate with the IPG

MRI -scan related adverse event rate will be summarized  as the proportion of subjects who have of 
MRI -scan related events. The primary endpoint will be tested at the 5% significance level.  The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if the 95% U CB for MRI scan -related adverse event rate is less tha n 
0.10. Confidence intervals will be calculated based on the Clopper -Pearson exact  method for 
binomial proportion. 
The performance goal of 10% is based on performance goals used by [CONTACT_668715].14-17 
• Analysis for secondary endpoint 
The success  of each of secondary endpoint  will be summarized as the number of success and its 
percentage, together with its 95% confidence interval estimated using Clopper- Pearson exact 
method for binomial distribution.  
 Sample size  
The sample size estimation i s based on the study design, the purpose of the study, and the primary 
endpoint, namely the MRI scan- related adverse event  rate. 
The performance goal for MRI scan-related adverse event rate is 10%. Assuming using MRI 
conditional SCS system s, the MRI scan-related adverse event rate would  achieve 1%. A sample 
size of 46 scans will be able to provide 80% power at one -sided significant level of 5% for this 
endpoint. Data from only [ADDRESS_903222] s 
will be enrolled  and scanned . Assuming the dropout rate between the enrollment and the MRI scan -
visit is about 5%, the total expected sample size is 49 (46/0.95). The sample size was calculated 
using SAS version 9.3.

 Procedures that take into account all the data  
All subjects who have signed a n Informed Consent will be considered enrolled in the clinical 
investigation (refer to Section 4.8.2). However, it is anticipated that there will be subjects  who are 
enrolled in the study but will not be included in the primary endpoint analysis, such as: 
• Subjects who are enrolled but do not meet baseline inclusion or meet exclusion criteria before 
the MRI scan; these are considered as screen failures  
• Subjects who are enrolled but do not receive a MRI scan  
 The treatment of missing, unused or spurious data,  including drop- outs and withdrawals  
No imputation technique will be used, unless specified in the guidelines of the questionnaire data.

 The minimum and maximum number  of subjects to be included for each center  
This study is expected to enroll 49 subjects who are previously implanted with a  Proclaim Elite or  
Prodigy MRI neurostimulator at  up to 30 centers. From a statistical perspective, there is no 
expectation for heterogeneity across centers, therefore the minimum number of subjects required 
from enrolling centers is 1 and the maximum number of subjects is 49. 
 DOCUMENT RETENTION

2 D 25 JUL 2019  US sites  are now 
allowed in the study to 
increase enrollment and to increase Abbott’s ability to evaluate Proclaim devices (more 
commonly used at US 
sites) . 
   Enrollment rate was 
adjusted following the addition of US sites. The e stimated time 
needed to enroll this subject population remains the same in current update (6 years) because enrollment  in 
previous protocol update (March 2019) did not reflect the situation in the field.  
 Reporting subject death to applicable committee according to geographic location.    Update of informed consent language  
according to the latest Abbott standard and in view of adding US sites to the study.   
Device functionality check further specified.  
Wording added that supplements MRI Procedure Information 
Manual to allow Section 4.2 now clarifies that the 
study will be conducted in up to 10 sites in the US, in addition to the approximately 20 sites in Europe.  
 
Similarly, Section 12.11 is 
updated to indicate that subjects will be enrolled at up to 30 centers.  Section 4.4 was updated to indicate that, with the addition of US sites, Abbott expects enrollment rate for patients requiring MRIs with an eligib le 
MR conditional device to be no more than 10 subjects per year .  
       In case of death, the investigator will need to notify the IRB (for US sites) or EC (for EU sites) per IRB/EC policy. EC has been added to this version of the protocol (Section 8.2.1).  Informed consent section (Section 4.9.1) has been updated.   Special Circumstances for Informed Consent (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) has been updated with US HIPAA compliant statement.  
 
Section 6.2 and Section 6.5.1 has 
been updated to specify that data  
collection regarding device functionality includes impedance check , performed before the MRI 
scan. This can only be done  when

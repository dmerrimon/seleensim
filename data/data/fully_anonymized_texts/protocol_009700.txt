3.3.4 .
Study Assessments: See Section 5 of the protocol for detailed information regarding study assess ments.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size : A sample size of 150 sub jects (75 sub jects per treatment group) is planned based  on the primary 
comparison of the proportion of subjects with IMACS DOI (as def ined under the primary objective) at Day 169 
(Week 24) between the SC abatacept group and the placebo group o n a background of standard treatment.
A sample size of 150 subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the SC abatacept group and p lacebo group will yield a 
power of approximately 90% to detect a treatment difference of 27% in the rate of IMACS DOI between the 
[ADDRESS_137359]. This power estimate assumes a two-sided alpha 
level of 5%, IMACS DOI rate of 60% in the abatacept group and 3 3% in the placebo group.
The 60% estimate of IMACS DOI i n the abatacept gr oup was based on reported rates of IMACS DOI in studies of 
patients with Myositis on combination therapy with another biol ogic agent
36. It is expected th at the rate of IMACS 
DOI on abatacept in combination with standard treatment should b e similar to that observed with the use of another 
biologic agent in combination with standard treatment. Randomiz ation will be stratified g lobally by 3 stratification 
variables: (1) Dermatomyositis (DM) vs non-DM IIM, (2) presence  or absence of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), (3) 
Japan vs rest of world (ROW).
Endpoints :
Primary Endpoint  
•Proportion of subjects who achieve IMACS DOI at Week 24 without  rescue
Secondary Endpoints 
•Mean change in muscle endurance using the myositis function ind ex (FI-2) from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24. 
•Mean change in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) from baseline to Weeks 12 and 
24.
•Mean change in Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool (MDAAT ) from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24.
•Mean change in Myositis Response Criteria score from baseline t o Weeks 12 and 24.
Safety Endpoints
•All adverse events (AEs/SAEs)
•AEs of interest (serious infections, malignancies, injection si te reactions, systemic reactions)
•Laboratory test abnormalities

include analyses of the primary, secondary and exploratory endp oints. The primary comparison of proportion of 
subjects in IMACS DOI at Week 24 between the abatacept and plac ebo arms will be assessed using a logistic 
regression model. The logistic regression model will include ba seline IMACS (continuous variable) and 
randomization stratification variables of diagnosis (Dermatomyo sitis [DM] vs non-DM IIM), Interstitial Lung disease 
status (present vs. absent), Japan vs. ROW to account for random ization stratification. All s ubjects who discontinue 
prematurely prior to reaching the Week [ADDRESS_137360] ed for analyses related to the secondary and exploratory 
endpoints. Appropriate summary statistics will be provided for the analysis of each endpoint.
Safety summaries for the Week 24 analysis w ill include all adverse events (AEs ) reported during the D ouble-Blind 
Period and presented by [CONTACT_6660] (abatacept vs. placebo ). AEs will be summarized from the first dose date in 
the study up to first dose date in the Open-Label Period or las t dose date in the  Double-Blind Peri od + [ADDRESS_137361] one infusion of 
a treatment regimen being assessed at any time will be included  in the safety and efficacy analyses. Detailed definition 
of population for analyses will be included in the protocol.
An analyses will be performed for the study once all subjects c omplete their week 52 assessment and/or all follow-up 
visits up to [ADDRESS_137362] dose visit.
An analysis for the long-term efficacy and safety for subjects from Japan will be performed including data collected 
up to Week 76.
A final analysis will be performed for the study when all subje cts complete the long-term open label extension and/or 
the follow-up period of the study.

2.[ADDRESS_137367]/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and  dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20291]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recrui tment materials 
(e.g., advertisements), and any other written i nformation to be provided to subjects. The 
investigator, Sponsor or designee should also provide the IRB/IE C with a copy of the Investigator 
Brochure or product labeling information to be provided to subje cts and any updates. 
The investigator, Sponsor or designee s hould provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates a nd other 
information (e.g., exped ited safety reports, amendments, and ad ministrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures.
2.[ADDRESS_137368] ensure that subjects are clearly and fully i nformed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other cri tical issues regardi ng clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given by [CONTACT_1766], their l egally acceptable representatives
(as per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed abou t the purpose, po tential risks, and 
other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the s ubject volunteers to participate. 
Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an approp riate (i.e., Global or Local) sample 
informed consent form w hich will include all elements required by [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

During this period, approximately 150 subjects w ill be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two 
parallel arms in a double-blinded manner as follows (see Table 5.1-2 ):
Arm A : Active abatacept SC (125 mg) weekly + standard treatment
Arm B: Placebo abatacept SC weekly + standard treatment
At the time of randomization, subjects must be on a stable back ground treatment (“standard 
treatment” see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) for IIM. No adjustment in background tr eatment w ill be allowed 
during this Period. Rando mization will be s tratified globally by 3 stratification variab les: 
(1) Dermatomyositis (DM) vs non-DM IIM, and (2) presence or abse nce of interstitial lung disease 
(ILD), (3) Japan vs Rest of World (ROW). 
Rescue therapy will be available for subjects who meet the dise ase worsening criteria during the 
double-blind period as defined in  Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_137372] clinically active or relevant interstitial l ung disease (ILD) 
or anti-synthetase s yndrome as determined by [CONTACT_093] m ust undergo pulmonary function 
testing and high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the chest during screening (prior to Day 1) and 
may have repeat pulmonary function testing (PFT) and HRCT scan at  Wk 24. (See  Section 5.3.6
and Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
Subjects who participate in the sub-study of MRI muscle (thighs)  imaging will have an MRI 
performed during screening (prior to Day 1) and Wk 24. See Section 5.8.[ADDRESS_137373] a muscle biopsy performed 
during screening (prior to Day 1) and Wk 24. See Section 5.8.3
Subjects who discontinue treatment with study medication during  the Double-blind Period will 
complete the Early Termination visit (which is the same visit a s Day 169 visit) (See Table 5.1-2). 
These subjects must also return on the previously scheduled Dou ble-blind Period Day [ADDRESS_137374]-Study Drug Efficacy Visit (see Table 5.1-4 ). The purpose of this visit is to assess 
all aspects of disease activity to ascertain the impact of stud y participation for regulatory review. 
Subjects must also complete 2 follow- up visits ([ADDRESS_137375] dose) during the [ADDRESS_137376]-treatment follow-up period, to perform safety and lab oratory assessments (See  Table  
5.1-[ADDRESS_137377]-Treatment Follow-Up Period). This Period begins on the day  of the Early Termination 
visit and applies only to subjects who do not start commercial abatacept therapy.

Period (Week 52 - Week 76) for Japan
The 24-week Double-Blind Period is followed by a 28 week open-l abel abatacept treatment period 
(Open-Label Period, see Table 5.1-3 ). During this period, subjects initially randomized to receive  
Revised Protocol No.: 04
Date: 01-Feb-[ADDRESS_137378] treatment plus 
abatacept.
There will also be a 24 weeks (168 days) open label extension f or subjects randomized in Japan.
Background treatment may be adjusted (including the dose of cor ticosteroids and 
immunosuppressants) at any time during this period. Use of immu ne globulin (intravenous [IVIG] 
or subcutaneous [SCIG] is permitted during this peri od. Addition of a ny other prohibited 
medication ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) is not permitted.
During this period, subjects who have clinically active or relevant interstitial l ung disease (ILD) 
or anti-synthetase syndrome as determined by [CONTACT_093], may have to repeat pulmonary 
function testing and HRCT scan of the chest at Wk 52. (See Section 5.3.6 and Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] ) and 
at Wk 76 for Japan.
Subjects who participate in the sub-study of MRI muscle (thigh) imaging will have an MRI 
performed at Wk 52. See  Section 5.8.2
Subjects who discont inue treatment with  abatacept during the Op en-Label Period or Open Label

study. The following is a list of some common conditions that m ay preclude the subject from 
having MRI of the hands or wrists. However, this should not be used as a substitute for local 
clinical standards of care. The ult imate decision to perform an  MRI on an individual subject in 
the MRI sub-study rests with the site radiologist, the investig ator, and the standard set by [CONTACT_122375]:
a) Subjects who have a history of claustrophobia.
b) Subjects who have a physical limitation related to fitting in  the bore of the magnet (ie, body 
weight in excess of 250 pounds or 113.4 kilograms).
c) Subjects with tattoos on the area to be imaged.d) Subjects who have a history of allergic reaction to contrast agents

4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity o f this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subj ect in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is cri tical to the subject's management , the blind for that subject may be 
broken by [CONTACT_093]. The subject’s safety takes priority  over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject's treatment,  the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, ie, that it w ill alter the  subject's immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is c learly not related to the 
investigation al product, the problem may be properly managed by  [CONTACT_82745]. It is highly desirable that the decis ion to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed with the Medical Monitor, but the i nvestigator alw ays has ultimate authority for the 
decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_122345] l in for emergency unblinding 
AFTER the decision to discontinue the subject has been made.
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes  is the Central Randomization 
System (IVRS).
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_122382].
Any request to unblind a subject for non-emergency purposes sho uld be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.

5.3.6 Pulmonary Function Testing
To assess the safety and efficacy of abatacept in IIM subjects with interstitial lung disease (ILD), 
pulmonary function testing including FEV1, FVC, and DLCO will b e performed on all sub jects 
who have clinically active or relevant Interstitial Lung Diseas e (ILD) or anti-synthetase syndrome 
at baseline (define in [IP_ADDRESS] ). Testing will be obtained at baseline (prior to Day 1), Week 24, Week 
52 and Week 76 (or early termination) for subjects with ILD. PFT  will be pe rformed and read 
locally and reviewed by [CONTACT_122394] d ecision maki ng. No central clinical report w ill be 
generated for return to the site.

[IP_ADDRESS] X-ray Assessment
A posterior-anterior and lateral chest X-ray, performed during screening, is required for all subjects 
unless performed within [ADDRESS_137425] ed on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
This assessment will not be evaluated by a central lab.
[IP_ADDRESS] High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) Chest
HRCT of the chest will be ob tained to evaluate the extent of  lung fibrosis at bas eline (prior to 
Day 1) for subjects who are identified by [CONTACT_122395] (ILD) or anti-synthetase s yndrome at baseline (defined as the presence 
of anti-synthetase autoantibody and at least 2 of the following : ILD, inflammatory myositis or 
inflammatory polyarthritis).
Subjects with clinically active or relevant ILD will be defined  as those who have: 
1) clinical symptoms of ILD at baseline and/or during the study,  or
2) worsening ILD, at baseline and/or during the study, as per th e treating physician assessment 
necessitating a treatment change (with documented worsening of at least 2 the following 
parameters: patient’s report of worsening dyspnea, worsening in  severity of ground glass 
opacities (GGO), reticulation or honeycombing or fibrosis on ch est HRCT or a decline in the 
FVC% > 10%) within last 6 months, or
3) new onset of ILD (within 3 months of study entry), or
4) a clinically relevant decrease in lung function on Pulmonary Function Testing (at the discretion 
of the investigator)
Subjects with ILD who are evaluated with a HRCT at baseline wil l also have repeat HRCT 
performed at Weeks 24, 52, and 76 (or early termination).
Revised Protocol No.: 04
Date: 01-Feb-[ADDRESS_137426] has been applied in multiple clinical studies of lung fibr osis for drug development, serving 
as an inclusion criterion, a predictive marker of positive trea tment response, and/or efficacy 
readout. A computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) score to quantify lung fibrosis as the percentage 
involvement of reticulation patterns based on texture measures from HRCT has been developed 
and validated as a measure of qua ntitative lung fibrosis (QLF) a nd a potential surrogate imaging 
marker. CAD scores of QLF have been successfully applied as out come measurements to test 
treatment eff icacy in ILD trials. Compared with visual assessme nts, CAD scores have been shown 
to improve objectivity, sensitivity, and repeatability when mea suring quantitative changes in lung 
features.

5.4.1 Clinical Assessments for the Study
[IP_ADDRESS] IMACS Definition of Improvement (DOI)
The IMACS DOI is:
•An improvement of ≥20% from baseline in 3 IMACS core measures, AND
•No more than 2 IMACS core measure scores worsen by ≥25% from bas eline, AND
•Manual Muscle Test (MMT-8) may not decrease by ≥25% from baseline
IMACS core measures are:
•Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA)
•Patient (Subject) Global Assess ment of Disease Activity (SGA)
•Manual Muscle Test (MMT-8)
•Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)
•Muscle Enzyme levels
•Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool (MDAAT) Extramuscular  Global Activity 
The muscle enzymes of interest are creatine kinase (CK), aldolase , AST, ALT, and LDH. To assess 
the DOI the most abnormal lab v alue (% above ULN) at baseline w ill be d etermined. The 
subsequent change from baseline for this lab value will be used  to determine if the patient has met 
the DOI at each time point indicated ( Table 5.1-2 , Table 5.1-3 ,a n d  Table 5.1-5 ).
To assess the criteria for worsening, the change from baseline will be determined for all 5 lab 
values at each time-point ind icated (Table 5.1-2, Table 5.1-3. an d Table 5.1-5). The lab value with 
Revised Protocol No.: 04
Date: 01-Feb-[ADDRESS_137427] percent increase from baseline for each will be use d to determine if the patient has met 
the criteria for worsening respectively ( Section 3.1.5 ).
Descriptions of the other core measures are below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessments Performed by [CONTACT_122396]-investigator performing this assessment  should have appropriate medical 
credentials and/or should be individuals with appropriate scien tific/medical background who are 
experienced in performing myositis disease activity assessments . The sub-investigator preferably 
should be a qualified physician or Doctor of Medicine (MD). Whe re permitted by [CONTACT_122397], a qualified Doctor of Osteopathy (DO), Physicia n Assistant (PA), or Nurse 
Practitioner (NP) may perform the Physicians Global Assessment if they have substantial 
experience assessing patients wit h IIM. All other non-PGA asses sments may be performed by 
[CONTACT_122398] (eg, RN or physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) and are trained to perform the specif ic IIM study as sessments. All individuals that 
perform study assessments must be  recorded in the  study file al ong with their educational 
background, work experien ce and training.
Physicians Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA)
This tool measures the global evaluation by [CONTACT_122399] a [ADDRESS_137428] (MMT-8)
This tool assesses muscle strength using a 0 - 10 point scale. A  set of 7 designated muscles is tested 
bilaterally plus axial (neck flexor) testing, so that the poten tial MMT-8 sc ore ranges from 0 - 150. 
The designated muscles tested will be:
•Neck flexors
•Deltoid middle
•Biceps brachii
•Gluteus maximus
•Gluteus medius
•Quadriceps
•Wrist extensors
•Ankle dorsiflexors
Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool (MDAAT)
This is a combined tool that captures the physician’s assessmen t of disease activity of various 
organ systems usi ng (1) a 0-4 s cale and (2) a visual analog scale (VAS). It assesses the clinical 
features of each organ system based upon:

Clinical Protocol IM101611
BMS-188667 abatacept
a) The presence of clinical feature s or symptoms within the prev ious 4 weeks that are due to 
active disease (i.e., use your clinical judgment to determine h ow active the myositis-
associated clinical feature has been within the previous 4 week s)
b) The judgment that the feature is due to the myositis disease p rocess (ie, clinical findings 
known or suspected to be due to another disease process or due to therapy should NOT be 
considered in this evaluation)
c) The concept that disease activity is defined as a potentially  reversible finding
d) A clinical, functional, and laboratory assessment for each or gan system
The scoring system is based primarily on the physician’s intent ion to treat (Categories A – E). In 
some cases, a patient may meet the clinical manifestations of a  particularly category, but the 
treatment does not match the intention to treat of that particu lar category; in those cases, the 
category matching the clinical symptoms should be marked. If mo re than one clinical symptom is 
present within a system, and different categories would be scor ed for each, mark the category that 
is most severe. 
Myositis Function Index (FI-2)
The FI-2 is a functional outcome developed for patients with ad ult polymyositis or 
dermatomyositis assessing muscle endurance in sev en mus cle grou ps. Each muscle group is scored 
as the number of correctly performed repetitions with 60 or 120  maximal number of repetitions 
depending on muscle group. The FI-2 is a furthe r development of the original Functi onal Index 
(FI) and has been validated as to content and construct validity  and intra- and inter-rater reliability. 
The FI-[ADDRESS_137429]

Myositis Damage Index (MDI)
This tool measures the degree of disease damage of all organ sy stems. It is composed of a series 
of organ-specific questions relating to the presence or absence  of a given sign or symptom or 
problem to measure the extent of damage, and an overall rating of the dise ase damage of each 
system using a 10 cm. visual analogue scale to measure the seve rity of damage 
Myositis Response Criteria (MRC)68
This Myositis Response Criteria (MRC) algorithm generates a con tinuous total improvement score 
(range 0-100) based on the sum of the absolute % change in the 6  core domains (weighted) used 
in the IMACS DOI. It also defines cut points for minimal ( ≥20 point increase), moderate ( ≥40 
points), and major ( ≥60 points) improvement in disease.
Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDAS I)
This tool assesses the improvement in skin disease activity in subjects with dermatomyositis. Four 
domains are evaluated including 1) disease activity and damage in 15 anatomic locations, 
2) presence of Gottron’s papules on the hands, 3) periungual cha nges, and 4) alopecia. A total 
activity score a nd damage score are calculated.

[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete the Patient Global Assessment of Disease  Activity, HAQ-DI, PROMIS 
Fatigue, and SF-36 in the ePRO device. All of these patient rep orted outcomes should be 
performed prior to all other assessments.
Patient (Subject) Global Assess ment of Disease Activity (SGA)
This tool measures the global evaluation by [CONTACT_122400] r overall disease activity at the time 
of assessment using a 10 cm visual analogue scale.Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ/HAQ-DI)
Scoring conventions are based on the Standard Disability Index of HAQ/HAQ-DI, using the 
[ADDRESS_137430]’s u se of aids, devices, or assistance 
in the scoring algorithm for a disability category. For each of  the 8 disability categories there is an 
“aids/devices” companion variable that is used to record the ty pe of assistance, if any, a subject 
uses for his/her usual activities. If either “aids/devices” and/ or “assistance from another person” 
are checked for a disability  category, the sco re for t his categ ory is set to “2” (much difficulty), if 
the original score was “0” (no difficulty) or “1” (some difficu lty). The HAQ-DI is then calculated 
by [CONTACT_122401] n umber of categories answered. 
Details of the HAQ-DI scoring conventions are documented in Fries et al69and Ramey et al70. 
The HAQ is based on a scale of 0-3. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMI S) - SF Fatigue v1.0 Adult 
Form 8a 
The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (P ROMIS) Fatigue Short Form 
8a will be used to capture fatigue. The PROMIS project was established as part of the National 
Institutes of Health Roadmap Initiative to create item banks wh ich are publically available, 
efficient, precise, and valid across a variety of diseases to a ssess PROs (www.nihpromis.org).
The PROMIS Fatigue instrument evaluates a range of self-re ported symptoms, from mild 
subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitati ng, and sustained sense of exhaustion 
that likely decreases one’s ability to execute daily activities  and function normally in fa mily or 
social roles. Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue  (frequency , durati on, and intensity) 
and the impact of fatigue on physical, mental, and social activ ities.
In this study, the static form of eight questions will be used.  The Fatigue short form is universal 
rather than disease-specific. It assesses fatigue over the past  seven days.

medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic  or nonpathogenic) via the study 
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be ha ndled as SAEs. ( See S ection 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (e .g., d eath is an 
endpoint, if death o ccurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis mus t be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for repor ting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122347] c onsidered SAEs in BMS cli nical studies: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result in 
admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threa tening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
•routine health assessment requiri ng admission for baseline/trend ing of health status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth a nd planned prior to entry into the 
study. Appropriate documentati on is required i n these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health s tatus 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, ec onomic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)
•Admission for administration of  anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Section 5.5.1 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Ref erence Safety Information to 
determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. Following the subject’s 
written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, 
must be collected, including thos e thought to be  associated wit h protocol-specified procedures. All 
SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period t hrough [ADDRESS_137431] s regarding its seriousness.

If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study treatment, and Pr egnancies must be reported to BMS 
(or designee) immediately within [ADDRESS_137432] be recorded on the SAE Report Form. The required method for SAE data reporting is 
through the eCRF. The paper SAE Report Form is only intended as  a back-up option when the 
electronic d ata capture (EDC) system is unavailable /not functioning for tr ansmission of the eCRF 
to BMS (or designee). In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission. When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site. 
Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pregnancy Surveillance Form and transmitted via email 
or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission.
 
If only limited information is i nitially available, follow-up r eports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if n ew information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submi tted within [ADDRESS_137433] be followed to resolution or stabilization.
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorities and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC a nd FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 a nd 320. A S[LOCATION_003]R (Suspected, Unexp ected Serious Adverse 
Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and 
investigators following local and global guidelines and require ments.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
A sample size of 150 subjects (75 subjects per treatment group) is planned based on the pr imary 
comparison of the proportion of subjects with IMACS DOI (as def ined under the primary 
objective) at Day 169 (Week 24) between the SC abatacept group and the placebo group on a 
background of standard treatment.
A sample size of 150 subjects ra ndomized in a 1:1 ratio to the SC abatacept group and placebo 
group will yield a power of approximately 90% to detect a treat ment difference of 27% in the rate 
of IMACS DOI between the [ADDRESS_137440]. 
This power estimate assumes a two-sided alpha level of 5%, IMAC S DOI rate of 60% in the 
abatacept group and 33% in the placebo group.
The 60% estimate of IMACS DOI in the abatacept group was based on reported rates of IMACS 
DOI in studies of patients with Myositis on combination therapy  with another biologic agent36. It 
is expected that the rate of IMACS DOI on abatacept in combinat ion with standard treatment 
should be similar to that observed with the use of another biol ogic agent in combination with 
standard treatment. Table 8.1-1 b elow presents the power estimates for other considerations of 
proportion of subjects in IMAC DOI in the abatacept group assum ing the total sample size of 
150 subjects. Rando mization will be s tratified globally by 3 str atification variables: (1) disease 
diagnosis (Dermatomyositis [DM] vs non-DM IIM), (2) Interstitial  Lung Disease (ILD) (present 
vs absent), (3) Japan vs ROW.

The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Population is defined to inc lude all subjects randomized 
into the study for whom Case Report Form (CRF) data indicate th at at least one dose of study 
medication (abatacept or placebo) is administered during the Do uble-Blind Period. 
All subjects who are randomized but never received study medica tion are to be excluded. 
Given the blinded nature of this study, it is reasonable to ass ume that subjects who discontinue 
prior to the receipt of study m edication do so for reasons unre lated to st udy med ication. 
Subjects are grouped according to the treatments to which they are randomized by [CONTACT_54537]. 
ITT Analysis Population is also referred to as ‘All Randomized and Treated Subjects’. 
•As-Treated Analysis Population
The As-Treated Analysis Population con tain all subjects for whom CRF data indicate that at 
least one dose of study medication was administered during Doub le-Blind Period. 
Subjects are grouped according to th e treatments to which they are randomized, except in cases 
where information are available, which indicate that a subject receives a different tr eatment for 
the entire course of Double-Blind Period. In this case, the sub ject w ill be presented by [CONTACT_122402]. 
The As-Treated Analysis Population will also be referred as ‘Al l Treated Subjects’.
•Per-Protocol Analysis Population
The Per-protocol Analy sis Population is defined as a subset of the ITT Analysis Population 
which excludes subjects who have relevant protocol deviations d uring the double-blind study 
period. Relevant protocol deviations are those protocol deviati ons that might affect the primary 
efficacy endpoint of the study. A programmable list of relevant  protocol deviations will be 
included in the Statistical Analysis Plan and approved prior to  the Double-Blind Period 
database lock.
The Per-protocol Analysis P opulation w ill only be used if more than 10% of the subjects in 
either treatment group have relevant protocol deviations. In su ch a case, the analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be repeated in the Per-protocol Analysis Population.
 
 
•Open-label Abatacept Treated Population 
The open-label abatacept treated population will contain all su bjects for whom CRF data 
indicate that at least one dose of study medication was adminis tered during the Open-Label 
Period. All Week 52 analyses will be performed using this popul ation.

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete AbstinenceComplete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heteros exual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. 
This also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual life style of the 
patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar , ovulation, 
symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinic al trial, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptabl e 
methods of contraception. Women must continue to have pregnancy  tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly or less effective contra ception’s 
must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to fore go complete 
abstinence.

Date: 01-Feb-[ADDRESS_137454] agree to use one highly effective m ethod of contraception as listed 
below:
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate o f < 1% when used consistently and 
correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to use 
one of the highly effective methods of contraception listed bel ow. Male subjects must inform their 
female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requirements  of the protocol and are 
expected to adhere to using contraception with their partner. C ontraception methods are as follows:
1. Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhib ition of ovulation.
2. Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptiv e pi[INVESTIGATOR_122351] + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants an d intrauterine devices (IUDs) 
such as MirenaÒ
3. Nonhormonal IUDs, s uch as ParaGardÒ 
4. Bilateral tubal occlusion5. Vasectomised partner with documented azoospermia 90 days afte r procedure
•Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method  provided that partner is the 
sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the  vasectomised partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success.
6. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).7. Complete abstinence
•Complete abstinence is defined as the complete avoidance of het erosexual intercourse 
(refer to Glossary of Terms)
•Complete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study d rugs and must 
be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus 5 half-lives of the 
investigational drug plus 30 days).
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception wh en complete abstinence is 
elected.
•Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have p regnancy tests as 
specified in Section 5. 1.
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
•The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in r elation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the sub ject.
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or  additional contraception methods.

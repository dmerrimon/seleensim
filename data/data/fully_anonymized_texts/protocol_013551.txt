Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 1.0 Background 
1.1 Multiple Myeloma:  Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy arising from post 
germinal center, terminally differentiated plasma cells, characterized by [CONTACT_740200], resulting in elevated levels of monoclonal 
immunoglobulins (Ig) in the serum and/or urine.  Common clinical sequelae include lytic bone 
lesions, fractures, myelosuppression, and renal failure. In the [LOCATION_002] of America 
([LOCATION_003]), the estimated annual diagnosed inci dence is 22,350, with approximately 100,000 
prevalent cases.(Siegel, Naishadham et al. 2013)  In Europe, the estimated annual diagnosed 
incidence is 21,611 with approximately 54 ,536 prevalent cases.(1998) Multiple myeloma 
accounts for 10% of all hematologic malignanci es and 1% of all malignancies. Advances in 
high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transpla ntation have improved overall survival and 
event-free disease periods in patients with MM, but relapses are inevitable.(Kumar, Lee et al. 2012, Kumar, Dispenzieri et al. 2013) New therapeutic agents, such as bortezomib and 
thalidomide analogues, have shown promising clin ical benefit in patients with relapsed or 
refractory disease. Current treatments include combination chemotherapy with regimens using melphalan (Alkeran
®), bortezomib (Velcade®), thalidomide (Thalomid®), and 
lenalidomide (Revlimid®) with and without corticosteroids.(Mikhael, Dingli et al. 2013) 
Younger patients are consolidated with hi gh-dose therapy (ablative chemotherapy or 
radiation) with autologous stem cell transp lantation (ASCT). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_740168], MM remains essentially incurable a nd is associated with high morbidity and 
mortality.(Palumbo, Bringhen et al. 2006) Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous 
disease with diverse outcomes dictated in large part by [CONTACT_740201]. Genetic abnormalities are seen in the plasma cells in nearly all patients with 
myeloma, especially when assessed with inte rphase FISH.(Avet-Loiseau, Attal et al. 2007, 
Fonseca, Bergsagel et al. 2009) The abnormalities broadly consist of translocations involving 
the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 or trisomies of one or more odd numbered chromosomes, or a combination of the two.(Kumar, Fonseca et al. 2012) Presence of certain genetic abnormalities are associat ed with a dismal outcome; abnormalities that 
denote high-risk myeloma. Among these, presence of p53 abnormality in particular is associated with a poor survival, with median overall survival of 3 years or less.(Lopez-Anglada, Gutierrez et al. 2010, Kumar, Fonseca et al. 2012) These patients respond well to 
initial therapy, but rapi[INVESTIGATOR_740169]. Studies 
have suggested that myeloma cells are genomically unstable, and loss of p53 may signal 
heightened instability. Given the poor outcome seen in these patients even with the most 
effective regimens, it is imperative we d esign new approaches to treat these patients. 
 
1.2 17p deletion in multiple myeloma:
 Survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has 
nearly doubled in the previous decade, but n early a quarter of patients have an aggressive 
course with median survival of less than 3 years.(Kumar, Rajkumar et al. 2008) Genetic abnormalities are the major determinants of outco me in myeloma and can be broadly grouped 
into trisomies, translocations involving heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, and monosomies or deletions involving various ch romosomes(Avet-Loiseau, Attal et al. 2007, 
Kumar, Mikhael et al. 2009, Kumar, Fonseca et al. 2012) Trisomies typi[INVESTIGATOR_740170].(Chng, Van Wier et al. 2005) There are five recurrent translocations that can  affect the IgH locus resulting in activation of 
different oncogenes. Among these t(4;14), t(14;16) and t(14;20) are associated with shortened 
survival.(Bergsagel and Kuehl 2005) Finally, partial deletions or monosomies affecting 
chromosomes 1, 13, 14, [ADDRESS_1011446] been repor ted. In particular, loss of the short arm of 
chromosome (17p-) or its monosomy results in loss of the TP53  gene.(Chng, Price-Troska et 
al. 2007) This abnormality is seen in approximate ly 10% of patients at diagnosis and 10-15% 
MC1582 6 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 of patients at relapse and results in short response duration to therapy, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_740171] 2-3 years 
after diagnosis.(Neri, Baldini et al. 1993, Dr ach, Ackermann et al. 1998, Avet-Loiseau, Li et 
al. 1999, Chang, Qi et al. 2005, Gertz, Lacy et al. 2005, Chng, Price-Troska et al. 2007, 
Tiedemann, Gonzalez-Paz et al. 2008, Xiong,  Wu et al. 2008) Abnormalities of the TP53  
gene have been associated with poor outcome  in almost all cancers studied, including 
hematological cancers and solid tumors. The TP53  gene is often referred to as the ‘guardian 
of the genome’, given its crucial role in induc tion of apoptosis in cells in the presence of 
DNA damage. Following DNA damage, TP53  regulates key processes, including DNA 
repair, cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis. This serves to suppress replication and propagation of the cells with the damaged DNA, thus reducing the risk of cancer. In the absence of normal TP53  function, many cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_740172]. In the ma jority of tumors, loss of 
TP53  function is a result of a mutated TP53  gene. In sharp contrast, TP53  abnormalities in 
MM appear to be related primarily to loss of  the gene through an interstitial deletion or 
monosomy of chromosome 17.(Chng, Price-Troska et al. 2007, Xiong, Wu et al. 2008) The lack of mutations involving the TP53 gene in MM, unlike other cancers, opens up new therapeutic potential in terms of modulation of TP53 gene function. In normal cells, p53 
levels are regulated by [CONTACT_530530]2, a RING domain protein, through a negative feedback loop. 
When nuclear p53 levels are elevated, transcrip tion of the MDM2 gene occurs leading to 
increased cellular levels of mdm2 protein, which in turn binds to p53 and blocks its 
transactivation domain. MDM2 also has a p53- specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that leads 
to ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. Th erefore, blocking the p53-MDM2 interaction 
can enhance levels of p53 in the presence of a functional p53 gene and particularly in the 
setting of myeloma, may be able to compensate for the loss of one of the alleles. Pre-clinical studies with nutlin-class drugs have demonstrated  potent in vitro activit y for this mechanism 
in myeloma. (Stuhmer, Chatterjee et al. 2005, Stuhmer and Bargou 2006, Saha, Jiang et al. 
2010, Saha, Jiang et al. 2010)
 
 
1.3 Proteasome inhibitors and 17p deletion : Bortezomib as part of induction as well as 
maintenance therapy has been  associated with improved outcomes in patients with TP53  
deletion. In a series of 354 MM patients treated within the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, Neben et al analyzed the effect of a bortezomib-based treatment before and after autologous stem cell transplantation compared with standa rd treatment without bortezomib. Patients with 
del(17p13) had a significant benefit with the bortezomib-containing treatment: the median PFS was 12.0 months without bortezomib compared to 26.2 months (P = .024) with bortezomib; the 3 year-OS was 17% and 69%, respectively (P = .028).
 
 
1.4 Ixazomib : MLN9708, which has been formulated for both intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) 
administration, is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor. It is the citrate ester of the biologically active boronic acid form, MLN2238. In water or aqueous systems, MLN9708 rapi[INVESTIGATOR_78932]2238, therefore a ll doses and concentrations are expressed as 
MLN2238. Nonclinical studies were conducted with a solution of either MLN2238 or 
MLN2238 in equilibrium with MLN9708. Similar to bortezomib, MLN2238 potently, 
reversibly, and selectively inhib its the 20S proteasome. However, in contrast to bortezomib, it 
has a shorter dissociation half-life (t1/2) that may contribute to increased tissue distribution. Bortezomib has a slowly reversible dissociation rate from the red blood cell proteasome, while MLN2238 demonstrates a more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_478554] r proteasomes suggesting better tissue 
distribution. The pharmacologic implications of this difference in binding kinetics and tissue distribution may in turn result in differences in safety and efficacy profiles in a broader range 
MC1582 7 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 of tumors. In xenograft-bearing mice, the more  rapid dissociation rate correlates with an 
increased ratio of tumor proteasome inhibition to blood proteasome inhibition, and ixazomib 
shows greater antitumor activity in several  xenograft models, both solid tumor and 
bortezomib-resistant xenografts, than bortezomib. 
 
Please refer to the latest version of the Ixazomib IB for further details. 
 Nonclinical Pharmacology : MLN2238 refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form of 
the drug substance, ixazomib citrate (MLN9708). Ixazomib citrate refers to the citrate ester of 
MLN2238. In water or aqueous systems, the equilibrium shifts from ixazomib to the 
biologically active boronic acid form MLN2238.  All doses and concentrations are expressed 
as the boronic acid, MLN2238. 
 In Vitro Pharmacology : MLN2238 preferentially binds the β5 site of the 20S proteasome; at 
higher concentrations, it also inhibits the activity of the β1 and β2 sites. MLN2238 inhibits ß5 
site 20S proteasome activity in vitro, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 
3.4 nM. Potency is reduced roughly 10-fold ve rsus ß1 (IC50=31 nM) and 1,000-fold versus 
ß2 (IC50 =3500 nM). MLN2238 was also tested for inhibition against a panel of 103 kinases, 18 receptors (neurotransmitter, ion channel, brain and gut receptors), and 9 serine proteases. 
In all cases, the IC50 values were >[ADDRESS_1011447] different β5 
proteasome dissociation half-lives (t1/2), reflecting differences in their on-off binding 
kinetics (the β 5 proteasome dissociation t1/2 for MLN2238 and bortezomib are 18 and 110 
minutes, respectively). Based on these favorable ch aracteristics, ixazomib is anticipated to be 
effective against multiple myeloma (Ixazomib Investigator’s Brochure (IB)). Proteasome inhibition results in the accumulation of poly- ubiquitinated substrat es within the cell and 
leads to cell cycle disruption, with concomita nt activation of apoptotic pathways and cell 
death. Consistent with inhibition of ß5 20S activity, MLN2238 demonstrated potent activity against cultured MDA-MB [ADDRESS_1011448] cell viability assay. In 
nonclinical models MLN2238 has activity agains t both solid tumor and bortezomib-resistant 
xenografts. 
 
In Vivo Pharmacology : To determine the activity of MLN2238 in vivo, pharmacodynamic 
studies were performed in immunocompromised mice bearing either CWR22 human prostate or WSU-DLCL2 (human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]) tumors. Pharmacodynamic responses in xenograft tumors  were analyzed by [CONTACT_58833] 20S proteasome 
inhibition and by [CONTACT_478587] (DNA) damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) and activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3) as well as measuring growth arrest. Increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3 is indicative of a downstream biological response to proteasome inhibition. After a single dose of MLN2238, a clear dose response was observe d in CWR22 xenografts as seen in both 
tumor 20S proteasome inhibition and in changes in GADD34 and ATF-3 expression. In 
WSU-DLCL2 xenografts, greater tumor proteasome inhibition was observed with MLN2238 
compared to bortezomib and resulted in increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3. MLN2238 efficacy experiments demonstrated strong antitumor activity in 4 xenograft models: CWR22 (a human prostate cancer cell line) and 3 human lymphoma cell lines 
(WSU-DLCL2, OCI-Ly7-7D1-luc, and PHTX-22L). In the case of the CWR22 xenograft model, significant antitumor activity was seen w ith both IV and PO dos ing, demonstrating 
that this molecule has antitumor activity when administered via different dosing routes. In all 
3 lymphoma lines, MLN2238 demonstrated stronge r antitumor activity than did bortezomib. 
In summary, MLN2238, similar to bortezomib, is a dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor that potently, reversibly, and selectiv ely inhibits the proteasome. There are several 
MC1582 8 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 features, such as sustained pharmacodynamic effects and activity in a bortezomib-refractory 
lymphoma xenograft model, that suggest that it may have activity that extends beyond that seen with bortezomib.  
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics : Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics: The 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MLN2238 were studied in severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing human CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. B ecause of the extensive red blood cell (RBC) 
partitioning of MLN2238, both blood and plasma PK parameters were determined in these 
studies. MLN2238 had a very low blood clearance (CLb) and a moderate blood volume of 
distribution at steady-state (Vss,b) after IV administration. The concentration-versus-time curve of MLN2238 displayed a distinct bi-exponen tial profile with a steep initial distribution 
phase and a long terminal t
1/2 (>24 hr) in all species tested. MLN2238 had higher plasma 
clearance (CLp) and a larger plasma volume of  distribution at steady-state (Vss,p) than in 
blood, largely because of the extensive RBC partitioning. The PK properties of MLN2238 after oral administration were studied in rats  and dogs. The plasma oral bioavailability (F) 
was 41% in rats and nearly 100% in dogs. A clinical prototype formulation of the ixazomib capsule demonstrated that MLN2238 had excellent oral F and an excellent absorption profile in dogs. In addition, interindividual variab ility, as measured by %CV, in Cmax and AUC
0-24hr 
after oral administration was low to moderate, similar to that after IV administration. The terminal t
1/[ADDRESS_1011449] very low CLb (0.0045 L/hr/kg) and a 
moderate Vss,b (0.79 L/kg) with a long terminal t
1/2 (>24 hours) in humans. The human 
efficacious IV dose of MLN2238 is predicted to be 2.0 mg/m2 (0.054 mg/kg) twice weekly. 
The human efficacious oral dose is predicted to be between 2 and 5 mg/m2 twice weekly, 
based on a predicted oral F of between 41% (as seen in rats) and 100% (as seen in dogs). The efficacious dose projection for once weekly oral wo uld be higher than twice weekly oral (data 
not provided).  
Metabolism appears to be a major route of elim ination for MLN2238 and urinary excretion of 
the parent drug was negligible (<5% of dose). In vitro in liver microsomes, the metabolism of 
MLN2238 was high in mice and low to moderate in all other species studied. MLN2238 is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_20550] P450 (CYP) isozymes and non-CYP enzymes and 
proteins. The rank order of relative biotransfo rmation activity of each of the 5 major human 
CYP isozymes in the in vivo studies was 3A4 (34.2%) >1A2 (30.7%) >2D6 (14.7%) >2C9 
(12.1%) >2C19 (negligible). 
 MLN2238 is neither an inhibitor of CYP is ozymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 (IC50 
>30μM, with an estimated inhibition dissociation constant [Ki] >15 μM), nor a time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (up to 30 μM). The potential for ixazomib treatment to 
produce DDIs via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low.  In a Caco-2 cell assay, MLN2238 showed medium permeability with a B-to-A/A-to-B permeability ratio of 2.9. MLN2238 may be a low- affinity substrate of para-glycoprotein (P-
gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) efflux pump transporters. MLN2238 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 (IC50 
>100 μM). Consequently, the potential for MLN2238 to cause DDIs with substrates or 
inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is low.  
MC1582 9 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 Ixazomib Safety Pharmacology : In exploratory safety pharmacology studies, MLN2238 was 
a weak inhibitor of the cloned cardiac potassium (K+) human ether à-go-go related gene 
(hERG) channel, with an IC50 of 59.6 μM, which exceeds, by [CONTACT_3450] 200-fold, the 
plasma Cmax (111 ng/mL [0.3 μM]) predicted to occur in humans at the optimally efficacious dose after IV administration.  In the GLP-compliant, 1-cycle, repeat-dose, PO  toxicology study in beagle dogs, an increase 
in QTc was seen in male dogs at non-tolerated doses, and a potential increase in QTc was seen in male dogs at tolerated doses. However, increased QTc was not seen in female dogs at 
any dose, despi[INVESTIGATOR_478555] d plasma Cmax values similar to those of male 
dogs. Additionally, in a GLP-compliant, 2-cycle, repeat-dose, IV toxicology study in beagle 
dogs, no increase in QTc was seen in either male or female dogs at any dose, even though dogs in the IV study had higher MLN2238 plasma Cmax values than did the male dogs in the PO study. These data suggest that MLN2238 has a low potential for prolonging the QT 
interval in vivo . 
 Toxicology : All studies discussed in this section were  conducted with a solution of either 
MLN2238 or MLN2238 in equilibrium with ixazomib. Because ixazomib was shown to dissociate immediately to MLN2238 upon exposure to plasma in vitro and therefore could not 
be detected in plasma samples in vitro all doses, concentrations, and PK parameters noted, 
here and in the IB, are expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238. 
 The toxicology studies of MLN2238 were studied in SCID mice bearing human CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle  dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Details of 
these studies are included in the IB. 
 
In Vitro  Toxicology: MLN2238 was not mutagenic in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-
compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay).   In Vivo  Toxicology: Details of the in vivo  toxicology IV dosing and oral dosing studies are 
provided in the IB. To summarize, the toxicologi c effects seen in the IV and PO studies are 
qualitatively similar to what was previously observed in rodents dosed with bortezomib. MLN2238 did not cause significant toxicities that have not been previously observed after dosing with bortezomib. Therefore, on the basis of the similarity in the toxicity profile in rats 
between MLN22338 and bortezomib, MLN2238 is  not known to present any additional 
safety risks beyond those that occur after treatme nt with bortezomib. In addition, there were 
no significant findings at tolerated exposures in dogs observed after PO administration that were not seen after IV administration, and similar exposures were tolerated regardless of the route of administration.  The potential risks identified from nonclinical studies in dogs and rats include: 
• GI toxicity that could result in nausea, vo miting, diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte 
imbalance, bleeding, bowel obstruction (i ncluding ileus and intussusception), and 
sepsis. 
• Reduced blood counts manifest as throm bocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. 
Reticulocytopenia was described in animals and may be associated with anemia. Reductions in blood counts may predispose to an increased susceptibility to infection, 
bleeding, and anemia. 
• Peripheral nerve ganglia effects that may be associated with peripheral neuropathy that includes pain, burning sensation, and numbness. Autonomic and motor neuropathy may be observed, as both have been reported for bortezomib. 
MC1582 10 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 • Lymphoid cell depletion that may be associa ted with increased risk of infection, 
including re-activation of herpes zoster. 
• Acute phase response that may result in fever and metabolic changes. 
 
All of the effects seen in the GLP-compliant PO  toxicology studies in both dogs and rats at 
tolerated doses were reversible/reversing and can  be monitored in the clinic with routine 
clinical observations (GI disturbances and in fections secondary to lymphoid compromise), 
clinical pathology assessments (inhibition of  erythropoiesis, th rombocytopenia, and 
inflammatory leukogram), and neurologic assessment, as are commonly done for patients 
treated with bortezomib. The neurologic lesions in these studies are similar to what has been 
described after treatment with bortezomib and are believed to be the cause of the peripheral 
neuropathy observed in patients treated with bor tezomib. Further details are presented in the 
IB.  Clinical Experience with Ixazomib : Ixazomib is a small molecule peptide boronic acid. 
Ixazomib is the first investigational proteasome inhibitor with substantial oral bioavailability 
in patients with multiple myeloma.   Ixazomib has been evaluated as an oral single agent in phase [ADDRESS_1011450] included 
patients with advanced solid tumors, lym phoma, relapse/refractory MM (RRMM), and 
relapsed or refractory light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and demonstrated early signs of activity. 
Ongoing studies continue to investigate both single-agent ixazomib and ixazomib in 
combination with standard treatments. Based on encouraging preliminary data observed in 
patients with MM requiring systemic treatment,  two phase 3 trials in newly diagnosed MM 
(NDMM) (C16014) and RRMM (C16010) patient  populations are currently evaluating 
ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and dexamethasone (RevDex) 
versus placebo/RevDex. Both trials are combining ixazomib at a weekly dose of 4.[ADDRESS_1011451] of food, and oral 
bioavailability. Studies evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) of ixazomib alone (in Japanese patients) and in combination with le nalidomide and dexamethasone in Asian adult 
patients (including Japanese patients) with a diagnosis of NDMM are ongoing. 
 As of 27 March 2013, preliminary clinical data are available for a total of 653 patients across 
13 studies. The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well tolerated. The adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the class-based effects of proteasome inhibition 
and are similar to what has been previously reported with bortezomib though the severity of some, for example peripheral neuropathy, is l ess. While some of these potential toxicities 
may be severe, they can be managed by [CONTACT_480154], or, as needed, dose modification or discontinuation.  Fatigue was the most common AE reported among 384 patients treated in the oral (PO) 
studies (47%). Other common AEs reported in the pooled intravenous (IV) and PO safety 
populations include nausea, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and vomiting. Rash is also a 
commonly reported treatment-emergent event; however, there is some variety in its 
characterization and causality resulting in different preferred terms to describe it. A high-level term outline of rash events includes r ashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC; pruritus 
NEC; erythemas; papulosquamous conditions; and exfoliative conditions . The dose escalation 
phases of most trials reported in the IB have now completed enrollment, and gastrointestinal 
(GI) symptoms were the common dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when the use of 
MC1582 11 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 prophylactic anti-emetics was not permitted per pr otocol. In the expansion cohorts or phase 2 
cohorts (per each study), the incidence and sever ity of GI symptoms was mitigated by [CONTACT_740202] (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) (per each 
study) and standard clinical usage of anti-em etics and/or antidiarrheal medications as deemed 
appropriate. Prophylactic use of anti-emetics h as not been required as with other agents but 
has been used according to standa rd practice and are effective. 
 
The most frequent (at least 20%) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported with the PO formulation pooled from single-agent studies (n=201) irrespective of causality to 
ixazomib, include nausea (53%), fatigue (51% ), diarrhea (44%), thrombocytopenia (34%), 
vomiting (38%), decreased appetite (32%), fe ver (21%), and anemia (21%). The most 
frequent (at least 20%) TEAEs reported with the PO formulation pooled from combination 
trials (irrespective of the combination) (n=173) , irrespective of causality to ixazomib, include 
diarrhea (47%), fatigue (44%), nausea (38%), peripheral edema (35%),  constipation (33%), 
insomnia (29%), thrombocytopenia (28%), anemia (26%), vomiting (26%), neutropenia 
(25%), back pain (24%), pyrexia (23%), fe ver (20%), cough (20%), hypokalemia (20%), 
neutropenia (20%), and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_529244] (20%). Overall rash of all grades is 
reported in approximately 50% of patients and is more common when ixazomib is given in 
combination with lenalidomide, where rash is  an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171]. Additional detailed 
information regarding the clinical experience of ixazomib may be found in the IB, including information on the IV formulation.  Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism : Clinical IV and PO PK data show that ixazomib 
citrate (measured as the biologically active boronic acid form of ixazomib [MLN2238]) has multi-exponential disposition with a rapid initial phase that is largely over by [ADDRESS_1011452] time of occurrence of 
maximum (peak) concentration (Tmax) of appr oximately 0.5 to 2.0 hours and a terminal 
disposition half-life (t1/2) after multiple dosing of approximately 5 to 7 days. Results of a 
population PK analysis (n = 137) show that there is no relationship between body surface 
area (BSA) or body weight and clearance (CL) . Also, based on stochastic simulations for 
fixed dose, exposures are independent of the i ndividual patient’s BSA.(Gupta, Saleh et al. 
2011, Gupta, Saleh et al. 2012) Based on these data, a recommendation was made for fixed 
dosing in clinical trials. An absolute bioavailability of 67% was determined for ixazomib

Clinical Study C16009 (Arm 1) with ketocon azole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, showed a 2-
fold increase in area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) in the presence 
of ketoconazole. This resulted in the continue d exclusion of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in 
ongoing/planned clinical studies.  
Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral Formulation of Ixazomib : As of 27 March 2013, a 
total of 507 patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, 
nonhematologic cancers, and lymphoma) have been treated in studies evaluating the oral ixazomib formulation. These patients have been treated with different doses of ixazomib either as a single-agent treatment (in 201 patients)  or in combination with currently clinically 
available treatments (in 306 patients). Information regarding the ongoing studies, patient 
populations, and doses investigated is included in Table 1-1 .

1.5 Potential Risks of Ixazomib :  
The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well tolerated. The adverse 
events (AEs) are consistent with the class-b ased effects of proteasome inhibition and are 
similar to what has been previously reported  with bortezomib, though the severity of some, 
for example peripheral neuropathy, is less. While some of these potential toxicities may be 
severe, they can be managed by [CONTACT_480156], or, as 
needed, dose modification or discontinuation. In the four ongoing studies (C16003, C16004, 
C16007, and C16009) investigati ng single-agent oral ixazomib in patients with differing 
malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL am yloidosis, non-hematologic cancers, and 
lymphoma), a total of [ADDRESS_1011454] been  treated as of 27 March 2013. These patients

The clinical experience with ixazomib also shows early signs of antitumor activity as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_2669] a 50% reduction in disease burden in some patients and prolonged 
disease stabilization in others across all ongoing trials. The antitumor activity has been seen 
with single-agent ixazomib, when combined with establishe d therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and across the 
malignancies studied (advanced solid tumors, non-Hodgkin’s disease, Hodgkin’s disease, 
relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, relapsed or refractory systemic light chain amyloidosis, and newly diagnosed multiple myel oma) to date.(Kumar, Bensinger et al. 2014,

1.6 Idasanutlin (RO5503781) : Idasanutlin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 
interaction that activates the p53 pathway and in duces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in a 
variety of tumor types expressing wild-type p53 in  vitro and in vivo. It binds MDM2 in the 
p53 pocket with a high affinity (K
D=11 nM) leading to stabilization and accumulation of p53 
and consequent signaling. It blocks cell cycle progression in G1 and G2 leading to inhibition 
of cancer cell growth. It has a 30-fold selective toxicity for wild-type vs. mutant p53 cells. In 
a recent Phase [ADDRESS_1011464] established 
that the activity of idasanutlin may be potentiated when combined with rational therapeutic partners to improve efficacy, lending credence to such combinational regimens displaying 
synergistic anti-cancer effects. 
 
Non-clinical Pharmacology : The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of 
idasanutlin have been investigated in sever al nonclinical studies. In cell-free assays, 
idasanutlin binds to MDM2 protein with high affinity (dissociation constant [K
D] = 5.7 nM) 
and inhibits MDM2-p53 binding with drug concentration, which causes IC 50 of 6.6 ± 1.[ADDRESS_1011465]. As a result, 
cancer cells undergo a cell cycle block in the G1 and G2 phase followed by [CONTACT_20983]. In 
MC1582 18 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 vivo, idasanutlin has shown antitumor activit y at nontoxic doses against an established 
osteosarcoma xenograft model. These nonclinical pharmacology results support further 
evaluation of idasanutlin in clinical studies.  
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of 
idasanutlin were evaluated in mice, rats, dogs , and monkeys following intravenous (IV) and 
oral dosing. High exposures were achieved in a ll nonclinical species after oral administration 
and high oral bioavailability was observed in rodents (low in non-rodents). Multiple-dose 
pharmacokinetics of idasanutlin were studied duri ng general toxicology studies in Han Wistar 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys following oral dosing. Exposure increased with increasing dose level and no gender difference was appa rent. In rats, there was generally no 
accumulation or loss of exposure after multiple da ys of dosing. However, after repeat dosing 
of idasanutlin in monkeys, decreases in exposur e were apparent at all dose levels, which 
correlates to monkey-specific CYP3A induction in intestine and liver.  
 In vitro plasma protein binding was high (99.99%) and similar across species (mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human). Tissue distribution studies in rats showed that idasanutlin was widely distributed and the highest concentration was observed about [ADDRESS_1011466] dose in intestine, liver, adrenal gland, colon, cecum, kidney cortex, and gastric mucosa. Low 
metabolism occurred in rat, monkey, and human liver microsomal and hepatocyte 
incubations. Based on in vitro results, both ra ts and monkeys produced the same metabolites 
as humans, which supported the choice of these species for toxicological evaluation. In rats in vivo, [
14C]-idasanutlin and its related metabolites we re mainly excreted hepatically through 
bile with minimal renal elimination. Results  from in vivo metabolic profiles and metabolite 
identification of idasanutlin in human plasma and urine showed that 1) glucuronidation of 
idasanutlin seems to play a minor role in terms of human plasma exposure; 2) rat and cynomolgus monkey metabolic patterns together  cover the human plasma metabolite pattern; 
and 3) idasanutlin is not excreted through urine. 
 At therapeutic dose levels, idasanutlin has the potential for drug-drug interactions as a 
perpetrator with CYP2C8 substrates. Idasanu tlin is metabolized by [CONTACT_740203], mainly by [CONTACT_097]2C8, CYP3A4/5, a nd UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Strong 
inhibitors and/or inducers of these enzy mes may affect exposure of idasanutlin. 
 Toxicology and Safety Pharmacology 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_78078]-dose cycling studies in rats and monkeys that consisted of two dosing cycles of 
10 days duration with an intervening drug holiday of 18 days, followed by a recovery period, 
confirmed that idasanutlin produced target organ toxicity that was expected for a compound that disrupts the cell cycle. Safety findings identified in the toxicology studies at exposures that approximate the anticipated therapeutic range  are considered clinically manageable (e.g., 
diarrhea), monitorable (e.g., suppression of blo od cell components) and/or reversible (e.g., 
body and organ weight changes and diarrh ea). In the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
cycling studies, oral administration of ida sanutlin to rats and monkeys resulted in 
moribundity; diarrhea (monkeys only); decreased body weight and/or body weight gain (rats only); decreased food consumption; sporadic in creases in serum liver function tests (rats 
only); and target organ toxicities, including b one marrow hypocellularity, reduced leukocytes, 
erythrocytes, and/or platelets, decreased thymus or spleen weights, and lymphoid depletion in 
the thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and/or gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). 
Moribundity in monkeys occurred at doses ≥ 60 mg/kg/day. In rats, moribundity and 
premature death were noted at doses ≥ 500 mg/kg/day. In general, treatment-related findings 
either fully or partially reso lved during the recovery period. The maximum tolerated doses 
MC1582 19 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 (MTD) for two cycles of treatment with idasa nutlin were considered to be 30 and 300 
mg/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys and Wistar ra ts, respectively. No biologically relevant 
adverse effects were observed in the CNS or pulmonary system. Cardiovascular effects were 
limited to a reversible increase in heart rate in male monkeys at doses above the MTD. A 
GLP human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay conducted at physiological temperature 
showed an IC 20 of ≥  1.[ADDRESS_1011467] on the corrected QT interval (QTc) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_740173]. Based  on ultraviolet A (UVA)/ultraviolet B (UVB) 
absorption spectrum, idasanutlin demonstrates a potential for phototoxicity. Therefore, an in 
vivo phototoxicity study was conducted in Long Evans rats. Idasanutlin did not induce a 
phototoxic skin reaction at any dose, which indicated that there is little to no risk of 
phototoxicity in cancer patients.  RO0478485 (4-amino-3-methoxy-benzoic acid) is a potential impurity and degradation 
product of idasanutlin that is formed by [CONTACT_740204]. RO0478485 induced a 
weak but dose-related increase in the number of revertant colonies after metabolic activation. 
In order to reduce the amount of this impurity to levels as low as reasonably possible, adjustments to the drug substance and drug product process and different storage conditions are under evaluation.  CLINICAL INFORMATION 
Two Phase I clinical studies of idasanutlin are comp lete in patients with solid tumors (Studies

pharmacodynamic, and early response biomarkers and clinical efficacy at or below the MTD 
in preparation for Phase II clinical developmen t (results not yet available). In addition, 
evaluation of the effect of food on the pharma cokinetic (PK) parameters of idasanutlin was 
conducted in a subgroup of 10 patie nts enrolled in Study NP27872.  
Study NP28902 is a multicenter, open label, cro ssover design, clinical pharmacology study to 
investigate idasanutlin with drug-drug interacti on with posaconazole (Part 1, 20 patients) and

effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose with the optimized SDP formulation (Part 3, 29 patients, not included in the data cut-off) in  patients with solid tumors. A total of 61 
patients were enrolled and enrollment is closed. Twenty of the 61 patients continued into the

Nine of these twenty patients are included in the data cut-off.  Study NP28679 is a multicenter, open-label Ph ase I/Ib study of idasanutlin in escalating

from East Asian patients did not appear to differ from other patient ethnicities (mainly 
Caucasians). Age does not appear to have an im pact on PK exposure. A drug-drug interaction 
study with posaconazole as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor was conducted in 20 (18 evaluable) 
MC1582 22 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 patients with solid tumors. No change in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and 
modestly higher (32%) change in AUC were  found with CYP3A4 inhibition with minimal 
increase (22% in Cmax and 23% in AUC) with simulated steady −state profiles. Since a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor was chosen for the study, all CYP3A4 inhibition risks are deemed 
negligible.   Evaluable PK data are available for 12 patients in Part 2 (relative bioavailability) of Study 
NP28902 administered 400 mg reference MB P (micro-precipi[INVESTIGATOR_267471]), an 
improved 400 mg MBP, and a 400 mg SDP (spray -dried powder) formulations in randomized 
sequence on Days 1, 8, or 15 under fasting c onditions. Overall, preliminary clinical PK 
results indicate that: idasanutlin exposure, based on AUC to the last measurable time point (AUC168h) and Cmax, was higher with the SDP formulation (42% and 47%, respectively) 
than the previous (reference) MBP formulation.  The SDP will be the formulation in future 
trials including the current study. Part [ADDRESS_1011474] of a high 
energy/high-fat meal (1000 kcal with 50% from fat) and low-fat meal (500 kcal with 30% from fat) on PK. In 19 evaluable patients (receiving 3 crossover treatments) no evidence for a food-effect was demonstrated.Equivalence in all PK exposure parameters analyzed (90% confidence interval (CI)) was shown, while the low-fat meal demonstrated less than 20% increase in all PK exposure parameters, ju st outside the upper limit of 90% CI for 
bioequivalence. 
 
Clinical Pharmacodynamics 
Macrophage inhibitory cytokine ([MIC-1], a secreted protein that is strongly induced by 
[CONTACT_93247] p53) serum levels, has been used  to assess pharmacodynamic effects in Study 
NP27872. Analysis of patients treated with 100 to 3200 mg/day of idasanutlin showed that 
the minimum level for p53 induction occurred at the lowest tested dose of 100 mg/day or a 
corresponding plasma level of 500 ng/mL of idasanutlin. There was no upper limit with the dose tested. However, a comparison of MIC-1 elevation between the idasanutlin dosing schedules demonstrated poor ability to ac tivate p53 with the weekly schedule. 
 
Preliminary analysis of PK and safety data show ed that there is an apparent pharmacokinetic / 
pharmacodynamic relationship between an AUC pe r cycle and Cycle 1 platelet nadir; this 
was mostly associated with the daily (× 5 days or × 3 days) dosing schedules; no correlation 
exists for the weekly schedule. No correlation was apparent between idasanutlin plasma concentration and QT corrected using Frideric ia’s method (QTcF) for both solid tumor and 
AML patient populations, which suggests there was no apparent QT prolongation signal. 
 
Optimal Schedule 
Idasanutlin PK exposure, pharmacodynamic effect s (e.g., MIC-1, as a p53 activation marker), 
and target-mediated hematological changes (pla telet reduction in particular) were evaluated 
to support the optimal dosing schedule. A comparison of MIC-1 elevation between the idasanutlin dosing schedules demonstrated poor  ability to activate p53 with the weekly 
schedule. The daily × 3 days dose regimen did not achieve steady-state exposure, achieved a 
shorter period of SD, and did not alleviat e thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the daily × 5 days 
schedule is proposed as optimal for future clinical trials including the current study. 
 
Clinical Efficacy 
No relapsed solid tumor patients achieved a monotherapy response to idasanutlin, according 
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in Study NP27872. Twenty-six 
(31%) patients had stable disease and remained on study an average of [ADDRESS_1011475] showed significant changes

through MDM2 antagonism.  
 
Evaluable hematological malignancy respon se assessments from the NP28679 study were 
available for patients in Part 1, Part 1 EXT, Pa rt 2, Part 2 EXT and Part 4 arms at time of 
clinical data cutoff date 25 February 2015.  Response assessments were noted as follows:  
Part 1: Twenty (20) patients received monot herapy idasanutlin during Part 1 dose escalation 
at 400 mg (n = 2), 800 mg (n = 6) and 1600 mg (n = 12) daily x 5 days. Five (5) patients 
achieved marrow clearance on biopsy, Comple te Remission/Complete Remission without 
platelet recovery (CR/CRp) [n=2] or Complete Remission with insufficient recovery of 
peripheral counts (CRi)/Morphologic Leukemia Free State (MLFS) [n=3]. 
Part 1 Extension: Nine (9) patients received monotherapy idasanutlin at 600 mg two times per

Clinical Safety 
In solid tumor studies of idasanutlin, consistent  with the mechanism of action, p53 induction 
caused “on-target” toxicity in hematopoietic ce lls. Higher exposures led to adverse events of 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, which while reversible could reach grade 3/4 in some 
patients. Modeling of this toxicity demonstr ated that cytopenias were exposure dependent, 
with delayed nadirs in blood counts. Rec overy at higher exposures caused delays in 
subsequent cycles of therapy, which was alle viated by [CONTACT_2715]-reduction for subsequent cycles. 
• Most common AEs were diarrhea, na usea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and 
thrombocytopenia. 
• Most common severe AEs of NCI-CTC Grade 3 were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, 
anemia, nausea, and diarrhea. 
• Most common SAEs were thrombocytopen ia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, 
leukopenia, and anemia. 
• Seven (7) deaths occurred during the study, 5 due to progressive disease, and 2 due to 
fatal AEs (intra-abdominal hemo rrhage, pulmonary embolism) 
 
Overall, the current safety profile of Study NP [ZIP_CODE] in AML is consistent with findings from 
other studies of relapsed/refractory AML patient s treated with cytarabine. For those patients 
receiving cytarabine with idasanutlin, there is a similarity of the safety profiles for the two 
agents. Specifically, they both may manif est AEs for gastrointestinal disorders, 
myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia, infecti on including pneumonia, or cellulitis. When 
both agents are given concurrently, it may not be possible to distinguish whether the IMP or the disease, if not both, may have contributed to the onset of a given AE.  
At the data cutoff date of 14 February 2014 for Study NP28902 and with final data for Study 
NP27872, 131 patients with advanced malignanc ies (excluding leukemia) had received 
idasanutlin. In the Phase I entry-into-human  dose escalation study NP27872 there are 99 
patients with available data and the Phase I drug-drug interaction/relative bioavailability 
study NP28902 comprised [ADDRESS_1011479] all of which were related 
to hematopoietic or gastrointestinal toxiciti es. Of the 5 patients who reported an SAE in 
Study NP28902, only 1 patient experienced a serious adverse event of thrombocytopenia 
(Grade 4) considered by [CONTACT_41708]. A total of 18 
patients in Study NP27872 and 3 patients in Study NP28902 Part 1 
(idasanutlin+posaconazole) experienced adverse events that led to withdrawal from study treatment.  
The most frequently affected system organ classes (SOC; 10% of all patients) in Study 
NP27872 were gastrointestinal disorders (97/99 [98.0%]), general disorders and administration site conditions (74/99 [74.7%]), metabolism and nutrition disorders (63/99 [63.6%]), blood and lymphatic disorders (50/99 [50.5%]), nervous system disorders (48/99 [48.5%]), musculoskeletal and connective tissu e disorders (45/99 [45.5%]), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],

[19.2%]), psychiatric disorders and vascular disorders (13/99 [13.1% ] each), and injury, 
poisoning, and procedural complications (10/99 [10.1%]) ([CD]). A summary of the most 
frequent AEs occurring in at least 10% of the patients in any treatment group is shown in 
Table 1-6. The five most frequent AEs of a ny grade were diarrhea (74/99 [74.7%]), nausea 
(71/99 [71.7%]), vomiting (51/99 [51.5%]), decreased appetite ( 47/99 [47.5%]), and 
thrombocytopenia (39/99 [39.4%]).  
Overall, two deaths in Study NP28902 and seven deaths in Study NP27872 were reported. In 
Study NP27872, five deaths were attributed  to disease progression, and one death each to 
intra-abdominal hemorrhage and pulmonary em bolism (unrelated) and pulmonary embolism 
(possibly related). In Study NP28902 the cause of death for [ADDRESS_1011480] 10%

1.7 Rationale for the current trial : In this trial we propose to evaluate the combination of 
ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor, and idasanutlin, a p53 activat or and dexamethasone 
in patients with 17p deleted MM. The approach  is based on several hypotheses and available 
evidence. 
• Patients with TP53  deletion develop resistance very fast and remain the biggest 
stumbling block for successful control of this disease. Activating p53 will restore the 
sensitivity of the cell to current therapeuti cs and the combination is hence able to 
overcome drug resistance. This would be expected to be pronounced in cases where 
the remaining allele is of WT status , but not necessarily restricted to such. 
• Ixazomib has excellent activity in myelom a, relapsed and newly diagnosed, and 
offers the possibility of an all-oral regi men for 17p-deleted my eloma. In addition, 
Ixazomib has excellent soft tissue penetra tion and may be particularly helpful in 
patients with 17p-deleted myeloma, who of ten have extramedullary disease. Addition 
of dexamethasone enhances the activity of Ixazomib and hence will be added as part 
of the regimen.

Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 7.0 Protocol Treatment 
This is a sequential phase 1 followed by [CONTACT_16303] 2 design, which will allow us to assess the MTD of 
idasanutlin and ixazomib when used in comb ination, and estimate the efficacy of the 
combination.  
• Study drug dosing will span 3 weeks, with a 1-week "rest" in each 28-day cycle. 
• There will be no intra-subject dose escalation. Dose modifications for toxicity are 
outlined in Section 8.  
• All subjects are planned to receive treatment to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  
• An individual subject will be considered off-treatment following a 30-day safety follow-up period after the last cycle of treatment.

7.2 Ixazomib  
• Subjects will receive ixazomib weekly for 3 weeks (Days 1, 8 and 15) with a week 
off of each 28 day cycle. 
• Patients should be instructed to swallow ixazomib capsules whole, with water, and 
not to break, chew, or open the capsules. The study drug should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or no sooner than 2 hours after a meal. Each capsule should be swallowed separately with a sip of water. A total of approximately 8 
ounces (240 mL) of water should be taken with the capsules.  
• Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers if the next scheduled 
dose is [ADDRESS_1011495]. A double do se should not be taken to make up for a 
missed dose. If the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose 
• No intra-subject dose escalation of ixazomib will be permitted at any time during 
study.  
• Procedures for ixazomib dose reductions and delays are summarized in Section 8.2,   
along with the criteria that must be met for retreatment with study drug. If a dose is missed due to toxicity, the dose will not be made up.

events observed since the prior dose.  
NOTE: If either of idasanutlin or ixazomib is discontinued, the patient can continue on the

8.1 Dose Levels for each drug in the combination 
(Based on Adverse Events in Tables 8.2-4) 
NOTE:  For toxicities that are unrelated to dexamethasone (relate d to idasanutlin or 
ixazomib), idasanutlin should be dose reduced at the first instance of the adverse event 
followed by [CONTACT_740208]. Thereafter the drugs reduced should alternate between idasanutlin 
and ixazomib.  
NOTE:  Once Ixazomib is dose reduced to 2.3 mg, all subsequent dose reductions should 
be limited to idasanutlin. Patients cannot continue on idasanutlin alone, but can continue 
on ixazomib alone if idasanutlin is discontinued for toxicity.  
NOTE: Toxicities attributable to dexamethasone  should lead to dose reduction only for 
dexamethasone.

8.11  Instruction for initiation of a new cycle of therapy or restarting therapy after 
interruption during a cycle for toxicities 
A new cycle of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if: 
• The ANC is ≥1500/μL 
• The platelet count is ≥ 75,000/μL 
• Any other non-hematologic treatment -related adverse event that may have 
occurred has resolved to ≤Grade [ADDRESS_1011499] will be 
evaluated weekly and a new cycle of ther apy will be held until the toxicity has 
resolved as described above. 
If any drug dosing was halted during the pr evious cycle and was restarted with a 
one-level dose reduction without requiring an interruption for the remainder of 
the cycle, then that reduced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 of the new cycle. 
If any drug dosing was omitted for the remainder of the previous cycle or if the 
new cycle is held due to known hematologic toxicity newly encountered on the scheduled Day 1, then the new cycle will be started with a one-level dose 
reduction. If a new cycle of therapy cannot be restarted within 4 weeks of the scheduled Day 1 due to non-resolution of drug related toxicities, the patient will be removed from protocol therapy and will go to event monitoring.

The following medications and procedures are prohibited during the study: 
Systemic treatment with any of the follo wing metabolizing enzyme inhibitors is 
not permitted in this study. (Rationale: If there were to be a drug-drug interaction 
with an inhibitor, the idasanutlin exposure would be increased leading to a high 
probability of an adverse event.): 
• Strong inhibitors of CYP3A: clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, and posaconazole 
• Strong inhibitors of CYP2C8: anastrozole, montelukast, quercetin, trimethoprim, gemfibrozil, rosiglitazone, pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] 
9.82 Prohibitedenzyme inducers 
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inducers should be avoided, unless there is no appr opriate alternative medication for the 
patient’s use. (Rationale: Unlike with inhi bitors if there were to be a drug-drug 
interaction with an inducer, idasanutlin or ixazomib exposure would be less - so 
there is a reduced chance of an adverse ev ent. However, there may be less chance 
for an antitumor effect, but that is not an absolute reason to be taken off study):  
Strong CYP3A or CYP2C8 inducers: rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, and phenobarbita l. Extra caution should be exercised 
when using these medications concomitantly  and incidence of any side effects 
should be carefully monitored.

9.9a Erythematous Rash with or without Pruritus 
Rash with or without pruritus has been re ported with ixazomib, primarily at the higher 
doses tested and when given with agents where rash is an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171]. The rash may range from limited erythematous areas, macular and/or small papular bumps that 
may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body, to a more generalized eruption 
that is predominately on the trunk or extremities. Rash has been most commonly 
characterized as maculopapular or macular. To  date, when it does occur, rash is most 
commonly reported within the first 3 cycles of therapy. The rash is often transient, self-limiting, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_20539] 1 to 2 in severity.  
Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or  corticosteroids (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) have 
been successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylac tically in subsequent 
cycles. The use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], IV, or oral steroid (e.g., prednisone ≤10 mg per day or 
equivalent) is permitted. Ma nagement of a Grade 3 rash may require intravenous 
antihistamines or corticosteroids. Admini stration of ixazomib (and/or other causative 
MC1582 46 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 agent if given in combination) should be modified per protocol and re-initiated at a 
reduced level from where rash w as noted (also, per protocol). 
In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or 
any SAE involving rash is recommended. Prophylactic measures should also be 
considered if a patient has previously devel oped a rash (e.g., using a thick, alcohol-free 
emollient cream on dry areas of the body or oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_12669]). A rare risk is 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a severe and potentially life-threatening rash with skin peeling and mouth sores, which should be  managed symptomatically according to 
standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological analysis are encouraged 
at the discretion of the investigator. 
9.9b Thrombocytopenia 
Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia may be severe but has been manageable with platelet tr ansfusions according to standard clinical 
practice. Ixazomib and idasanutlin administ ration should be modified as noted as per 
dose modification recommendations in the protocol when thrombocytopenia occurs (see 
Section 8.2  and Section 8.3 ). Therapy can be reinitiated at  a reduced level upon recovery 
of platelet counts. A rare risk is throm botic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare 
blood disorder where blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body characterized by [CONTACT_12703], petechiae,  fever, or possibly more serious signs and 
symptoms. TTP should be managed symptomatically according to standard medical practice. 
9.9c Neutropenia 
Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Neutropenia may be severe but has been manageable. Growth factor support is not required but may be considered 
according to standard clinical practice. Idasanutlin and ixazomib administration should be 
modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in the protocol when neutropenia occurs (see Section 8.2  and Section 8.3 ). Therapy can be reinitiated at a 
reduced level upon recovery of ANCs. 
9.9d Fluid Deficit 
Vitals should be assessed prior to start of each cycle as per Table 4.1. Dehydration should be avoided since ixazomib may cause vomiting,  diarrhea, and dehydration. Patients 
should be encouraged to maintain adequate fluid intake. Acute renal failure has been 
reported in patients treated with ixazomib, commonly in the setting of the previously 
noted gastrointestinal toxicities and dehydration. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study drug and as needed dur ing treatment to avoid dehydration. 
9.9e Hypotension 
Symptomatic hypotension and orthostatic hypoten sion with or without syncope have been 
reported with ixazomib. Blood pressure should be  closely monitored while the patient is 
on study treatment and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the 
setting of concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. 
Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either 
hypo- or hypertension) should be managed according to standard clinical practice, 
including considerations for dose adjustment s of their concomitant medications during

9.9f Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome 
One case of posterior reversible encephal opathy syndrome, which ultimately resolved, 
has been reported with ixazomib. This cond ition is characterized by [CONTACT_12704], seizures 
and visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in  blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_9252] (MRI). If the syndrome is diagnosed or suspected, 
symptom-directed treatment should be mainta ined until the condition is reversed by 
[CONTACT_12706]. 
9.9g Transverse Myelitis 
Transverse myelitis has also been reported with ixazomib. It is not known if ixazomib causes transverse myelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving ixazomib, the possibility that ixazomib may have contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be excluded.

MC1582 49 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 Events that would not typi[INVESTIGATOR_15881], but 
that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to facilitate the 
review of safety data (may be requested by [CONTACT_15927]).  
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.[ADDRESS_1011506] access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic applications/ctc.htm ) 
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. 
b. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to  the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechan ism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is  required (see Section 10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mech anisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 
18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a seri ous AE, which is defined in Section 10.4. 
10.[ADDRESS_1011507] ion 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator brochure, (if an investigator brochure is not require d, otherwise described in the general 
investigational plan).  
Unexpected adverse events  or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not re quired or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/interv ention might exacerbate the exp ected AEs associated with a 
commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the comm ercial agent) occurs with a 
higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required. NOTE: *The consent form may contain study specific information  at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that th is information may NOT be included in the 
protocol or the investigator brochure. Refe r to protocol or IB for reporting needs.  
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure 
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is  related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
MC1582 50 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
 
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) 
on the SAME (Combination) Arm 
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are ) used on the same treatment arm as 
the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, 
cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire 
combination (arm) is then considered an investigational intervention for 
reporting. 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with the guidelines for investigational agents/interventions.  
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational agent/intervention must be assessed as specified in the prot ocol. In general, only Grade [ADDRESS_1011508] possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report, unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029]. Refer to Section 10.4 for 
specific AE reporting requ irements or exceptions. 
An investigational agent/inte rvention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated 
with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) 
occurs with a higher degree of severity  or specificity, expedited reporting is 
required.  
• An increased incidence of an expected  adverse event (AE) is based on the 
patients treated for this study at thei r site. A list of known/expected AEs is 
reported in the package insert or the literature, including AEs resulting from a 
drug overdose. 
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch 3500A for Health Professionals (complete all three pages of the form).

10.4 Required Reporting 
AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigati onal Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on 
the SAME Arm 
NOTE:  The combination of an investigati onal agent with a commercial agent is 
considered investigational.  
Routine Reporting  
Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an investigational agent /intervention in combination with a comme rcial agent is stated in the protocol. See 
Section 10.6.  
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as the 
investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular 
product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination 
(arm) is then considered an inves tigational intervention for reporting. 
Expedited Reporting 
MC1582 51 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with the 
guidelines for CTEP investigational agents/in terventions in Section 10.4, and where 
indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. 
An AE that occurs prior to administration of  the investigational agent/ intervention must 
be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, only Grade [ADDRESS_1011509] possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited 
report. Refer to Section 10.4 for specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions. 
An investigational agent/intervention might ex acerbate the expected AEs associated with 
a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected  AE (for the commercial agent) occurs with 
a higher degree of severity, expedited reporting is  required. The clinical investigator must 
determine severity. 
10.41 Special Situations for Expedited Reporting  
Exceptions to Expedited Reporting:  EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events1 
An expedited report may not be required fo r specific Grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 Serious 
Adverse Events where the AE is listed in Section 15.0 of the protocol or the

MC1582 52 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 10.411 Persistent or Significan t Disabilities/Incapacities 
Any AE that results in persistent or  significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly 
referred to as disabilities), congenital abnormalities or birth defects, 
must be reported immediately if they occur at any time following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE since they are considered to be a serious AE and must be reporte d to the sponsor as specified in 21 
CFR 312.64(b). 
10.412 Death 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1011511] dose, regardless of attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 28 days of life. 
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and 
polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ 
class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progr ession: clinical deterioration 
associated with a disease process) should be submitted. 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1011512] dose, regardless of 
attribution to the investigational agent/intervention requires 
expedited reporting within 24 hours. 
• Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_1011513] does of 
the investigational agent/interven tion requires expedited reporting 
within 24 hours only if it is possibly, probably, or definitely related 
to the investigational agent/intervention. 
10.413 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a 
previous malignancy (e.g., treat ment with investigational 
agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.

Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 10.[ADDRESS_1011514] be immediately reported to the sponsor within the timeframes detailed in 
the corresponding table. This reporting includes, but is not limited to SAEs that 
re-occur again after resolution. 
  10.441 Special reporting requirements for [COMPANY_005]  
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures. Any clinica lly relevant deterioration in laboratory 
assessments or other clinical finding is c onsidered an AE. When possible, signs 
and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. For serious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to study drug 
administration.  
AEs which are serious must be reporte d to [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee) from the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_1011515] dose of ixazomib. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of 
ixazomib treatment or after the designated follow-up period that the sponsor-investigator and/or sub-investigator considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovi gilance (or designee). In addition, new 
primary malignancies that occur during the follow-up periods must be reported, 
regardless of causality to study regimen, for a minimum of three years after the 
last dose of the investigational product, starting from the first dose of study drug. All new cases of primary malignanc y must be reported to [COMPANY_005] 
Pharmacovigilance (or designee). 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_740181] (e.g., 
surgery was performed earlier or late r than planned). All SAEs should be 
monitored until they are resolved or ar e clearly determined to be due to a 
patient’s stable or chronic cond ition or intercu rrent illness(es). 
Since this is an investigator-initiated study, the principal investigator, Shaji 
Kumar, MD, also referred to as the sponsor-investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) to any regulatory agency and to the 
sponsor- investigator’s EC or IRB. 
Regardless of expectedness or causality, a ll SAEs (including serious pretreatment 
events) must also be reported in English to [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee): 
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours of the sponsor-investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event 
All other serious (non-fatal/non-life-threatening) events within 4 calendar 
days of the sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event 
See below for contact [CONTACT_212264]. 
The sponsor-investigator must fax or email the SAE Form per the timelines 
above. A sample of an SAE Form will be provided. 
MC1582 56 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 The SAE report must include at minimum: 
• Event term(s) 
• Serious criteria  
• Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investigator’s 
determination. Intensity for each SAE,  including any lab abnormalities, will 
be determined by [CONTACT_128751], as 
a guideline, whenever possible. Th e criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
• Causality of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investigator’s 
determination of the relationship of the event(s) to study drug administration.  
Follow-up information on the SAE may be requested by [CONTACT_11750]. 
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be determined by 
[CONTACT_91853], as a guideline, whenever possible. The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
In the event that this is a multisite stud y, the sponsor-investigator is responsible 
to ensure that the SAE reports are sent to [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from all sites participating in the study. Sub-investigators must report 
all SAEs to the sponsor-investigator so that the sponsor-investigator can meet 
his/her foregoing reporting obligations to  the required regulatory agencies and to 
[COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance, unless othe rwise agreed between the sponsor-
investigator and sub-investigator(s). 
Relationship to all study drugs for each SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_478595]-investigator by [CONTACT_91854]: Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug(s)? 
Sponsor-investigator must also provide [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance with a copy 
of all communications with applicable re gulatory authorities related to the study 
product(s), as soon as possible but no later than 4 calendar days of such 
communication.

10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with inves tigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an IND will be reported. Three options are available to describe the event: 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML]) 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy

Serum or urine M spi[INVESTIGATOR_480132] t a requirement for entry into the study. If 
present, and meets criteria for measurable di sease this will be followed for M protein 
response using IMWG uniform response criteria as described below. 
• M-protein: synonyms include M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], monoclonal protein and myeloma protein, 
paraprotein, M-component. 
Serum M-protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases 
where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable. 
• M-proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M-proteins) 
• Cases in which the M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_212234] (some specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by [CONTACT_7809] 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the agarose gel 
• Cases in which there are multiple peaks of same monoclonal protein 
(aggregates or dimers) 
If SPEP is not available or felt to be unr eliable (above examples) for routine M-
protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accep ted. However, this must be explicitly 
reported at baseline, and only nephelometr y can be used for that patient to assess 
response. SPEP derived M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_357670]. 
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only. Random or 24 h 
urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not 
recommended. 
• FLC estimation is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, The 
Binding Site Limited, [LOCATION_006]). Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are defined 
as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having a 
monoclonal kappa FLC. The monoclonal light  chain isotype is considered the 
involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC type. 
• Response terms:  The following response terms will be used to define M protein 
response: stringent Complete Response (s CR), complete response (CR), very good 
partial response (VGPR), partial respons e (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable 
disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD).  
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response 
category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making and test ordering. These designations will be applied at the time of the first 
measurement at which the quantitative asp ect of the response category has been 
satisfied without the confirmation step having been satisfied. The designation “u” 
will precede the standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD.  
• Measurable disease: Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-protein.  
o Serum M-protein ≥1 g/dl  
o Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h 
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dl provided serum FLC ratio is 
abnormal 
MC1582 63 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to 
therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and should be 
used in assessing response only if th e baseline serum and/or urine M proteins 
are not “measurable” as above, and the baseline level of the involved FLC is 
“measurable.” When using this assay, it is important to note that the FLC levels 
vary considerably with changes in re nal function and in patients with renal 
insufficiency, the levels of both the kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the 
ratio normalizes with achievement of CR. Thus, both the level of the involved and 
the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-
uninvolved difference) should be considered in assessing response. Patients 
included on the study on the basis of FLC alone (i.e., no measurable serum/urine 
m-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]) should be the only ones who are evaluated using FLC response criteria. 
The others should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results with the exception 
of defining stringent complete response. 
• Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], serum 
free light chain, or urine M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]. 
• Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had 
“measurable” serum M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_357671] M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], but has had a detectable monoclonal 
protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum free light chain.  
• Non-secretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had a 
detectable monoclonal protein in his/her serum and/or urine.

• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128712], 
except for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required 
to document all response categories including progression. However, a second 
confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response in any case. 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; 
however, if radiographic studies were perfo rmed there should be no evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions. 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 11.2  
11.4 Bone progression:  
Caution must be exercised to avoid rating pr ogression or relapse on the basis of variation 
of radiologic technique alone. Compression fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression. When progression is based on skeletal disease alone, it should be discussed with the Study Chair befo re removing the patient from the study.  
11.5 Response and Progression:  
Criteria for response and progression are listed in Table 11.5. Progressive disease for all 
patients as defined in Table 11.5. Although the definition for “relapse from CR (or sCR) is listed, this will be documented as a response category in ONLY those protocols evaluating disease free survival.

a All response categories require two consecutive assessments made at a nytime before the institution of any 
new therapy; complete and PR, MR and SD categories also require no known evidence of progressive or 
new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy 
these response requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed. Each category, except for 
stable disease, will have a working subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u”] to designate first time 
point at which response category MAY have been achieved if confirmed. 
b Presence/absence of clonal cells is based up on the k/  ratio. An abnormal k/  ratio by 
[CONTACT_145170]/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. 
An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is k/  of >4:1 or <1:2.  
c Positive immunofixation alone in a patient previously classified as CR will not be considered progression. 
d Progressive disease should be confirmed. However, treatment may be discontinued for progressive 
disease that is unconfirmed per physician discretion. In this case, an objective status of PD should be 
entered on the measurement form and progressive di sease should be reported on the event monitoring 
form.

MC1582 71 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 15.0 Drug Information 
15.1 Ixazomib 
15.11 Background: Ixazomib (MLN9708) is a second-generation small molecule 
inhibitor of the 20S proteasome that is under development for the treatment of 
non-hematologic malignancies, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. 
Ixazomib ( MLN2238) refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form of the drug 
substance, ixazomib citrate (MLN9708). The transition to MLN2238 occurs in any 
aqueous system. 
 
15.12 Formulation: The ixazomib (MLN9708) capsule drug product formulation 
consists of drug substance, microcry stalline cellulose, talc, and magnesium 
stearate. Seven different capsule strengths are manufactured: 0.2, 0.5, 2.0, 2.3, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.5 mg; each capsule streng th has a unique color. Dosage strength is 
stated as ixazomib (the active boronic acid). Ixazomib capsules are individually 
packaged in blisters. 
 
Matching placebo capsules have been manufact ured for the 2.3, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.5 
mg ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules. The placebo capsules contain microcrystalline cellulose, talc, and magnesi um stearate and are identical in color 
and size to the corresponding active dose. 
 15.13 Preparation and storage : Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules (0.2 mg, 0.5 mg, 2 
mg), individually packaged in blisters, can be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC or “Do not store above 25ºC. Do not freeze.” Ixazomib capsules (2.3 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, and 
5.5 mg), individually packaged in blisters, can be stored at “2ºC - 8ºC” or “Do 
not store above 30ºC. Do not freeze.”   
 
Ixazomib that is dispensed to the patient  for take-home dosing should remain in 
the blister packaging until the point of use.  The investigative site is responsible 
for providing the medication to the patient in units that comprise the correct daily 
dose configurations. Capsules should remain in  the blisters until the point of use.  
Ixazomib capsules must be administered as intact capsules and must not be opened or manipulated in any way. Comprehensive instructions should be provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance with dosing procedures. Patients will be instructed to store the medication in the refrigerator until the time 
of use. Reconciliation will occur accordingl y when the patient returns for their 
next cycle of therapy. Any extremes in temperature should be reported as an excursion and will be managed on a case by  [CONTACT_413]. Returned unused capsules 
should be discarded in a proper biohazard container. 
 
Ixazomib is an anticancer drug. As with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised when handling ixazomib. It is recommended to wear gloves and protective garments during pr eparation when dispensed in clinic. 
(Please refer to published guidelines rega rding the proper handling and disposal 
of anticancer agents. 
 
15.14 Administration:  Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules must  be administered as intact 
capsules and are not intended to be opened  or manipulated in any way.  Capsules 
MC1582 72 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 should be taken on an empty stomach with a pproximately 8 oz (1 cup) of water at 
least [ADDRESS_1011525] 2 hours after food 
. 
Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient  has had a serious allergic reaction to 
boron or boron containing products. 
Capsules of ixazomib will also be referr ed to as study drug. Study drug will be 
supplied by [CONTACT_11750]/Millennium as capsules of 2.3-, 3.0- and 4.0 mg ixazomib. 
Patients should be instructed to swallo w ixazomib capsules whole, with water, 
and not to break, chew, or open the capsules. Study drug should be taken on an 
empty stomach (no food or drink) at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. 
Each capsule should be swallowed separat ely with a sip of water. A total of 
approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of wate r should be taken with the capsules. 
Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers if the next scheduled dose is [ADDRESS_1011526]. A double dose should not be taken to make up for 
a missed dose. If the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not 
repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose. 
 15.15 Pharmacokinetic (PK) information :  
a) Absorption: After oral dosing, ixazomi b is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_19627] a median 
T
max of 1 hour. The lack of a discernible relationship between BSA and ixazomib 
clearance over a relatively wide BSA range (1.4-2.6 m2) indicates that total 
systemic exposure (AUC) following fixed dosing should be independent of the 
individual patient’s BSA. A high-fat meal decreased both the rate and extent of absorption. Therefore, ixazomib should be  administered on an empty stomach.   
 
b) Distribution: The steady state volume of distribution is large and is estimated 
to be 543 L. Ixazomib is 88-94% protein bound. Ixazomib protein binding was subsequently investigated in plasma samples from 75 cancer patients including 
those with normal hepatic and renal function (N = 23), with severe renal 
impairment including patients w ith end-stage renal disease requiring 
hemodialysis (N = 18), or with moderate  (N = 15) or severe (N = 19) hepatic 
impairment (Studies C16015 and C16018). These definitive studies demonstrated 
that ixazomib was 99% bound to plasma proteins and the extent of binding was not altered by [CONTACT_740211], moderate hepatic impairment, or severe 
hepatic impairment. 
 
c) Metabolism: Metabolism is expected to be the major mechanism of clearance 
(CL) of ixazomib as renal clearance contributes approximately 3.7% to CL/F and 6.4% to CL At 0.1 and 0.5 μM substrate concentrations, which are closer to 
clinical concentrations of ixazomib following oral administration of 4 mg, non-CYP mediated clearance was observed and seemed to play a major role in 
ixazomib clearance in vitro. At clinically relevant concentrations of ixazomib, no 
specific CYP isozyme predominantly contributes to ixazomib metabolism and non-CYP proteins may contribute to the clearance of ixazomib in different capacities. Therefore, at clinically relevant concentrations of ixazomib, minimal CYP-mediated DDIs with a selective CYP inhibitor would be expected. 
 
MC1582 73 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 d) Excretion: The mean terminal half- life is 9.[ADDRESS_1011527] for ixazomib. Dosing adjustment is not required in 
patients with mild and moderate  renal impairment in studies.  However, in a 
dedicated renal impairment study (C1 6015), unbound AUC0-last was 38% higher 
in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis as compared to patients with normal renal function. A reduced starting dose of ixazomib is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment. Unbound systemic exposures of  ixazomib are 27% higher in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairme nt as compared to patients with normal 
hepatic function. A reduced starting dose of ixazomib is recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic  impairment. 
 
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :  
The PK of ixazomib was similar with and without coadministration of 
clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, and therefore no dose adjustment is 
necessary when ixazomib is administered with CYP3A inhibitors. In the population PK analysis, coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors did not affect ixazomib clearance. Thus, no dose adjustment is required for patients receiving strong CYP1A2 inhi bitors. In a clinical rifampin DDI 
study, ixazomib C
max and AUC 0-last were reduced in the presence of rifampin by 
[CONTACT_3450] 54% and 74%, respectively. As a result, the coadministration of strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib should be avoided.  Ixazomib is neither a time-dependent nor reversible inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, or 3A4/5, therefore the potential for ixazomib to produce DDIs via CYP isozyme inhibition is low.  Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and 
CYP3A4/5 activity.  The potential for ixazomib to cause DDIs with substrates or 
inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, MATE-1, MATE2-K, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, and OATPs is low. 
 Pharmacokinetic parameters for ixazomib coadministered with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone (LenDex) are similar to those observed when ixazomib is 
administered as a single agent. This sugg ests that there is no readily apparent 
effect of coadministration of LenDex on the clinical PK of ixazomib. 
 Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient  has had a serious allergic reaction to 
boron or boron containing products. 
 
15.17 Known potential toxicities : See the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure for more complete informati on including potential risks, as well as 
recommendations for clinical monitoring and medical management of toxicity.

MC1582 74 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 Herpes zoster – antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients 
being treated with ixazomib to d ecrease the risk of herpes zoster 
reactivation.  
Rare but serious risks –  intestinal obstruction,  life-threatening severe 
skin rash (Steven Johnson syndrome, TEN, DRESS syndrome), thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura, tumor lysis syndrome, renal failure, bowel blockage, posterior reversible en cephalopathy syndrome, transverse 
myelitis, progressive multifo cal leukoencephalopathy. 
 
Overdose –  There is no known specific antidote for ixazomib overdose.  
In the event of an overdose in blinded studies, study medication 
assignment should be unblinded immediately.  The clinician should consider admitting the patient to the ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_128722], monitoring 
for adverse drug reactions, monitoring of vital signs, and appropriate supportive care.  Gavage may be consid ered, but it should be kept in mind 
that ixazomib absorption is rapid.  Ix azomib is not readily dialyzable.   
 
15.18 Drug procurement:  Investigational product will be  supplied free of charge to 
trial participants by [CONTACT_11750]/Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Ixazomib Destruction: Investigational ix azomib (expi[INVESTIGATOR_20538]) should 
be destroyed on site according to the in stitution’s standard operating procedure.

15.23 Preparation and storage : Film-coated tablets of idasanutlin should be stored 
under the recommended storage conditions: Do not store above 25°C. 
15.24 Administration:  Refer to the treatment section for specific administration 
instructions. 
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information :  
Absorption: There was no major effect of high-fat or low-fat food on PK exposure.  Protein binding:  99.99% 
 Metabolism:  The main human CYP enzymes responsible for RO5503781 
metabolism are CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8.  CYP3A4 was found to be responsible 
for the formation of the oxidative metabolites (M1, M2, and M4) of RO5503781 in human liver microsomes, and accounts for approximately 80% of the total 
metabolism in human liver microsomes. 
 Half-life elimination: approximately 1 day  Time to peak:  7.5 hours 
Excretion:   No parent idasanutlin was detected (<1%) in urine samples. 
Metabolite M4 (RO6802287) was the only major metabolite in human plasma samples.  No apparent difference in PK exposure was found between patients 
with solid tumors and patients with AML in the dose range of 400 to 1600 mg daily × [ADDRESS_1011529] Asia n patients did not appear to differ from 
other patient ethnicities (mainly Caucasians).  Race, Age (23-83), gender, body 
weight (42.2 − 132.1 kg), body surface area (1.322 −2.64 m
2), concomitant 
cytarabine administration, disease status (AML vs solid tumor), and creatinine 
clearance (39.7 − 200.2 mL/min) does not appear to have an impact on PK 
exposure. 
  
MC1582 76 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 15.26 Potential Drug Interactions :  
Idasanutlin has a low potential for drug-drug interaction as a perpetrator with 
CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, P-gp, BCRP, and CYP2B6 but a higher 
potential for DDIs with CYP2C8 substrat es.  Idasanutlin is metabolized by 
[CONTACT_740212], mainly by[CONTACT_12075] (65% −80%) and to a 
lesser extent by [CONTACT_49868]2C8 and CYP3A4/5. Strong inhibitors and/or inducers of these enzymes may affect idasanutlin exposure. However, a human study with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor suggested a minimal effect of idasanutlin exposure. CYP2C8 inhibitors are to be  avoided when CYP3A4 inhibitors are 
allowed. Gemfibrozil, an UGT inhibitor,  is also a CYP2C8 inhibitor that is 
excluded. The M4 metabolite of idasa nutlin is an OATP B1/3 transporter 
inhibitor and thus concomitant u se of statins should be avoided. 
 
15.27 Known potential toxicities : 
 
Very common ( ≥10%): diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, sepsis, anemia, pneumonia, 
pyrexia, fatigue, asthenia, fungal infections, electrolyte disorders (hypokalemia, 
hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, and hyperphosphatemia)  Common (1%- <10%): tumor lysis syndrome 
 
Uncommon (0.1%- <1%):  leukopenia  
 Serious potential risks: supraventricular arrhythmias, hepatic toxicity, 
pulmonary embolism  
 
Special populations:  Idasanutlin should not be administered to pregnant women. It is not known 
whether idasanutlin is excreted in human  milk.  It has not been studied in 
pediatric, therefore idasanutlin should not  be administered to this patient 
population Treatment with idasanutlin in patient s with specific medical conditions 
such as mild heart failure, pulmonary  insufficiency, or inadequately 
controlled diabetes mellitus has not been formally evaluated.  It is 
recommended to avoid treatment in diabetic patients not optimally controlled with medical management (e.g., presence of ketoacidosis).

16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Overview 
This is a Phase I/II study of a novel regimen of idasanutlin and ixazomib in combination 
with dexamethasone in patien ts with 17p deleted relapsed multiple myeloma. The Phase I 
study is designed to determine the maximally  tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity profile 
of ixazomib and idasanutlin in combination with  dexamethasone in patients with relapsed 
multiple myeloma using the standard cohort 3+3 design. The Phase II portion is designed 
to assess the confirmed response rate assoc iated with therapy with ixazomib and 
idasanutlin in combination with dexamethasone , in patients with 17p deleted relapsed 
multiple myeloma. 
16.11 Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of the phase I portion of this trial is to assess the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of ixazomib and idasanutlin in combination with dexamethasone. 
The primary endpoint of the phase [ADDRESS_1011532] 6 months. 
MC1582 80 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 16.[ADDRESS_1011533] 3+3 phase I 
design will be utilized. Three patients will be treated at each dose level and observed for 
a minimum of four weeks (i.e. one full cycle)  before new patients are treated. Doses will 
not be escalated in any individual patient.  
16.[ADDRESS_1011534] dose that induces dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of a maximum 
of 6 new patients). A total of [ADDRESS_1011535] 25% will be observe d with a probability of at least 82% (1-
(1-0.25)6). 
Refer to Section 7.65 for definition of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). 
 
16.22 MTD Determination: 
Dose Escalation: The phase I portion of this study will utilize a standard cohort of three design.The dose levels to whic h patients will be assigned in sequential 
cohorts are described in Section 7.6.The first cohort of three patients will be 
treated at dose level 0. Decisions on wh en and how to dose escalate are described 
below. 
16.[ADDRESS_1011536] one of these additional three patients ( ≥2 of 6), the 
MTD will have been exceeded a nd further accrual will cease to this 
cohort. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is not seen in any of the three 
additional patients, [ADDRESS_1011537] been exceeded and defined as the previous dose unless only 3 patients were treated at the lower dose level. In that case, 3 additional patients will be treated at this lower dose level such that a total of 6 patients are treated at the MTD to 
more fully assess the toxiciti es associated with the MTD. 
16.225  Dose de-escalation: If dose-limiting toxicity meets the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_740187] 0 (for 
example, more than 1 out of 3 patients or more than 1 out of 6 patients), the next cohort of three patients will be entered at a dose level of -1. If dose level -1 meets the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239], the next cohort of three patients will be entered at dose leve l -2. Further dose re-escalation will 
MC1582 81 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 depend on the toxicity profile observed at these dose levels, and re-
evaluation of the regimen by [CONTACT_740214]. 
16.[ADDRESS_1011538] cohort of 3 design: The following 
table gives the probability of dose escalation at a single dose level as a function of the true probability of DLT at that level using the cohorts of 3 design described above. 
 
True Rate of DLT (%)  Probability of Dose Escalation  
10 0.91 
20 0.71 
30 0.49 
40 0.31 
50 0.17 
 
16.23 Analysis Plans: 
All the relevant results pertaining to toxicity, MTD, response, timed endpoints and laboratory correlates will be examined in an exploratory and hypothesis-generating fashion. The small sample size and the heterogeneous patient 
population associated with phase I studies restricts the generalizability of the 
results. Any notable statistical result should only be viewed as preliminary evidence for further study in Phase II trials rather than a definitive finding in and of itself. 
16.231  Adverse Events Profile 
The number and severity of all adverse events (overall and by [CONTACT_2715]-level) 
will be tabulated and summarized in this patient population. The Grade 
3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar fashion. This will provide an indicatio n of the level of tolerance for this 
treatment combination in this patient group.  
16.[ADDRESS_1011539] toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia will be assessed using continuous variables 
as the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well as categorization via CTC standard toxicity grading. Ov erall toxicity incidence as well as 
toxicity profiles by [CONTACT_15994], patie nt and tumor site will be explored 
and summarized. Frequency distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will form th e basis of these analyses.

MC1582 82 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 begun treatment will be evaluable for response. Responses will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_740215].  
 
16.3  Phase II  Statistical Design 
 
16.31 Decision Rule 
In previous single agent studies in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma, response rates of 19-30% have been seen.(Leleu, Karlin et al. 2015) A response 
rate higher than 25% for idasanutlin and ixazomib in combination with 
dexamethasone would be of interest in patients with relapsed 17p deleted 
multiple myeloma.  
The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be 
considered ineffective in this popul ation is 25%, and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in 
this patient population is 45%. The following one-stage binomial design uses [ADDRESS_1011541] 25%.  
16.311 Final Decision Rule: If [ADDRESS_1011542] 12, 
this will be considered evidence of promising activity and the treatment 
may be recommended for further testing in subsequent studies. 
16.312 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the final decision rule or 
used in any decision making process. Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in Section 16.44. 
16.32 Power and Significance Level:  
Assuming that the number of successes is binomially distributed, the significance level is .08, i.e. there is a 8% chance of  finding the drug to be effective when it 
truly is not. The probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further study 
(i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true success proportion as shown in the following table. 
 
If the true success proportion is... 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further study is… 0.08 0.23 0.45 0.68 0.85 
 
16.33 Other considerations: Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or 
changes in standard care will be taken in to account in any decision to terminate 
the study 
16.4 Analysis Plan 
The analysis for this trial will commence at planned time points (see 16.3) and at the time 
the patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. The Statistician and Study 
Chair will make the decision, in accord w ith CCS Standard Operating Procedures, 
MC1582 83 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 availability of data for secondary endpoints (e.g., laboratory correlates), and the level of 
data maturity. It is anticipated that the ear liest date in which the results will be made 
available via manuscript, abstract, or presentation format is when last patient has been 
followed for at least 6 months. 
 
16.41 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
16.411 Definition: The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients 
who achieve a confirmed response. A confirmed response is defined as 
an sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR noted as the objective status on two 
consecutive evaluations. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who 
have signed a consent form and have  begun treatment will be evaluable 
for response, unless they are determined to be a major violation. 
16.412 Estimation: The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_128771]. Exact 
binomial 95% confidence intervals fo r the true success proportion will be 
calculated. 
 16.[ADDRESS_1011543] binomial 95% 
confidence intervals for the true success proportions will be calculated.
 
16.422 Overall survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to 
any cause. The distribution of overall survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier (Kaplan and Meier, 1958).  
16.[ADDRESS_1011544] date of documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. The distribution of progression-free survival will be

16.424 Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will 
be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The 
maximum grade for each type of adve rse event will be recorded for each 
patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. 
Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. 
16.43 Correlative Analyses: Due to the small overall sample size, the results of these 
analyses will be considered explorator y and hypothesis-generating in nature.
 
16.[ADDRESS_1011545] of inhibition of mdm2 will be assessed by [CONTACT_740216].

Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 expression profiling.The correlation between potential biomarkers and 
response (responders vs. non-responders) will be evaluated using Fisher’s exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, where appropriate. 
16.44  Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to eval uate the final decision rule or used in 
any decision making processes; however, they will be included in final endpoint estimates and confidence intervals. 
16.5 Data & Safety Monitoring: 
16.51 The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_128775].

experience a Grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event with an attribution of unlikely, possibly, pr obably, or definitely related to 
treatment over all cycles at any given dose level. 
 
16.522 Phase II (includes all phase II pati ents, including phase I patients 
treated at the MTD): 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we 
observe events with an attribution of unlikely, possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to study treatment that satisfy one of the following: 
• if [ADDRESS_1011550] 15 treated patients experience a 
grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event  
• if after the first [ADDRESS_1011551] been treated, 40% of all patients experience a grade 4 or higher non-hematologic adverse event.  
MC1582 85 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed 
“unrelated” or “unlikely to be related” , to verify their attribution and to 
monitor the emergence of a previ ously unrecognized treatment-related 
adverse event.

Other Information:  
 
A description of this clinical  trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as required 
by U.S. Law. This Website will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Website will include a summary of  the results. You can search this Website at any time. 
  
 
1. Why are you being asked to take part in this research study? 
 
 You are being asked to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed with a type of 
blood cancer called “multiple myeloma” that requir es treatment. In addition, your myeloma cells 
have a particular abnormality in the chromoso mes that makes your multiple myeloma harder to 
treat.  About 53 people will take part  in this research study. 
  
 
2. Why is this research study being done? 
 
 This research study is being done to see if th e combination of two new drugs will allow better 
control of multiple myeloma where the cancer cells  have lost a part or all of a chromosome 
(chromosome 17), a situation that is difficult to  treat with the current standard treatment. 
 In this study, you will be trea ted with a combination of two drugs called ixazomib and 
idasanutlin. It is thought that ixazomib will interf ere with the process of protein breakdown in the 
multiple myeloma cells. Idasanutlin can make th e myeloma cells more sensitive to treatment 
with other drugs like ixazomib, by [CONTACT_740220]. The combination 
of drugs used in this study are considered investigational, which means they have either not been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for routine clinical use or for the use described in this study. This st udy is being done to find out wh at effects (good and bad) the 
MC1582 100 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 combination of ixazomib and idasanutlin with dexamethasone has on you and your multiple 
myeloma.   
 
3. Information you should know  
 
 
Who is Funding the Study? 
 
[COMPANY_005]/Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Ro che Pharmaceuticals are funding the study. 
[COMPANY_005]/Millennium and [COMPANY_002] will pay the Mu ltiple Myeloma Research Foundation/Multiple 
Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRF/MMRC) to  cover costs related to running the study. 
 
Information Regarding Conflict of Interest: 
 
Your doctor may be referring you to this study and if your doctor is also an Investigator in this study, he or she has a conflict by [CONTACT_480172] (your well-being, and the scientific 
conduct of the study). If you are uncom fortable with your doctor work ing with you as part of this 
research study, but still wish to participate in  the research, you may request to work with a 
different member of the research team.   
 
4. How long will you be in this research study?  
 
 You will be in the study for approximately three years. You will be in the study for as long as 
your multiple myeloma is responding to the treatm ent and you are not havi ng side effects that 
cannot be managed.   
 
5. What will happen to you while you are in this research study?  
 
 
If you agree to be in the study, you will be aske d to participate in the following tests and 
procedures. These tests and procedures are part of regular care for multiple myeloma: 
 
Prior to Registration 
• Physical exam including complete medical hi story, height, weight and vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate, pulse, etc.) 
• ECOG performance status (assessment of your ability to carry out daily activities) 
• Routine blood and urine tests

6. What are the possible risks or discomforts from being in this research 
study?  
 
 
You may have side effects while on the study. Ever yone taking part in the study will be watched 
carefully for any side effects. However, doctors  don’t know all the side effects that may happen. 
Side effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help 
lessen side effects. In some cases, side effect s can be serious, long lasting, or may never go 
away.  You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you ha ve while taking part in the 
study. 
 
As with any medication, allergic reactions are a possibility. 
 
Potential discomforts and risks of ixazomib 
Based on early studies of ixazomib, it is possible to predict some of the discomforts and risks. 
The data suggest that the potential risks of ix azomib are likely to be manageable if monitored 
and treated. However, risks could become serious and potentially life-thre atening. It is possible 
that ixazomib may cause side effects that were not seen in animal studies or  yet seen in patients. 
The following side effects might be seen. 
 Common risks of ixazomib (events occurring greater than 20% of the time) 
• Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea) 
• Throwing up (vomiting) 
• Loose stools (diarrhea) 
• Constipation 
• Feeling tired or weak 
• Decreased number of blood cells (platelets) th at help to clot th e blood, which could put 
you at increased risk of bleeding (thrombocytopenia) 
• A low number of white blood cells, which are the infection fighting cells, which could 
put you at risk for infection (Neutropenia) 
• A low number of a particular white blood cell,  which is important to the immune system 
(Lymphopenia)  
• Infection including shingles 
• Decrease in red blood cells, which are the oxygen carrying cells which could make you 
feel tired (Anemia)  
• Fever 
• Infection including shingles 
• Skin rash 
• Swelling of extremities 
• Numbness and tingling (also known as peripheral neuropathy) 
 
MC1582 103 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 Less likely risks of ixazomib (events occurring less than or  equal to 20% of the time)

• A complication that may occur if the can cer cells die too qu ickly that includes 
inappropriate increase or decr ease of various na tural chemicals in the blood stream, 
called uric acid, phosphorus, potassium, creatin ine, and calcium. Severe tumor lysis can 
result in kidney failure and may harm musc le or nerve function (tumor lysis syndrome) 
• High creatinine and renal failure. The amount of creatinine (a wa ste product made by 
[CONTACT_39625]) in your blood helps your doctor understand how your kidneys are working. 
High creatinine means your kidneys  are having trouble working well.  Patients who had 
lost body water because of vomiti ng and/or loose stools have ha d high levels of creatinine 
indicating that the kidneys were  failing to function adequately . In some severe situations, 
less kidney function may require temporary treatment with a machine that supports the 
function of the kidney (dialysis).

 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML ) has been reported with ixazomib in an 
oncology patient who had previously  received a medication associated with PML. PML is a rare, 
serious infection of the brain that is caused by a virus. Persons with a weakened immune system 
may develop PML. PML can result in death or severe disability. It is not known whether ixazomib may have contributed to the development PML in this patient.

Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 OTHER RISKS 
 
Standard of Care Risks 
 
Additionally, you might also have side effects or discomforts that  are not listed in this form. 
Some side effects are not yet know n, and every risk or side eff ect cannot be predicted. You may 
experience unexpected side effects or be at ri sk for symptoms, illnesses, and/or complications 
that could not be predicted. Tell your study docto r or study staff right away if you have any 
problems.  Many side effects go away shortly after the st udy drugs are stopped, but in some cases side 
effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away . There may be a risk of death. Some 
side effects may not be known. Side effects may range from mild to life-threatening. Other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and less uncomfortable. Talk to the researcher 
and/or your healthcare provider about side  effects and ask any other questions. 
 Your doctor will discuss the risks of biopsies,  X-rays, scans, and blood and urine testing,  as these 
tests and procedures are part of  your standard clinical care. 
 
Blood Samples 
Blood samples will be taken using a needle from a vein in your arm during the study. The taking 
of a blood sample may cause some discomfort and bruising, and there is a potential for infection. 
Other risks, although rare, incl ude dizziness and fainting. The maximum amount of blood that 
will be taken at any study visit is about 42 mL (less than 3 tablespoons).  Blood loss from taking research samples and the side effects of the study drug may cause anemia 
(low red blood cell count). Anemia may make you feel tired. Some people may need iron 
supplements to compensate for the blood loss resulting from the procedures done during this study. Please make sure that you discuss this issu e with the study doctor or  your personal doctor. 
 
Non-Physical Risks 
You may lose time at work or home and spend more  time in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480150]’s office 
than usual.  
BIRTH CONTROL, DANGERS OF PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING 
 You must not get pregnant while  in this study. If you are or b ecome pregnant, there may be 
unknown risks to the baby. If you may be able to  have children, you will be given a pregnancy 
test at screening, and if the result is positive,  you will not be able to be in the study. If you are 
sexually active, and able to have children, you an d your partner must use two (2) highly effective 
forms of birth control throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_1011557]  dose of study drugs.  
 Acceptable non-hormonal birth control methods include:  
• Total sexual abstinence. Abstinen ce must be for the total durati on of the study i.e. from when 
you sign the informed consent form (ICF) until  [ADDRESS_1011558] dose of study drug 
MC1582 107 Addendum 7  
Protocol version date: 17Mar2020 • Male sexual partner who has undergone a vasectomy plus male condom with spermicide. 
(You will need to confirm that your partner’s sperm was tested after the vasectomy procedure 
and that he was confir med to be sterile.) 
• Tubal occlusion plus male condom with spermicide  
• Intrauterine Device (IUD) plus male condom with spermicide 
 Acceptable hormonal methods include:  
• Etonogestrel implants (e.g., Implanon®, Norpla n®) plus male condom with spermicide 
• Normal and low dose combined oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_480149] 
• Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol (EE) transder mal system plus male condom with spermicide 
• Intravaginal device (e.g., EE and etonogestrel) plus male condom with spermicide 
• Cerazette® (desogestrel) plus male condom with spermicide. (Cerazette® is currently the 
only highly efficacious pr ogesterone based pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].) 
 You should discuss with your study doctor whic h birth control methods are considered 
acceptable. 
 
A pregnancy test can be wrong. If you become pre gnant or think you may be pregnant during the 
study, stop taking study capsules and contact [CONTACT_39635]’s office immediately. You will be 
asked to withdraw from the study. You must not  be breast-feeding an infant during the study. 
The study drug may cause unforeseeable risk to a breastfed baby. The study doctor must follow 
up and document the course and the outcome of a ll pregnancies, even if you withdraw from the 
study or if the study has finished. 
 FOR MEN If not sexually abstinent, men who have female  partner(s) of childbear ing potential should not 
father a child.  Men must also agree to use an effective method of birth control before starting 
study treatment, during study treatment, and for [ADDRESS_1011559]. There may be a risk of 
death. Some side effects may not be known. Side e ffects may range from mild to life-threatening. 
Other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and less uncomfortable. Talk to the 
researcher and/or your healthcare provider abou t side effects and ask any other questions.

Background and Study Rationale: Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men in the [LOCATION_002] (US) , and 
the second -most common cause of cancer -related mortality, with approximately 30,[ADDRESS_200591] 359,000 deaths estimated in 2018.2 The course 
of prostate cancer from diagnosis to death is often a series of clinical states progressing 
from localized disease to metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a 
disease state characterized by [CONTACT_171310].  
Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) has been observed in many carcinomas, 
including prostate cancer. Men with a germline mutation in breast cancer gene 2 ( BRCA2 ) 
are at increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_171278], estimated at 2.[ADDRESS_200592] cancer 
gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) are also associated with more aggressive disease.[ADDRESS_200593] cancer gene 1 or 2 (BRCA1/2 ), somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 and

FANCA) have been shown to occur in advanced prostate cancer, suggesting that a 
significant percentage of patients with mCRPC may benefit from approaches exploiting a deficiency in homologous recombination repair  (HRR) , such as a poly( adenosine 
diphosphate [ ADP ]-ribose) polymerase  (PARP)  inhibitor (PARPi).

The TRITON2 study (CO-338-052) is evaluating rucaparib in patients with DNA -damage 
repair (DDR) gene alterations who progressed on 1 to  2 lines of androgen 
receptor  (AR) -directed therapy and [ADDRESS_200594] cancer gene ( BRCA)-mutated 
mCRPC patients administered rucaparib 600  mg twice a day (BID)  demonstrated  a 44% 
overall response rate (ORR)  by [CONTACT_171311] (IRR) in 62 patients 
evaluable by [CONTACT_16622] ( RECIST Version  [v]1.1)

Androgen deprivation therapy is the standard first -line systemic treatment for metastatic 
prostate cancer. It is highly active with clinical, radiological and prostate -specific 
antigen ( PSA) responses for most patients –but almost all men will eventually progress to 
mCRPC. Over the last [ADDRESS_200596]- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171279]; however, patients progress on these AR-directed

[ADDRESS_200599]. 
The study will evaluate the combinations of rucaparib with 2 widely used AR -directed 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , enzalutamide and abiraterone. Enzalutamide is a next -generation anti -androgen

Confidential  Page 7 of 106 that acts on multiple steps of AR signaling within prostate cancer tumor cells and is  
indicated for the treatment of patients with castration -resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC).19, 20 
Abiraterone is a n inhibitor of 17α -hydroxylase/C17,20- lyase (CYP17) , an enzyme 
expressed in testicular, adrenal and prostatic tumor tissues, which is required for androgen 
biosynthesis. The blockade of nongonadal androgen production is a key factor in treating CRPC, since prostate cancer cells are dependent on androgens. Abiraterone  is indicated in 
combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with mCRPC and metastatic high- risk castration -sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).
21 The addition of prednisone is to 
prevent mineralocorticoid excess- related adverse events ( AEs; such as hypertension, 
hypokalemia and fluid retention), resulting from CYP17 inhibition.22 
Subsequent arms of the study may include other combination partners (eg, other 
AR-directed  therapy in development or immune modulators such as checkpoint inhibitors). 
Study Arms  
Treatment Arm A: Rucaparib and e nzalutamide  
Treatment Arm B: Rucaparib and abiraterone   
Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics ( PK), safety and tolerability  of rucaparib in 
combination with other anticancer agents for mCRPC . 
Secondary Objectives: 
• To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of rucaparib in combination with other anticancer 
agents for mCRPC.  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To evaluate the PK of mCRPC anticancer agents when administered in combination 
with rucaparib . 
• To assess the relationship between genomic alterations detected in tissue or blood with clinical outcomes to treatment. 
• To assess the relationship between changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profiles over time and clinical outcomes to treatment . 
Study Design: 
This is a Phase 1b, open -label  study with multiple treatment arms evaluating the PK, 
safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of rucaparib in combination with other 
anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171281]. The study is designed to test the combination 
of rucaparib with AR -directed therapy (enzalutamide [Arm A] and abiraterone [Arm B]). 
Each arm consists of an initial PK , safety and tolerability  assessment . Once completed, 
additional patients may be evaluated to better characterize the P K, safety/tolerability and 
preliminary efficacy of the combination  in an expansion phase. 
Patients participating in this study will enroll into one of the study arms (in either the PK 
assessment phase or the expansion phase). If a patient appears to be eli gible for more than 
one treatment arm that is open to enrollment, the investigator will be responsible for selecting the most appropriate treatment arm for the patient. However, enrollment into 
Arm A will be prioritized over Arm B until the objectives for Arm  A have been achieved.  
[Rucaparib (CO-338)]   Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-[ADDRESS_200600] the PK  of rucaparib . This 
run-in period will occur both in the initial PK  phase as well as the expansion phase of the 
study.  
All dose level s of Arm A (enzalutamide  combination ) will use the approved dose of 
160 mg once a day ( QD) enzalutamide ; similarly, all dose levels of A rm B  (abiraterone  
combination) will use the approved dose of 1,000  mg QD abiraterone  along with 5 mg  BID 
prednisone. 
• In Arm A, based on the individual safety profiles of both rucaparib and enzalutamide, 
no significant overlap in toxicity is expected. Therefore, the approved monotherapy dose of each agent will be the starting dose for the initial combination evaluation.  
Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability and the dose of rucaparib 
may be reduced, if appropriate , based on emerging safety data.  Preliminary assessment 
of the metabolic profile of rucaparib and enzalutamide indicates that rucaparib 
exposure may be diminished due to cytochrome P450 ( CYP )3A4 induction by 
[CONTACT_171313]. Therefore, depending on the PK profile of rucaparib, and taking into account the emerging safety/tolerability data, the rucaparib dose may be escalated 
beyond the starting dose of 600 mg  BID. Rucaparib escalation, up to a maximum dose 
of 1,000 mg  BID ruc aparib , may be explored based on emerging PK, safety and 
tolerability data . The increase in rucaparib dose will be determined by [CONTACT_171314]. 
• In Arm B, the target combination doses will be the approved monotherapy dose s for 
abiraterone and rucaparib. It is not anticipated that abiraterone will reduce rucaparib 
exposure. However, t he dose of rucaparib may also be increased  beyond [ADDRESS_200601] dose of abiraterone may be explored.  
 
Up to 3 dose levels may be tested in the initial PK and safety/tolerability assessment phase, 
with a maximum of 6 patients in each dose level. Further assessment of PK,  
safety/tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination may be made in  an 
expansion phase, enrolling up to 12 patients per arm. 
Screening assessments will include demographics and medical history, prior treatments, 
prior and current medications and procedures, 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG), Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) performance status, hematology, laboratory  
chemistry, urinalysis, a baseline disease/tumor assessment by [CONTACT_20420] 
(CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/bone scan, PSA measurement, physical 
examination, height, weight, and vital signs measurements an d AE assessment. Archival 
tumor tissue , and preferably optiona l screening biopsies, will be collected, if available .

Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-107 Amendment 2  19 January 2022 
Confidential  Page 9 of 106 Samples for ctDNA and germline testing will be collected for exploratory assessments  
during the PK run-in period. PK  collection for both arms is  performed following a 1 -week 
run-in period with rucaparib alone. PK of rucaparib in combination with enzalutamide  in 
Arm A will be assessed over 2  cycles (one cycle is 28 days) due to the longer half- life of 
enzalutamide and its metabolites, while PK  of rucaparib  in combination with abiraterone 
will be assessed  over a single cycle (also 28 days) in Arm B. Samples collected for 
longitudinal ctDNA profiling and pharmacogenomics will be analy zed to evaluate  gene 
variants associated with the clinical activity and PK of the study drugs. 
As of the implementation of Protocol Amendment 2, d uring and at the end of treatment, 
patients will undergo a more limited number of assessments; however, an appropriate level 
of safety monitoring will remain in place . Patients will be monitored for AEs , but only 
serious adverse events ( SAEs ) and adverse events of special interest ( AESIs ) will be 
reported through [ADDRESS_200602] of care per investigator. 
Disease/tumor assessments and PSA measurements will be performed according to local 
standard of care per investigator.  The End-of-T reatment ( EOT ) Visit and the 28- day safety Follow-up V isit wil l include an 
assessment of  AEs. Any ongoing S AEs, AESIs , or treatment -related Grade  3/4 AEs will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization.  After the 28 -day Follow-up Visit, only SAEs 
assessed as potentially related to study drug  should be reported per Clovis 
Pharmacovigilance (PV) requirements and captured in the Clovis PV database.  
After the 28 -day Follow-up Visit, AESIs of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML), irrespective of causality, should be reported per Clovis PV 
requirements and captured in the Clovis PV database.  
• AESIs of pneumonitis or similar events (ie, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, acute interstitial pneumonitis, alveolitis necrotizing, alveolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and organizing pneumonia) should be reported up to, but not beyond, the  28-day Follow-up Visit (ie, [ADDRESS_200603] dose of study drug). 
After the 28 -day Follow-up Visit, only  serious pneumonitis or similar events assessed 
as potentially related to study drug  should be reported per Clovis Oncology PV 
requirements. 
Any drug modifications ( treatment interruption, dose modifications , and/or treatment 
discontinuation) will  be documented in the electronic C ase Report F orm ( eCRF ) and 
source documents, until the implementation of Protocol Amendment 2, after which it is no longer required to collect data in the eCRF . If a patient has radiologic progression, but 
continues to derive clinical benefit per the investigator, then continuation of treatment with the combination beyond progression may be requested by [CONTACT_1697]. In such cases, the decision to continue will be made jointly between the investigator and the sponsor (or designee), and the patient must consent prior to continuing treatment.

Confidential  Page 16 of 106 Efficacy Analysis:  
Confirmed ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented and confirmed 
best overall response of  complete response ( CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by 
[CONTACT_171317] /PCWG3 criteria . A confirmed CR or PR is a response 
that is maintained and documented on a subsequent tumor assessment no less than 4  weeks 
after initial response. ORR (confirmed CR + PR) will also be summarized with frequencies 
and percentages. Changes in PSA levels will also be summarized. The frequency and percentages of patients with a best overall response of CR,  PR, stable disease ( SD), or 
progressive disease ( PD) will be summarized. All summaries of response rate will be 
accompanied by 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Sparse b lood sampling for PK analyses of both rucaparib and the combination drug  partner 
will be conducted in all patients. The PK parameters will be determined using 
non-compartmental methods  and will be reported. Predose concentrations ( ie, minimum 
concentration during a dose interval [C
min]) of rucaparib, combination drug partners, and 
metabolites of interest (if any) will be reported. The effect of combination drug on the PK of rucaparib and its metabolite, M324, will be assessed by [CONTACT_171318] -state 
C
min with and without treatment of the combination drug in each arm. The 
M324- to-rucaparib steady -state C min ratio with and without treatment of the combination 
drug in each arm will also be determined.  
Dose Cohort Review Committee : 
This committee will include study investigators, the sponsor’s medical monitor, and may include other representatives or designees of the sponsor and the study sites. Prior to initiating treatment at each new dose level or prior to expanding a dose level , the 
committee will review patient data, including, but not limited to, demographics, PK 
results, study drug dosing, concomitant medications, hematology and serum chemistry, and AEs. The discussion and agreement to escalate or reduce the rucaparib dose and/ or expand 
an existing dose level will be documented.

A brief overview of data from nonclinical and clinical studies are provided below and described in detail in the rucaparib Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical  Experience  
The results from nonclinical studies are consistent with the mechanism of action and pharmacological effects of PARP inhibition.  
Pharmacological assessment demonstrated that rucaparib is a potent and selective inhibitor of 
PARP -1, PARP-2, and PARP -[ADDRESS_200647] and durable in vitro and in vivo activity in 
multiple BRCA1/2 mutant cell lines and xenograft models. Rucaparib was also active in a BRCA wild -type models, consistent with in vitro data suggesting that rucaparib is active in 
cells wit h other defects in HRR through synthetic lethality. In vitro screens suggested that 
rucaparib has a limited potential for off- target effects.  
In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, rucaparib demonstrated species-dependent oral 
bioavailability, moderate plasma protein binding, and large volumes of distribution in 
nonclinical species. As a P -glycoprotein (P- gp) and breast cancer resistant protein  (BCRP) 
substrate, rucaparib demonstrated minimal penetration of rucaparib -derived radioactivity 
through the blood- brain  barrier. In vitro data suggested slow metabolism by [CONTACT_9058] 
P450 (CYP) enzymes, with CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 contributing to the metabolism of rucaparib. Rucaparib was mainly excreted in feces in rats and dogs. Rucaparib reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A, and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and down-regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) and MATE2- K, a moderate inhibitor of organic 
cationic transporter 1 (OCT1) and may inhibit P -gp and BCRP in the gut. 
Oral dosing of rucaparib in single and repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs resulted in toxicity to the hematopoietic, lymphopoietic, and gastrointestinal systems. These toxicities were generally both reversible upon recovery and predictive of toxicities observed in patients. Rucaparib was shown t o be clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay 
suggesting potential genotoxicity in humans. Reproductive and development toxicity studies in rat showed that rucaparib caused maternal toxicity and was embryotoxic. Although no rucaparib -related  effects on sperm total count, density, motility, or morphology were 
identified, based on published studies, PARP inhibitors have the potential to impair spermatogenesis and reduce fertility .

Rucaparib is being evaluated in Phase 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_200648] evaluated (and continue to evaluate) patients with relapsed, high -grade ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary 
peritoneal c ancer in both the treatment and maintenance settings.  
Rucaparib is being evaluated as treatment for patients with mCRPC, both as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. 
Clinical pharmacology studies in patients with advanced solid tumors have evaluated 
rucaparib drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and mass balance and drug metabolism. Additional clinical pharmacology studies continue to characterize rucaparib DDIs, as well as rucaparib PK in special populations. 
Additional studies of rucaparib as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171285], prostate, and bladder cancers, as well as other tumors.  
Information regarding clinical studies with rucaparib is available in the  IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Overview of Pharmacokinetics and Drug-drug Interactions  
Assessment of rucaparib PK in cancer patients showed an approximate dose proportional exposure after once a day (QD) or BID dosing, rapid absorption with maximum concentration  (C
max) achieved within 1.5 to 6 hours. The oral bioavailability was 36% and 
half- life (t1/2) was approximately 24  hours. Rucaparib was moderately bound to human 
plasma proteins in vitro (70%).  
At a dose of 600 mg  BID rucaparib, steady state was achieved after approximately 1  week 
with approximately 4 -fold accumulation. A high- fat meal increased the C max and area under 
the concentration -time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0-24) of rucaparib by 20% and 38%, 
respectively, as compared with that under fasted conditions. The effect of food on rucapa rib 
PK is not considered to be clinically significant, thus rucaparib can be taken with or without 
food. 
In vitro, rucaparib showed slow enzymatic turnover in human liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes. Recombinant CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP 3A4, were able 
to metabolize rucaparib. In cancer patients, M324, a carboxylic acid, was a major inactive metabolite of rucaparib.  
Drug interactions with rucaparib as a substrate were assessed in a population PK (PPK) analysis. CYP2D6 phenotypes (poor meta bolizers, intermediate metabolizers, normal 
metabolizers, and ultrarapid metabolizers) and CYP1A2 phenotypes (normal metabolizers and hyper-inducers) did not significantly impact the steady- state exposure of rucaparib at 
[ADDRESS_200649] that CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 play limited role in rucaparib metabolism. Although in vitro rucaparib

In another DDI study (Study CO-338- 095) in cancer patients, effects of rucaparib on oral 
rosuvastatin as BCRP substrate and oral contraceptives were determined following 14 days of dosing at 600 mg  BID. Rucaparib weakly inhibited BCRP  and caused mild increases in 
plasma exposures to ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. 
In Study CO-338-078, PK of a single dose of rucaparib was compared between cancer 
patients with normal hepatic function and moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment showed approximately 46% increase in  area under the

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Overview of Efficacy  
Rucaparib was originally approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) in December  2016 as monotherapy treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation 
(germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with ≥ [ADDRESS_200651]  v1.1, with ORR by [CONTACT_171325] a supportive analysis. ORR by [CONTACT_171326] 53.8%, while ORR by [CONTACT_171327] 41.5%, confirming the results of investigator 
assessment for this endpoint .
30 Responses were durable, indicated by a duration of response 
(DOR) by [CONTACT_171328] 9.2  months.  
In April 2018, rucaparib was approved by [CONTACT_171329], FTC, or PPC w ho are in a complete or partial response to 
platinum- based chemotherapy .
31 This approval was based on Study CO-338-014 (ARIEL3), 
a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study.

a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) -associated mCRPC who have been 
treated with AR-directed therapy and a taxane -based chemotherapy . The  approval was based 
on Study CO-338-052 (TRITON2), for which the primary outcome measure was ORR by

mild to moderate (Grade 1 -2) in severity and included gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain), asthenia/fatigue, anemia/decreased hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, decreased appetite, and dysgeusia. The most common TEAE ≥  Grade  3 include 
anemia/decreased hemoglobin, ALT/AST increased, neutropenia/decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and asthenia/fatigue. Section 6.6 of the rucaparib IB serves as guidance to the investigator on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for rucaparib, based on 
incidence of TEAEs by [CONTACT_171333] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grades and by ≥  Grade 3. 
The laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the TEAEs, with decreased hemoglobin 
(and associated increase in mean corpuscular volume [MCV] and mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH]), increased ALT, increased AST, and i ncreased serum creatinine, most 
commonly occurring. Decreased platelets, neutrophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes and increased cholesterol were observed to a lesser extent. The transient elevations in ALT/AST with rucaparib treatment were not associated with abnormal increases in bilirubin or other criteria for drug -induced hepatotoxicity and generally resolved over time. Furthermore, no 
cases met Hy’s law criteria for drug -induced liver injury (DILI),
32, 33 and few patients 
discontinued rucaparib due to ALT/AST elevations.34, 35 Similarly, elevations in creatinine 
were self -limiting and generally stabilized over time. The majority of creatinine elevations 
were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Elevated serum creatinine levels resolved upon interruption or discontinuation of rucaparib were not accompanied by [CONTACT_171334] (BUN) and did not lead to discontinuation of rucaparib treatment. Increased creatinine with rucaparib treatment is likely due to the potent inhibition by [CONTACT_171335]1 and MATE2 -K renal transporters ( Secti on [IP_ADDRESS]).

Confidential  Page 33 of 106 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are considered 
adverse events of special interest (AESI), as t hese events have been observed in patients 
exposed to cytotoxic chemotherapy (eg, platinum and anthracyclines) used for treatment of ovarian cancer as well as with PARP inhibitors, including rucaparib. Patients in rucaparib clinical studies diagnosed with MDS or AML had significant confounding risk factors including prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, and in some cases a deleterious BRCA mutation , 
which increases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_50876](s) . Based on these confounding factors, there is 
insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that MDS and AML are causally related to rucaparib. More information on AESIs experienced by [CONTACT_171337]. 
Adverse events (AEs) of pneumonitis have been reported with PARP inhibitor treatment, 
including in clinical trials evaluating rucaparib. Currently, however, there is a lack of understanding of a mechanistic link between pneumonitis and PARP inhibitor treatment, and causality assessment is often confounded by [CONTACT_171338] a consistent clinical pattern as well as other pre-disposing factors, such as cancer and/or metastases in lungs, underlying pulmonary disease, smoking history, and/or previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Clovis is seeking to understand whether or not there is a relationship betw een pneumonitis and rucaparib 
treatment; thus, Clovis is designating pneumonitis as an AESI to gather data to enable a thorough evaluation and assessment of the event and associated terms specified in 
Section  8.7. Also, refer to the rucaparib IB for information regarding the AESI of

1.1.2 Enzalutamide 
Enzalutamide is a next -generation anti- androgen that acts on multi ple steps of AR signaling 
within prostate cancer tumor cells.
20 It is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
castration -resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) , that develops after patients are treated with 
luteinizing hormone- releasing hormone ( LHRH) therapy. Further details about enzalutamide, 
including clinical efficacy, are available in the prescribing information .19 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview of Pharmacokinetics  
Following oral administration of enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC , the time to 
maximum concentration (t max) was 1 h our. The steady -state of enzalutamide  was reached 
after 28  days dosing with 8.3-fold accumulation. Enzalutamide showed approximately dose 
proportional steady-state PK over the daily dose range of 30 to 360 mg.  
Enzalutamide is primarily eliminated by [CONTACT_171339]. N- desmethyl enzalutamide is a 
major active metabolite. The C max values of enzalutamide and N- desmethyl enzalutamide 
were 16.6 µg/mL and 12.7 µg/mL, respectively. The terminal half- lives were approximately 
5.8 days for enzalutamide and 7.8 to 8.6 days for N-desmethyl enzalutamide. A high- fat meal 
did not alter the area under the concentration- time curve ( AUC) of enzalutamide or 
N-desmethyl enzalutamide. Enzalutamide can be dosed with or without food. Based on clinical DDI studies, co- administration of strong CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil 
increased the AUC of enzalutamide plus its active metabolite N -desmethyl enzalutamide  by

Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-107 Amendment 2  19 January 2022 
Confidential  Page 34 of 106 2.2-fold. Co-administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C8 
inducer, decreased the AUC of enzalutamide and N -desmethyl enzalutamide by 37%. Strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitors and strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided. Enzalutamide is a 
strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer. Concomitant use of enzalutamide with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 should be avoided. 
Effect of organ dysfunction on PK was evaluated in a population PK analysis. The apparent 
clearance (CL/F) of enzalutamide was similar in subjects with pre -existing mild and 
moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [ CrCL ] 30 to < 90 mL/min) compared to 
subjects with normal renal function (CrCL  ≥ 90 mL/min). The composite AUC of 
enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl enzalutamide was similar in subjects with mild, moderate, or 
severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.   
No clinically significant PK covariates have been identified.  
The effect of enzalutamide 160  mg QD on the QT  interval corrected for heart rate  (QTc) was 
evaluated in patients with mCRPC. No large QTc prolongation was observed (ie, greater than 20 ms ), but small increases (ie, < 10 ms) due to enzalutamide cannot be excluded. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview of Efficacy  
The efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in 4 ,692 patients with CRPC were demonstrated in 
4 randomized, multicenter clinical studies : AFFIRM, PREVAIL, TERRAIN and PROSPER . 
All patients continued on gonadotropin releasing hormone ( GnRH) therapy or had prior 
bilateral orchiectomy. Patients were allowed, but not required, to continue or initiate glucocorticoids. Further details are available in the prescribing information.

[IP_ADDRESS] Over view of Safety  
Seizure occurred in 0.4% of patients receiving enzalutamide. In patients with predisposing factors, seizures were reported in 2.2% of patients. There have been reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving enzalutamide. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_171286], headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. Hypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed in the clinical studies with 
pharyngeal edema seen in postmarketing cases. Patients receiving enzalutamide also had a higher rate of isc hemic heart disease as well as falls and fractures. The most common adverse 
reactions are asthenia/fatigue, decreased appetite, hot flush, arthralgia, dizziness/vertigo, hypertension, headache, and weight decrease. Further details including management of these adverse effects are available in the prescribing information .

1.1.3 Abiraterone 
Abiraterone is a n inhibitor of 17α -hydroxylase/C17,20- lyase (CYP17), an enz yme expressed 
in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues, which is required for androgen biosynthesis. The blockade of nongonadal androgen production is a key factor in treating

combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with mCRPC and metastatic 
high- risk castration -sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).21 The addition of prednisone is to 
prevent mineralocorticoid excess- related AEs  (such as hypertension, hypokalemia and fluid 
retention), resulting from CYP17 inhibition.22 Further details about abiraterone, including 
clinical efficacy, are available in the prescribing information .21 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview of Pharmacokinetics  
Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate at 1 ,000 mg QD to patients with 
mCRPC, the steady -state C max was 226 ng/mL and the AUC was 993 ng hr/mL  with a 2-fold 
accumulation. Further increase of dose to 2 ,000 mg resulted in minimal increase (8%) in 
AUC.  
Significant food effect on PK was observed. In healthy subjects, a low- fat meal (7% fat, 
300 calories) increased abiraterone C max and AUC by 7- and 5- fold, respec tively ; while a 
high- fat meal (25% fat, 491 calories) increased Cmax and AUC by 17- and 5-fold, 
respectively. When abiraterone acetate was dosed [ADDRESS_200655] 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.   
Abiraterone has high plasma protein binding (> 99%)  and large apparent steady- state volume 
of distribution. At clinical exposures, abiraterone acetate and abiraterone are not P- gp 
substrates; abiraterone acetate is a P -gp inhibitor. 
After oral administration, abiraterone acetate is hydrolyzed to the active metabolite abiraterone, which is further metabolized to 2 inactive metabolites abiraterone sulphate and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate. The formation of abiraterone is likely mediated  by [CONTACT_132288], 
and CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are responsible for the subsequent N-oxidation and formation of sulphat e metabolites.  
In patients with mCRPC, the t
1/2 of abiraterone in plasma is approximately 12 hours. 
Following an oral dose of 14C-abraterone acetat e, approximately 88% of the radioactive dose 
was recovered in feces and approximately 5% in urine. 
Subjects with mild (Child -Pugh A), moderate (Child -Pugh B), and severe (Child- Pugh  C) 
hepatic impairment showed 1.1, 3.6, and 7- fold increase s in systemic ex posure to 
abiraterone , respectively,  compared to  subjects with normal hepatic function following a 
single oral dose of 1 ,000 mg abiraterone acetate. Patients with end -stage renal disease on 
hemodialysis showed no apparent PK difference than patients with normal renal function.  
In vitro studies showed that abiraterone has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6 
CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5. Clinically, the C max and 
AUC of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 substrate, increased by 2.8- and 2.9-fold,

Confidential  Page 36 of 106 respectively, when co- administered with 1 ,000 mg abiraterone acetate daily. However, no 
clinical inhibition of CYP1A2 was observed when theophylline was used as a CYP1A2 DDI 
probe. Abiraterone is a CYP3A4 substrate. While co- administration of ketoconazole (a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) showed no effect on abiraterone PK, a 55% decrease in mean abiraterone AUC was observed when abiraterone acetate was co -administered with rifampin 
(a strong CYP3A4 inducer). Abiraterone was a weak CYP2C8 inhibitor and increased the 
AUC of pi[INVESTIGATOR_171287] 46%. 
The QT prolongation potential was assessed following abiraterone 1,000 mg QD in patients 
with mCRPC. No large change in the QTc interval from baseline (ie, >  20 ms), however, 
small increases in the QTc interval (ie, <  10 ms) due to abiraterone acetate cannot be 
excluded. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview of Efficacy  
Abiraterone was tested in a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study with a total of 
1,195 mCRPC patients to demonstrate its superiority over placebo with a 57% reduction in 
the risk of radiographic progression or death ( HR 0.43; 95% CI: 0.35 to  0.52; p < 0.001) and 
an estimated 25% decrease in the risk of death ( HR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.93; p = 0.009).12, 
36 Additional details are provided in the prescribing information.21, 37  
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview of Safety  
Abiraterone may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition, and therefore should be used with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Co -administration of a 
corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive, resulting in a reduction in the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions. Adrenocortical insufficiency has been reported in clinical studies  in patients receiv ing abiraterone  in 
combination with prednisone, following interruption of daily steroids and/or with concurrent infection or stress.  Marked increases in liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation or 
dosage modification have occurred in clinical studies with abiraterone. Aside from these, the most common side effects were joint swelling or discomfort, hypokalemia, edema, muscle discomfort, hot flush, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, cough, hypertension, arrhythmia, 
urinary frequency, nocturia, dyspepsia, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. Additional 
details are provided in the prescribing information .21  
1.2 Study Rationale  
The study will initially evaluate the combinations of rucaparib with  2 widely used 
AR-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], enzalutamide and abiraterone. Subsequent arms of the study may 
include other combination partners (eg, AR inhibitors in development or immune modulators such as checkpoint inhibitors).  The primary goal of this study is to investigate potential DDI 
and safety/tolerability in the 2 combinations, and also preliminary efficacy. The outcome of these studies will be used to support larger studies to investigate these combinations in mCRPC.

Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-107 Amendment 2  19 January 2022 
Confidential  Page 37 of 106 1.2.1 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Patients  
While there is scientific rationale and clinical precedence of benefit for the  combination of 
PARPi [CONTACT_119495]- directed therapy , as elucidated above, the combination of rucaparib with 
either enzalutamide or abiraterone has not been previously tested and thus clinical benefit of 
these combinations has not been established . In this trial,  both enzalutamide and abiraterone 
will be administered  at their approved monotherapy doses. The startin g dose of rucaparib 
(further detailed in Section 1.2.3) in each arm has been chosen based on review of the 
individual agent safety profiles, with an aim towards minimizing overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685] . 
Escalation of rucaparib dose will take into account safety and tolerability observed at prior 
dose levels.  
1.2.2 Rationale for the Study Design  
The primary objectives for this study are to evaluate the PK , safety and tolerability of 
rucaparib in combination with other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171288].  
The study is therefore divided into an initial PK assessment  phase, which also evaluates 
safety/tolerability in addition to PK, and a dose expansion phase to further characterize PK and safety/tolerability  if needed. The PK assessment will incorporate a run- in phase of 
rucaparib alone in the first week, in order to assess the impact on rucaparib PK once the combination partner is also introduced. 
In Arm A, based on the individual safety profiles of both rucaparib and enzalutamide, no 
significant overlap in toxicity is expected. Therefore, the approved monotherapy dose of each agent will be the starting dose for the initial combination evaluation.  Patients will be closely 
monitored for safety and tolerability and the dose of rucaparib may be reduced, if appropriate, based on emerging safety data. Preliminary assessment of the metabolic profile of rucaparib and enzalutamide indicates that rucaparib exposure may be diminished due to CYP3A4 induction by [CONTACT_171313] (detailed in Section 1.2.3). Therefore, depending on the 
PK profile of rucaparib, and taking into account the emerging safety/tolerability data, 
rucaparib dose may be escalated beyo nd the starting dose of 600 mg BID. Rucaparib 
escalation, up to a maximum dose of 1 ,000 mg BID rucaparib, may be explored based on 
emerging PK, safety and tolerability data. The potential increase in rucaparib dose will be proportional to the decrease in exposure (relative to expected exposure for monotherapy) seen at the previous dose level.  
In Arm B, the target combination doses will be the approved monotherapy doses for 
abiraterone and rucaparib. However, as there is potential for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_171289] (detailed in Section 1.2.3) , the initial starting dose for rucaparib will be 
[ADDRESS_200656] 
dose of abiraterone may be explored. In the event that there is unexpected lower exposure of rucaparib with co-administration of abiraterone, the dose of rucaparib may be increased beyond 600 mg  BID, similar to the approach outlined for Arm A.  
[Rucaparib (CO-338)]   Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-107 Amendment 2  19 January 2022 
Confidential  Page 38 of 106 Dose escalation or de- escalation  strategy for both Arms A and B is further detailed in 
Section  3.3.  
Once a safe and tolerable dose combination is established , for both Arm A and Arm B, PK  
and safety/tolerability  characterization  may be conducted with up to 12 additional patients  in 
the dose expansion phase, particularly if PK in the initial PK assessment  phase is variable or 
additional safety information is required.  
1.2.3 Dose Rationale  
Dose determination in each arm of the study will be performed as described in Section  3.3. 
All patients in Arm A will receive e nzalutamide at 160 mg  QD and all patients in Arm B will 
receive abiraterone at 1,000 mg QD with 5  mg prednisone BID. Starting dose of rucaparib is 
600 mg  BID in Arm  A and 400 mg  BID in Arm  B.  
Arm A:   
In vitro, rucaparib is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6, and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and 
CYP3A4.  Enzalutamide is a strong clinical inducer of CYP3A4,[ADDRESS_200657] dose cohort at the full doses of rucaparib and 
enzalutamide is the long t 1/2 of enzalutamide (5.8 days) and its active metabolite N -desmethyl 
enzalutamide (7.8  to 8.6 days). The plasma exposure of enzalutamide and N -desmethyl 
enzalutamide increase slowly following enzalutamide treatment, and it takes approximately 40 days to reach the steady state. Therefore , any exacerbation of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_171290].  
Enzalutamide starting dose will be fixed at  the approved dose of 160 mg  QD. No dose 
adjustment is  planned for the starting dose of enzalutamide.  
Arm B:  
Abiraterone administration is not expected to have any impact on rucaparib  exposure. 
However, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) , nausea, 
vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y tract infections  have been reported in 
patients receiving abiraterone, as well as for patients receiving rucaparib. A conservative 
starting dose of rucaparib 400 mg  BID (~  67% of approved starting dose) and the approved 
starting dose of abiraterone 1 ,000 mg  QD are selected for initiation of Arm  B in the dose 
escalation phase.  
Abiraterone acetate starting dose will be fixed at the approved dose of 1,000  mg QD. No 
adjustment is  planned for the starting dose of abiraterone acetate.

Confidential  Page 39 of 106 1.2.4 Rationale for Duration of Treatment  
Patients will be on study as long as they benefit from the study treatment or unless they 
withdraw from study. 
A 1-week run- in period with rucaparib alone prior to the start of combination therapy allows 
for the assessment of rucaparib PK in the absence of either enzalutamide or abiraterone in 
Arms  A and B respectively.  
In Arm A, the dose- limiting toxicity (DLT ) window is 8 weeks ( Cycle s 1 and 2). This is 
justified as enzalutamide and its major active metabolite N -desmethyl enzalutamide have 
long half- lives. Evaluation and assessment over an 8- week  period will allow  for adequate PK 
and DLT assessments.  
In Arm B, due to the shorter t1/2 of abiraterone, a 4 -week period is expected to suffice for 
assessment of PK and  DLTs.

This is a Phase 1b, open -label, platform study with multiple treatment arms evaluating the 
PK, DDIs, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of rucaparib in combination with a 
second anticancer therapy in patients with mCRPC. Each arm consists of a preliminary phase designed to assess PK and safety and tolerability of rucaparib in combination with other anticancer agents, followed by [CONTACT_171342] (if needed) to further evaluate PK, safety, 
tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination . 
3.1 Screening Period  
All mCRPC patients will undergo screening assessments between Day - 28 and Day -1 after 
they sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) and prior to any study- specific procedures being 
performed.  
Refer to th e inclusion/exclusion criteria (Secti on 4.2 and Section  4.3) for details.  
3.2 Enrollment  
Eligible patients will be enrolled into the PK assessment phase or the dose expansion phase 
(after a combination dose is established) across the treatment arms. If a patient appears to be eligible for more than one treatment arm that is open to enrollment, the investigator will be responsible for selecting the treatment arm for the patient. However, enrollment into Arm A will be prioritized over Arm B until the objective s for Arm A have been achieved . No patient 
randomization is planned.  
3.3 Treatment Period  
As of the implementation of Protocol Amendment 2, during and at the end of treatment, a more limited number of assessments will be performed compared to previously; however, an appropriate level of safety monitoring will remain in place. A revised Schedule of Assessments (SOA) is provided in Section  7.1; this  replaces all prior SOAs and should be 
followed for all patients who remain on treatment.  
During the treatment phase (continuous 28- day treatment cycles), patients will be monitored  
for safety and efficacy. Assessments during the treatment phase will include AEs, complete blood count (monthly assessment advised), and study drug administration/accountability; in addition, disease assessments (imaging/ PSA), clinical chemistry, urinalys is, and vital signs 
will be performed per local standard of care practices. Disease/tumor assessments per mRECIST/PCWG3 criteria will be performed according to local standard of care per investigator.  
Patients  starting on the study in either the PK assessment phase or the dose expansion phase 
will be administered rucaparib alone for 1 week . After completing  this run-in period, they 
will immediately begin  continuous 28- day treatme nt cycles of rucaparib and the combination 
drug.

Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-107 Amendment 2  19 January 2022 
Confidential  Page 42 of 106 PK Assessment  Phase:  
Doses of rucaparib may be modified in this phase from the starting dose; however, the dose 
of its combination partner (either enzalutamide in Arm A or abiraterone co -administered with 
prednisone in Arm  B) will remain fixed.  
Arm A: Six patients will be enrolled at the standard monotherapy dose of enzalutamide and starting dose of rucaparib of 600 mg  BID. If no significant PK interaction is observed and 
safety and tolerability is within acceptable guidelines ( Section 5.6), no further dose titration 
will be done. However, if PK interactions indicate the concentration of rucaparib is 25% to  50% of the expected rucaparib exposure in monotherapy, then a higher dose of 
rucaparib will be considered, to a maximum dose of 1,000 mg  BID, also taking safety and 
tolerability into account . The increase in dose will be scaled to be proportional to the 
decrease in expected exposure.  In the event ≥ 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT  (as defined 
in Section  5.6), a lower dose of rucaparib may be explored, with subsequent dose cohorts 
enrolling a minimum of 3  patients and a maximum of 6 patients, unless the rucaparib dose is 
at the minimal dose of 300  mg BID.  
Arm B: Three patients will be enrolled at the starting dose of [ADDRESS_200658] monotherapy dose of abiraterone . If there is no DLT ( as 
defined in Section 5.6 ) observed in any of these 3 patients , the next higher dose of 
600 mg  BID rucaparib will be explored. If one patient develops a DLT, the cohort will be 
expanded to 6 patients. If DLTs are observed in ≥ [ADDRESS_200659] dose of abiraterone may be explored. The dose of rucaparib may also be increased  beyond 600 mg BID if there is unexpected lower exposure 
with co -administration of abiraterone , similar to the approach outlined for Arm A. Each dose 
cohort in this arm will enroll a minimum of 3 patients and a maximum of 6  patients.  
Prior to initiating treatment at each new combined dose level or prior to expanding an existing dose level, a teleconference with the Dose Cohort Review Comm ittee (Section  3.6) 
will be held to review patient data .  
The combination dose for evaluation in the expansion phase will be selected based on overall safety and tolerability, PK, as well as any efficacy  observed.  
Disease/tumor assessments and PSA measurements will be  performed according to local 
standard of care per investigator. Any drug modifications (interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation) should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF , see 
Section 10.5 ) and source documents.  
Patients will receive rucaparib and the combination drug until confirmed radiologic disease progression assessed by [CONTACT_171343]/PCWG3  (Appendix 1), unequivocal 
clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or inability to tolerate further treatment, loss to follow -up; or withdrawal of consent. PSA rise without evidence of confirmed 
radiologic progression is strongly discouraged as a criterion to start a new systemic

start a new systemic antineoplasti c therapy throughout the study. Palliative radiation for 
treatment of painful bony metastases and initiation of bisphosphonates or other approved bone-targeting agents are allowed and should not result in discontinuation of study drug therapy. 
Sparse PK samples will be collected from all patients for assessments of PK and DDIs  
(Table  7-2).  
Expansion Phase:  
Once the optimal combination dose has been provisionally determined, up to 12 additional 
patients may be enrolled and treated at that dose combination to further characterize PK, safety and tolerability, in order to establish that this is the optimal dose combination for 
future clinical s tudies.  
Pharmacokinetics and Drug -Drug Interaction Assessment : 
In both the initial PK assessment phase as well as the expansion phase, PK assessment will start with a 1-week  run- in period, during which patients  will receive rucaparib treatment 
only. Predose rucaparib PK samples at selected timepoints will be collected. This will be followed by [CONTACT_171344] 28- day treatment 
cycles, with predose PK samples collected for rucaparib and the combination drug at selected 
timepoints.

drugs.  
3.6 Dose Cohort Review  Committee  
This committee will include study investigators, the sponsor’s medical monitor, and may include other representatives or designees of the sponsor and the study sites. It will be responsible for review ing safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy data at regular intervals 
throughout the study. Prior to initiating treatment at a new dose level or expanding a dose level, a safety teleconference will be held to review patient data, incl uding, but not limited to, 
demographics, PK results, study drug dosing, concomitant medications, hematology and serum chemistry, and AEs.  The discussion and agreement to escalate or reduce the rucaparib 
dose and/or expand an existing dose level will be documented.

• Progression of patient’s underlying cancer per mRECIST and/or PCWG3 criteria  as 
assessed by [CONTACT_093], unless the patient continues to derive clinical benefit from the study drug(s) according to the investigator, the investigator has consulted with the sponsor’s medical officer or designee, and the patient has provided additional consent  for 
treatment be yond progression at the next study visit;  
• Any event, adverse or otherwise, that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would pose an unacceptable safety risk to the patient . If it is determined that one of the study drugs in 
the combination is posing a safety risk and that study drug is permanently discontinued, administration of the other study drug may continue if none of the other withdrawal

receive benefit ; 
• Any concomitant illness that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would affect assessments of the clinical status to a significant degree and requires discontinuation of therapy;  
• Noncompliance by [CONTACT_171316]- mandated procedures;  or  
• The study is terminated . 
 
Discontinuation of treatment does not necessarily indicate study discontinuation for a patient. 
Samples collected for research will continue to be used unless the patient explicitly withdraws consent for their use. The sponsor will store samples for up to 7 years after the 
study is over and any remaining samples w ill be destroyed at that time. Information that is  
collected while the patient has consented to be in the study cannot be withdrawn. Details are provided in the ICF.  
If the patient withdraws consent to continue in the study or discontinues the study for another reason it will be documented on the appropriate eCRF (see Section 10.5 ). A patient may 
withdraw consent to participate in an additional or optional part of a study that has a corresponding consent (ie, optional tumor biopsy) yet continue to participate and be treated/followed in the main part of the study.  
The sponsor may discontinue the study  early for any of the reasons noted in Sect ion 10.6.

The abiraterone acetate tablets should be swallowed whole without crushing or chewing.  Abiraterone acetate  will be provided as 250 and 500  mg dose strength tablets ( Sectio n 5.1.3). 
5.6 Dose -Limiting Toxicit ies 
A DLT is defined according to criteria specified below  and assessed by [CONTACT_093], 
based on toxicity grade (according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0), clinical significance, and 
possible relationship to the study drug combination (refer to Section  8.7.4 for consideration 
of causal relationship). The toxicity should not be a recognized adverse effect of enzalutamide, abiraterone or prednisone/prednisolone and/or attributable to mCRPC or mCRPC- related processes under investigation.  
The DLT- evaluation period for the determination of dose escalation is the first 2 cycles of 
rucaparib combination treatment (56 days) for Arm A and the first cycle of rucaparib combination treatment (28  days) for Arm B.  
DLTs are  defined as: 
• Grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia (ie, fever >  38.3°C with ANC < 1.0 × 109/L) of any 
duration or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_171292]-colony stimulating factor (GCSF ) administration ; 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <  50 × 109/L) with significant bleeding or Grade  4 
thrombocytopenia (platelets <  25 × 109/L) ≥  5 days duration; 
• Grade 4 anemia (ie, life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated); 
• Any nonhematological AE ≥  Grade 3, with the exception of: 
- Nausea,  vomiting, and diarrhea well controlled by [CONTACT_171347] ≤  72 hours; 
- Fatigue; 
- Grade [ADDRESS_200689]. Note: any Grade 4 ALT/AST is a DLT;  
- Grade 3 arthralgia treate d with non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drug(s) (or 
equivalent) that resolves to ≤  Grade  2 within 14 days ;

3 consecutive assessments) or Grade 4 QTc prolongation (Torsade de pointes, 
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia ) (Specific 
to Arm B) . 
 
5.7 Definition of DLT -evaluable Patient  
For Arm A of the study, in order to be considered evaluable for dose escalation/de- escalation 
decisions, a patient must have received at least 70% of the scheduled doses of both rucaparib  
and enzalutamide and completed [ADDRESS_200690] experienced a DLT in either 
Cycle  1 or Cycle 2. If a patient withdraws from the study without having met either of these 
criteria, then an additional patient will be enrolled in that cohort; however, safety data, including AEs for that patient will also be considered in dose escalation decisions.  
For Arm B of the study, in order to be considered evaluable for dose escalation/de- escalation 
decisions, a patient must have received at least 80% of the scheduled doses of both rucaparib 
and abiraterone and completed Cycle [ADDRESS_200691] experienced a DLT in Cycle 1. If a patient withdraws from the study without having met either of these criteria, then an additional patient will be enrolled in that cohort; however, safety data, including AEs for that patient will also be considered in dose escalation decisions.  
5.8 Dose Modifications of Protocol -specified Treatment  
5.8.1 Rucaparib Dose Modification Criteria 
Doses of rucaparib may be interrupted or delayed for toxicity and other protocol- specified 
criteria. Dose reductions are permitted for rucaparib . The assessment for delay or 
discontinuation should be made separately for rucaparib and its combination partner; however, if toxicity is considered related to all study drugs or if the investigator is unable to determine which study drug is the cause of the AE, then all study drugs in the combination should be delayed and/or discontinued. Treatment may be discontinued due to withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or termination of the study, whichever occurs first.  
Dose modification and retreatment of rucaparib are to be ba sed on the criteria presented in 
Table  5-4.

to hematologist and analysis of the bone marrow with cytogenetic studies and recommended according to 
standard  practice. Bone marrow analysis should include a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (for cellular morphology, 
cytogenetic analysis, and flow cytometry) and a core biopsy (for bone marrow cellularity).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of New or Worsening Pulmonary Symptoms  
If new or worsening unexplained pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonitis 
(including, but not limited to, dyspnea) occur, or a deterioration of pulmonary function is observed, and/or radiologic abnormality is detected in the lungs, and this occurs in the absence of any clear diagnosis, a diagnostic workup (including high resolution computed 
tomography [ CT] scan) in consultation with a pulmonologist should be performed in order to 
rule out pneumonitis. During this time, treatment with rucaparib may be interrupted or 
continued per investigator discretion. 
Following investigation, if pneumonitis is not  confirmed, treatment with rucaparib may be 
resumed/continued as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_171349]. All confirmed events of pneumonitis should be treated as appropriate per medical judg ment and institutional guidelines. If the 
event resolves and retreatment with rucaparib is being considered, please consult the sponsor’s m edical monitor. Retreatment with rucaparib may be resumed at the current or a 
reduced dose, if appropriate.  
Refer to Sections 8.3 and 8.7 of the protocol for additional information regarding 
classification and reporting of pneumonitis (and similar events ) as an AESI.  
5.8.2 Rucaparib Dose Modification Steps  
Dose reduction steps are presented in  Table  5-5. Dose reduction steps from a starting dose of 
greater than 600 mg BID will be determined and agreed upon by [CONTACT_171350], based on the starting dose, exposure of rucaparib achieved and toxicities observed in prior dose level cohort(s). 
Dose escalation upon resolution of toxicity to ≤  CTCAE Grade  1 is permitted at the 
discretion of the investigator.   
If rucaparib PK is decreased by 25- 50% due to interactions with its combination partner, 
(particularly in Arm A), it may be necessary to escalate the dose of rucaparib from 
600 mg  BID to a maximum of 1 ,000 mg BID . The increase in rucaparib dose will be 
determined by [CONTACT_171351].

Arm B: Discontinuation of abiraterone and/or modification of abiraterone may be warranted (refer to the prescribing information) if the patient exhibits symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess, adren ocortical insufficiency or hepatotoxicity.  
5.9 Treatment Compliance  
As of the implementation of Protocol Amendment 2, the requirement to use drug dosing 
diaries will be discontinued , and compliance and dosing data are no longer required to be 
entered in  the eCRF (see Section  10.5). 
Study site  personnel will review dosing information with the patient (or legally authorized 
representative , where acceptable) on scheduled clinic visit days, providing instructions 
regarding dose, dose frequency and the number of tablets to be taken for each dose. Patients (or legally authorized representative , where acceptable according to local regulations ) will be 
instructed to k eep all unused containers (empty, partially used, and/or unopened) for 
accountability at scheduled clinic visits. Documentation of dosing will be recorded in a 
study-specific dosing diary provided by [CONTACT_456] (or designee). D osing noncompliance is 
defin ed as a patient missing > 14 days of study drug within a cycle for 2 consecutive cycles 
for reasons other than toxicity. The sponsor may require patients meeting noncompliance 
criteria to discontinue study treatment.

Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-[ADDRESS_200696] compliance information on the eCRF  
(see Section  10.5). Additional details regarding study drug dispensation and return can be 
found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Every effort should be made to ensure patients return all study drug containers/unused study 
drugs at the end of each cycle of treatment . Study site pers onnel should conduct a verbal 
review of dosing with the patient and document the discussion in the patient’s medical record. This documentation may serve as source documentation for entering dosing data on 
the appropriate eCRF  (see Section 10.5). 
5.10 Accountability of Protocol -specified Treatment  
Study site personnel will maintain accurate records of study drug receipt, dispensation, use, return, destruction, and reconcil iation for study drugs provided by [CONTACT_456]. The IWRS  
will be used to manage study drug inventory at all sites. T o function properly, the system will 
require real -time entry of study drug receipt, dispensation, destruction, etc. by [CONTACT_171352]. 
The site is responsible for the return or destruction of study drug supplied by [CONTACT_456], as 
required. Authorization for on- site destruction of study drug that has not been dispensed to a 
patient (eg, expi[INVESTIGATOR_143187]), must be requested from the sponsor prior to destruction. All 
study drug containers must be accounted for prior to their de struction at the study site , 
according to institutional procedures for disposal of hazardous mater ials. Unused and 
returned study drug product and containers should be destroyed on- site if possible. If on- site 
destruction is not possible, supply should be returned to the drug depot, following the sponsor’s instructions . 
During the study and at completion of the study, the number of study drug units and containers received, dispensed, returned, and destroyed must be recorded and reconciled. Additional details regarding study drug accountability can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.

request to discontinue, death, initiation of any other anticancer therapy, or termination of the study ( refer to Section  10.6).  
If a patient receiving study drug s has met criteria for confirmed radiologic disease 
progression by [CONTACT_143900]/PCWG3 , but the patient continues to derive clinical benefit per the 
investigator,  then continuation of study drug(s) may be permitted upon discussion with the 
medical monitor. In such cases, the documented decision to continue will be made jointly between the investigator and the sponsor (or designee), it must be documented in the patient’s chart, and the patient must provide consent within a reasonable timeframe of the 
documented decision to continue study treatment. Clinical scenarios where continuation of study drugs after radiographic progression may be considered include, but are n ot limited to :

symptoms remain well controlled; 2)  a patient who experiences progression in a site of 
disease that is unlikely to adversely affect prognosis (eg, enlargement of a solitary lymph 
node); or 3) a patient with general disease control, but limited progression in sites of disease 
that can be managed with local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171293]. Patients continuing to receive study drug(s) will continue to have all protocol- required assessments as described in 
Section  7.  
6 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
As of the implementation of Protocol Amendment 2, it is no longer required to document procedures and medications used during the study in the eCRF (see Section 10.5). 
6.1 Supportive Care  
During the study, support ive care (eg , anti- emetics; analgesics for pain control) may be used 
at the investigator’s discretion and in accordance with institutional procedures.  
Erythropoietin, darbepoetin alfa, and/or hematopoietic colony- stimulating factors for 
treatment of cytopenias should be administered per standard of care and according to institutional guidelines. Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be in accordance with institutional guidelines. 
6.2 Anticancer or Experimental Therapy  
No other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including chemotherapy, radiation, antibody or other immunotherapy, gene therapy, vaccine therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, or other experimental drugs) of any kind will be permitted while the patient is participating in the study, with the exception of palliative radiotherapy and hormonal treatment, such as GnRH therapy. Prior treatment with such excluded anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171294] > [ADDRESS_200698] dose of study drug or as specified in the treatment arm- specific 
inclusion/ex clusion criteria (Section 4.2 and Section 4.3, respectively ). 
Any botanical preparations (eg, herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) intended to treat the disease under study or provide supportive care are prohibited (except those prescribed as supportive care by a health care professional as per  Section  6.1). 
6.3 Radiotherapy  
Palliative radiotherapy on lesions not considered target lesions for tumor evaluation is  
permitted during the study. Treatment with study drug should be held prior to initiation of radiation therapy and until the patient has recovered from any radiation related toxicity. 
6.4 CYP450 Isoenzyme  Inhibitors, Inducers, and Substrate s 
At the steady state following treatment with 600  mg rucaparib BID, rucaparib is a moderate 
inhibitor of CYP1A2, and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. R efer to  the 
[Rucaparib (CO-338)]   Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-[ADDRESS_200699] of enzalutamide on rucaparib PK, no other strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers are allowed.  
In addition, the  following rules should be followed in specific study arms: 
• Arm A : Enzalutamide is a substrate of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Concomitant strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inducers are prohibited. Enzalutamide is a strong 
CYP3A4 inducer, and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Concomitant use 
with drugs that are sensitive substrates of  CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 should be 
avoided. 
• Arm B: C oncomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers and sensitive CYP2D6 substrates are 
prohibited. 
 
Refer to Appendix 3 for examples of sensitive CYP substrates and refer to Appendix 4 for 
examples of CYP inhibitors and inducers. 
6.5 Anticoagulants 
Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and enzalutamide is a moderate CYP2C9 inducer . 
Caution should be exercised particularly in A rm A, for patients receiving rucaparib or 
enzalutamide with  concomitant warfarin (Coumadin). Patients taking warfarin should have 
international normalized ratio (INR) monitored regularly per standard clinical practice.  
Direct oral antic oagulants (eg, api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], rivaroxaban, and dabigatran) have elimination 
mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and/or P-gp. As enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer in vivo, and enzalutamide and N -desmethyl enzalutamide are P -gp inhibitors in vitro, concomitant 
administration with enzalutamide may result in altered exposure s of these ant icoagulants . If 
such anticoagulants have to be used, monitor INR regularly per standard clinical practice.  
6.6 Imaging Restrictions and Precautions  
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibility to determine, based on patient attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast regimen for each patient. Oral and/or intravenous (IV) contrast should be used whenever possible and appropriate , and rectal contrast should only be considered in patients 
with peritoneal disease. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks should be considered in this assessment. Patients with renal insufficiency should be assessed as to whether or not they should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. Specific to magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ), patients with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated 
GFR <  30 mL/min) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast 
should not be given to this patient population. In addition, patients should not get  MRI if they 
have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc.

6.7 Other Concomitant Medications  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171295]’s well -being may be given at the discretion of 
the investigator and should be documented on the eCRF (see Section 10.5 ). Other 
concomitant medications, except for analgesics, chronic treatments for concomitant medical conditions, or agents required for life-threatening medical problems, should be avoided. Herbal and complementary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171296], but any taken by [CONTACT_171353] (see Section 10.5).  
Rucaparib marginally increased digoxin AUC by 20%. Caution should be exercised for 
patients receiving rucaparib and requiring concomitant medication with digoxin. Patients taking digoxin should have their digoxin levels monitored after starting rucaparib and then regularly per standard clinical practice.  
In vitro, rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE-1 and MATE-2- K, a moderate inhibitor of 
OCT1, and a weak inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of these transporters could de crease 
renal elimination an d liver uptake of metformin, caution is advised when metformin is 
co-administered with rucaparib.  
Abiraterone is a weak CYP2C8 inhibitor in vivo. In vitro, abiraterone and its metabolites 
inhibit organic anion t ransporter (OAT) OATP1B1. Use caution if sensitive CY P2C8 
substrate drugs or OATP1B1 substrate drugs need to be used concomitantly with study drugs. 
Refer to the rucaparib IB  and to the enza lutamide or abiraterone prescribing information  for 
additional information.

 PK samples will be collected according to Table  7-2. 
In Arm A, patients will receive treatment of rucaparib  for 1 week  (Run-In Day s 1-7), 
followed by [CONTACT_171355] 28 -day cycles. Plasma PK samples 
will be collected prior to the morning doses in on Run-In Days 6 and 7 during the run-in 
period, and on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle s 1 and 2, and on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 4, 6 and 8. 
The morning dose should be approximately 24 hours after the previous morning doses of 
enzalutamide and rucaparib, and approximately 12 hours before the previous evening dose of rucaparib. If the start of the next treatment cycle is delayed, the PK sample should still be collected during this visit instead of on Day 1 of the delayed start of the next treatment cycle.  
Concentrations of enzalutamide, its metabolite N-desmethyl enzalutamide, rucaparib, and its metabolite M324 will be determined using validated assays. 
In Arm B, patients will receive treatment of  rucaparib  for 1 week  (Run-In Day s 1-7), 
followed by [CONTACT_171356] 28- day cycles. Plasma PK samples 
will be collected prior to the morning doses on Run -In Days 6 and 7 during the run-in period, 
on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1, as well as on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. The 
morning dose should be approximately 24 hours after the previous morning doses of abiraterone  acetate and rucaparib, and approximately 12 hours before the previous evening 
dose of rucaparib. If the start of the next treatment cycle is delayed, the PK sample should still be collected during this visit instead of on Day 1 of the delayed start of the next treatment cycle.  Concentrations of abiraterone , rucaparib  and its metabolite M324 will be

 [IP_ADDRESS] Blood Sample for  Plasma  ctDNA  Analyses  
Blood samples for plasma ctDNA analyses will be collected during screening, before dosing 
with rucaparib on the first run -in day, and on Day 1 of Cycle 2  during combination treatment. 
These samples will be used for genomic profiling to assess alteration s in genes that may be 
associated with response and resistance to rucaparib in combination with AR-directed  
therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Sample for Pharmacogenomics Analys es 
Blood samples for pharmacogenomics analyses will be collected at Study Day 1 of the run-in 
period from all patients. If the pharmacogenomics sample is missed, it may be collected during a later cycle (ie, Cycle 2 or later). Genomic DNA will be extracted from the cellular portion of these blood samples analyzed to determine whether the BRCA1/2  mutation or 
other HRR gene mutation is germline or somatic prior to final data analysis.  Additionally, 
polymorphisms of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion ( ADME )-related genes 
relevant to the DDI analysis may be explored per sponsor’s request .  
Because the germline analysis will be done near the end of the study, there are no plans to share these results with the investigator. However, if an actionable mutation, as defined by [CONTACT_171357] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/acmg/), is revealed that was not detected in tumor or plasma, these incidental finding may be made available to the investigator provided the results are generated from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA)- certified  laboratory.

 of pre-existing conditions, including the disease under study, that do not represent a clinically 
significant  exacerbation or worsening are not considered AEs.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to monitor all AEs that occur during the study. AEs 
should be elicited by [CONTACT_99020] a non-leading question (eg, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”). The existence of an AE may be concluded from a spontaneous report of the patient; from the physical examination; or from special tests such as the ECG, laboratory assessments, or other study- specifi ed procedure (source of AE). Symptoms reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_171358] (and hence documented on the AE eCRF , instead of the physical examination eCRF [see Section 10.5 ], which is reserved

(eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) ; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171299] 24  hours duration (eg, patient presents to the emergency room,  
but is not admitted to a ward);  
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication unless  associated with an SAE. 
However, the event should still be captured as a nonserious AE on the appropriate eCRF page (see Sectio n 10.5 ). The accompanying SAE should be reported and overdose should 
be described in the report; 
• Events of progression of the patient’s underlying cancer as well as events clearly related to progression of the patient’s cancer (signs and symptoms of progression) should not be reported as a n AE  or SAE; or 
• Events that meet the SAE criteria (as outlined in Section  8.2) and occur after informed 
consent but before the first dose of study drug, which are considered unrelated to protocol-mandated screening procedures.

An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as 
an AE only if any one of the following criteria is met:  
• an action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality  
• intervention for management  of the abnormality is required  
• at the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be deemed clinically significant.

partner of a study patient during study participation or within [ADDRESS_200719] be reported to the sponsor using the Pregnancy Report Form within the same timelines as an SAE.  
All pregnanc ies will  be followed through to outcome. Once the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known, the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form is to be completed and reported to the sponsor. 
AEs, SAEs, or AESIs that occur during pregnancy will be assessed and processed according to the AE or SAE/AESI processes using the appropriate AE or SAE/AESI forms.  
8.[ADDRESS_200720]  
Events that occur after signing of informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, unless due to a protocol-mandated procedure, are to be recorded on the Medical History eCRF  (see Section 10.5 ); however, during this time if the event is serious and related to a 
protocol-mandated proce dure it is to be reported as an SAE . As of the implementation of

8.7.1 Onset Date of Adverse Events  
The onset date is the date that the event or the signs/symptoms attributed  to the event started.  
8.7.2 Resolution Date of Adverse Events  
The resolution date is the date that the event or the signs/symptoms attributed to the event 
resolved or resolved with sequelae or it is the date when the patient has reached a new baseline if the event is not expected to resolve.  
8.7.3 I ntensity of Adverse Events  
The severity of each AE  will be graded using the NCI CTCAE, v5 grading scale
.39 
“Severity ” is not the same as “s erious ”. 
For AEs  not covered by [CONTACT_4652], the severity will be characterized as mild, moderate, 
severe, life- threate ning, or fatal  according to the following definitions:  
• Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities , 
• Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and may interfere with daily activities , 
• Severe events interrupt the patient’s usual daily activities and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) may be required, 
• Life-threatening events require urgent intervention to prevent death, or  
• Fatal events are those events that lead to the patient’s d eath.  
 
8.7.4 Causal Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the cause of the AE  considering all relevant 
factors such as, but not limited to , the underlying study indication, co- existing disease, 
concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE , temporal relationship to th e 
study medication, and dechallenge or rechallenge with the study drug ( Table  8-1).

9 STATISTICAL METHODS  
General Considerations 
Quantitative variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages for appropriate 
categorizations and may also be summarized using descriptive statistics. For variables summarized with descriptive statis tics, th e following will be presented: N, mean, standard 
deviation (StD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be presented using frequencies and percentages.  
All data will be used to their maximum possible extent but without any imput ations for 
missing data. Unless otherwise specified, baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first day of study drug administration .  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS
® System, v 9.3 or higher. Further 
details around the statistical analys es planned in this study will be outlined in the s tatistical 
analysis plan (SAP). Changes to or deviations from the SAP will be described in the clinical study report (CSR).  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The total enrollment planned is up to 60 evaluable patients  (30 in Arm A and 30 in Arm B) . 
The overall sample size in the PK assessment  phase of each arm depends on the occurrence 
of safety findings, specifically  DLTs, observed at the different dose regimens. It is 
anticipated that a minimum of 6 and maximum of 18 patients will be enrolled,  unless 
additional patients are required to be enrolled , due to some patients not being evaluable for 
DLT  assessment .  
The Dose Expansion phase of each arm  will enroll up to 12 additional patients to evaluate the 
optimal dose combination for each treatment arm.  
[Rucaparib (CO-338)]   Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: CO -338-107 Amendment 2  19 January 2022 
 
Confidential  Page 79 of 106 
 A total of 18 patients  at the recommended combination dose in each treatment arm  is 
anticipated to provide adequate PK information (in addition to safety and tolerability) for 
each combination. Assuming an intra-subject PK variability of 40%, N = 18 patients  would 
be sufficient for the point estimate of the geometric ratio of trough concentration 
(ie, concentration before the next dose is administered [ Ctrough]) of rucaparib with and without 
co-administration of one of the combination drugs to fall within 80% and 125% of the true 
value with 90% confidence. Fewer patients may be enrolled if the PK variability is less than anticipated.  
If a patient drops off the study or becomes unevaluable for sa fety (DLTs) , an additional 
patient may be enrolled. 
9.2 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are defined for the study: 
• Dose -limiting toxicity ( DLT)-evaluable Population  – For Arm A, the DLT -evaluable 
population will consist of all patients who  completed at least 70% of the scheduled doses 
of both rucaparib and enzalutamide  and completed Cycle s [ADDRESS_200732] 80% of the scheduled doses of  both 
rucaparib and enzalutamide and completed Cycle 1 of treatment, or who experienced a 
DLT in Cycle 1. 
• Safety Population  – The safety population will consist of all patients who received at 
least 1 dose of  any study drug.  
• Efficacy Population  – The efficacy population will consist of all patients evaluable for 
response by [CONTACT_143900]/ PCWG3 criteria  (ie, PSA response) and could be subdivided into 
the RECIST -evaluable population and the PSA-evaluable population. 
• Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  Population – The PK population will consist of all patients who 
received at least [ADDRESS_200733] 1 measurable concentration .  
 
9.3 Patient Disposition  
Patient disposition will be summarized using frequency counts and the corresponding percentages. The number of patients in each analysis population, number of patients discontinued, and the primary reason for discontinuation will be summarized. 
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
All demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the safety population.  
In addition to basic demographic characteristics, the following baseline variables will be summarized with frequency tabulations:  
• Time since diagnosis of primary tumor (months): 0  to 12, > 12  to 24, > 24;

 • The following characteristics of a deleterious mutation in BRCA1/2  or other HRR gene 
will also be summarized for patients with these mutations:  
- Status (germline or somatic) of mutation in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_200734] overall response of complete response ( CR) or partial response ( PR) per m RECIST  v1.[ADDRESS_200735] 4 weeks after initial response.  
ORR (confirmed CR+PR) will be summarized with frequencies and percentages, Similar summaries of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, stable disease (SD), or progressive disease ( PD) will be pr esented . All summaries of response rates will be 
accompanied by 95% CIs. 
PSA response per PCWG3 criteria is a confirmed PSA response (≥  50% decrease from 
baseline) as reflected local laboratory measurements. PSA response rate will be summarized 
along with a 95% CI . 
9.6 Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be summarized for the Safety Population.  
Safety endpoints are incidence of AEs, clinical laboratory abnormalities, and dose modifications.  
AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, ECG results, ECOG PS, body weight, and concomitant medications/ procedures will be tabulated and summarized.  
9.6.1 Extent of Exposure 
Duration of exposure will be summarized descriptively and categorically. The number and percentage of patients with dose reductions and dose interr uptions will be provided.  
9.6.2 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system. The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI  CTCAE  v5.0. TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset date ranging from on or after 
the date of first dose of study drug until [ADDRESS_200736] dose of study drug.  
The number and percentage of patients who experienced TEAEs for each System Organ 
Class ( SOC) and P referred T erm (PT) will be presented. Multiple instances of the TEAE in

The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_8792] (rucaparib  and/or 
enzalutamide/abiraterone) according to the following categories: “treatment -related,” o r “not 
treatment- related”. If a patient experiences multiple occurrences of the same AE with 
different relationship categories for the study drug, the patient will be counted once, as a 
relationship category of treatment related.  
If a patient experiences multiple occurrences of the same AE with different toxicity grades, 
the patient will be counted once for the maximum (most severe) toxicity grade. AEs with a missing toxicity grade will be presented in the summary table with a toxicity grade of “Missing.” For each toxicity grade, the number and percentage of patients with at least 1 TEAE of the given grade will be summarized.  
9.6.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory evaluations include the continuous variables for hematology and chemistry. The laboratory values will generally be presented in International System of Units (SI). The treatment period will be defined as the time from the first dose of rucaparib to [ADDRESS_200738] value during the treatment period.  
Supporting laboratory data including normal ranges and abnormal laboratory flags will be 
provided using by-patient listings. Separate listings will be produced for clinically significant

 The investigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure of 
confidential patient information to any unauthorized party or into the public domain. The investigator will notify Clovis Oncology ([EMAIL_3414]) within [ADDRESS_200747] research organization ( CRO ) or contract monitor will 
contact [CONTACT_171366] (unless the sponsor or the CRO has worked wit h the center recently  in the same or comparable 
indication, the site location and facilities have not changed significantly, and the potential investigator/site are in good standing with respect to previous regulatory compliance , in 
which case this initial visit maybe waived) and a t appropriate intervals during the study until 
after the last patient is completed .  
In accordance with ICH GCP and local regulations, the clinical monitor will periodically review, via direct access, eCRFs, study documents, and medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for patients enrolled in this study. Monitors will not share patient identifiers with the sponsor. Additionally, the clinical monitor will review and assess research facilities and clinical laboratory fac ilities associated with the study. Clinical monitoring will be scheduled 
to occur at mutually convenient times until completion of the study. If these requirements are in conflict with local regulatory restrictions or institutional requirements, the invest igator 
must inform the sponsor of these restrictions before initiation of the study.  
Where applicable, if the sponsor or their representatives are not able to come to the study center, patient study data may be reviewed by [CONTACT_171367], in conformity with the applicable institutional guidance and local regulations. The site staff may place relevant medical records, with personal identifiers removed, into a secure computer system for the sponsor or their representative to view, allow them to view these reco rds during a video 
conference, and/or provide them direct access to patients’ electronic medical records. This 
review would occur in a manner that protects the confidentiality of study patient data. Whether a patient’s medical records are reviewed at the study center or remotely, their identity and medical records will be kept secure during this process. Remote review of patient study data should not be carried out if adequate data protection, including data security and protection of personal data even if pseudonymized, is not ensured. Further details will be provided in the study training materials and/or the clinical monitoring plan.  
The investigator must ensure provision of sufficient time, reasonable space, and adequate 
qualified personnel for the monitoring visits. The purpose of these visits is to allow the 
clinical monitor an opportunity to  verify adherence to the study protocol and  assess the 
completeness, consistency, and accuracy of data entered on the eCRFs and other documents ; 
however, the invest igator retains ultimate responsibility for the quality and integrity of data 
generated by [CONTACT_779]. The clinical monitor will confirm all aspects of the study that are essential for human patient protection and safety as well as those related to the validi ty and 
reliability of study data.

 The i nvestigato r will make all source data (ie , the various study records, the eCRFs, 
laboratory test reports, other patient records, drug accountability forms, and other pertinent 
data) available for the monitor and allow  access to them throughout the entire study period. 
Monitoring is done by [CONTACT_171368]’ relevant source data that are maintained in 
site records w ith the information entered on the eCRF (ie, source data verification). It is the 
monitor’s respon sibility to verify the adherence to the study protocol and the completeness, 
consistency, and accuracy of the data recorded on the eCRFs; however, the investigator retains ultimate responsibility for the quality and integrity of data generated by [CONTACT_779] .  
By [CONTACT_115519], the investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of the monitoring visits are resolved. Contact [CONTACT_171369]. Representatives 
from the sponsor may also contact [CONTACT_171370]. 
10.5 Case Report Forms and Study Data  
Upon approval of Protocol Amendment 2, collection of data i n eCRFs is no longer 
required as the study database  will be locked .  
The data will be collected using an electronic data capture (EDC) system by [CONTACT_171371]. Sites will receive training on the EDC system. All users will be supplied with unique login credentials.  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the site under the supervision 
of the investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accu racy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  All source documents  will be completed in a 
neat, legible manner, according to the principles of at tributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original or certified copy, accurate, and plus (+) complete, c onsistent, enduring, and a vailable 
(ALCOA+),  to ensure a ccurate interpretation of data. Data recorded in the eCRF should be 
consistent with the data recorded on the source documents.  
Prior to study start, the investigator will prepare a list s howing the signature [CONTACT_171384] . This “study site personnel and 
delegation list” must be kept current throughout the study. Clinical data  (including AEs , concomitant medications, and e xpected adverse reactions data) 
and clinical laboratory data will be entered into  a [ADDRESS_200748] results  are to  be documented and input in to applicable  eCRFs.

All questions or comments related to  EDC should be directed to the assigned monitor. 
Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  
10.6 Study Termination and Site Closure  
The sponsor, the investigator /institution, or IRB/IEC  reserve the right to terminate the study 
at any tim e. Should this be necessary, the sponsor and investigator will arrange 
discontinuation procedures. In terminating the study, the sponsor and the investigator will 
assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ interests.  
The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for medical or 
administrative reasons. When feasible, a 30 -day written notification will be given. 
The entire study will be stopped if: 
• The protocol- specified treatment is considered too toxi c to continue the study;  
• Evidence has emerged that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_171301](s), makes the continuation of the study unnecessary or unethical; 
• The stated objectives of the study are achieved; or  
• The sponsor discontinues the development of the study treatment. 
 
If the study is terminated prematurely the sponsor will promptly inform the  
investigators/institutions, and the regulatory authority(ies) of the termination or suspension 
and the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. The investigators will promptly inform their IRB/IEC, providing the reason(s) for the termination or suspension by [CONTACT_171372]/institution, as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s).   
10.[ADDRESS_200749] udy Protocol  
Protocol modifications (ie, amendments ) must be made only with the prior approval of the 
sponsor. Agreement from the investigator must be obtained for all protocol modifications  and 
changes to the  informed consent document. The IRB/ IEC must be informed of all 
amendments and give approval prior to their implementation. The sponsor will submit any 
study protocol amendments to the concerned regulatory authorities for approval and keep the investigator(s) updated as detailed in the ICH GCP guidelin es. Protocol deviations are 
described in Section  10.9.1. 
10.8 Retention of Study Documents  
The study site will maintain a study file, which should contain all documents defined in the ICH E6(R2) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. The investigator should have control of all essential documents generated by [CONTACT_779]. Source documents must be maintained, ALCOA + 
documentation practice used. Any changes to source data should be traceable, should not

 obscure the original entry, and should be explained if necessary  (via an audit trail). The 
investigator must implement procedures to ensure the integrity  of any data generated.  
The sponsor and investigator will maintain a record of the location(s) of their respective 
essential documents including source documents. The storage systems used during the study and for archiving (irrespective of media used) must provide for documentation identification, version, h istory, search, and retrieval. The investigator agrees to keep records and those 
documents that include (but are not limited to) the identification of all participating patients, medical records, study- specific source documents, source worksheets, all orig inal signed and 
dated ICF s, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], query responses, and detailed records of drug disposition to 
enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities and the sponsor or its designees.  
The investigator shall retain records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of the study for a period of 25 years after study completion; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until at least [ADDRESS_200750] be notified in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location. The sponsor will inform the investigator, in  
writing, when the study- related records are no longer needed.  
All clinical study information should be recorded, handled, and stored in a way that allows accurate reporting, interpretation, and verification, irrespective of the media used.  
Patients’ medical records and other original data will be archived in accorda nce with the 
archiving regulations or facilities of the investigational site; but at a minimum, for the period defined by [CONTACT_1214]. 
10.[ADDRESS_200751] be 
documented in the source documents and reported to the sponsor.  
10.9.2 Study Site Training and Ongoing Monitoring

 aspects of this study. This may include, but is not limited to, on -site training, Investigator 
Meeting(s), and/  or tele/ videoconferencing. Training may be ongoing as refresher, to address 
specific items, or to introduce changes in the study. When site staff join after study training 
has been conducted, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the new staff member is 
trained.  
10.9.[ADDRESS_200752] Access to Source Data/Documents for Audits and Inspections  
Each  investigator site is to maintain a record of locations of essential documents and study 
source documents. Members of the sponsor’s GCP Quality Assurance Department or 
designees may conduct an audit of a clinical site at any time during or after completion  of the 
study. The investigator will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Inspections and audits are typi[INVESTIGATOR_171302] , and data are generated, 
documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, written SOPs and applicable laws, rules, and regulations. 
Representatives of the FDA,  European Medicines Agency, or other regulatory agencies, as 
well as IRB representatives may also conduct an inspection of the study. If informed of such 
an inspection, the investigator should notify the sponsor immediately. The i nvestigator will 
ensure that the auditors or inspectors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, 
and laboratory, and that all data (including original source documentation) and all study files are available, if requested.

A short summary is given below. 
Measurable Disease:  
Tumor lesions: measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter [LD]  to be recorded) with the following: 
• A minimum size of [ADDRESS_200760] scan (CT  scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) 
• A minimum size of 10  mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded  as nonmeasurable ) 
• A minimum size of [ADDRESS_200761] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥  [ADDRESS_200762]  scan (CT  scan slice thickness 
recommended to be not greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
Nonmeasurable Disease:  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions ( LD < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥  10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly nonmeasurable lesions, are 
considered nonmeasurable disease. Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin and lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415].  
Bone Lesions For th e purposes of this study, bone metastatic lesions should be recorded at baseline and 
followed during treatment using PCWG3 criteria. Bone lesions should not be recorded as 
target or nontarget lesions according to mRECIST  criteria.

 Lesions with Prior Local  Treatment  
Tumor lesions situated in a previous irradiated area or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. 
Target Lesions All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ (per PCWG3) , representative 
of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at 
baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the LD ) and 
their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the LD for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218] .  
Nontarget Lesions  
RECIST  Version  1.[ADDRESS_200763] should be perf ormed 
using a ≤  [ADDRESS_200764] 
performed as part of a positron emission tomography ( PET) /CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET/CT can 
be used for RECIST measurements.  
Lesions on chest X- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.   
Ultrasound, endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be use d to measure tumor lesions.  
Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (eg, after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant 
lesions.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_30574] a  treatment.

 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to <  [ADDRESS_200765] a 30% decrease in the sum of  the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD. 
Stable Disease Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.
 
Progressive Disease  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm. The 
appearance of one or more new extra-skeletal lesions is also considered 
progression.  For bone lesions, refer to PCWG3 criteria for determining 
progressive disease.
 
 
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions  
Complete Response  Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level.  
Stable Disease/Incomplete Response  Persistence of 1  or more nontarget lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease  Appearance of 1  or more new extra-skeletal lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing nontarget lesions.  For bone lesions, refer to PCWG3 
criteria for determining progressive disease.  
If tumor markers are initially above the institutional ULN, they must normalize for a patient 
to be considered a complete responder.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Any Yes PD 
a ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non- target disease since SD is increasingly used 
as endpoint for assessment of efﬁcacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be 
measured is not advised.  
Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
symptomatic deterioration. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatment. 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to  distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated (fine -needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/biopsy) prior to confirming the complete 
response status.

Duration of Response  
Duration of Overall Response 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for 
CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started), including progression in bone per PCWG3 criteria. 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progress ion are met, 
taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
PCWG3 Criteria for Assessment of Bone Disease  
PCWG3 criteria will be used to document evidence of disease progression in bone lesions as 
described by [CONTACT_171376], e t al. [ADDRESS_200768]. A quantitative measure of disease burden, such as lesion number, the bone scan index, or lesion area,  is also suggested, recognizing that 
these measures require further analytical and prospective clinical validation. Changes in lesions considered metastatic on  bone scintigraphy should be followed and assessed serially 
using a bone scan assessment form. Areas/lesions on bone scintigraphy that are suggestive can be assessed further with CT or MRI and followed separately, but such supplemental imaging should not be used to establish indicator lesions for the purposes of a study. 
Different modalities for imaging bone metastases c an provide different information for the 
same patient. However, because of the lack of standards for reporting disease presence or 
changes after treatment, PET imaging with sodium fluoride, fluorodeoxyglucose, choline, or 
prostate -specific membrane antigen , bone marrow MRI (body MRI), and other modalities 
that are in use to image bone, should be approached as new biomarkers subject to independent validation. 
Criteria for progression in bone at study entry  
• Two new lesions observed on 99mTc- methylene diphosphonate radionuclide bone 
scintigraphy

 • Confirm ambiguous results by [CONTACT_15210] (eg, CT or MRI) however only 
positivity on the bone scan defines metastatic disease to bone  
 
Documentation of baseline bone disease 
• Presence or absence of metastasis recorded first  
• A quantitative measure of disease burden, such as lesional number,  the bone scan index, 
or lesion  area, is required  
• Changes in lesions considered metastatic on bone scintigraphy should be followed and 
assessed serially using a bone scan assessment form. Areas/lesions on bone scintigraphy that are suggestive can be assessed further with CT or MRI and followed separately,  but 
such supplemental imaging should not be used to establish indicator lesions for the purposes of a trial 
 
Following for bone progression during the study 
• Exclude pseudoprogression in the absence of symptoms or other signs of progression 
• At least two ne w lesions on first post- treatment scan, with at least two additional lesions 
on the next scan (2 + 2 rule)  
• If at least two additional new lesions are seen on the next (confirmatory) scan, the date of 
progression is the date of the first post- treatment scan , when the first two new lesions 
were documented  
• For scans after the first post -treatment scan, at least two new lesions relative to the first 
post- treatment scan confirmed on a subsequent scan  
• Date of progression is the date of the scan that first documents the second lesion  
• Changes in intensity of uptake alone do not constitute either progression or regression

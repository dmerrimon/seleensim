 [7] 1 BACKGROUND/RATIONALE  
1.A Non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  
The non- Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) are a diverse group of lymphoid neoplasms that collectively rank 
fifth in cancer incidence and mortality in the United  States.[1, 2]  The incidence and prevalence of NHL 
has risen 150% over the past few decades.[3, 4]  The incidence of NHL increases with age and males are 
affected about 1.5 times more often than females.  
The majority of n on-Hodgkin’s lymphomas is  of B-cell origin and can be categorized according to the 
International Working Formulation (IWF) or the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) 
classification.[5-7]  The use of the WHO modified REAL classificati on of non- Hodgkin’s lymphomas is 
strongly encouraged .  The estimated median survival time for patients with follicular lymphoma is 7 -10 
years from initial diagnosis. [8 –13] 
Transformation of low-grade NHL to a more aggressive subtype has been reported to occur in about 25% - 60% of patients over time.
[9, 10, 14,15]  Patients with low -grade NHL usually present with advanced 
disseminated disease.[11, 12, 16,17]  Chemotherapy treatment with or without radiotherapy can lead to 
remissions; however, virtually all treated patients repeatedly relapse[18] with shorter remissions following 
each subsequent course of chemotherapy.[9-13, 19]   Although there have been several additions to the 
oncologist ’s chemotherapy repertoire, no chemotherapeutic regimen has been shown to be superior to 
another in prolonging survival in follicular NHL, [14, 20 -22] and there has been little to no change in 
survival in the past 30 years.  
 Thus, follicular non- Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) pose a particularly difficult dilemma for clinicians 
and new treatment strategies are needed.  
 
 1.B Overview of Chemotherapy for Follicular Lymphoma     
 With the exception of a small fraction of patients (10% - 15%) with t ruly localized disease, as noted 
above most patients with indolent lymphoma do not achieve long -term remissions. [23,24]   Because 
conventional chemotherapy regimens have not been shown to improve survival in this disease compared 
with a policy of expectan t therapy, [23]   many asymptomatic patients are followed with “watchful 
waiting.”   Symptomatic patients are commonly treated with oral alkylating agents (e.g., chlorambucil), or with an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide) in combination with a vinca alkaloid and corticosteroids (CVP), but studies have not demonstrated a survival advantage for patients treated with these regimens.   
  Because of the curative potential of anthracycline- based regimens (e.g., CHOP) for aggressive NHL, 
CHOP has been tested ext ensively by [CONTACT_60857] (SWOG) in patients with indolent 
lymphomas. 
[25-28] Four hundred fifteen patients with low -grade malignant lymphomas were treated with 
CHOP (with or without BCG and/or levamisole) between 1972 and 1983 on SWOG-7204, SWOG-7426, and SWOG -7713.  Approximately 90% of these patients achieved objective responses, including 61% -
78% with complete remissions. 
[25-27] With a median follow -up of 12.8 years, the median survival was 
6.9 years.  [28] Toxicities included myelosuppression, nausea, paresthesias, infection, and cardiomyopathy 
(<5%).  Unfortunately, these studies failed to demonstrate a plateau on the survival curves of patients treated with CHOP, indicating that by [CONTACT_100272], in contrast to its efficacy for diffuse large cell lymphomas.
[28]  Whether cures with CHOP are possible for 
patients with follicular lymphomas remains controversial, with conflicting studies from several institutions.
[29-32]  Nevertheless, all investigators agree on the necessity of developi[INVESTIGATOR_100228].    
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [8]  Newer chemotherapy agents (fludarabine, 2 -chlorodeoxyadenosine) have shown considerable activity in 
patients with relapsed low -grade lymphomas; however, no study has demonstrated that these drugs are 
curative in indolent lymphomas or that survival is prolonged by [CONTACT_100273].  SWOG -9501 investigated the 
combination of fludarabine plus mitoxantrone in patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphomas.  
This regimen was well tolerated and produced a high response rate, but the survival curves do not appear superior to those obtained with other regimens, including CHOP. 
[33]  Other chemotherapy regimens 
which have been found to be effective for relapsed indolent lymphoma include ESHAP, [34, 35] which has 
published response rates ranging from 36% to as high as 82%.  
 High -dose chemoradiotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is 
commonly employed for treatment of patients with relapsed lymphomas of all types.  Preliminary data from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute suggest the disease- free survival after transplantation for follicular 
lymphomas relates to the quality of initial morphological remission obtained and the ability to decrease the number of cells bearing clonal rearrangements of the bcl -2-oncogene (which is present in 80% of 
newly diagnosed follicular lymphomas).
[36]  However, the curability of indolent lymphomas with stem 
cell transplantation and the advisability of performing this procedure are controversial.   
 
1.C Monoclonal Antibody Therapy of B- Cell Non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  
Attempts to treat B -cell malignancies with immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies reactive against 
B-cell antigens, began over a decade ago.[37-41]  In early studies using murine monoclonal antibodies, 
responses were limited by [CONTACT_100274] -mouse antibody (HAMA), by [CONTACT_100275] r killing, and by 
[CONTACT_100276]- regulation of the target antigen.[42]  Efficacy could also be limited by [CONTACT_100277].  
Recent approaches that have been taken to improve the clinical outcome of immunotherapy include: 
• use of chimeric, humanized, or PRIMATIZED® antibodies to reduce antibody immunogenicity 
(HAMA);  
• choice of target antigen that does not modulate, internalize, and/or shed from the cell surface; 
• use of new high-yield manufacturing procedures allowing higher dosing levels; 
• use of radioimmunoconjugates and other immunotoxins. 
 
 1.C.1 Rituximab 
Rituximab (Rituxan, MabThera) is a chimeric IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody, with mouse 
variable and human constant regions.  It specifically recognizes the CD20 antigen expressed on norma l 
B cells and most malignant B -cell lymphomas.[43] The CD20 antigen is a suitable target for treatment of 
B-cell lymphomas because it does not circulate in the plasma as free protein that could block targeting of 
an antibody to lymphomas,[44] does not internalize upon anti -CD20 antibody binding, and does not shed 
from the cell surface after antibody binding.[45] 
In vitro  studies have demonstrated that rituximab binds human complement and lyses lymphoid B -cell 
lines through CDC (complement dependent cytotoxicity) and antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity.  
Rituximab has also been shown to have antiproliferative effects in tritiated thymidine incorporation 
assays and to directly induce apoptosis, while othe r anti -CD19 and CD20 antibodies do not.[46] 
Rituximab (Rituxan) is licensed in the [LOCATION_002] as therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory 
low-grade or follicular, CD20 positive, B -cell non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) (See the appr opriate 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [9] Appendix for the Package Insert); in Europe, rituximab (MabThera) is licensed as therapy for patients 
with stage III -IV follicular lymphoma who are chemo resistant  or are in their second or subsequent 
relapse after chemotherapy.  In an open -label,  single arm, multi- center pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], 166 patients with 
relapsed disease received four weekly infusions of 375 mg/m2 rituximab.[47]  Ninety -one percent of 
patients (151 of 166) were evaluable for efficacy and an overall response rate of  50% with 6% CR and 
44% PR was achieved.  Median time to progression for responders was 13.2 months.[48, 49]  Other studies 
have demonstrated the activity of rituximab in patients with both treated and untreated lymphomas. [50, 
51]  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_100229], 40% -50% of patients with indolent 
lymphomas and 60% -70% of patients with aggressive lymphomas fail to respond to single -agent 
rituximab, only 5% -10% of patients attain complete remissions, and the median duration is only 
approximately [ADDRESS_110376] begun exploring methods of enhancing 
the potency of antibodies, including combining them with chemotherapy and conjugating them to toxins or radionucleotides.   
Czuczman conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_100230] (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, prednisone) with rituximab to 40 patients with indolent lymphoma.  Objective remissions were observed in 38 patients (95%), including 22 CRs (55%), with a median time -to-treatment failure of 
more than 29 months.
[52]  In SWOG 9800, 85 evaluable patients with previously untreated advanced 
stage indolent lymphoma who were treated with 6 cycles of CHOP followed by [CONTACT_100278] 
[53]  to have an overall response rate of 72% with 54% complete 
remissions and a 2- year progression -free survival rate of 74%.  CHOP plus rituximab is currently being 
further evaluated in previously untreated advanced indolent lymphoma in SWOG 0016, a randomized phase III trial (SWOG 0016) comparing CHOP plus rituximab with CHOP plus Iodine -131 
Tositumomab (Bexxar). 
 
1.D   Radioimmunotherapy of Lymphoma 
Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies are efficacious in treating NHL for the following reasons: 
lymphocytes and lymphoma cells are inherently sensitive to radiotherapy[54]; the local emission of 
ionizing radiation by [CONTACT_100279]; and penetrating radiat ion may obviate the problem of limited access in 
bulky or poorly vascularized tumors. 
Early investigations of therapeutic radiolabeled antibodies for B -cell lymphoma were performed with 
iodinated antibodies.
[55-60]  (Detailed below in Sect ion 1.D.1)  However, the development and 
improvement of methods for attaching metal chelating groups to proteins have made it possible to study 
other potentially useful radioisotopes such as 90Yttrium (90Y). (Detailed below in Section 1.D.2.)  
90Yttrium ha s several advantages over 131I and for these reasons, has been selected for this study.  
As a pure, high- energy, beta- emitting isotope, 90Y can deliver more energy to the tumor (2.3 MeV versus 
0.6 MeV of beta energy for 131I) and the longer pathlength (χ90 = 5 mm versus 1 mm for 131I)[61] may 
allow tumor cells in the vicinity of the antibody -bound cell to be killed without direct binding of the 
antibody.[62]  These characteristics may be especially advantageous in the treat ment of poorly 
vascularized tumors.  The shorter half -life of 90Y (2.7 days versus 8 days for 131I) approximates the 
biological half -life of the radiolabeled antibody, which may minimize toxicity to nontarget organs.  
Because 131I emits penetrating gamma r ays (0.35 MeV), patients receive an increased whole body dose.  
In addition, patients require the following: 1) shielding to protect hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717], 2) restrictions in travel, 
activities, the use of bedroom and bathroom facilities to limit exposure to family and the public, and 3) possible hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Furthermore, dehalogenation of 
131I leads to accumulation of free iodine in the 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [10] thyroid, posing the risk of hypothyroidism; this risk is present in patients treated with prophylactic 
potassium iodide as well.  The isotope, 90Y, is a pure beta emitter and can therefore be given on an 
outpatient basis without patient restrictions.  
While the beta emitter, 90Y, provides therapeutic advantages, it cannot be used for imaging.  The gamma 
emitter, 111In, has been successfully used as an imaging agent prior to the 90Y-labeled antibody.  A dose 
of 5 mCi 111In-labeled antibody is one that balances safety and imaging efficiency.[63-66]  Characteristics 
of 90Y and 131I are summarized in  Table1.

1.D.1
  Iodine -131 Anti- B1 Antibody Clinical Experience  
In the initial Phase I/II, open- label study of non- myeloablative doses of Iodine -131 anti -B1 
antibody for the treatment of patients with B -cell NHL of all  histologic types, [67-69]  59  patients were 
enrolled.  Twenty -eight patients had low -grade NHL, 14 had transformed low -grade NHL, 15 had 
intermediate -grade NHL, and 2 had high- grade NHL.  The median time from diagnosis was 45 months, 
the median number of  prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_100232], 88% had stage III or IV disease, 36% had bulky disease, 
51% had an elevated LDH, and 24% had failed bone marrow transplant (BMT).  Patients received one to three dosimetric doses followed by a therapeutic dose.  The dosimetric dose(s) involved the IV administration of 5 mCi of Iodine -131 anti -B1 antibody to determine the rate of whole body clearance so 
that a whole body radiation dose (cGy) could be calculated.  Each dosimetric dose was preceded by 0, 95, or 475 mg of unlabeled antibody.  Therapeutic dose -escalation was initiated at 25 cGy and adjusted 
in 10 cGy increments until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached.  Fifty -three of the [ADDRESS_110377] 2000, a response was observed in 42/59 (71%) patients and a complete response (CR) was observed in 20/59 (34%) patients.  The median progression free survival (PFS) was 12 months for responders and 20.3 months for those who achieved a CR.  Seven of the 59 patients were in CR at time of publication.  Responses were observed in 50% of post -BMT patients and 
52% of bulky disease patients.  A response was observed in 24/28 (86%) patients and a CR was observed in 13/28 (46%) patients with low -grade NHL.  A response was observed in 11/14 (79%) 
patients and a CR was observed in 7/14 (50%) patients with transformed low -grade NHL.  Dose -
dependent pharmacokinetics were observed.  The mean tumor dose was 14.5 times the whole body dose.  
The dose -limiting toxicity was hematologic: three patients developed a platelet count < 10,000 
cells/mm
3 and two patients had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 100 cells/mm3.  The most 
prevalent non- hematologic toxicities were transien t, mild to moderate fever, nausea, asthenia, and chills.  
Ten of 59 (17%) patients developed human anti-murine antibodies (HAMA).    In the Phase II, multicenter, (dosimetry validation) open- label study of non- myeloablative doses of 
Iodine- 131 anti -B1 anti body for the treatment of patients with low -grade B -cell lymphomas and 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [11] transformed low -grade lymphomas, [70]  37 patients had low -grade NHL and 10 had transformed low -
grade NHL.  The median time from diagnosis was 41 months, the median number of prior ther api[INVESTIGATOR_100233], 91% had Stage III or IV disease, 44% had bulky disease, 44% had an elevated LDH.  Patients 
received one dosimetric dose followed by a therapeutic dose.  The dosimetric dose involved the IV administration of 450 mg of unlabeled antibody and 35 mg (5 mCi) of Iodine -131 anti -B1 antibody to 
determine the rate of whole body clearance so that a whole body radiation dose (cGy) could be calculated.  The therapeutic dose involved IV administration of 450 mg of unlabeled antibody and 35 mg of Iodine -131 anti -B1 antibody with radioactive Iodine -131 titrated to deliver 75 cGy.  Forty -five of the 
47 patients received a single dosimetric and therapeutic dose of Iodine -131 anti -B1 antibody as 
described in the protocol.  A response was observed in 27/47 (57% ) patients and a complete response 
(CR) was observed in 14/47 (30%) patients.  The median duration of response was 248 days (95% confidence interval: 136 days to upper limit not reached) and median duration of CR was not reached (95% with ongoing responses  ranging from 245- 606 days.  A CR was observed in 9/37 (24%) patients 
with low -grade NHL.  A response was observed in 6/10 (60%) patients and a CR was observed in 5/10 
(50%) patients with transformed NHL.  The mean tumor dose was 10.6 times the whole body dose.  The dose- limiting toxicity was hematologic:  five patients developed a platelet count <10,000 cells/mm3 and, 
mild to moderate asthenia, nausea and fever.  Only one of 46 (2%) patients developed HAMA following treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_100280].  
 Press and colleagues studied myeloablative doses of the same radioiodinated antibody (anti -B1, Coulter 
Pharmaceuticals) with autologous stem cell support in Phase I and II trials in Seattle. 
[71,72]  Twenty -nine 
patients with multiple r elapsed B cell lymphomas were treated with single agent I -131- anti-CD20 (B1) 
antibody (2.5 mg/kg, 280 to 785 mCi) followed by [CONTACT_100281] 2/90 and 7/94.  Objective responses occurred in 86% of patients, including 79% c omplete responses.  
Early toxicities included Grade 4 myelosuppression in all patients, Grade 2- 3 nausea in 8 of 29, and fatal 
sepsis in one.  Reversible cardiopulmonary failure was the dose -limiting non -hematopoietic toxicity (2 
pt.), occurring at an estimated absorbed lung dose of 27 Gy.  Overall survival and progression- free 
surviving patients had long -term objective impairment of performance status or cardiopulmonary 
function, though one patient with a pre -existing anthracycline -induced cardiomyopathy remained on 
digoxin (with an ejection fraction of 69%) four years after radioimmunotherapy.  No serious delayed cardiopulmonary complications occurred.  Late toxicities were minimal, except for elevation of the thyroid stimulating hormone level in 59% of the subjects.  Two patients who had been heavily pretreated with alkylating agents and external beam irradiation developed acute leukemia eight years after radioimmunotherapy.  Two patients developed secondary solid neoplasms 3 years after treatment (1 noninvasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder; 1 metastatic colon cancer).  
 
In SWOG 9911, 90 eligible previously untreated patients with advanced indolent lymphoma treated with 
six cycles of CHOP followed 4 -8 weeks later by [CONTACT_60840]/iodine I 131 tos itumomab (anti-CD20 
antibody) 
[73, 74] had an overall response rate to the entire treatment regimen of 90%, including 67% 
complete remissions and 23% partial remissions. Twenty -seven (57%) of the 47 fully evaluable patients 
who achieved less than a CR with  CHOP had an improved remission status after tositumomab/iodine I 
131 tositumomab.  With a median follow-up of 2.3 years, the 2- year progression -free survival was 
estimated to be 81%, with a 2- year overall survival of 97%.   Treatment was well tolerated.  Reversible 
myelosuppression was the main adverse event and was more severe during CHOP chemotherapy than following radioimmunotherapy.   As noted above, CHOP plus I –131 tositumomab is being evaluated 
further in advanced previously untreated indolent lymphoma in the randomized, phase III trial S0016.

 [12] 1 D. 2 90Y Zevalin  
a.  Background 
90Y Zevalin  is a unique compound composed of the following: a murine IgG1 kappa 
monoclonal antibody ibritumomab (IDEC -2B8); the linker chelator tiuxetan 
(isothiocyanatobenzyl MX -DTPA); and the radioisotope 90Y that is securely chelated via the 
linker.  Like its unlabeled chimeric counterpart, rituximab, 90Y Zevalin targets the CD20 antigen 
present on 95% of B cell lymphomas.[75]  111In Zevalin is the 111Indium- labeled murine 
monoclonal antibody used for imaging and dosimetry.  Rituximab, a chimeric mouse/human 
antibody, is given initially to clear peripheral B  lymphocytes and optimize biodistribution of the 
radiolabeled antibody. 
In single -dose safety studies with  ibritumomab (IDEC -2B8) performed in mice and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], 
no overt toxicity was seen within seven days of dosing.  Tumor localization studies with 111In 
Zevalin performed in athymic mice demonstrated that concentrations of 111In Zevalin increased 
steadily  in tumor, but did not accumulate in blood or other tissues.  Biodistribution studies 
performed in mice with 90Y Zevalin demonstrated minimal bone accumulation ( < 1.5% injected 
dose/gram after 3 days).  
b. Zevalin® Clinical Experience 
Zevalin radioimmunotherapy has been evaluated in seven clinical trials  (see Table 2). The 
first two trials (106 -01 and 106-02) differed from subsequent trials in the following ways: 
• The murine ibritumomab antibody was used instead of the chimeric rituximab antibody as the 
cold antibody infused prior to Zevalin 
• Dosing was based on total mCi rather than mCi/kg 
• Stem cells were collected prior to radioimmunotherapy  
Because of these differences, [ADDRESS_110378] been excluded from the integrated safety 
summary .

b.1 Summary of Safety Results  
The safety profile of Zevalin is summarized for patients who received 90Y Zevalin  
as a mCi/kg dose in five clinical trials (106 -03, 106- 04, 106- 05, 106- 06, 106- 98; N  = 349).  Results 
revealed that adverse events (AEs ) are primarily hematologic with Grade  4 neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurring in 30%, 10% and 4.0% of patients, respectively. Most 
nonhematologic AEs were Grade 1 or 2 and the incidence was comparable to that seen with rituximab therapy.  Median serum immunoglobulins remain largely within the normal range and a low incidence of severe infection was noted despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 6 -month reversible depletion of B cells.  Incidence of 
HAMA/HACA is low and a HAMA or HACA response did not result in unusual toxi city.  
Myelodysplasia has been reported for 1.4% of patients, well within the expected background rate for this heavily pretreated patient population.

b.2 Summary of Efficacy Results 
Knox administered Yttrium-90- labeled anti -CD20  antibodies to 18 patients with  
relapsed B cell lymphomas (4 treated with Y -90-tositumomab antibody and 14 with ibritumomab 
tiuxetan) in escalating single doses of 13.5 to 50 mCi.[77]  Six complete remissions and seven partial 
responses were observed (overall response rate, 72%), with a median response duration of 6 months.  Four patients developed human anti -mouse antibodies (HAMA).  Grade 4 myelosuppression was seen at 
doses above 50 mCi of 7-90, but no other serious toxicities were observed.    
In a multi- center Phase I/II  trial dose -finding study (106- 03), Witzig et al treated  
51 patients with relapsed or re fractory non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma with Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Y2B8, 
Zevalen).[78]  Eligibility criteria included an ANC > 1,500/mm3, platelets > 100,000/mm3 and bone 
marr ow involvement < 25%.  Median age was 60 years.  Patients had a median of two prior regimens 
(range, 1 -7).  In the phase I portion of the trial, patients received either 100 or 250 mg/m2 of unlabeled 
rituximab (to clear peripheral B -cells and improve biodistribution) followed by [CONTACT_100282] -111-
ibritumomab tiuxetan (5 mCi on Day 1 for imaging and Y -90-ibitumomab tiuxetan 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 
mCi/kg on Day 8.  The optimal dose of unlabeled rituximab was determined to be 250 mg/m2 and 0.4 mCi/kg was the maximally tole rated dose of Yttrium -90.  In an intent -to- treat analysis the overall 
response rate was 67%, including 26% CRs and 41% PRs.  Thirty -four patients with low grade 
lymphoma achieved an 82% overall response rate  (26% CRs, 56% PRs), 43% of [ADDRESS_110379] common 
hematologic event.  Hematologic toxicity was transient and reversible.  Only one patient developed an immune response. 
 
Witzig et al [79,80] (106- 04) conducted a randomized phase III trial in 143 patients with relapsed 
or refractory low -grade, follicular, or CD 20+ transformed NHL.  Patients received either ibritumomab 
tiuxetan, 0.4 mCi/kg (maximum of 32 mCi) or rituximab, 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks.  Eligibility required an ANC > 1,500/mm3, a platelet count > 100,000/mm3, and bone marrow involvement < 25%.  
As assessed by [CONTACT_100283], [81] patients who received ibritumomab 
tiuxetan achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 80% (73 patients) compared with 56% (70 patients) for patients on the rituximab arm (p = 0.002).  Complete response (CR) rates were 30% for the ibritumomab tiuxetan group and 16% for the rituximab group (p = 0.04), with an additional 4% of 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [14] patients in each arm achieving an unconfirmed CR.  The estimated (Kaplan -Meier) median du ration of 
response was 14.2 months versus 12.1 months, respectively (p = 0.6) and time to progression (TTP) was 
11.2 versus 10.1 months, respectively (p = 0.173).  For the 113 patients with follicular histology (113 of the 143 patients), the overall response rate was 86% in the 90 -Y- ibritumomab tiuxetan group versus 
55% in the rituximab group (P < 0.001), and the estimated median TTP was 12.6 months for the 90-Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan group and 10.2 months for the rituximab group (P = 0.062). The estimated m edian 
DR for patients with follicular lymphoma patients treated with 90 -Y ibritumomab tiuxetan was 18.5 
months versus 12.1 months for the rituximab control group (P = 0.371.   Durable responses of > 6 
months were 64% versus 47% (P = 0.030), respectively.  Although the differences in duration of response and TTP were not significant between arms, ORR and CR were significantly higher in the ibritumomab tiuxetan group.  Time to progression was longer in CR/CRu patients treated with 90-Y-ibritumomab.   Within the group of patients with follicular lymphoma 74% had DR >  6 months, 59% > 
9 months, and 47% > 12 months on the 90-Y- ibritumomab tiuxetan arm.  Reversible hematologic 
toxicity was seen in patients treated with ibritumomab tiuxetan.   
  
In an open- label tr ial, [82, 82a] 54 patients with follicular lymphoma were accrued to learn whether 
patients who had failed to achieve a partial remission or CR (complete response) to rituximab or had a response that lasted less than 6 months would respond to radioimmunotherapy with Y -90-ibritumomab 
tiuxetan.  The median age was 54 years and patients had received a median of four prior regimens.  Forty -four percent of patients had bulky disease (defined as > 7 cm) and 32% had bone marrow 
involvement.  Using the International  Workshop Response Criteria, the overall response rate was 74% 
with Y -90-ibritumomab tiuxetan and the complete response rate was 15%.  The duration of response was 
7.7 months for ibritumomab tiuxetan compared to 4 months for prior rituximab in these patients (p < 0.001).  Median time to progression had not been reached at the time of the report.  
 
A fourth study, based on findings in the phase I portion of Study 106- 03, confirmed the safety of 
the dose of 0.3 mCi/kg (11 MBq/kg) (maximum 32 mCi (1.2 GBq) in patients with mild 
thrombocytopenia (100,000 to 149,000 platelets/mm3) and demonstrated significant clinical activity in this population with an 83% ORR (37% complete response, 6.7% complete response unconfirmed, and 40% partial response as assessed by [CONTACT_100284]). 
[83]   Patients with follicular  
lymphoma had an overall response rate of 92%, and estimated median TTP of 10.8 months (12.6 months for responders).  
 
Long- term follow-up information for the patients with B -cell NHL from the four registrational 
trials of Zevalin conducted between 1996 and 1999 has become available.   In 2002, Gordon et al 
[84] reported on long- term follow-up of the patients with diffuse mixed and diffuse 
large cell lymphoma (all of whom had had prior CHOP or CHO P-like regimens) treated in the phase I/II 
study. The median age of this group was 58 years and the overall response rate was 58% (33% CRs).  At 35.5 months of follow-up (range, 2.4- 40+ months), the median duration of response had not been 
reached.  Toxici ty was primarily hematologic with Grade 4 neutropenia in 17% and thrombocytopenia in 
8%.  Hematologic toxicity was reversible.  
 
More recently 
[85] follow-up for the entire group of 51 patients in the phase I/II study was 
reported. The overall response rat e (ORR) in all patients was 73% (51% CR/Cru, 22% PR).  The ORR in 
patients with follicular lymphoma was 85% and 58% in patients with diffuse large B -cell lymphoma.  
Median time to progression (TTP) in responders was 12.[ADDRESS_110380] was 11.7 months.  Median 
TTP and duration of response (DR) for CR/Cru patients were 13.4 months and 12.4 months, 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [15] respectively.  Median TTP and DR for CR/Cru patients treated at the 0.4 mCi/kg (14.8 MBq/kg) dose 
were 28.[ADDRESS_110381] for pa tients in CR who were treated at 
the 0.4 mCi/kg (14.8 MBq/kg) dose was 45.[ADDRESS_110382] in DLCL group is that the rapid progression in the nonresponders lowered the median TTP.  Median follow-up in this study is 28.5 months for all patients and 63 months for ongoing responder s.  Nine 
patients (24% of responding patients) (five with FL and four with DLCL) had a TTP of more than 3 years.  Five of the 9 patients (14% of all responders) (3 with FL and 2 with DLCL) are still in remission (DR range, 60-70+ months).     
Schilder et al 
[86] provide long- term follow-up data for the 211 patients with B -cell NHL treated 
in the four registrational trials of 90 -Y ibritumomab conducted between 1996 and 1999.  Of these 
patients, 153 patients (73%) had follicular lymphoma (FL).  With ongoing follow-up, long- term durable 
responses (> 12 months) were reported for 37% of all 211 patients and for 39% of patients with follicular lymphoma.   Median DR and TTP for long- term responder patients were 28 months (range, 11-
80) and 29 months (range, 12-82), respectively, with a median follow-up of 50 months (range, 13-82).  
The median DR to the last prior therapy for LTR patients was 12 months.  The CR and CRu among LTR patients was 65%, and the median DR and TTP were 29 and 31 months, respectively, for CR/C Ru 
patients.  In ongoing responders, the median DR is 52 months (range, 48- 80).  Compared to the overall 
LTR patients, LTR patients with FL had similar disease characteristics, DR, TTP, and CR/CRu rates.  Failure to respond to the therapy given immediately  prior to treatment with Zevalin did not appear to 
affect the ability to achieve long -term responses with the agent.    
  
c. Summary of Dosimetry Results  
Dosimetry has been performed on a total of 205 patients.  A central analysis of the dosimetry 
data was co mpleted for 179 of those patients.  Initial MIRDOSE3 estimates of radiation absorbed dose to 
uninvolved organs and red marrow, completed at the clinical site, were used to determine patient eligibility for RIT.  All patients studied with dosimetry met the protocol defined criteria for proceeding 
with 
90Y Zevalin treatment, with estimated radiation absorbed doses below the maximum allowable of 
2000 cGy for uninvolved organs and 300 cGy for red marrow.  Subsequent to 90Y Zevalin treatment, a 
central dosimetry  analysis was performed by a collaboration between Oak Ridge Associated Universities 
(ORAU) and the Mayo Clinic. This provided a uniform analysis of the patient blood and imaging data. 
A 5 mCi tracer dose of 111In Zevalin was used for imaging and dosimetry.  The radiation 
absorbed doses from 111In Zevalin and 90Y Zevalin were estimated from blood and imaging data 
obtained during the week following 111In Zevalin injection.  The radiation absorbed doses from 111In 
Zevalin were minimal.  The median estimated r adiation absorbed doses from 5 mCi 111In Zevalin were 
15 cGy to spleen, 11 cGy to liver, 5 cGy to lungs, 3 cGy to kidneys, and 2 cGy to red marrow.  The radiation absorbed doses from 
90Y Zevalin were more significant.  The median radiation absorbed doses 
from 90Y Zevalin were 742  cGy to spleen, 450 cGy to liver, 211 cGy to lungs, 23 cGy to kidneys, and 62 
cGy to red marrow.  The mean whole blood effective half- life of 90Y Zevalin was 27 +/ - 5 hours. 
Hematologic toxicity did not correlate with any of the dos imetric or pharmacokinetic parameters 
analyzed, including blood derived red marrow dose, sacral image -derived red marrow dose, total body 
dose, blood effective half -life, or blood AUC.  Patients were effectively screened for safe treatment 
using clinical s election criteria including percent bone marrow involvement with NHL ( < 25%), baseline 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [16] platelet count ( > 100,000 cells/mm3).  Patients were treated safely using individualized dosing based on 
patient weight and platelet count.  
These findings indicate that  dosimetry is not necessary for the safe administration of 90Y Zevalin 
in this defined patient population. 
 
1.E Rationale for Current Protocol  
As detailed above, radioimmunoconjugates are effective treatments  in relapsed/refractory follicular 
lymphoma when used as single agents and can result in prolonged disease control.  These remissions can 
be extremely durable in patients with the greatest reduction in tumor burden.  Radioimmunoconjugates 
used as consolidative treatment following a course of initial che motherapy for patients with newly 
discovered follicular lymphoma produce durable remissions and appear to have changed the overall survival in this disease for the first time in [ADDRESS_110383] shown that the r esponse rate is greater in individuals 
with decreased disease burden.  In the University of Michigan experience of 59 patients treated for relapsed NHL, those with non- bulky disease had a higher response (82%) than did those with bulky 
disease (52%).  Complete response was better in patients with no bulk vs. bulky disease, 37% vs. 29% respectively. 
[87]  A multicenter phase III study published in 2001 demonstrated similar results.  This 
study showed that patients with decreased tumor burden had improved response (81%) vs. patients with greater tumor burden (39%). 
[88] Finally, a recently published study of I -131 tositumomab in recurrent 
indolent and transformed B -cell NHL showed again the importance of reduced tumor volume.  In this 
study patients with decreased tumor mass had a 100% overall response rate (ORR) vs. a 60% ORR in patients with increased tumor mass. 
[89]   
 Long- term outcome information for patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma treated with Y -
90-ibritumomab tiuxetan indicates that durable long- term responses (> 5 years) can be obtained in a 
significant proportion of patients with follicular lymphoma and that improvements in CR rates improve 
TTP. 
[85, 86]  
 
The recent analysis by [CONTACT_100285]- term outcomes obtained in sequential 
Southwest Oncology Group clinical trials for previously untreated indolent lymphoma since 1974, [90] 
clearly demonstrates the impact of monoclonal antibody therapy in the management of follicular 
lymphoma.    In this analysis, all previously untreated, advanced stage follicular lymphoma patients treated with three sequential treatment approaches (CHOP chemotherapy +/ - non- specific 
immunostimulants (SWOG 7426 and 7713, 1974- 1978); ProMACE -MOPP +/ - interferon (SWOG 8809, 
1988- 1994); and CHOP followed by [CONTACT_100286] (MoAb) therapy (SWOG 9800 [CHOP -
Rituximab] and SWOG 9911 [CHOP -I-131 tositumomab, 1998- 2000) were evaluated for 4- year 
progression free survival (PFS) and 4- year overall survival (OS) by [CONTACT_100287].  Results are 
shown below in Tables 3a and 3b. 
 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [17] TABLE 3a.  
Progression -Free Survival by [CONTACT_100288]  N DEATH/PROGRESSION  4-YR PFS  
CHOP + MoAb  179 75 61%

CHOP  356 257 46% 
 
TABLE 3b.  
Overall Survival by [CONTACT_100289]  N DEATH     4-YR OS  
CHOP + MoAb  179 18 91% 
ProMACE  425 189 79% 
CHOP  356 226 69% 
 
These results demonstrate that PFS remained unchanged until the recent studies that utilized CHOP followed by a monoclonal antibody for initial treatment.  In contrast to PFS , OS has increased with each 
subsequent treatment strategy.  These data are consistent with the hypotheses that initial therapy with chemotherapy followed by a monoclonal antibody has significant impact on PFS (p = 0.005) and OS (p < 0.0001). 
[90]  
 Our hy pothesis is that radioimmunocongugates significantly change outcome for patients with follicular 
lymphoma when given in the situation of minimal residual disease.   We propose to test this hypothesis prospectively in previously treated patients using a pha se II trial design evaluating the combination of 
ESHAP chemotherapy (methylprednisolone, etoposide, cisplatin, cytarabine) followed by [CONTACT_100290].  For 
this prospective test of cytoreduction of the tumor burden followed by [CONTACT_100291], an outpatient formulation of ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) will be used as a means of reducing the mass of disease.  We propose to use this regimen for a few reasons.  First, ESHAP has very good efficacy as a salvage regimen in  treating relapsed low -grade lymphomas.  
One study 
[35] showed a 75% ORR and 36% CR rate in patients with relapsed disease.  
 Second, although ESHAP is very active in low -grade NHL, it is not often utilized by [CONTACT_100292] a salvage regimen.  Therefore, most pretreated patients have not seen these agents and therefore their lymphomas should be responsive to ESHAP.  After treatment with two cycles of preparative ESHAP most patients should have minimal residual disease and therefore have higher response to Zevalin.  It is our hypothesis that tumor mass reduction with standard chemotherapy in 
relapsed follicular lymphoma will result in a significant prolongation of time to progression following Zevalin therapy, changing the natural history of relaps ed disease.  
  The TTP and OS results of this study will be compared with reported outcomes in published trials of Zevalin alone to assess whether there is sufficient improvement to merit further study of this approach in this setting.  We have designed the  trial to detect an increase in 1 -year PFS from a historical value of 
50% to 67.3%, which corresponds to an increase in median TTP from 12 months to 21 months.

 [24] 5.C Evaluations During the Zevalin Imaging & Treatment  Period  
Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Indium (111In Zevalin) r egimen is administered 4 – 6 weeks after completion of 
ESHAP.  
 
5.C.1 Day 1 
a. History  & Physical examination, including vital signs ( BP, temperature & pulse),  
height, weight, Body Surface Area (BSA), and performance status are to be 
performed within 28 days of Rituximab & Zevalin administration.   (Appendix B). 
b. Toxicity Assessment: Adverse events are to be recorded on an ongoing  
basis and on appropriate source documents at the clinical site and in the patient's 
case report form.  
c. Laboratory tests including:  
• Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count  
• Serum chemistries - BU N, creatinine 
 
The above mentioned tests and assessment are to be performed within 28 days of 
Rituximab & Zevalin administration.  
 d. Rituxaimab Infusion (250 mg/m
2) &  111In Zevalin (Ibritu momab Tiuxetan Indium) 
infusion. (Please refer to section 7.B for detailed treatment administration)  
5.C.2 Days 2, 3, 4 and 5 
a. Gamma Scan : A scan is to be performed at 48 -72 hours after 111In Zevalin 
(Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Indium) infusion. Another optional scan may be performed at 90-120 hours after 
111In Zevalin (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Indium) infusion.  
CAUTION WILL BE TAKEN IN THE HANDLING OF ALL RADIOACTIVE SAMPLES ACCORDING TO STANDARD PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES AT THE CLINICAL SITE.  
The purpose of 
111In Zevalin (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Indium) imaging is twofold: 
• To eval uate biodistribution of whole body gamma camera images 
• To assess whether biodistribution is acceptable to proceed with 90Y Zevalin (Ibritumomab 
Tiuxetan Ytrium-90) radioimmunotherapy. 
 
The biodistribution of 111In Zevalin (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Indium)  should be assessed by a 
visual evaluation of whole body planar view anterior and posterior gamma images .  A set of images at 
48-72 hours after injection is required.  To resolve ambiguities, optional images at other time points may 
be necessary.  Images should  be acquired using a large field of view gamma camera quipped with  a 
medium energy collimator.  Whole body anterior/posterior planar images should be acquired using a large field -of-view gamma camera and medium energy collimators.  Suggested gamma camera s ettings: 
256 x 1024 matrix; dual energy photopeaks set at 172 and 247 keV; 15% symmetric window; scan speed of 10 cm/min for the 48 -72 hour scan, and 7-10 cm/min for subsequent scans.  
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [25]  Expected biodistribution: 
• Activity in the blood pool areas (heart, abdomen, neck, and extremities) may be faintly 
visible.  
• Moderately high to high uptake in normal liver and spleen. 
• Moderately low or very low uptake in normal kidneys, urinary bladder, and normal (uninvolved) bowel. 
• Non-fixed areas within the bowel lumen that change position with time; delayed imaging 
as described above may be necessary to confirm gastrointestinal clearance.  
Tumor uptake may be visualized in soft tissue as areas of increased intensity, and tumor -bearing 
areas in normal organs may be seen as areas of increased or decreased intensity.  Tumor visualization on the 
111In Zevalin (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Indium)  scan is not required for 90Y Zevalin  (Ibritumomab 
Tiuxetan Ytrium-90) therapy.  
 Altered biodistribution  
• Intense localization of radiotracer in th e liver and spleen and bone marrow indicative of 
reticuloendothelial system uptake  
• Increased uptake in normal organs (not involved by [CONTACT_20150]) such as: 
o Diffuse uptake in normal lung more intense than the liver. 
o Kidneys with greater intensity than the liver o n the posterior view. 
o Fixed areas (unchanged with time) of uptake in the normal bowel greater than uptake in the liver. 
o In less than 0.5% of patients receiving 
111In Zevalin  (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan 
Indium) , prominent bone marrow uptake was observed, characte rized by [CONTACT_100298]. 
If a visual inspection of the gamma images reveals an altered biodistribution, the patient should 
not proceed to the 90Y Zevalin  (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Ytrium-90) dose.  The safety and efficacy of the 
administration of 90Y Zevalin (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Ytrium-90) in patients with prominent marrow 
uptake is not known.  Possible causes of prominent bone marrow uptake, such as bone marrow involvement by [CONTACT_56927], increased marrow activity due to recent hem atopoietic growth factor 
administration, and increased reticuloendothelial uptake in patients with HAMA and HACA, should be considered.  Re -assessment of biodistribution after correction of underlying factors should be performed.  
90Y Zevalin (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan Ytrium-90) should not be administered to patients with persistently 
prominent marrow uptake on the repeat biodistribution scans.

6 DRUG INFORMATION 
 
6.A. ESHAP Regimen Drug Information 
6.A.1.  Cisplatin (CDDP) (Platinol ) (NSC -119875)  
a. DESCRIPTION  Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (Patinol or cisplatin) is a heavy metal complex 
and is water -soluble.  It is a white lyophilized powder with a molecular weight of 
300.1. 
b. TOXICOLOGY 
Human Toxicology:  Human toxicity includes anorexia, nausea, vomiting, renal 
toxicity (with an elevation of BUN, creatinine, serum uric acid and impairment of endogenous creatinine clearance, as well as renal tubular damage), ototoxicity (with hearing loss which initially is in the high -frequency range, as well as 
tinnitus), peripheral neuropathy and hyperuricemia.  Much mor e severe and 
prolonged toxicity has been observed in patients with abnormal or obstructed urinary excretory tracts.  Raynaud’s phenomena and digital ischemia has been described.  Anaphylactic -like reactions including facial edema, 
bronchoconstriction, tachycardia and hypotension may occur within minutes of administration.  Myelosuppression, often with delayed erythrosuppression, is expected.  In the high- dose treatment regimen with osmotic diuresis, the nadir of 
white cells and platelets occurred regularly at about two weeks with recovery 
generally at about three weeks after the initiation of therapy.  Rare complications are alopecia, seizures, loss of taste and allergic reactions.  Tetany may occur due to hypomagnesemia and/or hypocalcemia.  Other electroly te disturbances may 
occur.  At high doses patients have experienced optic neuritis, papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], cerebral blindness, blurred vision, and altered color perception.  Patients have also experienced cardiac abnormalities, elevated SGOT and rash.  Subsequent co urses 
should not be given until serum creatinine returns to normal if elevated.  Audiometric analyses should be monitored and courses withheld until auditory acuity is within normal limits.  The occurrence of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in pati ents treated with anthracycline/alkylator combination 
chemotherapy.  
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [29]  
Pregnancy and Lactation:  Cisplatin can cause fetal harm when administered  to a 
pregnant woman.  In mice, cisplatin is teratogenic and embryotoxic.  No 
information is available on the excretion of this drug in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued. 
 
c. PHARMACOLOGY 
Kinetics :  After a single IV dose , increased concentration is found in the liver, 
kidneys and a small and large intestines.  Plasma levels of cisplatin decay in a biphasic mode with an initial half -life of 25 -49 minutes, and a secondary phase 
ranging from 58 to 73 hours.  This prolonged phase is due to protein binding which exceeds 90% of the radioactivity in the second phase.  Urinary excretion is incomplete with only 27 to 43% of the radioactivity excreted in the first five days.  The initial fractions of radioactivity are largely unchan ged drugs.  Although this 
drug seems to act as an alkylating agent, there are data to indicate that its mode and sites of actions are different from those of nitrogen mustard and the standard alkylating agents.  Cisplatin penetrates into CNS poorly.    
 
Formulation :  Cisplatin is available as 10 mg and 50 mg vials of dry powder 
which are reconstituted with 10 ml and 50 ml of Sterile Water for Injection USP, respectively.  Cisplatin is also available as an aqueous solution, 1 mg/ml, in 50 or 100 ml vials. 
 
Storage and Stability:  The intact vials may be stored at room temperature (15 -25 
degrees C) for the lot life indicated on the package.  Do not refrigerate.  Once reconstituted, the solution should be kept at room temperature to avoid precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332].  The re constituted solution is stable for 20 hours at room 
temperature, although, due to lack of preservatives, the solution should be used within eight hours of reconstitution.  The solution may be further diluted in a chloride- containing vehicle such as D5NS, NS, or D5- 1/2 NS (precipi[INVESTIGATOR_100238] D5w).  
 
Administration :  In this protocol, cisplatin will be given immediately after 
preparation as an intravenous infusion over a [ADDRESS_110404] with 
cisplatinum (Platinol) should not be used for preparation or administration, as a black precipi[INVESTIGATOR_100239] 30 minutes.  
 
Supplier:  Cisplatin is commercially available for purchase by a third party.   
 
6.A.2     Cytosine Arabinoside (Ara -C) (Cytarabine) (Cytosar U) (NSC -[ZIP_CODE])  
a. DESCRIPTION  
Ara-C is chemically 4 -amino -1-S-D- arabino -furanosyl- 2 (1H) -primidinone.  Ara -
C is metabolized to its active form, ara -CTP.  The ara- CTP functions as an 
inhibitor of DNA polymerase.  Ara -C exhibits cell phase specificity, killing cells 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [30] undergoing DNA synthesis (S phase) and may also block cells from progressing to 
S phase from G1.  Extensive chromosomal damage, including chromatid breaks, occurs.  Ara-C appears to be most effective in tumors with high growth fraction.  
b. TOXICOLOGY 
Human Toxicology :  Side effects of ara- C include myelosuppression, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, anal ulceration, stomatitis, rash, headache, fever, myalgia, malaise, bone pain, chest pain, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and alopecia.  Central nervous system toxicity, i.e., signician cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, progression to coma, has been seen with high doses.  Severe cardiomyopathy has been reported with high dose ara -C in combination with 
cyclophosphamide.  Progressive ascending paralysis has occurred in two patients 
receiving IV and intrathecal ara- C.  Marked keratoconjuncitivitis has also 
occurred with high doses.   
 
The most frequently reported reactions after intrathecal administration were nausea, vomit ing and fever.  Paraplegia and meningitis has been reported with 
intrathecal administration.  Ara -C given intrathecally may cause systemic toxicity 
and careful monitoring of the hemopoietic system is indicated.  If used intrathecally of if high dose therapy is used, do not  use a diluent containing benzyl 
alcohol. 
 Ara-c can cause fetal harm when administered  to a pregnant woman, however, 
there are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women. 
 
c. PHARMACOLOGY 
Kinetics :  Ara -C is metabolized by [CONTACT_100301], which is an active inhibitor of DNA polymerase.  Deoxyccytidine prevents or delays cytotoxic activity.  The active form is converted to nontoxic uracil derivatives by [CONTACT_100302].  The balance of kinase and deaminase levels appears to be an important factor in sensitivity/resistance of the cell to ara -C.  After IV injection, plasma 
disappearance of ara- C is biphasic.  Initial half -life is 10 minutes, delayed half -life 
if 1-3 hours.  After 24 hours, 80% is excreted in the urine as its inactive 
metabolite, ara -U.  After a single IV administration  of ara -C, levels in CSF are 
low.  With intrathecal administration, half- life is 2 hours.  There is little 
conversion to ara -U because of low CSF levels of diaminase.  Drug interaction of 
ara-C has been reported with digoxin, gentamycin and fluorocytocine. 
 
Formulation:   Ara -C is supplied as a sterile powder in 100 mg and 500 mg vials 
for injection.  Ara -C is also available in 1 and 2 gram vials.  The drug should be 
reconstituted with sterile water for injection.  
 
Storage and Stability:  The sterile powder should be stored at room temperature 15 
degrees to 30 degrees C (59 -86 degrees).  The resulting solution has a stability of 
48 hour s if stored at ROOM TEMPERATURE .  Do not use if even a slight haze 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [31] develops.  The reconstituted solution may be further diluted in 5% Dextrose or 
sodium chloride injection.  
Administration:  Ara -C is usually administered by [CONTACT_100303], but IV 
bolus and subcutaneous use have their place in treating certain leukemic responses (i.e., maintenance or remission). 
 
Supplier:    Ara -C is commercially available and therefore should be purchased by 
[CONTACT_31403].   
 
6.A.3     Etoposide (VP- 16) (Vespesid)  (Ethylidene -Lignan P.) (NSC-141540)  
a.      DESCRIPTION  
   Chemistry:  VP 16 is a semi-synthetic podophyllotoxin derivative  
from the plant podophyllum pletatum, and has antineoplastic properties in experimental animals, and in man.  The empi[INVESTIGATOR_100240] C29H32O13 has a molecular weight of 588.  
Mechanism of Action :  The epi[INVESTIGATOR_100241], but in contrast to the vinca -alkaloids, have 
an additional activity of inhibiting cells from entering mitosis.  Suppression of titrated thymidine, uridine, and leucine incorporation in human cells in tissue culture suggests effects against DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. 
 
Animal Tumor Data :  Significant antitumor effect has been demonstrated in 
L1210, mouse  sarcoma [ADDRESS_110405] intracerebrally inoculated 1210. 
 
b.      TOXICOLOGY 
Animal Toxicology :  The predominant toxicities of VP -[ADDRESS_110406] been complicated by [CONTACT_100304].  The LD-50 of the solvent plus drug approached that of the solvent alone.  
Immunosuppressive effects occur with an inhibition of antibody production in mice and monkeys, and prevention of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in rats (cell -mediated immunity).  
 
Human Toxicology :  Reversible myelotoxicity has been uniformly observed to be 
the major toxicity of VP -[ADDRESS_110407].  Following a single IV injection, peak myelotoxicity occurs at seven  to nine 
days.   Following daily IV injections for five to seven days, myelotoxicity is maximal between 12 – 16 days from the initiation of therapy.  Bone marrow 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [32] suppression is mainly manifested as granulocytopenia, with thrombocytopenia 
transient modest n ausea, vomiting and diarrhea, are common.  Other reactions 
could include aftertaste, rash, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], pruritis, abdominal pain, constipation and dysphagia.  Occasional alopecia is reported.  VP -[ADDRESS_110408] a 30 -minute period.  Occasionally, chills, fever, peripheral 
neurotoxicity, stomatitis, hepatotoxicity, transient cortic al blindness and radiation 
recall dermatitis may be a result of VP -16 administration.  The occurrence of 
acute leukemia has been reported rarely in patients treated with VP -16 in 
association with other anti -neoplastic agents.  VP -16 can cause fetal harm wh en 
administered to pregnant women.  
Pregnancy and Lactation :  Etoposide can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman.  Etoposide has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rats.  In these studies, etoposide caused dose -related maternal toxi city, embryotoxicity, 
and teratogenicity.  Fetal abnormalities included decreased weight, major skeletal abnormalities, exencephaly, encephalocele, anopthalmia, and retarded ossification.  No information is available on excretion of this drug in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued. 
 
c.      PHARMACOLOGY  
Kinetics :  After IV administration, disposition is biphasic with initial half -life of 
1.5 hours and terminal half -life of 4 – 11 hours.  Drug does not accumulate in 
plasma following daily administration of 100 mg/M2 for 4 – 5 days.  Drug crosses

6.A.4      Methylpredn isolone sodium succinate (Solu- Medrol)  
a. DESCRIPTION  
Methylprednisolone is a glucocorticoid that is given intravenously.   
 
b. TOXICOLOGY 
Human Toxicology:  Possible adverse effects associated with methylprednisolone 
are: fluid and electrolyte disturbances, cong estive heart failure in susceptible 
persons, hypertension, euphoria, personality changes, insomnia, mood swings, 
depression, exacerbation of infection (e.g., tuberculosis), exacerbation or symptoms of diabetes, psychosis, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, ver tebral 
compression fractures, pancreatitis, esophagitis, peptic ulcer, dermatologic disturbances, convulsions, vertigo and headache, endocrine abnormalities, ophthalmic changes, and metabolic changes.  Some patients have experienced itching and other allergic, anaphylactic or other symptoms including fever, myalgia and arthralgia.  Phenytoin, phenobarbitol and ephedrine enhance metabolic clearance of corticosteroids.   
 
Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with hypothyroidism, 
cirrhosis, oc ular herpes simplex, existing emotional instability or psychotic 
tendencies, nonspecific ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis and myasthenia gravis.  Immunization pr ocedures (especially smallpox vaccination) 
should not be undertaken in patients on corticosteroids.   
 
c. PHARMACOLOGY 
Kinetics: Methylprednisolone is extremely soluble in water.  It is well- suited for 
intravenous use and high levels are obtained rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].  Gl ucocorticoids have salt -
retaining properties.  The anti -inflammatory property of this drug is its ability to 
modify the body’s immune system.  On the other hand, glucocorticoids suppress the body’s response to viral as well as bacterial infections.  Equiva lent doses are 
as follows:  
 
Methylprednisolone  Dexamethasone  Prednisone  Hydrocortisone  Cortisone  
4 mg  0.75 mg  5 mg  20 mg  25 mg  
 
 
Formulation:   Several formulations are available.  Act -O-Vial comes in 40 
mg/mL, 125 mg/2 mL, and 500 mg/4 mL.  Another available formulation is 500 mg/8 mL.   
 
Storage and Stability: The unreconstituted product may be stored at room 
temperature 20 ° to 25° C.  The product in solution can also be stored at room 
temperature.  The solution must be used within [ADDRESS_110412] be protected from light.

6.B Rituximab Drug Information   6.B.1 DE SCRIPTION 
 Rituximab is a mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody consisting of human IgG1 heavy 
and kappa light chain constant regions with murine variable regions from the murine IgG1 kappa anti -
human CD20 monoclonal antibody ri tuximab. The rituximab an tibody is produced by a Chinese hamster  
ovary transfectoma.  
 
 6.B.2 TOXICOLOGY 
 Human Toxicology: Single doses of up to 500 mg/m2 and weekly x 4 doses of 375 mg/m2 have 
been administered without dose limiting toxicity. Adverse events are most common during  the in itial 
antibody infusion and usually consist of Grade 1, or 2 fever (73%), asthenia (16%), chills (38%), nausea 
(19%), vomiting (11%), rash (14%), and t umor site pain (3%). Grade 1 or 2 hypotension (8%) may be treated with IV fluids. Hematologic toxicity is usually mild and reversible. Transient decreases in the WBC or platelet count have been observed – especially in patients with high levels of circulating tumor 
cells or bone marrow involvement. Two patients have had late -onset Grade 4 neutropenia at four and ten 
months that was attributed to an unknown cause, were transient and resolved. Infections (Grade 1 and 2) have not been related to dose level. Symptoms are generally associated with the initial antibody infusions and diminish in frequency with each successive infusion. 
 
 Infusion Reaction: An infusion- related symptom complex consisting of fever and chills/rigors 
has occurred in the majority of patients during the first rituximab infusion. Other frequent infusion-related  symptoms include nausea , uticaria, fatigue, headache, pruritis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, sensation 
of tongue or throat swelling (angioedema), rhinitis, vomiting, hypotension, flushing, and pain at disease sites. These reactions generally occurred within [ADDRESS_110413] infusion, and resolved with slowing or interruption of the rituximab infusion and with supportive care (IV saline, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen). 
 
 Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Rituximab rapi[INVESTIGATOR_100244]20 positive  cells. 
Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported to occur within [ADDRESS_110414] rituximab infusion in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant lymphocytes. Patients with high tumor burden (bulky lesions) may also be at risk. Patients at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_100245]. 
 
Other viral infections :  The following additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated, or made 
more severe have been r eported in some patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  
These viral infections include JC virus (which can lead to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML], a rare and often fatal disease), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simp lex virus, parvovirus B19, 
varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C.  In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to 18 months  after discontinuation of the rituximab and resulted in death.  Because there are no warning 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [35] signs of PML, you should contact [CONTACT_100306], loss of balance or coordination, or periods of disorientation or 
confusion.  You should also contact [CONTACT_100307] a persistent cough, fever, chills, congestion, or any flu- like symptoms while receiving rituximab (or several months after 
discontinuation of rituximab therapy).  These symptoms may be signs of a serious infection.

Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [37] Note : Rituximab in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any adverse event 
currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events never 
previously associated with e ither agent.   
 
6.B.3 PHARMACOLOGY 
 Pharmacokinetics : In prior studies patients treated at the 375 mg/m2 dose levels exhibited 
detectable antibody concentrations throughout the treatment period. Most patients exhibited increasing 
pre-infusion antibody concentrations with each subsequent infusion. In nine patients, the T 1/[ADDRESS_110415] antibody infusion was 59.8 hours (11.1 – 104.6 hr) with a C max of 271 mcg/mL.  
 
 Formulation: Rituximab antibody will be provided on 100 mg (10mL) and 500 mg (50ml) 
pharmaceutical grade vials at a concentration of 10 mg of protein per mL (actual concentration should be noted on the product label). 
 
 Storage and Stability : Rituximab should be stored at 2 - 8°C. Do not freeze or store at room 
temperature. The product is a protein- HANDLE GENTLY AND AVOID FOAMING. The avoidance of 
foaming during product handling, preparation and administration is important, as foaming may lead to the denaturing of the product proteins. 
 
 Administration: Prepare the rituximab infusion solutio n as follows: 
1. If a delay in administration of the infusion occurs after the product is prepared, the properly identified container may be kept refrigerated at 2 - 8°C for up to six hours. 
2. Use sterile, non -pyrogenic, disposable containers, syringes, needles , stopcocks and 
transfer tubing, etc. 
3. Transfer of the rituximab from the glass vial should be made by [CONTACT_2329] a suitable sterile graduated syringe and large gauge needle.  
4. Transfer the appropriate amount of rituximab from the graduated syringe, into a partial ly filled IV pack containing sterile, pyrogen- free 0.9% sodium chloride 
solution, USP (saline solution). The final concentration of rituximab in saline solution should be a maximum of 1 mg/ml. Mix by [CONTACT_41223]. DO NOT USE A VACUUM APPARATUS to transfer the product from the syringe to the plastic bag. 
5. Place an IV administration set into the outflow port of the bag containing the infusion solution. 
6. NOTE:  DO NOT USE evacuated glass containers which require vented administration sets because this causes foaming as air bubbles pass through the solution. 
The administration of rituximab will be accomplished by [CONTACT_25726].  CAUTION:  DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  IV pumps such as the IMED 960 may be used with the rituximab  infusion.  DO NOT INFUSE CONCOMITANTLY with another IV solution or 
IV medications.  Prime the line with the rituximab solution such that approximately 30 mL are delivered.  This will saturate the filter and tubing.

 [38] 6.C Ibritumomab (IDEC -2B8) Drug Informa tion 
6.C.1 Origin of the Ibritumomab (IDEC -2B8) Cell Line  
The murine anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody 2B8.H11.G3.G9, ibritumomab (IDEC -2B8), is an 
IgG 1 kappa antibody.  The selection of the monoclonal antibody ibritumomab was based upon 
observations that: ibritumomab specifically recognized and bound to human B -cell lines and normal 
human peripheral blood lymphocytes in the same relative proportion as the highly characterized and 
commercially available anti -CD20 antibodies anti -Leu16 and B1; anti -Leu16 and B1 were effectively 
inhibited by [CONTACT_100308]; ibritumomab exhibited no cross -
reactivity with T -lymphocyte populations.  
Ibritumomab was previously expressed by a murine hybridoma cell line and produced in hollow -
fiber bio reactors.  Currently, ibritumomab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in 
suspension culture.  The CHO -expressed ibritumomab antibody differs from the murine hybridoma 
product in that one amino acid (at position 238 in the heavy chain) has been changed from a lysine to a 
methionine.  The CHO Master Cell Bank has been fully characterized and found to be negative for mycoplasma, infectious virus, and replicating viruses.  Types A and C retroviral particles were observed by [CONTACT_46106].

or Grade 2 in 3% (12 patients).  Six patients (2.0%) had Grade [ADDRESS_110420] 
infection, bacterial or viral pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, perihilar infiltrate, pericarditis, and intravenous drug -associated viral hepatitis.  Three patients (1.0%) had Grade  4 infections comprising 
bacterial pneumonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], and sepsis. 
Secondary Malignancies :  A total of 1.7% of patients (6/349) developed secondary malignancies 
following treatment with ZEVALIN.  One (0.3%) patient developed a Grade 1 meningioma, and 
5 (1.4%) developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [42] NOTE:  Past -marketing experiences of erythema multiforme, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], bullous dermatitis, and exfoliative dermatitis were report ed in patients who 
received received the Zevalin® therapeutic regimen, which includes Rituximab, In- 111 Zevalin® and 
Y-90 Zevalin®. Some of these events were fatal.  The onset of the reactions was variable: in some 
cases acute, days in others, and delayed (3 -4 months).  Biogen Idec has, therefore, revised the 
BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections of the Prescribing 
Information for Zevalin® to describe severe cutaneous or mucocutaneous reactions in patients receiving Zevalin®.  Patients experiencing a severe cutaneous or mucocutaneous reaction should not receive any further components of the Zevalin® therapeutic regimen and should seek prompt medical evaluation.

 [45] d. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors  may be given at the discretion of the 
treating physician to prevent or mitigate unacceptable granulocytopenia associated 
with fever, or granulocytopenia less than 500 granulocytes/µl.  The use of G -CSF 
must be documented on the treatment summary form.  Any toxicities associated with G -CSF must also be documented on the adverse event form. 
 
8 TOXICITIES TO BE MONITORED AND DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS  
 
This study will utilize the CTC (NCI Common  Toxicity Criteria) Version 3.0 for toxicity and Adverse 
Event reporting.  A copy of the CTC Version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov).  All appropriate treatmen t areas should have access to a copy of the 
CTC Version 3.0. 
 
8.A   ESHAP  Toxicities & Dose Modification 
In the case of multiple toxicities, dose modifications should be based on the most severe dose -limiting 
toxicity.  
 
8.A.1 Hematologic Toxicity:  
The ES HAP regimen should be given as described in Section 7.A if the granulocytes are > 1,500 
cells/µL and the platelets are > 100,000 cells/ µL by [CONTACT_100313].  If the blood 
counts have not recovered, treatment should be delayed by [CONTACT_100314].  If, after [ADDRESS_110426] not yet 
recovered, the patient should be treated at 75% of the last dose received of etoposide and cytarabine.   
 
8.A.2 Grade 3 or 4 Infection:  
(NCI  Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0) due to chemotherapy -related neutropenia requires a 
decrease in the doses of etoposide and cytarabine to 75% of the last dose received.  Re -escalation 
is at the discretion of the treating physician.  In this study, fil grastim or peg -filgrastim may be 
administered to prevent neutropenia at the discretion of the treating physician.    
 
The use of filgrastim or peg -filgrastim must be documented on the treatment flow sheets.  Any 
toxicities associated with either of these a gents must also be documented on the treatment flow 
sheets.  
8.A.3 Impaired Renal Function:  
All patients with serum creatinine levels < 1.3 or creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 60 mL/min will 
receive full doses of all drugs.  If the creatinine is 1.4 – 2.0 or  the CrCl is 30 – 60 mL/min then 
the doses of cytarabine, etoposide, and cisplatin should all be reduced by 50%.   A creatinine clearance of < 30 mL/min will require holding all treatment.    Re -escalation to full dose is at the 
discretion of the treating physician if the serum creatinine level drops to < 1.3 or the CrCl > 50 
mL/min.

 8.A.4 Neuropathy :  
Patients experiencing Grade 3 cisplatin neuropathy (e.g., loss of motor function) will have the 
dose reduced by 50% for all further cycles of ESHAP.  Patients experiencing Grade  [ADDRESS_110427] the dose reduced by 50% for cycle 2.  Patients experiencing Grade [ADDRESS_110428] the cytarabine omitted 
from all further cycles.  
 
8.B Rituximab Antibody  Toxicities & Dose Modifications  
 
8.B.1 Fevers : 
Patients may experience transient fever and rigors with infusion of chimeric anti -CD20 
antibody.  If Grade 3 fever (or Grade 2 fever with rigors) or Grade [ADDRESS_110429] available local practices and procedures.  Following observation, when fever resolves to 
Grade 2 or less and rigors to Grade 1 or less, the infusion should be continued, initially, at 1/2 the previous rate.  Following the antibody infusion, the IV line should be kept open for medications, as needed.  
 
8.B.2 Hypersensitivity : 
Hypotension, bronchospasm or angioedema have occurred as part of an infusion- related 
symptom complex.  If a Grade 3 or greater hypersensitivity/allergic reaction occurs, rituximab infusi on should be interrupted and may be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate when symptoms 
have completely resolved.  Treatment with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen is recommended; additional treatment with bronchodilators or IV saline may be used at the physi cian's discretion.  Precautionary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_100248].

resolved to Grade 2 or less. If treatment is delayed for more than 3 weeks, call the Study Coordinator. 
 
8.B.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome: 
Appropriate medical therapy should be provided for  patients who develop tumor lysis 
syndrome.  Following treatment for and resolution of tumor lysis syndrome, subsequent 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [47] rituximab therapy may be administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for this

8.B.5 Hepatitis B Reactivation with Related Fulminant Hepatitis and Other Viral Infections: 
Carriers of hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active  HBV infection and for signs of hepatitis throughout their study participation.  Patients with any  evidence of active hepatic di sease or known HBV infection should be managed as clinically  
appropriate and should only receive rituximab if they have control of the infection and are  adequately informed of the risks.  Patients who have never received vaccination for HBV, and  have not had serologic testing for HBsAg, should be tested for surface antigen positivity.  In patients who develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), rituximab should be  discontinued and reductions or discontinuation of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy and  appropriate treatment, including antiviral therapy , should be considered.  Physicians should  
consider PML in any patients presenting with new onset ne urologic manifestations, particularly  
in patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SL E) or ly mphoid malignancies.  Consultation  
with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture should be considered as clinically indicated.   There are no known interventions that can reliably prevent PML or adequately treat PML if it  occurs .  
 
8.B.6 Severe mucocutaneous reactions :   
All patients on or off rituximab therapy should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms  suggestive of severe cutaneous and mucocutaneous reactions.  Should these symptoms arise,  discontinue rituximab therapy (if applicable) and support as clinically indicated.   
8.B.7 Cardiovascular events :   
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk for cardiovascular events compared  with the general population.  Patients with RA should be monitored through the infusion, and  rituximab should be discontinued in the event of a serious or life- threatening event.  
 
8.B.8: Arrhythmias : 
Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of rituxim ab.  Patients with pre -existing cardiac conditions 
including arrhythmias and angina have had recurrences of these events during rituximab therapy and should be monitored throughout the infusion and immediate post -infusion period.  Patients 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [48] off rituximab th erapy should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of life -
threatening cardiac events and supported as clinically indicated.   
 
8.B.9 Bowel Obstructions and Perforation:   
Complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in the course, should prompt a thorough  
diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.  If the patients experiences a bowel obstruction  or perforation, discontinue rituximab therapy.  Patients off rituximab therapy should be closely  monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of bowel obstruction and supported as clinically  indicated.   
 
8.B.10 Renal :  
Discontinuation of rituximab should be considered for those patients with rising serum creatinine  or oliguria.  
8.C   
111In Zevalin & 90Y Zevalin Toxicities & Dose Modifica tions  
 
The ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) regimen may cause severe and potentially fatal infusion reactions 
that usually occur with the first rituximab infusion.  Signs and symptoms may include hypotension, 
angioedema, hypoxia or bronchospasm, and may require interruption of rituximab , 111In Zevalin  or 
90Y Zevalin  administration.  The infusion may be restarted at the physician's discretion. 
During the administration of treatment, emergency support for anaphylaxis is to be readily available, including a try for epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, a laryngoscope, and an endotracheal tube.   
 8.C.1 Use of Colony Stimulating Factors (CSF) and Platelet and Red Blood Cell Transfusions :   
 Colony Stimulating Factors (CSF) should be administered only in accordance with published   ASCO guidelines. Use of CSF under these conditions will be at the discretion of the treating  
 investigator, but must be recorded on the flow sheets.  
  Platelet transfusions should be administered only in patients with Grade [ADDRESS_110431]. Persky  at (520) 626- 
 8908.   
Unexpected or fatal toxicities (including suspected reactions) must be reported to the Study  Coordinator, the ACC DSMB, the IRB, Biogen Idec, and the FDA. The procedure for reporting  adverse r eactions is outlined in Section 9.  
 
9 ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENT REPORTING  
 
Throughout the course of the study, every effort should be made to remain alert to possible adverse 
experiences.  Adverse events should be recorded using the toxicity criteria of the NCI Clinical 
Cooperative Groups and the Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program(Appendix C) .  Adverse events not 
listed in toxicity criteria should be rated as either mild, moderate, severe, maximal/life threatening as 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [49] Grades 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.  In the event of an adverse experience, appropriate medical intervention 
should be provided and if necessary, the investigational agent (Zevalin) should be discontinued. 
All adverse events regardless of the relationship to the study drug(s) whether observed by [CONTACT_64836], will be recorded with details of the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to test drug and the patient outcome, on an appropriate source document at the clinical site. The investigator will evaluate each adverse experience as to its relationship to the test drug and as to whether or not it was serious. 
All abnormal laboratory results will be appraised by [CONTACT_100316].  For any 
laboratory abnormality considered clinically significant, details should be recorded on an appropriate source document including the action taken with respect to the test drug and the patient outcome. 
Adverse events occurring after the initiation of other anti -cancer therapy will n ot be followed, unless the 
therapy is initiated and the adverse event occurs within 30 days following the Zevalin drug infusion.  
9.A Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Principal Investigator, ACC DSMB, the IRB and, 
if necessary, the FDA  
Any serious or unexpected  adverse event (including death) due to any cause whether or not related to the 
study drug(s) must be immediately reported to the principal investigator, ACC DSMB, the IRB and drug 
manufacturer .  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_100249] c omplete the SAE form and arrange to have 
it faxed in a timely manner to the Drug Safety and Risk Management Department of Biogen Idec 
Incorporated ([PHONE_723]).  See Appendix  E for SAE form . 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator -Sponsor to IMMEDI ATELY REPORT  ALL SERIOUS OR 
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE IMMEDIATELY TO THE IRB CHAIR (AS PER INSTITUTION 
POLICY) AND, IF APPROPRIATE, TO THE FDA BY [CONTACT_100317] A MEDWATCH FORM (FDA FORM 3500A) .  The Investigator -Sponsor must promptly provide a copy 
of the MedWatch form to Biogen Idec at the same time it is submitted to the FDA.  Completed FDA 
3500A reports should be faxed to the Drug Safety and Risk Management Department of Biogen 
Idec Incorporated (877 -462- 1532).  See Appendix E for additional  informat ion and a blank copy of 
the MedWatch form.  
Serious adverse events occurring after initiation of other anti -cancer therapy do not need to be reported, 
unless the therapy is initiated and the event occurs within [ADDRESS_110432] this medication discontinued when 
the platelet counts fall below 30,000 cells/mm3.  Oral anticoagulant therapy may be resumed upon signs 
of platelet recovery, at the discretion of the invest igator.

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.A Study Design 
This is a two - institution phase II trial to determine the efficacy and safety of the ESHAP -Zevalin 
combination therapy for the management of relapsed (CD 20+) follicular lymphoma.  Patients must have 
received at least one, but no more than 2 prior treatments for follicular lymphoma.    
 
The primary objective of this phase II clinical trial is to evaluate the 1 -year progression -free survival 
(PFS) of patients with relapsed follicular NHL treated with ESHAP chemotherapy for cytoreduction (2 
cycles) followed by Y -90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) radioimmunotherapy, compared to what would 
be expected historically for patients treated with Zevalin without prior cytoreduction.  For this patient population, a 1- year PFS of 67.3% will be considered highly encouraging, compared to an historical rate 
around 50%.  These values correspond to approximate median times to progres sion of 21 months and 12 
months, respectively, assuming exponential survival.  
 
12.B.  Sample Size 
The planned sample size of 52 evaluable patients is based on testing the null hypothesis that the true 1-
year PFS is ≤50%, versus an alternative hypothesis that the true rate is ≥67.3% with this therapeutic approach.  Based on the number of patients seen at the Arizona Cancer Center with relapsed follicular lymphoma requiring treatment, the anticipated accrual rate is [ADDRESS_110433] for one binomial population at the 
one-sided 0.10 significance level.  If t he true PFS is ≤50%, then there is a maximum probability of 0.10 
of concluding that this treatment approach is sufficiently promising that it should be accepted for further 
study (false positive rate).  Alternatively, if the true PFS is ≥67.3%, then the ma ximum probability of 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [51] rejecting this treatment approach for further study in this setting is 0.10 (false negative rate), equivalent 
to a power of 90%.  At the end of the trial, the observed PFS and response rates will be reported, along with appropriate confidence limits.  Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to estimate the survival curve of time -to-
progression.    Promising results at the conclusion of this trial will justify further study in a larger trial.  
 
[ADDRESS_110434] (IRB) 
The investigator will supply all necessary documents to be submitted to the IRB and will ensure that the institution has a properly structured research committee.  The University of Arizona Human Subjects  Protection Program will be  the IRB  of record.  Documentation of initial and 
ongoing reviews, submission of serious adverse event reports, study amendments and revisions, and consent form modifications will be required .  This documentation is to be forwarded to :

• Informed consent – 100% of cases enrolled;  
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [53] • Subject eligibility - 50% of cases, up to two subjects ; 
• Data review - 50% of cases , up to two subjects . 
 
All subsequent monitoring  visits will consist of randomly selected subject cases based on current 
enrollment and include continuing review of previously selected cases, as applicable.  
 A monitoring visit report and follow -up letter w ill be completed within two weeks of the routine 
monitoring visit; a copy will be maintained in the study file. A query/finding form will also be 
completed by [CONTACT_89032], clarification, information or corrections  to the CRF and/or regulatory records. The Clinical Research Coordinator or other 
applicable staff responsible for the study will be given a copy of this form for resolution of queries/findings. The query/finding form will be maintained with a copy of the visit report for follow-up at the next monitoring visit.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89018], completeness, legibility and timeliness of the data reported in the Case Report Form (CRF). Source documentation supporting the CRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the trial and should document the dates and details 
of study procedures, adverse events, and patient status.  
 
Case report forms, which include the inclusion/exclusion criteria form , adverse event forms and 
serious adverse event forms [other forms, depending on study] should be completed with a black ball-point pen or typed. Corrections to the forms should not obscure the original entry and should 
be made by [CONTACT_89033] a single line. Each strike should be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_89034]. All subject forms and study files will be stored in a secure area limited to authorized staff . 
 
Note:  Routine monitoring of regulatory documents and test article will be  conducted at least 
annually.  
 
4. Process to implement study closure when significant risks or benefits are  identified:  
This study may be prematurely terminated, if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_100250].   Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients 
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate 
• Insufficient complete and/or evaluable data 
   
5. Description of adverse events and reporting procedures:  
  
ADVERSE EVENTS   
 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or  clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a casual relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [54]  
Any and all adver se events will be recorded on the UMC adverse events record form and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_079]. 
 
All adverse events will be classified using either the MedDRA term or NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0  and will address: 
• Grade 
• Relationship to study drug(not related, unlikely, possible, probable, definitely)  
• Causality other than study drug (disease related, concomitant medication related, intercurrent 
illness, other)   
• Date of onset, date of resolution 
• Frequency of event (single, intermittent, continuous) 
• Event outcome (resolved, ongoing, death) 
• Action taken (none, held, dose reduced, discontinued, medication given) 
  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that  at  any dose:  
 1) Results in death;   2) Is life -threatening;  
 3) Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89019];   4) Results in disability persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or: 
 5) Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect.  
 
Note : A SAE may also be an important medical event, in the view of the investigator that 
requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
All serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, and a ny deaths will be reported within 24 
hours of notification of the event to the sponsor and DSMB Coordinator. All serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, and any deaths will be reported within 5 days of notification of the event to the University of Arizona Human Subjects Protection  Program.  
  
All serious adverse  events will be processed by [CONTACT_100320], every six months. The DSMB coordinator will review the SAE reporting process to confirm reporting requirements are met.  
 
6. Plan for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance:  
Routine study activity and safety information will be reported to the DSMB every six months, or more frequently if requested. These reports will include:  
• Study activity, cumulative and for the period under review; 
• Safety (narrative description on non-serious and serious adverse events); 
• Predetermined protocol early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89020]/futility;    
• Monitoring and protocol compliance; 
• Comments;  
• Attachments (AE data reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_89021], SAE letters and reports, results of any review(s), applicable correspondence with the IRB or other regulatory agencies.  
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [55]  
 Data, safety and study progress will be reported to: 
• Human Subjects Protection Program (IRB) at least annually;  
• Sponsor (if applicable) at least every six months. 
 
7. Identification of the sponsor or funding agency, as applicable: 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_89022]; in writing, the funding agency, if applicable, any action 
 resul ting in a temporary or permanent suspension of the study.

ADULT TOXICITY CRITERIA 
COMMON TOXICITY CRITERIA (CTC)  
 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 
(CTCAE)  
Publish Date: August 9, 2006 
Quick Reference 
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  v3.0 is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for  Adverse 
Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity) scale is  provided for each AE term.  
Components and Organization  
CATEGORY  
A CATEGORY is a broad classification of AEs based on anatomy and/or pathophysiology. Within each CATEGORY,  AEs are listed 
accompanied by [CONTACT_100327]  (Grade).  
Adverse Event Terms 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  
associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical  treatment or 
procedure. An AE is a term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical  documentation and scientific 
analyses. Each AE term is  mapped to a MedDRA term and code. AEs are listed alphabetically within CATEGORIES.  
Short AE Name  
[CONTACT_100359] ‘S HORT NAME’ column is new and it is used to simplify  documentation of AE names on Case Report Forms.  
Supra -ordinate Terms  
A supra- ordinate term is located within a CATEGORY and is a groupi[INVESTIGATOR_100257], signs, symptoms,  or 
diagnosis. A supra- ordinate term is followed by [CONTACT_100328] ‘Select’ and is accompanied by [CONTACT_100329]- ordinate term. Supra- ordinate terms  provide clustering and consistent representation of Grade for  related AEs. Supra-
ordinate terms are not AEs, are not  mapped to a MedDRA term and code, cannot be graded and cannot be used for reporting.  
REMARK  
A ‘R EMARK ’ is a clarification of an AE.  
ALSO CONSIDER  
An ‘A LSO CONSIDER ’ indicates additional AEs that are to be graded if they are clinically significant.  
NAVIGATION NOTE 
A ‘N AVIGATION NOTE’ indicates the location of an AE term  within the CTCAE document. It lists signs/symptoms  alphabetically and 
the CTCAE term will appear in the same CATEGORY unless the ‘N AVIGATION NOTE’ states differently.  
Grades 
Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinic al descriptions  of severity for 
each AE based on this general guideline:  
Grade 1 Mild AE  
Grade 2 Moderate AE  
Grade 3 Severe AE  
Grade 4 Life- threatening or disabling AE  
Grade 5 Death related to AE  
A Semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the gr ade. 
An ‘Em dash’ ( —) indicates a grade not available.  
Not all Grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five options for Grade selection.  
Grade 5 
Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not  an option.  
The DEATH CATEGORY is new. Only one Supra- ordinate term is listed in this CATEGORY: ‘Death not associated with CTCAE 
term – Select ’ with 4 AE options: Death NOS;  Disease progression NOS; Multi -organ failure; Sudden death.  
Important:  
•  Grade 5 is the only appropriate Grade 
•  This AE is to be used in the situation where a death 
1. cannot be reported using a CTCAE v3.0 term associated with Grade 5, or 
2. cannot be reported within a CTCAE  CATEGORY as ‘Other (Specify)’

reporting.

 [66] APPENDIX D 
INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP STANDARDIZED RESPONSE CRITERIA FOR NON-
HODGKIN’S LYMPHOMAS  
 
1. RESPONSE CLASSIFICATIONS  
The definition of “complete disappearance” of clinically detectable disease varies.  Patients 
considered disease- free have been defined by [CONTACT_100330] (CBC), 
clinical and radiologic findings, and sizes of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver.  Additionally, the 
lack of bone marrow involvement may be required.  Some investigators have set a minimal 
duration for the absence or reduction of disease before the response is confirmed[1-11].  In some, 
responses are reclassified retrospectively.   
Because of the considerable variation in the literature, specific, standardized guidelines for 
response assessment were recently established in a 1998 report from an International Workshop conducted at the NCI.  Recommendations were pr esented to ensure accurate and objective 
evaluation of the presence or lack of disease, and comparability among clinical trials.  The recommended criteria were based on lymph node biopsy and bone marrow evaluation and considered as anatomic definitions.  C ategories were included for CR, CR/unconfirmed (CRu), 
PR, and relapse/progression 
[12].  Flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular studies were not 
included in response definitions ( Table 1).

progression  Enlarging 
liver/spleen;

Adapted from Cheson et al., 1999[12] 
In addition, definitions were recommended for end points of interest in clinical trials, including survival (overall, event -free, progression -free, and disease- free), as well as response duration, 
time to next treatment, and cause -specific death (Table 2 ).

Adapted from Cheson et al., 1999[12] 
 
2. MEASURES OF DURATION 
• Time to Progression:  measured from the date of first study treatment to the first date when progressive disease is documented. 
a. Progressive Disease (PD) -Free Interval (Duration Of Response):  measured, in a 
responder, from the date when a CR, CCR or PR is first noted to the first date at which progressive disease is observed.  An ongoing PD -free interval occurs when 
there is a responder for whom progressive disease has not been noted. 
3. MEASURABLE LESIONS  
• Measurable lesions will be assessed bidimensionally  at baseline for determining the efficacy 
of study treatment.  Measurable lesions must be measured at baseline by [CONTACT_100331].  The patient must have at least 
one lesion of 2 cm or larger in its longer diameter.  
4. DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE 
b. The extent of disease is measurable if the patient has one or more lesions that are clearly demarcated and  may be represented with clearly defined margins as 
measured in centimeters.  These measurements will be bidimensional (two longest perpendicular measures per lesion) meeting the minimum requirement:  1) at least  1.5 cm in a single dimension for all lesio ns and 2) at least 2.[ADDRESS_110444] be measured at baseline by [CONTACT_100332].  Each measurable lesion will be 
consistently measured bidimensionally for the duration of the study.  In addition, 
 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [68] the routine method of measurement for any measurable lesion, e.g., X -ray, CT 
scan, etc. will remain the same for each ev aluation throughout the course of the 
study.  Measurements will be performed using a ruler or calipers and will be 
recorded in centimeters.

 [80] APPENDIX G 
GUIDELINES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RADIONUCLIDE DOSE  
CALIBRATOR SETTINGS USING MDS NORDION YTTRIUM -[90] CHLORIDE  
 
#1.  DOSE CALIBRATOR SETUP FOR 90Y:  Please use the following two worksheets (pages 2 and 3), 
along with the manufacturer’s reference manual, to establish dose calibrator dial settings for assaying 90Y.  Dial 
settings for 90Y are established using MDS Nord ion 90Y as a standard.  MDS Nordion 90Y is accompanied by [CONTACT_100335] 1200h ET on the intended 
day of use.  The radioactivity concentration is determined by a liquid scintillatio n technique traceable to the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  This traceability has been established by [CONTACT_100336] 90Y sample and achieving agreement to within plus or 
minus 5%.   
#2.  GE OMETRY CHANGES:   You must establish a new dial setting when you change dispensing 
equipment.  This applies to a change in needle size, a change in syringe type, or a change in the reaction vial within the dose calibrator.  A change in the type of container and/or the orientation of the container within the dose calibrator is a change in geometry.  When using beta- emitting radionuclides a change in geometry will 
influence the dose calibrator reading.  
#3.  ACCURACY:   The accuracy of liquid transfer from the MDS Nordion 90Y vial using syringes 
commonly available in nuclear medicine departments is adequate, but not optimal.  Gravimetric or volumetric methods can enhance the accuracy of the transfer (Coursey et al, Nucl Med Biol 1993; 20:693-9).
 
#4.  USE OF WOR KSHEETS:   The worksheets on pages [ADDRESS_110448] be established for 10 mL of 90Y Zevalin in a Zevalin reaction 
vial, or the range of 90Y Zevalin volumes assayed in a 10 mL syringe.  Once the dial settings are established, keep 
these worksheets as a reference for future use.  An example of the range of dial settings used for a range of 90Y 
Zevalin volumes in a 10 mL syringe is provided on page 4.  
#5.  DAILY CALIBRATION CHECK:  On a daily basis, the dose calibrator response for each frequently 
used dial setting must be checked with a long -lived dose calibrator source.  Suggested isotopes are  
137Cs, 57Co, 60Co, or 133Ba.  Consult your health physicist.  
#6.  INITIAL IS OTOPE CALIBRATION NUMBER:   The radionuclide dose calibrator manufacturer 
must be contact[CONTACT_100337] 90Y.

(ZEVALIN REACTION VIAL)  
 
1. The Activity Concentration Sheet provided with each MDS Nordion 90Y vial 
includes data based on 1200h ET on the intended day of use.  Use the 90Y decay 
table on page 1 to determine the current MDS Nordion 90Y activity 
concentration, adjusting for time zone changes.  (Example:  At 1400h ET, 
[ADDRESS_110451]-calibration, the decay factor is 0.979.  If the Activity Concentration 
Sheet  reports 84.0 mCi/mL, the current activity concentration is 
84.0 mCi/mL  x 0.979 = 82.2 mCi/mL).   
_________mCi/mL  
2. Using the activity concentration determined in Step #1, calculate the volume for 40 mCi. (Example:  40 mCi ÷ 82.2 mCi/mL = 0.49 mL).  Draw up the appropriated volume for [ADDRESS_110452] the dial setting until the dose calibrator indicates 40 mCi (take into account any multiplier that may be 
required by [CONTACT_100338]).  Record as Dial Setting A.    
4. Transfer 40 mCi into a reaction vial.    
5. Wash residual activity from the 1 mL syringe into the reaction vial with normal  
saline.  (Two 0.[ADDRESS_110453] of the retained activity in the needle/syringe hub).  
_________mL  
6. Place the [ADDRESS_110454] the residual activity in th e 1 mL syringe determined in step #6 from 
40 mCi to determine the activity transferred into the reaction vial (Example:  40.0 mCi  - 0.2 mCi  = 39.8 mCi).   
_________mCi 
8. Add normal  saline to the reaction vial to a total volume of 10.0 mL.  (Note:  
10.0 mL mi nus volume transferred in step #2 and step #5 equals the volume to 
add).

data based on 1200h ET on the intended day of use.  Use the 90Y decay table on 
page 1 to determine the current mds nordion 90Y activity concentration, adjusting 
for time zone changes.  (example:at 1400h ET, [ADDRESS_110456]-calibration, the decay 
factor is 0.979.  If the activity concentration sheet  reports 84.0 mCi/mL, the 
current activity concentration is 84.0 mCi/mL x 0.979 = 82.2 mCi/mL).  
_________mCi/mL 
2.   Using t he activity concentration determined by [CONTACT_75849] #1, calculate the volume for 
40 mci.  (example: 40 mCi ÷ 82.2 mCi/mL = 0.49 ml).  Draw up the appropriate 
volume for [ADDRESS_110457] the dial setting until the dose calibrator indicates 40 mCi (take into account any multiplier that may be required by [CONTACT_100338]).  Record as dial setting a.   
4.   Transfer 40 mCi into a reaction vial.    
5.   Wash residual activity from the 1 mL syringe into the reaction vial with normal 
saline.  (two 0.[ADDRESS_110458] of the activity retained in 
the needle and syringe hub).  
_________mL 
6.   Place the [ADDRESS_110459] the residual activity in the 1 mL syringe de termined in step #6 from 40

INFORMATION FOR 111In Zevalin and 90Y Zevalin 
CAUTION:  New Drug -- Limit ed by [CONTACT_100339]:  
Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) is a murine monoclonal anti- CD20 antibody that will be 
radiolabeled with Indium-111 or Yttrium-90. 
 
Note: 111In Zevalin or 90Y Zevalin should not be administered until the patient has received 
the second Rituxan infusion.  
 I. Components of the Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) Kit and Preparation of 
111In 
Zevalin and 90Y Zevalin 
 
A. Radioisotopes:  111In  and 90Y used for preparing 111In Zevalin and 90Y Zevalin , will be 
obtained from vendors identified by [CONTACT_100340] .  All lots of isotopes must be sterile, 
pyrogen-free and be supplied in septum vials designed to maintain these conditions.  
 
B. Radiolabeling Kit Components :  For clinical studies, conjugated Zevalin ( ibritumomab 
tiuxetan) will be radiolabeled with either 111In for imaging or 90Y for therapy using a 
radiolabeling kit.  The radiolabeling kit is provided by [CONTACT_100341].  All kit components are tested for sterility and  pyrogenicity. 
 
The kit is stored at 2 - 8°C (35 - 45°F) and consists of the following components:  1) Three mL glass septum vial containing 2 mL (3.2 mg) Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) in low- metal normal saline at 1.6 mg/mL  
 2) Three mL glass septum vial  containing 2 mL low- metal 50 mM sodium acetate  
 3) Ten mL glass septum vial containing 10 mL formulation buffer (1X PBS containing 7.5% human serum albumin and 1 mM DTPA, pH 7.2) 
 4) Ten mL glass septum reaction vial (empty)  
 
C. See the appropriate Appendix for  corrected geometry of dose calibrator for Y -[90].  
 
D. Preparation of 111In Zevalin:   Proper aseptic technique and precautions for handling 
radioactive materials should be employed.  Waterproof gloves shall be utilized in the preparation and determination of the radiochemical purity assay of 
111In Zevalin.  The 
radiolabeling of 111In Zevalin shall be done according to the following directions using the 
radiolabeling kit described above. 
 
 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [85] 1) Before radiolabeling, bring refrigerated Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) cold kit to 
room temperature, 25° C (77 ° F). 
2) Clean the rubber stopper of all cold kit vials and the 111In chloride vial with a suitable 
alcohol swab and allow to air dry. 
3) Place the 111In Zevalin reaction vial in a suitable dispensing shield. 
4) Using a 1 mL syringe, transfer sodium acetate to the reaction vial.  The volume of 
sodium acetate added is equivalent to 1.2 times the volume of 111In chloride. 
5) With a 1 mL syringe, aseptically transfer 5.5 mCi of 111In chloride to the reaction vial.  
Mix completely by g ently swirling and inverting the reaction vial several times, do 
not shake. 
6) Using a 3 mL syringe, transfer 1.0 mL Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) to the reaction vial.  Mix completely by [CONTACT_100342].  Do not shake.  
7) Incubate the 
111In Zevalin reaction vial at room temperature for thirty minutes.  
Labeling more than or less than thirty minutes may result in inadequate radiochemical purity. 
8) Using a 10 mL syringe with a large bore needle (18 - 20 G), draw formulation buffer 
that will result in a total volume of 10 mL when all components are added to the reaction vial.  The initial volume in the reaction vial is the volumes calculated in Steps 4, 5, and 6.  Ten mL minus the volumes in 4, 5, and 6, will be the volum e of 
formulation buffer to add. 
9) At the end of the thirty -minute incubation period, add the formulation buffer to the 
reaction vial.  Gently add the formulation buffer down the side of the reaction vial.  Do not foam, shake or agitate the mixture. 
10) Assay the  
111In Zevalin reaction vial in a suitably calibrated dose calibrator.  
11) If not immediately administered to the patient, store the reaction vial containing the 
111In Zevalin at 2 ° to 8° C (26 ° to 46° F) and use within 12 hours. 
12) The percent radiochemical puri ty of the prepared 111In Zevalin should be determined 
before administration to the patient according to the procedure in Section II. 
13) DO NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED DOSE OF 5 mCi 111In Zevalin. 
 
E. Preparation of 90Y Zevalin :  Proper aseptic technique and precautions for handling 
radioactive materials should be employed.  Waterproof gloves shall be utilized in the preparation and determination of the radiochemical purity assay of 
90Y Zevalin.  The 
radiolabeling of 90Y Zevalin shall be done according to the following directions using the 
radiolabeling kit described above. 
 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [86]  
1) Before radiolabeling, bring refrigerated Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) cold kit to 
room temperature 25° C (77° F).   
2) Clean the rubber stopper of all cold kit vials and the 90Y chloride vial  with a suitable 
alcohol swab and allow to air dry. 
3) Place the 90Y Zevalin reaction vial in a suitable dispensing shield. 
4) Using a 1 mL syringe, transfer sodium acetate to the reaction vial.  The volume of sodium acetate added is equivalent to 1.2 times the volume of 
90Y chloride. 
5) With a 1 mL syringe, aseptically transfer 40 mCi of yttrium- [90] chloride to the 
reaction vial.  Mix completely by [CONTACT_100343], do not shake.  
6) Using a 3 mL syringe, transfer 1.3 mL Ze valin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) to the reaction 
vial.  Mix completely by [CONTACT_100342].  Do not shake .  
7) Incubate the 
90Y Zevalin reaction vial at room temperature for five -minutes.  Labeling 
more than or less than five minutes may result in inadequate radiochemical purity.  
8) Using a 10 mL syringe with a large bore needle (18 - 20 G), draw formulation buffer 
that will result in a total volume of 10 mL when all components are added to the 
reaction vial. The initial volume in the reaction vial is the volumes calculated in Steps  4, 5, and 6.  Ten mL minus the volumes in 4, 5, and 6, will be the volume of 
formulation buffer to add. 
9) At the end of the five -minute incubation period, add the formulation buffer to the 
reactio n vial.  Gently add the formulation buffer down the side of the reaction vial.  
Do not foam, shake, or agitate the mixture. 
10) Assay the 
90Y Zevalin reaction vial in a suitably calibrated dose calibrator.  
11) If not immediately administered to the patient, store  the reaction vial containing 90Y 
Zevalin at 2° to 8° C (36° to 46° F) and use within eight hours.

Zevalin and 90Y Zevalin. 
 
III. RECOMMENDED HANDLING AND ADMINISTRATION OF 111IN ZEVALIN 
AND 90Y ZEVALIN 
 1. Refer to the appropriate section of the clinical trial protocol for details about the dose and dose sc hedule.  Note: Patients will receive an imaging dose of [ADDRESS_110462] recent platelet counts from 100,000/mm3 to 149,000/mm3 will be treated 
with a 0.3 mCi/kg dose of 90Y Zevalin.  Patien ts with most recent platelet counts 
≥ 150,000/mm3 will be treated with 0.4 mCi/kg dose of  90Y Zevalin.   
 
2. Vials should be stored with proper shielding at 2 - 8°C (35 - 45°F).  Do not freeze or 
store at room temperature.  The drug is a protein -- HANDLE GENTLY AND AVOID 
FOAMING.  The avoidanc e of foaming during product handling, preparation and 
administration is important, as foaming may lead to the de -naturing of the product proteins. 
 
3. All transfer procedures require strict adherence to aseptic techniques, preferably in a laminar flow hood.  
4. 
111In Zevalin and 90Y Zevalin may be directly injected by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_100261].  A 0.[ADDRESS_110463] be on line between the syringe and the infusion port.    NOTE:  DO NOT USE evacuated glass containers that require vented administration sets 
because this causes foaming as air bubbles pass through the solution. 
 5. The administration of the radiolabeled drug will be accomplished by 10 minute IV injection and should be completed within the time specified in the protocol.  CAUTION:  DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS BOLUS.  Flush the line with at least [ADDRESS_110464] has been infused. 
 
NOTE:  IV pumps may be used with the 
111In Zevalin and 90Y Zevalin injection.  DO NOT 
INJECT CONCOMITANTLY with another IV solution or IV medications.

5.C  - Changed:  “Evaluations During the 111In Zevalin Imaging Period 
CAUTION WILL BE TAKEN IN THE HANDLING OF ALL RADIOACTIVE SAMPLES ACCORDING TO 
STANDARD PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES AT THE CLINICAL SITE. 
Vital signs will be obtained every [ADDRESS_110473] hour during the Rituxan infusion, hourly during the 
remainder of the infusion, and immediately following the 111In Zevalin infusion.  If vital signs are unstable, they will 
be monitored at 5- minute intervals until stable.  
The purpose of 111In Zevalin imaging is twofold:  
• To evaluate biodistribution of whole body gamma camera images  
• To assess whether biod istribution is acceptable to proceed with 
90Y Zevalin radioimmunotherapy.  
The biodistribution of 111In Zevalin should be assessed by a visual evaluation of whole body planar view anterior 
and posterior gamma images.  A set of images at 48- 72 hours after injection is required.  To resolve ambiguities, 
optional images at other time points may be necessary.  Images should be acquired using a large field of view gamma camera quipped with a medium energy collimator.  Whole body anterior/posterior planar images s hould be 
acquired using a large field- of-view gamma camera and medium energy collimators.  Suggested gamma camera 
settings: 256 x 1024 matrix; dual energy photopeaks set at 172 and 247 keV; 15% symmetric window; scan speed of 
10 cm/min for the 48 -72 hour scan, and 7- 10 cm/min for subsequent scans.

• Moderately low or very low uptake in normal kidneys, urinary bladder, and normal (uninvolved) bowel.  
• Non-fixed areas within the bowel lumen that change position with time; delayed imaging as described 
above may be necessary to confirm gastrointestinal clearance.  
Tumor uptake may be visualized in soft tissue as areas of increased intensity, and tumor -bearing areas in normal 
organs may be seen as areas of increased or decreased intensity.  Tumor visualization on the 111In Zevalin scan is 
not required for 90Y Zevalin therapy.  
b. Altered biodi stribution  
• Intense localization of radiotracer in the liver and spleen and bone marrow indicative of reticuloendothelial system uptake  
• Increased uptake in normal organs (not involved by [CONTACT_20150]) such as: 
• Diffuse uptake in normal lung more intense than the li ver. 
• Kidneys with greater intensity than the liver on the posterior view.  
• Fixed areas (unchanged with time) of uptake in the normal bowel greater than uptake in the liver.  
• In less than 0.5% of patients receiving 
111In Zevalin, prominent bone marrow uptake was observed, 
characterized by [CONTACT_100348].  
If a visual inspection of the gamma images reveals an altered biodistribution, the patient should not 
proceed to the 90Y Zevalin dose.  The safety and efficacy of the administration of 90Y Zevalin in patients 
with prominent marrow uptake is not known.  Possible causes of prominent bone marrow uptake, such as bone marrow involvement by [CONTACT_56927], increased marrow activity due to recent hematopoietic growth factor administration, and increased reticuloendothelial uptake in patients with HAMA and HACA, should be considered.

 6.B.1 DESCRIPTION  
 Rituximab is a mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody consisting of human IgG1 heavy and kappa 
light chain constant regions with murine variable regions from the murine  IgG1 kappa anti -human CD20 
monoclonal antibody rutuximab. The rituximab antibody is produced by a Chinese hamster ovary transfectoma.  
 6.B.2 TOXICOLOGY  
 Human Toxicology: Single doses of up to 500 mg/m2 and weekly x 4 doses of 375 mg/m2 have been 
administ ered without dose limiting toxicity. Adverse events are most common during the intitial antibody infusion 
and usually consist of Grade 1, or 2 fever (73%), asthenia (16%), chills (38%), nausea (19%), vomiting (11%), rash 
(14%), and t umor site pain (3%). Grade 1 or 2 hypotension (8%) may be treated with IV fluids. Hematologic toxicity is usually mild and reversible. Transient decreases in the WBC or platelet count have been observed – 
especially in patients with high levels of circulating tumor cells or bon e marrow involvement. Two patients have had 
late-onset Grade 4 neutropenia at four and ten months that was attributed to an unknown cause, were transient and 
resolved. Infections (Grade 1 and 2) have not been related to dose level. Symptoms are generally associated with the initial antibody infusions and diminish in frequency with each successive infusion.  
 Infusion Reaction: An infusion- related symptom complex consisting of fever and chills/rigors has occurred 
in the majority of patients during the first r ituximab infusion. Other frequent infusion- related symptoms include 
nausea, uticaria, fatigue, headache, pruritis, bronchospasm, dyspnea, sensation of tongue or throat swelling (angioedema), rhinitis, vomiting, hypotension, flushing, and pain at disease si tes. These reactions generally 
occurred within [ADDRESS_110482] infusion, and resolved with slowing or interruption of the rituximab infusion and with supportive care (IV saline, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen).

 6.B.3 PHARMACOLOGY  
 Pharmacokinetics : In prior studies patients treated at the 375 mg/m2 dose levels exhibited detectable 
antibody concentrations throughout the treatment period. Most patients exhibited increasing pre -infusion antibody 
concentrations with each subsequent infusion. In nine patients, the T 1/[ADDRESS_110484] antibody infusion was 59.8 
hours (11.1 – 104.6 hr) with a C max of 271 mcg/mL.  
 Formulation:  Rituximab antibody will be provided on 100 mg (10mL) and 500 mg (50ml) pharmaceutical 
grade vials at a concentration of 10 mg of protein per mL (actual concentration should be noted on the product label).  
 Storage and Stability : Rituximab should be stored at 2 - 8°C. Do not freeze or store at room temperature. 
The product is a protein- HANDLE GENTLY AND AVOID FOAMING. The avoidance of foaming during pr oduct 
handling, preparation and administration is important, as foaming may lead to the denaturing of the product proteins.  
 Admministration : Prepare the rituximab infusion solution as follows:  
7. If a delay in administration of the infusion occurs after the product is prepared, the properly 
identified container may be kept refrigerated at 2 - 8°C for up to six hours.  
8. Use sterile, non -pyrogenic, disposable containers, syringes, needles, stopcocks and transfer 
tubing, etc.  
9. Transfer of the rituximab from the glass vial should be made by [CONTACT_2329] a suitable sterile graduated syringe and large gauge needle.  
10. Transfer the appropriate amount of rituximab from the graduated syringe, into a partially filled IV pack containing sterile, pyrogen- free 0.9% sodium chloride solution, USP (saline 
solution). The final concentration of rituximab in saline solution should be a maximum of 1 mg/ml. Mix by [CONTACT_41223]. DO NOT USE A VACUUM APPARATUS to transfer the product from the syringe to the plastic bag.  
11. Place an IV administration set into the outflow port of the bag containing the infusion solution.  
12. NOTE:  DO NOT USE evacuated glass containers which require vented administration sets 
because this causes foaming as air bubbles pass through the solution.  
The administratio n of rituximab will be accomplished by [CONTACT_25726].  CAUTION:  DO NOT ADMINISTER 
AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  IV pumps such as the IMED 960 may be used with the rituximab 
infusion.  DO NOT INFUSE CONCOMITANTLY with another IV solution or IV medic ations.  Prime the line 
with the rituximab solution such that approximately 30 mL are delivered.  This will saturate the filter and tubing. ”

This research study is an investigator -sponsored trial.   The Arizona Cancer Center has an NCI -approved Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan for clinical research.  Data and systems for participating in the study will be monitored according to procedures outlined in that plan, with centralized patient screening and registration, submission and review of data, and initial verification of data as summarized below.  
DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN  
The Arizona Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will provide general oversight for this trial 
to ensure patient safety, data integrity and protocol compliance.  The Study Coordinator (based in the Southwest Oncology Group and the Lymphoma Programs) will coordinate data review and report preparation for this review.   
 
 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [109] Reports detailing clinical trial study status, serious adverse events, clinical outcomes (toxicities, responses), and audit findings from both sites will be submitted on at least a quarterly basis.   Serious adverse events from both sites will also be reported to the DSMB on a weekly basis.   The University of Arizona IRB will receive immediate notification of study serious adverse event s and study progress reports at the time interval specified at initial review.  
 Procedures for centralized registration of patients on this study are detailed in Section 13B.   All subjects registered to this study will be entered into the Arizona Cancer Center CRIS database for accrual and treatment status tracking.  Adverse events will also be tracked.  Patients from the University of [COMPANY_002]ster will be assigned a unique number to preserve anonymity.   In addition, a registration log will be maintained at both sites using Excel to keep 
track of study number, verification of consent, date of consent.  
 Case report forms, which include the registration form, the inclusion/exclusion criteria form, tumor measurement forms, response and survival assessment forms,  adverse event forms, and serious adverse event forms should be 
completed with a black ball -point pen or typed. Corrections to the forms should not obscure the original entry and 
should be made by [CONTACT_89033] a single line. Each strike should be accompanied by [CONTACT_100353]. All subject forms and study files will be stored in a secure area limited to authorized staff.  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_100269], compl eteness, legibility and timeliness of the data 
reported in these forms. Source documentation supporting the Case Report Form (CRF) data should indicate the subject’s participation in the trial and should document the dates and details of study procedures, adverse events, and patient status.   Data and systems auditing will be performed at each of the two sites to ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements.  Audits will be performed every 6 months at t he Arizona 
Cancer Center and annually at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster by [CONTACT_100354].  An audit report will be completed within 2 weeks of the review and a copy will be maintained in the study file.  A visit follow -up letter (if required) detailing outstanding data and/or issues to be addressed by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_100270] [ADDRESS_110490] specific corrections to the case report 
forms and/or request clarification or additional source documentation. The study coordinator responsible for the study will be given a copy of this form for resolution of findi ngs. The monitor form will be maintained with a copy of 
the visit report for follow -up at the next monitoring visit.  
 Once the study forms have undergone initial review with source documentation, data may be entered into the CRIS database by [CONTACT_9137].  All computer -based subject data are password- protected. It is designed to track 
data changes so that unintentional deletions in data are not made. The Arizona Cancer Center Quality Assurance 
 
 
 
Amendment # 9: 08/28/2017 
 [110] and Quality Control (QA/QC) Group will be responsible for monitoring the data entered in the database every 8- 12 
weeks or every 4th patient depending on frequency of enrollment.  
 Auditing will be carried out by [CONTACT_100355]/QC Group to comply with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The audits will include a review of subject informed consent; consistency between data points and source documents, adherence to protocol, accuracy of toxicity and response assessments, completeness and timeliness of serious adverse event reporting and general data quality.  Although the primary endpoints in this study relate to progression- free survival and time to progression, determination of overall and complete response rates 
with this treatment is a secondary endpoint and confirmatory review of responses will be  required.  
 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
 An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. An AE is a term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analyses. Any and all adverse events will be recorded by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_100271]..  
 A serious adverse event is any adverse event regardless of causality and: 1) results in death, 2) is life- threatening, 
3) requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89019], 4) results in disability, 5) is an 
important medical event, in the view of the investigator, that requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. All serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, and any deaths will be reported immediately to the Principal Investigator/ Study Coordinator at 520- 626-6786 and to the local IRB within 
5 days of notification of the event.  Serious adverse events will be reported on the SAE form.  Serious adverse events will also be reported to Biogen Idec, Inc, as specified in Section 9 of this protocol.  
 All adverse events will be classified using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 and will address:  
 
-grade  
-relationship to study agent or causality/attribution (not related, unlikely, possible,  probable, definitely)  
-date of onset, date of resolution 
-frequency of event (single, intermittent, continuous)  
-event outcome (resolved, ongoing, death)  
-action taken (none, medication, other)

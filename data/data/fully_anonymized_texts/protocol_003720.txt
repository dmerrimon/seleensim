Some of the people who are eligible to take part in this research study may not be able to give consent 
because they are less than 18 years of  age (a minor). Instead we will ask their parent(s)/guardian(s) to 
give permission for their participation in the study, and we may ask them to agree (give assent) to take 
part. Throughout the consent form, “you” always refers to the person who takes part in the research 
study.  
 
1. Why is this research study being  done?  
 
We are asking you to be in this research because you meet the preliminary criteria for participation in this 
study.  
 
The purpose of this research is to test how children respond to different meals over 3 five day periods.  
 
2. What will happen in this research  study?  
 
If you agree to take part in this research, you will be provided breakfast, lunch, dinner and two snacks 
(afternoon and evening) over 3 periods of 5 consecutive days (Monday – Friday). There will be 3 study 
weeks (5 consecutive days), with a minimum [ADDRESS_693211] during the child’s regularly scheduled meal periods in a pre-school 
classroom at your childcare center. Meals served will be similar to those served by [CONTACT_7416]-school (see 
attached fo od list). These meals and snacks meet the USDA and Child and Adult Care Food Program 
(CACFP) recommendations for calorie and nutrient content for pre-school a ged children. Trained research 
staff will observe these meals. Evening snack will be packed out for the child to take home along with an 
STUDY00001832  
Approval: 4/18/2019  
Approval End Date: 4/17/[ADDRESS_693212] week.  
 
In the event of unexpected events (i.e. unscheduled child care center closure, inclement weather, etc.), 
researchers may decide that a meal, or meals, may be packed out for consumption outside of the child care 
center and be returned to study staff the following day. If this should occur, you will be notified in advance. 
Applicable instructions for serving/reheating will be provided.  
 
Physical activity levels will also be measure over the 3 periods of 5 consecutive days using accelerometers. 
The accelerometers will be worn while the children are presen t at the daycare center (from before breakfast to 
after dinner). Research staff will attach a device to the child’s waist upon arrival at the center each morning 
and remove the device upon the child’s departure from the center each evening.  
 
At the end of the study, children will meet with a research assistant for a brief interview that includes The 
Tasting  Game,  which  will involve  assessing  the child’s  preference  of the foods  used in the study  and reasons 
they stop eating at a lunchtime meal. Your child’s height and weight will also be measured once during the 
study by a trained lab staff member. We may take a photograph of the children during a test session to be 
used in poster  or slide presentations  of this study  at scientific  meetings.  If you do not wish to be included  in a 
photograph,  there  is a place  for you to indicate  such at the end of this consent  form.  
 
Parents will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires (4 total), a background questionnaire and behavioral 
questionnaires. Questionnaires will be distributed toward the end of the study. You are free to skip any 
questions you do not wish to answer. Payment information will be obtained during the last week of study 
participation, as well.  
 
Teachers wi ll also be asked to complete a questionnaire in which they will be answering questions about 
children enrolled in the study. There is a place for you to indicate whether or not questions about your child 
may be answered by [CONTACT_533832].  
 
3. What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research  study?  
 
There are no risks involved in eating the meals. The foods served will be commonly  
served items at the day care center. It is possible that investigators will discove r a participant's previously 
unknown food allergy during the course of the study. If this occurs, the parent(s) of the child will be 
notified immediately so that a quick decision about medical care can be made and action can be taken.  
 
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if your information or your identity is obtained by [CONTACT_461905], but precautions will be taken to prevent this from happening.  
 
4. What are the possible benefits from being in this research  study? 
4a. What are the possible benefits to you?  
 
There are no direct benefits for participating in this research.  
 
 
4b. What are the possible benefits to others?  
 
You will be aiding in our understanding of human eating behavior.

5. What  other  options  are available  instead  of being  in this research  study?  
 
You may decide to not participate in this study.  
 
6. How long will you take part in this research  study?  
 
The total time you will spend participating in this project, including meals, the game, and height and weight 
measurements, will be roughly 37.5 hours (30 minutes for each meal and 15 minutes for obtaining height and 
weight and the tasting game). The duration of the study will be 5 consecutive days, and you will be 
completing three of these 5 day periods for a total of 15 days.  
 
The total time for parents will be roughly 30 minutes to complete the questionnaires. 
Total time of child and parent participation will be approximately 39 hours.

study?

 Synopsis  
Study  title: Targeted Interventions to Prevent Chronic Low Back Pain in High Risk Patients: A 
Multi -Site Pragmatic RCT (TARGET Trial)  
Objectives:   
Low back pain ( LBP) is one of the most prevalent and potentially disabling conditions for which 
people seek health care. Patients, providers , and payers are in agreement that greater effort 
needs to be directed toward prevention of the transition from acute to chronic LBP. Chronic LBP 
is painful, disabling and expensive (from a patient’s perspective), extremely difficult to manage 
(from a provider’s perspective), fraught with inefficiencies including unnecessary exposure to 
expensive tests and risky procedures (from a payer’s perspective), and may contribut e to opi [INVESTIGATOR_693783] (from society’s perspective). With the majority of patients who experience acute LBP seeking care from their primary care physician (PCP), this study will 
compare common, pragmatic, evidence- based,  and patient -centered appr oaches emanating 
from the PCP environment to reduce the proportion of people with acute LBP who transition to 
chronic LBP  and improve functional abilities . 
The research question to be addressed with the present study is:  
For patients with acute LBP deemed  high risk to transition  to chronic LBP, does 
prompt referral to psychologically informed physical therapy (PI[CONTACT_6214]) reduce the rate of 
transition  to chronic LBP  and improve functional abilities?  
To answer this question, we will compare:  
1. A Guideline- Based Car e (GBC) arm (comparator arm ) in which management decisions 
are made between PCPs and patients with the guidance of best evidence but with no 
specific directives ; and  
2. A Guideline- Based Care plus Psychologically Informed Physical Therapy (GBC+PI[CONTACT_6214]) 
arm (intervention arm) in which PCP care is enhanced with a prompt referral to physical 
therapy (PT) that includes psychologically informed coaching  directed towards education 
and reduced fear of movement.  
Specific aims : 
Primary Aims :  For patients with acute LBP deemed high risk to transition to chronic LBP, 
determine the effect of prompt referral to PI[INVESTIGATOR_693784] (1) preventing transition to chronic LBP and (2) 
improving functional abilities.  
Secondary Aims : (1) Measure use of medical resources for treatment of LBP for those patients 
categorized as high risk at presentation; and (2) Describe rates of transition from acute to 
chronic LBP, functional ability, and use of medical resources for patients categorized as low or  
medium risk at presentation to their PCP.  
Hypotheses: The combined GBC +PI[INVESTIGATOR_693785] (1) preventing patients with acute LBP from 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_693786], (2) improving functional outcomes, and (3) reducing medical res ource 
utilization for the treatment of LBP.  
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   2 
 Design and outcomes :  
The primary randomized controlled trial (RCT) cohort  study is a multi -site cluster RCT 
comparing GBC  versus  GBC +PI[INVESTIGATOR_693787] , as determined by [CONTACT_693887]. A secondary, prospective, 
observational cohort study will be conducted for those patients presenting with acute LBP who 
are at low or medium risk for chronic LBP as measured with the STarT Back Tool.  
The STarT  Back Tool is a 9- item, validated questionnaire for use in the PCP setting to screen 
patients with acute LBP for prognostic indicators of transition to chronic LBP. The tool groups 
patients into low, medium, and high risk categories. Though the tool was developed and tested with European samples, there is emerging evidence to support its use in the US. Recruitment 
will include a minimum of 12 PCP clinics within each of five geographical areas (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA; 
[LOCATION_011], MA; Baltimore, MD; Charleston, SC; Salt Lake City, UT). Each PCP clinic will b e cluster 
randomized to one of two arms of the trial.  
The primary outcome measures of the study are the presence or absence of chronic LBP  and 
functional ability, determined by [CONTACT_693888] (Oswestry), at 6 
months in the high risk group.  A secondary outcome measure is medical resource utilization  
related to LBP  (e.g., imaging, epi[INVESTIGATOR_158419], prescribed medications, surgery) 
determined through electronic medical record (EMR)  data.  
Interventions and duration:  
This research study is built upon a quality improvement (QI) initiative that includes 1) collection 
of patient -reported outcomes in all primary care settings and 2) prompt referral to PI[INVESTIGATOR_693788] s with high risk acute LBP in the intervention settings.  All PCPs part of the initiative will 
receive a primer on current evidence- based clinical care guidelines for the treatment of acute 
LBP.  All PCP practices will receive QI instruction on how to collect data for the Chronic  LBP 
Questionnaire, the Oswestry  LBP Questionnaire,  and the STarT Back Tool, which will be given 
to clinicians and PCPs through the EMR . Clinicians in the intervention settings will also receive 
QI instruction and EMR tools to refer patients with high risk  acute LBP to a PT practice where 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693789] . Patients in the GBC comparator arm will 
receive care from their PCP based on best evidence but with no specific directives or prompts for referrals. R ecruiting for par ticipation in  the research study  will occur at each o f the five sites 
for 15- 26 months.  
Sample size and population:  
Plans are to enroll 1,[ADDRESS_941152] of 
6,900 low and medium risk patients. Both groups will be followed for 12 months.

 1 Study objectives  
The target population for this study is adult patients who present t o PCPs ( i.e., internal 
medicine, family practice , and geriatric medicine physicians) to receive care for back pain 
during the prim ary care clinic visit.  To distinguish “acute” versus “chronic” LBP,  a 2-
question screen based on criteria developed by [CONTACT_693889]: 1) How long has low back pain interfered with your ability to do 
regul ar daily activities?  2) Think only about the past 6 months.  How often has low back 
pain interfered with your ability to do regular daily activities? A response of “more  than 
three months ” to question 1, and a response of “ half the days or more than half t he days ” to 
question [ADDRESS_941153] medical contraindications to PT (“red flags” ) 
based on the judgement of the PCP as documented in the E MR. 
1.1 Primary objective  
The primary aim s (PA1  and PA2 ) of this pragmatic clustered RCT  and the primary 
hypotheses (H1  and H2) are:  
1.1.1  PA1: In patients with acute LBP who are deemed “high risk” for transition to 
chronic  (RCT cohort) , two study arm treatments wi ll be compared, 1) GBC  and 
2) GBC+PI[CONTACT_6214] , and the proportion of this cohort  that transition to chronic LBP at 
the 6 -month assessment . 
1.1.2  H1: GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693790].  
1.1.3  PA2: Compare between the two study arms LBP- related function (e.g., lifting, 
walking, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ) for high risk patients using the Oswestry at 6 months.  
1.1.4  H2: GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693791].  
1.2 Secondary objectives  
Secondary aims (SA) and relevant hypotheses are:  
1.2.1  SA3: Compare between the two study arms acute LBP -related medical  
resource  utilization  (e.g., imaging, epi[INVESTIGATOR_158419], opi [INVESTIGATOR_2438]) for high 
risk patient s. 
1.2.2  H3: GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693792] -related 
medical resource utilization for patients with high risk acute LBP . 
1.2.3  SA4: Follow patients with acute LBP who are deem ed “low and medium  risk” in 
an observational cohort to determ ine the proportion that transitions to chronic 
LBP at 6 months , assess  functional  outcomes  at 6 months , and measure LBP-
related medical resource utilization  at 12 months .  
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   4 
 1.2.4  SA5: Conduct s ubgroup analyses for PA1- 2 and SA3 -4 on patients with lower 
socioeconomic status (using Medicaid or no insurance as a proxy) and the co -
morbid conditions of smoking, depression, and obesity . 
1.2.5  H5: GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693793] l ower  transition to chronic LBP and will be more 
effective than GBC alone for improving functional outcomes  and reducing LBP -
related medical  resource  utilization for  the subgroup of  patients  with depression 
or low socioeconomic status . Because the interventions being studied do not 
specifically target obesity  and smoking , and the influence of smoking and 
obesity on the progression of acute to chronic LBP is uncertain,  group x obesity  
or smoking  interactions  are not expected .

 2 Background  
2.1 Background on acute LBP  
2.1.1  LBP is highly prevalent . Low back pain (LBP) is the most common type of 
pain and the second most common reason for doctor visits in the United 
States .[ADDRESS_941154] frequent LBP2 and 
nearly 2.5 million Americans are disabled by [CONTACT_682979], 1.2 million permanently.3 Up 
to 80% of U nited States  adults will experience at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_693794]4,5 and appr oximately 25% report experiencing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_693795].6 Chronic LBP affects a n estimated 5- 10% of U nited 
States  adults .7 
2.1.2  Acute LBP frequently transitions to chronic LBP.  The pr ognosis of acute 
LBP is generally considered good , with a prevailing view that spontaneous 
recovery occurs within six weeks.8 However, epi[INVESTIGATOR_693796] 60% to 75% of patients improve with in one 
month ,9 and at three months , 27% are completely better, 28% improved, 30% 
have no change,  and 14% are worse or much worse.10 Additionally, 
recurrences are common (up to 54% in first 6 months) and 19% of patients can still be symptomatic at [ADDRESS_941155], 
and feelings of resentment and dejection in friends or family members .13 Over 
50% of adults with chronic LBP report difficulties with basic functions such as 
movement or cognition, and 55% report difficulties with complex actions such 
as self -care or work activities .[ADDRESS_941156] costs for L BP care in the US are more than $[ADDRESS_941157] 
costs for chronic LBP (predominantly change in work productivity in most 
populations)[ADDRESS_941158] costs.17-22 Back 
pain patients incur up to 75% more medical expenditures t han patients without 
back pain.23,[ADDRESS_941159] expensive cause of workers’

increased five- fold.29,30 In 2010, opi[INVESTIGATOR_693799], responsible for 16,651 deaths.31 
2.1.6  Health disparities are associated with LBP . LBP  disproportionatel y impacts 
racial and ethnic minorities.7,32,33 Medical expenditures for LBP in minorities are 
30% lower than for whites.[ADDRESS_941161] comprehensive s ystematic review of practice 
guidelines to date, issued in 2007 by [CONTACT_693890], found there were 
insufficient data to support any specific approach to prevent the transition from acute to chronic LBP.
38 An exhaustive review of the literature published after 
11/1/2006 (search terms clinical trials, back pain, chronic, acute, prospective, prognosis) was conducted that yielded [ADDRESS_941162]  the transition from acute  to chronic pain 
and/or follow  patients t hrough the transition. However, no definitive prospective 
clinical trials were identified comparing different patient -oriented interventions 
with sufficient long -term follow -up to determine effectiveness for the prevention 
of the transition from acute to c hronic LBP.  
2.2.2  The rate of transition from acute to chronic LBP is not well characterized.  
The societal burden of chronic LBP, which is attributed to a small minority of patients with LBP, is well supported.
39 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_693800], there is little discr ete information about 
chronic LBP and its relationship to acute LBP,26 including more precise data 
concerning the rate of transition from acute to chronic. Estimated rates of transiti on vary widely from 5 -33%.
8-11,40 European studies41 of a stratified 
approach similar to our proposed intervention demonstrated improvement in patient -centered outcomes, such as back pain- related function ( e.g., 
improvements in walking, climbing stairs, carrying groceries, sexual function), 
pain intensity, patient satisfaction, sleep, and mood. Reduced patient exposure 
to expensive and possibly risky tests and procedures was also found. However,

minima lly influenced by [CONTACT_693891].46 
2.2.5  Primary care LBP clinical guidelines do not always align with psychosocial factors related to LBP.  All LBP guidelines promote early 
activation (e.g., encouragement to quickly return to normal activities). Yet some 
patients overtly avoid physical activity during an epi[INVESTIGATOR_693801] (“fear avoidance”) , a disproportionately 
pessimistic outlook (“catastrophizing”) , and depression.

2.2.6  Deficiency of LBP g uideline implementation in PT care.  Guideline 
adherence in PT environments  remains at a persistently low level and variation 
is poorly understood ,51-55 despi[INVESTIGATOR_693802].56 Of particular 
relevance to the proposed study is the emerging evidence in PT that supports  
the use of psychologically informed physical therapy  for patients with 
psychosocial characteristics associat ed with transition to chronic LBP. 
Combined therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693803], who can be identified via a brief screening procedure, are recommended in current PT guidelines.

TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   [ADDRESS_941166]: 1) a physical exam , 2) a diagnosis and explanation of the cause of their 
pain,  3) information and instructions on self -care, and 4) pain relief . Patients 
also expect health care providers to confirm that their pain is real, listen to and 
respect their views  and treatment preferences , and include them in decision 
making. Patients can become impatient with “wait and see” approaches, w hich 
are common in guideline recommendations, and will instead request more 
biomedical explanations for their symptoms.[ADDRESS_941167] 61% of Penns ylvania Medicare cases received an MRI for 
nonspecific LBP  even though there were no indicators for the procedure,  as 
specified by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines for LBP.
[ADDRESS_941168] less to do with PCP knowledge gaps 
and be more related to time constraints. Stakeholder engagement discussions with PCPs, confirmed by [CONTACT_80669],
62 identify time constraints common to 
PCP practice in the US as the major barrier in addressing patient concerns. Given the prevalence of LBP in primary care  settings , the cumulative time for 
communication and education - specifically inquiring about patients' 
expectations, providing  opportunit ies to correct misperceptions, explaining  the 
natural history of LBP and the rationale for test and treatment decisions - 
quickly becomes overburdening in a busy PCP clinic.  A quote heard in more 
than one PCP stakeholder engagement session was, “It’s far easier to just 
order the MRI and prescribe medications.” Our own patient stakeholders 
uniformly comment that they also are frustrated by [CONTACT_693892], especially when it is above and beyond multiple other 
chronic issues, such as diabetes and hypertension, that all need to be 
addressed in a 15 -minute visit. Patients also expressed dissatisfaction with a 
medication- only approach. A common s entiment of our patients was , “All the 
doctor wants to do is prescribe drugs.”  
2.3 Study rationale  
This study will assess whether the  stratified approach using PI[INVESTIGATOR_693804]  1) is effec tive in the US; 2) has the 
potential to prevent patients from transitioning to chronic LBP; and 3) reduces patient 
exposure to unnecessary, expensive, and potentially harmful tests (e.g., MRIs), 
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   9 
 medications (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), and procedures (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_158419]). The 
research will provide guidance to patients, primary care providers, clinics, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693805], insurers, payers, and professional organizations responsible for clinical 
practice guidelines and dissemination regarding  the following health decision: Should 
prompt referral to evidence- based psychologically informed physical therapy  be 
strongly recommended for high risk patients presenting with acute LBP? 
2.3.1  Pragmatic clinical trial design: T his study is focused on whether  the stratified 
approach with PI[INVESTIGATOR_693806] a primary care  clinical setting. 
Consequently, based on the work of Thorpe et al64 and Loudon et al ,63 the 
study intentionally incorporates the  Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator 
Summary tool, version 2 (PRECIS -2), nine domains to achieve a pragmatic 
approach.  The nine domains are eligibility  criteria , recruitment, setting, 
organization, delivery, adherence, follow -up, primary outcome, and primary 
analysis.  These domains will be referenced in the remainder of the document 
as specifics of the design, interventions, and analysis are presented.  
2.3.2  Subjects are patients  with acute LBP  that present at primary care 
practices : Subjects for this study will be adult patients who present to PCPs  
(i.e., internal medicine, family practice , and geriatric medicine physicians) to 
receive care for back pain during a primary care clinic visit.  Testing this  
approach in primary care environments was chosen because many patients in 
the US  prefer accessing their PCP for the majority of their health problems, 
including LBP . This setting is consistent with the PRECIS -2 pragmatic setting 
domain.  Subjects  will then be identified as acute or chronic using  a modified 
version of the chronic LBP definition recently created by [CONTACT_693893].42  
2.3.3  Acute LBP interventions based on a stratified approach:  After identification 
as an acute LBP patient, the STarT Back Tool will be administered , and the 
resulting scores will stratify patients as low, medium, or high risk  for transition 
to chro nic LBP . Patients identified as high risk are  patients who would likely 
benefit from increased education and attention due to greater perceived pain, 
poor physical functioning, maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_610] (catastrophizing, fear 
avoidance), and comorbid depression and anxiety.65 PCPs can then efficiently 
target interventions for  these patients.  
This stratified approach to treating LBP in the primary care environment is largely based on compelling effectiveness data from European investigators.
41 
Foster’s study in [LOCATION_006] family practices used the STarT Back  Tool to stratify acute 
LBP p atients into 3 risk categories: high, medium, low.[ADDRESS_941169] of potential constructs and chose the final ones. 
Patient acceptability of the tool was also assessed using a sample of back pain 
patients consulting primary care. Patients need 2- 3 minutes to answer the 9 
patient -centered, yes/no questions. Those patients determined by [CONTACT_693894] (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   [ADDRESS_941170] comparing GBC and GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693807]: This 
pragmatic RCT will have two study arms for treating patients identified as high 
risk f or transitioning to chronic LBP : 1) GBC  arm in which management 
decisio ns are made between PCPs and patients with the guidance of best 
evidence but with no specific directives , and 2) GBC+ PI[INVESTIGATOR_693808] a 
standardized regime of PI[INVESTIGATOR_693809]. By [CONTACT_693895]+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693810], patients and their PCPs will be 
better able to judge the potential effectiveness of prompt referral to PI[INVESTIGATOR_693811]. 
Based on stakeholder feedback, an RCT design was chosen because its 
results will be more compelling and definitive, more generalizable with a greater degree of certainty that c ould lead to changes in provider behavior and 
payers’ benefit design. This study’s primary outcome (PRECIS -2 domain)  of 
rate of transition from acute LBP to chronic LBP for high risk patients receiving 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_693812]. Furthermore,  it 
will provide PCPs with specific techniques for caring for these patients.  
2.3.5  Rationale for GBC comparator arm : Based on guidance from Thompson and 
Schoenf eld,
66 a comparator arm  (GBC  in this case) is justified because: 1) the 
research question is to compare an evidence- based “strategy” against 
guideline- informed care and 2) both approaches are considered pr udent and 
good care for the target population. The “strategy” ( GBC+PI[CONTACT_6214] ) is an approach 
designed to match patients with LBP stratified to high risk  to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_693813], 
which has been shown to be effective.41,49,[ADDRESS_941171] available through the EMR information about the patients’ chronic versus acute status, functional 
limitations (Oswestry), and risk level (STarT Back). However, a PT referral will 
not be automatically generated and the PCP  will have the freedom to treat high 
risk patients accord ing to their individual clinical judgment.   
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   11 
 Furthermore, there ar e pragmatic reasons to include the GBC  arm. Primary 
care for low back pain is highly variable with little evidence thus far of  adequate 
translation of evidence- based practice (EBP) guidelines  to routine clinical care. 
Until recently, most approaches to EBP  uptake in primary care have relied 
solely on passive diffusion (e.g., “publish it and they will come”) approaches. 
With health care reform and increasing emphasis on quality, however, there 
are other factors that may accelerate clinicians’ adoption of EBP approaches. 
At the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589] (UPMC), Intermountain 
Health care, and [LOCATION_011] Medical Center, shared savings programs and other 
system -wide quality initiatives  have been implemented, all of which may result 
in better uptake of best care standards. P rovider stakeholders  interviewed all  
agreed that LBP represents an area of concern within their systems and predicted that it will be a target of such initiatives. Given t hese probable 
initiatives within the study  sites, it is essential to have a comparator arm  to the 
study as an accurate comparator of real -life primary care for LBP. In addition, a 
number of the  primary care stakeholders  interviewed do not routinely refer t o 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. However, they are willing to go along with the 
randomization assignment and will comply with either arm of the trial. Although 
some degree of crossover is anticipated (i.e., patients assigned to GBC  will be 
referred to PT), it is hig hly likely to be less than patients from GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693814]. 
Moreover, this crossover will be tracked through the EMR .  
2.3.6  Rationale for GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693815]:  When familiarized with the studies 
from Europe on the STarT Back  approach, stakeholders and investigato rs were 
intrigued with its sensibility and, most importantly, its positive results with 
regard to outcomes , such as less pain, improved back function, and reduced 
exposure to tests and measures. T he probability of transitioning to chronic LBP  
relative to GBC will be measured, which  was not measured by [CONTACT_693896]. Though all interviewed  stakeholders agreed and understood the lac k of 
generalizability to the US  health care system, all were confident  that the 
approach could be easily replicated  in the  US with some caveats. Although PT 
is a covered benefit common to virtually all US  payers, the size, scope, and 
cost of US  PT benefits are often distinctly different than in Europe (i.e., less 
care with greater co- payments). These concerns were quickly brought forth for 
discussion by [CONTACT_693897] -served populations.  
2.3.7  Quality improvement initiatives: This study is dependent on the 
implementation of two QI initiatives. First, all sites and PCP clinics involv ed in 
this study will implement tools ( e.g., patient portal s, tablet  computers , EMR 
upgrades) for the collection of patient -reported outcomes. They will also put in 
place QI training programs for staff and clinicians to learn how to collect 
patient -reported outcomes into the EMR. Finally , they will create monitoring 
reports that track performance of the PCP clinics in capturing patient -reported 
outcomes. Second, all intervention sites will implement tools (e.g., EMR 
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   12 
 notifications, order sets, electronic orders, letters) to alert clinicians and PCPs 
of patients with high risk acute LBP . They will also conduct QI training 
programs on when and how to refer patients to PI[CONTACT_6214]. Monitoring reports for 
referral to PI[INVESTIGATOR_693816].  
2.3.[ADDRESS_941172] eligibility : This study will us e broad inclusion 
criteria (age 18 or older, primary  complaint of back pain) and limited exclusion 
criteria ( “red flag” signs  and symptoms  of medical contraindications to physi cal 
therapy based on the judgement of the PCP  as documented in the EMR ). The 
study will exclude patients less than [ADDRESS_941173] their care managed by  [CONTACT_153997] , and LBP in adolescents is typi[INVESTIGATOR_693817]. Selection of the exclusion criteria was 
determined based on concerns for patient safety. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_693818] -2 domain of el igibility , it will: 1) have no 
upper age limit ; 2) inclu de women who are pregnant ; and 3) include people 
with non- severe compressive nerve root signs, all of which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_693819].  
2.3.9  Rationale for patient -reported outcomes : This study will also measure 
patient -reported outcomes with the Oswestry questionnaire. Since 1994, there 
has been a growing recognition in the treatment of back pain that patient 
perspectives are essential in judging the results of treatment. In fac t, many 
experts argue that  improving the patient's "quality of life" is often the main goal 
of therapy. Consequently, research in LBP has shifted dramatically from 
physiologic outcomes (e.g., range of motion, muscle strength, neurologic 
deficits) to rigoro us measurement of patient -reported outcomes such as pain, 
functional status, medication use, role function, quality of life, satisfaction with 
treatment , and work status . In many cases, functional outcomes can be 
measured with a high level of reproducibili ty. Because symptoms and 
functional outcomes are sometimes only loosely associated with physiologic 
phenomena in LBP research, the functional outcomes should be measured 
directly. Modern questionnaires for measuring patient quality of life combine the 
expertise of social scientists, clinicians , and patients to result in excellent 
reliability and validity.  
Through qual itative interviews with patients with LBP who were familiar with 
PT, several accepted LBP -specific instruments designed to measure health-
related quality of life were reviewed. Patients were asked for candid judgments 
of whether the items on the outcome instruments adequately represented what 
was important to them. Surprisingly, some items were uniformly rejected by [CONTACT_493200], such as numeri c pain ratings and global ratings of change, both of 
which are considered essential and widely accepted in the LBP literature. 
Instead,  questionnaires that dealt with functional ability (e.g., Oswestry ) were 
uniformly endorsed, with patients confirming the relevance of the items to their 
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   13 
 problem and even going as far to say the instrument helped them to articulate 
how their problem was affecting their everyday life. Consequently, patients also 
stated that any study that demonstrated improvement in the items  listed on 
outcome assessment forms , such as the Oswestry , would be relevant to them.  
2.3.10  Non-reliance on clinician expertise: Other than providing updates to existing 
guidelines through standard continuing education courses, this study does not 
require addit ional expertise on the part of PCPs or physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693820]. In both study arms, high risk patients will be identified in the EMR at the 
PCP office. In the GBC  arm, the high risk patients will be identified for the 
PCPs, and the PCP will be gi ven the freedom to treat the patient according to 
their individual clinical judgment . Matched interventions (advice to stay active, 
cognitive behavioral approaches, education, etc.) will be recommended through 
the EMR . In the  intervention GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693821] t he study , high risk patients will 
be identified and PI [INVESTIGATOR_693822] . To keep the trial pragmatic, the 
treatments will be made available with an explanation of potential benefits to 
patients in their respective study arms as well as referrals when applicable. 
There will be no undue pressure to comply with the treatments in either  arm of 
the study.  This is consistent with the PRECIS -2 domain of flexibility  (delivery).

physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693824] 8 hours, far less than the licensure 
requirements in the states participating, and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693825]. Continuing education will be focused on reviewing 
the principles of PI[INVESTIGATOR_693826].  
2.3.11  Potential risks : Due to the highly pragmatic nature of this study, the risks of 
either of thes e interventions are minimal. All aspects of patient care are within 
normal clinical practice and under the control of clinic -based practitioners. Any 
risks would be subject to the PCP or PT sites’ normal patient safety procedures.

The randomization for each study site  will be conducted by [CONTACT_693899]: Total Back Pain Encounters (Factor 1) and % 
Medicaid/Self -Pay (Factor 2).  First, the clinics will be ordered by [CONTACT_693900] 1 and divided 
into subgroups (blocks) . Clinics in each block w ill then be further ordered by [CONTACT_693900] 2, 
and randomly assigned to either group A or group B, making sure that the two groups 
would be balanced in terms of both Factor [ADDRESS_941176] primary outcome of the study  (PA1)  is the presence or absence 
of chronic LBP . This is determined through the patients’ answers to a two-
item Chronic LBP Q uestionnaire based on criteria developed by [CONTACT_693901].42 The questions are: 1) How long 
has low back pain interfered with your ability to do regular daily activities ? 2) 
Think only about the past 6 months.  How often has low back pain interfered 
with your ability to do regular daily activities?  Chronic LBP is defined as a 
response of “more  than three months ” to question 1, and a response of “half 
the days  or more than half the days”  in the past 6 months to question 2.   
3.3.2  The second primary  outcome  of the study  (PA2 ) is the Osw estry 
Disability Index.68 Originally described by [CONTACT_693902],68 the O swestry  LBP 
Questionnaire  is a reliable, well -validated, easily -administered, disease -specific 
measure that results in an index of a patient’s perceived level of function due to LBP a nd is based on ten areas of performance . Items include how the back 
pain impacts the patient’s ability to care for themselves (washing, dressing, 
etc.), lift, walk, sit, stand, and sleep. It also assesses the effect of the pain on 
the patient’s sex life (i f applicable), social life, and ability to travel. P atient

scored from 0 -  5 with zero representing no limitation and five representing 
maximal limitation. The ten areas , which include an assessment of pain 
intensity,  are added together, resulting in a maximum score of 50. This score is 
doubled and interpreted as a percentage of patient -perceived disability, with 
higher scores representing g reater disability.  
3.3.3  A secondary outcome (SA 3-5) is LBP-related medical resource utilization , 
including 1) referrals to specialists (e.g., orthopedists, spi[INVESTIGATOR_693831], 
physiatrists) and other health care providers, 2) tests (e.g., MRIs), surgical 
procedures (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_158419], laminectomy), and 3) prescription 
analgesi cs including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
3.4 Study population and sites  
The target population for this study will be adult patients who present  to primary care 
physicians (i.e., internal m edicine, family practice , and geriatric medicine physicians) 
with a primary complaint of LBP. Patients will be recruited from health systems in five 
regional areas that surround: 1) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] , PA (UPMC) ; 2) [LOCATION_011], MA  ([LOCATION_011] 
Medical Center) ; 3) Baltimore, MD  (Johns Hopkins Medicine) ; 4) Charleston, SC  
(Medical University of South Carolina) ; and 5) Salt Lake City, UT (Intermountain 
Healthcare) . Within the individual regional areas, primary care clinics have been 
identified that represent community -based PCP clinics. In all instances, there are more 
potential sites than are required for successf ul completion of the trial, which will allow 
flexibility in the randomization scheme and alternatives should there be individual 
PCP-clinic recruitment shortfalls. This large, nation- wide group of clinics across five 
different health systems provides a hig h level of pragmatism for the PRECIS -[ADDRESS_941178] (SA5) given greater risk for  poorer 
LBP outcomes as demonstrated in observational cohort studies. A dequate enrollment 
will be assured to have statistical power to conduct subgroup analyses of patients with

 4 Selection and enrollment of participants  
4.1 Inclusion criteria  
Inclusion criteria for the study are:  
1) 18 years of age or older , and 
2) Receiving care for  acute low back pain (i.e., does not meet the criteria for 
chronic  LBP)  during a primary care clinic visit . 
An even distribution of age from 20- 60 years of age is expected with a slight drop off 
after age 60, due to LBP becoming more of a chronic problem with aging. The lower 
age limit on recruitment of 18 years was included based on stakeholder feedback from 
internal medicine and family medicine colleagues that pointed out the dif ferent nature 
of LBP in adolescents. Gender is expected to be 50% male and race /ethnicity will 
closely match those in the geographical location of the sites. English language 
proficiency will not be an inclusion criteri on because it is assumed that clinics  with a 
significant non- English population will have translation capabilities for that population.  
4.2 Exclusion c riteria  
Exclusion criteria are limited to medical contraindications to physical therapy based on 
the judgem ent of the PCP  as documented in the EM R (i.e.,  “red flag” signs and 
symptoms  of a potentially serious condition such as cauda equina syndrome, major or 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_608850], cancer, spi[INVESTIGATOR_693832]).72 
4.3 Study  enrollment procedures   
4.3.1  Subjects will be enrolled  at all of the PCP clinics selected for the trial. In 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_693833], all patients will be admitted into 
the trial who present with a complaint of acute back pain.  Recruitment 
(PRECIS -2 domain) is highly pragmatic being solely based on patients 
presenting to the clinic with back pain.  
4.3.2  Randomization: The study is a cluster RCT ; randomization of treatment arm 
assignment is at the clinic level, not the individual patient.  Enrollment will be t he 
same for both arms of the study.  
4.3.3  Screening procedures: Using patient portals, clinic -based tablets, or manual 
questionnaires, administrative staff or clinicians at the PCP sites  will administer 
a baseline assessment  with three  components that will be i ncluded in the 
patients’ EMR . At all sites, the EMR will be  modified to accept these data 
elements : 
1) The 2 -item Chronic LBP Questionnaire  (Appendix 1) ,42 
2) The 9 -item STarT Back Tool to stratify risk for transition to chronic LBP 
and identify high risk patients  (Appendix 2) ,41 
3) The 10-item Oswestry LBP Questionnaire (Appendix 3).  
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   18 
 4.3.4  Ineligibility and non- participation: Patients with chronic LBP will be 
documented as not eligible and will not be enrolled fo r interve ntion or 
subsequent assessments . Patients ref using to complete the baseline 
assessments  will be documented as refusing screening and not included in the 
enrollment for intervention or subsequent  assessments .

5.1 Interventions, administration, and duration  
5.1.1  Referral to PI[CONTACT_6214] : As a result of the QI initiative, all patients in the intervention 
arm identified as high risk will be referred to PI[CONTACT_6214] . PCPs will have the results of 
the screening questionnaires in the EMR  to identify the high risk acute LBP 
patients  and refer them to PI[CONTACT_6214].  PCPs will provide patient education materials 
as appropriate, including materials  about musculoskeletal injury, PT, and pain 
management . Referrals will occur through automatic electronic referral, manual 
electronic referral, written prescription, fax, or verbal means.  
5.1.2  Delivery of PI[CONTACT_6214] : Upon referral to PI [CONTACT_6214], trained physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693838].  The number of PT sessions

TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   [ADDRESS_941181] received the prescribed 
physical therapy (i.e., a completed checklist, number of PT sessions).  
5.1.3  Patient -centered PI[INVESTIGATOR_693840] i nstructions: Community discussions with 
patients emphasized the desire to have a home exercise program in place after 
physical therapy that is feasible, effective, and sustainable. As an adjunct to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_693841], physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693842] a list of recommended community -
based exercise classes and resources appropriate for the patient.  
5.1.4  Patient -reported outcomes: At [ADDRESS_941182] 
departure from the pragmatic approach  (PRECIS -2 follow -up domain) ; 
however, stakeholders indicated that [ADDRESS_941183] ice for the PCP clinics.  These  assessments will be for  the 
Chronic LBP Questionnaire and Oswestry . 
5.2 Handling of study i nterventions  
5.2.1  PCP clinic  instruction: As part of the QI initiative, all PCP clinic sites will 
receive instruction on how to identify and c ollect patient -reported outcomes for 
patients with back pain. QI staff will work with physician champi[INVESTIGATOR_693843] . They will also receive an educational presenta tion, including a 
primer on guidelines for LBP, an overview of the Chronic LBP Questionnaire, 
the STarT Back  Tool, and the Oswestry. Sites included in the GBC  arm will not 
be instructed to alter their normal clinical procedures beyond data collection 
while  those in the intervention arm will be coached by [CONTACT_693904][CONTACT_6214].  
5.2.[ADDRESS_941184]  education: To educate physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693844], a PT continuing education program  will 
be provided for physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_693845], principles of 
PI[CONTACT_6214] , clinical application, and adherence. Initial training of physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] s 
will consist of a 1 -day (8 -hour) course that offers:  
1) A condensed and focused summary of the principles of pain 
neuroscience and cogni tive behavioral therapy (CBT),  
2) Case examples of using PI[INVESTIGATOR_693846],  
3) Basic training in specific communication skills and styles that can 
enhance patient motivation for attitudinal and behavioral change, and  
4) Intera ctive, experiential training in delivering brief educational and

TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   [ADDRESS_941185] for use during treatment of high 
risk patients. The intervention is designed to be a practical, patient -centered, 
and activity -based treatment, and will utilize American Physical Therapy 
Association (APTA)  Orthopaedic Section Clinical Practice Guidelines.56  
5.3 Concomitant interventions  
In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_693833], there will be no restrictions on patients 
taking part in other clinical trials.  
5.4 Adherence  assessment   
5.4.1  Patient adherence : Patient s will be compensated for their participation in data 
collection:  one payment of $15 will be mailed after the completion of the 6-
month  assessment.  All care will be paid for through existing health insurance 
benefit structures , established programs for underserved patients,  or will be 
self-pay.  
5.4.2  Provider adherence : Approaches will be implemented to enhance provider 
adherence within the context of the EMR. PCP  stakeholder s strongly believed 
that time restrictions would not permit them to enter into the EMR t he data 
necessary to identify baseline characteristics (2- item chronic questionnaire, 
STar T Back  Tool, and Oswestry LBP Questionnaire). As a result, the portal or 
tablet -based approaches programmed within the EMR environment would be 
the first line of data  collection  utilized uniformly throughout the study sites. 
Portal and t ablet -based approaches are becoming increasingly implemented in 
PCP environments, supporting  generalizability. The study team will  not dictate 
treatment fidelity approaches for PT provi der adherence, but will implement  a 
“checklist” that includes reference guidelines for the PI[INVESTIGATOR_693849] . This 
checklist will be included in the routine communication that occurs between the 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_102752] a referring PCP.

6.2 Description of evaluations  
6.2.1  Screening evaluation: Patients receiving care for acute back pain will be 
given the three -part assessment  during the PCP visit scheduling process (up to 
seven days  prior) or upon arrival at the clinical site. Candidates will be deemed 
eligible for the study if they are identified as an acute LBP patient. Those in the 
high risk STarT Back group will be identified for enroll ment  in the RCT for the 
primary and secondary outcomes, and those in the low  or medium  risk STarT 
Back groups will be identified for enroll ment  in the observational cohort for 
secondary outcomes . The screening evaluations are part of normal practice, 
and results for all screened pat ients will be available for clinical staff to use in 
the EMR.  
6.2.2  Consent process : The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159499] 
(IRB) has approved a waiver of informed consent/HIPAA authorization to access, record, and use protected patient health i nformation/patient medical 
record information for review and analysis of medical recorddata for the 
conduct of this study at UPMC clinics and Intermountain Healthcare clinics . It 
has also approved a waiver for the requirement to obtain a written  informed 
consent for completion of questionnaires and interviews at those sites.  Verbal 
consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_693905] [ADDRESS_941186] office 
with a consent template with their name [CONTACT_693922]. The re search 
involves no more than minimal risk to the participant, the waiver s will not 
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   [ADDRESS_941187] the rights and welfare of the participant, and the research 
could not practicably be carried out without the waiver s.  
 
Specifically,  
• The study is comparing two standard- of-care treatments that patients  could 
receive regardless of participation in the study , 
• These standard clinical approaches do not require consent outside of the 
research context , 
• A total sample size of at least 8,760 participants is needed from these sites 
to meet the aims of the study ,  
• The study needs to be conducted within the clinical setting (i.e ., a 
pragmatic trial) , which typi[INVESTIGATOR_693850] <15 minutes per patient visit ; the 
consent/authorization procedures would disrupt the clinical set ting and 
potentially impact patient care . 
6.2.3  Enrollment and baseline evaluation : Upon determination of eligibility, 
patients will be enrolled in the QI initiative of the study. Baseline data  will be 
contained in the EMR and extracted for study purposes , inclu ding screening 
results , demographic information, billing information, and clinical data (e.g., 
diagnoses, referrals  to specialists ). Patients identified as high risk, acute LBP 
patients in the intervention arm will be referred to PI[CONTACT_6214], and this referral wi ll 
also be captured in the EMR.  The list of baseline variables to be extracted from 
the EMR is provided in Appendix 6.  
6.2.4  Randomization : As a cluster RCT, randomization will occur at the clinic level 
and not the patient level ; therefore, randomization is not a factor in the 
enrollment or baseline evaluation.  
6.2.5  Follow -up: Follow -up to the initial screening and QI enrollment visit will occur 
through three mechanisms:  
1) Referral to PI[CONTACT_6214] : For eligible patients referred to PI[CONTACT_6214], follow  up at PT 
will be evaluated throug h the checklist completed at the PT visit and 
returned to the PCP site. This checklist will indicate use of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_693851].  
2) Six-month assessment : Research staff will contact [CONTACT_693906] [ADDRESS_941188]  the 
Chronic LBP Questionnaire and the Oswestry to assess the primary 
outcomes.   
3) Medical resource utilization : Researchers will also extract data from 
the EMR  at select sites   to determine the secondary outcome of  LBP-
related medical resource utilization of tests, procedures, and 
pharmaceuticals by [CONTACT_693907] 12 months  after the initial visit . 
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   [ADDRESS_941189] of variables  for medical resource utilization is provided in 
Appendix 6.  
7 Safety assessments   
All clinical activities r elated to this trial will be performed in accordance with normal clinical 
practice. Safety concerns and adverse events arising from clinical operations within the 
PCP or PT settings will also follow normal clinical procedures . Adverse events related to 
the research study would be limited to  a data breach of confidentiality. This would not 
require patient report but would require study report, following Office of Information Security protocols  at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_693852].   
8 Intervention discontinuation 
Enrollees who do not follow the clinical practices contemplated within this trial or do not 
respond to the follow -up calls will be documented but not discontinued.  
9 Statistical considerations  
9.1 General design issues  
9.1.1  A primary aim ( PA1)  is to determine in  patients  with acute LBP who are 
deemed high risk  for transition to chronic,  what is the proportion of patients 
transitioning  to chronic LBP by  [CONTACT_35667]  6-month assessment  who are 
treated with 1) GBC  compared to 2) GBC+PI[CONTACT_6214] . 
9.1.2  H1: GBC+PI[INVESTIGATOR_693853].  
9.1.3  The primary outcome will be determined by [CONTACT_1962]’ responses to the Chronic 
LBP Questionnaire at [ADDRESS_941190]

not specifically target obesity  and smoking, and the relationship of these 
variables to transition to chronic are unclear, group x obesity interactions  are 
not expected . 
9.1.14  Outcomes for this aim will utilize the same measures and sources as PA1- 2, 
SA3 but will also include EMR data on patient co- morbidities, smoking status, 
and socioeconomic status.  
9.1.15  Missing data: Baseline character istics, such as age, gender, and health 
insurance status, will be compared between patients with complete 
assessment  data to those with missing data by [CONTACT_693909]. 
Sensit ivity analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted 
using several methods , which have different missing data assumptions.73  
1) Complete case analyses , which assum es missing data are completely at 
random,  
2) Multiple imputation using M=10 imputations, which assumes missing at 
random, and  
3) Assigning poor scores and good scores for missing values differentially 
by [CONTACT_1570], which aligns with non- ignorable missingness (the 
data missingness is nonrandom and related to the actual value).

 9.2 Randomization , sample size and power –  RCT cohort  
9.2.[ADDRESS_941192] primary outcome of the transition rate to 
chronic LBP  at month 6. We propose to enroll N=1860 high  risk acute LBP 
patients. We are targeting an average of n=31 enrolled high risk patients per 
clinic (60*31=1860) to account for the variation in cluster sizes (assuming 
coefficient of variation=0.65) and 40% non- response rate at 6 months.  
9.2.3  Power : With a t otal of 60 PCP clinics for randomization, m=30 clinics per 
intervention strategy and fixed n=10- [ADDRESS_941193] over 80% power to detect a 40% reduction in transition to chronic LBP assuming the control arm has a transition rate of 25% -
30% and the intraclass correlation is 0.05, which is an upper bound for what 
has been observed in other cluster randomized trials with respect to either pain 
of LBP. Assuming that low and medium risk subjects with acute LBP have an expected 20% transition to chronic  and using  data o n obesity and smoking 
rates based on national surveys , depression rates based on prevalence rates 
reported in primary care, and p roporti ons of underserved patients estimated 
from patient registr ies at each of the five regional sites , the planned sample 
size for the observational cohort is sufficient  to detect at least a 30% relative 
difference (6% absolute difference) from 20% with powers ranging from 79% to 
87%. The study would have 65% power to  detect a 40% relative or 8% 
absolute difference (hypothesized increased rate of transition) for the depression subgroup.     
9.2.4  Treatment assignment procedures: Detect ing an interaction effect the same 
size as the overall intervention effect  would require  a four-fold increase in the 
effective sample size (more clinics and patients accounting for cluste ring), 
which is not feasible.
[ADDRESS_941194] stronger 
intervention effects in some a priori  defined subgroups at the participant level 
(smoking, depression, obesity, lower SES) if the cohort is evenly split.  
9.2.5  Analysis of randomization: Distributions of baseline characteristics for clinics 
and patients will be compared between the study arms to assess effectiveness 
of the randomization, and statistical or clinical differences will be adjusted for in 
sensitivity analyses. All analyses for treatment group comparisons will use an 
intention- to-treat approach and results will be reported us ing the CONSORT 
extension to cluster randomized trials.83 This approach is highly pragmatic per 
the PRECIS -2 primary analysis domain.  
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   27 
 9.3 Randomization, sample size and power – observational cohort  
9.3.1  Randomization  is not applicable to the observational cohort because 
moderate and low risk patients will not receive the PI[INVESTIGATOR_693857].  
9.3.2  Sample size  is again based on a total of 60 PCP clinics. An average of n =115 
patients will be enrolled per clinic, for a total sample of N=6,900 low or medium 
risk acute LBP patients.  
9.3.3  Power : The sample size will a llow precise determination of  1) the transition 
rates for low risk and medium risk acute LBP who receive GBC ; 2) differences 
between low/medium risk patients receiving GBC  in the observational cohort 
and high risk patients receiving GBC  in the intervention group ; and most 
importantly, 3) differences among low/medium risk patients due to specific 
subgroup characteristi cs, in particular patients who are underserved, obese, 
depressed, or smokers. Of the three objectives, the subgroup analyses require 
the greatest sample size, and therefore will be described  in detail here.  
For the purposes of the calculations, from the li terature it is assumed that low 
and medium risk subjects with acute LBP have an expected 20% transition to 
chronic. Data on obesity and smoking rates are based on national surveys. 
Depression rates are based on prevalence rates reported in primary care. Proportions of underserved patients are estimated from patient registries at 
each of the five regional sites. For the underserved, obesity, and smoking subgroups, the given sample sizes in Table [ADDRESS_941195] a 30% relative diffe rence (6% absolute difference) from 20% with 
powers ranging from 79% to 87%. The study would have 65% power to detect

transition) for the depression subgroup.

9.4 Outcomes  
9.4.1  Primary outcome 1: To test the effect of the intervention on preventing the 
transition from acute to chronic LBP (PA1), the study team will  compare the 
rates of transition to chronic LBP at 6 months , based on the results of the 6 
month Chronic LBP Questionnaire,  between enrol led patients at intervention 
clinics and enrolled patients at comparator  clinics.  This comparison will be 
conducted for high risk patients at 6 months (PA1) as well as  low and m edium  
risk patients ( SA4) and specific subgroups ( SA5). 
9.4.2  Primary outcome 2: To test the effect of the intervention on improving patient -
centered outcomes of back -related function (PA2), the study team will compare 
changes in the Oswestry scores from baseline to 6- month assessment  
between enrolled patients at intervention clinics and enrolled patients at 
comparator  clinics. This comparison will be conducted for high risk patients at 6 
months (PA2) as well as low and m edium  risk patients ( SA4) and specific 
subgroups ( SA5). 
9.4.3  Secondary outcomes : To test the effects of the intervention on r educing 
medical resource utilization (SA3) the study team will compare LBP- related 
medical resource utilization data for enrolled patients at intervention clinics and 
enrolled patients at comparator  clinics for a period of 12 months . This 
comparison will be conducted for high risk patients ( SA3) as well as low and 
medium  risk patients ( SA4) and specific subgroups ( SA5). The medical 
resource utilization data will be identified and categorized using Healthcare 
Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level 1 (C PT-4) and 2, and ICD -
10 codes.  These data will be used to evaluate the frequency, intensity and 
composition of services received within the participating PCP/PT practices as 
well as care delivered in other community practices and facilities.  The study 
team will investigate evaluation & management services (PCP & specialist), 
diagnostic testing, rehabilitation services, and medical procedures.  Furthermore, the study team  will also capture prescribing patterns for key drug 
classes commonly used for LBP management such as n on-steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen (Tylenol), opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] , 
skeletal muscle relaxants , antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants and 
duloxetine), and drugs for neuropathic pain (e.g. , gabapentin) .

9.5 Data analyses  
9.5.1  Primary outcome 1: This initial analysis ( PA1) will use a generalized linear 
mixed model with a logit link controlling for block set (see Randomization) and 
a fixed effect for intervention accounting for the cluster RCT  design with a 
random clinic effect. Primary analyses will also adjust for patient characteristics 
(maladaptive pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_693858], functional im pairment as measured by [CONTACT_693910], and presence 
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   29 
 of psychiatric comorbidities), as these have been associated with higher 
transition to chronic LBP.69 The intraclass correlation coefficients will also be 
estimated and reported for all outcome measures to assess the  assumptions 
for sample size analyses and also for future investigations using similar 
designs and outcomes.  Analysis for the secondary  aims (SA4 and SA5) will be 
largely descriptive assessing the proportion of patients who transition to c hronic 
LBP among the low and moderate risk  observational  cohort. The proportion 
and confidence interval will be estimated using generalized linear models 
adjusting for clustering.  
9.5.2  Primary outcome 2: This aim ( PA1) will be analyzed using contrasts from a 
linear mixed models analysis for  6-month back -related function (Oswestry) 
controlling for baseline Oswestry and the block set (see Randomization). The 
intervention will first be explored by [CONTACT_6491], and then proceed to a 
main effects model with only group and time.   For the secondary aims ( SA4 
and SA5) patient -centered outcomes, such as functional status, would use 
general linear models if deemed appropriate based on normality assumptions. 
If normality is hugely violated, a cutpoint for ‘response’ will be applied.  
9.5.3  Secondary outcome : Analyses of health care utilization data (SA3) will use 
generalized linear mixed models with the distribution determined by [CONTACT_693911]. L ogit link (binary distribution) will be used for health 
care outcomes , such as surgery , that are dichotomous (Yes/No) variables. For 
outcomes resulting in count data over the time frame such as number of outpatient visits for back pain, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693859] , Poisson or negative 
binomial distribution with log link will be used to compare the event rates 
controlling for the period of follow up.  The secondary aims ( SA4 and SA5) 
would use a similar approach.

 10 Data collection and quality assurance  
10.1 Data collectio n 
10.1.1  Baseline data: Data collection for the three baseline patient questionnaires 
(Chronic LBP Questionnaire, STarT Back, and Oswestry) will be self -report  via 
an internet -based form in a patient portal, a tablet -based form, or a paper  
questionnaire. The form s via patient portal or tablet will be loaded into the 
EMR . For paper questionnaires, the medical assistant will enter the data 
directly into the EMR. The PT checklist will be completed either electronically or 
on paper, and will also be loaded into the EM R. 
10.1.2  Follow -up data: The study team will extract data from the EMR to determine [ADDRESS_941197] office, entered into a database, and matched with the 
EMR data.   
10.1.3  Medical resource utilization  data: Data for LBP -related use of medical 
resources  during the 12- month assessment  period will be collected for four of 
the five regional sites (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], [LOCATION_011], Baltimore, and Salt Lake City). A ll 
four regional  study sites participate in robust clinical research data networks 
(CRDNs).   [LOCATION_011] Medical Center has access to t he Clinical Data Warehouse 
of [LOCATION_011] University Medical Campus and [LOCATION_011] HealthNet , a partnership 
between [LOCATION_011] Medical Center, [LOCATION_011] University School of Medicine,  and 15 
community health centers that are participating in the study. Data from these resources will allow the capture of comprehensive information regarding the 
LBP- related  medical resource utilization (e.g., office visits, specialty visits, 
tests, procedures, prescriptions, surgeries) .   
10.1.4  Data sweeps: T he EMR administrators and programmers at each site have 
agreed to work with the study team to provide all necessary data . Reporting 
needed for the aims are related to data that need to be regularly pulled from the EMR and provided to practice managers and study personnel. These 
include:  
1) Total numbers of subjects with LBP ICD -10 codes  or who received care 
for back pain during t he primary care clinic visit , 
2) Total numbers of subjects with completed data elements that include:  
• Chronic LBP Questionnaire 
• STarT Back  Questionnaire 
• Oswestry LBP Questionnaire 
All sites have agreed to program into the EMR the data elements above. They 
also agreed to program:  
1) Bi-weekly sweeps of the EMR with a report that documents the ratio of 
completed data sets to total patients enrolled with LBP by [CONTACT_6903]. These 
TARGET  Trial Protocol (Version 3.0; 09/01/2018)   31 
 will be used to assure appropriate recruitment levels at all sites. Reports 
will be directed to PCP champi[INVESTIGATOR_693860].   
2) Regular reports from all of the EMRs of the data elements as well as the 
common data elements. These will be de- identified and sent to the 
coordinating  site (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]), where the Data Integrity Committee will 
work to harmonize all of the data integral to the primary aims of the study 
from the [ADDRESS_941198] ination and quality monitoring : The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_693861] 5 regional sites’ E MR teams. Mo nitoring of the trial will 
be facilitated through regular reports provided to the PIs  and the Steering 
Committee. University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_693862], enrollment, protocol implementat ion, attrition, and safety.  They are also experienced with 
generating Data and Safety Monitoring Reports i n both open and closed 
formats.  
10.2.2  Data source adequacy : In choosing sites, major criteria were an established 
EMR linked with networked PCP clinics. Al l of the  sites fit this  criterion . One of 
the criteria for eligible PCP clinics was past volume of patients with LBP, identified by [CONTACT_48355] -[ADDRESS_941199] of the 
selected clinics were far above that number. The conservative estimate is that  
that 10% of the 400 (40 per clinic) would be acute  and high risk  and therefor e 
eligible , based on past literature for chronic rates, which range from 8-10%.
4,[ADDRESS_941200] -
time visits at primary care clinics across the country. Their analysis of chronicity (defined as 2 or more subsequent visits six  months after the initial visit) verified 
a chronicity rate of <20%. Given  the literature on chronic LBP and the STarT 
Back Tool, and data from OPTUM, 10% is a conservative estimate for a yearly 
yield of 31  patients per clinic.    
10.3 Quality assurance  
10.3.1  Methods used to ensure unbiased and systematic data collection from all participants : The major sources of potential bias in data collection with a 
cluster -RCT design lie in 1) the sel ection of sites and 2) missing or incomplete 
data collection once subjects are enrolled within a site. EMRs of all 
participating PC P clinics will be analy zed every two weeks for data completion 
rates (# completed data sets/total number of possible data sets). De -identified 
aggregate data completion rates will be provided to the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_693863] e champi[INVESTIGATOR_693864] a 
biweekly basis. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_693865], using in person and teleconference visits as needed . During

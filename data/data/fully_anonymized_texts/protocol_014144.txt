BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICAN CE 19 
 20 
Physiologic insulin replacement for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, or  intensive insulin 21 
therapy, is administered either by [CONTACT_213428] (MDI) of insulin or via continuous 22 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via insulin pump.  Since its inception in the 1970’s, CSII has 23 
improved continuously in terms of both the devices and the rapid acting  insulin analogues they 24 
deliver so that today’s insulin pumps are considered the “gol d standard” of intensive insulin 25 
therapy.  However,  CSII has  only  shown advantages over MDI regimens which used older  basal 26 
insulin products including intermediate -acting insulin (NPH) and first generation ins ulin 27 
analogues (glargine and detemir) in cluding  reducing the incidence of hypoglycemia, improving 28 
overall glycemic control and  improving gly cemic variability  (1,2) .  CSII  also has advantages in [ADDRESS_256239] with 31 
bolus calculations. However, patients treated with CSII continue to show  significant glycemic 32 
variability owing to  different absorption characteristics of insulin infused subcut aneously at 33 
different body si tes and due to the  inherent  variability of absorption of  rapid -acting insulin 34 
analogues even when infused continuously in sub -unit quantities for basal insulin delivery by 35 
modern insulin pumps.   36 
Insulin degludec is a new ultra long -acting insulin analogue with a unique mechanism of 37 
protraction giving it a flat, peakless p harmacodynamic profile with a coefficient of variation of 38 
the glucose infusion rate  of appr oximately 25% that of insulin glargine  in glucose clamp studies 39 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  2 
 and a half -life of 25  hours  (3).  Insulin degludec has  also been shown to have a reduced 40 
incidence of hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine in a head -to head clinical trial in 41 
patients with type 1 diabetes. (4).  Whether insuli n degludec might  provide equivalent  basal [ADDRESS_256240] not been compared in a clinical trial.  Part 44 
of the reason for th is is because patients using CSII use a pump for both the basal and bolus 45 
component of their insulin regimen; currently, no “bolus only” insulin delivery device exists.  46 
Also, there was no compelling reason until now to study a hybrid model for basal/bolus  insulin [ADDRESS_256241] which had any therapeutic 48 
advantage over basal insulin delivered by [CONTACT_213429].   Furthermore, it is now recognized that the use 49 
of insulin infusion sets of various design in CSII lead to inc reased glucose variability by [CONTACT_57216] 50 
local inflammation and micro -occlusions of the sets, which interfere with consistent insulin 51 
basal delivery (5).   Insulin degludec, however, appears in clinical use to possibly have a flatter 52 
glycemic profile than CS II can provide, with  equivalent or even  lower glycemic variability and 53 
less hypoglycemia.  If so, patients with type 1 diabetes may achieve better overall glycemic 54 
control with, and therefore prefer , a daily injection of insulin degludec for their basal in sulin 55 
needs in combination with their pump (with its bolus calculator) for their bolus insulin needs.   [ADDRESS_256242] of a daily injection of 57 
insulin degludec vs. basal insulin delivery via CSII, both in combination with bolus insulin 58 
delivery via the patient’s usual insulin pump with insulin aspart, on glycemic variability, overall 59 
blood glucose control and incidence of hypoglycemia, all assessed by [CONTACT_213430] 60 
monitor (CGM), as well as pat ient satisfaction, in patients with type 1 diabetes currently using 61 
CSII.  62 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES  63 
The primary  objective of this trial is to determine whether insulin degludec will provide  an 64 
equally  stab le and consistent basal glycemic profile  with lower glycemic va riability  as 65 
determined by [CONTACT_213431] 1  66 
diabetes experienced in use of insulin pump therapy.  Specifically, this study will determine if 67 
the percent time in the target glycemic range (70 to 180 mg/dl) by [CONTACT_213432] [ADDRESS_256243] deviation (SD) of the mean daily glucose by [CONTACT_28047].  P articular 70 
attention will be given to the nocturnal glucose profile  (from midnight to 6 am) which most [ADDRESS_256244] affected by [INVESTIGATOR_123932] 72 
insulin, food intake or exercise.  Quality of life questionnaires regarding treatment preference 73 
will be used to capture patient preference for method of basal insulin delivery.  74 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND MET HODS  75 
Study hypothesis   76 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  3 
 It is anticipated, based on the low glycemic variability of insulin degludec shown in glucose 77 
clamp studies and seen in clinical practice, that insulin degludec will provide more stable 24 78 
hour basal insulin action than insulin aspar t by [CONTACT_213429] i n patients with type 1 diabetes.  79 
OUTCOME MEASURES/SPECIFIC ENDPOINTS  80 
 81 
Primary endpoint   82 
Percent time in euglycemia (BG 70  to 180 mg/dl) by [CONTACT_213433] 14 days of each 83 
treatment period during steady state  (with basal insulin delivery as either one daily injection of 84 
insulin degludec or as insulin aspart via CSII).  85 
 86 
Key secondary endpoints  87 
 88 
1. SD of interstitial fluid glucose  by [CONTACT_213434] 2 week period during each basal insulin 89 
delivery method . (Note: because the Dexcom Platinum G5 CGM is currently only FDA 90 
approved for 7 days of use, two contiguous CGM periods using 2 sensors, each for 7 91 
days, will be performed to capture 2 weeks of continuous CGM data.)  Dexcom G6 is 92 
approved by [CONTACT_213435] 10 days of use so 2 sensor s will be used durin g the CGM periods.  93 
2. SD of blood glucose by [CONTACT_213436] (midnight to 6 am) during each 94 
basal insulin delivery method  95 
 96 
Other secondary endpoints  97 
1. Percent time in hypoglycemia by [CONTACT_28047] , captured at  2 levels of hypoglycemia: B G < 54 98 
mg/dl (level 2) and BG  55-69 mg/dl  (level 1) , for each basal insulin treatment.  99 
2. Percent time in normo glycemia ( BG 70  to 140 mg/dl) by [CONTACT_213437] 100 
treatment period.  101 
3. Time to recovery  from level 2 hypoglycemia  (BG >70 with resolution of symptoms) on 102 
each treatment.  If a second event (BG < 70 mg/dl) occurs within 60 minutes of a 103 
previous hypoglycemic event, this w ill be considered part of the same hypoglycemic 104 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  105 
4. Patient satisfaction by [CONTACT_213438] -D and TRIM -DD questionnaire s with each basal insulin 106 
treatment.   107 
5. HbA1c after 20  weeks  of each basal insulin treatment.  108 
6. Total daily insulin dose, total basal insulin dose, and total bolus insulin dose on each 109 
treatment.  110

will be measured.  113 
STUDY TYPE  114 
V2.0, 7/13/ [ADDRESS_256245] of a 4 week insulin 117 
optimization period for titration of basal and bolus insulin doses, followed by a 16 week 118 
maintenance period.  The final 2 weeks of the maintenance period  during each treatment arm  119 
will be used for endpoint data collection.   The treatment sequence will occur in random order.  120 
The study population will include patients with type 1 diabetes with good baseline glycemic 121 
control who are experienced in the use of both CSII and CGM; the cross -over design allows each [ADDRESS_256246] to serve as his or her own control.  123 
STUDY POPULATION   124 
In order to confirm a 10% improvement in the time spent in euglycemia by [CONTACT_213439] 85% 125 
power, 47 subjects will be studied.  Thus, between 55 and 60 subjects will be screened to allow 126 
for a 10% drop -out rate. (See “Statistical Analysis Plan” for sample size calculation.)  127 
INCLUSION CR ITER IA 128

 3. Subjects not using CSII and CGM (ie, on MDI)  155 
4. Subjects inexperienced in the use of CSII, or whose pump download shows poor 156 
utilization of bolus calculator features,  ie fewer than 2 boluses per day, lack of 157 
correction boluses, frequent overrides of the recommended boluses, unrealistic  158 
carbohydrate entries (suggestive of  under -bolusing), not changing infusion set at least 159 
every 3 days, or other evid ence of poor insulin pump usage . 160 
5. Subjects inexperienced in or n ot regular users (>85% of time) of Dexcom G 5 or G6 CGM  161 
6. Subjects who are using a Medtronic pump with low blood glucose suspend who are 162 
unwilling to use the Dexcom CGM or to disengage the low blood glucose suspend 163 
feature of the pump.  164

10. Known or suspected allergy to study products, their excipi[INVESTIGATOR_213423].  169 
11. Previo us participation in this trial. N ote: subjects who screen fail because of A1c may 170 
rescreen once if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the HbA1c was explainable (ie, 171 
recent s teroid injection or illness, etc) and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_213424].  172 
12. Hypoglycemic unawareness.  173 
13. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_66677] (requiring assistance for treatment) within the previous [ADDRESS_256251] of the change of insulin  regimen  itself.  Allowing the subjects 191 
to use their insulin pumps for bolus insulin delivery, as they are accustomed, will minimize the 192 
chances of skippi[INVESTIGATOR_213425].   193 
 194 
Replacing basal insulin delivery by [CONTACT_213441] a single daily injection of degludec will add minimal, 195 
if any, treatment burden which will be offset by [CONTACT_213442].  These benefits 196 
include the potential for reduced glycemic variability and  the elimination of the risk of 197 
V2.0, 7/13/ [ADDRESS_256252] from their pumps safely  without 200 
sacrificing glycemic control  for prolonged periods of time ( which is not an option  using CSII for 201 
basal insulin delivery).  202

VISIT PROCEDURES  205 
 206 
Please see pages 16 -18 for “Visit Procedures”, which describes a detailed list of procedures and 207 
assessments at each visit, and  page 19  for the  “Study Flow Sheet”, which summarizes study - 208 
related procedures at each visit in spreadsheet format.  209 
 210 
ASSESSMENTS OF EFFICACY  211 
 212 
Primary endpoint   213 
Percent time spent in euglycemia by [CONTACT_28047]: data will be downloaded from the Dexcom G5 or G6 214 
(either by [CONTACT_213443] -based application); this will yield  215 
the percent time in euglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and SD for  endpoint analy ses. 216 
 217 
Other endpoints  218 
1. HbA1c: This will be measured by [CONTACT_12115] (LabCorp, Burlington, NC). 2. GlycoMark 219 
(1,5 anhydroglucitol) will be measured by [CONTACT_213444] (LabCorp, Burlington, NC).   All [ADDRESS_256253] 225 
increased postmeal basal insulin  infusion  rates ( to compensate for inadequate mealtime insulin 226 
dosing)  which cannot be reproduced in the degludec treatment arm.  227 
 228 
ASSESSMENTS OF SAFETY:  229 
 230 
Hypoglycemia will be captured by [CONTACT_213445]. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_55094] 231 
hypoglycemia (requiring assistance) will be documented and reported as AE’s  in diaries .  232 
Categories of hypoglycemia that will be captured include: pe rcent time in two categories of 233 
hypoglycemia ( BG < 54 mg dl and 55 -69 mg/dl) by [CONTACT_28047], epi[INVESTIGATOR_213426] -confirmed 234 
hypoglycemia (<54  mg/dl), nocturnal hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia.  In the event 235 
where the SMBG and the CGM readings are discordant, the SMBG will be considered the 236 
primary source.  237 
 238 
Time to r ecovery from hypoglycemia , defined as BG > 70 with resolution of symptoms,  during 239 
each treatment will  also be captured.  240 
 241 
V2.0, 7/13/ [ADDRESS_256254] diaries.  Number of missed 256 
injections will be captur ed during the degludec treatment arm; num ber of infusion set changes, 257 
set occlusions , and missed boluses will be captured during both  treatment arm s. 258 
 259 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  260 
 261 
Sample Size Determination  262 
The subjects in a recent study (4) should closely reflect the population we are going to study. 263 
Using the statistics from that source as an estimate of population parameters, power analyses 264 
were done for: (1) percent time in euglycemia (BG 70 to 180 mg/dl),  desired effect size 0.4, (2) [ADDRESS_256255] size 0.44, and (3) HbA1c,  desired effect size 0.44. The repeated 266 
independent variable is degludec vs CSII. These a priori analyses – using G*Power, version 267 
[IP_ADDRESS] http://www.gpow er.hhu.de/en.html  – assumed a Type I error of .05 and a power of .85 268 
(Type II error of .15).  [ADDRESS_256256] at  n = 47. 271 
Allowing for a 10% dropout rate a final sample size of 53 will be sou ght – more if possible.  272 
 273 
Statistical Methods  274 
 275 
Ho: For Type 1 DM subjects using degludec vs CSII, there is no difference between mean 276 
percent time in euglycemia, mean SD of BG by [CONTACT_28047], or mean HbA1c.  277 
 278 
Ha: For Type 1 DM patients using degludec vs CSII, there  will be mean differences between 279 
percent time in euglycemia, SD of BG by [CONTACT_28047], and HbA1c. (No one tailed tests are planned.)  [ADDRESS_256257] use degludec  for 20 weeks then switch to CSII for 20 weeks. As 283 
all eligible pa tients who sign the IRB consent form are identified, a random number will  be 284 
V2.0, 7/13/ [ADDRESS_256258]. The other group of patients 285 
will start with CSII and after 2 0 weeks switch to Tresiba for 20 weeks. Randomization sequence 286 
will be determined by [CONTACT_213446].  All patients will receive both 287 
treatments unless they drop out. Dropouts are unlikely since the participants are all regular 288 
continuing patients of the site’s clinical practi ce. 289 
 290 
Since each patient will be measured twice - insulin degludec vs CSII by [CONTACT_213447] – this repeated 291 
measure will be the dependent variable . 292 
Since study participants are a ll ongoing patients of the three  physicians at the site, there should 293 
be no missing data , per -protocol, or intention -to-treat issues. Only patients who complete the 294 
entire 46-week study will be used in the final analysis.  295 
 296 
No continuous or ratio variables will be categorized.  297 
 298 
No interim analysis will be performed.  299 
 300 
Control/covariate variable s 301 
These will be  recorded at the beginning of the study to help reduce error variance in the 302 
dependent measures:  303 
1) Time elapsed since diagnosis of Type 1 DM (ratio variable)  304 
2) Age (ratio variable)  305 
3) Physician attending each patient – there are 3 physicians (nominal).  306 
4) Whether each patient started with CSII by [CONTACT_213448] (nominal)  307 
5) Race of patient (if there is any variability; unlikely) (nominal).  308 
 309 
Statistical Analysis  310 
Statistical analyses  will be performed using STATA version 15.0, revision 25, released 311 
September 2017.  (www.stata.com ) 312 
Since all the dependent variables are interval and the independent and control/covariate 313 
variables are a mixture of ratio and nominal, a General Linea r Model for Repeated Measures 314 
analysis can be used. Depending on the final sample sizes a hierarchical stepwise analysis could 315 
be performed to identify the more useful control/covariate variables.  [ADDRESS_256259] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  317 
The study data (CGM data a nd laboratory endpoints including HbA1c and Gl ycoMark) will be [ADDRESS_256260] - 320 
protected Excel spreadsheets.  Hypoglycemia diaries will be on paper and store d as source 321 
documents along with paper CRF’s capturing study -related procedures (history, physical exam, 322 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  9 
 vital signs, con meds, AE’s) at each visit.  Patients will complete TRIM -D and TRIM -DD 323 
questionnaires, and responses will be tabulated into Excel sprea dsheets for statistical analysis.  324 
All paper source documents and CRFs will be stored on site. All electronic data will be stored in 325 
the cloud in HIPAA -compliant electronic files . 326 
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  327 
The sponsor  (Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine Center), its investigator s and site staff  will 328 
comply with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements, ICH GCP guidelines and the 329 
Declaration of Helsinki in obtaining and documenting the informed consent . 330 
Informed consent will be obtained by a medically quali fied site member (MD or RN) after each [ADDRESS_256261] information for the IRB, the site, and the study principal 340 
investigator.  341 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines and the Declaration of 342

Nordisk) with insulin aspart (administered as bolus insulin via insulin pump) (Novolog, Novo 356 
Nordisk) for one treatment arm; insulin aspart (Novolog) administered by [CONTACT_213449] 357 
and bolus insulin in second treatment arm.   358 
Study Devices: subjects’ own insulin pumps will include Medtronic (530, 730 models; no low 359 
blood glucose  suspend models or closed loop pumps will be used),  Animas Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Animas Vibe, 360 
Tandem T -slim and Insulet Omnipod.  361 
The study CGM will be Dexcom  G5 or G6 . 362 
PACKAGING AND LABELLING OF STUDY MEDICATION AND DEVICES  363 
Study insulins (insulin degludec and aspart) will be distributed at study visits to each subject 364 
from the site.  Insulin degludec will be supplied in injection pens (5 per box for U100 and 3 per 365 
box for U200).  Insulin aspart will be supplied in vials (as bolus insulin will be administered vi a 366 
insulin pump.) Subjects will use their own insulin pumps and pump supplies during the study.  367 
Dexcom sensors will be supplied for a two week period (using one sensor weekly) at baseline 368 
and for the final two weeks of each treatment period.  These will be  distributed and placed at 369 
CGM dispensing/ insertion site visits (see study visit flow sheet).  370 
STORAGE AND DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY OF STUDY MEDICATION  371 
Study insulins will be received in temperature -controlled containers and the temperature of the 372 
medication  upon receipt  will be recorded.  Study insulins will be stored at the study site in 373 
refrigerators maintained between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius; the temperature  will be  monitored 374 
and recorded daily.  No trial medication will be dispensed to any individual not enrolled in  the 375 
study.   All medication used in the study will be recorded in the CRF at each study dispensing 376 
visit.  Subjects will be provided with sufficient stud y insulin for study completion.  377 
Subjects will be instructed not to refrigerate opened insulin degludec (Tresiba U100 & U200) [ADDRESS_256265] at room temperature.  Properly stored opened insulin degludec can be 379 
used for up to 8 weeks (7).  Subjects  may choose to refrigerate or not refrigerate an opened vial 380 
of insulin aspart ( Novolog ), maintaining the vial at a temperature of less than 86°F (30° C) for up 381 
to 4 weeks (8).  382 
AUXILIARY SUPPLY  383 
Study subjects will use their own insulin pumps and insulin pump supplies.  384 
Dexcom glucose sensors ([ADDRESS_256266]) will be purchased by [CONTACT_213450] 385 
for two weeks at 3 times (baseline and for the final two weeks of each treatment period).  [ADDRESS_256267]’s own device (not likely).  Subjects will use their own sensors for each treatment 389 
period except for th e 3 two week period s of CGM data capture as described above.  390

  391 
 392 
RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  393 
This is an unblinded study as the two basal insulin delivery methods (degludec via injection vs. 394 
aspart via CSII) cannot be blinded. For a description of the randomization and treatment 395 
allocation, please refer to the Statistical Methods section above.  396 
CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS  397 
Definitions:  398 
Concomitant illness: any illness that is present at the start of the trial (at the f irst study visit).  399 
Concomitant medication: any medication other than the trial product(s) that is taken during the 400 
trial, including the screening and run -in periods.  401 
Details of all concomitant illnesses and medication will be recorded at trial entry ( at the first 402 
study visit). Any change s in concomitant medication will  be recorded at each visit.  403 
The information collected for each concomitant medication  will include  start date, stop date or 404 
continuing, and indication.  405 
For each concomitant illness, date of onset, date of resoluti on or continuing, will  be recorded.  406 
 407 
ADVERSE EVENTS  408 
 409 
Adverse events will be captured at each study visit and recorded on CRF’s.  Special AE and SAE [ADDRESS_256268] been created to capture these events.  SAE’s will be reported within 24 411 
hours of discovery to appropriate local and federal authorities as w ell as to the IRB when 412 
appropriate.  The study site will comply with  all local legal, regulatory, and  IntegReview  IRB 413 
requirements.   414 
Mountain Diabetes and Endocrine Center, its investigators, and site staff will be responsible for 415

DEFINITIONS  432 
Adverse Event (AE):  [ADDRESS_256270](s). This includes events reported from the first trial related activity [ADDRESS_256271] treatment  follow -up period as 436 
defined in the p rotocol.  This will also include any events related to the malfunction  of a 437 
medical device (i.e. an insulin pump or Dexcom CGM).  The following will not be recorded as 438 
AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening:  439 
• Pre -planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has    [ADDRESS_256272] has signed the informed consent  441 
• Pre -existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures   442 
Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event:  443 
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically significant , 444 
i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or orga n toxicity and is of a severity  which 445 
requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of trial product, more 446 
frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigation).  447 
 448 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  449 
A serious AE is an event that  results in any of the following:  450 
• Death  451 
• A life -threatening* experience  452 
• In-patient ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_73606]  453 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  454 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  455 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threate ning*, or require  [ADDRESS_256273] always be considered an SAE.  460 
*The term life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at [ADDRESS_256274] caused death if it was more 462 
severe.  463 
 464 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Event (S[LOCATION_003]R):  [ADDRESS_256275] -relate d S[LOCATION_003]Rs in accordance with reporting 467 
requirements and GCP guidelines.  468 
V2.0, 7/13/ 2018  13 
  469 
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):  470 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship 471 
(Possible/Probable relation) between the study drug and the occurrence of the ev ent is [ADDRESS_256276] (MESI):  A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g. wrong drug 476 
administration or wrong route of  administration) or (2) a suspected transmission of an [ADDRESS_256277]  478 
 479 
Non -Serious Adverse Event:  480 
A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil l the definition of an SAE.  481 
 482 
Severity Assessment Definitions:  483 
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  484 
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities  485 
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable  486 
 487 
Relationship to stud y medication Assessment Definitions:   488 
• Probable: Good reason  and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  489 
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  490 
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial product  491 
 492 
Outcome Categories and Definitions:  493 
 494 
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by [CONTACT_57676] [ADDRESS_256278] signed the informed 496 
consent  497 
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. [ADDRESS_256279] has completed the trial  499 
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and     500 
significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any A E recovered with 501 
sequelae will  be rated as an SAE  502 
• Not recovered  503 
• Fatal  504 
• Unknown  [ADDRESS_256280] -treatment follow -up period as stated in the protocol.  All adverse events 511

All adverse events classified as serious or severe or possibly/probably r elated to the trial [ADDRESS_256284] been resolved.  527 
For cases of chronic conditions , follow -up until the outcome category is “recovered” is not 528 
required, as these cases can be closed with an outcome of “recovering” or “not recovered”.  529 
All other adverse events will  be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering” (for 530 
chronic con ditions), or “recovered” or until the end of the post -treatment follow -up stated in [ADDRESS_256285] been 532 
resolved.  533 
 534 
Pregnancy  535 
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the site and stud y physician immediately if they 536 
become pregnant.  537

APPENDIX: METHOD OF CONVERSION OF BASAL INSULIN BY [CONTACT_213451]  [ADDRESS_256296] dose of insulin degludec will be administere d on day one and a 50% temporary basal [ADDRESS_256297] hourly infusion rate (0.025 units per hour or 0.05 units 609 
per hour for a total daily basal insulin dose of either 0.6 or 1.2 units per day) for the duration of 610 
the insulin degludec treatment arm, with the remainder of the basal insuli n dose administered 611 
as a single daily Tresiba injection.  612 
 613 
The 24 hour basal insulin dose by [CONTACT_213452] a unit -for-unit basis.  614 
This is because both degludec and CSII are roughly equivalent methods with high efficiency 615 
(bioavailab ility) for delivery of a basal insulin dose.  Although there are no head -to-head studies 616 
comparing basal insulin dose by [CONTACT_213453], c linical studies (and the experience  of the 617 
investigator) suggest  that the lowest basal insulin requirement for any g iven subject will be with 618 
either CSII or degludec compared to glargine, NPH or detemir.  619

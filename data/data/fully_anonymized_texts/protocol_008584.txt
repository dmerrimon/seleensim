2 STUDY DESCRIPTION
2.1 Study Design
This study is a rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controll ed, parallel arm clinical trial in 
subjects receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) with a recent Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) or 
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA).
The study consists of two parts.  Part [ADDRESS_231100] a treatm ent 
period of  90 days.  Subjects enrolling in Part 1 will not be all owed in Part 2.  The figures below

subjects wi th lacunar i nfarcts will be capped at approximately  20%.
In addit ion to the two Parts of the study  noted above, which are related to treatm ent durati on, the 
study also consists of two phase s, each with a slight ly different method of assigning study 
treatm ent.  InPhase A, subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 using IVRS to one of twodoses of 
BMS -986141 (0.8 mg or 4.8 mg) or placebo.  In Phase B, subjects will be rando mized 1:1:1:1 
via IVRS to one of three doses of BMS-986141 (0.8 mg, 4.8 mg, or 8 mg) or placebo .  The 
transi tion from Phase Ato Phase Bof the study will only occur after an Independent Data 
Moni toring Commit tee (DMC) has reviewed data from the first 10% of the planned subjects 
(approximately 132 subjects wit h 28 days of data). As o f the time of  the wri ting of this SAP, the 
decisio n to move from Part [ADDRESS_231102]’s management, procedures are in place to have 
the blind broken for an individual subject.
Except as noted, BMS Research and Devel opment personnel, as well as all vendors responsible
for the conduct of the trial (protocol  team) will remain blinded for the durati on of the trial. The
Data Moni toring Commi ttee (DMC) will assess safety  on an ongoing basis, and will have access
to unblinded treatm ent codes. An analysis team , including a reporti ng statistician and
programming supp ort, who are not involved wi th the conduct of  the study , will provide analyses
to the DMC. This unblinded analysis team  will not provide any informat ion from unblinded
analyses to the protocol team until after the trial has been co mpleted.
The Bioanaly tical Sciences section or its designate will be unblinded to the rando mized
treatm ent assignments in order to minimize unnecessary analysis of sam ples from control  group
subjects. Likewise, the Biotransformati on section or its designate may be unblinded, if
1.[ADDRESS_231103] n otably , the original planned high dose of BMS-
986141 was reduced from 
16 m g to 8 m g, and this arm  of the study  is to be cl osed off until  the Data Moni toring Commi ttee 
is able to ev aluate sufficient safet y data from the 2 lower dose groups (0.8 mg and 4.8 mg).  To 
that effect, the randomizat ion scheme was updated to keep the 8mg arm closed until the DMC 
convened.  Pending the outcom e of the DMC meet ing, the 8mg arm would open and 
rando mizat ion woul d proceed in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_231104] to on e of the three BMS -
986141 doses or placebo (see Table 5 -1).
Addit ional updates were made to clarify various aspects of the study  and can be found in the 
protocol  revisi on.  No f urther updates had a significant impact to the statistical methods planned 
for this study .

4.1.1 Symptomatic Stroke
All cases of suspected recurrent stroke will be adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Events
Adjudicat ion Commit tee (CEC). Diagnosis of stroke will require the abrupt onset of focal 
1.[ADDRESS_231109] of care. It isstrongly recommended (but not required) that an
imaging procedure such as a CT scan or MRI be performed to evaluate events of suspected 
stroke or TIA. 
Adjudicated strokes will becategori zed by [CONTACT_194705], defini te hemorrhagic, 
hemorrhagic transform ationor type uncertain. Addi tional classificat ion of stroke subtypes will 
be specified in the CEC charter.
4.1.[ADDRESS_231110] will be reviewed 
independent ly by [CONTACT_194706](IAC) to 
determine if any new areas of infarct ion have developed since the baseline MRI. These 
independent assessments will undergo adjud ication according tothe processes described in the 
Imaging Charter with a single, adjudicated determinat ion recorded for each subject.
4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
Secondary  endpoints include:
The incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) by[CONTACT_2006] 90, defined as a 
composite of adjudicated recurrent stroke, myocardi al infarct ion, or cardiovascular -related

7.1.2 General Methods for Efficacy Analyses
Generalized Mult iple Co mparison Modelling (gMCP -Mod)
To demonstrate the dose-response relationship between BMS -986141 treatm ent (including
placebo) andtheprimary  endpoint, the primary analysis will be based on a generalized Multiple 
Com parisons and Modeling (gMCP -Mod) analysis56.This analysis tests for a dose-response 
relationship, allowing for uncertaint y in the dose-response relationship through inclusio n of 
contrasts from multiplepre-specified candi date models to assess dose-response. If a dose-
response relationship exists, then fitted estimates for the incidence of the primary endpo int will 
be calculated in each of the treatm ent groups using the selected dose -response model s.
The gMCP -Mod procedure extends the MCP -Mod methodol ogy to 
non-continuous endpoints.  
This is accomplished by [CONTACT_194709]-response model from the expected response 
through the use of an ANOVA style parameteri zation of the dose-response parameter.  For the 
binary endpo int used in this study , a logistic regressi on of  the event proporti on at each dose level 
will be used, following adjustment for study time period (1A, 2A, 2B) via the inclusio n of an 
additive covari ate.  After this first step, the mean parameter estimates from the logistic model 
and the corresponding covari ance matrix, both of which areon the logit scale, will then be used 
during the rest of the gMCP -Mod procedure.  Point estimates from the selected modelswill be 
displayed on the proportion scale in all statist ical outputs.
Candi date Model sand Mul tiple Test ing Procedure
There are two candidate models that will be considered for the primary  analysis.  These arean 
Emax model and a logistic model, where dose-response will be tested using dose levels of 0 
(placebo), 1, 2, and 2. 3(corresponding to 0.8 mg, 4.8 mg, and 8mg)7.
The MCP -Mod p rocedure requi res certain parameter estimates be pre-specified for the candidate 
models based on available inform ation in order to derive optimum contrast coefficients for 
testing the null hypothesis: that a dose -response does not exist in any of the candi date m odels.  It 
1.[ADDRESS_231119] for testing will 
assume a placebo event rate of 14% and maximum ri sk reducti on of 4.2%.  For the Em ax m odel, 
the requi red param eter estimates used will be1.[ADDRESS_231120] and 1.0 for a “Hill”parameter that determines the steepness of the model at the 
dose of half effect. For the logistic model, theseparam eter estimates used will be 1.[ADDRESS_231121] coefficients follow the form given below, and will be recalculated as 
described using the DoseFinding package in R once the actual data are available.
     ∝       −  ′   1
1    1 
Where µmis the event rate on the logit scale based on the corresponding candidate model m 
(m=1, 2) at the specified dose levels, and S corresponds to the covari ance matrix from  the 
logistic regressio n on the actual data in the first step.
In order to demonstrate a dose-response relationship, the following global hypothesis will be 
tested :
H0:      µ ≥0 for all m {1, 2}
H1:      µ < [ADDRESS_231122] one m {1, 2}
where µ is the true event rate on the l ogit scal e at the specified dose levels.
For each candidate model (m=1, 2), thecontrast test statistic (zm)is calculated as standardized 
linear combinations of the estimated event rate on the logit scale from the logistic regressio n
using the optimal contrast coefficients associ ated wi th that candi date m odel. 
A multiplicit y-adjusted critical value will be determi ned from the joint multivariate norm al 
distribut ion of the contrast test stati stics at the overall one-sided alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_231123] oyed using a 
weighted averaging technique based on their relative Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), for 
the purposes of estimation .  If neither candidate model has a contrast test statistic that is greater 
than or equal  to the multiplicit y-adjusted cri tical value, then the analysis will  end, indicat ing that 
a dose -response relat ionship cannot be established.
In this manner, the point estimates for the means will be generated from the selected model as 
described in the efficac y analyses in Sect ion 7.5.

Where a subject has multiple adverse events within the level of summarizat ion in a single 
analysis period, the subject will only be counted once atthat levelof summarizat ionin the 
adverse event frequency  tables.
When a subject has the same adverse event , based on preferred termino logy, reported multiple 
times in a single analysis period, the following criteria, in order of precedence, will be used to 
select the event to be included in summary tables:
Relationship to study  medicat ion
Intensit y of event
When reporting adverse events by [CONTACT_2236], summary  tables will be provi ded based on the most 
intense event during the analysis period -independent of relationship to study  medicat ion.  
Similarly, where a subject has multiple adverse events within the level of summarizati on in a 
single analysis period, the subject will only be counted once at that l evel of  summarizat ion in the 
adverse event frequency  tables

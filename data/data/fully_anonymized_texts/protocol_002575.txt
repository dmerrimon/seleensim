[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
February [ADDRESS_805019]  
Objectives:  Prolonged Exposure therapy (PE) is a first -line treatment for posttra umatic stress 
disorder  (PTSD) ; however  few VA patients receive this treatment. One of the barriers to PE 
receipt  is that this treatment is only available in an individual (one -on-one) format , whereas 
many VA mental health clinics provide the majority of their psycho therapy services in group 
format. In particular, VA PTSD residential rehabilitation programs (RRTPs) offer most 
programming in a group format. Thus, t he current study was designed to pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a group 
format of PE  in RRTP s. 
 
Research Plan:  We recruited 39  veterans who were  engaged in care  at the Battle Creek VA 
PTSD RRTP  to participate in a Group PE protocol.  
 
Methods:  Participants engage d in twelve  90-minute sessions of Group PE over the course of [ADDRESS_805020] for DSM -5 (PCL-5) and depression symptoms were 
measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9).  
 
Statistical Analysis  Plan : We measured  PTSD symptoms and depression symptoms at 
baseline, endpoint (6 weeks),  and at 2 -month follow -up.  
  
Backgroun d and Significance  
Prolonged Exposure therapy (PE) is a first -line treatment for posttraumatic stress 
disorder  with the highest level of recommendation from the VA/Do D Clinical Practice 
Guidelines .1 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_442871] , very few VA patients with PTSD receive this treatment. In 
residential PTSD programs, an average of 8% received PE in fiscal year 2012 (range 0–67%) .2  
One of the barriers to PE receipt is that PE is only available in an individual (one -on-one) 
format, whereas many VA mental health clinics provide the majority of their psychotherapy 
services in group format. In particular, PTSD residential rehabilitation programs (RRTPs) offer 
most programming in g roup format. Perhaps as a result , cognitive processing therapy  (CPT), a 
comparable trauma -focused treatment that is available in a group format, is provided  [ADDRESS_805021] 
the feasibility of conducting this treatment in residential treatment participants.  
 
Research Design and Methods  
Sample . Thirty -nine veterans who were receiving treatment in the PTSD RRTP at the Battle 
Creek VA were  recruited to participate in a Group PE protocol. It should be noted that N=30 was 
the median sample size per arm for trials with continuous outcome measures in a review of 79 
feasibility trials .7 Thus, a sample size of 39 provides  adequate feasibility data for a fully -powered 
randomized controlled  trial to be performed at the conclusion of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].   
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria . Inclusion and exclusion criteria were  minimized and include d 
only those factors that prevent ed the Veteran from benefiting from the current program. 
Inclusion criteria were  current RRTP enrollment. Exclusion criteria were  level of suicidal risk or 
severe cognitive impairment that in the judgment of the investigator  made it unlikely that the 
patient could  adhere to the study regimen. Eligible participants were  offered participat ion in the 
study and those who agree d to participate review ed consent forms with study staff.  
Goals and objectives.  Consistent with recommen dations for feasibility studies ,8,9 the objectives 
of this study were to determine feasibility and acceptability  of the intervention . We measured 
PTSD symptoms (PCL -5) and depression symptoms (PHQ -9) at baseline, endpoint (6 weeks), 
and at 2-month follow -up. 
 
Location of resources.  The treatment was provided by [CONTACT_607536].  
 
Staff training.  Staff were  trained in -person and through the provision of a treatment manual. All 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_607529]. In addition to this training, Co -
Investigator Erin Smith provide d an in -person  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_607530]. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_607531] d training on handling potential crisis situations and ad verse events. 
Ongoing consultation was provided as needed.  
 
Treatment Manual.  The RRTP Group PE treatment manual  was adapted from the manual used 
in Smith et al., 2015 .4 Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_607532]. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_607533] d proficiency via role play practice prior to delivering sessions to study 
participants.  
Treatment implementation and monitoring . Protocol adherence and participant -rated 
acceptability were  monitored during the treatment.  All group sessions were  audiotaped for the 
purposes of fidelity monitoring. 25% of tapes were  randomly selected and coded by [CONTACT_607537] a dherence and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136338]. Participant safety was 
continuously monitored. Participation in the study was discontinued if a participant experience d 
intolerable exacerbation of PTSD.  
 
Procedure.  Partic ipants engage d in twelve [ADDRESS_805022] ed of psychoeducation, rationale for treatment, and in vivo exposure 
to reduce trauma -related avoidance and thereby [CONTACT_607538].  
 
Participant process/feedback  measures . Participants were administered the PCL -[ADDRESS_805023] (PCL -5) – a 20-
item self -report measure .[ADDRESS_805024] deviations for 
primary outcome (P CL-5) and secondary outcome (PHQ -9) at baseline , endpoint , and [ADDRESS_805025] the effectiveness of this treatment .

Page 1 of 16Protocol Title: The Microbiome of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) Tunneling 
Wounds
Protocol Number: 20201035
Protocol Version #: 1.2
Protocol Version date: 05May2022
Principle Investigator Name: [CONTACT_467584]-Tov, MD
Study ID: [REMOVED]
1)Objectives*
Our overall hypothesis is that tunneling wound (TW) formation is key in disease 
progression from local skin disease to systemic inflammatory disease. Further we 
hypothesize that biofilms present in the TW are detrimental to healing and allow 
propagation of the disease process. Our specific hypotheses for this project are:
H1: Biofilms exist in HS TW, as determined by [CONTACT_467570] 
H2: antibiofilm treatment can resolve biofilms in HS TW, as determined by 
[CONTACT_467571], histology, or inflammatory and 
antimicrobial tissue response by [CONTACT_467572]
H3: treatment of the biofilms in TW modulates the systemic host response.
2)Background*
Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a devastating chronic skin disease affecting 
approximately 1% of the population. Currently, there is no cure for HS. Standard 
care includes combination of medical and surgical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. There is only one 
agent tested in RCT which provides moderate relief to about half of the patients. As 
part of disease progression, dermal and subcutaneous tunneling wounds (TW) that 
communicate with the skin’s surface form and are colonized with bacteria.[ADDRESS_599255] 
reported our anecdotal success with treatment of HS TW with antibiofilm surfactant 
wound gel (ABWG,) (in submission) and we aim to prospectively examine the 
mechanisms involved. 
3)Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*
Inclusion criteria
1. Adults [ADDRESS_599256]
-       Study #: 20201035        Effective Date: 5/5/[ADDRESS_599257] 2 CM in length
4. Able to provide informed consent
Exclusion criteria:
1. Individuals who are not yet adults
2. Women known to be pregnant 
3. Prisoners
4. Subjects, who in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], cannot comply 
with home application of the treatment. 
4)Number of Subjects*
We intend to recruit 15 subjects.
5)Study-Wide Recruitment Methods*
Patients with HS seen for their routine care at the Dermatology Outpatient 
Clinics at the University of Miami Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], South Miami satellite site, or 
Lennar Medical Foundation satellite site will be identified for possible 
study eligibility by [CONTACT_467573]. If the treating 
dermatologist is a study team member, they will ask the potential subject 
if they would be interested in being contact[CONTACT_467574] a research study for HS. A partial HIPAA waiver is needed, so 
that if the patient gives permission to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], they will then be 
approached by a member of the study team while they are in clinic or if 
that is not feasible then the treating dermatologist will ask if the patient 
would like to be contact[CONTACT_5143]. If the treating dermatologist is 
not a study team member, they will ask the potential subject to contact [CONTACT_467575]’s contact 
[CONTACT_32431]/or the study flyer. If the potential subject agrees to be 
contact[CONTACT_38435], the treating physician will ask the patient to 
sign a PHI release authorization form, so that the physician can provide 
the study team the patient’s contact [CONTACT_3031]. If it is then determined 
that they are interested in participating, they will be scheduled for a visit 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_467552]. 
The risks/benefits of the study will be presented to the subjects, as well as 
the disclaimer that refusal to participate in the study will in no way, shape, 
or form alter the type or quality of their care. 
A partial HIPAA waiver is also needed as patients diagnosed with HS who 
signed the University of Miami’s Consent to Contact [CONTACT_467576]. Each 
of those individuals with then be contact[CONTACT_467577] a study team 
member and asked if they would be interested in learning more about a 
research study on HS. If it is then determined that they are interested in 
participating, they will be scheduled for a visit with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_467553] 
-       Study #: 20201035        Effective Date: 5/5/[ADDRESS_599258]. The risks/benefits 
of the study will be presented to the subjects, as well as the disclaimer that 
refusal to participate in the study will in no way, shape, or form alter the 
type or quality of their care.
6)Study Timelines*
We intend to enroll subjects over a one-year period from the date of IRB 
approval. Each subject will participate in the study for a total of 4 weeks 
(28 days +/- 3). Each subject will be invited for 3 visits: initial visit, 
follow up visit and final visit. 
7)Study Endpoints*
The primary endpoint of the study is the change in microbiome from HS 
TW before and after 4 weeks treatment with the ABWG as measured by 
[CONTACT_7408] 16s rDNA PCR for bacterial enumeration. 
Secondary outcomes include: Change in lesion severity (as measured by 
[CONTACT_156889]-PGA (Table 1) and Hurley Stage (Table 2)), change in pain from 
baseline (as measured by a 100 mm visual analogue scale), change from 
baseline in HS lesion erythema as measured by [CONTACT_467578] (CEA) scale (Table 5), change from baseline in exudate 
graded from none to leaking (see Table 4), changes from baseline in range 
of motion as measured by a goniometer in the following directions: 
flexion, extension, abduction, internal and external rotation (Table 6), 
change in quantity and type of pain medication use, weekly change in 
number days of work/school lost, number of dressing used per week, 
Quality of life (using HiSQOL and DLQI).
Other descriptive measures included:
Microbiome assessment from the tissue using metagenome shotgun sequencing 
approach to identify all species and their corresponding virulence factors, 
including genes responsible for biofilm formation antibiotic resistance genes, etc.
Tissue assessment by [CONTACT_27183]
Inflammatory and antimicrobial tissue response by [CONTACT_467579].
Confocal laser scanning microscopy to visualize and confirm biofilm before and 
after treatment will be performed on a small subset of subjects (about 5)
Change from baseline in serum levels of markers of inflammation such as IL-6, 
IL-8, IL-10, IL-17α, soluble TNF receptor II (sTNF-RII), C-reactive protein 
(CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

-       Study #: 20201035        Effective Date: 5/5/[ADDRESS_599261] swab of the lesion will be performed 
and placed in a collection tube labeled with the patient number, date and “pre.” 
The area will be cleaned, then anesthetized using local anesthesia. Once the area 
is properly anesthetized, a punch incision will be made and the tissue placed in a 
sterile petri dish lined with gauze labeled with the patient number, date and 1. 
After the tissue is place in the dish, sterile PBS will be added to the gauze.
 A probe will then be inserted into the tunnel to identify the terminal end. 
A second punch incision will be made at the end of the tunnel and the tissue will 
be collected in a second sterile petri dish labeled with the patient number, date 
and 2.  Hemostasis will be achieved. Once hemostasis is achieved, a second 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_467554]. The ABWG (BlastX, NextScience, 
Jacksonville, FL) will then be applied to both punch sites using a tongue 
depressor. Absorbent dressing will be applied to cover the wound.
 In the days between visits, patients will apply one fingertip unit of the 
ABWG to the study wound daily.
In order to correlate the change in microbiome to secondary clinical 
outcomes, at each visit a focused physical exam will be performed. The 
corresponding HS-PGA (Table 1) and Hurley Stage (Table 2) will be calculated.  
The HS lesion locations will be marked on a HS Lesion Body Map (Table 3) and 
will also be photographed using standard photography.
 At each visit, the subject’s pain on a 100mm visual analog scale, amount of pain 
medication used, number of dressings used, quality of life, and number of work/school 
days lost will also be quantified. Wound site exudate will be graded based on the Table 4 
below. HS lesion erythema will be graded on the Clinical Erythema Assessment (CEA) 
scale (Table 5) at each visit. Active range of motion in degrees of the nearby [CONTACT_467580] 
(shoulder or hip) will be observed and recorded using a goniometer in the following 
directions: flexion, extension, abduction, internal and external rotation (Table 6). During 
the first and last visit quality of life will be assessed utilizing the Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (DLQI) and the HS Quality of Life Questioner (HiSQOL).  The DLQI 
questionnaire is designed for use in adult participants with inflammatory skin
diseases and has been used in HS studies. The DLQI surveys participants about
symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships 
and treatment. The DLQI total score ranges 0 -30 (lower scores indicating higher health
related QOL). A total score of [ADDRESS_599262]’s QOL. The HiSQOL questionnaire is comprised of 17 
items and has a recall period of 7 days. The HiSQOL includes 3 subscales: symptom 
status, psychosocial impact, and impact on physical activities. It has been recently 
validated and is HS  disease specific.

Page 9 of 169)Data and Specimen Banking*
Study records including informed consents and source documents will be stored in a 
locked cabinet in the Dermatology Clinical Trials Unit at University of Miami 
(University of Miami Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_467556], [ADDRESS_599265], Suites 504-508, 
[ZIP_CODE]).
Collected samples will be assigned numeric identifiers (subject ID, visit and date of 
collection).  Specimens will be banked for future use and kept under 
lock in the Pastar laboratory ([ADDRESS_599266], RMSB 6056, Miami FL 
[ZIP_CODE]). All specimens will be stored at -80°C in the laboratory ([ADDRESS_599267], RMSB 6056, Miami FL [ZIP_CODE]). 
10)Data and Specimen Management
Data collected will be analyzed by [CONTACT_464]. All study data will be saved 
on UM computers that are password protected. After initial data collection, 
all data analyses will be conducted in aggregates and will be de-identified. 
11)Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*
This study involves procedures that are within the standard care spectrum 
for HS. However, the safety of subjects is the primary objective of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_105092]. All subjects will be evaluated for adverse events 
routinely at every study visit. PI [INVESTIGATOR_467557]. Subjects will also be provided with contact 
[CONTACT_467582] [INVESTIGATOR_467558]. Since this is small, unblinded study, a data 
monitoring committee is not required. Data recorded in the subject’s CRF 
will be reviewed for specific adverse event including: pain, fever, chills, 
bleeding, burning or discomfort from product application. Since all 
procedures conducted are within the scope of standard care, we do not 
expect significant adverse events above and beyond the usual events 
associated with minimally invasive surgical procedure (i.e. incision and 
drainage). However, if a subject dies or experiences admission to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_467559], the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_467560]. 
12) Adverse events 
Collecting Adverse Events 
Study staff and PI [INVESTIGATOR_467561], recording and reporting any adverse 
event during the study period. In addition to unsolicited reports by [CONTACT_1766], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_467562]. 
Definition of an adverse event 
In this study an adverse event (AE) will be defined based on FDA CFR Title 21: 
“Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related” [28]. Therefore an AE is 
considered as any unplanned medical occurrence that affects subject’s health and/or well-
-       Study #: 20201035        Effective Date: 5/5/2022
Page 10 of 16being. The adverse event need not be directly related to the study device or procedure. As 
such, an adverse event may include any unintended outcome such as a symptom or a new 
diagnosis or worsening or improvement of existing medical condition. 
Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined according to FDA CFR title 21: “Serious adverse 
event or serious suspected adverse reaction. An adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89401], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse”. 
A SAE is therefore an AE that: 
1. Results in death. 
2. Is life-threatening at the time of the AE. 
3. Results in an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]. 
4. Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6. May require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above. 
Documenting and reporting adverse events 
All adverse events need to be recorded and reported to the local IRB and the sponsor in a 
timely manner and in accordance to local regulations. 
Assessment of advance event causality 
For each AE the PI [INVESTIGATOR_467563]. The 
relationship of AE to study activities will be recorded in the AE log. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_467564]: 
Probable: the AE appears to follow a temporal sequence following study related 
activities, or has a dose relationship with study activities (i.e. worse when activity 
increased and visa versa) and cannot be attributed to other causes such as past medical 
history. 
Possible: the AE appears to follow a temporal sequence following study related activities, 
or has a dose relationship with study activities (i.e. worse when activity increased and 
visa versa) but could be attributed to other causes such as past medical history and other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
-       Study #: 20201035        Effective Date: 5/5/2022
Page 11 of 16Unlikely: the AE does not appears to follow a temporal sequence following study related 
activities, and does not demonstrate a dose relationship with study activities (i.e. worse 
when activity increased and visa versa) and could reasonably be attributed to other causes 
such as past medical history and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Cannot assess: the PI [INVESTIGATOR_467565]/or contradictory or unreliable information. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_467566]-evaluate the AE in order to classify it into one of the classes above.
13)Withdrawal of Subjects
Although unlikely, a subject may withdraw from the study at any time at their own 
request. Subjects may also be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_467567], behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. 
At the time of discontinuing from the study, visit [ADDRESS_599268] withdraws from the study and 
also withdraws consent (see below) for disclosure of future information, no further 
evaluations will be performed, and no additional data will be collected. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_467568]. If a 
subject withdraws from the study due a SAE, the SAE will be recorded in the CRF 
and reported to the IRB. Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early 
termination procedures will not be viewed as protocol deviations so long as the 
participant’s safety was preserved. 
Withdrawal of Consent: 
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment will remain in the 
study and must continue to be followed per protocol. The only exception to this will 
be when a subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact. Subjects 
should notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_467569]-
up and this will be recorded in the CRF. The withdrawal of consent should be 
explained in detail in the CRF, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further 
receipt of treatments or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study 
follow-up. 
14)Risks to Subjects*
The procedures involved in the study are within the standard care for 
people with HS and are indicated. Therefore, the main added risk we 
anticipate is unintentional reveal of PHI. 
Additional risks that are inherent in the standard care treatment include: 
pain, bleeding, infection and abnormal scarring that are related to the 
surgical procedures. There are minimal risks associated with the FDA 
cleared ABWG that include stinging or burning at the application site. 
15)Potential Benefits to Subjects*
Regardless of the research outcomes, the patients will benefit from 
immediate symptom relief. They will also have better healing of the 
lesions. They may also experience no recurrence in the areas treated. If our 
hypothesis is correct, they will be spared worsening of disease. Given the 
poor overall management of HS nationwide, patients will benefit from 
-       Study #: 20201035        Effective Date: 5/5/[ADDRESS_599269] access to free 
dressing and wound care for the duration of the study which are 
infrequently covered for HS. 
16)Vulnerable Populations*
This research study does not include vulnerable populations. Specifically, 
we will not enroll minors, pregnant women, prisoners, or cognitively 
impaired people.  
17)Multi-Site Research*
This is a single site study.
18)Community-Based Participatory Research*
This study was designed without CBPR.
19)Sharing of Results with Subjects*
There are no results to share with the subjects.
20)Setting
Clinical study activities will take place in the Dermatology Clinical Trials Unit at 
University of Miami (University of Miami Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_467556], [ADDRESS_599270], Suites 504-507, [ZIP_CODE]) and the Dermatology clinic at UMH ([ADDRESS_599271] 
suite K/L/M, Miami, FL [ZIP_CODE]).
Laboratory analysis activities will take place in the Pastar laboratory ([ADDRESS_599272], RMSB 6056, Miami FL [ZIP_CODE]). All specimens will be stored at -
80°C in the laboratory ([ADDRESS_599273], RMSB 6056, Miami FL [ZIP_CODE]). 
This study is open to all eligible subjects. Recruitment efforts will focus on the 
existing dermatology clinics with the University of Miami Health System as well as 
other specialty clinics at UMHS where HS subjects may visit such as general 
surgery, plastic surgery and gynecology.

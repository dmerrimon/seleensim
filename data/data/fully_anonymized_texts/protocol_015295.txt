STUDY DESIGN  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, plac ebo-controlled 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV CR845 at a dose of 
0.5 mcg/kg administered after each dialysis session.  The study 
includes a Double-blind Phase and an Open-label Extension Phase . 
Double-blind Phase  
The Double-
blind Phase of the study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 
7-day Run-in P
eriod, a 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period, and a 
2-week Discontinuation Period.  Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study- specific procedures.  The Screening Visit 
will occur within [ADDRESS_989695] 
dialysis session of that week (ie, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for patients 
on a Tuesday -Thursday- Saturday dialysis schedule).  The purpose of 
the Run- in Period is to confirm that each patient has 
moder ate-to-severe pruritus (ie, weekly average worst itch score >4), as

 of their Worst Itching Intensity NRS daily score.  For 
consistency, patients will be requested to complete the NRS worksheets (either at home or in the dialysis unit, as required) each day 
at a similar time of day around the normal start time of their dialysis . 
Patients will be trained on other itch- related pati
 ent-reported outcome 
(PRO) worksheets during the Run-in Period or on Day 1 of the Double-blind Treatment Period. 
If patients continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at the 
end of the 7-day
 Run-in Period, they will be randomized into the 
Double-blind Treatment Period in a 1:1 ratio to receive either IV CR845 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo.  P atients will be stratified according to 
their use or non-use of concomitant medications to treat their itch 
during the week prior to randomization (Run- in Period) as well as the 
presence or absence of specific medical conditions.  These specific 
medical co nditi 
ons include:  
• History of fall or fracture (related to fall)  
• Confusional state or mental status change or altered mental 
status or d
isorientation  
• Gait disturbance or movement disorder 
Day [ADDRESS_989698] treatment week (ie, Monday for 
patients on a Monday -Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule, or Tuesday 
for patients on a Tuesday -Thursday-Saturday dial ysis schedule).  
Patients will be administered CR845 or matched placebo as an IV bolus after the end of each dialysis session during the 12- week 
Double- blind Treatment Period.  Each patient is to receive CR845 or 
placebo [ADDRESS_989699] Itching Intensity NRS score over the previous 
24 hours.  In addition, during selected study visits (Day [ADDRESS_989700] day 
of Weeks 5, 9, 11, and 13; ie Days 29, 57, 71, and 85), they will 
complete other PRO measures (Skindex-10 Scale, 5- D Itch Scal e, and 
Patient Global Impression of Change ).  Patients will be instructed to 
record pati
ent-reported outcome measurements at a similar time of day, 
whether in t he dialysis unit (on di alysis days) or at home 
(on non- dialysis days).  
Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected at the Screening Visit, Days 1 and 85.  Blood samples for biomarkers will be 
collected at Days 1 and 85.  Electrocardiogram s (ECGs) will be

 monitored at the Screening Visit and Day 85.  Vital signs will be 
monitored periodically, and adverse events and concomitant 
medications will be continuously recorded starting at the Screening 
Visit  until the end of the Discontinuation Period or Early Termination 
Visit .  Use of antipruritic medications, iron, and 
erythropoie
sis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and missed dialysis will be 
recorded throughout the Double -blind Phase. 
The Double-blind Treatment Period will be followed by a 2- week 
Discontinua
tion Period, during which no study drug will be 
administered.  Patients will be monitored and evaluated for potential 
physical dependence by [CONTACT_12550] a Short Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] 
(ShOWS) daily on dialysis days and on non- dialysis days.  Objecti ve 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] (OOWS) score, adverse events, concomitant medication, body temperature, and vital signs measurements will also 
be collected at each dialysis visit.  During this period, patients will continue to report their NRS scores but only on the dialysis visit.  
A Structured Safety Evaluation will b e perform
 ed once during the 
Run-in Period and weekly (preferably on Wednesday/Thursday) during 
the Double-blind Treatment Period and Discontinuation Period.  The 
Structured Safety Evaluation is performed by [CONTACT_129179] a list of specific signs/symptoms (eg, mental status change, falls, gait disturbance). 
Open -label Extension Phase  
Patients wh
o received at least 30 doses of study drug (either active or 
placebo) during
 the 12-week Double- blind Treatment Period and 
continue to meet other eligibility criteria will have the option to receive 
open-label CR845 for an additional 52 weeks.  The Open- label 
Extension Phase will be comprised of the Open- label Treatment Period 
and the Follow-up Period.  
Each patient will receive CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg after each 
dialysis s
ession, 3 times per week for up to 52 weeks, regardless of 
whether they had been previously administered placebo or CR845.  
Prescription dry weight will be recorded every 12 weeks ; if there is a 
>10% change from the previous recorded dry weight, then the CR845 dose will be adjusted.  
The first visit and first dosing for the Open -label Extensi
 on Phase of 
the study will occur during the week (+1 -week window) following the 
Discontinuation Period. 
Patients will complete the 5 -D Itch Sc ale during Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 
36, and 52 (preferably at the end of the specified weeks).  
Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, adverse events, and concomitant 
medications will be monitored throughout t he Open -label Treatment 
Period.  Blood samples for inflammatory biomarkers will be collected periodically until the Open-label End-of- Treatment or Early 
Termination Visit.  ECGs will be mon itored at the Open -label 
End-of-Treatment or Early Termination Visi t.

Treatment Period.  
 
Additional efficacy endpoints are described in Section 8.7.4. 
Safety Endpoints 
The safety endpoints used to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability 
of CR845 will be adverse events, ECG, vital signs, and clinical safety 
laboratory evaluations.  
INTERIM 
ASSESSMENT (Double-blind Phase) Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_1052] a 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The operation of the DSMB 
will be governed by a charter that will describe the group’s meeting 
frequency, procedures, and requirements for reporting its observations 
to the Sponsor. 
A single interim assessment for sample size re- estimati on is planned 
after approximately 50% of the first 350 randomized patients eithe r 
complete the 12 -week Double -blind Treatment Period or discontinue 
study drug prematurely.  The interim assessment will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_223233] (IDMC).  Members of the 
IDMC will not participate in the DSMB and will not be members of the 
study team.  During the interim assessment, the study team will remain 
blinded to the data; however, the IDMC will receive unblinded 
summary results to implement the decision rule for sample size re-estimation. The IDMC will only communicate  the decision to either 
keep the original sample size or to increase it; no other results will be provided to blinded staff.   The DSMB will be made aware of the 
decision, but not given the results that were the basis of the decision.  
 
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSI S Analysis Populations  
The Enrolled Population is defined as the group of patients who sign informed consent. 
The ITT Population is defined as the group of patients who are 
randomized to a
 treatment group. The Double-blind Safety Population 
is defined as the group of randomized patients who received at least 1 
dose of study drug during the Double- blind Treatment Period.  
Following the intent -to-treat principle, patients in the ITT will be 
analyzed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the 
actual treatment received.  Patients in the Double- blind Safety Analysis 
Population will be analyzed according to the actual treatment received.  
The Double-blind Safety Population will be used to analyze all safety 
endpoints collected during the Double-blind Phase, while the ITT 
Population will be used to analyze all efficacy endpoints collected 
during the Double-blind Phase.

addition to change from baseline. 
 
Efficacy Analyses (Double -blind Treatment Period)  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT Population.  An 
analysis of t
he primary and secondary efficacy variables for the Per -
Protocol Population will also be performed. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The prima ry efficacy endpoint is defined as the proportion o f patients 
achieving at l
east a [ADDRESS_989704] Itching Intensity NRS 
score at Week 12 (Days 79 -85) of the D ouble- blind Treatment Period.  
The weekly mean of the [ADDRESS_989705] Itching Intensity NRS 
score reported during a specific week during the Double-blind 
Treatment Period (eg,  Days 2 to 8, Days 9 to 15, Days 16 to 22, etc,. 
Days 79 to 85) divided by [CONTACT_273575]- missing scores 
for that week.  If the daily worst itching score is missing for >[ADDRESS_989706] Itching Intensity NRS scores 
collected over the Run-in Period, including pre-randomization 
assessments collected on Day  1.  
In the primary efficacy analysis, missing NRS data will be imputed 
using a multiple imputation (MI) approach, assuming that patients who 
discontinue double -blind treatment early would have similar Worst

Page [ADDRESS_989707] complete data:  
• Intermittent missing NRS scores will first be imputed using the 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented with the SAS MI procedure, which is appropriate for non-monotonic 
missing data.  
• NRS scores missing after patients discontinue study drug early will 
then be mult
iply imputed with the SAS MI procedure using a 
method appropriate for monotone missingness (eg, regression 
statement).  
• The proportion of patients who have an improvement from 
baseline wi
th respect to the weekly mean of the daily [ADDRESS_989708] Itching Intensity NRS score ≥ 3 points will be calculated for 
each imputed dataset. Differences between CR845 0.5 mcg/kg and 
placebo with respect to the primary endpoint will be compared using a logistic regression model containing terms for treatment 
group, baseline NRS score, use of prior anti-itch medication, and 
presence of specific medical conditions 
• Results of the logistic regression on the multi
 ply imputed data sets 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_273576].   
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted to evaluate t
he robustness of study results under different assumptions 
and imputation algorithms (Section 8.7.1). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The Skindex- 10 Scale t
 otal score and the 5 -D Itch Scale total score will 
be analyzed using a mixed effects model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) that will contain treatment, week, and treatment-by- week 
interaction as fixed effects; baseline score, prior anti -itch medication 
usage and presence of specific medical conditions as covariates; and patient as a random effect.  Repeated measures will include values 
collected at the end of Weeks 4, 8, 10, and 12 (end of treatment).  The 
mean treatment difference between CR845 0.5 mcg/kg and placebo 
will be estimated as the simple contrast in the treatment effect at 
Double- blind Treatment Period Week 12. 
It is important to note that, in HD patients, the study drug administered 
during th
e last dialysis of a particular week is not cleared until the first 
dialysis of the next week. Therefore, measurements that would reflect treatment effect at the end of a specific week (eg. Week 4) will actually 
be collected during the first day of the next week (eg. Week 5).

  Period w ill be analyzed follow a similar mehtodology to the one 
employed in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint.   
Hypothesis Testing Strategy 
Testing of the primary efficacy endpoint will be 2-sided and conducted 
at the 5% er
ror level.  The study will be considered positive if the null 
hypothesis of no treatment difference in the primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with a ≥3-point 
improvement from baseline at Week [ADDRESS_989710] Itching Intensity NRS) is rejected in

testing of the secondary variables will be reported, they will only be considered inferential if the primary analysis is statistically significant.  
Testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed 
sequentially at a 2 -sided 5% error level.  The difference between

 The proportion of patients achieving ≥4-point 
improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS at Week 12 of the Double-

21 December 2017   Version 1.0 
 
 4.0 Introduction  
4.1 Background and Rationale 
CR845 is a kappa-opi[INVESTIGATOR_9736] (KOR) agonist with a peripheral mechanism of action 
being develope
d by [CONTACT_273577], Inc. (designated as Cara Therapeutics or Sponsor 
in this protocol) as a novel therapeutic agent for the symptomatic relief of acute and 
chronic pain and pruritus. 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_273556] 
3 subtypes:  mu, ka
ppa, and delta.  These receptor subtypes are found in the central 
nervous system (CNS), in peripheral nervous system tissues, such as skin and viscer a, 
and in the immune system (see Investigator’s Brochure  for references and further details).  
CR845 was designed to activate KORs located primarily in the peripheral nervous system, which are known to modulate itch, pain, and inflammatory signals, without 
producing the side effects associated with the activation of mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], such as 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], abuse liability, and constipation. 
CR845 is a potent and selective KOR agonist with no activity at mu- and delta-opi[INVESTIGATOR_264574] o
r other re ceptors, ion channels, or transporters.  CR845’s unique peptidic 
structure significantly differs from other small molecule KOR agonists developed to date, 
which, for the most part, are CNS-active.  Being a hydrophilic peptide, CR845 has 
limited membrane permeability by [CONTACT_274775], which limits its access to the CNS.  
Since CR845 does not activate receptors other than KORs and does not readily enter the CNS, it is expected to be safer and better tolerated than other opi[INVESTIGATOR_74453], including kappa agonists. 
Uremic pruritus is a chronic, unremitting, and highly bothersome condition in patients 
with chronic ki
dney disease that adversely affects sleep, mood, and ability to socialize 
[Kumagai 2010].  Patients with uremic pruritus frequently exhibit considerable 
mechanical skin damage because of continuous scratching with excoriations, superimposed infections, and chronic lesions of prurigo nodularis or skin lichenification 
often occurring.  The mechanical skin damage can become an additional source of 
itching.  Consequently, these patients are at increased risk of related morbidities 
associated with infection, eg, cellulitis, sepsis, bacteremia, cutaneous infections, and 
infections of the dialysis access, and are at higher mortality risk (>15%) 
[Pi[INVESTIGATOR_144786]  2006; Narita 2006].  Large multinational studies (Dialysis Outcomes and Practice 
Patterns) and studies based in the [LOCATION_002] have demonstrated that approximately 
30 to 40% of hemodialysis patients have moderate- to-severe pruritus.  There are no 
approved treatments for this condition in the [LOCATION_002] and current off- label therapi[INVESTIGATOR_273559].  
Although the pathophysiology of moderate- to-severe pruritus in hemodialysis patients is 
not well understood, there is incre asing evidence that it is likely multifactorial and that an 
immune system dysfunction (including elevated proinflammatory activity) and imbalance

 in the endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_59791] (with over-expression of mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_725139] ) are involved 
[Kimmel 2006; Narita 2006; Phan 2012; Patel 2007; Mettang 2002; Tey 2011].  
Based on nonclinical pharmacological studies, it was anticipated that CR845 will produce 
a combined anti-itch, and anti- inflamma tory effect (see Investigator’s Brochure  for 
details), which could provide significant relief of itch in hemodialysis patients.   
In nonclinical studies, CR845 has been shown to exhibit antipruritic and 
anti-inflammator
y properties [ Investigator’s Brochure ].  Thus, CR845 is intended to 
reduce the severity of itching in hemodialysis patients and thereby [CONTACT_725156][INVESTIGATOR_273561]. 
4.2 Clinical E xperience 
4.2.1 Overall Expos ure 
As of the writing o f this protocol , the intravenous (IV) formulation of CR845 has been 
evaluated in 722 patients and healthy volunteers across eight Phase 1 studies (including 
2 studies conducted in Japan), three Phase 2 studies for the relief of moderate- to-severe, 
acute po stoperative pain, and two Phase 2 studies for the relief of moderate- to-severe 
pruritus in hemodialysis patients.  In the [LOCATION_002], CR845 has been evaluated both as an IV bolus and a 15-minute infusion of single or repeated doses ranging from 0.5 to  40 mcg/kg.  
Of the patients exposed to IV CR845 to date, 213 hemodialysis patients (127 males and 86 females)
 have received single or repeated IV injections of CR845 doses (for up to 
8 weeks) ranging from 0.5 to 6 mcg/kg across two Phase [ADDRESS_989718] current information is contained in the current Investigat
 or’s Brochure . 
4.2.2 Safety in He modialysis Patients 
A review of the aggregate safety data shows that CR845 was well tolerated in hemodialysi
s patients when administered after each dialysis session for up to 8 weeks at 
IV doses ranging from 0.5 mcg/kg to 6 mcg/kg.  Although patients exposed to CR845 
reported more adverse events compared with placebo patients, most events were mild or 
moderate in nature.  Generall y mild, transient paresthesias (facial tingling) and/or 
hypoesthesias (in different anatomic locations), mostly on the first week of dosing, as 
well as headache, dizziness, and somnolence, were the most frequently reported adverse 
events associated with CR 845 administration.  Of note, side effects (eg, dysphoria and 
hallucinations) commonly associated with centrally -acting kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_273562]845.  Consistent with its lack of affinity for mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_264574] , CR
845 did not cause euphoria, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], or reduction in oxygen 
saturation.

 CR845-CLIN2101 (Part A) evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of 
repeated IV doses of CR845 compared to placebo over an 8- week treatment period in 
[ADDRESS_989719] treatment period evaluated to date in 
hemodialysis patients and no clinically important or significant safety findings related to CR845 were noted.  As expected with patients on hemodialysis, a significant number of 
the reported serious adverse events (SAEs) were considered not treatment-related, but related to the disease and/or comorbid conditions.  There were 31 (17.8%) of 174 patients 
randomized and treated in the study who had treatment-emergent SAEs.  Of the 31 S AE 
reports, 4 (9%) occurred in 45 placebo -treated patients and 27 (21%) in 
129 CR845-treated patients.  Only 1 SAE of mental status changes (moderate in severity) in a patient who received CR845 1.5 mcg/kg IV was considered by [CONTACT_273579].  However, based on the Sponsor’s medical review, an alternate etiology of urgent/emergent hypertension offers a more plausible explanation 
for the acute change in mental status.  There were 4 patient deaths (2.3%) in the study, al l 
of which were considered not related to the study drug. 
In patients with normal renal function, CR845 can cause free- water diures
 is (aquaresis) 
and increased serum sodium.  However, as would be expected in patients undergoing 
dialysis in whom there are f ew functioning nephrons, there was no evidence of aquaresis 
or significant increases in serum sodium concentrations.  There were no adverse trends in 
clinical chemistry or hematology values (drawn pre-dialysis), including, no apparent 
differences between t he placebo and CR845 groups in serum sodium.  There were no 
discernable differences between treatment groups in vital sign results.  Of particular note, 
among patients receiving CR845, there was no apparent reduction in blood pressure or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] f ollowing dosing. 
Adverse event summary tables can be found in the Investigat or’s Brochure , with further 
details of the safety profile of CR845.   
4.2.3 Efficacy of C R845 in Hemodialysis Patients with Uremic Pruritus 
The efficacy of CR845 in uremic pruritus was evaluated in two Phase 2, randomized, 
double-blind, plac
ebo-controlled studies (CR845-CLIN2005 [Part B] and 
CR845-CLIN2101 [Part A]). 
CR845-CLIN2005 (Part B) included 65 hemodialysis patients with moderate -to-severe 
uremi
c pruritus who received either IV CR845 1.0 mcg/kg (n=33) or placebo (n=32) 
3 times per week for 2 weeks, after each hemodialysis session .  CR845 significantly 
decreased itching intensity compared with placebo (p=0.016), as measured by a visual 
analog scale (VAS) and significantly improved quality of life related to itching 
(Skindex- 10 Scale) (see Investigator’s Brochure  for details).  Furthermore, 
CR845- treated patients exhibited statistically significant reductions in both daytime 
(p=0.03) and nighttime (p=0.007) worst itching scores compared with placebo, and the 
reduction in itching intensity scores was similar on dialysis and nondialysis days.  The

Page [ADDRESS_989720] week of treatment.  
CR845-CLIN2101 (Part A) evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of repeated I
V doses of CR845 compared to placebo over an 8- week treatment period in 
[ADDRESS_989721] of 3 doses of CR845 (ie, 0.5 mcg/kg, n=44; 1 mcg/kg, n=41 and 
1.5 mcg/kg, n=44) or placebo (n=45) administered at the end of each dialysis session 
(ie, 3 times/week).  The primary efficacy endpoint for Study CR845-CLIN2101 (Part A) 
was based on itch intensity measurement and defined as the change from a [ADDRESS_989722] Itching Intensity 
numerical rating scale (NRS) score.  The least squares (LS) mean (±standard error [SE]) 
treatment group difference from placebo at Week  8 across all CR845 doses 
was -1.3 (±0.41) (95% confidence interval [CI]:  -2.1 to -0.5) (p=0.002) with an average 
NRS score reduction from baseline of -3.2 (±0.22) (LS mean ±SE) and 95% CI ranging 
from -3.7 to -2.8.  Examination of the individual CR845 dose group results for the Full 
Analysis Population indicates that a substantial improvement over placebo was observed with all 3  doses.  These differences from placebo were statistically significant for the 
lower dose group of 0.5 mcg/kg (p<0.001) and the 1.5 mcg/kg group (p=0.019), with an effect size es timated as 0.82, 0.39, and 0.62 for the 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mcg/kg doses, 
respectively.  Average reduction from baseline (LS mean ± SE) ranged from -2.8 (±0.38) 
in the 1.0 mcg/kg dose group (95% CI ranging from -3.5 to -2.0) to -3.8 (±0.38) in the 
0.5 mcg/kg  dose group (95% CI ranging from -4.5 to -3.1).   
4.2.[ADDRESS_989723] been 
identified i
n humans.  Consequently, total body clearance of CR845 in patients w ith 
severe renal impairment is reduced relative to healthy, matched, control patients 
(CR845-CLIN1005) such that plasma levels of CR845 remain relatively constant until 
cleared during dialysis in hemodialysis patients (CR845- CLIN1003 and 
CR845-CLIN2005 [Pa rt A]).  Half-life ranges between 26 and 34 hours in hemodialysis 
patients compared to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_273564] 2 to 3 hours in patients with normal renal function.  Thus, lower doses of CR845 can be administered at a less frequent interval in 
hemodialysis patie nts to achieve the same or higher overall exposure compared to 
individuals with normal renal function.  Based on this pharmacokinetic profile, CR845 
does not need to be administered more than 3 times a week after each hemodialysis 
session, which is convenient for this patient population and ensures treatment compliance in a population already burdened with complex medication schedules.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of repeat -dose CR845 wa
 s studied in 24 hemodialysis 
patients who received doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mcg/kg 3 times per week for 1 week 
(CR845-CLIN2005 [Part A]).  In this study, there were dose-proportional increases in

 maximum concentration and area under the curve, and minimal to no accumulation with 
repeat doses due to clearance of the drug by [CONTACT_121264] (see Investigator’s Brochure  
for details).  
4.3 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits  
During preclinical development, no specific safety findings to preclude the use of CR845 in humans were
 observed.  During early clinical development, IV CR845 wa s 
administered to healthy volunteers; patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal 
impairment, including end -stage renal disease (ESRD) and hemodialysis patients; 
recreational poly -drug users; and postsurgical patients.  The effects of CR845 have been 
shown to be in line with the underlying pharmacological mechanism of KOR activity.  Consistent with the nonclinical abuse liability studies conducted to date, the results of an 
abuse-potential study in humans indicated that CR845 appears to present a low risk for 
abuse potential in humans in comparison to currently clinically used opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Overall, tingling/numbness, dizziness, fatigue and/or drowsiness/somnolence have been 
the most comm
on adverse events.  Precaution is recommended in the operation of 
machinery for patients who experience dizziness, fatigue, and/or drowsiness/somnolence.  
This is described in the informed consent form (ICF), as appropriate, and will be 
discussed with each patient prior to initiation of the study.  In general, CR845 appeared to 
be well tolerated in both single - and repeat -dose clinical studies, which support continued 
study and development of this compound.

 6.0 Investigational Plan  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Descriptio n 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the 
safety and 
efficacy of IV CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg administered after each dialysis 
session.  The study includes a Double-blind Phase and an Open- label Extensi on Phase.  
CR845 will be evaluated relative to placebo over a 12- week Double -blind Treatment 
Period in hemodialysis patients with moderate -to-severe pruritus followed by a 2- week 
monitored Discontinuation Period.  At the end of the Discontinuation Period, patients 
who received a
t least [ADDRESS_989724] of a Screening Visit, a 7 -day Run-in 
Pe
riod, a 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period, and a 2-week Discontinuation Period.  
Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures.  The Screening Visit will occur within 7 to 28 days prior to randomization in order to assess eligibility.   The Screening Visit can be conducted during the Run -in Period at the 
discretion of the Investigator. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening Vis
 it 
During the Screening Visit, patients will sign the Informed Consent, and will be 
evaluated fo
r eligibility by [CONTACT_273580]/exclusion criteria, medical history, 
physical examination, prescription dry body weight, pre -dialysis 12- lead 
electrocardiogram, pre-dialysis vital signs, pre- dialysis hematology and serum chemistry, 
serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential, adverse events, and ESA and IV iron  doses, and prior medications.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Run-in Period  
Elig
ible patients will complete a [ADDRESS_989725] dialysis session of that week 
(ie, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday 
for patients on a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule).  The purpose of the 
Run- in Period will be to confirm that each  patient has moderate -to-severe pruritus 
(ie, weekly average score >4), as measured by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_989726] each patient’ s use 
of itch medications.   
During the first visit of the Run -in Period, pa tients will be trained on completion of the 
24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS scale and will start the reporting of their Worst 
Itching Intensity NRS daily score.  For consistency, patients will be requested to

 complete the NRS worksheets (either at home or in the dialysis unit, as required) at a 
similar time of day around the normal start time of their dialysis.   
Patients will also be trained on other itch -related patien t-reported outcome (PRO) and 
patient health assessment worksheets during the Run-in Period or on Day 1 of the Double-blind Treatment Period.  
A Structured Safety Evaluation will be performed during the Run-in Period (preferably
  
on Wednesday/Thursday).  The Structured Safety Evaluation is performed by [CONTACT_273581] a list of specific signs/symptoms (eg, mental status change, falls, gait disturbance).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Double -blind  Treatment Period  
If patie nts continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at the end of the 7- day 
Run-in Pe
riod, they will be randomized into the Double-blind Treatment Period in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either IV CR845 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo.  Patients will be stratified  
according to their use or non- use of concomitant medications to treat their itch  during the 
week prior to randomization (Run- in Period) as well as the presence or absence of 
specific medical conditions. 
Day [ADDRESS_989727] 
treatment week (ie,  Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis 
schedule or Tuesday for patients on a Tuesday- Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule).   
Patients will be administered CR845 or matched placebo as an IV bolus after the end of each dialys
is session during the 12-week Double- blind Treatment Period so that each 
patient will receive CR845 or placebo [ADDRESS_989728] Itching I
ntensity NRS score on a daily basis, covering the previous 24 hours.  In addition, 
during selected study visits, they will complete other PRO measures (Skindex -10 Scale, 
5-D Itch Scale, and Patient Global Impression of Change).  Patients will be instructed to record patient -reported outcome measurements, including Worst Itching Intensity NRS 
scores, at a similar time of day, w hether in the dialysis unit (on dialysis days) or at home 
(on non- dialysis days).  
Blood samples for inflammatory biomarkers will be collected for all randomized patients 
prior to dialy
sis on Day [ADDRESS_989729] dialysis at the End- of-Treatment Visi t for 
the Double-blind Treatment Period (Day 85). 
Clinical laboratory tests and vital signs will be monitored periodically, and adverse 
events and conc
omitant medications will be continuously recorded starting at the 
Screening Visit until the end of the Discontinuation Period or Early Termination Visit.  
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be monitored at Screening Visit and Day 85  or Early 
Termination Visit.

21 December 2017  Version 1.0 The number and reason(s) for missed dialysis as well as the use of antipruritic 
medications, iron, and erythropoiesis- stimulating agents (ESAs) will be recorded 
throughout the study. 
A Structured Safety Evaluation will be performed weekly (preferably on 
Wednesday/T

Evaluation is performed by [CONTACT_129179] a list of specific signs/symptoms (eg, mental 
status change, falls, gait disturbance).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Double -blind Dis continuation Period  
The Double-blind Treatment Period will be followed by a 2- week Discont inuation 
Period, during which no study drug will be administered and patients will be monitored 
for potential physical dependence, as follows: 
•Daily patient completion of the S hort Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433]
(ShOWS-Gossop 1990) (paper worksheet to be filled by [CONTACT_725157] a given patient) (see worksheet in Appendix 6, Section 14.6)
•Completion of an Objective Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] (OOWS) worksheet
(Handelsman 1987) by a trained observer at each dialysis visit (ie, 3 times a week) 
(see worksheet in Appendix 7, Section 14.7)  (training of observer will be  
recorded)
•Recording of adverse events, medication used, body temperature, and vital signs 
at each dialysis v isit. 
Measurements will be taken starting at the end of the Treatment Period (Day 85) and then 
at each dial
ysis visit for up to 2 weeks following study drug discontinuation until Day 98 
(Table 2).  
During this Discontinuation Period, at each dialysis visit, patients will be asked to continue to repor
t their daily Worst Itching Intensity NRS score over the previous 
[ADDRESS_989730] hour (+1 - 
hour window allowed) of dialysis so that dialysis- associated patient fatigue 
should minimally interfere with the completion of the scales.  Double-blind study drug 
treatment assignme nt will remain blinded throughout the course of the Discontinuation 
Period.  For patients who withdraw from the Double- blind Treatment Period early, every 
attempt will be made to conduct the 2 -week Discontinuation Period. 
A Structured Safety Evaluation wil l be performe d weekly (preferably on 
Wednesday/Thursday) during the Discontinuation Period.  The Structured Safety 
Evaluation is performed by [CONTACT_129179] a list of specific signs/symptoms (eg, mental status change, falls, gait disturbance).

at any time during the Run -in Period or on Day [ADDRESS_989751] adherence to the Training Manual for Patient Reported and Observer -reported Assessments . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Worst Itchi
 ng Intensity Numerical Rating Scale 
Intensity of itch will be measured using  an NRS scal e (Appendix 2, Section  14.2) on a 
worksheet on whi
ch patients will be asked to indicate the intensity of the worst itching 
they experienced over the past [ADDRESS_989752] describes it, where “0” is labeled with the anchor phrase “no itching” and “10” is 
labeled “worst itching imaginable.”  Patients will be provided with these worksheets to record their 24-hour worst itching assessment scores, both at the clinic on dialysis days and at home on nondialysis days.   
The Worst Itching Intensity NRS has been widely utilized for evaluation of chronic itch, 
including urem
ic pruritus [ Kumagai 2010; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_343824] 2006; Mathur 2010; Ständer 2013].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Skindex -10 Scale  
D
eveloped specifically for uremic pruritus, the Skindex-10 Scale (Appendix 3, 
Section  14.3) i
s an instrument for measurement of quality-of- life that corr elates with itch 
intensity [ Mathur 2010].  Patients are asked to mark 1 of 7 boxes numbered from 0 
(labeled with the anchor phras e “never bothered”) to 6 (labeled as “always bothered”) for 
each of the [ADDRESS_989753] week.  The total score is the sum of the numeric value of each 
answered question.  The total score is subdivided into 3 domain scores, which are sums of the scores of the following questions:  disease domain (questions 1 to 3), 
mood/emotional distress domain (questions 4 to 6), and social functioning domain 
(questions 7 to 10). 
[IP_ADDRESS] 5-D Itch Scale  
T
he 5-D Itch Scale was developed as a brief, multidimensional questionnaire designed to 
be useful as
 an outcome measure in clinical studies.  The 5 dimensions of itch assessed 
are degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution (Appendix 4, Section  14.4).

2 weeks.  The scale has been validated in patients with chronic pruritus, including 
hemodialysis patients and has been shown to be sensitive to changes in pruritus over time [Elman  2010].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Gl
 obal Impression of Change 
The Patient Global Impression of Change is a global PRO measure that assesses the change in itch 
(no change, improvement or worse ning) overall relative to the start of the 
study [ Dworkin 2005].  The scale has only [ADDRESS_989755] describes the change in itch  ranging from “Very Much Improved” to 
“Very Much Worse” (Appendix 5, Section 14.5).  
6.5.4 Safety Asse ssments 
During both the Double-blind and Open- label Phases , the safety assessments for each 
patient are the following:  
• Severity, seriousness, and relationship of adverse events to study drug  
• Structur

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Ev
ent s 
Definition of Adverse Event s 
An adverse ev
ent is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigat
ional patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
In this study, adverse events will be captured from the time a patient sig ns the ICF t
 o the 
Follow-up Visit and include the following: 
• Any new sign, symptom, or disease; 
• Any new
 clinically significant or symptomatic laboratory/diagnostic test 
abnormalit
y; 
• Any clinically significant worsening of laboratory/diagnostic test abnormality;

 • Any worsening (ie, clinically significant change in frequency, nature, and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition.  
A pre -existing condition is a condition that is present prior to signing the ICF for the 
study.  Pre
-existing conditions, such as illnesses, symptoms, reactions, progression of 
disease states, and other comorbidities, as well as laboratory/diagnostic test abnormalities, will be documented in the patient’s record as medical history.  
Signs and symptoms will be reported individua lly as adver
 se events (non -serious), unless 
a medical diagnosis was provided.  Medical diagnosis, whenever provided, will be reported rather than individual signs and symptoms.   
Any adverse event that satisfies any of the seriousness criteria described below will be 
reported as
 an SAE using the SAE Report Form, in addition to documenting in the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events that occurred up to [ADDRESS_989756] dose of study drug need to be documented on an SAE Report Form if they are deemed by [CONTACT_63033] “Related” to study drug.  
Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The Investigator will assess the severity (ie, intensity) of each adverse event (serious and non-serious) r
eported during the study based on his/her clinical judgment.  The sever ity 
of each adverse event will be assigned to one of the following categories:  
Mild : Transient, requires no special treatment, is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_4677], causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities  
Modera te: Introduces a level of inconvenience or concern to the patient that may 
interfere with daily activities, but usually is ameliorated by [CONTACT_273588] : Interrupts a patient’s usual daily activity and requires systemic drug 
therapy or  other treatment 
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life -thre
atening; 
NOTE:  Th
e term "life -threateni ng" in the definition of "serious" refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• Results in
 persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or

 • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting i
s appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately lif e-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize 
the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above.  These are usually considered serious. 
Severe versus Serious Adverse Event  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderat
e, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  An adverse event as well as an SAE must be assessed for severity.  An adverse event that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  “Severity” is not the same as “Serious,” which is 
based on patient outcome or reaction criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Adverse Event Causality or Relatedness to the Study Drug  
Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_725162]
 n each adverse event and assess 
its relationship, if any, to study drug.  The Investigator should consider many factors, 
including, but not limited to, temporal association of the event and date/time of study 
drug, duration of study drug, medical/biologic plausibility, pharmacology and adverse 
event profile of study drug, medical history (past medical history, underlying disease, comorbidities, intercurrent illness), concomitant medications, medical judgment, 
dechallenge, rechallenge, drug inter action, other plausible causes, etc., to determine the 
causality assessment of an event.   
The Investigator as well as the Sponsor will determine adverse event/SAE causality as ‘Related’
 or ‘Not Related’ to study drug.  Although there is no international consensus on 
how to define ‘Related’ and ‘Not Related,’ in general, an event is considered ‘Related’ if 
there is reasonable possibility that the event is related to study drug than to any other 
possible cause(s).  Conversely, an event is considered ‘Not Rel ated’ if there is reasonable 
possibility that the event is related to other factors than the study drug.  
Adverse Event Documentation and Follow- up 
All advers
e events, including observed, elicited, or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms ar
e to be recorded on the adverse event page in the patient’s eCRF from the 
time the patient signs the ICF and until the Follow -up Visit/early termination, whether or 
not judged by [CONTACT_66325].  The need to capture this information is not dependent upon whether adverse events are related to study drug.

 to be documented on an SAE Report Form if they are deemed by [CONTACT_63033] 
“Related” to study drug. 
Each adverse event is to be documented with a verbatim/reported term, start and stop date 
and time, seve
rity, causal relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, and 
outcome (resolved, resolved with sequelae, resolving, fatal, unknown).  The Investigator must review new adverse events and the outcome of ongoing adverse events frequently throughout the study.  
In addition to recording all adverse events (serious and non- serious) in
  the patient’s 
eCRF, all SAEs must also be documented on the SAE Report Form for the study. 
The Investigator will follow all adverse events until they resolve, the Investigator 
assesses
 them to be stable, or the patient’s participation in the study ends, whichever 
comes first.  In addition, the Investigator will follow all adverse events assessed as related 
to study drug that are ongoing at the time of the patient’s last visit, until they resolve or 
the Investigator assesses them as stable, even if the patient's participation in the study has 
ended.  Resolution of such events is to be documented in the patient’s record as appropriate.  
It is anticipated that some patients may undergo procedures and/or experience events that 
are common in t
he study population under investigation, independent of study therapy.  
Preplanned procedures and procedures (e g, kidney transplant, catheter replacement) or 
events that are independent of study therapy, according to the Investigator’s assessment, will be documented as specified in the Safety Management Plan.  Common procedures or events (new or ongoing) for which the Investigator cannot rule out the role of study drug 
in their evolution, either because their nature or severity is not consistent with that 
generally seen in the study population or because of other valid medical/scientific rationale, will be recorded and reported as adverse events with all the attributes required for appropriate medical assessment.  
Serious Adverse Event Notification, Documentation, and Reporting 
The Investigator will report an SAE within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  An 
SAE  Report Form
 will be completed regardless of relationship to the study drug.  The 
initial report will not be delayed in order to obtain additional information.  Any additional information will be reported as a follow-up to the initial report within 24 hour s of 
collection.  
Details for reporting and follow-up of SAEs are provided in the ISF. 
In the event of any SAE (other than death) occurring after the last dose of study drug and 
prior to the Fol
low-up Visit, the patient will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_273590].   
The Medical Monitor will review reported SAEs and may contact [CONTACT_725163].

 The Sponsor will comply with the applicable local regulatory re quirements related to 
reporting of SAEs to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while the Investigator 
and designated study personnel will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements related to reporting of SAEs to the IRB and Sponsor.   
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor t
 o send all regulatory reports to the FDA.  Adverse 
events that are serious, related to the study drug, and unexpected (per the 
Investigator’s Brochure ) will be reported to the FDA as per Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) 21  CFR  312.32 on Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting and as 
specified in the Safety Management Plan.  
For regulatory reporting purposes, the Sponsor can upgrade the Investigator’s assessment 
(eg, from not r
elated to related); however, Cara Therapeutics cannot downgrade the 
Investigator’s assessment unless the Investigator determines that a re -assessment of 
causality is necessary.  The Medical Monitor will review and comment on any upgrade made to a report.  If there is any doubt concerning the relationship between study drug 
and the event, then the relationship should be considered to be related to study drug. 
As applicable, the Sponsor will also notify other participating Investigator(s) of all IND 
Safety Re
ports to ensure prompt notification of significant new adverse events or risks 
with respect to study drug.  This notification will occur as soon as possible and in 
compliance with country- specific regulations.

Short Opi[INVESTIGATOR_725143] -Gossop (or ShOWS) is a self-administered scale for grading opi[INVESTIGATOR_725144] a 24-hour period.  It was  chosen because of its validation as 
an opi[INVESTIGATOR_725145] [ Gossop 1990; Bradley 1988; Vernon 2016] and frequent 
use in clinical studies.  This patient-rated scale consists of 10 items, scored from 0 (none) 
to 3 (severe) (total score range 0 –30).  This scale is demonstrated to be a valid and 
reliable indicator of the severity of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_725146] a wide range of 
common signs and symptoms.  The higher the score, the greater the severity of associated 
withdrawal.  
The ShOWS will be presented as a paper worksheet to be filled by [CONTACT_725166], at similar time of the day for a given patient  during the 2-week discontinuation period (during which no study drug 
will be administered) . 
Objective Opi[INVESTIGATOR_725147] -Handelsman contains 13 physically observable signs, rated present (score of 
1) or absent (score of 0) (total score range 0 –13), based on a timed period of 5 to 
10 minutes of observa tion of the patients by a rater [ Handelsman 1987].  Higher total 
scores will indicate more severe withdrawal signs.  The rater will be a qualified staff 
member who will be trained by [CONTACT_1034].  This scale is demonstrated to be a valid and 
reliable indic ator of the severity of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_725146] a wide range of 
common signs and symptoms.   
The OOWS will be presented as a paper worksheet to be filled by a qualified staff

 7.0 Discussion and Justification of Study Design  
7.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups  
The double-blind part of the study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
IV CR845 in hemodial
ysis patients with moderate- to-severe pruritus.  A randomized, 
double-blind design was chosen to minimize bias.  A 12-week duration of treatment was 
selected to demonstrate durability of the efficacy observed in a prior 8 -week treatment 
study (ie, Study CR845-CLIN2101) and to further evaluate safety during a longer exposure.  The primary efficacy endpoint was determined using the Worst Itching Intensity NRS scale, which measures itching int ensity over 24 hours.  This scale has been 
validated for this patient population and is identical to the primary efficacy endpoint used in the dose-ranging, Phase 2 study, CR845-CLIN2101.  The Discontinuation Period of the Double-bli
nd Phase of the study h as been designed to assess potential physical 
dependence on CR845 in accordance with the FDA abuse liability guidance [Guidance for Industry January 2017].  
The open-label part of the study was designed to evaluate the safety of CR845 
0.5 mcg/kg IV
 administered after each dialysis session (generally 3 times per week for up 
to 52 weeks) in patients who completed the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period of 
this study.  This design is commonly used in clinical development to obtain long- term 
safety information .  The duration of the study is in accordance with International Council 
for Harmonisation (ICH) and FDA guidance [ Guidance for Industry February 2016].  
7.2 Selection o f Doses in the Study  
The combined safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy data from CR845-CLIN2101 
(Part  A) provided t
he basis for the selection of the dose and dose regimen of CR845 to be 
used in this study.  The lowest dose tested (0.5 mcg/kg IV) appeared to be well tolerated 
and effective at reducing itch intensity over a period of [ADDRESS_989762] clinical, laboratory, and statistical procedures and methodology will be utilized in this study
.  The PRO assessments to be used in this study are appropriate.

categorical variables will be summarized using the frequency count and the percentage of 
patients in each category.  In addition to the descriptive summaries, pertinent data listings 
will be provided.  
All analyses will be performed using SAS® version  9.2 or higher, unless otherwise 
specified.  
8.2 Determina tion of Sample Size  
The planned sample size for this study is 350 (175 per treatment group) male and female 
hemodialysi
s patients with chronic moderate- to-severe pruritus (mean baseline [ADDRESS_989764] Itching Intensity NRS score >4), randomized at approximately 80 clinical sites.  
The sample size may be increased to 500 patients (250 per treatment group) based on the results of a planned unblinded interim assessment conducted when approximately 50% of 
the planned [ADDRESS_989765] discontinued from double-blind 
treatment early.  The planned interim assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_273594] (IDMC).  Details related to the sample size re -estimation are 
included in Section 8.4.1. 
The sample size calculation is based on results of a completed Phase 2 double-blind, 
placebo -control 
led study (CR845-CLIN2101) of CR845 in hemodialysis patients with 
ESRD who had moderate- to-severe pruritus.  In this study, 30% of patients randomized 
to the placebo group reported ≥3-point improvement from baseline with respect to the 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS at the end of treatment (Week 8).  The proportion of 
patients who received CR845 and reported a similar improvement in itch scores ranged from approximately 60% to 45% (ie, 30% to 15% difference from placebo), depending on the dose of active study drug (0.5 mcg/kg, 1.0 mcg/kg, 1.5 mcg/kg).

Chi-square will have 9 6% power to detect a treatment difference.  The power of this test 
statistic would be ≥84% for differences from placebo as low as 0.16 ( Table 4).

Based on results of a planned interim assessment, the sample size may be increased up to 500 patients (250 per treatment group).  Given this maximum sample size, and assuming 
a true response rate of 30% in the placebo group, a 2-sided continuity corrected Chi-square would have approximately 90% power to detect a treatment difference when the CR845 response rate is 45% (a 15% difference from placebo) ( Table 5).

8.3 Randomization  
Before the start of the study, a computer -generated r andomization schedule will be 
prepared.  Randomization will be performed using an IVRS/IWRS.  Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CR845 0.5 mcg/kg IV or matching placebo IV during the Double-blind Treatment Period.  Patients will be stratified according to their 
use or non- use of concomitant medications to treat their itch during the week prior to 
randomization (Run- in Period) as well as the presence or absence of specific medical  
conditions.  These medical conditions include: 
• History of f all or fractu
 re (related to fall)  
• Confusional  state or men tal status change or altered mental status or 
disorientation  
• Gait disturbance or movement disorder 
All eligible patie
nts who sign the ICF for participation in the Open- label Treatment  
Period will receive CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg starting on Day 1 of the Open- label 
Extension Phase.

8.7 Efficacy An alysis 
8.7.1 Primary Ef ficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the proportion of patients achieving ≥3-point 
improvement f
rom baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour Worst 
Itching Intensity NRS at Week  12 (Days 79 to 85) of the Double-blind Treatment Period. 
The weekly mean of the 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score will be defined as the sum of the dail
y Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores reported during a specific week 
during the Double-blind Treatment Period (eg, Days 2 to 8, Days 9 to 15, Days 16 to 22, 
Days 79 to 85) divided by [CONTACT_586102].  If 
the daily worst itching score is missing for >[ADDRESS_989772] Itching Intensity NRS 
scores collected over the Run-in Period, including pre-randomization assessments collected on Day  1.   
In the primary efficacy analysis, missing NRS data will be imputed using a multiple 
imputation (M
I) approach, assuming that patients who discontinue Double-blind 
treatment early would have similar Worst Itching Intensity NRS scores as other patients 
in their respective treatment arm that have complete data:  
• Intermittent missing NRS scores will first be imputed using the Markov Chain 
Monte Carl
o (MCMC) method implemented with the SAS MI procedure, which is 
appropriate for non-monotonic missing data.  
• NRS scores missing after patients discontinue study drug early will then be multiply i
mputed with the SAS MI procedure using a method appropriate for 
monotone missingness (eg, regression statement).  Details on the MI procedure can be found in Appendix 14.8.

 • The proportion of patients who have an improvement from baseline with respect 
to the weekly mean of the daily [ADDRESS_989773] Itching Intensity NRS score 
≥3 points will be calculated for each imputed dataset.  Differences between 
CR845 0.5 mcg/kg and placebo with respect to the primary endpoint will be compared using a logistic regression model containing terms for treatment group, baseline NRS score, use of prior anti- itch medication , and presence of specific 
medical conditions. 
• Results of the logistic regression on the multiply imputed data sets will be summariz
ed by [CONTACT_273576].    
The final p -value will b e calculated using the Cui, Hung, Wang (CHW) procedure where 
the z -score is a weighted average of the z- score at the interim and the z -score observed 
for data collected after the interim , following the formula below. 
                   Z final=Zi nterim * √(n/N) + Z post-interim * √(1 - n/N)  
where n is the number of patients at the interim and N is  the initial numb er of patients 
planned (300). 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted to evaluate the 
robustness of s
tudy results under different assumptions and imputation algorithms.  For 
each of these sensitivity analyses, the final p- value will be calculated based on the CWH 
procedure, using the formula specified above. 
• Sensitivity 1: Early discontinuations as nonresponders  
Patients who discontinue study drug early will be considered nonresponders.  The imputed data will be analyzed using a logistic regression model similar to the primary analysis.  
• Sensitivity 2:  Multiple imputation; missing not at random (MNAR)  
This sensitivity analysis is an implementation of a pattern mixture model that draws from different populations based on the reason for withdrawal.   
o Intermittent missing NRS scores will first be imputed using the MCMC 
method with the 
 SAS MI procedure, which is appropriate for non-monotonic 
missing data.  
o For patients who discontinued study drug due to adverse events, NRS scores missing afte
r discontinuation will be imputed using the distribution of the 
baseline value of all patients’ daily worst itching score assuming a trimmed 
normal (from 4 to 10).  
o For patients who discontinue due to reasons other than adverse event, missing NRS scor
es after patients discontinue study drug early will be multiply 
imputed using multiple calls of the SAS MI procedure using data from 
patients within the same treatment group that have complete data at that time.

 ficacy Endp oints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are the: 
• Change from baseline in itch -relate d quality of life at the end of Week 12 of the 
Double- blind Treatment Period, as assessed by [CONTACT_941] 5 -D Itch Scale total score ; 
• Change from baseline in itch -related qual ity of life at the end of Week  12 of the 
Double-blind Treatment Period, as assessed by [CONTACT_725172]- 10 Scale total 
core;  
• Proportion of patients achieving ≥4- point improv ement from baseline with respect 
to the w eekly mean of the daily [ADDRESS_989776] Itching Intensity NRS at Week 12  
(Day 79 to 85) of the Double-blind Treatment Period. 
The 5 -D Itch Scale and the Skindex -10 Scale scor e will be analyzed using a mixed effects 
model with
 repeated measures (MMRM).  The m odel will contain treatment, week, and 
treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects; baseline score, prior anti -itch medication 
usage and presence of specific medical conditions as covariates ; and patient as a random 
effect.  The baseline 5 -D total score and the Skindex-10 total score will be defined as the

 value collected on Day  1, prior to randomization.  Repeated measures will include values 
collected at the end of Weeks 4, 8, 10, and 12 (end of treatment).  The mean treatment 
difference between CR845 0.5 mcg/kg and placebo will be estimated as the simple contrast in the treatment effect at Double -blind Treatment Period Week 12.  
It is important to note that, in HD patients, the study drug administered during the last dialysis o
f a particular week is no t cleared until the first dialysis of the next week.  
Therefore, measurements that would reflect treatment effect at the end of a specific week (eg. Week 4) will actually be collected during the first day of the next week (eg , Week 5).
 
For the analysis of 5- D Itch Scale and the Skindex -10 Scale scor e, an appropriate 
covarian
ce matrix will be used to model the within -patient errors.  The use of an 
unstructured covariance matrix structure as well as other structures, such as spatial patterns, that require fewer parameters (Toeplitz, autoregressive, or compound symmetry) will be examined.  The Akaike information criterion will be used to determine the 
appropriate covariance matrix for the MMRM.  The Kenward -Roger approximation will 
be used to estimate the denom inator degrees of freedom.  Missing scores will not be 
imputed.  Assuming that the data are MAR, the estimates of the treatment differences 
calculated from the MMRM described above are unbiased.  
The proportion of patients achieving ≥[ADDRESS_989777] Itching Intensity NRS at Week 12 of the 
Double- blind Treatment Period will be analyzed follow ing a methodology similar to the 
one employed for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. 
8.7.3 Hypothesi s Testing Strategy  
The efficacy of CR845 0.5 mcg/kg compared to placebo in pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study 
CLIN3102 wil
l be evaluated based on 1 primary and 3 secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Testing of the primary efficacy endpoint will be 2 -sided and conduc ted at the 5% error 
level.  The study will be considered positive if the null hypothesis of no treatment 
difference in the primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint (proportion of patients 
achieving ≥ 3-point improvement from baseline with respe ct to the Worst Itching Intensity 
NRS) is rejected in favor of the alternative that patients randomized to CR845 experience significantly less itching compared to patients randomized to placebo.  
To protect the Type 1 error, a gate- keepi[INVESTIGATOR_725148].  Although the 
p-values corresponding to the hypothesis testing of the secondary variables will be 
reported, they will only be considered inferential if the primary analysis is statistically 
significant.  Testing of the 2 secondary efficacy en dpoints will be performed sequentially 
at a 2 -sided 5% error level.  The difference between CR845 0.5 mcg/kg and placebo with 
respect to th
e 5-D Itch total score will be tested first.  If results are statistically significant 
in favor of CR845, testing with respect to the Skindex- 10 total score will proceed and be 
inferential .

 8.8.2 Adverse Events  
All adverse events, as reported by [CONTACT_779],  will be coded us ing MedDRA to MedDRA 
SOC and Preferred Term for standardization and summary purposes.   
All reported adverse events (whether or not treatment -emergent)  will be included in a 
by-patient adverse event listing.   Only TEAEs will be included in summary tables which 
will present results by [CONTACT_273602], as appropriate.   Adverse events that are considered “treatment  emergent” r
 elative to the Run -in Period are 
identified as any adverse event with an onset date after the start of the Run -in Period and 
up to the first dose of study drug during the Double-blind Period. Adverse events that are considered “treatment emergent” relative to the
  Double -blind 
Period are identified as any adverse event with an onset date after the first dose of the 
double-blind study drug up to the study Double-blind End of Treatment/Early 
Termination Visit or the start of the Discontinuation Per iod (or [ADDRESS_989783] 
dose if no Double-blind End of Treatment/Early Termination Visit was conducted), whichever is later  
Adverse events that are considered “treatment -emergent” rel
 ative to the Discontinuation 
Period are identified as any ad verse event with an onset date after and up to [ADDRESS_989784] multiple 
occurrences (start and stop) of an event associated with a specific MedDRA Preferred 
Term or SOC.   The most f requent TEAEs (≥5% of patients in any treatment group) will 
also be tabulated by [CONTACT_88462].  
The incidence and percentage of patients experiencing treatment -emergent SAE s and 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation will be presented by [CONTACT_725173].   Adverse events that result in death will also be summarized.  
Treatment -emergent adv erse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_273605]-blind Phase and by [CONTACT_273606]-blind st udy drug for the 
Double-blind Period.  If the severity and/or relationship to the study drug of an adverse event is missing, a worst- case scenario will be assumed (ie, the adverse event will be 
categorized as “severe” and/or “related” to the study drug).  If a patient reports the same 
TEAE multiple times the event with the worst severity and the strongest relationship to study drug will be tabulated. 
Separate tables summarizing the incidence of AESIs, as defined in the Safety 
Surveillanc
e plan, will be presented for each study period.

 In addition, to evaluate the potential for physical dependence of CR845, a summary table 
comparing the incidence rate of TEAEs occurring prior to (i.e. during the Double-blind 
Period) and during the Discontinuation Period will be presented.  
For each period of the Double-blind Phase, an overall summary table will be provided, 
presenting
 for each treatment group:   the number and percentage of patients with an 
adverse event (both treatment and non- treatment emergent) during that p eriod, a TEAE, 
serious TEAE, related TEAE, severe TEAE, TEAE leading to dose interruption, and TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation.  This table will also include the number of 
events for each specific Preferred Term.  
All adverse events will be listed in chronological order, including patient identifier, age, 
race, gender
, a flag indicating whether the event was treatment -emergent, and all related 
event status information (start and stop dates, whether the event was ongoing, study day 
of onset, severity, seriousness, relationship to study medication, action taken with study 
treatment, and outcome).  Separate listings will be generated for SAEs, deaths, and 
adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation.  Additionally, a coding list of Preferred Terms and the verbatim text associated with them will be produced.  
8.8.3 Clinical L
 aboratory Evaluations 
Summary statistics for each scheduled time point measured and mean changes from baseline to e
ach time point (when applicable) will be presented for clinical laboratory 
results.   
All laboratory evaluation summaries will include the patients in the Double -blind Saf ety 
Population who have at least 1 postbaseline time point (for criteria based on postbaseline 
assessments) and with both a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline time point (for criteria evaluating changes from baseline).  
Laboratory values will be r eported in Sys
 tème International units.   
Laboratory test results will be assigned an L/N/H classification according to whether the 
value was bel
ow (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference range.  
Comparisons will be based on 3×3 tables (shift tables) that, for a particular laboratory 
test, compare the baseline L/N/H classification to the highest and/or lowest L/N/H 
classification during the treatment period.  Clinically important laboratory values based 
on prespecified criteria defined in the SAP will also be summarized.  
Additionally, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline 
phosphatase wi
ll be presented in a separate listing, with 3× and 5×ULN flagged for 
alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase; 2×ULN flagged for bilirubin, 
and 1.5×ULN flagged for alkaline phosphatase.  
8.8.4 Vital Signs  and ECGs

Univariate and multivariate analyses of the change in inflammatory biomarkers will be described in an analysis plan, separate from the study SAP. 
8.9.2 Missed Dial
 ysis Visits and Incidence of Infection  
The number and percentage of patients who missed 1 or more dialysis visits during the 
Double-blind Tr
eatment Period, and the total number of missed dialyses visits will be 
tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_1570].   
Incidence of infections based on adverse events, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and/or use of antibiotics 
for treatmen
t of infection related to uremic pruritus will be analyzed using Fisher’s Exact 
Test.   
8.9.3 ESA and IV Iro n 
Erythropoiesis- stimulating age nt and IV Iron use will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Statistical analyses of changes in use of ESAs or IV iron from pre-dose 
to the end of the Double-blind Treatment Period (Week 12) will be defined in the SAP. 
8.9.4 Discontinua tion Period Additional Assessments  
Baseline ShOWS and OOWS will be the scores collected on the dialysis day on Day 85 
(Double-blind 
EOT/Early Termination) ( Table 2).  Only patients who have a baseline 
ShOWS and OOW
S will be included in the analysis. 
Summary statistics for the daily ShOWs and the OOWS colle cted at each dialy sis visit, 
including number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum median of ShOWS and OOWS will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6490].  Figures for the overall mean scores over time will also be presented.  
The ShOWS scores on discontinuation days 1, 2, 3, and > 3 will be anal yzed to compare 
the treatment groups at each visit, using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model, with treatment group and baseline value as a covariate.  The OOWS scores will be analyzed using a similar ANCOVA model at each day of collection.  In addition, 
between -treatment group comparisons over the overall 2-Week Discontinuation Period 
will be performed using an MMRM with treatment group, discontinuation day, and 
treatment gr oup-by-day interaction as fixed effects, baseline value as the covariate, and 
patient as a random effect.  An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within -patient scores.  These analyses will be performed based on all 
postbaseline scores using only the observed cases without imputation of missing values.

 12.0 Administrative Procedures  
12.1 Protocol Adherence  
It is vital to the success of the study that the Investigator adhere to the details of the 
protocol, and thus t
o keep to a minimum the number of cases later classified as 
“incomplete,” “unusable,” or “not evaluable.”  If, in the interest of safety and/or 
well-being of a particular patient, it is necessary to depart from the protocol, then that 
protocol deviation will pertain to that individual patient only and will be documented.  Protocol deviations due to lack of patient compliance must also be documented.   
The site monitor will review protocol deviations throughout the course of monitoring 
visits and docum
ent new findings of deviations.  The monitor will notify the Investigators 
of deviations verbally or in writing.  The IRB should be notified of all protocol deviations 
in a timely manner according to IRB requirements. 
12.2 Publicatio n of Study Findings  
All information regarding CR845 provided by [CONTACT_725178].  By [CONTACT_438191], the Investigator 
affirms to the Sponsor that he/she will maintain, in strict confidence, information 
furnished by [CONTACT_1034], including data generated from this study and preliminary 
laboratory results, except as exempted for regulatory purposes.  All data generated during the conduct of this study are owned by [CONTACT_273577].  The Investigator agrees to use 
the information to accomplish the study and will not use it for other purposes without 
written permission from Cara Therapeutics.  Partial or full data or results from this study cannot be published without express written consent from Cara Therapeutics.  It is 
understood that there is an obligation to provide Cara Therapeutics with complete data 
obtained during the study.  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used toward the development of CR845 and may be disclosed to regulatory authority, other Investigators, corporate partners, or consultants, as required.

 15.0 Statistical Appendix  
This appendix provides further details related to the treatment of missing data for the 
primary and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint. 
For multiple imputations and other instances where random seeds are required, the values 
used (in order)
 are: 
8392857 
2985729 1843255 9086284 5547484 8017456 9597295  2252256 4821871 9852467 5126715 3232132 9841654 3645284 1587345 
Note that not all seeds may be required in programming the multiple imputations.  If 
additional s e
eds are needed, they will be chosen by [CONTACT_1583] 1 to each of the values above, 
again using them in order. 
The number of imputations for the multiple imputations will be 20.  
For the primary analysis, a multi- stage process  will be applied:  
Stage 1: Subjects will have their [ADDRESS_989795], using all visits, 
intermittent missing data will be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
method implemented with the SAS M I procedure; data imputed following subject 
discontinuation via this process will be censored out of the resulting dataset so that only 
intermittent missing data is imputed via this method.  Second, monotone missing data 
will be imputed following subject d iscontinuation using SAS proc MI.  For each stage, 
MI will be performed within treatment group with covariates for baseline NRS score, use 
of prior anti-itch medication, and presence of select medical conditions.  Should 
convergence issues occur due to small cell size for the one or both of the categorical covariates at either stage, the appropriate covariate(s) will be removed from the model.  
Stage 2:  Using the resulting complete datasets, the change from baseline with respect to 
the 11-point NRS will be calculated; patients will be categorized as responder if they have a 3-point (or greater) improvement over baseline.  Week 12 values will serve as the 
primary timepoint.  The 20 MI runs will be analyzed independently using a logistic

Page [ADDRESS_989796] medical conditions.  As with the MI, should convergence issues 
occur due to small cell sizes,  the appropriate categorical covariate(s) will be dropped as 
necessary.  
Should a sample size increase occur, the above process will be implemented completely independently a
mong subjects contributing the interim results and those following the 
interim anal ysis.  
For the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275], a shift parameter will be applied to only subjects in the active gr
oup, running from 0 to 5 points in 0.25-point increments or until the conclusions 
of the analysis “tip” and the results are no longer significant.  This analysis will not be performed should the initial primary results fail to achieve significance.

1. Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be  tested.  
Specific Aims  
• Aim 1: To evaluate receptivity and concerns of postpartum women with receiving the  HPV 
vaccine during the inpatient postpartum admission as part of the Inpatient Postpartum HPV 
Immunization Quality Improvement Program (IPP -HPV) [see  appendix].  
• Aim 2: To evaluate receptivity and concerns of healthcare providers with inpatient 
postpartum HPV immunization as part of IPP -HPV and to identify facilitators of and  barriers 
to its  implementation.  
• Aim 3: To assess the uptake and effectiveness of a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_172384] (IPP -HPV) for Yale New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (YNHH)  Women’s 
Center and Center for Women’s Health and Midwifery (CWHM) postpartum patients ≤ [ADDRESS_202021] Campus (YSC) or Saint Raphael Campus 
(SRC).  
• Aim 4: To identify t he processes utilized to integrate delivery of vaccines that are  currently 
administered routinely during inpatient postpartum  care 
• Aim 5: To iteratively develop an EMR -based tool that promotes integration of   IPP-HPV 
immunization into routine inpatient postpartum  care  
 
2. Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide 
references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific  data.  
 
Cervical cancer, the most common cancer attributable to HPV infection, is diagnosed in 
approximately 12,[ADDRESS_202022] in the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer; Black women are most 
likely to die fro m and Hispanic women are most likely to get cervical cancer. In addition, HPV 
infection causes 330,[ADDRESS_202023] medical costs in the U.S. associated with both screening for and treating HP V-associated 
diseases is estimated to be $8.0 billion dollars, over 80% of which is for routine cervical cancer 
screening and follow -up, with an additional $1 billion for cancer treatment and $[ADDRESS_202024] has a medical staff appointment and 
appropriate clinical privileges at YNHH.

be 30. 4%.1 The study also demonstrated a 24.7% reduction in the number of cervical excision 
procedures for the treatment of precancerous cervical lesions in this cohort.[ADDRESS_202026] 
shown low rates of initiation (60%) and of completion (40%) of the HP V vaccine series among 
adolescent females in the [LOCATION_002].4 Rates of initiation (30%) and of completion (13%) are even 
lower for young adult women aged 18 -26 years.5,6 Among young adult women eligible for HPV 
vaccine, pregnancy is one factor significa ntly associated with not completing the vaccine series since 
the vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy.7 
 
Rationale & Significance  
Administration  of the HPV  vaccine  during  the inpatient  postpartum  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172385] i ntervention to improve HPV immunization rates. Following onset of 
pregnancy, the postpartum period becomes the next available opportunity to immunize with the 
HPV vaccine, which is safe in breastfeeding women. The benefits of such an intervention include 
a focus on women engaged with the health care system who are often highly motivated to invest 
in their personal  health.  
 
Currently, the HPV vaccine is not routinely available to postpartum women during their inpatient 
admission. However, by [CONTACT_172419][INVESTIGATOR_307], we take advantage of access to patients and reduce the number of additional visits 
needed to complete the vaccine. Immunization of postpartum women on the inpatient floor is 
already standard practice for women who need Tdap, influenza or MMR vaccines and these 
programs are associated with increased rates of immunization.8,[ADDRESS_202027] T exas with a low rate of HPV immunization, there was a high degree of willingness to 
receive the vaccine if offered free of charge.10 One small study evaluated inpatient postpartum 
HPV immunization (IPP -HPV) in a selective patient population and, although i t was successful 
with 95% uptake of the HPV vaccine during the postpartum admission, full vaccine series 
completion was 30%.[ADDRESS_202028] not evaluated the process of clinical implementation  
of IPP-HPV  nor identified  facilitators  of or barriers  to the intervention  to improve its  effectiveness.  
Evalu ating  the implementation  process  systematically  to investigate  and address bottlenecks is 
critical for the successful promotion and integration of new approaches in the delivery of evidence -
based  practices.  
 
The purpose  of the proposed  pi[INVESTIGATOR_172386]-HPV  immunization 
at YNHH and to identify potential barriers to and facilitators of this intervention to optimize its 
feasibility and effectiveness. It is imperative that we develop innovative interventions to achieve 
compre hensive utilization of this highly effective vaccine to reduce rates of HPV infection, lower 
rates of cervical and other HPV -associated cancers, and address cancer  disparities.

1.1 Overview  
We propose a mixed methods study that will evaluate the implementation process of the 
Inpatient postpartum HPV Immunization Quality Improvement Program (IPP -HPV) using 9 - 
valent HPV vaccine for postpartum YNHH Women’s Center  patients to increase the rate of 
HPV vaccination. We will also study the effectiveness of the program to improve HPV 
vaccine series completion. The study will utilize qualitative patient and provider interviews 
as well as a medical records for data collec tion to identify facilitators of and barriers to 
successful implementation of IPP -HPV. Study of the quality improvement program may  help 
translate what has been a missed opportunity to vaccinate into a potential national model for 
a public health intervent ion that could prevent cervical  cancer.  
 
1.2 Specific Aim  1 
To evaluate receptivity and concerns of postpartum women with receiving the HPV vaccine 
during the inpatient postpartum admission as part of the Inpatient Postpartum HPV 
Immunization Quality Improvement Program (IPP -HPV).

1 .2 .1 Study participants: Patients participating in the IPP -HPV Program and fluent in 
either English or Spanish will be eligible to enroll in this qualitative  study.  
1 .2 .2 Study  design:  
Study Enrollment and Consent : After the vaccine is administered (or the patient 
declines the vaccine), a member of the research team (RA) will approach eligible 
postpartum women and invite them to participate in individual in -depth interviews. 
The RA will obtain informed consent (see attached) from women willing to 
participate. If an in -person interview prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172391], the 
RA will contact [CONTACT_172421] 2 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172392] n option to participate in a 
phone interview. In the case of a phone interview, informed consent will be sent to 
patient electronically via encrypted email, reviewed over phone and patient will 
electronically  sign and return  consent  before  proceeding  with the interview.  If patient 
is unable to sign consent electronically, they will be given option to sign it in person 
during their next postpartum encounter at the Women’s Center and then have the 
option of being interviewed before or after their clinic encou nter that day or via a 
follow up phone call. If unable to reach the patient by [CONTACT_648], we will approach the 
patient at her Women’s Center postpartum appointment after obtaining permission 
from her visit provider and invite the patient to participate in an i nterview. The RA 
will obtain consent at that time from women willing to participate. After being 
consented, he patient will have the option of being interviewed before or after their 
clinic encounter that day or via a follow up phone call. A $[ADDRESS_202031] will be 
provided as an incentive to women who  participate.  
Sampling : We will select  a purposive  sample  of postpartum  women  into two groups: 
those who receive inpatient HPV vaccine and those who decline the inpatient dose 
to interview until we reach thematic saturation which we anticipate to occur with 
about 8 -10 individuals per group. Patients will be selected to include diverse 
repres entation in age, race, ethnicity, and  parity.  
1 .2 .3 Data collection: We will conduct in -person, in -depth interviews prior to discharge 
home from the postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. If an in -person interview prior to 
discharge is not possible, we will conduct phone i nterviews or interview at the 
outpatient postpartum visit as described above. We will conduct interviews using a 
semi -structured guide (see attached) with questions based on Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) constructs. We will main tain an 
open -ended format that allows the interviewer to probe with questions as needed to 
engage participants to use their own words to express experiences. We will focus on 
CFIR constructs belonging to domains we consider to be most relevant to IPP -HPV 
implementation from the patients’ perspective: Intervention Characteristics (e.g., 
perceived advantages and adaptability of the intervention) and Characteristics of 
Individuals (e.g., knowledge and beliefs about the  intervention).  
1 .2 .4 Data  analysis:  All intervi ews will be recorded  and subsequently  transcribed.  We will 
analyze transcripts and determine common themes and priority domains. Standard 
analytic methods for qualitative data will be employed. A codebook will be 
developed based on deductive (theory -driven ) constructs from the interview guide 
and applied to a subset of transcripts. Concordance will be measured and  discrepant

 codes resolved by [CONTACT_172422]. We will 
identify and discuss initial themes and identify inductive (data -driven) codes. The 
identification  of inductive  codes  will continue  with subsequent  coding  in an iterative 
manner. Results will be shared and discussed with other investigators for final 
analysis and interpretation to determine what changes can be made (incorporating 
findings from Aim 2 as well) to improve the IPP -HPV intervention for future 
implementation.  
 
1.3 Specific Aim  2 
To evaluate receptivity and concerns of healthcare providers with inpatient postpartum HPV 
immuniz ation as part of IPP -HPV and to identify facilitators of and barriers to its 
implementation.  
1 .3 .1 Study participants: YNHH inpatient and Women’s Center outpatient postpartum 
nurses and obstetric providers affiliated with the Women’s Center or Center for 
Women’s  Health and Midwifery, including nursing and medical directors, will be 
eligible to  participate.  
1 .3 .2 Study  design:  
Study Enrollment and Consent: Postpartum nurses and providers will be invited to 
participate  in individual  in-depth  interviews  about  their percep tions  of IPP-HPV.  All 
participants  will receive  informed  consent  (see attached)  and a $[ADDRESS_202032] will be 
provided as an incentive to providers that  participate.  
Sampling : We will aim to have a purposive sample with representation by [CONTACT_172423]/location.  
1 .3 .3 Data collection: The in -depth individual interviews will be conducted using a semi - 
structured guide (see attached) based on Consolidated Framework for 
Implementation Research (CFIR) constructs. We will focus on CFIR constructs 
belonging to domains which we consider to be most relevant to IPP -HPV 
implementation from the providers’ perspective: Intervention Characteristics (e.g., 
perceived advantages and adaptability of the intervention), the Inner Setting (e.g., 
structural and cul tural contexts within the clinical setting), and Characteristics of 
Individuals (e.g., knowledge and beliefs about the  intervention).  
1 .3 .4 Data analysis: Recorded interviews will be transcribed and transcripts analyzed 
using standard analytic methods for qualit ative data as described above (see Aim 2). 
Provider receptivity of IPP -HPV and perceptions of patient acceptance will  be 
categorized by [CONTACT_172424]. Perceived barriers to and facilitators of IPP -HPV will be 
described and will further inform future implementatio n of IPP -HPV. Demographic 
data about postpartum providers will be tabulated. Quantitative data from the pre - 
and post -intervention provider surveys will be tabulated and differences compared 
using bivariate  analysis.

Measures that will be used from the IPP -HPV program to assess its implementation 
will include  number  of women  eligible  for HPV  vaccine,  proportion  accepting  a dose 
of HPV vaccine while inpatient, proportion who agree to be vaccinated but do not 
receive  the vaccine  dose,  and identification  of possible  barriers  to implementation  of 
IPP-HPV (e.g., nurses are too busy, patients leave prior to vaccine administration, 
vaccine order not placed). In addition, we will abstract data from questionnaires 
voluntarily sub mitted by [CONTACT_172425] -HPV Program on their 
experience with each patient related to HPV  immunization.  
 
We will obtain data on receipt of subsequent doses of vaccine and on completion of 
the 3 -dose series of the vaccine by [CONTACT_172426]. Dates of receipt of HPV 
vaccine, date of postpartum visit, and data on whether a dose of HPV vaccine was 
due at the postpartum visit and, if so, whether dose was received will be recorded. 
Data on the need for and receipt of postpartum Tdap, influenza and rubella vaccines 
will also be obtained from medical chart review for comparison. Demographic and 
clinical information will also be obtained. Historical data on the HPV vaccination 
history of all WC patients ≤ 26 years old who delivered in the 12 months  prior to 
implementation of IPP -HPV will also be collected for comparison of their rates of 
vaccine series completion (from outpatient administration) within 30 months  of 
delivery.  
1 .4 .4 Data analysis: We will tabulate measures as  follows:  
• IPP-HPV Acceptance: Proportion of eligible patients agreeing to receive a dose 
of vaccine  
• HPV Vaccine Administration: Proportion of eligible patients that agree to be 
vaccinated who actually receive dose of vaccine as an  inpatient.  
• Barriers to vaccination: descrip tive data on potential barriers to receiving  the 
vaccine postpartum  
• Other vaccines: Proportion of eligible patients due for Tdap, influenza or MMR 
vaccines and proportion that receive  each 
 
To assess the effectiveness of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_172394] -HPV immunization program we will 
tabulate the proportion of postpartum women eligible for the vaccine who receive a 
dose of HPV  vaccine,  the proportion  of participants  that need  1, 2, or 3 vaccine  doses 
that receive the respective number of doses within up to 30 months of postpartum 
discharge, the proportion of all participants that complete the vaccine series within 
12 months  and within 30 months , and the proportion  of study  participants  that 
complete  the vaccine  series within 12 months  and within 30 months  that received  
IPP-HPV.

Multivariable logistic regression will be used to determine predictors of inpatient 
postpartum HPV vaccine uptake and of vaccine completion (e.g., age, parity, race, 
ethnicity). The difference in proportion of women who complete the 3 -dose series 
within 12 months and within 30 months of postpartum discharge in the study cohort 
and in the group of Women’s Center patients who delivered in the 12 months prior 
to implementation of IPP -HPV will be compared using chi square ana lysis.

Inpatient OB providers, inpatient OB nurses, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172396] —will be invited to participate in individual in -depth  in person,or  
phone/video (Zoom) when in person is not possible, interviews to ascertain the 
strengths and problems with the current workflow processes from all perspectives. 
All participants will receive verbal informed consent (see attached) and a $[ADDRESS_202035] will be mailed or dropped off at their work office as an incentive to providers 
that participate. Sampling: We will aim to have a purposive sample with 
representation by [CONTACT_172428].  
 
1 .5 .3 Data  Collection:  
1) Observational Workflow Analysis - The observation workflow analysis will be 
conducted utilizing an open -ended observational guide (see attached) and will 
include the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_172397] (as they 
pertain to provider  status):  
a. Assessment of patie nt’s immunization  status  
b. Placing vaccine  order(s)  
c. Vaccine administration and  documentation  
The observations  will remain  open -ended  to allow  the observer  to document  detailed 
fieldnotes on events, actions and their time/duration and capture variations in 
workflow.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/3/[ADDRESS_202036] that does not capture any patient 
PHI (i.e. blank data fields before data is inputte d). 
 
2) In-depth Individual  Interview -- The in -depth individual interviews will be 
conducted  in person , or by [CONTACT_648]/video (Zoom) when in person is not possible , 
using a semi -structured guide (see attached) and cover the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]:  
a. Perceived bottlenecks  and facilitators to postpartum  immunization 
workflows  
b. Potential benefits and obstacles with any existing EMR -based tools  for 
postpartum vaccines (e.g. flowsheet, integrated order  set) 
c. Thoughts on postpartum vaccine workflow tasks that are redundant  or 
could be  streamlined  
d. Thoughts on postpartum vaccine workflow gaps that need to  be 
addressed  
Interviews will also maintain an open -ended question format to allow the 
interviewer to probe with follow -up questions or elaboration or clarification. 
Follow -up quest ions will be asked to engage participants to use their own words to 
express their perspectives on the strengths and problems with the existing 
postpartum vaccine work -flow process.  
 
1 .5 .4 Data  Analysis:  
1) Observational Workflow Analysis -Field notes will be transcribed using a digital 
writing  system.  
2) In-depth Individual Interview -- Recorded interviews will be transcribed, and 
transcripts analyzed using standard analytic methods for qualitative data as 
described above (see Aim  2). 
 
Data from the workflow analy sis and individual interviews will be analyzed using well - 
established  qualitative  data analysis  methods.  We will initially  approach  thematic  analysis  
using the principles of grounded theory. The PI/study team will inductively code the  
workflow and intervi ew data using the constant comparative method to identify concepts  
and themes  that emerge  within  each group,  and that are “grounded”  in the actions  and views  
of the participants This methodology involves using labels (i.e.  codes) to iteratively  
categorize text and observations of participants into concepts and themes. We will use  
Dedoose (version 7.0.23, SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC, 2016, Los Angeles,  
CA) for data management.  The coded  data will be used to iteratively  develop  process  maps  
for each vaccine and to identify gaps in the process to guide subsequent observations.  The 
maps will also indicate process variations and identify steps in which EMR tools are  
utilized. The process maps and interview data will b e reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_172398] a process map for IPP -HPV immunization. Data collection and analysis  
will occur over a 12 -month  period.

 1 .6 .1 Study Participants: Individual interviews will be conducted in person or by 
[CONTACT_648]/video (Zoom) when in person is not possible with the 4 stakeholder groups —
inpatient OB providers, inpatient OB nurses, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172399], and 
EMR  analyst s—from across YNHHS . In addition, a voluntary survey will be 
distributed to participants  from all stakeholder groups in YNHHS  to assess the 
knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about  HPV vaccine and about  IPP-HPV.  
Study Design: Individual interview topi[INVESTIGATOR_172400] 5 will be conducted at the same 
time as the interview perfor med in Aim  4. The  voluntary anonymous  survey will be 
distributed as a QR code  and/or web -based survey link  to all potential participants as 
part of the training and education of quality improvement program materials  at each 
YNHHS delivery network site. All participants  will receive  informed  consent  prior to 
continuing with the survey  and have the option to enroll in raffle to receive a $[ADDRESS_202037] as an incentive for  participation.  
1 .6 .2 Data Collection: In-depth, semi structured, individual interviews will be conducted 
with each participant described above. The semi -structured interview guide will 
cover  the following  topi[INVESTIGATOR_172401] a way to engage  participants 
to use their own words to express their needs and preference s related to an EMR - 
based tool for IPP -HPV  immunization . 
A) Potential benefits and obstacles with various EMR -based tool 
formats for IPP -HVP (e.g. flowsheet, integrated order set, 
electronic  chart)  
B) Timing of when tool should activate and how  often  
C) How intrusive tool should be (e.g. electronic alert, mandatory 
components)  
D) Preferences  and perceived  strengths  and problems  with Nurse  vs 
Pharmacy -driven IPP -HPV immunization  workflow  
E) Preferences for additional features (e.g.  automated fax of 
vaccine  administration  to PCP,  automated  population  of vaccine 
administration to patient discharge documents, option to order 
& hold future subsequent vaccine  doses.  
1 .6 .3 Data Collection for survey:  The knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of IPP -HPV by 
[CONTACT_172429]. The survey will highlight 
any concerns, expectations , and the amount of HPV vaccine knowledge held by 
[CONTACT_172430]. Questions will be asked in various formats, such as multiple 
choice, true and false questions , and 5-point Likert scale questions.  
1 .6 .4 Data analysis: Recorded interviews will be transcribed, and transcripts analyzed 
using standard analytic methods for qualitative data as stated in Aim 4  (1.5.4).  Survey

8. How will eligibility be determined, and by  [CONTACT_20898]?  
Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_172434]. They will be 
trained in study protocol includin g eligibility criteria by [CONTACT_978]. They will complete human subjects 
training. They will work closely with nurses and providers on the postpartum floor or at the clinic 
(Specific Aim 1: Patient interviews) or with Staffing Supervisors (Specific Aim 2, 4 & 5 : Provider 
interviews) to ensure recruitment is appropriate, sensitive, and non -coercive.  
 
9. Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts,  or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the  research.  
Participation in this study is considered to be minimal risk. There will be no physical, financial, or 
legal risks to subjects as a result of participating in this study.  One potential risk to study 
participants is in disclosing personal informati on to members of the research team during the 
interview that may be upsetting. Another potential risk is loss of confidentiality. Medical records 
will only be utilized to extract defined variables for research purposes. There are no other risks to 
patients , who will not be contact[CONTACT_172435],  and whose  care will not be impacted  in 
any way. Both of these risks are unlikely to occur, but will be minimized as described  below.  
 
10. Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which  the above -mentioned risks will be  minimized.

Aims 1 and 2: In the event that subjects were to find completing the interview distressing, they 
would be reminded that they are free to not respond to any questions and/or terminate the interview  
 
Page 19 of 26 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/3/2019   
 at any time. Referrals for services (medical and social) will be provided as necessary. Because 
participants are being recruited from a clinical setting, such services are known to investigators and 
referrals can be facilitated. Decisions on  whether or not to continue participation in this study will in 
no way affect the provision of medical care on the postpartum floor or in the outpatient clinic for 
patient participants or employment for provider participants. Interviewers will also be full y trained 
in non -judgmental interactions and counseling and referral if participants become distressed during 
the course of this  study.  
 
Aim 3: The risk associated with this portion of the study is potential breach of confidentiality. There 
are no other ri sks to patients, who will not be contact[CONTACT_172436], and whose care 
will not be impacted in any way. Medical records will only be utilized to extract defined variables 
for research purposes.  
 
Aims 4 and 5: In the event that subjects were to find completing the interview or survey distressing, 
they would be reminded that they are free to not respond to any questions and/or terminate the 
interview /survey  at any time. Decisions on whether or not to continue participation in this study 
will in  no way affect employment for provider and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172406]. Interviewers will also 
be fully trained in non -judgmental interactions and counseling and referral if participants become 
distressed during the course of this study.  
 
A number of preca utions will be actively integrated into study procedures to protect confidentiality.  
(1) For the qualitative data analysis, all data will be presented anonymously. Themes and quotes will 
be designated by [CONTACT_172437]/ethnicity, preferred language, age of patie nt, outpatient obstetrics site, and 
HPV vaccination completion status only, as these are the key variables of interest. Participants will be 
assured that the information they provide will not be linked to them as individuals in any study reports, 
publicati on or presentations. (2) All quantitative data will be analyzed collectively so that information 
from any individual will remain anonymous. (3) Study participants will be protected by [CONTACT_172438] a un ique study identification number only, 
assigned to the participant at the time of his or her entry into the study. Only this code and no 
identifying information (e.g. names) will be maintained in data files. A separate master list of names 
and medical reco rd numbers along with study identification numbers will be maintained in a password 
protected computer file. Access to the computers and data files stored on other media (e.g. flash drives) 
will be limited both physically (e.g. in locked offices) and elect ronically (e.g. on encrypted computers). 
All data files will be password protected and stored on a secure server. All paper records including 
consent forms will be kept in locked file cabinets. (4) The information obtained  will be used for the 
purposes  of data analysis  only.  (5) Upon  completion  of the data collection phase, the data will be "de -
identified" meaning that the identifying information (namely medical record number) will be separated 
from the clinical variables collected. The prompt removal of identifying  information  will help to limit  
the risk of breaches  of confidentiality.  Once  all data analysis has been completed, the master list 
containing the patient's medical record number will be destroyed in a manner approved by [CONTACT_172439].  
 
11. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final 
determinatio n of the risk to  subjects.)

12. Statistical  Considerations:  Describe  the statistical  analyses  that support  the study  design. 
Specific Aim  1: 
All interviews will be recorded and subsequently transcribed. We will analyze transcripts and 
determine  
common themes and priority domains. Standard analytic methods for qualitative data will be 
employed.15 A codeb ook will be developed based on deductive (theory -driven) constructs from the 
interview guide and applied to a subset of transcripts. Concordance will be measured and 
discrepant  codes  resolved  by [CONTACT_172440].  We will identify 
and discuss initial themes and identify inductive (data -driven) codes. The identification of 
inductive  codes  will continue  with subsequent  coding  in an iterative  manner.  Results  will be shared

 and discussed with other investigators for final analysis and interpretation to determine what 
changes can be made (incorporating findings from Aim 2 as well) to improve the IPP -HPV 
intervention for future implementation.  
 
Specific Aim 2:  
Recorded interviews will be transcribed an d transcripts analyzed using standard analytic methods 
for qualitative data as described above (see Aim 2). Provider receptivity of IPP -HPV and 
perceptions of patient acceptance will be categorized by [CONTACT_172424]. Perceived barriers to and 
facilitators of IPP -HPV will be described and will further inform future implementation of IPP - 
HPV.  Demographic  data about  postpartum  providers  will be tabulated.  Quantitative  data from  the 
pre- and post -intervention provider surveys will be tabulated and differences compared  using 
bivariate  analysis.  
 
Specific Aim 3:  
We will tabulate measures as follows:  
• IPP-HPV Acceptance: Proportion of eligible patients agreeing to receive a dose 
of vaccine  
• HPV Vaccine Administration: Proportion of eligible patients that agree to be 
vaccina ted who actually receive dose of vaccine as an  inpatient.  
• Barriers to vaccination: descriptive data on potential barriers to receiving  the 
vaccine postpartum  
• Other vaccines: Proportion of eligible patients due for Tdap, influenza or MMR 
vaccines and proportion that receive  each 
 
To assess the effectiveness of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_172394] -HPV immunization program we will tabulate 
the proportion of postpartum women eligible for the vaccine who receive a dose of HPV 
vaccine, the proportion of participants that need 1, 2, or 3 vaccine doses that receive the 
respective number of doses within 12 months of postpartum discharge, the proportion of 
all participants that complete the vaccine series within 12 months, and the proportion of 
study participants that complete the vaccine series within 12 months that received IPP - 
HPV.  
 
Multivariable logistic regression will be used to determine predictors of inpatient 
postpartum HPV vaccine uptake and of vaccine completion (e.g., age, parity, race, 
ethnicity). The difference in pro portion of women who complete the 3 -dose series within 
12 months  of postpartum  discharge  in the study  cohort  and in the group  of Women’s  Center 
patients who delivered in the 12 months prior to implementation of IPP -HPV will be 
compared using chi square  analysis.  
 
Specific Aim 4:  
All workflow analysis and individual interviews and will be recorded and subsequently 
transcribed. We will analyze transcripts and determine common themes and priority domains. 
Standard analytic methods for qualitative data will be employed.15 A codebook will be developed 
based on deductive (theory -driven) constructs from the interview guide and applied to a subset of 
transcripts. Concordance will be measured and discrepant codes resolved by [CONTACT_172441] e research.  We will identify  and discuss  initial  themes  and identify  inductive

an iterative manner. The coded data will be used to iteratively develop process maps for each 
vaccine  and to identify  gaps in the process  to guide  subsequent  observations.55  The maps  will also 
indicate process variations and identify steps in which EMR tools are  utilized.  
 
 
Specific Aim 5:  
All individual in terviews and will be recorded and subsequently transcribed. We will analyze 
transcripts and determine common themes and priority domains. Standard analytic methods for

research being proposed.  
 
Study personnel will receive training in  assessing a person’s ability and capacity to obtain consent. First, 
they will complete all human subjects training. Second, they will meet and work with postpartum nurses 
and clinicians at YNHH to learn how to handle situations in which capacity is of con cern. Postpartum 
nurses and clinicians will also be able to help identify patient participants for whom capacity may have 
been a concern during routine clinical care. Third, they will attend HIC training sessions as appropriate 
to learn more about the cons ent process.

Study Design:   
This is a Phase I/II, open -label, multi -center, dose escalation study to estimate the MTD (or MAD) of 
SEL24/MEN1703 in patients with AML . At the end of Part [ADDRESS_939336] of SEL24/MEN1703 has to be 
selected for further evaluation in Part 2. In Part 2 the safety and anti -leukemic activity of 
SEL24/MEN1703 will be further assessed  in the study population.  
SEL24/MEN1703 is taken orally once daily ( QD) for 14 consecutive days over a 21- day treatment cycle.  
 
NOTE: At the time this protocol V ersion 12.0 is running, Part 1 has been completed. Procedures 
to be followed along Part 1 are reported below for completeness  
 Part 1  was initially designed with an accelerated titration design  (ATD)  for the first 4 cohorts . The study 
design has then been revised to follow a 3+3 design from Cohort 2 (50mg) onwards in order to assess 
for DLT, adverse events  and adequate PK profile data  from at least 3 patients in each  dose level  (see 
Table 3 ). Patients will be enrolled to cohorts in a sequential fashion following the dosing regimen and 
will be observed for safety and tolerability during Cycle 1, prior to permitting dose escalation to the next 
dose level (cohort ). From Cohort [ADDRESS_939337] 7 
days for each patient enrolled.

Should a patient experience a toxicity which qualifies as a DLT during Cycle 1 in any cohort, th at cohort 
will be expanded to enroll up to a maximum of 6 patients to further assess for toxicity prior to considering 
the next dosing step .  
 
Cohort 4 (100mg) repeated twice due to the introduction of a  new formulated SEL24/MEN1703 IMP. 
To distinguish between the original cohort and the repeat cohort at the same dose level , the repeat cohort 
is named  Cohort 4F.  
 No recruitment interval is applied in the Cohort 4F where formulated SEL24/MEN1703 IMP is 
introduced, as this  dose level has already been explored with the non- formulated SEL24/MEN1703 API 
[INVESTIGATOR_692580].  Upon the successful completion of the repeat Cohort 4F with the formulated IMP , the study 
will progress to the next Cohort 4b and onwards, according to the study design, using  SEL24/MEN1703 
formulated IMP only. In particular it has been shown that, o verall, PK disposition of SEL24/MEN1703 
(absorption, distribution and elimination) following the administration of formulated IMP is in line with that observed with non- formulated IM P. This evidence further  supports that no dose adjustment is 
warranted with formulated IMP.  
 Patients who commenced dosing with the non-formulated SEL24/MEN1703 API [INVESTIGATOR_692581], will continue receiving this formulation  until treatment withdrawal per protocol.  
 Recruitment and dose escalation for each cohort in Part 1 is described in Table 3 .

The DMC consisting of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12758], plus the Medical Monitor  and Sponsor 
representatives, will review all safety data available during Cycle 1 for each cohort and assess for DLT 
during Part 1 of the study.  Experts in the evaluation of PK and PD data may participate in the DMC 
meetings to help inform the next dose escalation step.  Further details of DMC procedures/participants 
in the different parts of the study are reported in the ad -hoc charter. 
 The dose escalation rules to be followed during Part 1 of the study are described in Table 4.

previously at that dose.  
NOTE: at the 150 mg dose, additional 4 patients will be tested 
targeting  ≤ 25% toxicity  rate as described above.

entered  at the proposed recommended dose level  for Part 2 .  
 In addition to DLT evaluation, there will be ongoing assessment of all adverse events ( AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs), changes in laboratory values (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, lipid 
profile, and urinalysis ) and electrocardiograms as further measures of safety and tolerability. All safety 
parameters will continue to be assessed beyond Cycle 1. Note that where the DMC is  concerned about 
any safety signal in the study e.g. a trend in Grade [ADDRESS_939343] SEL24/MEN1703 dose level considered to be well tolerated, and to have optimal PK and 
PD characteristics, will be called the RD and will be selected for further evaluation in Part 2.

CLI24 -[ADDRESS_939344] (identified in Part 1 based on 
recommendation by [CONTACT_1363]) in the expansion cohorts defined below: 
- The expansion cohort in 20 unselected relapsed or refractory AML patients  patients (“all-
comers ”)  
NOTE: At the time this protocol version 12.0 is running , the expansion cohort in “all-
comers ”AML patients has been already completed with 23 patients enrolled.  
- An additional expansion cohort (“ IDH mutants” ) will enroll approximately 20 relapsed or 
refractory AML patients harboring an IDH mutation (either IDH1 or IDH2).  
The evaluable patients treated at the RD  in Part 1 or in Part 2 may be also retrospectively included in 
exploratory safety/efficacy pooled analysis , including patients with comparable inclusion criteria.  
Considering that IDH inhibitors are approved/available only in some of the participating  countries, it is 
anticipated  that the study will enroll both IDH inhibitor pre -treated and IDH inhibitor na ïve patients.  For 
this reason, the recruitment will aim to have a balanced distribution across the two sub -populations to 
explore the differences in SEL24/MEN1703 activity  between pre-treated and IDH inhibitor naïve 
patients , if any. 
Retrospective correlations between the clinical activity of SEL24/ MEN1703 and relevant disease 
markers (e .g. CD25 expression, FLT3 mutational status, IDH1/IDH2 mutational status, others) may be 
included in the statistical analysis plan.  
 
In both Parts of the  study, the criteria for retreatment described in Section 4.[ADDRESS_939345]  be met prior to 
proceeding to administer a further cycle of treatment . 
 Dose Limiting Toxicity: 
DLT events for dose escalation decisions will be assessed to the end of Cycle [ADDRESS_939346] be conducted o ver 42 days.  Ongoing safety events beyond Cycle 1 will be reviewed 
across all cohorts during the study to help inform dos e escalation decisions.  
 AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE) V4.03. The AEs listed below will be considered as DLT unless they are 
clearly and incontrovertibly attributable to the underlying disease or to an extraneous cause:  
• Grade 5 toxicity  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥42 days from the start of the th erapy cycle in absence of 
evidence of active AML (<5% blasts)  
• Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity, except :

• Disease progression.  
Note: Patients with disease progression may continue to receive SEL24/MEN1703, if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], they remain clinically stable and may be deriving potential clinical benefit from SEL24/MEN1703 and it is not considered detrimental to the patient to

• Treatment non -compliance.  
Note: Treatment non-compliance will be based on patient enquiry and SEL24/MEN1703 
capsule count on return of used IMP to pharmacy. In Part 1, it will be defined as missing 
more than 2 doses in a 14-day dosing schedule in Cycle 1. After Cycle 1 and throughout 
Part 2, treatment compliance will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.    
• Study non-compliance.  
Note: Each patient’s continued willingness to attend study visits and undergo study 
assessments will be assessed on a case -by-case basis.  
• Investigator decision that it is in the patient’s best interest to withdraw from the study.  
 Continuation of the study treatment may be discussed between the Investigator and the Sponsor on a 
case by [CONTACT_413].  The DMC may also advise on the suitability of an individual patient to continue to 
receive study treatment.   
 Study Assessments:  
Safety Adverse events, clinical chemistry, hematological , coagulation,  lipid profile and urinalysis parameters 
will be assessed. All clinical AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
V4.03. DLT, SAEs  and AEs l eading to treatment discontinuations will be determined.  
 Patients will also undergo regular physical examination, vital sign,  ECG and urinalysis assessments.  
 Disease assessment  
Disease assessment will involve evaluation of leukemic blast proportion in the bone marrow. 
Hematologic parameters from the routine local assessments including blast percentage (where applicable), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count, and other relevant parameters such as 
transfusion dependence will also contribute to this assessment. Evaluation of disease status will be performed at the time- points described in the Schedule of Study Assessment  (Table 5 ). To note , disease 
assessment must be performed as soon as the peripheral lab results become consistent with an objective response. Disease assessment will also include an aliquot  of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy that will be 
centrally stored for future analysis (e.g. minimal residual disease), if any.  
In case bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy  is consistent with  CRi or better response, but still a minimal  
percentage of peripheral blasts is detected , the response assessment can be postponed up to [ADDRESS_939353] bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_692582].

Transfusion conversion rate and transfusion maintenance ra te  
Starting from Protocol V12.0, information about transfusion dependency will be collected and evaluated among study endpoints. For the purpose of defining transfusion conversion rate and transfusion maintenance rate, transfusion status (independent Vs. dependent) at baseline period and post -baseline 
period are defined as  follows for subjects who took at least one dose of study drug: 
 Baseline transfusion status : 
• Baseline period is defined as the period from [ADDRESS_939354] 
dose (C2D7). For subjects who are on treatment <[ADDRESS_939355] dose (in the event that this information is not available the ICF signature [CONTACT_692684] ) until the end of treatment.  
• Subjects are classified as baseline transfusion independent if there is no  red blood cells ( RBC ) 
or platelet transfusions within the baseline period; otherwise, the subject is to be considered as 
baseline transfusion dependent.  
Post-baseline t ransfusion status: 
• Post-baseline period is defined as the period from [ADDRESS_939356] dose (day after C2D7) until 
last dose.  
• For subjects who are on treatment  ≥84 days  (C5D1 or more), subjects are classified post- baseline 
transfusion independent if there is one consecutive [ADDRESS_939357]- baseline period . 
• For subjects who are on treatment >28 days  (beyond C2D7) but <84 days (up to C4D21), post -
baseline transfusion status is not evaluable . 
• Otherwise, the subject is considered post- baseline transfusion dependent.  
Both transfusion conversion rate and maintenance rate apply  to subjects who ha ve evaluable post -
baseline transfusion status.  
Transfusion conversion rate is defined as the number of subjects who were transfusion dependent at 
baseline period but become transfusion independent at post -baseline period divided by [CONTACT_692616]. Transfusion maintenance rate is defined as the number of subje cts who were transfusion independent at baseline period and still maintain 
transfusion independent at post -baseline period divided by [CONTACT_692617].  
 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell tran splant (HSCT) rate 
Allogeneic HSCT rate is defined as the percentage of subjects undergoing allo -SCT during the study 
period. MRD status will be recorded immediately  prior to the transplant and after the procedure 
whenever a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy will be collected (recommended every 2 months unless differently indicated by [CONTACT_692618] ’s parameters).  
In the event a patient undergoes allogeneic HSCT, the following information will be recorded: a) date of transplant; b) HLA match type (HLA -identical sibling, syngeneic, HLA -matched other relative, HLA -

1. I NTRODUCTION
1.1. Acut
e Myeloid Leukemia
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a malignancy of a myeloid precursor cell, is an extremely 
aggressive malignancy; patients treated with supportive care alone have a median survival of 2.5 
months1. In the [LOCATION_002] it was estimated that there would be approximately 14 ,500 new cases 
of AML in [ZIP_CODE], in the European Union (EU), annual incidence is on the order of 20,000 new 
cases3. AML represents approximately 25% of all adult leukemias as measured by [CONTACT_692624]4. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_692586], the mainstay of initial 
treatment of AML was developed nearly 40  years ago as a combination of cytosine arabinoside 
(ara-C or cytarabine) with an anthracycline (this combination is known as ‘7+3’), and remains the 
standard of care.  Approximately 60% to 70% of adults with AML can be expected to attain a CR 
following appropriate induction therapy; however, over half of these patients will subsequently relapse and only about 25% of adults with AML can be expected to survive [ADDRESS_939383] very poor prognosis.  
In patients who relapse within 6 months of attaining CR (regardless of age), the prognosis remains particularly poor. Some patients who hav e had a prolonged period of CR may respond a second 
time to standard therapy (cytarabine plus an anthracycline, ‘7+3’), but for patients who are refractory to this regimen, there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_692587]. 
AML 
is primarily a disease of older adults and the median age of pati ents at diagnosis is 65  years. 
Age plays a key role in the prognosis of AML; 5-year survival of patients younger than 45 is over 50%, but drops to less than 5% for patients older than 65 years
4. There are several factors that 
contribute to this s urvival disparity based on age.  Firstly, older patients exhibit a worse 
performance status  than younger patients, often due to i ntercurrent medical conditions.  Secondly, 
AML in older patients is more frequently associated with unfavorable cytogenetics, which implies a greater degree of genetic damage and drug resistance.  Finally, older AML patients exhibit a 
higher frequency of multi -drug resistance ( mdr) expression, which also contributes to drug 
resistance
5. These aspects of AML in the elderly are reflected in several key outcomes: compared 
with patients [ADDRESS_939384] lower rates of CR (39% vs. 64%); higher rates of mortality within 30- days after induction (23% vs. 3%); and lower overall 
median survival times (6.9 month s vs. 18.8 months)
5. Given these poor outcomes, many older 
patients are not considered to be candidates for aggressive remission induction therapy, may now 
receive combination treatments s uch as low dose cytarab ine with either venetoclax or glasdegib or 
a hypo methylating agent  (azacitidine/azacy tidine or decitabine) with venetoclax . 
Altho
ugh specific treatments are available for patients with AML harboring specific mutations, 
relapsed or refractory AML remains one of the largest unmet needs in medicine, particularly in patients that have already failed target salvage options, where any.  
1.2. SEL24/M
EN1703 
Menarini Ricerche S.p.A  (hereinafter referred to as Menarini) is develop ing a dual kinase inhibitor

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3 -ITD) is one of the most common 
genetic lesions in AML and is associated with a poor long -term prognosis6. Although FLT3 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors are now approved for commercial use, the medical need in FLT3 mutated 
AML patients is still largely unmet, particularly – though not limited - in patients with relapsed or 
refractory disease.  PIM (proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus) kinases are 
thought to be major drivers of the resistance phenotype and their inhibition in relapsed samples 
restores cell sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors7. Thus, simultaneous PIM and FLT3 inhibition 
represents a promising strategy in AML th erapy. 
 
1.3. Non-Clinical Studies with SEL24/MEN1703 
SEL24/MEN1703, a potent PIM and FLT3-ITD dual activity inhibitor, demonstrates significantly broader activity in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts, irrespective of FLT3 status, than selective FLT3 -ITD or PIM inhibitors. 
 In vitro  studies and in vivo  nonclinical pharmacology studies in mouse leukemia human xenograft 
models have been conducted to evaluate the anticancer potential of SEL24/MEN1703. Evaluation 
of SEL24/MEN1703 by [CONTACT_692625]1208, and slightly lower activity than quizartinib for the FLT3 mutant.  
 SEL24/MEN1703 demonstrates strong cytotoxic effects in AML cell lines, independently of FLT3 
status, in contrast to quizartinib and AZD1208, which show more narrow therapeutic potential. 
 The unique mechanism of inhibiting both PIM and FLT3 kinases translates into potent effects in in vivo  models.  SEL24/MEN1703 shows anticancer effects in subcutaneous xenografts AML 
models and is superior to quizartinib and AZD1208, depending on the genetic background of mutations.  Nonclinical pharmacology study results suggest that SEL24/MEN1703 may offer a 
comprehensive approach to targeting the PIM/FLT3 axis in AML patients and that the activity can be further enhanced by [CONTACT_692626].  In vitro  and in vivo  safety pharmacology studies have been conducted.  In vitro  studies included 
nuclear receptor binding studies, hERG inhibition and hERG  tail currents recorded from 
transfected HEK293 cells.  An in vivo  GLP study has been conducted in male Beagle dogs to 
evaluate the effects on cardiovascular and neurobehavioral functions.  
 SEL24/MEN1703 was tested on a panel of G -protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other 
receptors. The compound was tested at the high concentration of 10 µM. Three receptors were 
identified as inhibited more than 85% (NK1, 5HT2B, and sigma).  Both receptors were tested for 
agonistic and antagonistic activity of SEL24/MEN1703. No agonistic activity was detected.  
 Results of evaluation of hERG currents indicated that for SEL24/MEN1703, the hERG IC
50 was 
3.561 µM. For the positive control, E -4031, the mean hERG inhibition was 88.5%. In addition, 
SEL24/MEN1703 inhibited hERG  tail current in HEK293 cells stably transfected with hERG 
cDNA with an estimated IC [ADDRESS_939385] of SEL24/MEN1703 at doses of 5, 10 
and 20 mg/kg on arterial blood pressure, heart  rate, lead II ECG intervals, core body temperature 
and on neurobehavioral functions was assessed in conscious telemetered Beagle dogs.  After the 
administration of SEL24/MEN1703 at these doses, no effect was noted on arterial blood pressure, 
heart rate, lead II ECG intervals and core body temperature. The evaluation of neurobehavioral 
parameters, both direct and remote, did not show changes compared with vehicle at any dose level.  
 Pharmacokinetic studies have been per formed in mouse, rat, and dog. The pharmacokinet ic profile 
of SEL24/MEN1703 obtained in vivo  in mice, rats and dogs confirmed good bioavailability and a 
favorable profile for oral administration.  In vivo  efficacious doses as low as 25 mg/kg twice daily 
(BID) in the mouse leads to complete biomarker response in tumor and spleen including inhibition of phosphorylation of the classical PIM target S6 (Ser235/236 and Ser240/244). According to 
PK/PD modelling analysis based on MOLM16 cell line xenograft data  performed with the aim to 
investigate the exposure- response relationship between p lasma SEL24/MEN1703 concentration 
and inhibition of S6 (Ser235/236) phosphorylation, the IC50 is expected at a plasma concentration 
of approximately 800 ng/mL . A dose of 25 mg/kg QD in rat reaches therapeutic plasma levels of 
biomarker inhibition and administration of 100 mg/kg QD in rat leads to approximately 3 times higher compound concentration in plasma than th e predicted therapeutic level. Pharmacokinetic 
studies confirmed that QD administration is sufficient to maintain therapeutic exposure in rats.  In 
another study, bioavailability was evaluated in fasted as well as non -fasted female Sprague Dawley 
rats. Good absolute bioavailability (calculated from AUC
0-t), i.e., higher than 70%, was shown for 
both conditions after oral administration in an aqueous solution formulation; however, the non-fasted state showed slightly higher oral bioavailability than the fasted state (76.2% vs . 70.2%). 
 Non-GLP repeat -dose toxicity studies have been conducted in rat and dog and GLP repeat -dose 
studies have been carried out in rat and dog. The non-GLP studies confirmed the therapeutic index and lack of any toxicology findings at therapeutic doses by [CONTACT_692627]. 
These studies also demonstrated that adverse effects observed at higher doses are completely or partially reversible in a follow -up recovery period. 
 A non -GLP 10 -day twice daily oral gavage toxicity study in rats established that the severely toxic 
dose resulting in 10% lethality (STD10) for SEL24/MEN1703 administered twice daily (12 h ± 1 
h apart) was between 50 and 100 mg/kg/day under those experimental conditions.  In a two -week repeat -dose followed by a two-week recovery period study in rats, the highest dose 
level of 80 mg/kg/day induced mortality and severe clinical signs after at least 10 days of daily administration in relation  to kidney and liver toxicity. At 20 and 40 mg/kg/day given for two weeks, 
SEL24/MEN1703 induced adverse dose -related degeneration/regeneration (tubulonephrosis) in 
the kidney, and bile duct hyperplasia in the liver.  The dose level of 20 mg/kg/day was expected to 
be a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) with sufficient plasma exposure. However, based on kidney and liver adverse pathological changes observed at all doses in both sexes, no NOAEL 
or STD10 could be established under these experimental conditions.  A GLP two -cycle study of two -week oral repeat -doses followed by a four -week recovery period 
was conduct ed in rats in which SEL24/MEN1703 was administered orally to Crl:CD(SD) rats once

daily for two cycles of 14 days separated by [CONTACT_692628].  Rats were treated 
at doses of 0 (vehicle), 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg/day (as parent). At 25 mg/kg/day, SEL24/MEN1703-
related findings were observed in the thymus and sternum -bone marrow from males and females, 
and in the liver, adrenals and mammary gland from males only; at 50 mg/kg/day, 
SEL24/MEN1703- related findings were observed in thymus, sternum bone -marrow, kidneys, liver 
and adrenals from both sexes, and in male (prostate and seminal vesicles) and female (ovaries, vagina, cervix and uterus) reproductive tracts.  Overall, males were more affected in terms of 
incidence and severity compared to females,  and the liver (degenerative and proliferative changes 
in the intra and extra- hepatic biliary system), kidney (renal degenerative/ necrotic changes of the 
proximal tubule), and male/female reproductive tract (endocrine disruption) findings were considered adverse at 50 mg/kg/day. These findings were sometimes associated to clinical 
pathology and organ weight changes; furthermore, clinical observations (mainly pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657]) and decreases in the body weight/body weight gain and food consumption were also observed at 50 mg/kg/day at the end of each treatment cycle.  Based on the pathology findings, the NOAEL is 
considered to be 25 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to mean C
max and AUC 0-24 values of 570 ng/mL 
and 8950 ng.hr/mL in males and to mean C max and AUC 0-24 values of 579 ng/mL and 7920 
ng.hr/mL in females after two cycles of [ADDRESS_939386] dose of 10 mg/kg was well -tolerated when administered for 10 days.  
The next higher dose of 30 mg/kg demonstrated clear toxicity and is considered not suitable for studies of longer duration. The highest dose of 60 mg/kg necessitated early kill of both male and 
female dogs and was clearly beyond the maximum tolerated dose.  
 A GLP two -cycle 14 -day oral repeat -dose toxicity study was conducted in Beagle dogs followed 
by a four-week treatment- free recovery period. SEL24/MEN1703 was administered orally to 
Beagle dogs QD for 2 cycles of 14 days separated by [CONTACT_692629] 0 (vehicle), 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day. Treatment resulted in severe clinical signs, marked 
limp of the right and/or left hind limb, reduction of proprioceptive refle x, reduction in body weight 
and food consumption in animals at 20 mg/kg/day leading to early termination of one male and two females.  Microscopic findings in the gall bladder, liver, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, 
jejunum, ileum), kidneys, lymphoid organs/tissue (thymus, spleen- white pulp, mandibular and 
mesenteric lymph nodes, Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)), hematopoietic tissue 
(sternum- bone marrow) and prostate were variably observed in surviving and prema ture decedents

The drug interaction potential of SEL24/MEN1703 has been character ized in detail in an extensive 
range of in vitro  drug interaction studies as outlined in the FDA Guidance for Industry: Drug 
Interaction Studies -Study Design, Data Analysis, Implications for Dosing, and Labeling 
Recommendations (Draft Guidance, February 2012) and in the EMA Guideline on the 
investigatio n of drug interactions (June 21, 2012). These studies indicate that SEL24/MEN1703 
may inhibit CYP2D6 and act as a substrate for CYP2D6 and BCRP.    
 
Please refer to the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure for further information on the non -
clinical studies with SEL24/MEN1703. 
 
1.4. Rationale for SEL24/MEN1703 Starting Dose Selection  and Dose Escalation Plan 
The first -in-human (FIH) starting dose for the clinical study  in patients with AML was derived 
based on data accumulated from preclinical non -GLP a nd GLP repeat oral dose toxicology studies 
with SEL24/MEN1703 conducted in rats and dogs. The dog was the more sensitive species and 
the observations from the repeat dose dog GLP toxicology study form the basis for the rationale for the FIH starting dose.   This FIH study initially employed  an accelerated dose escalation design  for the first [ADDRESS_939387] cohort (1 patient, in the absence of unacceptable 
toxicity), followed by a dose of 50, 75 and 100 mg in Cohort s 2, 3 and 4, respectively  (1 patient  
per cohort , in the absence of unacceptable toxicity).  Thereafter, dose escalation was to  proceed 
according to a conventional 3 + 3 design with successive cohorts having dose increments of 50% or less.  
 The 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg doses in humans were supported by [CONTACT_11339]- clinical toxicology findings 
in animals.  Rats and dogs were administered daily doses of SEL24/MEN1703 for two 14- day 
cycles with one week  rest between treatment cycles, followed by a [ADDRESS_939388] -in-human clinical study in 
patients with AML.  
 Doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg (human equivalent dose [HED] of 60, 150 and 300 mg/m
2, 
respectively) were administered to rats with no significant toxicity findings.  Since no MTD was 
achieved, the rat was considered the less sensitive species.  
 Doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg (HED of 100, 200 and 400 mg/m
2, respectively) were administered 
to dogs. The dog was considered the more sensitive species since the 20 mg/kg SEL24/MEN1703 
dose resulted in severe clinical signs leading to early termination of 3 out of 12 animals.   
 Following a four -week recovery period, SEL24/MEN1703- related findings were reversible in all 
dose groups.  Based on the findings in dogs, the NOAEL was 5 mg/kg and the highest non- severely 
toxic dose (HNSTD ) was 10 mg/kg.  
 As shown in the tables below, the HED of the NOAEL in dogs is 170 mg, based on a human BSA of 1.7 m
2. Per the ICH S9 guidance, an appropriate human starting dose would be 50 mg, which is 
1/6th the HNSTD in dogs. T his study commenced with a lower starting dose of [ADDRESS_939389] safe dose tested in rats.

in Table 8 .

 Accelerated titration design had continued through to Cohort 4. At the 150 mg dose level (the first 
cohort to be enrolled following the 3+3 design), DLTs were  reported in 2 patients  (another patient 
experienced a DLT event at 25 mg dose level) . The occurrence of these two events meeting the  
DLT definition at the 150 mg dose level  led to an adjustment of the dose escalation plan for this 
study, whereby [CONTACT_692630]24/MEN1703 was more thoroughly evaluated following a “3+3” design .

The subsequent restarting dose level of 50 mg (Cohort 2) following a 3+3 design was selected, 
also supported by [CONTACT_692631]24 -001 s tudy: the total (AUC) and 
maximum (C max) exposure of SEL24/MEN1703 observed in the patients were  within, or slightly 
exceeding the toxicological coverage established in dog at the dose of 5  mg/kg, which was defined 
as the HNSTD . After single and repeat dose administration of SEL24/MEN1703 25 mg and 50 
mg, C max and AUC (0-t) observed in human were more than 11 and 9 times lower than those observed 
in dogs at the HNSTD, respectively . Overall, the PK results obtained that far in human confirm ed 
that SEL24/MEN1703 exposure at 25 mg and 50 mg is  below 1/6 of the exposure obtained at the 
HNSTD defined in dog (i.e. the most se nsitive toxicological species).  Moreover, it is noted that 
the dog is a relevant species also from a metabolic point of view, with the M3 metabolite similarly 
identified as the main metabolite in human and canine plasma.  In a dedicated 10 -day toxicology 
study in the dog (treated at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg), the parent drug and the M3 metabolite were measured in plasma: the presence of M3 metabolite was confirmed and, at 10 mg/kg, i t was double 
and one third compared to parent drug in the male and female animals, respectively . 
As of  toda
y, 48 patients were dosed with SEL24/MEN1703 at the doses levels described in Table 
9, including [ADDRESS_939391] of 125 mg:

 Guidance Information for Investigators 
Throughout the study, Investigator s should refer to the current edition of the Investigator ’s 
Brochure (IB) for a full review of the potential risks associated with treatment with SEL24/MEN1703 and details of expected AEs.  
Base
d on available safety data, administration of SEL24/MEN1703 may be associated with the 
potential risk of fatal thrombosis  and severe hepatotoxicity . In addition, hypophosphatemia has 
occurred at the 25, 50, 75, and [ADDRESS_939393] been identified for SEL24/MEN1703 according to available clinical 
data. Nevertheless, results from non- clinical data do not allow to exclude the potential ph ototoxic 
effect of MEN1703. To this end, new safety measures - Inclusion of photosensitivity/phototoxicity

3.3. Definition of Evaluable Patient and Replacement of Patients  
In Part  [ADDRESS_939400] 12 of their 14 doses  of SEL24/MEN1703 
within the required 14-day treatment period in order to be ev aluable.  If a patient is withdrawn from 
the study for reasons other than a DLT -associated event before the end of the first treatment cycle, 
the patient must be replaced so that the required number of patients in the cohort is evaluable for 
the dose escalation decis ion. Patients who withdraw from the study or discontinue treatment after 
completion of the first treatment cycle will not be replaced.  
 In Part 2, patients may be replaced if they are not considered evaluable for safety  (all patients  who 
received at least  a dose of SEL24/MEN1703). Patients in Part 2 may also be replaced if they 
received one or more  administrations of SEL24/MEN1703 without having one post -treatment bone 
marrow disease assessment.  
In this latter event, patients may be replaced only if  the he matology assessments performed on 
peripheral blood shall  not indicate a clear  disease progression. 
 
3.4. Reasons for Withdrawal of Patient from Study 
Throughout the study, treatment with SEL24/MEN1703 may continue until the occurrence of one of the following events, whichever comes first:  
 
• Patient withdrawal of consent.  
• Disease progression.  Note: Patients with disease progression may continue to receive SEL24/MEN1703 , if

potential clinical benefit from SEL24/MEN1703 and it is not considered detrimental 
to the patient to continue study treatment.  
• Treatment delay of more than 2 weeks for reasons other than toxicity (see Section 4.4) . 
• Occurrence of an unacceptable toxicity (see Section 4.4 ). 
• Requirement for tr eatment with prohibited medication (see Section 6.9.3 ). 
• Treatment non -compliance.  
Note: Treatment non-compliance will be based on patient enquiry and 
SEL24/MEN1703 capsule count on return of used investigational medical product 
(IMP) to site. In Part 1 it will be defined as missing more than 2 doses in a 14-day 
dosing schedule in Cycle  1. After Cycle 1 and throughout Part 2, treatment compliance 
will be assessed on a case-by-case basis (see also Section 4.4 ).   
• Study non-compliance.  
Note: Each patient’s continued willingness to attend study visits and undergo study 
assessments will be assessed on a case -by-case basis.  
• Investigator decision that it is in the patient’s best interest to withdraw from the study.  
 
Where appropriate (e.g. in the case of disease progression ), continuation of the study treatment 
will be discussed between the Investigator and the Sponsor on a ca se by [CONTACT_413].  The DMC may 
also advise on the suitability of an individual patient to continue to receive study treatment.  
 Patients who experience a DLT will be permitted to receive further treatment with SEL24/MEN1703 according to  the dose modification  criteria described in Section 4.4
. 
 
3.5. Screen -failure patient and procedures for re-screening  
Screen -failure patient  is defined as any patient who does not meet eligibility criteria required for 
study  participation or for whom the time window between Screening and C1D1 is longer than 28 
days.   
 Any patient who has screen -failed may be re- screened at a later date should it be determined the 
patient  meet s eligibility (e.g. out of range lab value). Re-screening patients  will be registered in 
IWRS with a new screening number and they must sign a new consent form if the first dose of 
study drug is given  more than [ADDRESS_939401] consent form. 
 
3.6. Procedures for Patient Discontinuatio n 
If a patient withdraws from the study prior to study completion, the reason for withdrawal should be sought and recorded in the patient file and the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Every effort 
will be made to complete the Final Study Visit.  
 The Final Study Visit will be performed up to [ADDRESS_939402] dose of SEL24/MEN1703. 
Unscheduled assessments showing disease progression and leading to subject’s withdrawal can replace the Final Study  Visit provided that all assessment/procedures scheduled for this visit are 
completed.  
After the Final Study Visit, all subjects evaluable for efficacy will be followed for survival /disease

3.7. Study or Site Termination 
If the Sponsor or their representatives, Investigator, or Competent Authority officials discover conditions during the study that indi cate that the study or site involvement should be terminated, 
this action may be taken after appropriate consultation with the Sponsor and the Investigator.  
Conditions that may warrant termination of the study or involvement of a study site include, but are not limited to:  
 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the study. 
• The decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, 
or development of the study drug. 
• Failure of the Inve stigator(s) to comply with pertinent clinical study  regulations.  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the Sponsor, 
study m onitor, or Competent Authority. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
 In any case, the study will end  with the Final  Study Visit of the last subject who discontinues the 
study treatment. . For safety monitoring, all serious adverse events (SAEs) with a suspected causal 
relationship to the study treatment that occur after  the End of Study must be recorded and notified 
to the Sponsor.  Study termination and follow -up will be performed in accordance with applicable local regulations .

4.STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase I/II, open -label, multi -center, dose escalation study to estimate the MTD (or MAD)
of SEL24/MEN1703 in patients with AML. At the end of Part [ADDRESS_939404] of SEL24/MEN1703 will
be selected for further evaluation in Part 2. In Part 2 the safety and anti- leukemic activity of
SEL24/MEN1703 will be further assessed  in the study population.
The starting dose will be 25 mg SEL24/MEN1703 taken orally QD for [ADDRESS_939405] be followed prior to proceeding to administer a further cycle of treatment.
4.1. Part 1
 
At t
he time this protocol Version 12 .0 is running , Part 1 has been completed; procedures are 
reported below for completeness.  
Part 
[ADDRESS_939406] 4 cohorts . The study design has then been 
revised to follow a 3+3 design from Cohort 2 (50mg)  onwards in order to assess for DLT, adverse 
events, and adequate PK profile data from at least 3 patients in each dose level (see Table 
3).Patients will be enrolled to cohorts in a sequential fashion following the dosing regimen and  
will be  observed for safety and tolerability during Cycle 1, prior to permitting dose escalation to 
the next dose level (cohort). From Cohort [ADDRESS_939407] 7 days for each patient enrolled.  
Shou
ld a patient experience a toxicity which qualifies as a DLT during Cycle 1 in any cohort, that 
cohort will be expanded to enroll up to a maximum of 6 patients to further assess for toxicity prior 
to considering the next dosing step.  
Cohort 4 (100mg) 
is repeated twice due to the introduction of a new formulated SEL24/MEN1703 
IMP.  
To dis
tinguish between the original cohort and the repeat cohort at the same dose level, the repeat 
cohort i s named  Cohort 4F.  
No r
ecruitment interval is applied in the coh ort 4F where formulated SEL24/MEN1703 IMP is 
introduced, as this  dose level has already been explored with the non- formulated SEL24/MEN1703 
API [INVESTIGATOR_692580].  Upon the successful completion of the repeat cohort with the formulated IMP , the 
study will  progres s to the next Cohort 4b and onwards, according to the study design, using 
SEL24/MEN1703 formulated IMP only . In particular , it has been shown that, overall, PK 
disposition of SEL24/ MEN1703 (absorption, distribution and elimination) following the 
administration of formulated IMP is in line with that observed with non -formulated IMP. This 
evidence further  supports that no dose adjustment is warranted with formulated IMP. 
Patient
s who commenced dosing  with the non-formulated SEL24/MEN1703 API [INVESTIGATOR_692592], will continue receiving this formulation until treatment withdrawal per protocol.

assess for DLT during Part 1 of the study (see Section 4.3
). Experts in the evaluation of the PK 
and PD data may participate in the DMC meetings to help inform the next dose escalation step.  
 The dose escalation rules to be followed during Part 1 of the study are described in Table 4.

In addition to DLT evaluation, there will be ongoing assessment of all AE and SAEs, changes in laboratory values ( clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, lipid profiles) and ECG s as further 
measures of safety and tolerability.  All safety parameters will continue to be assessed beyond Cycle 
1. Note that where the DMC is concerned about any safety signal in the study e.g. a trend in Grade 
2 events, they may recommend a cohort is expanded to evaluate up to 6 patients, in order to explore 
this safety signal further.

4.2. Part [ADDRESS_939413] (identified in Part 1 based on 
recommendation by [CONTACT_1363]) in the expansion cohorts defined below:

CLI24 -001 V1 3.0 Final 2 7JUN2022                                                                                                               48 of 108 
- The ex pansion cohort in 20 unselected relapsed or refractory AML patients  patients (“all-
comers ”)  
NOTE: At the time this protocol version 12.0 is running the expansion cohort in “all-
comers ”AML patients has been already completed with 23 patients enrolled.  
- An additional expansion cohort (“ IDH mutants” ) will enroll approximately 20 relapsed or 
refractory AML patients harboring an IDH mutation (either IDH1 or IDH2). 
The evaluable patients treated at the RD in  Part 1 or in Part 2 may be also retrospectively includ ed 
in exploratory safety/efficacy pooled analysis , including patients with  comparable inclusion 
criteria.  
Considering that IDH inhibitors are approved/available only in some of the participating countries, 
it is anticipated  that the study will enroll both IDH inhibitor pre -treated and IDH inhibitor naïve 
patients. For this reason, the recruitment will aim to have a balanced distribution across the two sub-populations to explore the differences in SEL24/MEN1703 activity  between pre-treated and 
IDH inhibitor naïve patients, if any.  
Retrospective correlations between the clinical activity of SEL24/MEN1703 and relevant disease markers (e.g. CD25 expression, FLT3 mutational status, IDH1/IDH2 mutational status, others) may be included in the statistical analysis plan.  
Subjects who have a suitable donor and achieve a response allowing them to undergo 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) per each institution ’s assessment can undergo HSCT 
without leaving the study. However, SEL24/MEN1703 should be stopped and a preHSCT visit 
should be performed prior to starting the conditioning regimen for HSCT. SEL24/MEN1703 can 
be resumed after stem cell transplantation if all the following conditions are met:  
• Subject is between [ADDRESS_939414]  
• Subject has had successf ul engraftment as demonstrated by [CONTACT_28763] 
(ANC) ≥ 500/mm3 and platelets ≥ [ZIP_CODE]/mm3 without transfusions  
• Subject does not have ≥ grade [ADDRESS_939415] disease  
• Subject is in CR , CRi, CRh 
Those subjects resuming treatment  will f ollow the procedures listed under subsequent Cycle 3 Day 
1 in the Assessments Schedule. Subjects who do not resume SEL24/MEN1703 will be followed 
for the applicable endpoints’ assessment .  
Finally, MRD status will be recorded  immediately  prior to the transplant and after the procedure 
whenever a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy will be collected  (recommended every 2 months unless 
differently indicated by [CONTACT_692618]’s parameters ). 
 
4.3. DLT Criteria  
DLT events for dose escalation decisions will be assessed to the end of Cycle [ADDRESS_939416] be conducted over 42 days.  Ongoing safety events  beyond Cycle 1 
will be reviewed across all cohorts during the study to help inform dose escalation decisions.

AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE V4.03. The AEs listed below will be considered 
as DLT unless they are clearly and incontrovertibly attributable to the underlying disease or to an extraneous cause :  
 
• Grade 5 toxicity  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥42 days from the start of the therapy cycle in absence of 
evidence of active AML (<5% blasts)  
• Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity, except:  
o Alopecia;  
o Grade 3 fatigue, asthenia, anorexia, fever, or constipation; 
o Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea not requiring tube feeding, TPN, or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; 
o Infection, bleeding, or other expected direct complications of cytopenias due to active leukemia; 
o Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte imbalances that respond to correction i.e. return to 
≤Grade 2, within 48 hours (h) from correction’s onset; 
o Grade 3 increase in aspar tate aminotransferase (AST)  and/or, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)  and/or alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  recovering ≤Grade 
2 within 7 days.  
Only clinically significant  abnormalities in laboratory findings, physical examination, vital signs, 
weight or ECG (see Section 7.2
) will be considered for DLT assessment, according to the protocol 
definition. 
 Please refer to Section 7.7.3
 for details of how to report DLT events. 
 
4.4. Criteria for Re-treatment and Dose Modification Rules  
The following sections describe the requirements for proceeding with treatment with SEL24/MEN1703 from Cycle 2 onwards, and the protocol rules for dose  modification due to 
toxicity.   
 From Cycle 2 onwards, each patient’s liver and renal function tests must return to the values 
required for entry into the study (Section 3.1
) or better, in order to continue treatment in the next 
cycle.  This requireme nt may be achieved by [CONTACT_43638] a dose delay as described below.  
 In the case of SEL24/MEN1703- related non -hematologic toxicity, the dose modification rules to 
be followed in both parts of t he study are presented in Table 10. No more than two dose reductions 
for toxicity will be permitted before withdrawal of study treatment.

 After Cycle 1, in case of hematologic toxicity the bone marrow status will guide the initiation of the next cycle according to Table 11 (NOTE: bone marrow examination may not be performed in 
case peripheral labs indicate persistence of disease):

judgement.  Deviations from the above guidelines are permitted to ensure safety and serve the best 
interest of the patient according to the assessment and judgement of the Investigator.  The reason 
for deviating from the guidelines should be documented in source documents. 
Dosing m
ay be withheld in the presence of non- drug related Grade 3 or 4 adverse event if the 
Investigator feels that it is unsafe to continue the administration of SEL24/MEN1703. 
In g
eneral, a patient who requires more than two dose reductions will be removed from the study 
unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient is experiencing a clinical benefit defined as achieving CR, CRi, CRh, PR or stable disease without unacceptable toxicities.  In such cases, a 
decision regarding the continuation of treatment with SEL24/MEN1703 and further dose 
reductions will be made on an individual basis in consultation with the medical monitor and the justification will be recorded in the source documents.  All dose modifications will be captured in 
the eCRF. 
Patient
s will be monitored for compliance throughout the study and may be withdrawn if 
considered to be non-compliant (see Section 3.4 ). In Part 1 (from Cycle 2 onwards only) and in 
Part 2, an extended  treatment delay e.g. of up to 14 days , may be  permitted on one occa sion, either 
before commencing a new treatment cycle or during a treatment cycle, for reaso ns unrelated to 
SEL24/MEN1703 toxicity where the Investigator considers the treatment delay to be exceptional 
and that it remains in the patient’s best interests to continue with SEL24/MEN1703. 
4.5. Intra -
patient D ose Escalation  
In Part 1, intra- patient dose escalation will be permitted per patient at the discretion of the 
Investigator, and in consultation with the DMC . The selected dose for the escalation step must

1, and the dose level does not exceed the MTD ). The patient s must also have completed [ADDRESS_939420] be obtained using the current version of the Patient
Information Sheet (PIS )/Informed Consent Form ( ICF) prior to commencing Screening. Patients
will attend the clinic for Screening assessments up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_939421] dose of SEL24/MEN1703. Due to the nature of the disease being studied, it is likely thatScreening assessments will in practice be carried out over a shorter time period.  The Final Study
Visit assessments will occur up to 30 days after the patient has discontinued SEL24/MEN1703
study treatment.  A final AE and concomitant medication review must take place [ADDRESS_939422] dose of SEL24/MEN1703. Follow up assessments will be conducted , wherever possible,
every 3 months after the Final Study Visit  regardless of initiation of additional treatments  for up
to 1 year  (or until End of Study, whichever occurs first).
The fol
lowing sections provide a detailed listing of study assessments by [CONTACT_765]. A summary of this 
information is also provided in Schedule of the Study Assessment (Table 5 ). 
Patien
ts will be required to visit the study sites for each study visit.  Permitted tolerance windows 
for specific study visits and assessments may apply and are described  in the Schedule of Study 
Assessment (Table 5 ) and in its footnotes . Where these are applied, the same tolerance windows 
may also be used for the entire study visit and all other assessment s scheduled to be conducted at 
that visit.  
5.1. Schedul
e of Study Assessments  
Each section below provides a summary of study assessments described by [CONTACT_765].  
Please also refer to the Schedule of Study Assessments (Table 5 ) and associated footnotes . 
Informed Consent must be obtained using the current version of the PIS/ICF prior to commencing Screening.  On dosing days, assessments should be performed prior to SEL24/MEN1703 dosing 
unless specified otherwise. Additional assessments may be conducted as clinically indicated.  
Where possible, patients will be followed up every 3 months for up to 1 year from their Final Study 
Visit regardless of initiation of additional treatments to check for disease progression and survival 
status.  This assessment may be made by [CONTACT_692634]’s 
routine clinic visits following completion of participation in the study. If the  patient  is lost to 
follow- up public databases can also be searched.  
The fol
lowing list of assessments is based on 14 days of SEL24/MEN1703 treatment in 21 -day 
cycles , further details, including possible exceptions for samples to be collected, are reported in  
the Schedule of Study Assessments (Table 5 ) and its footnotes.

5.3.6. Clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation , lipid profile  and urinalysis 
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation , lipid 
profile and urinalysis parameters will be taken at the times given in  the Schedule of Study 
Assessment (Table 5 ). The date and time of collection will be recorded in the source data and on 
the CRF. 
 All testing will be performed at each site’s local laboratory.  Patients  should be asked to follow 
local guidance for fasting prior to the lipid profile assessment.  At time points where coagulation 
testing is performed, these parameters may be assessed from the hematology sample.  Should a 
patient develop coagulation abnormalities at any point during the study, a comprehensive evaluation of coagulation abnormalities will be immediately performed which may  include, but 
not be limited to repeat PT/INR, APTT, fibrinogen, D -dimer, plus a peripheral blood smear, 
thrombin time . These abnormalities have to be  evaluated by [CONTACT_692635]’s medical history, physical examination and concomitant medication review. Repeat testing may be performed as clinically indicated, which may include additional parameters or time-points. Additional tests will be performed as required  to rule out other etiologies . 
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_692593].  
 The laboratory variables to be measured are described in  Appendix E
. 
 Results from the hematology test panel will contribute to each patient’s disease assessment (see Section 5.3.11
). 
 
5.3.7. Peripheral blasts  
Assessment of peripheral blasts will be part of the hematology panel at the time-poi nts specific in 
the Schedule of Study Assessment (Table 5 ). 
 
Results from these assessments will contribute to each patient’s disease assessment (see  
Section 5.3.11 ). 
 
5.3.8. Electrocardiogram s

5.3.10. Bone marrow as sessment  
A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (or biopsy where obtaining an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564655]), will be taken at 
the times specified in the Schedule of Study Assessment (Table 5 ). A local bone marrow 
differential assessment , to determine the % of different bone marrow cellular subpopulations, 
including the % leukemic blasts, will be conducted at Screening . In addition to the optional time 
points reported in the Schedule of Study Assessment, bone marrow  assessment is mandatory  at 
Screening and as soon as the peripheral lab results become consistent with an objective response. 
Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]/biopsy will be tested for the genetic profile of AML cells  (see Section 
5.3.13 ). An aliquot of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy will be centrally stored for future analysis ( e.g. 
minimal residual disease), if any.  
 
Results from these assessments will contribute to each patient’s disease assessment (see  
Section 5.3.11 ).  
 
5.3.11. Disease evaluation  
Evaluation of disease status will be performed at the time-points described in  the Schedule of Study 
Assessment (Table 5 ), according to the AML Response Criteria in Appendix D . 
 Disease assessment will involve evaluation of leukemic blast proportion in the bone marrow. Hematologic parameters from the routine local assessments including blast percentage (where applicable), platelet count, and other relevant parameters such as transfusion dependence will also contribute to this assessment.  
To note, disease assessment must be performed as soon as the peripheral lab results become consistent with an objective response. Disease assessment will also include an aliquot of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy that will be centrally stored for future analysis ( e.g. minimal residual 
disease), if any.  In case bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy is consistent with CRi or better response but 
still a minimal percentage of peripheral blasts is  detected, the response assessment can be 
postponed up to [ADDRESS_939443] bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_692582].  
5.3.12. PD biomarkers  
Evaluation of PD biomarkers will be performed at the time-points described in Schedule of Study Assessment (Table 5 ).

• Subjects are classified as baseline transfusion independent if there is no  red blood cells 
(RBC ) or platelet transfusions within the baseline period; otherwise, the subject is to be 
considered as baseline transfusion dependent.  
 
Post-baseline transfusion status:  
• Post-baseline period is defined as the period from [ADDRESS_939448] dose (day after C2D7) 
until last dose.  
• For subjects who are on treatment  ≥84 days (C5D1 or more), subjects are classified post -
baseline transfusion independe nt in the event of  [ADDRESS_939449] -baseline period  
• For subjects who are on treatment >28 days (C2D7) but <84 days (C4D21), post -baseline 
transfusion status is not evaluable  
• Otherwise, the subject is considered post- baseline transfusion dependent.  
Both transfusion conversion rate and maintenance rate apply to  subjects who ha ve evaluable post -
baseline transfusion status.  
Transfusion conversion rate is defined as the number of subjects who were transfusion dependent 
at baseline period but become transfusion independent at post -baseline period divided by [CONTACT_692639]. Transfusion maintenance rate is defined as the number of subjects  who were transfusion independent at baseline period and 
still maintain transfusion independent at post -baseline period divided by [CONTACT_692640].

6.4. Blinding and Procedures for Un -blinding the Study  
This is an open -label study, and there are no procedures for blinding and un-blinding. 
 
6.5. Provision and Replacement of SEL24/MEN1703 
Sufficient doses of SEL24/MEN1703 medication will be supplied. Where clinical supplies (or 
packaging) are apparently damaged on receipt or considered unfit for use by [CONTACT_3452], the Sponsor (or their delegate) must be notified immediately. Where required, clinical study  supplies 
will be replaced.  Further details on the handling of SEL24/MEN1703 at site will be described in 
the Pharmacy Manual.   
 
6.6. Drug Accountability  
The Investigator is obliged to keep sufficient documentation of the delivery, use and destruction or return of unused, used or partially used IMP. The documentation must include dates, quantities, 
patient numbers, batch numbers or other identification number. The Investigator may assign some 
or all of the Investigator’s duties for drug accountability to an appropriate pharmacist.  Roles and 
responsibilities of site staff will be recorded in the Investigator Site File.  The Investigator should maintain records that document adequately that the patients have been  
administered the doses specified in the protocol and reconci le all SEL24/MEN1703 received for 
the study . The local study monitor will be responsible for checking the drug accountability records 
maintained by [CONTACT_692642].  
 The medication provided for this study is for use only as directed in the protocol. It is the Investigator and their institution’s responsibility to establish a system for handling study drug so as to ensure that:

• such deliveries are recorded;  
• study treatments are handled and stored safely and properly as stated on the label;  
• study drug is only dispensed to study patients in accordance with the protocol; and  
• any unused study drug is destroyed locally or returned for destruction in liaison with 
the study monitor. 
 
Throughout the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage and any destroyed/returned stock  of SEL24/MEN1703. To help with compliance checks, r ecords of 
usage should include the identification of the patient to whom the study treatment was dispensed and the quantity and date of dispensing , plus all unused supplies at the end of each treatment cycle.  
Patients will be asked to maintain a dosing diary and bring it with them to study visits to support reconciliation and compliance checks. This record is in addition to any drug accountability 
information recorded on the eCRF. Any discrepancies must be accounted for on the appropriate 
forms. Certificates of delivery and return must be signed by [CONTACT_147636] e pharmacist, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_692596].  
 The return or destruction of unused drug will be conducted after written approval by [CONTACT_1034], with appropriate documentation and drug accountability procedures completed following destruction.  
6.7. Treatment Allocation  
In order to ensure that the appropriate numbers of patients are enrolled to each cohort in Part 1 and in Part 2, and that enrolment to the study is appropriately controlled, on identifying a potential study patient, the Investigator is  required to re gister a patient in the study. Patients will be 
registered in  the study by [CONTACT_624574] (IWRS) automated patient 
registration system (see the Study Operations Manual for specific instructions).  
Prior to registration  of Screening  in IWRS and any study -specific evaluations being performed, all 
patients must have given written informed consent for the study . Patients  must have completed the 
Screening  evaluations  and must meet all of the eligibility requirements listed in Section 3
 prior to 
being registered in the system as enrolled . Study drug will be assigned through the IWRS.  
 There will be regular communication with the sites during the study , in addition to the Cohort 
Review Meetings to ensure that Investigators are aware of enrolment status on the study  and of 
suitable times for patient enrolment.  
 
6.8. Dosing Instructions  
Patient s will be instructed to take their assigned SEL24/MEN1703 dose at regular intervals in th e 
morning on dosing days, swallowed  with water or an alternative drink . Doses sh all be taken on an 
empty stomach (at least 2 hours after and 1 hour before eating). P atients will be asked to record 
the exact time they take each dose, how many capsules they take, what they have eaten and drunk,

CLI24 -[ADDRESS_939451]  be informed that a SEL24/MEN1703 photosensitivity/phototoxicity effect cannot be 
excluded. For this reason, p atients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial 
sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) during the entire study p eriod. If patients need to be 
outdoors when taking SEL24/MEN1703, they should wear loose -fitting clothes that protect skin 
from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with the investigator . If a sunburn 
like reaction or skin eruption occurs, patients should contact [CONTACT_093] . 
 
6.9. Permitted and Restricted Concomitant Medications  
Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria (Section 3.2
) are not allowed during 
the ongoing study . If there is a clinical indication for any medication specifically prohibited during 
the study , discontinuation from study therapy may be required. The Investigator should discuss 
any questions regarding this with the assigned Medical Monitor for the stud y. The final decision 
on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the Investigator and/or the patient's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the patient on study treatment requires agreement from the Medical Monitor. 
 Note that use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents and growth factors during Cycle 1 is prohibited. 
Beyond Cycle 1, their use should be avoided; however, their use may be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor on a case- by-case basis.  
 
6.9.1. Acceptable concomitant m edications  
All treatments that the Investigator considers necessary for their patient’s welfare may be administered at their discretion in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_692597]. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the eCRF including all prescription, over-the-counter, herbal 
supplements, pre -medications, intravenous medications or  transfusions. Note that the assessment 
of red cell transfusions will be part of the disease assessment criteria (see Section 5.3.11
). If 
changes occur during the study  period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date 
may also be included on the eCRF.  All concomitant medications the patient received within [ADDRESS_939452] dose of SEL24/MEN1703 and [ADDRESS_939453] dose of SEL24/MEN1703 
should be recorded. Concomitant medications administered after [ADDRESS_939454] dose of 
SEL24/MEN1703 should be recorded for SAEs and any Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs) as 
defined in Section 7.10. 
 Sites should follow their institutional guidelines for treating hypophosphatemia, including administration of oral or I.V. phosphate supplements. Phosphate supplements should be started the 
same day any ≥Grade 3 hypophosphatemia is detected. Patients should be retested no less than 
every 24 hours , until phosphate levels are ≤Grade 2. SEL24/MEN1703 treatment may be reinstated 
per the retreatment guidelines provided in Section 4.4
. Lower grade abnormalities should be 
monitored and corrected as soon as possible. Additional assessments should be carried out as 
clinically indicated.

6.9.2. Antibacterial a nd antifungal prophylaxis  
Patients with grade 4 neutropenia should receive both antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis 
according to institutional guidelines, as long as grade 4 neutropenia persists. Commonly used prophylactic agents (fluoroquinolones, a zoles), with the exception of isavuconazole (not allowed, 
being a BCRP inhibitor) are not contraindicated, however careful clinical monitoring is recommended pending the clinical evaluation of potential for drug-drug interactions.  
6.9.3. Potential for drug -drug interactions  
Non-clinical drug interaction studies indicate that SEL24/MEN1703 may inhibit CYP2D6, and act 
as a substrate for CYP2D6 and BCRP. Between discontinuation of the following agents and the 
first administration of SEL24/MEN1703 (see Exclusion Criterion 16
), a 7-day washout period, or 
a period corresponding to 4-5 half- lives of the agents , is therefore mandated: 
 
• sensitive CYP2D6 substrates  
• CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range  
• strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors 
• BCRP inhibitors  
In addition, any drug which is a CYP2D6 substrate, a strong or moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6, or a BCRP inhibitor should not be administered concomitantly with SEL24/MEN1703 during the 
study . If a patient requires a drug in these categories, the Investigator should explore the use of an 
alternative therapeutic treatment/agent. If this is not possible, SEL24/MEN1703 should be 
discontinued and a 7 day washout period allowed before administration of the required ther apeutic 
agent commences.  Following discontinuation of SEL24/MEN1703 for this reason, treatment with 
SEL24/MEN1703 cannot re -start once treatment with the CYP2D6 substrate, or inhibitor of 
CYP2D6 or BCRP has stopped. Examples of relevant drugs to consider are provided below.  CYP2D6 substrates: 
• Sensitive CYP2D6 substrates: atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, 
metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine,  thioridazine, tolterodine, venlafaxine, 
nortriptyline 
• CYP2D6 substrate with narrow therapeutic range: thioridazine 
 
CYP2D6 inhibitors: 
• Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors:  quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] , 
dacomitinib m, ecstasy , terbinafine  
• Moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors: AMD070, cinacalcet, moclobemide, mirabeg ron, 
duloxetine, dronedarone , eliglustat, tipranavir/ritonavir, fluvoxamine, cimetidine  
 
BCRP inhibitors: 
• Representative BCRP inhibitors: cyclosporine, elacridar (GF120918), eltrombopag, 
gefitinib , curcumin , isavuconazole

CLI24 -[ADDRESS_939455] one dose of  SEL24/MEN1703 will be considered evaluable 
for safety. All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time the patient gives informed consent 
up to and including the 30 day follow up (Final Study Visit). There will be a baseline medical condition review taken at S creening. Event s, other than the primary disease under evaluation, that 
worsen in severity or frequency from this baseline assessment during the study, should be recorded and reported as AEs. 
7.2. Adv
erse Event Definition  
An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre -existing medical 
condition in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the IMP.  
The definition cover s also medication errors and uses outside what was foreseen in the protocol, 
including misuse and abuse of the product (see chapter 7.7.2). 
Adverse events include: 
• worseni
ng (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of conditions present at the start
of the study;
• intercurrent illness;
• drug interactions;
• experiences related or possibly related to concomitant medications;
• clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or shifts from baseline; and
• clinically significant abnormalities  in physical examination, vital signs, weight, or
ECG.
The Inv
estigator must record all the available information concerning any non -serious AE (whether 
or not deemed related to the study treatment) in the corresponding section of the eCRF -AE pages, 
within [ADDRESS_939456] knowledge of the occurrence of the event  
Progres
sion of the disease under study (i.e. AML) will not be captured as an AE. 
Surg
ical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves are not AEs, but the condition 
for which the surgery/intervention is required is an AE and should be documented accordingly. 
Plann
ed surgical measures and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the 
condition(s) was (were) known before the period of observation and did not worsen during study.  
In the latter case, the condition should be reported as medical history.

• the safety of study patients;  
• a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the investigational drug;  
• recognition of any dose- related investigational drug toxicity;  
• appropriate modification of study protocols; 
• improvements in study design or procedures as required; and 
• adherence to required ethical and regulatory requirements for clinical study conduct. 
 
7.4. Evaluating Adverse Events 
Following the patient’s written consent to participate in the study, all AEs should be collected.  All 
identified AEs must be recorded and described on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF, except for those events occurring prior to the first dose of study medication, which should be recorded on 
the Medical History eCRF page (unless related to the study procedures performed prior to dosing 
; in this case they  have to be reported as an AE) . Where known, the diagnosis of illness or disorder 
should be recorded, rather than listing individual symptoms.   The following information should be captured for all AEs: date of onset and resolution, severity of the event (see definitions in Section 7.5)
, assessment whether the event was serious or non -serious, 
Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_692598] (see definitions in Section 7.8) treatment required 
for the AE, action taken with IMP, and information regarding resolution/outcome. 
 
7.5. Severity  
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the AE page of the patient’s eCRF. Each event will be graded for severity using the classifications of NCI CTCAE v4.03  (see 
Appendix C
). For events not addressed in the NCI CTCAE v4.03, classifications the following 
grading will apply: 
 
• Mild (Grade 1)  - Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
• Moderate (Grade 2)  - Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living.  
• Severe (Grade 3)  - Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care activity of daily living.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4) - Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  
• Death (Grade 5) - Related to adverse event.  
 
7.6. Serious  Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose causes or qualifies as the 
following:

• Results in death.  
• Is life- threatening:  
o “Life -threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death at the 
time of the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]:  
o This means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692599] s of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692600] a consequence of the event.  
o Visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692601].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity:  
o “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means a permanent or significant and substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event:  
o Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised  in deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred. Important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692602]. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 Note -1: These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at the time the event occurs. 
For example, regarding a life- threatening event, this refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Any other AE/ADR which is not included in the above definitions will be considered as non serious.  Note -2: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692603] 24 hours or pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692604].

baseline, is chronically ongoing, stabilized, or is otherwise explained by [CONTACT_737].  
 If the In vestigator detects a SAE in a study patient after the end of the period of observation and 
considers the event possibly related to prior study treatment or procedures, they should immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) contact [CONTACT_692643]. For screening failure patients, SAEs detected after SF 
declaration will be recorded only if the event is considered as possibly related to study procedures.  
 
7.6.1. Exceptions to SAE  reporting  
For this study, the following events will be considered to be expected events in this population and 
during leukemia therapy other than SEL24/ MEN1703 (e.g. myelosuppression and events 
secondary to disease) and should not be reported to the Sponsor as serious events unless the Investigator considers any of these events to be clinically concerning and of unusual manifestation with regard to severity, dura tion, frequency, outcome or other characteristics of the event. It is 
important to note that these events (with the exception of progression of AML ), still need to be 
captured as AEs on the AE eCRF and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_692644].  
 Expected events during leukemia therapy are:  
 
• Myelosuppression due to disease or leukemia therapy  :  
o febrile or infection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . 
o epi[INVESTIGATOR_339112]. 
o anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, leukocytosis.  
• Events due to underlying disease:  
o symptoms associated with anemia: 
∼ fatigue. 
∼ weakness . 
∼ shortness of breath. 
o electrolyte abnormalities (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, CO
2, magnesium) . 
o chemistry abnor malities (LDH, phosphorus, calcium, BUN, protein, albumin, 
uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, glucose) . 
o coagulation abnormalities . 
o disease specific therapy (induction, maintenance, salvage, or stem cell therapy) . 
o alopecia. 
o bone, joint, or muscle pain . 
o liver function test abnormalities associated with infection or disease progression . 
o disease progression. 
• General therapy events :  
o events attributed to the use, placement and/or insertion of catheters . 
o renal failure associated with tumor lysis syndrome or antibiotic/antifungal 
therapy.

and clinical chemistry laboratory eCRFs. 
7.7. Othe
r Important Events for Immediate Reporting 
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not serious per 
ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements and the study needs.  
• a new can
cer (that is not a condition of the study);
• a reported pregnancy or lactation after receipt of study treatment and for up to [ADDRESS_939459] dose;
• an overdose (defined as any dose of SEL24/MEN1703 which is more than theassigned dose for that patient); or
• an AE which qualifies as a DLT during Cycle 1 for patients in Part 1 (see 
Section
7.7.3 ).
Such e
vents must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor via the eCRF. Once the information 
is saved in the eCRF, a notification e- mail will be automatically generated and sent to the Sponsor’s 
Study Drug Safety Unit (SDSU ). Only in case of breakdown of the eCRF System, the specific 
paper report form, provided to the sites, will be used. In such case, the Investigator will be 
responsible for sending the corresponding paper form and inserting the d ata in eCRF as soon as 
the system works again. The reporting procedures can be found in the SAE report form completion 
manual  distributed to the sites.   
7.7.1. Exp
osure during pregnancy or lactation  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered AEs, it is the responsibility of Investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a patient (spontaneously reported to them) or pregnancy in a patient’s partner that occurs during the study . 
Pregn
ancies and lactations that occur in patients after the ICF is signed but before starting 
study treatment must be reported by [CONTACT_692645]. Pregnancies and lactations that occur in  a study patient or a pregnancy in a 
patient’s partner from the time of first study treatment through to 30 days following cessation of SEL24/MEN1703 study treatment must be reported by [CONTACT_737].  All 
reported pregnancies must be followed to the com pletion or termination of the pregnancy.  
If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
Such ev
ents must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor.

Pregnancy and lactation will be reported to the Sponsor via EDC. ONLY if the eCRF 
system does not work, the specific paper report form (Pregnancy Exposure Report form ) 
will be completed and sent  to the Sponsor by  [CONTACT_137584] (see Section 7.7 ). The “Pregnancy 
Exposure Report ” form will be distributed to the sites to be used for this purpose. The 
outcome of the reported pregnancies will be always notified to the Sponsor using the 
Pregnancy Exposure Report form . If the pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome 
(miscarriage or ne w-born with congenital abnormality and/or stillbirth), this will be 
recorded in the eCRF as a SAE and managed as described in Section 7.10 . The reporting 
procedures can be found in the SAE report form completio n manual  distributed to the sites.   
 
7.7.2.  Misuse and overdose  
Both misuse and overdose issues should be reported to the Sponsor’s SDSU within the 
same timelines as a SAE, even if they may not result in an adverse outcome  (see Section 
7.7). In the event of overdose, the patient should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
 
For the purpose of this protocol, an overdose is any dose of SEL24/MEN1703 which is 
more than the assigned dose level for that patient.  The corresponding information should 
be entered on the overdose page in the eCRF  no later than 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_39722]. Once the page is completed and saved by [CONTACT_692646], an alert notification will be automatically sent to the Sponsor . ONLY if the  eCRF system does not 
work or if the eCRF is not available, the paper CRF-AE  report form shall be used  and sent 
to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_6968]. The reporting procedures are described in detail in the SAE report form completion manual  
distributed to the sites . 
In addition, if an AE (serious o non-serious) is associated with an overdose, it will be recorded on the AE page in  the e-CRF, recording the overdose details. 
 
If the pharmacy discovers that an overdose has or may have been administered, they should immediately contact [CONTACT_10552] (or their delegate).  
 
7.7.3.  Dose limiting toxicity  
DLT events for dose escalation decisions will be assessed at the end of Cycle 1  (and on 
Day 42 in the case of protracted neutropenia in the absence of active AML),  for each patient 
in each cohort and should be reported within [ADDRESS_939460] becoming aware of the event.  The AEs listed below will be considered as DLT 
unless they are clearly and incontrovertibly attributable to the underlying disease or to an extraneous cause:  
  
• Grade 5 toxicity  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥42 days from the start of the therapy cycle in 
absence of evidence of active AML (<5% blasts)  
• Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity, except:  
o Alopecia;  
o Grade 3 fatigue, asthenia, anorexia, fever, or constipation;

o Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea not requiring tube feeding, TPN, or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; 
o Infection, bleeding, or other expected direct complications of cytopenias due to active leukemia; 
o Grade 3 or 4 electrolyte imbalances that respond to correction i.e. return to 
≤Grade 2, within 48 hours (h) from correction’s onset; 
o Grade 3 increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  and/or, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)  and/or alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  recovering 
≤Grade 2 within 7 days. 
 
Only clinically significant  abnormalities in laboratory findings, physical examination, 
vital signs, weight or ECG (see Section 7.2
) will be considered for DLT assessment, 
according to the protocol definition.  
 
7.7.4. Investigational p roduct complaints 
Pharmaceutical technical complaints associated with the investigational product must be reported to the Sponsor immediately.  The same reporting timelines as for SAEs apply.  
 
7.8. Relationship 
All AEs (including SAEs) will be assessed for the relation ship of the AE to the study drug using 
the following standard definitions (for DLT events assessment for dose escalation decision please specifically refer to the above chapter 7.7.3) : 
 
• Not Related : The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE), with a tim e to drug 
intake with an unreasonable relationship and or non-plausibility  and/or the 
existence of a clear alternative explanation.  
• Unlikely related  - The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE), with a time to 
drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible). Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations. 
• Possibly related  - The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) has a reasonable 
time relationship to the drug intake, but it could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]. Information on drug withdrawal (dechallenge) may be lacking or unclear . 
• Probably related  - The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) has a  reasonable 
time relationship to the drug intake, it is unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent diseas e or other drugs and it follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge). Rechallenge (AE reappearance after drug reintroduction) is not required to fulfil this definition . 
• Definitely related  - The event or laboratory test abnormality (AE) has a plausible 
time relationship to the drug intake and it cannot be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically). The event must be defi nitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e. an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognised pharmacological phenomenon), using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary .

Please also refer to supporting information provided in Appendix C . The relationship of the study 
treatment to an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_692647].  
 For reporting and data analysis purposes, AEs reported with a causality  assessment of “Definitely”, 
“Probably”, and “Possibly” are to be considered as “having a reasonable causal relationship” to study drug. In case of disagreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, 
the more conservative assessment will determine the reportability of the case.  
 
7.9. Unexpected Adverse Events 
The Sponsor will assess all SAEs whether they are expected or unexpected.  An unexpected AE is 
any adverse drug event, the outcome, specificity, or severity of which is not consistent with that 
included  in the Reference Safety Information chapter of the current IB.  
 
7.10. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse events classified as serious require expeditious handling and reporting to the assigned  
Sponsor’s Study Drug Safety Unit (SDSU)  to comply with regulatory requirements , except for 
SAEs meet ing the “exceptions to SAE reporting ” definition (see Section 7.6.1).  
 For any SAE that occurs while a patient is on -study; within [ADDRESS_939461] study drug 
administration, regardless of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_122950]; or if any SAE that the Investigator considers as related to the study drug occurs later than [ADDRESS_939462] study drug administration, the Sponsor’s SDSU  must be notified immediately (within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the event). The procedure for reporting is via eCRF. Once the event is entered and saved on the AE page in the eCRF, an automatic alert notification will be sent to the Sponsor’s  SDSU. ONLY in case of 
eCRF system unavailability, the paper CRF- AE report form can be completed and the PDF sent to 
the Sponsor’s SDSU  by [CONTACT_692648]. As soon as the eCRF works again, 
the event should be recorded in the eCRF by [CONTACT_692649].

submitted to th e sites, RAs and ECs accordingly to the procedures described in the corresponding 
study Safety Management Plan (SMP).  
In addition, the Sponsor shall ensure that all relevant information about any S[LOCATION_003]R, will be 
expeditiously reported to the CAs (including EudraVigilance Clinical Trial Module ), and to ECs 
if applicable (as per country -specific requirements)  with the following deadlines after the first 
knowledge, intended as the day when the Sponsor’s receives the notification of the S[LOCATION_003]R or the monitor is a ware of it:  
• Fatal and life- threatening unexpected cases, no later than 7 days;  
• Other unexpected serious cases, no later than [ADDRESS_939463] to expedited management for the identification of possible necessary actions:  
• SAEs a ssociated with the study procedures;  
• Potential clinically significant findings emerging from non -clinical studies;  
• An anticipated end or suspension for safety reasons of another study with the same study treatment.  
 
When appropriate and applicable as p er local regulatory requirements, the Sponsor will arrange 
the adequate information also to the Investigators. The Sponsor (through the SDSU) will distribute the validated CIOMS I form to the investigators (via e- mail) with a safety letter.  
For the US, the  Investigator must ensure the study team is aware and comply with any additional 
local reporting requirements. For all SAEs that are related and unexpected, the Sponsor will assign a case number to be used in all future correspondence regarding the event and can provide an IND Safety Reports in MedWatch form or CIOMS form describing the event, for the Investigators to report to their Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Ethics Committee (EC) or other committee (as per local requirements).  Other SAEs (i.e. expected or unrelated SAEs) should be reported per the 
relevant institution’s procedures (if required). 
Where required, submission of Safety Updates by [CONTACT_692653].  Otherwise, perio dic safety reports to the regulatory 
agencies will be handled by [CONTACT_1034] (or their delegate).  These safety updates will also include 
SAEs that do not require expedited reporting to the authorities. 
In addition, a periodic line- listing of S[LOCATION_003]Rs occurred with SEL24/MEN1703 is to be reported to 
European Investigators (as per country requirements) every 6 months by [CONTACT_692654].  
Periodically (at least annually), the IB will be updated to include new and relevant safety 
information. Until such time that  an AE becomes identified in the IB, it should be considered 
unexpected for expedited reporting purposes

7.12. Follow Up I nformation on a SAE  
 
After the End of Study Visit, the Investigator is not requested to actively follow -up the patient 
unless ongoing SAEs are present . However, if after the end of the study, the Investigator becomes 
aware of any SAEs with a suspected causal relationship to the study treatment, th is SAE  should be 
duly reported to the Sponsor and recorded in the eCRF if still available. If the eCRF is not available  
anymore, the paper CRF SAE form will be used as a backup.  
 
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  Thus, follow -up 
information that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting docu mentation (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692605] /or autopsy reports), should be collected subsequently, if not 
available at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent using the same procedure as the 
initial SAE report.  The original SAE form must be kept on file at the study site.  The Sponsor will 
also review SAE reports for missing information and open  queries to the site for resolution as 
appropriate. 
 
Appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed and therapeutic measures, if indicated, should  be 
instituted.  Appropriate consultation and follow -up evaluations should be carried out by [CONTACT_3786] (or designee).  A SAE is followed until it is considered resolved, returns to baseline, is 
chronically ongoing, stabilized, or is otherwise explained by [CONTACT_737].

8.DATA EVALUATION
8.1. Data Mo
nitoring Committee
The DMC consists  of the Principal Investigators (or their representatives), the Medical Monitor , 
and Sponsor representatives. It may also include invited experts (such as a PK or PD data expert).  
During Part 1 the DMC will meet by [CONTACT_756] (or in person if possible) to review safety data from 
the first treatment cycle of the current cohort under evaluation.  The DMC will also convene 
periodically d uring Part 2, after every [ADDRESS_939464] been enrolled 
(whichever comes first), to consider ongoing safety and tolerability at the RD.  They will also 
consider PK and PD data as available and on -going safety data from prior cohorts. Appropriate 
representatives of the Sponsor and the coordinating personnel will also attend and minute the meeting.  Decisions of the DMC will be documented, filed in the eTMF, and will be distributed  to 
all study sites.  
Furt
her details on the composition of the DMC, as well as the process for data review and decision 
making, are described in the DMC charter for this study.  
The DMC
 will:  
• review
 the safety data from the first cycle of treatment for each cohort during Par t 1
and make dose- escalation decisions;
• consider other AEs, or possible trends in AEs, during Part [ADDRESS_939465] for Part 2;
• confirm the MTD or MAD and select the RD for further evaluation in Part 2;
• review the safety data package for Part 1; perform on -going assessment of safety, anti -
leukemic activity, PK and PD data in Part 2;
• support the implementation of supportive care guidelines during the study, by [CONTACT_692655];  consider these data both for DLT
evaluation, possible need for dose modification for individual patients, orrecommendation for withdrawal (see Section 3.4
).
8.2. Popu
lations 
Two populations for analysis are co nsidered: 
The dos
e determining set will consist of all patients in each cohort that have completed one cycle 
of treatment and patients that discontinued earlier due to a DLT occurring in this period. This population will be used for the dose escalation Part 1. 
For 
all other objectives,  the safety set consisting of all patients that have received at least one dose 
of SEL24/MEN1703 will be used. Patients will be also be categorized by [CONTACT_692656].  
For 
some objectives (e.g. anti-leukemic or PD activity) , a subgroup of patients of the safety set 
with respective baseline and post -baseline measurements will be used.

study drug. Study Completion is defined by [CONTACT_692657] (LPO) of the study i.e. when the last patient enrolled in the study has completed the last dose of study drug or discontinued for any reason and been followed up to the Final Study Visit.  End of Study is defined as the Final Study Visit of the last subject who discontinues the study 
treatment . 
 An addendum (or addenda) to the Clinical Study Report  will be generated as required to report any 
data obtained during the Follow- up Assessments.  
 
8.4. Statistical Considerations 
Detailed statistical analysis information will be provided separately in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). The SAP will detail all data handling rules, including the management of missing values 
and the handling of data for withdrawn patients. The SAP will also outline protocol deviation 
criteria. Any deviations to the planned analyses specified or populations defined within the SAP will be justified in writing and presented within the final clinical study report.  
 The clinical database lock will occur after all data are reconciled (i.e. “cleaned”) for all patients who participate in both Part [ADDRESS_939467] dose.  Part 1 will be reported together with Part 2. Where appropriate, those patients who 
received the same dose in Part 1 or Part 2  in both cohorts  may be combined and summarized, as 
well as being summarized separately.  The same is valid for the two cohorts, “a ll-comers” and 
“IDH -mutant s” patients . 
 
8.4.1. Missing data/discontinuation 
Due the dose escalation design of the study no missing imputation of missing values will be done 
for the primary objective. Reasons for discontinuation of the study and the study treatment will be listed and summarized.  
 
8.5. Demographic, Medical History, P rior Medication and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics, medical history,  prior medication and other baseline data will be 
listed and summarized using descriptive statistics for continuation data and contingency tables for categorical data. Prior medication will be summarized by [CONTACT_692658].

8.10. Methods for Assessment of PK Data  
The analysis plan for PK assessment for SEL24/MEN1703 in the study will be described in  the 
SAP.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated for each patient using a fully validated version 
of WinNonlin 8.0 (PhoenixTM, Pharsight®) or equivalent . The following parameters will be 
derived, where appropriate, from the individual plasma concentration versus time profiles of 
SEL24/MEN1703 and its metabolites.  PK analysis in urine will be described separately.

AUC 0-∞ The area under the concentration -time curve estimated from time zero to infinity as the 
sum of the 2 areas: AUC 0-t and AUC extrap, where AUC extrap is calculated as C t/λz. 
CL The systemic clearance calculated as: Dose/AUC 0-∞. 
Vss The apparent volume of distribution at steady state calculated as:  
Dose/AUC × (AUMC/ UC 0-∞ - t1/2). 
 Additional PK parameters may be calculated as appropriate.  
 
8.11. Methods for Assessment of PD Data  
The Sponsor will exploit flow cytometry for the analysis of relevant biomarkers (e.g. pS6). Since 
such investigation is of exploratory nature, the Sponsor may choose to prepare separate analysis 
plan and report for the PD analysis.

8.12. Methods for assessment of the genetic profile of AML cells  
The Sponsor will exploit Next Generation Sequencing and /or qRT- PCR  to analyze the genetic 
profile of AML cells . Since such investigation is of exploratory nature, the Sponsor may choose to 
prepare separate analysis plan and report for this analysis . 
8.13. Estim
ated Sample Size 
After completion of Part 1 (dose escalation) and definition of RD, approximately 4 0 evaluable 
patients  are to be enrolled in the Part 2, namely 20 patients in the ‘all comers’ and [ADDRESS_939470] 4 cohorts, 
then a 3+3 design had to be  followed from the former fifth cohort (150 mg dose level) onwards.  
However, following the occurrence of 2 DLTs at the 150 mg dose level, one of which resulted in 
a fatal treatment- related outcome, the study design has then been revised to follow a 3+[ADDRESS_939471] 3 patients in each dose level from 50 mg onwards . The final number of patients treated 
in Part 1  will therefore be dependent upon the number of cohorts (dose levels) investigated, as well 
as the number of cohort expansions. 
In P
art 1 a conventional algorithm will be used to identify the MTD or MAD, escalating on 0/3 or 
1/[ADDRESS_939472] 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experiencing a DLT. At the 150 mg dose cohort, up to 4  
additional patients will be treated with formulated IMP  according to a Bayesian modified toxicity 
probability interval (mTPI) with a target toxicity rate ≤ 25%. 
Part 
2 of the study further evaluate s safety and tolerability of SEL24/MEN1703 in AML population 
where there is rationale to treat.  The expansion cohort  in ‘all comers’  has already enrolled  23 
unselected AML patients . An additional expansion cohort (“IDH mutants”) will enroll 
approximately 20 relapsed or refractory AML patients harboring an IDH mutation (either IDH1 or IDH2) . 
Considering that IDH inhibitors are approved/available only in some of the participating countries, it is anticipated  that the study will enroll both IDH inhibitor pre -treated and IDH inhibitor naïve 
patients. For this reason, the recruitment will aim to have a balanced distribution across the two sub-populations to explore the differences in SEL24/MEN1703 activity  between pre-treated and 
IDH inhibitor naïve patients, if any.

9.1. Dat
a recording  / Monitoring of the Study and Regulatory Compli ance
The project manager, or their designee, will make an initiation site visit to each institution to review the protocol and its requirements with the Investigator(s), inspect the drug storage area, and fully 
inform the Investigator of his/her responsibilities and the procedures for assuring adequate and 
Menarini Ricerche S.p.A.  
 Confidential  
 
CLI24 -[ADDRESS_939473] documentation.  During the initiation site visit the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and 
other pertinent study materials will be reviewed with the Investigator’s site staff. During the course 
of the study, the monitor will make regular site visits in order to review protocol compliance, 
examine eCRFs and individual patient ’s medical records and assure that the study is being 
conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.  All eCRF entries will be verified with 
source documentation. The review of medical records will be done in a manner to assure that patient confidentiality is maintained.  
 All eCRF data will be collected using an eCRF within a fully validated and CFR 21 Part 11–
compliant Electronic data capture system.  The Investigator’s site staff will be responsible for 
entering study data into the eCRF in accordance to the eCRF Completion Guidelines provided by [CONTACT_2728].  All data shall  be entered into the eCRF by [CONTACT_24342]’s site staff  as closely as 
possible to the time when they become available and not later than 10 business days. These data 
will then be source -data verified and reviewed by [CONTACT_522671] (CRAs) before 
data cleaning by [CONTACT_692660]. All queries will be raised and resolved within 
the electronic data capture system.  During entry, programmatic checking of the data will be 
performed and, once saved into the database, more complex programmatic checks will also be performed. During the conduct of the study, all system users will have real -time access to the data.  
The level of access to the data and study privileges will be determined by [CONTACT_219541].  
 After all queries have been resolved, the SAP approved and signed, and any summary/analysis 
populations approved, the database will be locked and the data released for summary and analysis.  
All summary and analysis of the data will be performed using appropriate version of SAS
® and 
WinNonLin 8.0, or equivalent.  
9.2. Study Monitoring  
Study Monitors will be responsible for the monitoring of the study.   The Study Monitor will review the progress of the study on a regular basis to ensure adequate and accurate data collections.  Monitoring site visits to review eCRF, patient case notes, administrative 
documentation, including the Investigator Site File, and frequent telephone/e- mail 
communications with site will be performed throughout the study.  At each study monitoring visit, the Investigator will make available all records pertaining to the study.  To allow sufficient time to assemble documentation for the Study Monitor, monitoring visits 
will be confirmed in advance of planned visits.  
 
9.3. Clinical S tudy Audit 
The Sponsor, Sponsor representative or external regulatory agency may at any time during or after 
completion of the study conduct a GCP audit. Prior notice will be given to each site selected for 
audit in advance of a planned audit.

9.5. Data R etention and Availability  
The Investigator is required to maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_219480], including the 
Investigator Site File, a disc containing all eCRF data (including the full audit  trail and all data 
queries), signed informed consent forms, and records for the receipt and disposition of study medications, must be retained for at least 25 years after the end of the clinical study, unless other 
EU laws require archiving for a longer period.  These documents should be retained for a longer 
period, however, if required by [CONTACT_692661]. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 During the study, the Investigator must make study data accessible to the Study Monitors, the Sponsor (or a third- party auditor assigned by [CONTACT_1034]), and relevant IEC/IRBs and Regulatory 
Agencies.  A file for each patient must be maintained that includes the signed informed consent 
form and all source documentation related to that patient.  The Investigator must ensure the 
availability of source documents from which the information in the eCRF was derived.  
 
9.6. Curricula Vitae and Financial Disclosure of Investigators  
All Principal Investigators will be required to provide a current signed and dated curriculum vitae, a completed FDA Form 1572 (required in the [LOCATION_003]; in the EU, if applicable) and a financial disclosure statement (required in the [LOCATION_003]; in the EU, if applicable) . All Sub- investigators will be 
required to provide a current curriculum vitae and a financial disclosure statement . 
 
9.7. Protocol Modifications  
No modification of the protocol should be implemented without the prior written approval of the 
Sponsor. Any such changes which may affect a patient’s treatment or informed consent, especially 
those increasing potential risks, must receive prior approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  The exception to this 
is where modific ations are necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patient s, or when 
the change involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g. change in monitor, 
change in telephone number). Other administrative revisions which may impact the clinical portion 
of a study will be duly reported to the IRB/IEC by [CONTACT_079].

The Inv
estigator will obtain written informed consent from each patient, or their authorized 
representative, participating in the study.  The form must be signed, witnessed and dated. The 
informed consent form will contain all the Essential Elements of Informed Consent set forth in 
[ADDRESS_939474] regulations (HIPAA), the 
US Common Rule (45 CFR 46.116) , the  EU Regulations 536/2014 and 679/2016 as applicable . 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_692606] g iven to the patient and filed in the Investigator’s study 
file, as well as the patient’s medical record if in conformance with the institution’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)  and the applicable Laws and Regulations .  
The fi
nal study protocol and pa tient informed consent form will be appr oved by [CONTACT_5269]/IRB  for each investigational site.  Approval will be received in writing before initiation of the 
study.  
Changes
 to the protocol during the study will be documented as amendments.  Depending on the 
contents of the amendment and local legal requirements, the amendment will be submitted for approval to the relevant IEC/IRBs and to the relevant competent authorities prior to implementation.  Exceptions are cases of changes made to protect patient safety, which will be 
implemented immediately.  
If an
 amendment substantially alters the study  design, increases the potential risk to the patients, 
affects the treatment of the patient, or might otherwise influence the willingness of the patient to participate in the study , then the information sheet must be revised and submitted to the relevant 
IEC/IRB and, where necessary, to the relevant competent authorities, for review and approval.  
When a patient is currently undergoing study  procedures and is affected by [CONTACT_29991], then 
the patient must be asked to consent again using the new information sheet.  
10.1. Ethic
al Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki, the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 
when it will come into force,  the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC, the requirements of local IEC/IRB, 
and the US Code of Federal Reg ulations, Title 21 CFR Part 50.  Relevant updates to these 
regulations will be implemented as they come into force.  
10.2. Infor
med Consent  
The principles of informed conse nt in the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP guidelines will be 
implemented before any protocol-specific procedures or interventions are carried out.  
All 
patients will be informed that their participation  is voluntary and that they can cease 
participation at any time without necessarily giving a reason and without any penalty or loss of benefits to which they are entitled.

With the help of the information sheet the patient will be informed about the IMP(s) and anticipated 
effects  and the reason, design, and implication of the study . The patient must give consent to 
participate prior to enrolment in the study. This consent must be given in writing.  The Investigator 
who conducts the informed consent discussion must also sign. The Inv estigator may delegate this 
responsibility to a suitably qualified member of the study team (e.g. Sub -Investigator) if permitted 
by [CONTACT_427].  This delegation of responsibility must be recorded in the Study File.  By [CONTACT_692662], the patient will confirm that his or her participation is voluntary and that he or she will follow the instructions of the Investigator and answer the questions asked.  Signatures must be 
personally dated.  
 The signed and dated consent form will be securely  kept by [CONTACT_737].  Prior to participation 
in the study , the patient should receive a copy of the signed and dated written informed consent 
form.   The consent form and information sheet must include all elements required by [CONTACT_2371], local regulations, GCP and ICH guidelines including consent to allow the Sponsor, Sponsor representative, or external regulatory auditor to review the patient’s medical records.  This gives 
permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and reports that are importan t 
to the evaluation of the study.  
 Any party with direct access must take all adequate reasonable precautions within the constraints 
of the applicable regulatory requirement(s) to maintain the confidentiality of the patients’ identities and Sponsor’s proprietary information.  It is the CRA’s responsibility to verify that each patient has 
consented, in writing, to direct access  and that the documents are safely archived .

12.6. Data Breach  
Data Breach is data breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, 
alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise 
processed. In particular: destruction of personal data is where the data no longer exists, or no longer exists in a form that is of any use to the Sponsor, Site, CRO and Investigator etc.; data 
loss is when the data may still exist, but the Sponsor, Site, CRO and Investigator etc. has lost 
control or access to it, or no longer has it in its  possession; damage is where personal data has 
been altered, corrupted, or is no longer complete; data unavailability is where, following a data incident (such as a network outage, a natural or man - made disaster, etc.), personal data become 
temporarily inaccessible to the Sponsor, Site, CRO and Investigator etc.  
Whoever becomes aware in any way of a Data Breach (see definitions above) affecting  the 
patients’ personal data and/or personal data collected in the context of the study, shall, as appropriate, immediately (and in any case no later than 24 hours from the knowledge  of a Data 
Breach) inform the study manager , the Sponsor’s Data Protection Officer, who may be contact[CONTACT_299209] [EMAIL_8526] , the Site and the CRO at [EMAIL_13233] and shall provide the 
following information if known: 
(i) Data Breach Type (e.g. data loss, unauthorized access, loss of company devi ce, etc.);  
(ii) Person or source that first reported the Data  Breach;  
(iii)Date and Time when the person who first reported the Data Breach became aware of it;  
(iv) Data Breach Date and Time (actual or presumed); 
(v) Place (specify if actual or alleged) where the Data Breach occurred  ; 
(vi) Data Breach Description;  
(vii) Indicate the source of the Data Breach (e.g. I.P. source) - (if relevant);

(xi) Amount of allegedly breached  data; 
(xii) Other relevant  information. 
 
Once all the above information have been provided, the Sponsor and/or the Site should  have a 
reasonable degree of certainty that a security incident has occurred that has led to personal data 
being compromised. 
Then, as appropriate, Sponsor and Site, each one in its respective remit, sh all manage the  Data 
Breach in accordance with the applicable data protection  regulations. 
For Data Breach affecting personal data of patients enrolled within the European Union, Sponsor 
and the Site autonomously or jointly -depending on the circumstances a nd their privacy 
responsibilities as defined by [CONTACT_444864] 679/2016- shall : 
1. collect the necessary evidence and  information;

APPENDIX C:  SUPPORTING INFORMATION FOR ASSESSMENT OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 can be found at the website of the National Cancer Institute.  
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE 
 The following table provides supporting information to assess the relationship of AEs with study (test) drug. 
1 Not related  This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.).  
2 Unlikely  
(must have two)  In general, this category can be considered applicable to those adverse events which, 
after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be 
unrelated  to the test drug.  An adverse event may be considered unlikely if or when:  
1. It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test 
drug. 
2. It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
3. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
4. It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.  
3 Possibly  
(must have two)  This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the test drug 
administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  An adverse 
event may be considered possibly relat ed if or when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test drug.  
2. It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental 
or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
3. It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
4 Probably 
(must have three)  This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to 
be related to the test drug.  An adverse event may be considered probably related if or 
when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test drug.  
2. It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_523699] s of the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered 
to the patient.  
3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  There are important 
exceptions when an adverse event does not disappe ar upon discontinuation of the drug, 
yet drug- relatedness clearly exists (e.g., bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, 
tardive dyskinesia).  
4. It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
5 Definitely  
(must have all)  This category applies to those adverse events which, the Investigator feels are 
incontrovertibly related to test drug.  An adverse event may be assigned an attribution 
of definitely related if or when:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of t he test drug.  
2. It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered 
to the patient.  
3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reducti on in dose with re -exposure to drug.  
(Note:  this is not to be construed as requiring re -exposure of the patient, however, a 
category of definitely related can only be used when a recurrence is observed.)  
4. It follows a known pattern of response to the te st drug.

APPENDIX D:  AML RESPONSE CRITERIA  
 
Category Definition  Comment  
Response# 
CR without minimal residual  
disease (CR MRD -) If studied pretreatment, CR with 
negativity for a genetic marker  
by [CONTACT_937] -qPCR, or CR with negativity 
by [CONTACT_692678], 
and by [CONTACT_692679]; therefore, test used and 
sensitivity of the  
assay should be reported; analyses 
should be done  
in experienced laboratories 
(centralized diagnostics)  
Complete remission (CR)  Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence 
of circulatin g blasts and  
blasts with Auer rods; absence of 
extramedullary disease;  
ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL); 
platelet count ≥100 x 109/L 
(100 000/µL)  MRD+ or unknown  
CR with incomplete  
hematologic recovery  
(CRi) Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence 
of circulating blasts  and 
blasts with Auer rods ; absence of 
extramedullary disease with 
incomplete  recovery of peripheral 
blood counts (ANC  < 1.0 × 109/L 
[1000/ µL] or platelet  
count < 100 × 109/L [100 000/ µL])  
 
CR with partial hematologic 
recovery (CRh )10, 11 Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence 
of circulating blasts  and 
blasts with Auer rods ; absence of 
extramedullary disease with partial 
recovery of peripheral blood counts 
(ANC > 0.5 × 109/L [500/ µL] and 
platelet  count > 50 × 109/L [50 
000/µL])  
Morphologic leukemia -free 
state (MLFS)  Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence 
of blasts with Auer rods;  
absence of extramedullary disease; 
no hematologic recovery  
required  Marrow should not merely be 
“aplastic”; at least [ADDRESS_939479]  10%  
Partial remission (PR)  All hematologic criteria of CR; 
decrease of bone marrow blast  
percentage to 5% to 25%; and 
decrease of pretreatment  
bone marrow blast percentage by [CONTACT_12697] 50%  Especially important in the context 
of phase 1 -2 clinical  
trials

Primary refractory disease  No CR or CRi after 2 courses of 
intensive induction treatment;  
excluding patients with death in 
aplasia or death due to  
indeterminate cause Regimens containi ng higher doses 
of cytarabine are generally 
considered as the best option  
for patients not responding to a first 
cycle of 7+3; the  
likelihood of responding to such 
regimens is lower  
after failure of a first  
Death in aplasia  Deaths occurring  ≥7 d following 
completion of initial treatm ent 
while cytopenic; with an aplastic or 
hypoplastic bone marrow  
obtained within 7 d of death, 
without evidence of persistent  
leukemia   
Death from indeterminate 
cause  Deaths occurring before completion 
of therapy, or <7 d  
following its completion; or deaths 
occurring ≥[ADDRESS_939480] -, CR, CR i, PR, 
MLFS; and criteria for PD not met  Period of stable disease should last 
at least 3 mo  
Progressive disease (PD)*,†  Evidence for an increase in bone 
marrow blast percentage  
and/or increase of absolute blast 
counts in the blood:  
• >50% increase in marrow 
blasts over baseline (a 
minimum 15% point 
increase is required in 
cases with <30% blasts at 
baseline; or persistent 
marrow blast percentage of 
>70% over at least 3 mo; 
without at least a 100% 
improvement in ANC to an 
absolute level (>0.5 x 
109/L [500/ µL], and/or 
platelet count to >50 x 
109/L [50 000/ µL] 
nontransfused); or  
• >50% increase in 
peripheral blasts (WBC x 
% blasts) to >25 x 109/L 
(>25 000/ µL) (in the 
absence of differentiation 
syndrome)†; or  Category mainly applies for older 
patient given low  intensity or 
single -agent “targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]” in 
clinical trials.  
In general, at least [ADDRESS_939481] 4 wk ap art; the 
date of progression should then be 
defined as of the first observation 
date.  
Some protocols may allow transient 
addition of hydroxyurea to lower 
blast counts.  
“Progressive disease” is usually 
accompanied by a decline in ANC 
and platelets and increased 
transfusion requirement and decline 
in performance status or increase in 
symptoms.

Relapse  
Hematologic relapse  
(after CR MRD -, CR, CR i, CRh)  Bone marrow blasts ≥5%; or 
reappearance of blasts in the 
blood; or development of 
extramedullary disease   
Molecular relapse  
(after CR MRD -) If studied pretreatment, 
reoccurrence of MRD as assessed 
by 
[CONTACT_937]-qPCR or by [CONTACT_692680], sensitivity of the 
assay, and cutoff values used must 
be reported; analyses should be 
done in

*The authors acknowledge that this new provisional category is arbitrarily defined; the category aims at harmonizing 
the various definitions used in different clinical trials.  
†Certain targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], for example, those inhibiting mutant IDH proteins, may cause a differentiation syndrome, that is, a transient increase in the percentage of bone marrow blasts and an absolute increase in blood blasts; in the 
setting of therapy with such compounds, an increase in blasts may not necessarily  indicate PD.
# In case bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy  is consistent with CRi  or better but still a minimal percentage of peripheral blasts is detected, the 
response assessment can be postponed up to [ADDRESS_939482] bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_692582].

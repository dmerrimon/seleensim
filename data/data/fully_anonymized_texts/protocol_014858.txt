2008- [ADDRESS_555753]  
Although cancer vaccines offer significant promise, clinical effectiveness has yet to be realized.  
Effective vaccines may require inclusion of basic elements of the immune response which allow 
successful elimination of pathogens.  It is now clear that str ong adaptive immune responses are 
preceded by a potent innate immune response, triggered by [CONTACT_209058]-associated molecular 
patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by [CONTACT_438545] -like receptors (TLRs).  In 
the absence of TLR signaling, release of inflammatory cytokines by [CONTACT_438546]-
optimal, likely explaining why tumors are poor at eliciting antigen-specific adaptive immunity. Harnessing and adapting the mechanisms used by [CONTACT_438547] a very promising approach to improving antigen-specific antitumor immune 
responses.    The plasmacytoid dendritic cell, the primary producer of type I interferons in the 
body, is a central mediator of inflammation in response to TLR activation and coordi nates 
immune cell interactions which lead to a potent adaptive immune response.  This inflammatory response is important not only to trigger strong T -cell priming, but also to induce inflammation at 
the target site which leads to enhanced T-cell migration and effector function.  In our murine 
models, we have found that plasmacytoid dendritic (pDC) cells can lead to enhanced antigen-
specific immune responses, partially through synergy with myeloid dendritic cells (mDC).  In addition, we and others have found that pDC can be activated directly in vivo through specific 
toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.  In this proposal, we will test these concepts in melanoma 
patients and will utilize a vaccine in combination with a TLR agonist capable of activating both 
pDC a nd mDC in order to model the synergy observed in our murine system.  We will measure 
T-cell priming in patients immunized in the presence or absence of TLR activation.  Subsequent 
to T-cell priming, we will administer the TLR agonist at the tumor site in o rder to induce 
inflammation at sites of cutaneous metastases and will test the ability of this intervention to 
activate pDC at the tumor site and enhance T-cell migration into the tumor and T-cell effector 
function.  Our goal is to identify principles whic h may be generalized towards improving cancer 
vaccines against other common cancers.  
1.0  Objectives 
  1.1  Primary Objective 
To compare the ability of vaccines in combination with TLR stimulation at the site 
of vaccine (R848; Resiquimod) to vaccines alone  in the ability to enhance the 
generation of circulating antigen-specific T -cells (T -cell priming).  
 
  1.[ADDRESS_555754] (R848 gel) to 
activate innate immune cells at the gp100 (g209-2 M) vaccine site.  
   B.   To evaluate the ability of R848 gel, administered at the tumor  
                             site, to: 
 i.   Induce inflammation and upregulation of adhesion molecules on tumor 
vasculature  
ii.   Enhance T-cell infiltration into tumor  
iii.  Generate T-cells against additional tumor antigens, not  present in the 
vaccine (i.e., antigen spreading).  
iv. Mediate clinical response with measure of objective tumor response rate and 
progression free survival. 
2008- [ADDRESS_555755] shed much light on why viruses and other pathogens can elicit such 
potent and effective natural immune responses. We believe that harnessing and 
adapting the mechanisms used by [CONTACT_438547] a very promising approach to improving specific antitumor 
immune responses.  
 
2.2  Activation of  innate immunity is critical for the generation of effective 
adaptive immune responses 
Effective antiviral immune responses are initiated through activation of innate 
immune cells, including NK cells, conventional myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), 
and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), by [CONTACT_438548] 11-13.  Activation 
of innate immunity induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines which 
can directly activate cells important for the initiation of adaptive immune responses.  Type I interferons (IFNs) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-β), for 
example, are potent inducers of mDC maturation, inducing upregulation of major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and costimulatory molecules as well as 
production of IL-12, both of which are important for the priming of naïve T cells 
14,15.  In addition, the activation of NK cells by [CONTACT_438549], cytokines and TLR ligands 
may lead to increased lysis of virally -infected cells or tumors which, in turn, can 
provide antigen to mDCs for presentation to T cells.  Activation of innate

 immunity is important not only for the generation of antigen-specific T- cells, but 
also to induce inflammation at the pathogen site which leads to enhanced 
migration of antigen-specific T- cells to the infected tissue.  
2.3  Plasmacytoid DCs represent a critical link  between innate and adaptive immunity  
A
s the major producer of type I IFNs (represented by [CONTACT_20129] - and IFN -
)
, pDCs  
represent one of the most important links between innate and adaptive immunity 
16-20. Upon triggering of TLR7 or TLR9 by [CONTACT_166193], pDCs rapi[INVESTIGATOR_438538] I IFNs, activate a variety of immune cells such as B cells, natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, and differentiate into antigen presenting cells (APCs) to induce antigen-specific T cell responses 
21. Both 
mDCs and NK cell activation can also be partially mediated by [CONTACT_39764] I interferons.  IFNRc -/- mDCs are defective in the ability to adequately respond to viral 
infections 
22, suggesting that interferon-producing pDCs may be critical for the 
activation of mDCs and subsequent development of adaptive immunity.  A 
number of lines of evidence suggest that 
pDCs may interact with mDCs to induce an 
enhanced adaptive immune response in the development of antiviral immunity 
23-25. 
Activa tion of mDCs by [CONTACT_438550] - 
22,25-27. In 
addition, HIV was found to be able to activate pDC, which could subsequently activate mDC upon co-culture 
24. In addition, it has been 
recently demonstrated that pDCs may interact with lymph node mDCs in the generation of 
anti-HSV CTL

2.[ADDRESS_555756] the ability to increase the levels of circulating T-cells capable of 
recognizing tumor antigens.  However, this 
has not led to significant tumor regressions in patients.  For example, an analysis of the response rate in over 500 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with vaccines 
was under 3%.
29   Our hypothesis is that this 
is due to inadequate activation of innate 
immunity at the site of immunization as well 
as at the tumor site itself.  Lack of adequate 
inflammation at the vaccine site may lead to suboptimal T-cell priming, while equally

 important; the lack of inflammation at the tumor site may lead to inefficient migration of 
T-cells  back to the tumor. 
 
 
2.5  Plasmacytoid dendritic cells and myeloid dendritic cells synergize in their ability 
to generate antigen specific immune reactions, resulting in an enhanced antitumor response in vivo  
We hypothesized that by [CONTACT_438552], pDCs would potentiate the function of mDCs when used in combination. Indeed, when purified 
murine pDCs and mDCs were co-cultured in the presence of antigen and a TLR 
activation stimulus, s uch as CpG, followed by [CONTACT_438553], antigen-specific T-
cell levels were higher than with the administration of either DC subset alone (figure 1).  Since the total number of DCs was kept constant for all groups, the interaction between 
pDC and m DC in their ability to stimulate T-cells was synergistic and not simply additive.   
Importantly, tumor reduction was also enhanced when mice were treated with the 
combination of activated, antigen-pulsed pDC and mDC compared to either DC 
subset alone (Figure 2).  Treatment of tumors with a combination of pDC and 
mDC resulted in mice with both smaller tumors (Figure 2A) and enhanced survival (Figure 2B).  
 
Since pDC and mDC synergize in the generation of antigen-specific T- cells, we 
propose to use a TLR agoni st, R848, which is capable of activating both pDC 
and mDC through TLR 7 and 8, respectively, in combination with vaccine in order to induce antigen-specific T-cells in melanoma patients.  
 2.6  TLR agonists can activate pDC and mDC and can induce inflammation 
 
        a. R848 (Resiquimod)  
Resiquimod (also known as R -848) is a novel heterocyclic amine  that acts as a 
dual TLR7 and TLR8 agonist and therefore is capable of activating both 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which express TLR7, and myeloid dendritic 
cells (mDC), which express TLR8.  Resiquimod is a member of the 
imidazoquinoline family of IRMs, of which imiquimod has been most extensively 
characterized (and is in active clinical use for the treatment of actinic keratosis 
and basal cell cancer).  Resiquimod is consistently more potent than imiquimod 
(50-100 fold) based on median minimum concentration required to elicit a 3-fold 
increase in IFN -α, TNF- α, and IL-[ADDRESS_555757] skin of the 
upper arm (1246-R848), with a maximum exposure of 2.5mg (1gm of 0.25% gel) 
2x/week for 3 weeks, dose-related , but tolerable, systemic adverse effects 
consistent with systemic cytokine induction were observed.  These included fever, chills, and transient neutropenia.  Application site reactions including erythema, stinging, and pruritis were also observed.  Dose-related increases in local cytokine production and T-cell infiltration were also reported. 
     
Because the 0.25% dose provided the highest level of immune cell infiltration, we will plan to utilize a dose of 0.2% R848 2 times per week in our study (currently, this is the highest clinical grade formulation available), with the option of dose reducing to [ADDRESS_555758] found that TLR agonists, given at the site of vaccine, can enhance the generation of antigen-specific T-cells (T -cell priming).    
 2.7  TLR 7/[ADDRESS_555759]   gp100(g209-2M)  
While activated pDC at the site of immunization resulted in enhanced T-cell 
priming, use of purified activated pDC would be challenging in the clinic due to 
the extensive and personalized nature of the preparation.  Although interferon-  
is a major mediator of the effects of pDC, it is clear from our studies that cell -cell 
contact [CONTACT_438554].  
Therefore, we have focused on the use of toll-like receptor agonists capable of 
activating pDC in vivo.  Because our preliminary data indicates that activated pDC and mDC synergize in the priming of 
specific T-cells, we have selected a novel 
molecule, Resiquimod (R848), which stimulates both TLR [ADDRESS_555760] administered naïve pmel T-cells, which are transgenic to express a T-cell receptor specific for the gp100(g209-2M) antigen.  We found that administration of R848 gel over a vaccine site using the melanoma 
antigen gp100(g209-2M) enhances the 
proliferation of gp100(g209-2M).   Specific 
pmel T-cells compared to the vaccine alone (Figure 3).  
 
Besides enhancing T-cell priming, we have found that the administration of TLR agonists at the tumor site induces pDC activation, and subsequent T-cell infiltration, tumor regression, and generation of T-cells against other (“de novo”) antigens.

2008-[ADDRESS_555761] administration results in activation of pDC at the tumor site. 
To determine the ability of TLR agonists to activate pDC at the tumor site, 
Resiquimod (R848) or CpG, capable of 
activating pDC through TLR 7 or TLR 9, respectively, was injected intratumorally and 24 hours later tumor was harvested and pDC were evaluated by [CONTACT_8315]. Intratumoral injection of both 
Resiquimod and CpG resulted in pDC activation, as determined by [CONTACT_398]86 expression (Figure 4 ).  Similar results 
were seen using CD40 as a marker of pDC activation (not shown). 
 
Having demonstrated that administration of TLR agonists resulted in pDC activation at the tumor 
site, we next studied whether this led to enhanced infiltration of T-cells into the tumor.  To study 
this, mice bearing subcutaneous B16-ova melanoma tumors were injected with naïve pmel T-
cells, which express a T- cell receptor specific for the gp100(g209-2M) melanoma antigen, 
expressed by B16 tumor.  Use of the pmel system allows the tracking of vaccine-induced 
lymphocytes in vivo, as well as the simulation of the circulating levels of T-cells we find in 
patients following immunization.   Mice  were then immunized with gp100(g209-2M)   peptide in 
IFA.  TLR activation at the tumor site was performed by [CONTACT_438555].  Five days later, tumors were harvested and the percentage of Pmel and ova-specific T-
cells were enumerated by [CONTACT_4133].  Pmel T-cells could be distinguished from 
endogenous T-cells by [CONTACT_438556] 1.1.  This experiment allowed us 
to determine whether TLR activation at the tumor site increased vaccine induced gp100(g209-
2M) specific T-cells as well as non- vaccine induced T-cells against a de novo antigen (ova in 
Fig. 5.  Intratumoral TLR triggering enhances accumulation and anti -tumor effect of vaccine -induced and de novo induced tumor -

were found to infiltrate tumors only in mice receiving TLR activation at the tumor site (Fig 5a).  
Moreover, using tetramer analysis, endogenously derived ova-specific T- cells were found in 
high numbers in tumors receiving TLR activation compared to those that did not (Fig 5b). This 
suggests that TLR activation at the tumor site results in increased accumulation of vaccine-
induced T-cells, as well as c ross-priming of endogenous T-cells against other antigens present 
in the tumor.  Finally, mice receiving a combination 
of vaccine and intratumoral TLR activation 
exhibited tumor regression compared to control 
groups (Fig 5c and 5d). This  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was evaluated using both intratumoral CpG administration (TLR [ADDRESS_555767], Fig 5c), as well as

These studies suggest that the induction of high numbers of circulating vaccine-induced,

increased cross priming against other antigens expressed by [CONTACT_7879], and, importantly, tumor regression.

Cross -primed T-cells were found to infiltrate and induce regression of both pDC injected and

generation of pDC-induced p15E specific T- cells was not seen following depletion of NK cells 
(Fig 6). In further studies, we found that activated pDC chemoattract NK cell migration into the

 tumor site (Fig 7a).  We hypothesize that this leads to NK cell activation and IFN  pr oduction, 
tumor lysis (Fig 7b), uptake and cross -priming of tumor antigen by [CONTACT_438559], and activation of 
specific T-cells in the draining lymph nodes.  Indeed, antigen-specific T- cells were decreased 
when activated pDC were intratumorally injected in mice deficient for either perforin or IFN .  
Furthermore, mDCs isolated from lymph nodes draining pDC injected, GFP -expressing tumor 
were found to be GFP positive, and capable of activating antigen-specific T-cells.  Therefore, we 
further hypothesize that TLR-mediated activation of pDC at the tumor site will result in NK cell 
infiltration and cross -priming of antigens to generate T-cells with de novo specificities.  
 
Testing our hypothesis in patients, that vaccines in combination with TLR agonists will enhance 
both T-cell priming and migration/effector function, requires vaccines which can be used to elicit antigen specific T- cells that can be reliably measured in immune monitoring assays. 
 
2.11   Gp100(g209-2M) peptide vaccine 
 
Gp100(g209-2M) is a melanocyte differentiation antigen with high levels of expression in 
melanomas.  A synthetic peptide of gp100(g209-2M) with the replacement of threonine by [CONTACT_438560], referred as g209-
2M appeared to be more immunogenic in vitro than the native peptide, due to enhanced 
binding to the HLA-A*0201 molecule. This peptide has been studied in vivo in patients 
with metastatic melanoma. Tumor -specific immune responses to gp100(g209-2M) 
peptide vaccines have been demonstrated. 
     
Previously our group has reported that the immunization of patients with g209-2M 
emulsified in Incomplete Freund’ adjuvant (IFA) could generate T cell responses against 
the native peptide and melanoma cells

In a study designed to identify the optimal schedule for immunization, patients received g209-

5.8 HLA-A* and HLA -DP4 typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
 
6.0 Treatment Plan 
All patients will receive the class I, HLA -A2 restricted gp100(g209-2M) peptide vaccine. 
Patients who are HLA -DP4 positive will also receive the class II restricted MAGE -3 
peptide, in separate extremities.   This will allow us to generate melanoma-specific CD8 
+ and CD4+ T-cells.  The gp100(g209-2M) immune response will be our primary 
endpoint for assessment of T-cell priming, since we have extensive previous experience 
with this vaccine and believe that CD8+ responses are critical to the development of a 
strong antitumor immune response.  The MAGE -3 peptide will be given in order to 
stimulate antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells, which we believe are also important in the generati on of strong antitumor immunity.  P atients positive for both HLA types will  
2008- 0416 
May 7, 2015 
 
  14  
 receive both vaccines, gp100(g209-2M) and MAGE -3, for eight weeks  Patients who are 
HLA-A2 positive and HLA -DP4 negative will recieve only the gp100 peptide for 8 weeks .  
There will be two arms in Part 1: Arm A is the peptide vaccines plus the TLR7/[ADDRESS_555783], 
R848 and Arm B is the peptide vaccines only. All patients will be randomized to either 
Arm A or Arm B by [CONTACT_438568]. The  randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_9084] (metastatic disease or adjuvant).  In Arm A, R848 gel will be  applied 
to the gp100(g209-2M) vaccine injection site immediately following the injection.  The 
R848 gel will be allowed to air dry for 30 minutes and then covered with a gauze 
dressing. All vaccines w ill be administered subcutaneously and intradermally.   The 
gp100(g209-2M) peptide will be administered in the same extremity weekly (every 7 days +/- 2 days) for 8 weeks.  Similarly, in a separate extremity  of eligible patients , the 
MAGE -3 peptide will be administered weekly (every 7 days +/- 2 days) for 8 weeks.  
Each syringe (a total of 4, 2 for gp100 and 2 for MAGE -3) will contain 1ml of peptide 
vaccine; 0.5ml of the vaccine in each syringe will be administered intradermally and the other 0.5ml w ill be administered subcutaneously at each injection site for a total of [ADDRESS_555784] the gp100(g209-2M) and MAGE -3 vaccines (weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 
24: weeks 8 and 16 will not be collected when leukopheresis is performed; blood 
samples will be collected by [CONTACT_438569] 0 and 8 (+/- 1 week ), and 16 when 
feasible).  To evaluate the inflammatory infiltrate at the site of immunization, biopsies will 
be obtained of vaccination sites as outlined in section 7.3  
 
Subjects in the adjuvant cohort.  
Vaccination will continue for the designated 8 weeks. Blood draw and phe resis times will 
be the same as subjects in the metastatic disease cohorts. Subjects will be monitored for 
disease recurrence, but if recurrence occurs prior to the completion of blood draws or 
pharesis these tests can still be obtained if deemed valid by [CONTACT_978].  
 
Subjects in the metastatic disease cohort: 
At the end of [ADDRESS_555785] only 
received vaccine at this point.    We estimate that of a total of approximately 24 patients 
in this cohort, 17% will dr op off at this point, leaving a total of [ADDRESS_555786] 30 patients 
(10/arm)  with g el and 10  are available for Part 2.  
 
At the end of 8 weeks of vaccine, cutaneous lesions (at least 2  and up to 10 lesions) will 
be assigned by [CONTACT_438570] 0.2% R848 
gel.  The CORe randomization system will not be used in Part 2.  The physician will 
designate the regions and which tumors will be treated.  The area of cutaneous lesions 
will be divided into two regions, Region A and Region B, striving to equalize tumor 
burden in each designated region as best as possible. When feasible, Region A will be a 
proximal group of lesions, and B distal. When this proximal –  distal differentiation is not 
feasible because of the characteristics of the metastatic pattern, then A and B w ill be 
assigned to regions  in no particular order.  If the two regions coalesce during the 
vaccination phase, the coalesced tumor may be divided into two regions. Each target tumor whether it is treated or untreated will be marked, measured and photographed for the medical record.  Because this dose provides the highest level of immune cell

 infiltration, we plan to utilize this dose of R848 two times per week every 3-4 days (+/ - 2 
days), with the option of dose reducing from twice to once a week should pati ents 
experience any grade 3 or greater toxicity.  
 
The physician will designate which of the two regions to receive or not to receive R848.  
(For example, if the cutaneous disease is limited to the thigh, the area of lesions will be 
divided in two with one region proximal and one region distal. Then the proximal region 
is assigned region A and the distal assigned region B. Resiquimod to be applied to 
region A or B.  A 5mm margin will be included in the treatment area around each of the 
lesions at a spread rate of 10mcg/cm2.  The sum of the area of all treated lesions will not 
exceed 100cm2.  The treatment area will be allowed to air dry for [ADDRESS_555787] two weeks at the discretion of the investigators.  
 
Tumor biopsies of treated and untreated lesions will be obtained as outlined in section 
7.3 when feasible in order  to assess T-cell infiltra tion and function at the site.  
 
In order to give patients the opportunity to receive R848 gel on all their lesions, we will 
allow cross -over of patients who do not respond in untreated lesions by [CONTACT_5875] 16 
(8weeks after initiating gel on the tumors) in the untreated lesions to receive R848 gel on 
all of the lesions, but these patients will not be included in the final analysis of clinical 
endpoints that occur following week 24.  Patients will not cross -over until after all blood, 
biopsies, and data are recovered for assessment of the primary endpoints in any 
subject. Treatment with R848 gel will continue for up to 4 months beyond week 24 as 
long as there is no disease progression.  
 
Subjects in either cohort will be followed for 12 months after the completion of therapy 
(vaccination in the adjuvant cohort, Resiquimod in the metastatic cohort) unless they 
meet criteria for withdrawal as per section 10.0.

 7.0 Evaluation During Treatment  
 
7.1      Clinical Evaluation 
 
Patients will be evaluated every 2 weeks (+/- 2 days) through week 4, then 
every 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) during the vaccination/treatment. For subjects in 
the adjuvant cohort, this schedule will continue through week 8, for patients in 
the metastatic cohort, this will continue until Resiquimod treatment is 
discontinued. With each patient visit, the evaluation will consist of complete 
interim history and physical examination, including measurement of vital signs, performance status, and weight.  Patients will be evaluated for toxicity 
and concommitant medications at each visit.   Toxicities will be recorded on the toxicity sheet and the medications will be recorded in the patient’ s 
electronic medical record.  Patients will have a complete blood count (CBC), with differential, PT/PTT, serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, 
albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, LDH, calcium, and total bilirubin 
tested at baseline and then tested approximately every 2-4 weeks (using 
pediatric blood collection tubes if feasible).  
 
For patients in the adjuvant arm,  
 
CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be done at baseline, week 8, (+/- 1 week) and then repeated at 8 week (+/- 1 week) intervals  during 
resiquimod treatment.  MRI/CT of the brain will be done at baseline and 
repeated at the time of the CT scans if clinically indicated.  
 
At discontinuance of vaccination in the adjuvant cohort or resiquimod 
treatment in the metastatic cohort, clinical follow -up, labs, and staging studies 
(CT, MR I, PET scans) will be obtained at the discretion of the treating 
physician following standard clinical pathways.  
 
Subjects in either cohort will be followed on study for 12 months after the 
completion of therapy (vaccination in the adjuvant cohort, Resiquimod in the metastatic cohort) unless they meet criteria for withdrawal as per section 
10.0. Clinical events will be tracked from the physician determined routine 
clinical follow -up during this period. Clinical events that occur after this period 
on study may be retroactively recorded from the patient’s medical record including tumor progression and death. 
 
7.2 Immunological Evaluations    
Sixty mL (4 tablespoons) of peripheral blood will be obtained at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 (+/ - 1 week ) . Weeks 0, [ADDRESS_555788] only ten mL 
(2/3 tablespoon)  of peripheral blood by [CONTACT_438571] . If the leukopheresis is not performed for those time points, 
then we will collect Sixty mL (4 tablespoons) of peripheral blood.  When 
feasible, biopsies of the vaccine site will be obtained and tumor will be obtained as outlined in section 7.3.  
  
2008- 0416 
May 7, 2015 
 
  17  
  
7.2.1 Flow cytometric analysis  
Flow cytometry will be utilized to determine the percentage of antigen 
specific CD8+ (gp100(g209-2M) or CD4+ (MAGE -3) T -cells and the 
percentage of cells expressing phenotypic markers to assess activation status of T-cells in the circulation and at the tumor site.  In 
addition, this technique will be used to determine the nature of the 
inflammatory infiltrate at the tumor site in the presence or absence of 
TLR agonist. 
 
7.2.2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC)  
IHC will be performed on vaccine site and tumor biopsies and will be 
used to assess the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate at these sites 
in the presence or absence of TLR agonists.  Specifically, antibodies 
specific for pDCs, mDCs, NK cells, and T-cell s will be used.  
 7.2.3 ELISPOT/ Luminex  
These assays will be utilized to determine specific cytokine release or 
number of antigen specific spots per 10
4 CD8+ (for gp100(g209-2M) or 
CD4+ (for MAGE-3) T -cells.  In addition, Luminex assays will be 
utilized to determine the cytokine profile of antigen-specific T-cells.  
 
7.2.4 Quantitative RT-PCR  
This technique will be used to determine the gene expression of specific cytokines at the vaccine and tumor sites.  
 
7.2.5 Leukapheresis will be utilized for blood collection together wi th a ten 
mL phlebotomy to obtain peripheral lymphocytes and plasma at three 
time points  when feasible.  Leukapheresis will be performed prior to 
treatment, after treatment at week 8 (+/- 1 week), and at week 16 (+/- 
1 week). This is for both cohorts.  Each  leukapheresis will consist of a 
7.5 to 10 liter exchange lasting about three hours. 
 
7.2.6  Plasma collected from phlebotomy will be used to measure reactivity 
of patient’s antibodies against tumor antigens.  
 
7.3 Biopsies : Two areas will be biopsied during the cour se of this study , the vaccine 
site and the tumor.  
 
Vaccine biopsies:  Vaccine sites will be biopsied from  all patients in the study  when 
feasible. The vaccine site biopsied will be a GP100 vaccine site. The vaccine site will 
be identified and a punch biopsy taken of full thickness skin with standard sterile 
technique and closure. Vaccine sites will be biopsied at 
24 hrs  (+/- 6 hours)  after the 
first gp100(g209- 2M) vaccine  and at week two of vaccination. These biopsies will 
occur the day following the vaccination for that week. F ailure to obtain vaccine 
biopsies due to refusal, discretion of the investigators or infeasibility will not constitute 
a violation of the trial.  
 Tumor biopsies will be taken from patients in the cohort with metastatic disease. 
There will be no tumor biopsies in patients enrolled in the adjuvant cohort. The first 
2008- [ADDRESS_555789] 
dose of R848 on the tumors , and at week 12 (4 weeks after initiating R848 therapy on 
the tumors , but at any time during that week ) Tumors will be randomly selected when 
biopsied, but when feasible, a biopsy will be taken of both a treated lesion and 
untreated lesion at week 12. Tumor biopsies may be taken using any biopsy method to 
optimize tumor yield using standard sterile techniques. Tumor volume may not allow 
for all b iopsies to be obtained in all individuals, in this case pre-vaccine biopsies and 
week [ADDRESS_555790] 
and the investigators, and failure to obtain tumor  biopsies due to refusal, inadequate 
remaining tumor volume, discretion of the investigators or infeasibility will not constitute a violation of the trial.  
7.4 Samples for Research  
 
Leftover blood, tissue, and T-cells (and possibly genetic material extracted from these 
samples) will be stored for research. These samples may be analyzed by [CONTACT_438572]. These samples will be de-identified. The 
research studies involving these samples will be performed following IRB approved 
protocols. The samples used in these research studies will be to gain further 
information about the disease and will not be used for future treatment decisions.  
 
8.0 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
Vaccines are usually well -tolerated. They may cause discomfort, swelling, and/or 
redness around the injection site.  While there has not been significant autoimmune 
symptoms caused by [CONTACT_312620]100(g209-2M) or MAGE -[ADDRESS_555791] frequent systemic toxicities associated with Resiquimod are fever, fatigue, 
headache, pain, dizziness, myalgia, chills, and a small increase in absolute lymphocyte 
count.  Localized toxicities reported ar e erythema, edema, ulceration, weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
scabbing, flaking, pruritis, and numbness/tingling.  Other infrequent toxicities reported that may be related are abnormal LFT, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, backache, neck pain, rhinitis, and uriti caria.   
 All adverse events will be recorded according to this table:

Exceptions to this rule will include events and laboratory abnormalities that represent common 
symptoms and abnormalities of melanoma and chemotherapy and/or have no clinical 
significance:  
 
• Abnormalities in hematologic parameters due to myelosuppressive therapeutic effect: 
 
i. Anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia 
ii. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_339112] 
 
• Common symptoms of cancer (unless grade >/= 3) including:  
 
i. Fatigue  
ii. Weakness  
iii. Bone, joint or muscle pain 
iv. Alopecia  
v. Loss of appetite, Nausea, Vomiting 
vi. Chemistry abnormalities (phosphorus, calcium, glucose)  
vii. Coagulation abnormalities (shortened PT, PTT, increased fibrinogen)  
• Laboratory abnormalities: 
•  
i. LDH (increased or decreased)  
ii. Alkaline phosphatase (increased or decreased)  
iii. Low levels of the following: AST, ALT, creatinine, BUN, uric acid, bilirubin, 
albumin, total protein  
iv. Electrolyte abnormalities (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, CO2, magnesium  
 
Abnormal laboratory test results will be captured if intervention is required.  
Based on the CTCAE  v.4, any grade 3 or greater toxicity will result in a dose reduction of 
the application of R848 from twice a week to once a week, however we will still report 
this AE.  In addition, if this is required in 3 patients, we will temporarily halt accrual so 
that we can reassess the study as indicated.  Abnormal lab values that are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_438542].  The criteria used is 
based on our experience with this assay in patients, was that biologically signi ficant 
response is considered to be > 0.1% gp100(g209-2M) tetramer + cells in the CD8 + T-
cell population, and an increase of >  2 fold of gp100(g209-2M) tetramer + cells at any 
time point over the pre- vaccine levels.  This is based on the sensitivity of detection using

An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
· Death  
· A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.

medical or surgical intervention to pr event one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
· Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse events.  Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by t he

· All life -threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must have 
a written report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the 
Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.  
· Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
· Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific intervention, 
until [ADDRESS_555792] 
returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
· Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur  after the [ADDRESS_555793] be reported to the IND Office. This may include the development of a

Tumor response to therapy this study will be done using immune-related response 
criteria (irRC) which is a modified version of WHO criteria. 
9.[ADDRESS_555798] one diameter > [ADDRESS_555799] diameter with its perpendicular.  Skin lesions can be considered 
measurable.  Cutaneous lesions that are > 5 mm in diameter can be considered 
measurable. 
Non-Measurable (evaluable) Lesions are all other lesi ons, including 
unidimensionally measurable disease and small lesions.  
 
9.2 Definition of Index/Non-Index Lesions 
In many patients, all measurable disease will be cutaneous, so we will allow all 
[ADDRESS_555800] at baseline.  The index  lesions 
should be representative of all involved organs.  In addition, index  lesions should 
be selected based on their size (lesions with the longest diameters), their suitability for accurate repeat assessment by [CONTACT_15218], and how representative they are of the patient’s tumor burden.  A sum of the products of 
diameters (SPD) for all index  lesions will be calculated and considered the 
baseline sum of the products of diameters.  Response criteria to be followed are listed below.  The baseline sum will be used as the reference point to determine 
the objective tumor response of the index  lesions at tumor assessment (TA).  
Measurable lesions, other than index  and all sites of non-measurable disease will 
be identified as non-index  lesions.  Non -index  lesions will be recorded on the 
medical record and should be evaluated at the same assessment time points as 
the index  lesions.  In subsequent assessments, non-index  lesions will be 
recorded as “stable or decreased disease,” “absent”, or “progression.”  
 
9.3 Definition of Tumor Response Using irRC   
The sum of the products of diameters at tumor assessment using the immune-
related response criteria (irRC) for progressive disease incorporates the 
contribution of new measurable lesions.  Each net Percentage Change in Tumor 
Burden per assessment using irRC criteria accounts for the size and growth 
kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear.  
Definition of Index Lesions Response Using irRC  
 
irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all index  lesions.  
This category encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_270336].  
 irPartial Response (irPR): Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in 
the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index  
and all new measurable lesions (i.e., Percentage Change in Tumor Burden).  Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is  factored into the overall

 tumor burden, but does not automatically qua lify as progressive disease until the 
SPD increases by > 25% when compared to SPD at nadir.  
 
irStable Disease (irSD):  Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence 
of progressive disease.  
 irProgressive Disease (irPD):  At least 25% increase Percentage Change in 
Tumor Burden (i.e., taking sum of the products of all index  lesions and any new 
lesions) when compared to SPD at nadir. 
 
Definition of Non-Index Lesions Response Using irRC  
 
irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all non-index  
lesions.  This category encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_438573] (irPR) or irStable Disease (irSD): non-index  lesions 
are not considered in the definition of PR, these terms do not apply.  
 irProgressive Disease (irPD):  Increases in number or size of non-index  
lesions does not constitute progressive disease unless/until the 
Percentage Change in Tumor Burden increases by 25% (i.e., the SPD at 
nadir of the index lesions increases by [CONTACT_242839]). 
 
Impact of New Lesions on irRC  
New lesions in and by [CONTACT_242840].  
However, their contribution to total tumor burden in included in the SPD 
which in turn feeds into the irRC criteria for tumor response.  Therefore, 
new non-measurable lesions will not discontinue any subject from the 
study.  
 
9.4   Definition of Overall Response Using irRC  
Overall response using irRC will be based on these criteria:  
 
Immune-Related Complete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance 
of all tumor lesions (index and non-index together with no new 
measurable/unmeasurable lesions) for at least 4 weeks from the date of 
documentation of complete response. 
 
Immune-Related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the produc ts of the two 
largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions is measured and captured as 
the SPD baseline.  At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of the 
products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions and of new measur able lesions are added together to provide the Immune Response 
Sum of Product Diameters (irSPD).  A decrease, relative to baseline of the irSPD 
compared to the previous SPD baseline, of 50% or greater is considered an 
immune Partial Response (irPR). 
 
2008- 0416 
May 7, 2015 
 
  25  
 Immune -Related Stable Disease (irSD):  irSD is d efined as the failure to meet 
criteria for immune complete response or immune partial response, in the 
absence of progressive disease.  
 
Immune-Related Progressive Disease (irPD): It is recommended in difficult case s to confirm PD by [CONTACT_242841].  Any of the following will constitute 
progressive disease:  
• At least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions over baseline SPD calculated for the index lesions.  
• At least a 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions and 
new measurable lesions (irSPD) over the baseline SPD calculated for the 
index lesions.

9.[ADDRESS_555801] Overall Response Using irRC (irBOR)  
irBOR is the best confirmed irRC overall response over the study as a 
whole, recorded between the date of first dose until the last tumor 
assessment before subsequent therapy (except for local palliative 
radiotherapy for painful bone lesions) for the individual subjects in the 
study.  For assessment of irBOR, all available assessments per subject 
are considered. 
 
If a lesion is surgically resected or treated with definitive radiosurgery, the 
size of the lesion prior to the definitive local therapy will be included in the 
calculated irBOR.  
Primary evidence of antineoplastic activity will be evaluated as a function of objective tumor response following the vaccination period. An overall 
objective assessment of all measurable and non- measurable disease will 
be performed as outlined in 9.1. Tumor assessments should be 
performed by [CONTACT_117145], ultrasound, MRI or CT scan, throughout the study.  The treating physicians will perform tumor measurement. 
Radiological studies must account for all lesions that were present at 
baseline and must use the same techniques as used at baseline. All 
2008- [ADDRESS_555802] four weeks later. 
 
9.6 Baseline measurement  
In this trial a period of immunization opens the treatment, and 
immunization alone mediates tumor response rarely.(  Cancer 
immunotherapy: moving beyond current vaccines. Rosenberg SA, Yang 
JC, Restifo NP. Nat Med. 2004 Sep;10(9):909-15.) So with this sequence, 
as has been seen with other immunologic mediators, we should expect 
that a period of progression may precede any response from the 
treatment.   
 
Therefore, because subjects are likely to progress during the vaccination 
portion of the study, the baseline will be that measurement during the first 10 weeks of the study at which the tumors are at their maximum size 
(based on sum of LD). Progression wil l be allowed during these first [ADDRESS_555803] from treatment or from the study. 
This includes increase in the size of the lesions as well as the 
appearance of new lesions.  
10.0 Criteria for Removal From T he Study 
     10.1 Disease progression: 
All patients who develop recurrent disease will be taken off the study. 
Patients in the either cohort may complete their laboratory evaluation 
(blood draws, biopsies and pharesis) if they recurr/progress before week 
16. Patients will be allowed to continue on the study if their disease 
progress es during the first [ADDRESS_555804] only 
received vaccine +/- local TLR agonist at this point.  For subsequent 
evaluations, patients with progressive disease will be removed from the 
treatment.     
10.2    Withdrawal of consent:    
The patient’s desire to withdraw from the study may occur at any time.  If 
a patient withdraws consent, the investigator will assess whether the 
reason for withdrawal is actually an adverse event, in which case the 
adverse event should be noted as the reason for withdrawal.  
  10.3 Adverse event:  
 
Including unacceptable toxicity or exacerbation of underlying disease 
associated with treatment and necessitating discontinuation of treatment, 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to the patient’s life or 
functioning.  For example, any grade III or greater toxicity, attributable to 
the peptide vaccines or R848 (Resiquimod)   
 
   
 
2008- 0416

   10.4 Withdrawal by [CONTACT_099]:  
                         For clinical reasons not related to treatment. 
 
 
 
10.5 Violation of the study protocol:   
 
Including patient failure to return for required visits.  Every effort should 
be made to contact [CONTACT_438574], and to assess any adverse events that may have contributed 
to the patient’s failure to return.  Patients who miss dose(s) because of 
holidays and/or clinic closures will not be withdrawn from the study.  
 
10.6 End of study 
 
Subjects in either cohort who do not meet any  of the above criteria will be 
followed for 12 months after the completion of therapy (vaccination in the 
adjuvant cohort, Resiquimod in the metastatic cohort) and will be 
removed from the study thereafter.

 11.0 Statistical Considerations 
 
Overview  
 
This is a randomized phase II trial enrolling melanoma patients who are HLA -A2+ with or 
without HLA-DP4+.  Patients of two separate types will be enrolled in separate cohorts. 
One cohort includes patients who are NED but at high risk for recurrence. The second 
cohort will include patients with non- visceral metastatic disease and must have at least 
two evaluable and biopsiable lesions to be eligible for the trial.   
 
The trial will have two parts.  In Part 1 (both cohorts) , we will fairly randomize patients to 
receive either the gp100(g209-2M) + /-MAGE3 peptide vaccine plus a topi[INVESTIGATOR_90514] 7 /[ADDRESS_555805], R848, (Arm A) or the gp100(g209-2M) +/- MAGE3 vaccine alone Arm B). The 
randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_9084].  A total of 48 patients will be enrolled, 24 per arm.  All patients will receive the gp100(g209-2M)  vaccine  (those who are HLA -DP4  +  
will also receive the MAGE3 vaccine ) weekly (for 8 weeks) and the patients randomized 
to receive R848 gel will have the gel applied to the gp100(g209-2M)   vaccine site 
weekly.   
 After 8 weeks of treatment on Part 1, Part 2 of the trial begins.  In Part 2 (only patients in 
the metastatic disease cohort) , the treating physician will divide the area of cutaneous 
lesions into regions, Region A and Region B  and des ignate the two regions to receive or 
not to receive R848.  At least one lesion will be randomly assigned to receive R848 from 
weeks 8 through 24, and one will not.  One lesion from each region will be chosen for 
biopsy  as outlined in section 7.3.  If a patient has more than two evaluable lesions, we 
will stratify by [CONTACT_438575]. 
As a safety measure, if a patient’s untreated lesions grow while treated lesions are 
stable or shrink, all lesions will be treated with R848.  This will occur after the 
assessment of the primary endpoints of the study, so it will not affect the analysis of these endpoints.  
 
In April 2015, the trial is being further modified to add an additional 20  patients with 
metastatic disease, all of whom will receive the the gp100(g209-2M) +/- MAGE3 peptide 
vaccine plus R848 (Arm C).  These patients will not be part of the primary comparative 
study analysis of T-cell responses in the blood.  The purpose of thes e patients is to 
provide additional information on characterizing tumor response, defined as at least a 
50% shrinkage in tumor size by [CONTACT_118429].  
 
 
Part 1  
The primary objective of Part 1 of the trial is to compare T-cell responses in the blood 
between the vaccine+R848 and vaccine alone treatment arms. This will be assessed in 
the two cohorts separately and combined. The primary outcome of this part of the trial 
will be T -cell response to gp100(g209-2M) +/- MAGE3 measured at 8 weeks using a 
tetramer/multimer assay measured by [CONTACT_4133].  Based on the number of 
gp100(g209-2M) +/- MAGE3 T -cells measured, when the study began, patients were to 
be categorized as either immune responders or immune non -responders.  From 
previous vaccine studies, a ≥ 0.1% r esponse was thought to be a reasonable target.  
Thus, T-cell response to the gp100(g209-2M) + /-  MAGE3 peptide in each patient was 
2008- 0416 
May 7, 2015 
 
  29  
 defined as ≥0.1% gp100(g209-2M) tetramer+ cells in the CD8+ T-cell population or 
≥0.1% MAGE3 multimer cells in the CD4+ T-cel l population.  In September 2013, due to 
problems in obtaining the multimers necessary to perform the CD4+ T-cell assays, these assays have not yet been run, although more than [ADDRESS_555806] reached week 24 on 
the trial.  Based upon the aggregate CD8+ r esponses, no patients have met the 
definition of response according to the above definition.  Therefore, the study team is 
changing the definition of the primary endpoint to be the actual change from baseline for 
gp100(g209-2M) tetramer+ cells in the CD8+ T -cell population.  The study will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_9084] (NED/metastatic), but we expect the same immune response in each 
cohort.   
 
For part 1 the 8-week primary immune outcome values CD8+ T -cell response will be 
compared between the two arms  by [CONTACT_2329] a Wilcoxon rank -sum test.   Patients who 
discontinue from the study before week [ADDRESS_555807] rank in this 
analysis.  With one interim analysis, using an O’Brien-Fleming boundary to stop for 
efficacy, a one-sided significance level of 0.05, with [ADDRESS_555808] 80% power to be able to detect an effect size of 0.73*SD(CD8+ T-cell response). 
 
Part 2  
The primary outcomes for part 2 of the trial are immune cell infiltration for pDCs, mDCs, 
and NK cells in the tumor biopsy samples.  This can be assessed in the metastatic 
disease cohort only, since those subjects in the adjuvant therapy cohort are free of 
disease. Tumor samples will be taken as outlined in section 7.3 Three different types of 
analyses will be performed on these tumor biopsies: (1) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 
the degree of pDC, mDC, and NK cell infiltration, (2) Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis for 
infiltrating melanoma specific CD8+ T cells, and (3) Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT -PCR) 
assays for IFN -γ, IFN -α (and other  type I interferons), IL-12, and TGF-β .  For each of 
these outcomes, we will determine the differences in each of these parameters between the pretreatment and post-treatment samples for each of the biopsied lesions for each 
patient.  Mixed-effect models will be fit for each parameter to assess the effects of 
treatment, time, and the initial randomization to gp100(g209-2M) + /- MAGE -3 vs. 
gp100(g209-2M) + /- MAGE -3 +R848.  If there is no evi dence of an effect due to the 
initial randomization in Part [ADDRESS_555809]  (which represents a lower bound on the mixed-effects model given above), is as follows: we assume that a 
total of 24 patients will be enrolled in the metastatic disease cohort, and of these, 17% of 
the patients initially enrolled will discontinue the trial at 8 weeks due to progressive 
disease and that dropout will be equally distributed across the 2 arms , leaving a total of 
20 patients (10/arm) for Part 2.  The 2-sample t-test will assess differences in the 
change between the two treatment groups with respect to the [ADDRESS_555810] 80% power to detect an increase of 1.[ADDRESS_555811] with a 5% Type I error rate.  One of the benefits of our mixed-
effects modeling approach is that it allows for the analysis of the data using complete 
likelihood methods (Beunckens, Molenberghs, and Kenward, 2005; Clinical Trials).  In 
addition, we will perform 2 types of sensitivity analysis:  1) We will use last-observation-
carried -forward; 2) We will explore how deviations from the Missing at Random (MAR) 
2008- [ADDRESS_555812] inference using methods 
developed in Verbeke and Molenberghs (2000).   
 
Additional Cohort of Non-Randomized Patients 
 As noted above in the Overview, after the initial [ADDRESS_555813] been enrolled in the 
randomized portion of the trial, 20  additional patients with metastatic disease will be 
enrolled into Arm C  in order to further characterize tumor response of R848.  These 
patients will not be included in the primary analysis.  Tumor response as measured by a 
50% shrinkage in tumor size by [CONTACT_438576].  The response rate associated with the standard of care in these patients is no more than 5%.  We expect a total of 10 metastatic disease patients in Arm A from the 
initial randomized portion of the trial.  Combined with the additional 20  patients  (Arm A 
and C , with a total of [ADDRESS_555814] 82% power to detect an increase to 22%, 
assuming a one-sided exact binomial test with a 5% Type I error rate. 
 
Overview of Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
In addition to the Part 1 and Part 2 primary endpoints described above, several 
additional secondary endpoints will be investigated. Blood will be drawn at baseline, 2, 4, 
8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks, and every 4 weeks after the 24 -week draw.  A secondary 
analysis for data generated from Part 1 will measure ex vivo  IFN- via ELISPOT assay.  
This outcome is measured as a continouous variable. Our first step will be to plot each laboratory parameter over the [ADDRESS_555815] the data for any 
interesting trends between the two clinical trial arms.  Separate graphical displays will be 
created for each treatment arm (gp100(g209-2M)/MAGE vaccine+R848 and 
gp100(g209-2M)/MAGE vaccine alone).  Subsequent to the initial exploratory data 
analys is discussed above, a repeated measures model will be fit for each measured 
parameter in the blood to the data using Proc Mixed in SAS to model the repeated laboratory measurements over the [ADDRESS_555816] (R848 gel) to activate innate immune cells at the vaccine site we will 
evaluate the inflammatory microenvironment at the site of the immunization.  Immune 
cell infiltration for pDCs, mDCs, NK cells, and T- cells will be measured along with 
immune cell function using IHC and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT -PCR) by [CONTACT_438577] B.  For 
each pati ent, changes from baseline will be calculated for both the lesions treated with 
R848 and for the non-treated lesions. The [ADDRESS_555817] to compare the measures between the lesions within patient.  
Significance will be assessed at the 5% level.  
 
To evaluate the ability of R848 gel, administered at the tumor site to induce inflammation 
and up-regulation of adhesion molecules on tumor vasculature we will  focus on the 
tumor biopsies taken in R848 treated and untreated tumors  at pre and post-treatment 
timepoints outlined in section 7.3. These biopsies will be used to investigate the effect of 
R848 treatment on tumors compared to untreated tumors. We will measure inflammation 
and activation of tumor vasculature using Immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and flow 
cytometry (FACS), We will use mixed models to assess differences between treatment 
groups. Our mixed model will include fixed effects for treatments, and random effects for 
2008- [ADDRESS_555818] to model the within 
patient variability. Signific ance will be assessed at the 5% level.  
 
To evaluate the ability of R848 gel, administered at the tumor site to enhance immune -
cell infiltration into tumor we will utilize antibodies to PDC, mDC, NK, and T cells.  Since 
these are continuous measures (asses sed at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks, 
and every 4 weeks after the 24-week draw) we will use mixed models to assess 
differences between treatment groups. Our mixed model will include fixed effects for 
treatments, and random effects for time, treatment-by -time interaction and an additional 
random effect to model the within patient variability. Significance will be assessed at the 5% level.  
 To evaluate the ability of R848 gel, administered at the tumor site to generate T-cells 
against additional tumor antigens, not  present in the vaccine (i.e., antigen spreading) we 
will assess cytokine production against de novo antigens.  Since these are continuous 
measures (assessed at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks, and every 4 weeks 
after the 24-week draw) we will use mixed models to assess differences between 
treatment groups. Our mixed model will include fixed effects for treatments, and random 
effects for time, treatment-by -time interaction and an additional random effect to model 
the within patient variability. Significance will be assessed at the 5% level.  
 
To evaluate the association between clinical response and laboratory parameters ofT-
cell priming, T-cell migration to tumor, and inflammation at the vaccine and tumor sites 
we will expl ore the relationship between immune cell activation measures at the vaccine 
site (vaccine site measures) and at the tumor site (tumor site measures) . Additionally we 
will assess the effect of the TLR agonist R848 upon clinical response. Clinical response will be assessed using the immune- related response criteria (irRC) and will be assessed 
at week 8, 16, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Since both vaccine site measures and tumor site measures are continuous variables we will assess association between these 
two types of variables using Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficient. In addition, 
we will use logistic regression to model the relationship between either vaccine site or 
tumor measures and best clinical response assessed over a 16 weeks period after initial 
vaccination.   
 
To assess the association between R848 treatment on lesions and response, the irRC 
will be used to assess response separately by [CONTACT_157251] (lesions receiving or not 
receiving R848 cream). That is, using the irRC, we will, for each patient, assess if the 
lesions not treated with R848 cream responded and also determine if the lesions treated 
with R848 cream responded. Thus, for each patient we will record 4 possible joint 
outcomes ++,+-, -+, and --, where the ++ indicates that both lesions receiving and not 
receiving R848 cream responded; -- indicates neither types of lesions responded. 
Similarly + - and -+ indicate one type of lesion responded while the other did not. We will 
assess differences between treatments (based on within patient differences) using 
McNemar’s test. A statistically significant difference with respect to the McNemar’s test will indicate if cream administered to the lesion results in improved outcome (i.e., 
immune -related rsponse criteria) relative to lesions for  which cream was not 
administered.  
 
 
2008- [ADDRESS_555819] whether there is 
strong evidence that the immune  responses  differ between the two treatment arms.  We 
will use an O’Brien-Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_438544], with a nominal 
significance level of 0.0056.  With the alpha spent at the interim look, the nominal significance level at the final analysis wil l be 0.0482.

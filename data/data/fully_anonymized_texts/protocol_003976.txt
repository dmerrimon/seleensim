2.Introduction 2.1.Background and Rationale The IntelliVue Patient Monitors MP/MX series (with the etCO2 module) is an FDA-approved device made by [CONTACT_483671] (FDA 510(k) clearance K161531). It is commonly used in U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483658] (HR) derived from an ECG signal and for the respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR) derived from etCO2 density. However, it requires attachment to the patient’s body, and cable connection to a display unit. The RHEA Vital Sign Vigilance System was developed by [CONTACT_483672]. Ltd.  It is designed for automatic, continuous and contact-less measurement of heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_483659] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_422167]. The system uses a sensor placed under the patient’s mattress, and does not require a sensor to be fixed to the body. This provides a more comfortable solution for long-term continuous patient monitoring. Continuous monitoring of people's vital signs, in particular heart rate (HR) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR), may provide a mechanism to alert doctors or nurses of disease deterioration or an imminent severe clinical event. Monitoring people's vital signs outside an ICU often relies on nursing staff conducting checks at set intervals. The device can reduce the workload for nursing staff in non-ICU wards. The FDA-cleared EarlySense System 2.0 (K131379) developed by [CONTACT_483673]. is also a contact-less system designed for continuous monitoring heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_483660]. It has been sold in over [ADDRESS_1172418] been reported. According to publicly available clinical results, the EarlySense System has shown an 86% reduction in Code Blue events, and a 45% reduction in Length of Stay (LoS) in the ICU for patients coming from the medical/surgical unit (1, 2). The EarlySense device applies the pi[INVESTIGATOR_483661], the RHEA investigational device applies the optical fiber sensor. This difference leads to the RHEA device having a higher accuracy, capacity for greater patient weight range, longer sensor life and a lower cost. A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_483662] 25 healthy volunteers (20 adults and 5 children) showed that the RHEA device can obtain accuracy of overall mean root mean square difference (RMSD) of both HR and RR of 1.9 with the same testing procedure described in this current protocol (3). When comparing with the reference device- the EarlySense device on 9 adults, the RHEA device obtained results with no significant difference (pair t test is used to evaluate the results according to this protocol.) Heart beat or respi[INVESTIGATOR_483663] a slight vibration which cannot be observed visually. However, the fiber sensor contained in the RHEA sensor unit will be deformed by [CONTACT_483674], resulting in a change in the optical signal being transmitted. This changed optical signal is received by [CONTACT_483675]. The HR and RR then can be calculated by [CONTACT_483676]-time. The change in the optical signal can also be used to determine if the patient has exited the bed with a notification displayed on the bedside unit. The system is intended for use as a ‘contact-free’ under-mattress device monitoring heart rate Version 1.0, 12 April 2017   Page !/! 619   Confidential
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_483664], and to notify users when the patient exits the bed. The data can be displayed, exported and reviewed. This protocol aims at verifying the safety and effectiveness of the investigational device in a general-care clinical environment. 2.2.Study Objectives This clinical trial aims to verify that the RHEA Vital Sign Vigilance System can fulfill its intended use and meet its declared performance and functional specifications. Statistical analysis comparing the performance of the RHEA Vital Sign Vigilance System and the reference device EarlySense System 2.0 to the MP/MX series separately aims to demonstrate that the investigational device is substantially equivalent to the cleared reference device-EarlySense System 2.0 in safety and effectiveness. 3.Study Design This will be a cross-over, ‘self-controlled’ study comparing the investigational device RHEA Vital Sign Vigilance System to an approved under-mattress device, EarlySense System (Model 2.0) (K131379). Both will be compared to the ‘gold standard’ Philips MP/MX series model Patient Monitor. The same Monitor Device must be used across all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483665]. The testing will be conducted in three periods. In the Accuracy Tests (periods 1 and 2), one of the contact-free devices will be used to monitor the HR and RR, while being compared with the MP/MX series Patient Monitor. The RHEA investigational device and reference device will be used to monitor the same subject at different times (cross-over design), as the sensors of the two devices are placed at a similar location of the bed. HR and RR will be recorded for all three devices. Comparison of the performance of the two contact-free devices will be performed on the recorded results via statistical analysis. The third test will assess the ability of the RHEA device to accurately detect motion on or exit from the bed, as compared to the manual observation. One clinical trial sites will be selected in the U.S. A total of [ADDRESS_1172419] will be one to two hours, including device placement, measurements, and device removal. Wards should be representative of non-ICU wards in U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (e.g., medical/surgical, oncology, orthopedics, long term acute care). 4.Subject Selection Subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483666]-ICU settings, who fulfill the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Version 1.0, 12 April 2017   Page !/! [ADDRESS_1172428]:This test will be conducted only on subjects who can move and exit the bed easily. The Monitor Device tester will ask the subject to turn or move ten times and exit the bed for three times randomly in five minutes. The Monitor Device tester will record the time of these events on the CRF. At the same time, the Investigational Device tester will observe if there is an “unexpected motion” or “bed exit” notification on the screen of the Investigational Device and will record the time of this event on the CRF. Device Testing Considerations: 1.At the baseline for each subject, make sure the following information is recorded: subject ID, date of birth, gender, height, weight, location, time and clinical diagnosis. Adverse events should be recorded and kept during the tests. The record should be signed by [CONTACT_483680]. 2.It is important that nothing be allowed to shake the bed during the test. Anything that will produce vibration (such as a phone or another person) is not allowed to be on the bed during the test. 3.Make sure there is sufficient stable time before the HR and RR results are recorded for the Investigational Device and Reference Device. Thirty seconds is considered to be reasonable for Investigational Device and [ADDRESS_1172429] lies down and keeps still again. 7.Device Safety and Stability Evaluation Safety and stability data should be recorded in the CRF for Investigational device only. 7.1.Safety Assessments Included but shall not be limited to the following: 1)Electrical shock 2)Loose components leading to device failure 3)Failure of the device to resume normal operation after power is interrupted 7.2.Stability Included but shall not be limited to the following: Version 1.0, 12 April 2017   Page !/! 1219   Confidential

If omission and mistakes are found, the Investigator will Version 1.0, 12 April 2017   Page !/! [ADDRESS_1172431] been resolved, the Investigator will review the data and confirm their accuracy with his/her signature [CONTACT_483685]. 10.Statistical Analysis 10.1.General Statistics Design •Randomization: consecutive selection: selecting every subject in the order they present in the site if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria till it reach the pre-specified number. •Blinding: Two investigators observe the results from the investigational device and reference device separately. Time-stamp method (see time synchronization as described in Section 6.3, Testing Procedures) will be used in the comparison. 10.2.Primary Variables The primary variables for the analysis of heart rate (HR) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR) are each the overall mean root mean square difference (RMSD), defined as the mean of the individual subject RMSDs.  For each subject, the RMSD is calculated as: RMSD = sqrt{ Σ(YR – YG)2/n} where YR and YG are the paired values for the RHEA Vital Sign Vigilance System and the gold standard method (Patient Monitor), respectively, and n is the number of data pairs. If motion or a bed exit occurs within [ADDRESS_1172432] will still be included in the analyses. The primary hypotheses for HR, are as follows: Adults HO: µ = 3.25 vs. HA: µ < 3.25, Children Version 1.0, 12 April 2017   Page !/! 1419   Confidential
HO: µ = 3.5 vs. HA: µ < 3.5, The primary hypotheses for RR, are as follows: Adults HO: µ = 2.25 vs. HA: µ < 2.25, Children HO: µ = 2.5 vs. HA: µ < 2.5, where µ represents the population mean HR or RR. 10.3.Primary Analyses For each subject, the RMSD will be calculated for both HR and RR. These individual values will be presented in both a listing and graphically as a cumulative distribution. The mean RMSD and its two-sided 95% confidence interval (mean RMSD ± t0.975 * std err RMSD) will be presented. If the upper bound of the confidence interval is less than the hypothesized value, the corresponding null hypothesis will be rejected. For each rejected hypothesis, the study will have met its primary objective. 10.4.Secondary Analyses Accuracy of the RHEA will be compared with that of the Reference Device-EarlySense device.  The RMSD for the Reference Device will be calculated for each subject in the same manner as described for the RHEA. Mean accuracy will then be compared between the RHEA and the Reference Device by [CONTACT_483681] a paired t test at the 5% level of significance. Motion and no motion accuracy will each be calculated along with their respective two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Motion accuracy will be calculated as the proportion of times that the device correctly detected motion among all actual occurrences of motion detected manually.  Non-motion accuracy will be calculated as the proportion of times that the device correctly did not detect motion among all actual occurrences of no motion detected manually.

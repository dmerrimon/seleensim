2 Summa ry  
Eggs are nutrient dense, convenient, affordable, and provide key macro and micronutrients in 
one's diet. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_79615] a lot of benefits of consuming eggs in relation to health recent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_671778]. For 
instance, under free -living conditions, higher egg int ake is associated with increased 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in diabetic individuals as well as increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_284628] 2 diabetes. However, these studies do not establish that egg consumption "causes" health 
issues.  
It is also possible tha t the association of egg intake with increased CVD risk in diabetics, or with 
a greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_303729], is simply due to the other foods that people usually eat with 
eggs, such as saturated fats, and not due to eggs per se . 
For part I, the inv estigators propose to test this hypothesis by [CONTACT_671793] 48 
non-diabetic individuals under free -living conditions using the remote food photography method 
(RFPM), which uses smartphone technology. The frequency of egg consumption will b e 
obtained using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). In addition, participants will record their 
food intake using food record diary and a [ADDRESS_907654] breakfasts of 
similar calories, containing 1) Eggs; 2) Eggs with a high amount of saturated fat; 3) Cereal 
breakfast (neither eggs nor saturated fat ); or 4) Cereal breakfast with a high amount of saturated 
fat. Alteration of blood glucose, insulin, hunger, and satiety hormones (ghrelin, PYY, GLP -1), 
and metabolic rate will be measured before and after each breakfast in part II.  
The investigators expect to determine if the purported association of eggs to alterations in 
glucose control and related metabolic alterations are independent of eggs, but mainly due to 
saturated fat is eaten along with eggs rather than the egg consumption itself . 
A. Specif ic Aims / Objectives :   
1. To use the RFPM to accurately determine the dietary pattern associated with egg intake in 
48 free living non -diabetic individuals who eat eggs often.  
 
 
3 2. To assess and compare the hormonal levels related to hunger and satiety following ; A-Egg 
breakfast, B -Eggs breakfast with high amount of saturated fat, C - Cereal breakfast, D -
Cereal breakfast with high amount of saturated fat.  
3. To assess and compare insulin levels  and blood glucose levels following A-Egg breakfast, 
B-Eggs breakfast with high amount of saturated fat, C - Cereal breakfast, D -Cereal 
breakfast with high amount of saturated fat.  
4. To examine whether total energy intake and consumption of saturated fat will be associated 
with the baseline insulin levels, blood glucose levels, Homeostatic Model Assessment 
(HOMA) index of insulin resistance calculated using glucose and insulin levels , and 
HbA1C levels . 
5. To compare diet induced thermogenesis in A-Egg breakfast, B -Eggs breakfast with high 
amount of saturated fat, C - Cereal breakfast , D-Cereal breakfast with high amount of 
saturated fat.  
6. To compare RFPM method with [ADDRESS_907655] and 24-hour recall in dietary assessment  
 
B. Hypotheses:  
These aims will test the following hypotheses:    
1. Meals that include eggs will have higher energy  and saturated fat contents as determined by 
[CONTACT_671794], compared to corresponding meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch, or dinner) without eggs.  
2. As determined by [CONTACT_671794], individuals of the study sample who will be in the highest 
quartile in terms of egg consumption in th e free -living condition (defined as high 
egg consumers) will have a higher intake of saturated fat and total energy as 
compared to individuals who will be in the lowest quartile in terms of egg 
consumption (defined as low egg consumers).  
3. Baseline insulin l evel, blood glucose level, the Homeostatic Model Assessment 
(HOMA) index of insulin resistance using fasting glucose and insulin levels, and 
HbA1C will be positively associated with total EI and saturated fat intake 
determined by [CONTACT_671794], even when adjusted f or age, sex, BMI and waist 
circumference  
4. Above outcome variables will not be associated with egg intake determined by 
[CONTACT_671794].  
 
 
[ADDRESS_907656] will be 
associated with a) a greater increase (i.e. bot h area under the curve and pre -post 
change) in satiety hormones (i.e. PYY and GLP -1), b) a less profound increase in 
blood glucose and insulin levels, c) a greater decrease in the hunger hormone 
(ghrelin) and d) an increase in the area under the curve of m etabolic rate when 
controlled for the content of saturated fat in the test diets.  
6. In the randomized partial crossover study, presence of a high amount of saturated 
fat in the breakfast will be associated with a) a greater increase (i.e. both area under 
the curve and pre -post change) in satiety hormones (i.e. PYY and GLP -1), b) a less 
profound increase in blood glucose and insulin levels, c) a greater decrease in the 
hunger hormone (ghrelin) and d) an increase in the area under the curve of 
metabolic rate wh en controlled for the presence of eggs in the test diets.  
7. In the randomized partial crossover study, the associations mentioned in hypothesis 
[ADDRESS_907657] and the 24 -hour recall in dietary assessment.  
 
 C. Significance:  
An association between egg consumption and diabetes should not be ignored. However, it is 
important to identify if such an association does indeed exist and, if so, whether or not there is 
evidence that suggests that it is not the eggs themselves that driv e the association, but rather a 
concurrent undesirable profile of macronutrient intake.  Food intake data assessed by [CONTACT_671795] 23.  Capturing food intake 
data in real time by [CONTACT_671796]. The RFPM has been validated 
for accuracy against the doubly labeled water me thod 24, 25.  With high accura cy, we will identify 
the nutrients associated with egg consumption.  Intake at every meal will be captured for [ADDRESS_907658] measurement of fed state. 
Overall, the studies will provide stronger evid ence to accept or refute some of the adverse effects 
reportedly associated with egg consumption, so that appropriate dietary recommendations could 
be designed.   It will form the basis for future research to determine if the dietary pattern 
accompanying eg gs and not eggs per se is linked to diabetes and other adverse metabolic 
consequences.   
Study Design and Methods  
I. Subjects:    
A. Overview:   
The proposed study will comprise of two parts: Part I: an observational study based on 
ecological momentary assessment, and Part II: a randomized partial crossover clinical trial. Same 
subjects will participate in both parts of the study.  
In the observational study, the dietary intake of the subjects will be evaluated using an ecological 
momentary assessment app roach for [ADDRESS_907659] will get exposed to only two out of 
the four diets (thus, partial crossover). Therefore, there will be six possible combina tions of diets 
(i.e. 4! / 2! [4 -2]!) and 12 possible ordered combinations (i.e. permutations; 4! / [4 -2]!) of diets. 
Four subjects will be randomly assigned to each of these 12 possible ordered combinations of 
diets. Thus, the total sample size will be 48 (i.e. n = 4x12).  
B. Recruitment :  
Advertisements for the recruitment of participants will be posted on social media and notice 
boards within the [LOCATION_007] Tech University (TTU) including the web -based notice boards (Tech 
Announce), radio and television. Append ix A-1 and Appendix A -2 provide written material and 
Flyer Ad that would be used for these announcements. No students of any investigators will be 
recruited or enrolled for this study and flyer ads or person -to-person solicitation scripts will not 
 
 
6 be admin istered in any of the investigator’s classrooms. The flyer ad described in Appendix A -[ADDRESS_907660] information tabs for all participants interested in 
the study.

II. Procedures : 
A. Initial work  
 
 
[ADDRESS_907661] in participating will be contact[CONTACT_426] a graduat e research 
assistant who will administer a structured telephone interview (Appendix B) to 1) provide 
information related to the requirements of the study, along with potential risks and benefits 2) 
Screen for eligibility based on specific inclusion and exc lusion criteria. All potential subjects will 
be informed that their responses will remain confidential and that taking part in the screening 
interview in no way obligates them to participate.  
Potential participants who meet participation criteria as assess ed via the telephone prescreening 
process will be contact[CONTACT_671797]/phone within 48 hours following the 
interview to inform of eligibility (or ineligibility) and to schedule an initial visit if deemed 
eligible.  
B. Anthropometric Measuremen ts and Blood Pressure  
Height and weight will be measured using a wall -mounted stadiometer and standardized scale, 
respectively. BMI (body mass index) will be calculated from the measured height and weight 
using the formula weight  (kg)/height2 (m2).  Waist and hip circumference will be measured 
according to the World Health Organization’s methods for measuring waist and hip 
circumference 26. Blood pressure will be measured u sing a standardized electronic 
sphygmomanometer.  
C. Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM)  
RFPM was developed and validated by [CONTACT_349493] -investigator (CM). RFPM employs smartphone 
technology as a means of estimating energy intake remotely from participants’ home 
environments.  Collection of RFPM data will be done using the SmartIntake© smartphone “app”. 
Subjects will be trained to take photos of foods before eating and of the leftovers, if any. 
Subjects can use their own phone or a smartphone will be provided with the app. The 
photographs will be sent to co-investigator (CM) , where they will analyze the RFPM data (food 
images) in coordination with the collaborators on the project and quantify energy and 
macronutrient intake. These data will be sent back.  
D. Test Meals  
Four  test breakfasts  will be matched for energy density, and ma cronutrient composition (Table 1 ). 
Breakfasts will be prepared and assembled onsite at [LOCATION_007] Tech University. Preparing and serving 
meals will be done in accordance with standardize d measures and in compliance with food safety 
regulations.

E. Blood work  
To collect blood samples, an IV catheter will be placed in the subject’s upper limb by a 
registered nurse. Hence, there will be one needle stick per visit.  If an adequate blood sample 
cannot be accessed using the IV catheter, which happens rarely, with the subject’s approval, a 
singlestick needle blood withdrawal will be performed. However, there will be total of 4 needle 
sticks i ncluding the initial needle stick done to insert the IV catheter applied in a single visit. The 
recruited regi stered nurse is an experienced person who is currently working in the ER. She is 
properly trained in placing IV catheters and drawing blood.  A total of 20 mL (4 teaspoons / 1.3 
tablespoons ) of blood will be taken at all pre -and postprandial blood draws, which will be used 
to assess the levels of hormones via radioimmunoassay kit, blood glucose levels and HbA1c. 
Blood will be drawn into chilled ED TA tubes (Greiner Vacuette, Monroe, NC) and immediately 
spun at 1600 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Aprotinin (0.6TIU/ml, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc, 
Burlingame, CA) will be immediately added to the plasma which then will be aliquoted and 
stored at -80 degree s until assayed for HbA1C, ghrelin, PYY3 -36, GLP -1 and insulin. For blood 
glucose levels, samples will be collected for sodium fluoride containing EDTA tubes (Greiner 
Vacuette, Monroe, NC). Blood draws will be continuously done at [ADDRESS_907668] 
blood draws.  
F. Food Frequency Questionnaire  
 
 
10 Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) adapted from diet history questionnaire (DHQ) by [CONTACT_671798], to id entify subjects belonging to quartiles for egg consumption. Number of eggs 
eaten per week will be determine based on FFQ. This will be given on the first visit.  
G. Resting Metabolic Rate  
RMR will be determined using a MedGem® indirect calorimeter as follows:  The subject will sit 
comfortably in a chair wearing a nose clip, and will breathe normally into a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. The 
RMR measurement will take approximately [ADDRESS_907669].  
H. Hunger and Satiety  Questionnaire   
Hunger and fullness will be assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (Appendix E). This will 
be provided [ADDRESS_907670] for 7 -day period (Appendix G). A 24 -hour recall 
will be collected on the day 1 of the 7 days using Automated Self -Administered 24 -Hour 
(ASA24®) Dietary Assessment Tool .   
  
 
Visit 1 - The eligible subjects will come to TTU clinic (Tech Plaza rooms 302 and 305) at about [ADDRESS_907671]. Here subjects are allowed to take water.  After obtaining informed 
written consent (Appendix C), anthropometric measurements like weight, heig ht, waist and hip 
circumferences and blood pressure measurements will be taken (Table 4).  
Next, pre -prandial blood sampling will be d own [ADDRESS_907672] 
consumption. Pre-prandial blood draw will be done to assess fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and 
hormone levels (i.e. serum insulin PYY, GLP1, ghrelin ). Post -prandial blood draws will be done 
to assess blood glucose and hormone levels. Following pre -prandial blood draw, subjects will be 
asked to assess their hunger and fullness using the visual analog scale (VAS) (Appendix E).  
The RMR will be tested for  each subject, followed by a standardized test breakfast  1, provided a 
smartphone and trained to photograph their food intake, using the smartphone provided. The 
subjects will be asked to consume the entire breakfast in 10 minutes. A food frequency 
 
 
11 questio nnaire ( FFQ) (Appendix F) will be given to assess the egg consumption.  RMR will be 
determined [ADDRESS_907673] ’s IV catheter will be removed . 
Subjects will  take photos of foods before eating and of the leftovers if any with the help of a 
smartphone using SmartIntake© app  for [ADDRESS_907674] (Appendix G) as well. On the following day (day 1 of 7 days) a 24-hour 
recall will be done using Automated Self -Administered 24 -Hour (ASA24®) Dietary Assessment 
Tool . 
Visit [ADDRESS_907675]’s upper limb to collect blood for 
blood glucose, and hormones. Blood will be collected for fasting blood  glucose levels and insulin 
levels PYY, GLP1, ghrelin (as described above)  [ADDRESS_907676] cons umption. Following each blood draw, subjects will be asked 
to assess their hunger and fullness using the visual analog scale (VAS) (Appendix E). RMR will 
be determined [ADDRESS_907677].

Statistical Analyses  Plan (SAP) :   
Data will be imported to R statistical software and the distributions will be examined 
visually  to make a decision about the appropriate statistical tests (i.e. parametric / non -
parametric) to be used for all comparisons.  All statistical analyses will be conducted using R 
statistical software. Family -wise error  rate will be maintained at 0.05.  
Free living EI and saturated fat intake during main three meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and 
dinner) of each subject will be determined using RFPM and the meals of all test subjects will be 
categorized based on the presence or the absence of eggs in the meals. Means of EI and saturated 
fat intake during each main meal will be compared between the two categories (i.e. eggs present 
vs. eggs absent) using multi -level mixed -effects regression models constructed using the 
lmerTest  package in R statistical software. Age, sex, baseline BMI and / or waist circumference 
will be included in the models as subject -level covariates.  
Based on RFPM data, mean EI and saturated fat intake of the high egg consumers (i.e. 
individuals in the top quartile based on egg consumption) will be compared with the mean EI and 
saturated fat intake of the low egg consumers (i.e. individuals in the bottom quartile based on egg 
consumption) via Welch t -tests or the Wilcoxon test, depending on the distributions  of the data.  
Linear regression models will be constructed to examined the associations between a) 
total EI, b) saturated fat intake and c) egg intake and each of i) baseline insulin level, ii) blood 
glucose level, iii) HOMA -IR, and iv) HbA1C level. The us ual regression assumptions will be 
assessed and any concerns will be ameliorated as appropriate (e.g. apply a transformation as 
guided by [CONTACT_312256] -Cox)  
Using the data obtained in the randomized partial crossover trial, multi -level mixed 
effects regression model s will be constructed using the lmerTest package in R statistical software 
to predict each of a) PYY (AUC and pre -post change); b) GLP -1 (AUC and pre -post change); c) 
ghrelin (AUC and pre -post change); d) blood glucose (AUC and pre -post change); e) insulin  
(AUC and pre -post change); f) metabolic rate using i) the presence of eggs in the diet; ii) the 
 
 
15 presence of a high content of saturated fat in the diet; iii) their interaction. Age, sex, baseline 
BMI and / or waist circumference will be included in the mo dels as subject -level covariates.  
Mean EI estimates of food records  and 24 -hour recall methods will be compared with the 
EI estimates of RFPM both with and without controlling for age, sex, baseline BMI and / or 
waist circumference by [CONTACT_2164] a mixed -effects regression model to predict EI using the 
lmerTest package in R statistical software. The methods of estimation will be included in the 
model as a categorical independent variable and RFPM will be specified as the reference 
category. Age, sex, basel ine BMI and / or waist circumference will be included in the models as 
subject -level covariates.  
Potential Risks : 
There  will be little  or no long-term risk expected from participation  in this research  project. 
Since there are multiple blood draws, they will be done by [CONTACT_671804]. And blood draws will be 
done using aseptic techniques.  No risk is anticipated for eating breakfast containing eggs or 
from RFPM or questionnaires for food intake.   
As with any research study, there are risks for breach of confidentiality. To mitigate this risk the 
master list of participant  names  and corresponding  participant  codes  will be stored  separately  
and securely from  the electronic  research  database in the locked office in a secure locked filing 
cabin (i.e. behind 2 locks per HIPPA standards for patient records).  There  will be no personal  
identifying information  in the research  database;  therefore,  participants  cannot  be identified  
from  that source. All electronic  files containing participant identifying data will be 
password  protected  and stored  on digital  recording  media  in separate  locations  (in locked  
filing  cabinets  behind  locked  doors)  at TTU.  The participant  signed  Informed Consent will  be 
similarly stored.  
The participants will be informed of the right to withdraw from the study at any point. The 
participants who withdraw will be provided with compensation and other benefits for the time 
spent up to the point of withdrawal. The participants will be provided with access to the study 
personnel and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_671779], text messaging or 
email. If an unexpected non -emergent adverse event is to occur, the participants will be referred 
to a health care facility. For any urgent  health concerns, participants will be instructed to dial [ADDRESS_907695] current Basic 
Life Support CPR training. The IRB will be notified regarding any adverse events that occur 
during the study.  
Potential Benefits :  
 Participants will learn about their blood sugar, insulin and satiety hormone values.  They will 
also learn about their resti ng metabolic rate.  
Subject Compensation  
Participants in the study will be compensated $100 for participation.  Subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_907696] consumed for all 7 days 
they will receive anothe r $50 ($7 for each day).  Finally, subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_907697] begins any visit and is unable to complete it, $[ADDRESS_907698] breakfasts.  
On each of these designated days, subjects’ will be required to fill out the required paperwork to 
receive compensation. Our research team will follow the guidelines stated in OP 62.[ADDRESS_907699] their healthcare provider or visit local urgent care 
facilities (contact [CONTACT_671805]). For medical 
 
 
17 emergencies, the particip ants will be instructed to dial 911.  The TTU IRB will be notified per

Introduction:  
You are invited to participate in a research study by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nikhil Dhurandhar, Department Chair of 
the Nutritional Sciences Department at [LOCATION_007] Tech University (phone number:  [806] -742-5270) . 
There are two main parts of this study. In the first part, you will be sending photographs of which 
you have eaten including snacks for seven days using RFPM. As the second part o f the study, you 
will be participating in [ADDRESS_907721] on the 2nd visit as well. 
You will be asked to eat two different breakfasts in each visit.  
Purpose of the Study:  
The purpose of this study is to use the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM)  to understand 
the usual dietary patterns of a person.   
Explanation of the Procedures:  
There will be two visits to our facility during this study. On the 1st visit, you will report after not 
eating or drinking anything that morning between 7:00 am and 9:[ADDRESS_907722] is served in a fasted state. We will also be taking a small amount of blood 
(4 teaspoons) and asking you to answer a hunger questionnaire before breakfast is served.  
To take blood, a trained registered nurse, will place an IV catheter into your upper limb. We will 
take one blood sample before and five blood samples after breakfast. Since we leave the IV 
catheter inserted till the blood withdrawal is over you will have one needle stick per visit. If IV -
catheterization fails  at some point , which happens very rarely w e will take blood from separate  
needle sticks  every half an hour.  However, there will be total of [ADDRESS_907723] blood glucose levels, glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c (glucose 
bound hemoglobin) and for amounts of the substances that can control your feelings of hunger 
and fullness. Your signature [CONTACT_671820] a later time. After the completion of the study and all publications have been 
accepted, all blood specimens will be destroyed.   
You will then fill out a standardized questionnaire about your feelings of h unger. Breakfast will 
be brought to you at this point and you will be trained how to use RFPM by [CONTACT_671811]© 
smartphone app. For this you can use your own phone or we will provide you with a phone. You 
will be served breakfast called Test Breakfast 1. This will be either one of the four breakfasts that 
we will be testing in this study. The type of breakfast you will get will be randomly assigned.

You will not be able to use any electronics at any mealtime during this study. You will have 10 
minutes to eat all food before you. You then relax and fill out the same questionnaire at the same 
time blood (4 teaspoons) is taken at 30, 60, 90, [ADDRESS_907724]. In addition, 
your resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be measured using indirect calorimetry [ADDRESS_907725].  
Days 1 -7:  
You will  take photos of foods before eating and of the leftovers, if any with the help of a 
smartphone using SmartIntake© app  for [ADDRESS_907726] as well. On the following day (day 1 of 7 days) a 24-hour recall will be done using

Eggs are nutrient dense, convenient, affordable, and provide key macro and micronutrients in one’s 
diet. However, recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_671781], indicating These studies indicated that under free living conditions, higher egg intake is associated 
with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in diabetic individuals.   Also, greater egg consumption 
is reportedly associated with greater ri sk of type [ADDRESS_907737] this hypothesis by 
[CONTACT_671814] 40 non -diabetic individuals.  Food intake will be determined using the 
remote food photography method which employs smartphone technology as a means of estimating energy 
intake remotely from participants’ home environments.  We expect to observe th at the purported 
association of eggs to dysregulated glycemic control is independent of eggs, but mainly due to the dietary 
pattern around egg intake.  If true, an informational campaign will be needed to clear eggs from the “guilt 
by [CONTACT_102854]”. Alterna tively, if eggs intake is indeed associated with impaired glycemic control, then 
appropriate steps should be taken to inform people accordingly.

 B. Background  
Eggs are nutrient dense, convenient, affordable, and are valuable in providing key macro and  
micronutrients in one’s diet.   Particularly, eggs are known for their superior quality of proteins and 
essential amino acids such as leucine, which can augment insulin action to improve glycemic control. 
Overall, meta -analyses and epi[INVESTIGATOR_671782] (cardiovascular disease) or stroke 
among healthy individuals [1-8].    In fact, egg consumption improves weight loss [9, 10]  or blood lipid 
and glucose profiles of diabetic individuals [11].  However, recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_671783]. These studies indicated that under free living 
conditions, higher egg intake is associated with increased CVD risk in diabetic individuals [3, 12, 13] .   
Also, greater egg consumption is reportedly associated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes [14-16]. If 
indeed diabetes is a concern associated with egg consumption, unequivocal data are urgently required 
to express appropriate caution .  Likewise, eggs should be cleared of the concerns, if ill -founded.    
Several issues question the applicability of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_671784]. While eggs improve glycemic cont rol of diabetic individuals under the controlled environment 
of experimental intervention [11],  epi[INVESTIGATOR_671785], 
higher egg intake predicts risk of diabetes or CVD risk for diabetic individuals.  Possibly, higher egg 
intake is simply a marker for other dietary indiscretions. For instance, from lowest to highest egg 
consumers, men reported greater daily energy intake from 1,870 kcal to 2,372 kcal, greater saturated fat 
intake and a 5 -fold increase in bacon consumption, although their BMIs were nearly identical [3] - this 
strongly suggests that greater egg intake is associated with greater intake of other nutrients.  Predictably, 
the association of CVD with egg consumption disappe ared when bacon intake was also considered [3].  
Individuals predispo sed to impaired glycemic control  may be particularly susceptible to undesirable health 
effects of higher saturated fat and energy intake.  In such individuals, saturated fat may overwhelm the 
beneficial effects of eggs on lipid and glycemic profile.  A possibility that beneficial effects of eggs on 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_671786]. [3].   For a clearer understanding in those 
with impaired glycemic control, the effect of eggs should be separated from that of accompanying 
saturated fat consumed.  
Therefore, our Central hypothesis is that the association of egg intake with increased CVD risk in 
diabetics, or with greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_303729], is due to the accompanying dietary pattern, and not 
due to eggs per se.   Specifically, we postulate that rather than eggs, the greater energy intake and saturated 
fat intake (e.g. bacon, b utter, hash browns, etc.) associated with greater  egg consumption contribute to 
the stated health risks.   We propose to test this hypothesis as follows, by [CONTACT_671815] (RFPM), which was developed and validated by [CONTACT_349493] -investi gator (CM). RFPM 
employs smartphone technology as a means of estimating energy intake remotely from participants’ home 
environments.  
Aim:   Use the RFPM to accurately determine the dietary pattern associated with egg intake in [ADDRESS_907738] the following hypotheses:    
 
 
[ADDRESS_907739] higher energy and saturated fat content vs similar meals without 
eggs.  
2. The daily total energy and saturated fat intakes are different between low and high egg consumers.  
3. The HbA1C levels are positively associated with total energy intake or saturated fat intake.  
4. When adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, energy and saturated 
fat intake, HbA1c is not significantly associated with egg intake.  
 
 C. Significance  
An association between egg consumption and diabetes should not be ignored. However, it is important 
to identify if such an association does indeed exist and, if so, whether or not there is evidence that 
suggests that it is not the eggs themselves that driv e the association, but rather a concurrent undesirable 
profile of macronutrient intake .  Food intake data assessed by [CONTACT_671816] [17].  Capturing food intake data in real time by [CONTACT_671817]. The RFPM has been validated for accuracy against the doubly labeled 
water method [18, 19] .  With high accuracy, we will iden tify the nutrients associated with egg 
consumption.  Intake at every meal will be captured for [ADDRESS_907740] that this study will 
demonstrate that intake of eggs is associated with an undesirable profile of macronutrient 
intake.   Overall, the studies will provide stronger evidence to accept or refute some of the adverse 
effects reportedly associated with egg consumption, so that appropriate dietary recommendations could 
be designed.   It will form the basis for future research to determine if the dietary pattern accompanying 
eggs and not eggs per se is linked to diabetes and other adverse metabolic consequences.   
D.  Research plan  
Overview :  Subjects who routinely eat eggs will be recruited.  Their  food consumption pattern will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_175542] (FFQ), to identify subjects belonging to quartiles for egg 
consumption. Number of eggs eaten per week will be determine based on FFQ. This will allow us to 
identify low and high con sumers of eggs (bottom vs top quartile for egg consumption per week).  Next, 
the RFPM, - a highly validated and innovative approach that uses camera -enabled Smart phones  with 
data transfer capability [19] will be used to accurately assess food intake during all meals and snacks for 
7 days.  The RFPM   will quantitate and compare the daily intake of saturated fat and energy, and 
saturated fat intake accompanying eggs between low and high egg consuming individuals.   
Subjects:   Inclusion criteria :  40 non -diabetic individuals (fasting glucose < 126 mg/dL), male or female, 
BMI > 20 and < 60 kg/m2, Age: 18 – 65 y, Weight loss < 5% in the past 3 months.  Exclusion : Diabetes, 
on diabetes medication, pregnant or lactating females, those with a history of gestational diabetes, have 
an unstable cardiac condition, a major systemic illness, a history of drug abuse or eating disorders, have 
uncontrolled  hypothyroidism, h ave familial hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_125270], allergies sensitivity to or dislike of eggs, 
consumption of < 1 egg per week, or attempting to lose weight.  
 
 
 
44 
 Approach :  After determining eligibility and obtaining informed consent, the eligible subjects will come 
to TTU clin ic on at about [ADDRESS_907741] (e.g. 
bagel, 4 tsp cream cheese, 6 oz non -fat yogurt, 1 fruit (app le), 8 oz fruit juice), provided a smartphone and 
trained to photograph their food intake, using the smartphone provided.  They will record all meals for the 
next 7 days (consumed under free living conditions) and the RFPM technology will be used to quanti tate 
and analyze energy intake and macronutrients.   
 
Outcome measures : Age, baseline BMI, HbA1c, waist circumference, baseline fasting glucose, per meal, 
daily and 7 -d intake of energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, and eggs.     
 
Statistical procedures:  
a. Power calculations: With [ADDRESS_907742] 80% powered to detect effect sizes that are 
equal to or greater than 0.45, which is a fairly modest effect size, using a nominal value of 0.[ADDRESS_907743] 0.43; see 
Figure 1. With conservative adjustment for multiple comparisons, these thresholds rise to 0.61 and 0.53, 
respectively; see Figure 2.  
 
Figure 1:        Figure 2:   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b. Analyses:   
i.  Within -subject comparison of meals that include eggs vs similar meals (e.g. breakfast vs 
breakfasts) without eggs for energy and saturated fat content.  
ii.  Comparison of daily energy and saturated fat intakes between low and high egg consumers (top 
quartile vs bottom quartile as determined by [CONTACT_281874]). Because this measure of egg consumption is  
   

 
 
45 
 based on self -reported FFQ recall, as a sensitivity analysis we will also consider the correlations 
between these outcomes and observed egg consumption over the period of observation.  
iii.  Correlation between HbA1C or fasting glucose levels and total energy intake or 
saturated fat intake (for 7 days), with and without  adjustment for age, BMI, energy and 
saturated fat intake.  
  
Expected results :  We expect that meals, particularly breakfasts, that include eggs have higher energy 
and saturated fat content due to accompanying foods (such as hash browns, fries, sausages, or bacon).  
This may further contribute to greater overall energy and saturated fat intake for high egg consumers vs 
those who consume eggs less frequently. Finally, we anticipate that when adjusted for age, BMI, energy 
and saturated fat intake, fasting bl ood glucose or HbA1c will not be significantly associated with egg 
intake.  
 
Implications:   we expect that the purported association of eggs to dysregulated glycemic control is 
independent of eggs, but mainly due to the dietary pattern around egg intake.  If true, an informational 
campaign will be needed to clear eggs from the “guilt by [CONTACT_102854]”.  However, if egg intake is indeed 
associated with impaired glycemic control, then appropriate steps should be taken to inform people 
accordingly.    
 
Investiga tors:  We have assembled a strong team of researchers that covers various aspects of this 
study. As a physician, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_671787] [ADDRESS_907744] of 
eggs [9, 10, 20, 21] .   [CONTACT_175584] is a well -trained biostatistician with specific expertise in obesity 
and metabolic conditions.  He designed the power analyses and statistical analyses for this project, 
and he will be responsible for all st atistical analyses.  [CONTACT_56559] has pi[INVESTIGATOR_671788] (RFPM) described below, which photographically records food 
intake and adds a very unique strength to our study. In addition, we have excellent  clinical research  
facilities and equipment, currently used for several funded clinical protocols.  With the help these 
outstanding facilities and well experienced team, we expect to successfully complete the proposed 
study.

 G.  Budget Justification  
a.  TTU costs  
 
Personnel:  [CONTACT_175584]’s help will be invaluable for statistical analyses of this study.  A very modest salary 
support is requested. To keep costs down, salary support for principle investigator or research associates is not 
requested.  
 
Recruitment costs:  We need [ADDRESS_907754] compensation:   Each subject is required to report to clinic at the beginning and end of the study and 
photograph each meal before and after consumption for 7 days. Funds are requested to prov ide to subjects as 
compensation for their time.  
 
Blood tests:   To reduce costs, we will use the finger stick approach. This will not need a phlebotomist, blood 
draw, storage, shipment of samples or payment to commercial clinical laboratories for blood tes ts.  Instead, we 
will use commonly available strips for HbA1c and blood glucose determinations.  
 
RFPM training:  This is the most critical part of the study. Therefore, we will send a researcher to PBRC to 
receive training in RFPM from [CONTACT_56563] [CONTACT_9195].  F unds are requested for this training.  
 
Publication costs and conference presentations:   A modest amount is requested towards travel and registration 
for conferences such as Obesity Week, American Diabetes Association, or Experimental Biology, to present data 
and towards journal charges as publication costs.

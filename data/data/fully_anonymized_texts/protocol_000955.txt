 LUN 229 Synopsis 
 
 Title of Study : Double -Blind Randomized Phase II Trial of Carboplatin and Pemetrexed with or 
without OGX -427 in Patients with Pr eviously Untreated Stage IV Non -Squamous -
Non-Small -Cell Lung Cancer  (The Spruce Clinical Trial)  
SCRI  Innovations  
Protocol Number:  LUN 229  
Sponsor:  SCRI Development Innovations   
Study  Duration:  The duration of the study through the 
last patient  treated  including   follow -up: 
32 months  
 Phase of Trial:  II 
Number of Subjects:  The total number of patients expected to be accrued is 155.  
Objectives:  Primary Objective  
 To compare the progression -free survival (PFS) of OGX -427 plus 
carboplatin/pemetrexed ther apy versus  placebo plus 
carboplatin/pemetrexed in previously untreated patients with advanced 
non-squamous NSCLC.   
Secondary Objectives  
 To compare the objective response rate (ORR) in each treatment arm.  
 To compare overall survival (OS) in each treatment arm. 
 To evaluate safety     
Exploratory Objectives  
 Correlative analyses of serum levels of Hsp27.  
 Correlative analysis of treatment outcomes with specific biomarkers.  
Study Design:  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, Phase II study comparing 
pemetrexed and carboplatin plus OGX -427 followed by [CONTACT_598271] -427 versus pemetrexed and carboplatin plus placebo followed by 
[CONTACT_598272]-squamous NSCLC.  The patients, investigator, study team members, (except for 
the mixing pharmacist/nurse), and anyone involved with the conduct of the trial 
from the time of randomization until database lock for the primary endpoint analysis 
will be blinded to the identity  of the treatment assignment (OGX -427 or placebo).  
The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS.   
A total of 155 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_27183] (adenocarcinoma vs. large cell carcinoma) and smoking status 
(smoker vs. non -smoker) for the purpose of balance of enrollment and exploratory 
analysis.

Statistical 
Methodology:  Sample size considerations are based on progression -free survival (PFS) and follow -
up considerations are base d on overall survival (OS).  The median PFS in the 
control group (carboplatin with pemetrexed plus placebo) is estimated to be 
approximately [ADDRESS_791153] ratio (HR) of 0.60, corresponding to 
a median PFS in the experimental group (carbopl atin with pemetrexed plus OGX -
427) of 8.[ADDRESS_791154] 85% power to test this 
hypothesis using a one -sided log -rank at the 5% level of significance.  Based on a 
uniform 15 -month accrual period, a minimum of approximately 12 months follow -
up period for PFS and a loss to follow -up/non -evaluability for PFS assessment rate 
of approximately 10% per year, a total of 155 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 
manner to achieve the targeted number of events in the scheduled PFS follow -up 
time.  Sample size and power calculations were performed using PASS 2008 
software.  
Descriptive statistics and statistical methods such as survival analysis and regression 
analysis will be used to assess the correlation of treatment outcomes with results  
from correlative testing.  
Correlative Testing : Blood samples will be collected from all patients and assessed for serum Hsp27 
levels at baseline, prior to the initial loading dose, and during treatment.  At these 
time points, approximately 7 mL of blood (red topped tube) will be collected for 
serum Hsp27.   
Hsp27 and AKT exist in complex with p38 MAPK and MK2 in the cytoplasm 
(Zheng et al. 2006 ).  Studies have shown Hsp27 regulates AKT activation and 
promotes cell  survival by [CONTACT_598273]2 to the AKT signal ( Zheng et al. 2006 , 
Wu et al. 2007 ).  The anti -tumor effect of Hsp27 inhibition might be associated with 
a decrease in AKT or  other signaling pathway.  Therefore, the status of PTEN loss 
and mutation status of a panel of genes are suggested to be explored to investigate 
whether specific biomarker status has predictive value for Hsp27 inhibition.  
Available archival tissues will be collected from patients and may be assessed for  
PTEN (protein expression by [CONTACT_4658]) and mutations in a panel of genes including, but 
not limited to: ABL1, AKT1, ALK, BRAF, CTNNB1, DDR2, EGFR, ERBB2, 
FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, GNA11, GNAQ, GNAS, HRAS, IDH1 , IDH2, 
KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, MPL, MYC, NPM1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, 
PIK3R1, PTCH1, RUNX1, RET, SMO, STK11, and WT1.

 1 INTRODUC TION 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide ( Pazdur et al 2004 ).  
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of these cases.  The 
majority of patients present with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.  
Patients with advanced disease rarely survive [ADDRESS_791164] year 
of diagnosis.   
1.1 B ackground 
Combination chemotherapy can extend survival, palliate symptoms of progressive disease, 
and improve the quality of life in patients with advanced NSCLC.   
Pemetrexed is a novel, multi-targeted antifolate, antimetabolite agent that initially was 
a
pproved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for the treatment of unresectable 
malignant pleural mesothelioma in combination with cisplatin after demonstrating superior 
response rates, time to progression (TTP), and survival compared with cisplatin alone 
(Vogelzang et al. 2003 ).   
Scagliotti completed a multicenter, randomized, Phase III study of previously untreated 
locally advanced NSCLC patients, comparing pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus cisplatin 
(75
 mg/m2)  D ay 1 every 21 days versus gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2) Day 1 and Day 8 plus 
cisplatin (75 mg/m2) D ay 1 every 21 days.  Overall survival (OS) with pemetrexed and 
cisplatin was statistically non-inferior to that achieved by [CONTACT_598274] 
(Scagliotti et al. 2008 ).    
Pemetrexed and carboplatin were compared in a large Phase III study with standard 
gemcitabine and carboplatin as first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced NSCL C 
(Gronberg et al. 2009 ).  Of the 423 patients analyzed for toxicity the patients receiving 
pemetrexed and carboplatin had less hematologic toxicity and need for supportive care than 
the patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin.   
Maintenance treatment with pemetrexed following induction chemotherapy has been tested 
in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study ( Ciuleanu et al. 2008 ).  Patients in 
the trial received [ADDRESS_791165] regimens (gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel) with 
cisplatin or carboplatin.  Treatment selection was at the discretion of the investigator.  
Responders after 4 cycles (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease 
[
SD]) were randomly assigned maintenance therapy with either pemetrexed or best 
supportive care (BSC) plus placebo until progression.  Improvement in the non-squamous 
NSCLC patient population was significant.  OS was 14.4 months for the pemetrexed-treated 
pa
tients and 9.4 months for the patents receiving placebo.  In the same group, median 
progression-free survival (PFS) for pemetrexed versus placebo was 4.4 months versus 1.8

1.1.1 OGX-427 
OGX-427 is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to bind to heat shock protein 27 
(Hsp27) mRNA, resulting in the inhibition of the production of Hsp27 protein.  Hsp27 is 
over-expressed in many cancers including prostate, breast, lung, and bladder.  Increased

antitumor effects with pemetrexed after treatment with OGX-427 in A549 cells (unpublished 
results see Figure 1).

igure 1: Enhanced Pemetrexed Effects After OGX-427 Treatment in A549 Cells 
 
To evaluate cell cytotoxicity, A549 cells were treated with 50nM OGX-427 for 2 consecutive 
days and incubated with indicated concentration of Pemetrexed for 72 h ; 72 h later, cell 
viability was determined by [CONTACT_598275]; ScrB = scrambled oligonucleotide 
Increased apoptotic rates were also observed with pemetrexed after OGX-427 treatment in 
A549 Cells ( Figure 2).

To evaluate cell apoptosis, A549 cells were treated with 50nM OGX-427 for 2 consecutive 
days and incubated with indicated concentration of Pemetrexed for 72 h ; 72 h later, total 
protein was extracted and analyzed by [CONTACT_259771]; ScrB = scrambled oligonucleotide. 
Similar synergistic results have been observed with OGX-427 in combination with platinum 
(please refer to the OGX-427 Investigator Brochure for more detailed information). 
1.[ADDRESS_791167]-line treatment.  Patients with non-squamous NSCLC treated with 
platinum/pemetrexed lived longer than patients treated with platinum/gemcitabine.    
Moreover, pemetrexed resulted in a survival advantage in patients with non-squamous lung 
cancer when used as a maintenance therapy in the first-line setting compared with patients 
treated only at progression.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_598258], overall survival for patients 
with adva
nced disease remains relatively poor. 
OGX-427 is a 2’-methoxyethyl (MOE) oligonucleotide analogue which targets Hsp27.  
Hsp27 is a stress-activated ATP-independent cytoprotective chaperone which mediates 
treatment resistance in cancer.  Preclinical models demonstrate that OGX-427 is a potent 
Hsp27 inhi
bitor across solid tumors.  A phase I study of OGX-427 as monotherapy or in 
c
ombination with docetaxel could not identify a maximum tolerated dose.  There was a 
single dose-limiting toxicity of cerebral hemorrhage; however, infusion reactions were 
common.  These reactions were largely low-grade and rarely (<1.5%) resulted in treatment 
modification.  Several patients at varying dose levels had evidence of tumor shrinkage, 
including patients with NSCLC.

 This randomized phase II study will compare the combination of carboplatin/pemetrexed 
with and without OGX-427 in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous 
NSCLC.  The multicenter study will be conducted through the Sarah Cannon Research 
I
nstitute network.

following reasons: 
 Disease progression 
 I rreversible or intolerable toxicity or abnormal laboratory values requiring 
treatment discontinuation according to Section 6, Dose Modifications 
 Una ble to complete at least [ADDRESS_791175] one chemotherapy agent 
 P atient requests to withdraw from the trial and discontinue treatment 
 C onditions requiring therapeutic intervention not permitted by [CONTACT_760] 
 I ntercurrent illness or safety concerns which, per the investigator, prevent 
continuation of study treatment 
 Non-compliance/lost to follow-up  
 Globa l or severe deterioration of health status such that it requires discontinuation 
of protocol treatment without objective evidence of disease progression 
Af
ter discontinuation from study treatment, patients must be followed for adverse events 
(AEs) for [ADDRESS_791176] dose of study drug(s).  All new AEs occurring 
during this period must be reported and followed until resolution, unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_598259], these values are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In 
this case, the investigator must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s 
medical record and as a comment on the Case Report Form (CRF). 
All patients who have Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.0 [ h ttp://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE ]) at the time 
of discontinuation must be followed until the laboratory values have returned to Grade [ADDRESS_791177] his or her reasoning for making this decision in the 
patient’s medical record and as a comment on the CRF. 
3.2.2 Pr egnancy 
During the course of the study, all female patients of childbearing potential (the definitions of 
“women of childbearing potential” are listed in Appendix B )  must contact [CONTACT_598276] (a missed or late 
menstrual period).   
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant prior to administration of study 
drug(s), the study drug(s) must be withheld until the result of the pregnancy test is confirmed.  
If a pregnancy is confirmed, the patient must not receive any study drug(s), and must be 
discontinued from the study.   
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant after the patient has been receiving 
study drug(s), the study drug(s) must immediately be withheld until the result of the 
pregnancy test is confirmed.  If a pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug(s) must be 
immediately and permanently stopped, the patient must be discontinued from the study, and 
the investigator must notify the Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) Study Chair as soon 
as possible.  If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study, a Pregnancy Form (a 
paper report form) should be completed and faxed to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  
For more details regarding handling and reporting of pregnancies that occur during treatment, 
see Section 11.4.

5 S TUDY DESIGN 
This is a r
andomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II trial comparing pemetrexed  
and carboplatin plus OGX-427 followed by [CONTACT_598277]-427 versus 
pemetrexed and carboplatin plus placebo followed by [CONTACT_598278]-squamous NSCLC.  The patients, 
investigator, study team members, (except for the mixing pharmacist/nurse), and anyone 
involved with the conduct of the trial from the time of randomization until database lock for 
the primary endpoint analysis will be blinded to the identity of the treatment assignment 
(OGX-427 or placebo).  The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS.

 5.1 T reatment Plan 
Pre-medications for Study Drug (OGX-427/Placebo)  
To reduce the potential of known potential allergic reactions occurring with OGX-427, 
patients will receive the following pre-medications 30-60 minutes prior to OGX-427/placebo 
administration during the loading doses and Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8 and 15).    
 a n antihistamine (diphenhydramine 25-50 mg or equivalent antihistamine)  
 a n H2 an tagonist (ranitidine [ADDRESS_791179] equivalent) 
 a  corticosteroid (dexamethasone 8-12 mg or corticosteroid equivalent) 
If the patient has not manifested signs or symptoms of an infusion reaction during the loading 
doses and Cycle 1, the patient may be treated in subsequent cycles without some or all of the 
pre-medications.  However, should Grade 2 or greater reactions occur, the patient should 
resume pre-medications, including dexamethasone, prior to study drug for the duration of 
treatment. 
Table 1. Premedications for Pemetrexed/Carboplatin  
Pat

 Study Drug - OGX-427 (or Placebo) Loading Doses:   
Treatment will be initiated within 5 days from randomization with a Loading Dose Period 
(Day -9 to Day -1) followed by 21-day (3 week) study treatment cycles.   
Three separate administrations of study drug will be given during the 9-day Loading Dose 
Period.  The 3 loading doses (600 mg OGX-427 or placebo) must be administered with at 
least one “
non-treatment” day between each dose (i.e. every other day).  This 9-day period 
for the loa
ding doses allows for variations in the treatment schedule due to holidays and 
clinic schedules.  There must also be a minimum of [ADDRESS_791182] loading dose and Cycle 1, Day 1.  
Study Treatment Phase: 
Patients will receive the study drug, 6 00 mg OGX-427 or placebo, prior to the administration 
of
 pemetrexed and carboplatin administration on Day 1 of each cycle.  A maximum of 4 
cycles will be given.  Study drug will also be administered on Day 8 and Day 15 during each 
cycle (i.e., weekly).  
Study Drug :  
OGX-427 or placebo will be administered intravenously, after preparation in D5W.  OGX-
427 or placebo should be added to 250 mL D5W as close to the time of administration as 
possible.  The dose will be administered intravenously as an infusion over approximately 
2 hours using either a peripheral or central indwelling catheter.  Refer to Section 8.1 for 
pr
eparation and administration instructions for OGX-427 or placebo. 
Pemetrexed: 500 mg/m2 IV Day 1 q 21d  
Infuse over approximately 10 minutes or according to institutional standards within 
approximately 30 minutes after the end of the Study Drug infusion 
Carboplatin:  Area Under the Curve (AUC) 6 IV Day 1 q 21d   
Carboplatin, at a dose calculated to produce an AUC of 6 will be administered by [CONTACT_598279].   
The carboplatin dose will be calculated using the Calvert Formula based on the patient’s 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which is estimated by [CONTACT_598280].   
 
Calvert Formula:  Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC x (GFR + 25) 
 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended that physicians consider 
c
appi[INVESTIGATOR_598260] (AUC) to avoid potential toxicity 
due to overdosing for all laboratories using the IDMS-derived serum creatinine 
measurements.  Therefore the maximum dose of carboplatin should be based on a CrCl no 
greater than 125 mL/min for patients with normal renal function.  In these, carboplatin can be 
safely dosed according to the instructions in the drug’s labeling.  Refer to US FDA, Center 
for
 Drug Evaluation and Research website:

5.[ADDRESS_791183] version 1.1 (see Appendix E ) will occur after Cycle 2 
and Cycle 4 (see Section 7.5).  A maximum of [ADDRESS_791184] objective response or stable disease after four cycles of therapy (minimum 
of three cycles) will then move to the Maintenance Phase of the trial.  Patients will receive 
pre-medications with folic acid, vitamin B12 and dexamethasone as described in Table 1.   
Dur
ing maintenance therapy patients will receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV and Study Drug 
on Day [ADDRESS_791185] scans (per RECIST 
version 1.1; see Section 9) every 6 weeks (after every 2 treatment cycles).  Patients will be 
eli
gible to continue maintenance treatment as long as they are benefiting and have no 
evidence of disease progression, and do not meet any criteria for discontinuation or 
withdrawal (see Section 3.2.1).  
5.3.1 Cor relative Testing 
Blood samples will be collected from all patients and assessed for serum Hsp27 levels at 
baseline, prior to the initial loading dose, and during treatment.  At these time points, 
approximately 7 mL of blood (red topped tube) will be collected for serum Hsp27.   
Hsp27 and AKT exist in complex with p38 MAPK and MK2 in the cytoplasm ( Zheng et al. 
2006).  Studies have shown Hsp27 regulates AKT activation and promotes cell survival by 
[CONTACT_598281]2 to the AKT signal complex ( Zheng et al. 2006 , Wu et al. 2007 ).  The anti-
tum
or effect of Hsp27 inhibition might be associated with a decrease in AKT or other 
signaling pathway.  Therefore, the status of PTEN loss and mutation status of a panel of 
genes are suggested to be explored to investigate whether specific biomarker status has 
predictive value for Hsp27 inhibition.  
 
SCRI Innovations LUN 229 Protocol Amendment 3  
05 November 2014 Version 4.0  
Page 32 of 77 
 Available archival tissues will be collected from patients and may be assessed for PTEN 
(protein expression by [CONTACT_4658]) and mutations in a panel of genes including, but not limited to:  
ABL1, AKT1, ALK, B-Raf, CTNNB1, DDR2, EGFR, HER2, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, 
FGFR4, GNA11, GNAQ, GNAS, HRAS, IDH1, IDH2, KIT, K-Ras, MEK1, c-Met, MPL, 
Myc, NPM1, NRas, PDGFRA, PI3KCA, PI3KR1, RUNX1, SMO, PTCH1, LKB-1, RET, 
and WT1. 
A para
ffin-embedded tumor tissue block (from the primary tumor or metastasis) obtained at 
diagnosis may be used.  In the absence of paraffin-embedded tissue, 15 unstained paraffin-
embedded tumor slides are acceptable. 
5.4 Conco mitant Medications 
Patients will be instructed to notify the investigator of any additional medications taken 
(including over-the-counter products) during the course of the study.   
The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) should follow the American

after start of study treatment, including physical therapy and blood transfusions, should be 
recorded. 
The following restrictions apply during the entire duration of the trial:

Page 33 of 77 
  No othe r investigational therapy should be given to patients.   
 C oncomitant cancer treatment (e.g., biologic, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, 
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for disease progression) is prohibited.  If such 
tre
atment is required, then the patient must first be withdrawn from the trial.   
 No c hronic treatment with systemic steroids (at a dose equivalent of greater than 20 
mg prednisone per day) other than those used for premedication per protocol or 
treatment with immunosuppressive agents.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_598262]. 
 P atients requiring therapeutic warfarin or coumarin-derivative anticoagulants will be 
monitored with INR and Prothrombin Time as clinically indicated. 
 Caution should be used when administering nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs  
(NSAIDs) concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with mild to moderate renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance 45 -79 mL/min).  NSAIDs with short elimination 
ha
lf-lives (e.g., diclofenac, ind omethacin) should be avoided for a period of 2 days 
before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of pemetrexed.  NOTE:  No 
dose adjustment of pemetrexed is needed with concomitant NSAIDs in patients with 
normal renal function.  
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and 
NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these 
NSAIDs should interrupt NSAID dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 
days following pemetrexed administration.  If concomitant administration of NSAIDs 
is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, especially myeloid, 
renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity. 
Ibuprofen (400 mg four times a day) can decrease the clearance of pemetrexed; 
however, it can be administered with pemetrexed in patients with normal renal 
func
tion (creatinine clearance ≥80 mL/min).     
5.5 T reatment Assignment Unblinding Procedures 
There is no intention to routinely unblind individual patients at any time.  Individual requests 
for urgent safety unblinding require the approval of the Medical Monitor.   
There also may be instances where unblinding of a patient(s) may be required for a safety 
review at the request of the SCRI Innovations Medical Monitor or  DSM or for Regulatory 
Author
ity reporting requirements. 
After all patients have completed protocol treatment and the database has been locked, the 
trial will be unblinded for analysis of the safety and efficacy outcomes. 
6 DOS E MODIFICATIONS 
All toxicities will be graded utilizing the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE ).  If toxicity occurs, the toxicity will be graded, 
and appropriate supportive care treatment will be administered to decrease the signs and 
 
SCRI Innovations LUN [ADDRESS_791187] degree of toxicity.  A maximum of two dose reductions for the Study Drug or either 
chemotherapy will be allowed.  Patients requiring >2 dose reductions will be discontinued 
from the offending study drug/chemotherapy but will be allowed to continue on other 
agent(s) if appropriate.   
Doses of pemetrexed  and c arboplatin  as well as Study Drug if indicated will be modified 
based on hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity.  If dose reductions are necessary they 
will be permanent for the remainder of the treatment.  Doses will be adjusted according to the 
dose modification tables that follow.  Any patient requiring a toxicity-related dose delay of 
more than [ADDRESS_791188] be discontinued 
from the offending agent(s).

L.   Hematologic dose modifications apply only to Day 1 values of each cycle.  
Dose reductions are not based on nadirs occurring during the previous treatment cycle.  
Dose level modifications for pemetrexed, carboplatin, and Study Drug due to hematologic 
tox
icity are shown in Table 5.  For toxicities that lead to a dose reduction, the dose will not 
be
 re-escalated during subsequent cycles.  If hematologic parameters do not recover within 
≤3 weeks (21 days), the patient should be removed from the Study Treatment Phase and start 
the Ma
intenance Phase if appropriate (see Section 5.3).   
Gr
ade 3 and 4 anemia should be treated along ASCO and Institutional Guidelines.

p
atient will be removed from the study treatment. 
Note:   Hematologic dose modifications apply only to Day [ADDRESS_791190] dose modifications below, but not all, are for both chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  If 
grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity (other than nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, 
lethargy, or alopecia) occurs, treatment with  pemetrexed,  carboplatin, and possibly Study Drug 
(se
e below) should be held, and should be resumed at a one level dose reduction (see Ta ble 2 and 
Ta
ble 3) once toxicity recovers to ≤ grade 1.  If the toxicity is clearly attributable to one drug, 
then dose
 reduction of only that drug is necessary.  For example, if the toxicity is known to occur 
with onl
y one of the chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. neurotoxicity with carboplatin but not 
pemetrexed or diarrhea with pemetrexed but not carboplatin) the patient may remain on study 
treatment and only the offending chemotherapy will be held, dose adjusted, or discontinued.  
Althoug
h there is little evidence that OGX-427 increases toxicity above that of chemotherapeutic 
agent(s) it is administered with, except for infusion reactions, whether Study Drug is held, 
adjusted, or discontinued is up to the discretion of the treating Investigator.  For toxicities that 
lea
d to a dose reduction, the dose will not be re-escalated during subsequent cycles.  Any patient 
who de
velops grade 3 or 4 toxicity (in the Study Treatment Phase or the Maintenance Phase) that 
does not resolve to ≤ grade 1 within 3 weeks should be removed from the study treatment.

6.2.1 S pecific Non-Hematologic Toxicities   
[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea 
In the event of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are recommended:  
hydration, octreotide, and anti-diarrheals. 
If diarrhea is severe (i.e., requiring IV rehydration) and/or associated with fever or severe 
neutropenia (grade 3 or 4), broad-spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed.  Patients with severe 
diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598264].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Febrile Neutropenia 
Patients experiencing febrile neutropenia with significant symptoms should be managed in a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598265], with the urgent initiation of IV antibiotic 
therapy.  Patients with febrile neutropenia without symptoms should be managed according to 
standard guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Effusions 
For patients who develop or have baseline clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions 
(on the basis of symptoms or clinical examination) before or during initiation of pemetrexed 
therapy, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to dosing.     
[IP_ADDRESS] Motor Neuropathy or Muscle Weakness 
Any onset of > grade 2 motor neuropathy or > grade 2 muscle weakness should be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_598282] (EMG) to rule out the possibility of chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyneuropathy (CIDP). With a diagnosis of CIDP the patient should be discontinued from study 
treatment.  
6.3 Dose  Modifications for Infusion Reactions 
Infusion reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, bronchospasm, and hypotension) can 
occur with the agents used in this study.  There is increased risk of a reaction with carboplatin.  
C

INFORMATION 
8.1 S tudy Drug (OGX-427 or Placebo) 
This is a blinded study.  Access to treatment assignment codes will be restricted to one or more 
mixing pharmacists/nurses who will be responsible for maintaining assignment records and all 
Study Drug (OGX-427 or Placebo) preparation.  
OGX-[ADDRESS_791200] be stored in a 
secure, temperature monitored refrigerator, at a temperature of 2 - 8° C (36-46° F) until the time 
of
 use.  Do not freeze.  The drug substance and active ingredient of OGX-427 is an antisense 
oli
gonucleotide (ASO).  Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for complete information. 
OGX-427 dosing solutions will be administered intravenously preferably using an infusion 
pump.  Once mixed for administration, it is recommended that the OGX-427 dosing solution be 
administered within 24 hours if kept at room temperature or refrigerated (2-8° C, 36-46° F) .  
I
nvestigational drug accountability records will be maintained documenting the utilization of the 
study drug at the clinical site. 
Placebo will be D5W supplied by [CONTACT_159439].  An additional 40 mL of D5W will also be 
added to 250 mL of D5W so that the volume of placebo will be the same as the volume of OGX-
427 at each dose level to maintain the blind.  
8.1.2 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
The OGX-427 drug dilution procedure should be performed according to the instructions below 
and following proper aseptic technique:  
OGX-427 should be stored between 2 - 8° C (36 – 46°F) prior to use. 
Once dose instructions have been received from the site Investigator, remove OGX-[ADDRESS_791201] amount of OGX-427 from each vial using a 
syringe and a needle.  
To prepare Study Drug, begin with 250 mL of D5W, then add OGX-427, and additional D5W if 
required to the intravenous D5W solution, as shown in the table below.  For placebo add 40 mL

10 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 Anal ysis Population 
Sample size considerations are based on PFS and follow-up considerations are based on OS.  The 
media
n PFS in the control group (carboplatin with pemetrexed plus placebo) is estimated to be 
approximately [ADDRESS_791205] ratio (HR) of 0.60, corresponding to a median 
PFS in the experimental group (carboplatin with pemetrexed plus OGX-427) of 8.[ADDRESS_791206] 85% power to test this hypothesis using a one-sided log-rank 
at the 5% level of significance.  Based on a uniform 15-month accrual period, a minimum of 
approximately 12 months follow-up period for PFS and a loss to follow-up/nonevaluability for 
P
FS assessment rate of approximately 10% per year, a total of 155 subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 manner to achieve the targeted number of events in the scheduled PFS follow-up time.  
S
ample size and power calculations were performed using PASS 2008 software. 
10.2 S ample Size Considerations 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9.1 or higher. 
10.2.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. 
10.2.2 Stratification Factors 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_598284].  The stratification factors for this study are: 
Histology:   Large cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma.  Patients with mixed 
squamous/non-squamous histology are permitted provided the predominant histology 
is non-squamous and are to be stratified as adenocarcinoma.  Patients with NOS 
designation or small-cell elements are not permitted. 
 
SCRI Innovations LUN 229 Protocol Amendment 3  
05 November 2014 Version 4.0  
Page 50 of 77 
 Smoking Status:   Patients will be stratified as smokers or non-smokers.  Patients 
with a life
time history of <[ADDRESS_791207] not smoked for >15 years are also considered non-
smok
ers.  All others will be classified as smokers. 
10.2.3
 Efficacy Analyses 
All efficacy parameters will be analyzed using the intent- to-treat (ITT) population.  Efficacy 
pa
rameters may be additionally analyzed using the Safety population if more than 10% of 
randomized subjects do not receive study treatment. 
The efficacy endpoints are PFS (primary) and the objective response rate (ORR) and OS 
(secondary). 
10.2.4 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization 
to the date of the first observation of progression based on radiologic assessment (RECIST 
c
riteria version 1.1) or date of death, whatever the cause, in the absence of progressive disease 
(PD), or censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.  
The primary analysis is to conduct a comparison of PFS between the OGX-[ADDRESS_791208] ratio (OGX-427: placebo) and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence 
inte
rval (CI) will be estimated based on a Cox proportional hazards model using treatment group 
as the predictive factor.  Each treatment group will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves, 
along with the respective median time point and two-sided 95% confidence interval obtained 
from the product-limit estimates. 
10.2.5 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with objective evidence of 
a CR or a PR using RECIST criteria version 1.1.  ORR for each treatment group will be 
pr
esented as the point estimate along with two-sided 95% confidence intervals calculated using 
both asymptotic normal approximation and exact binomial methods.  Comparison of ORR 
be
tween the OGX-427 and placebo treatment groups will be performed using Fisher’s exact test. 
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the 
date of death, due to all cause, or censored at the date last known alive.  OS between the OGX-
[ADDRESS_791209].  Each treatment group will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves, along with the 
re
spective median time point and two-sided 95% confidence interval obtained from the product-
limit estimates.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_791210] of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and serious 
adverse events (SAEs); measurement of protocol specified hematology, and clinical chemistry 
variables; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that 
are deemed critical to the safety evaluation.  
The analyses of safety will be based on the frequency of adverse events and their severity.  Worst 
tox
icity grades per patient will be tabulated for select adverse events and laboratory 
measurements by [CONTACT_241561] v4.0. 
10.3 Anal ysis Populations 
The analysis populations for this study are the ITT and Safety populations. 
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects.  
Safety population will consist of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
treatment.    
10.4 P lanned Interim Analysis 
No interim analyses are planned. 
10.5 Data Safety Monitor  
Safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_598285] (DSM) who will be 
de
signated for this study since this will be the first evaluation of OGX-[ADDRESS_791211] 
be
en enrolled (6 patients per treatment arm) and treated for at least one cycle to assess the 
frequency of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_791212] been enrolled, for a total of 24 patients.  The 
fr
equency of further safety reviews will be determined by [CONTACT_598286]. 
The primary responsibility of the DSM will be overall safety for patients on the protocol.  The 
DSM
 will monitor the safety of individual patients during the entire adverse event reporting 
period (i.e., from the first administration of Study Drug through 30 days after completion of 
study treatment).  The sponsor  will  pr ovide the DSM with a copy of any unexpected Study Drug-
related SAE Report Form within 15 business days of receipt by [CONTACT_456].  The sponsor will 
a
lso provide the DSM with copi[INVESTIGATOR_598266].  
In addition, the DSM will:   
 P erform periodic reviews of all safety data for individual patients.  These listings 
would be based on the available safety data in the clinical study database and will 
include
: demographic characteristics, general medical history (including 
concurrent illnesses), disease history, Study Drug administration, vital signs 
during infusion, clinical laboratory data (serum chemistry, hematology), and 
reported adverse events. 
 
SCRI Innovations LUN 229 Protocol Amendment 3

Page 52 of 77 
  P erform continued monitoring of Grade 3 and higher adverse events and SAEs on 
an ongoing basis for all patients.   
 P erform toxicity reviews of the first 6 patients enrolled in Group 1 (OGX-427) for 
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the need for one dose-level reduction for 
weekly OGX-[ADDRESS_791213] six (6) patients 
enrolled in the OGX-[ADDRESS_791214] 2 or more DLTs during Cycle 1, the weekly dose of 600 mg 
of
 OGX-427 should be reduced for the remainder of the study to 500 mg for all patients.  There 
will
 be one dose reduction allowed for patients starting OGX-427 treatment at the weekly dose 
of 500 mg ( Table 4).  The loading dose will remain at 600 mg. 
Dose
-limiting toxicities will be defined as follows: 
 Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting >7 days;  Grade ≥3 febrile 
neutropenia; and Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia with Grade >2 hemorrhage; 
 Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity with the exception of:   
o Fatigue, malaise, lethargy, anorexia  
o Grade ≥3 diarrhea or nausea that resolves to ≤ Grade 2 within 48 hours   
o Gr

11.1 Adver se Events  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_14146] (see Section 11).  It is SCRI 
I
nnovation’s responsibility to report relevant SAEs to the applicable local, national, or 
inte
rnational regulatory bodies.  Oncogenex will be responsible for reporting to international 
regulatory bodies. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_791216].   
 
SCRI Innovations LUN 229 Protocol Amendment 3  
05 November 2014 Version 4.0  
Page 53 of 77 
 An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver), or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory 
finding
s). 
11.1.[ADDRESS_791217] during the course of the study will be recorded in the CRF, and the 
investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_14151] (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug administration).   
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including its date of onset and 
resolution, whether it constitutes an SAE or not, any action taken (e.g., changes to study 
treatment), and outcome, should be provided, along with the investigator’s assessment of 
causality (i.e., the relationship to the study treatment[s]).  For an AE to be a suspected treatment-
related event there should be at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the 
protocol treatment and the AE.  Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 4.0.    
If the AE is serious, it should be reported immediately to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  
Othe
r untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study are also to be recorded as 
AEs (i.e., AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a study-
mandated intervention, including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or 
no treatment run-in). 
Any
 clinically significant signs and symptoms; abnormal test findings; changes in physical 
examination; hypersensitivity; and other measurements that occur will be reported as an AE, and 
collected on the relevant CRF. 
Test findings will be reported as an AE if the test result requires an adjustment in the study 
dr
ug(s) or discontinuation of treatment; and/ or test findings require additional testing or surgical 
intervention; a test result or finding is associated with accompanying symptoms; or a test result is 
considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_093]. 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment, spanning from the start of 
study treatment, until [ADDRESS_791218] be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after discontinuation or 
completion of clinical trial-specific treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, oral medications, 
targeted therapy, and surgery).  All new AEs occurring during this period must be reported and 
followed until resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE or laboratory 
abnormality/ies are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the 
investigators must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the subject’s medical record 
and as a comment on the CRF.  After [ADDRESS_791219] medical occurrence that: results in death, is 
immediately life-threatening, requires at least a 24-hour inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76260], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or results in a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
The definition of SAE also includes any important medical event.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other 
situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the previous definition.  These should also usually be 
considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  Progression of malignancy 
(including fatal outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_206852] (for example, as per 
RECIST criteria for solid tumors), should not be reported as an SAE.  
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported): 
 Emer gency Department or Emergency Room 
 Outpatient or same-day surgery units 
 Obse rvation or short-stay unit 
 R ehabilitation facility 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_478781] 
 Nur sing homes, Custodial care or Respi[INVESTIGATOR_432642] a pre-planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was 
planned prior to entry in the trial), does not require reporting as an SAE to the SCRI Innovation 
Safety Department.  Deaths that are attributed by [CONTACT_598287]. 
11.2.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting by [CONTACT_241573] “serious” and “severe” adverse events, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea which persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which 
results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be 
 
SCRI Innovations LUN [ADDRESS_791220] be reported to the SCRI Innovations Safety Department as SAEs on the SAE 
R
eport Form and followed until resolution (with autopsy report if applicable). 
Deaths and other SAEs occurring >[ADDRESS_791221] study treatment that are deemed 
‘possibly’ or ‘probably’ related to study drug  must be reported as SAEs on the SAE Report Form 
withi
n [ADDRESS_791222] knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_14209] (with 
an autopsy report if available). 
Deaths occurring >[ADDRESS_791223] study treatment and not attributed to study 
treatment (e.g., disease progression) need not be reported as SAEs, but simply captured on the 
a
ppropriate CRF. 
To report an SAE, the SAE Report Form should be completed with the necessary information. 
The
 SAE report Form should be sent to SCRI Innovations Safety Department via fax or e-mail 
using
 the following contact [CONTACT_3031] (during both business and non-business hours):

Transmission of the SAE report Form should be confirmed by [CONTACT_598288]. 
Follow-up information for SAEs and information on non-serious AEs that become serious should 
also be reported to SCRI Innovations Safety Department as soon as it is available; these report s 
shoul
d be submitted using the SCRI Innovations SAE Report Form.  The detailed SAE reporting 
pr
ocess will be provided to the sites in the SAE reporting guidelines contained in the trial 
reference manual. 
Investigators must report SAEs and follow-up information to their responsible Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) according to the policies of the responsible IRB.

F
ax:   425-[ADDRESS_791225] medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or SAEs on 
the SAE Report Form and AE CRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
All AEs, including those that meet SAE reporting criteria, should be recorded on the AE CRF; 
AEs that meet the definition of an SAE should additionally be reported following the procedures 
noted in Section 11.2.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_791226]’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_171765], the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at 
the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate 
on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF).  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow-up information is available.  If a diagnosis is 
determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms 
should be updated to reflect the diagnosis. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_791227] evaluation 
timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the 
AE CRF.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be recorded on 
a
 separate SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation timepoints, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or 
AE CRF. 
11.3.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, 
the sig
n or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated laboratory value or 
vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant 
CRF.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs 
to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE CRF. 
Abnormal laboratory values will be reported as an AE if the laboratory result requires an 
adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment; and/ or laboratory findings 
require additional testing or surgical intervention; a laboratory result or finding is associated with 
accompanying symptoms; or a laboratory result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_093]. 
11.3.4 Deaths 
Deaths that occur during the study-specified AE reporting period that are attributed by [CONTACT_585127] “Trial Discontinuation” 
 
SCRI Innovations LUN [ADDRESS_791228] “Death NOS” on the CRF Adverse Event page.  
During post- trial survival follow-up, deaths attributed to progression of disease will be recorded 
only on the “After Progressive Disease Follow-Up” CRF. 
11.3.5 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] >24 hours or prolongation of preexisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598269].  There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_246721] (refer to 
Section 11.2) . 
11.3.6
 Pre-Existing Medical Condition 
A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the trial.  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History CRF.  A pre-existing medical condition 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition 
worsens during the trial.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF, 
it is important to convey the concept that the pre-existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_188215]. 
11.3.7 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies 
Pregnancy, abortion, birth defects, and congenital anomalies are events of special interest.  
Please refer to Section 11.[ADDRESS_791229] one of the serious criteria (See Section 11.2).  New primary cancers are those that are not 
the pr
imary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the 
inclusion of the subject into the trial.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  
Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are 
considered to be disease progression. 
11.[ADDRESS_791230], and will need to be reported expeditiously (see 
Section 11.2):  
Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies: 
If a subject becomes pregnant while enrolled in the trial, a Pregnancy Form (a paper report form) 
should be completed and faxed to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  If a pregnancy is 
c
onfirmed, the subject must not receive any study drug(s), and must be discontinued from the

 trial.  SCRI Innovations Safety Department should be notified expeditiously, irrespective of 
whether or not it meets the criteria for expedited reporting.  Abortions (spontaneous, accidental, 
or therapeutic) must also be reported to SCRI Innovations Safety Department. 
C
ongenital anomalies/birth defects always meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
e
xpeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously described process for SAE reporting.  A 
P
regnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to 
reflect the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Pemetrexed, Carboplatin or OGX-[ADDRESS_791231] be reported in the CRF.   Any accidental or 
intentional overdose with the study treatment that is symptomatic, even if not fulfilling a 
se

Page 60 of 77 
 Sponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial amendment to the protocol and 
other relevant study documents happen only after approval by [CONTACT_64379]. 
Safety updates provided by [CONTACT_598291]-427 will be prepared by [CONTACT_598293], for submission to the relevant regulatory authority. 
12.3 In surance and Indemnity 
Details of insurance and/or indemnity will be contained within the written agreement between 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_95936]. 
12.[ADDRESS_791233]'s decision to participate.  Informed consent is documented by [CONTACT_3553] a 
written, signed, and dated informed consent form. 
The
 informed consent form will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is responsible for 
review and approval of the trial.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements 
currently required by [CONTACT_1622], as well as local county authority or state regulations and national 
requirements. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial, each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the trial.  Once the essential information has been provided to the prospective 
candidate, and the investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications 
of participating in this trial, the candidate will be asked to give consent to participate in the trial 
by [CONTACT_21006].  A notation that written informed consent has been 
obtained will be made in the subject’s medical record.  A copy of the informed consent form, to 
include the subject’s signature, will be provided by [CONTACT_283590]. 
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the trial design or the potential risks to the 
subjects, the subject’s consent to continue participation in the trial should be obtained. 
12.4.[ADDRESS_791234]’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the  He alth 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIP AA) and national data prote ction laws, 
as applicable.  HIP AA regulations  require that, in order to participate in the trial, a subject must 
sig
n an authorization from the trial that he or she has been informed of following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this trial; 
 Who will have access to that information and why; 
 Who will use or disclose that information;  
 That health information may be further disclosed by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_64343], and 
that if the information is disclosed the information may no longer be protected by [CONTACT_64380];

  The  information collected about the research trial will be kept separate from the subject’s 
medical records, but the subject will be able to obtain the research records after the 
conclusion of the trial; 
 W hether the authorization contains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]; and 
 The  rights of a research subject to revoke his or her authorization.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, 
by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) 
at the end of their scheduled trial period. 
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and applicable parts of [ADDRESS_791235]’s original medical records at the site 
for
 verification of trial-related procedures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: only a unique trial number and initials will identify 
subjects on the CRF or other documents submitted to the Sponsor.  This information, together 
with t
he subject’s date of birth, will be used in the database for subject identification. Subject 
na
mes or addresses will not be entered in the CRF or database.  No material bearing a subject’s 
na
me will be kept on file by [CONTACT_2728].  Subjects will be informed of their rights within the ICF. 
12.4.[ADDRESS_791236] be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_460873], and submitted to the IRB at the Investigator’s facility for the board’s approval. 
Amendments specifically involving change to trial design, risk to subject, increase to dosing or 
exposure, subject number increase, addition or removal of new tests or procedures, shall be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_241578]’s facility. 
The amendment will be submitted formally to the FDA or other regulatory authorities by 
S
CRI Innovations as applicable, after IRB approval and specifically when an increase to dosing 
or
 subject exposure and/or subject number has been proposed; or, when the addition or removal 
of an Investigator is necessitated.

13.[ADDRESS_791238] of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated trial 
duties and should ensure that all persons assisting in the conduct of the trial are informed of their 
obligations.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on the CRFs are to be 
include
d on this document.  All entries in the subject’s CRF are to be supported by [CONTACT_598295]. 
Source documents are the original documents, data, records, and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_478782], observations, and activities from which the subject’s CRF data are 
obtaine
d.  These can include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
labora
tory, medico-technical department and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, ECG 
traces, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379],

system (Site Trial File/SSF or ISF) of all trial-related (essential) documentation, suitable for 
inspec
tion at any time by [CONTACT_10574]/or applicable regulatory 
authorities.  The ISF/SSF must consist of those documents that individually or collectively 
permit evaluation of the conduct of the trial and the quality of the data produced.  The ISF/SSF 
shoul
d contain as a minimum all relevant documents and correspondence as outlined in ICH 
GCP Section [ADDRESS_791239], at a minimum, should contain PI [CONTACT_2300], date drug shipped/received, 
date, quantity and batch/code, or lot number for identity of each shipment.  In addition, all 
original source documents supporting entries in the CRF must be maintained and be readily 
available. 
The Sponsor shall maintain adequate investigational product records and financial interest 
records as per 21CFR Part 54.[ADDRESS_791240] marketing 
application has been approved by [CONTACT_8415]; or, in the event that the marketing application has not 
been approved by [CONTACT_8415], for no less than [ADDRESS_791241] shipment / delivery of the drug for 
investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation. 
The IRB shall maintain adequate documentation / records of IRB activities as per 21CFR 
Part 56.[ADDRESS_791242] marketing

been approved by [CONTACT_8415], for no less than [ADDRESS_791243] shipment / delivery of the drug for 
investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation. 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or from the Sponsor or its 
representative, the Investigator additionally agrees to keep records, including the identity of all 
participating subjects (sufficient information to link records e.g., CRFs and medical records), all 
original, signed informed consent forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE Reporting forms, source 
documents, detailed records of treatment disposition, and related essential regulatory documents.  
The
 documents listed above must be retained by [CONTACT_404595] (generally [ADDRESS_791244] marketing approval).  SCRI Innovations will notify the 
investi
gator(s)/institutions(s) when the trial-related records are no longer required.   
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the trial, both SCRI 
Innovations should be prospectively notified.  The trial records must be transferred to an 
a
cceptable designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.  The 
Investigator must obtain the Sponsor’s written permission before disposing of any records, even 
if retention requirements have been met.    
13.4 Dat a Collection 
The trial CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the trial.  CRFs will be completed 
using
 the English language and should be kept current to enable the sponsor to review the 
subjects’ status throughout the course of the trial. 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only trial number, subject number, initials and date of birth 
will identify the subject in the CRF.  If the subject’s name [CONTACT_75502] 
(e.g., laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to 
S
CRI Innovations and replaced instead with the subject number and subject’s initials.  The 
investi
gator will maintain a personal subject identification list (subject numbers with 
corresponding subject identifiers) to enable records to be identified and verified as authentic.  
Subject data/information will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable 
local, state, and federal regulations. 
All data requested on the CRF must be supported by [CONTACT_391517]’s source 
documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, 
assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the CRF, a 
note should be created verifying that the field was “Not done” or “Unknown”.  For any entry 
errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should 
be provided. 
The investigator will electronically sign and date the subject CRF casebook indicating that the 
data in the CRF has been assessed.  Each completed CRF will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_978], 
once all data for that subject is final. 
13.5 T rial Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
Participation as an Investigator in this trial implies the acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_64376], the Sponsor, or its representative(s).

a The physical examination, medical history, concomitant medications recorded ≤30 days prior to trial entry, ECOG PS, CBC, CMP, and 12-lead ECG should be done ≤[ADDRESS_791251] to be repeated.  Scans to document evaluable 
disease (i.e., tumor measurement) should be performed ≤4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment.   The smoking history should be recorded at the baseline visit.    
b P
hysical examination will include measurements of height  and weight  at the baseline visit.  Physical examinations (PE) done at all other times during the trial will include only 
measurements of weight.         
c
 Vital signs (resting heart rate, blood pressure, oral temperature) will be collected at baseline and prior to each dose of OGX-427, and at anytime there are signs or symptoms of an infusion 
reaction. 
d  CMP will include measurements of glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO2, ALP, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), total bilirubin, total protein, and  albumin.      
e  ECG at baseline.  Repeat if clinical ly indicat ed.   
f  Pregnancy tests will only be performed in women of childbearing potential ≤[ADDRESS_791252] dose of study treatment. 
g  Correlative testing will include the collection of archival tumor tissues and blood samples.  Blood samples will be collected from all patients and assessed for serum levels of Hsp27.   At 
these time points, approximately 7 mL of blood will be collected (red topped tube).  In addition, a paraffin-embedded tumor tissue block (from the primary tumor or metastasis) obtained at 
diagnosis may be used for correlative testing.  In the absence of paraffin-embedded tissue, 15 unstained paraffin-embedded tumor slides are acceptable. 
h  Patients will be restaged after every 2 cycles (every 6 weeks , ±7days)  during Study Treatment Phase and Maintenance Phase.  Patients with progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity 
sh
ould be discontinued from the study; patients with stable disease or response to therapy will continue treatment. 
i  If adrenal glands are not captured in the CT scan of the chest, then a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be required.      
j  Patients without evidence of undue toxicity may continue treatment with study drug (OGX-427 or placebo) and pemetrexed until disease progression occurs as long as they are achieving 
clinical benefit and desire to continue therapy.      
k
  After patients complete therapy or are discontinued from the study they will visit the study center ≤[ADDRESS_791253].    
m
 Patients with documented disease progression will be followed every 2 months for survival status (e.g., date and cause of death) for up to [ADDRESS_791254]. Patients

 Appendix E: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) 
Subjects with Measureable Disease 
Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provided below.  The term 
“evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used, as it does not provide additional 
meaning or accuracy. 
Baseline Eligibility 
Measurable Disease:  Tumor lesio ns:  Must be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to 
be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 [ADDRESS_791255] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater 
than 5 mm).  
 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions 
that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should 
be recorded as non -measurable).  
 [ADDRESS_791256] X -ray. 
 
Skin lesions:   Documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Malignant lymp h nodes:   To be considered pathologically 
enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_791257] scan.  At baseline and in 
follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Non-Measurable Disease:  All other les ions, including small lesions (longest diameter 
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with >10 - to <15 -mm 
short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions.  Lesions 
considered truly non -measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or perica rdial effusion, inflammatory 
breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses, and abdominal organomegaly identified by 
[CONTACT_14236].  
 
SCRI Innovations LUN 229 Protocol Amendment 3  
05 November 2014 Version 4.0  
Page 74 of 77 
 Target Lesions:  The most reproduc ible measurable lesions, up to a maximum 
of 2 lesions per organ and 5  lesions in total, representative of 
all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline.   
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter), should be representative of 
all involved organs, and in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and that 
may be  identified as target lesions must meet the criterion or a 
short axis of >[ADDRESS_791258] scan.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diam eters.  If lymph nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the 
short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective 
tumor response.  
Non-Target Lesions:  All other  lesions should be identified as non -target lesions at 
baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout 
follow -up. 
15.1.[ADDRESS_791259] of a treatment. 
Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  
In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the s ize of the 
lesion, is recommended.  
Chest X -ray: Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
However, CT is preferable.  
 
SCRI Innovations LUN [ADDRESS_791260] and MRI:  CT is the best currently availa ble and reproducible method to 
measure target lesions selected for response assessment.  This 
guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5mm or 
less.  MRI of the chest should only be perform ed in 
extenuating circumstances.  Even if IV contract cannot be 
administered (for example, in the situation of allergy to 
contract), a non -contrast CT of the chest is still preferred over 
MRI.  
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor les ions.    
Ultrasound may be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by 
[CONTACT_12148].  
Endoscopy and 
Laparoscopy:  Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to 
measure tumor lesions. Such techniqu es can be useful in 
confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are 
obtained.  
Tumor Markers:  Tumor markers are not used to assess response in this 
protocol.  
Cytology and Histology:  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between 
PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., after treatment to differentiate 
between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions 
in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).

 15.1.2 Response Criteria 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response:  Complete disappeara nce of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph node (target or non -target) must have a 
reduction in short axis to < 10 mm).   
Partial Response:  
 A decrease from baseline of ≥30% of the diameter(s) of all 
target lesions.  
Stable Disease:   
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
(nadir) sum of the diameters of target  lesions while on study.  
Progressive Disease:   
 At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum while on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study), or the a ppearance of one or more new lesions.  
Requires not only 20% increase, but absolute increase of a 
minimum of 5 mm over sum.  
 
 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response:  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  All lymph nodes must 
be non -patholo gical in size (<10  mm short axis).  
Stable Disease:    
 Persistence of one or more non -target lesions.  
Progressive Disease:  
 Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions.  When the subject 
also has m easurable disease, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target 
disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in the target 
disease, the overall tumor b urden has increased sufficiently to 
merit discontinuation of therapy.  
 
SCRI Innovations LUN [ADDRESS_791261] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started).  In general, the subject’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.   
Target Lesions  Non-Target Lesions  New  Lesions  Overall Response  
CR CR NO CR 
CR SD NO PR 
CR NE NO PR 
PR SD OR NE  NO PR 
SD SD OR NE  NO SD 
PD ANY  YES OR NO  PD 
ANY  PD YES OR NO  PD 
ANY  ANY  YES  PD 
NE SD NO NE 
CR=complete response; NE=not evaluable; PD = progressive disease; PR=partial response; SD=stable disease. 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation 
of a CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by [CONTACT_254453][INVESTIGATOR_14166].  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions, and the nodes decrease to “normal” size (<10 mm), 
they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should be recorded even though the 
nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression, should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As 
noted earlier, this means that subjects with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the Case Report Form (CRF).
